Si è detto che la perizia è stata eseguita male (cosa verissima, come del resto un po' tutta l'indagine costellata di errori madornali nella raccolta delle prove!)

I really didn't think about it cricically enough as I was obviously about as unbiased as a die hard communist explaining free market economy to his kid. I'm tweaking off amphetamines, I guess? It makes you quick as FUCK at saying what's on your mind.

Really I am not boasting for the sake of it but I have never in my life had to practice a shit of English for top grades in school, which arrogantly I think is way too easy (it mostly is for top students, but that goes for all of school up to you reach university levels in Sweden), but  in reality my own little sister never stopped struggling for passing grades :(. She's not dumb either, just opposite of me in many intellectual ways,. My own father is even dyslexic while I am with words the same way many rich people are with numbers; I just get it. I never knew shit about grammar in either Swedish or English (I noticed not long ago that for really high levels you kind of have to know the rules, though), but because I was best in my class by far anyway. I felt when it wasn't correct and was for the levels we were at always right, but I could fail grammatical tests that only focused on rules. Honestly I think I only knew what a verb, noun, and adverb was for 90% of my school years, and that's for both Swedish and English.  . I recently tried the highest level English Cambridge test and I think I got like 2% wrong. I love learning more English every day, and I would find my English from four years ago to be of a noticeably lower level than it is today. It was still of a (for a foreigner) very high level, but as with most things the difference between the last 10% is often tougher and more substantial than going from 0% to 90%. Michael Jordan will beat level 90 (he's 100) basketball player every time, and a level 90 player will beat a toddler every time. To the untrained eye there is not even a difference, just as my sister could not tell a difference between my English today compared to when I was 15. while the best can probably see twenty errors or things they would have done better after five sentences of this comment post. I am aware of how much left there is for me to learn only because I know so much. 

I'm about equal in Swedish and English, I speak Swedish more naturally but my vocabulary for advanced and/or uncommon words (mostly in the sciences) is more extensive in English. I might understand 75% of a higher level science article written in English (failing because I don't understand the science mostly, not because of a language barrier), but were it translated to Swedish I would understand at least 25% less. I can't discuss science with anyone in Swedish on any regular basis nor do I read science written in Swedish; but so I read about science, history, philosphy, chemistry, and biology in English not only often but every day. 

Tried to explain black holes and the Schwarzchild radius to my sister recently,and it was terrible. I didn't even manage to translate ""peanut"" (the Earth would become a black hole if it was compressed to the size of a peanut!)to the Swedish term because my brain is really lame sometimes. She started laughing, but really I read and hear ""peanut"" at least as often as I hear it in Swedish which is 'jordnötter' and since she knows what 'peanut' means I didn't even have to translate it.

Das würde ich nicht sagen, die haben mindestens teilweise Verständnis für Kriegsflüchtlinge, das Problem ist nur das das Bild verzerrt ist: In den internationalen Nachrichten ist von Kriegen und Flüchtlingen die Rede, in regionalen tauchen immer mal wieder negativ und positiv Meldungen auf, und auf persönlicher Ebene fallen nur noch die auf, die tatsächlich durch das Netz gefallen sind. Das ruft dann Reaktionen hervor. Die Medien die dann nicht den pöbelnden Typ der wie ein Ausländer aussieht in den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln aufnehmen sondern das Kooperationsprojekt in einer Schule oder so, werden als Lügner interpretiert, diejenigen die es versuchen sich zu integrieren leiden unter dem negativen Einfluss derer die es nicht versuchen.

&gt;Es geht um das Glauben an eine größere Sache, deren Teil man selbst ist. Es ist Empowerement einer Bewegung um der Bewegung willen, weil ihr die Sache fehlt, für die sie kämpft.

Es gibt genug große Sachen an denen gearbeitet werden müsste, die die Politik aber ""übernommen"" hat, da kommen diese normalen Leute nicht ran, die werden ausmanövriert mit Experten oder mit politischer Korrektheit oder eben durch Marginalisierung oder Extremisierung durch die Medien.

Sie haben nicht *eine* große Sache, das hier geht glaub ich paar Ebenen tiefer. Wir haben in den letzten 10 Jahren verschiedene Versuche gesehen politischen Einfluss zu nehmen: die Piraten, die AfD, Stuttgart, regelmäßig Proteste gegen staatliche oder internationale Großprojekte, die alle mehr oder weniger gescheitert sind. Bei der AfD ist das vielleicht zu früh totgesagt, aber das ist jetzt nicht wichtig. Das die Einflussnahme scheitert heisst ja aber nicht das das Bedürfnis Einfluss zu nehmen befriedigt wird. Das wird dann nur entsprechend umgelenkt.

Ich denke diese Leute glauben an ein friedliches, gebildetes und nicht armes Deutschland, alles was davon abweicht, also Terror, Ruhestörung durch laut gesprochene fremde Sprachen oder Bettler werden als Bedrohung wahrgenommen.

is neutral as to country within the world that the immigrant comes from;

The main point of being in the EU is that people get the right to come/live/work/do business in your country while you can do the same in theirs. Just that you personally don't benefit from that right, doesn't mean other Britons don't get benefits off that. Would you rather prefer to require visas and tough bureaucracy whenever you want to travel/work/do business in another EU country. Maybe you would but that would be very bad for the British economy, which is not in a very good shape anyway.

&gt;considers the needs of the UK economy generally;

The UK has an aging population that cannot be sustained without immigration. Also, more people are living off benefits than ever before (and most people living off benefits are native Britons FYI).

&gt;considers the impact on specific sectors of the economy and in particular the poorest workers;

Can you expand on that? 

&gt;considers the impact on infrastructure; and 

Sorry but immigration is not to blame for poor infrastructure. The UK has failed to keep up with the developed world in terms of infrastructure. How many big projects have been completed in the last ten or so years? The sad truth is that British infrastructure is degrading and that's because of bad governance, not immigration.

Not really. IMO, Les Corts is where the bars aren't. If I were to hazard a guess, the kind of bars you'll be wanting are in Cuitat Vella. 

The beach is at Barceloneta, Vila Olimpica, Poblenou, shown on the [map here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Barcelona,+Spain/@41.3822654,2.1861042,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x12a49816718e30e5:0x44b0fb3d4f47660a?hl=en) as the yellow strip where the blue bit meets the brown bit.

Can't help you with night clubs as I'd sooner poke out my eyes with a plastic fork than go to a night club.

&gt; Given my dates, would it be beach season?

Not in mid-March. Yes, by mid-May. April will have some beach days and some not. The sea will be pretty cold though.

&gt; Would it be worth it to be by the beach?

Depends how important the beach is to you. You can easily get to the beach from any part of the city on the metro. There are a lot of tourist apartments in Barceloneta, some of them are even legal, and it's easy to walk from there to Gótico, Born, el Raval.

&gt; Also, how far are the two in walking distance?

There was a policy of keeping both parts on an equal footing, so when they conquered the Balearic islands and then Valencia, these adquisitions where given each the same status as the older territories, and the ""*Corts*""(parliament) of Aragon, were composed by the various Corts of each territory on a mostly equal footing.

While five and twenty is strange it is not absurd like the French way of saying ninety which is ""four twenties and ten"" :P

Edit: To clarify, I kind of only heard ""fem tyve"", hence the confusion. I think  ou pronounce twenty not nearly far enough from two, but I thought you said ""three five"" for ""fifty-three"" as well. I thought you changed directions and skipped the tens in everything between 10 and 100 I guess.

According to him, this is the document that will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval.

Compared with the previous version of the draft provisions of the Ministry of Information disappeared points that caused the most criticism in the media environment.

From the document removed points of state supervision over the activities of the media, TV production, development of national standards and professional standards of journalism. The Ministry of Information will only develop a social advertising standards and monitor their compliance.

Also in the updated version of the document disappeared points on implementation of state registration of the print media and news agencies, introduction of the state register of media.

A comedian friend of his went to a TV show and told the story, then the MP called in, then in a few hours his party held a press conference. Coincidence? I think not.

Saudi therefore has no reason to cut production because it'd essentially be the only one cutting production, pissing away money to bail out the rest of OPEC). If the world was in a better financial state we wouldn't be seeing such a massive drop in oil prices.

It is clear though that the USA has played a big part in the price crash through its boom in oil production. It has likely subsidised the production a fair bit to try to increase its soft power and reduce Russia's influence. Saudi Arabia is probably also quite happy with the side-effects that its oil policy is having on enemies Iran and Russia.

What people take issue with is the idea that the US ordered Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices and Saudi said ""ok."" In reality the US does not have that much influence over Saudi Arabia, hence why they still behead people for witchcraft over there. 

Don't forget that Russia's economic woes predate its invasion of Crimea. The whole reason Putin is doing this is to distract people from his economic mismanagement and unite the people against a common enemy.

I am not sure why you are still struggling with pronunciation?

A few **weeks** of hard practice using IPA sound charts of individual sounds, always practicing aloud everything German that you read, and collecting the real German sounds of a small core vocabulary, is the most any English speaker should need until late Intermediate or Advanced stage (conversing often with native Germans).

Ultimately, you should end up with only one or two sounds at most that you occasionally struggle with. Once you know what these are, you can specifically research them (Youtube can be particularly handy for this with the right channels, #) - just be very careful with them in all German you read, e.g. by confirming the whole word sound from native pronunciation held in an Anki deck or [online Duden](http://www.duden.de/woerterbuch) or software dictionary until it sticks.

Minimal pair training serves mostly as an adhoc check, confirmation or pronunciation refresher, if you speak a language within the same family, not as a continued learning method. What is there to learn once you've learned the sounds?

You can be guaranteed that, like many teachers, Gabriel did not use his own trainer or even many of the methods in it, to teach himself language pronunciation. Like many, he would have relied almost entirely on IPA or IPA-derived methods and natives.

I think this is a much more common attitude in the former Ottoman territories than it is in the rest of Europe. I have no more emotional attachment to Ukraine or Serbia than I do to Turkey (not that I have anything in particular against those countries). If Turkey was moving towards the European sphere, culturally, politically, and militarily, they would be valuable members, barring some issues such as the size of the population.

I have found that for some reason heavy accents is harder for native speakers of another accent to understand than it is for someone that does not natively speak the language. I have several examples but the most vivid is when a Starcraft 2 caster called Kellymilkies who had a very heavy Asian accent. She got sooo much hate from English natives because apparently they actually didn't even understand what she was saying half the time, while me and my friend understood everything she said just fine, and he isn't even at my own genius level ;). Just kidding, and he is still above average but obviously worse that the natives that didn't understand her. I want to say I specifically read several other Europeans saying the same thing, but I'm not fully certain.

I'm not certain but what I do know is that I find deep south accents to be funny, and not difficult to understand .I probably understand it fine but obviously not as good as ""TV-American"", which is a thing, I think?

Altri mesi passano, anche se felicemente sposato, non avevo nessuno con cui parlare italiano, mi mancava andare fuori con gli amici la sera, il poter dire le cazzate ed essere capito al voto, il poter parlare senza dover girare intorno alla frase per far capire il punto perche non conoscevo abbastanza parole...

Poi iniziai ad odiare tutti quelli intorno a me.. sono diversi, e non si ""adattano"" alle mie usanze che sono giuste e le loro sono sbagliate...

Poi mi resi conto che ero cretino a pensarla cosi', ma altri mesi erano passati.  Dopo 2 anni decisi di ritornare in Italia a far visita, a reincontrare i miei amici e famiglia.  ma era tutto diverso, e miei amici erano diversi, sempre buoni amici ma io mi sentivo ""cresciuto"" e loro non lo erano

Ritorno in US dopo la vacanza, altri mesi passano ed inizio ad amare dove sono, come la gente la pensa e ne capisco il motivo culturale.

Altri mesi e ripenso ai miei viaggi in italia, non ero io cresciuto, ne erano loro quelli che non erano maturati, ma la cultura dove ora vivo e' in me e tante cose le comprendo ma non capisco, non ne capisco i motivi ed anche se mi fanno ridere ci sono sempre cose che alla fin fine non mi tornano piu'.. detti, usanze, etc...

Ora sono oltre 12 anni che vivo in US, mi sono appena sposato per la seconda volta.  Dopo il primo divorzio ho pensato a ritornare in italia e restarci, ho cercato posto per vivere, ma anche il parlare con l'agente immobiliare mi facera .. blah... quell'accento livornese.. ma perche' non parla italiano quando parla di lavoro ?  il customer service che manca quasi completamente quando parlo con qualsiasi biz in the livorno area... WTF... the paycheck that is not comparable (I am a CTO here in US) and friends and family that have kids and moved on in a different direction. 

I am happy now, but I am a man of two worlds, not italian, not american.  In either country I hear people telling me ""parli un buon italiano"" o ""you speak a good english"" ... Ci vuole parecchio ad accettare dove sei e cosa sei diventato dato che il posto dove vivi non sara' mai come casa, e neanche casa lo sara' piu'",0,1419023386,null,0,false,0,cmzx2ra,t3_2pt75v,t1_cmzx2ra,t3_2pt75v,null,1425312058,24,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,24

- Non cercare fin dall'inizio la sistemazione perfetta: per affitti e trasporti Londra e' una citta' brutale. Trova una sistemazione 'accettabile' e metti in conto di poter traslocare in seguito, appena hai le idee piu' chiare su dove vuoi vivere. Molto dipende anche dai trasporti pubblici e dal percorso per andare a lavorare.

- Londra e' una megalopoli che cambia tantissimo a seconda del quartiere dove sei. E' anche molto costosa; ma, potendo scegliere, forse e' meglio spendere un po' di piu' per una sistemazione piu' carina (e meno tempo a fare la pendolare). Quale quartiere fa per te, ti conviene cercare di scoprirlo da sola: e' una citta' troppo grande e varia..

- Molte cose ti sembreranno molto piu' semplici che in Italia, specialmente per quanto riguarda burocrazia, banche e tasse; questo e' un aspetto molto positivo. Un altro (enorme) aspetto positivo e' il lato lavorativo; con un po' di networking scoprirai che, se sei brava e hai voglia di fare, ci sono sempre tantissime opportunita' e porte che si schiudono - basta saperle cercare.

- Fra gli aspetti piu' negativi, un tempo (ora non piu') c'era il problema del cibo; ma tuttora di dovrai scontrare con 'divergenze' estetiche abbastanza traumatizzanti, tipo case in genere bruttissime e (orrore) moquette in bagno, anche sotto il water. Porta pazienza.

*CORREZIONE: Nella domanda *, in una prima versione dell’intervista riassumevo con «deportare» l’espressione da me pronunciata «mettere milioni di musulmani su degli aerei (o su delle navi, aggiunge lui) per cacciarli». Zemmour sostiene che, in francese, «deportare» ha una connotazione diversa e peggiore, e che questo avrebbe dato un’idea diversa della sua risposta. Non sono sicuro che, in francese come in italiano, «mettere milioni di musulmani su degli aerei o delle navi» sia più lieve che «deportare milioni di musulmani».

Would you rather prefer to require visas and tough bureaucracy whenever you want to travel/work/do business in another EU country.

My preference would be for the UK to negotiate an extensive new relationship with the rEU, without the need for visas or extensive bureaucracy for doing business, a bit like the relationship that many other countries in the world have with the eu. However, even if that weren't possible, I still think the UK should leave the eu.

&gt;The UK has an aging population that cannot be sustained without immigration. Also, more people are living off benefits than ever before (and most people living off benefits are native Britons FYI).

The UK's demographic trends are not as negative as you portray. As mentioned, I am very pro-immigration into the UK. The UK is fortunate in that many people from around the whole world want to come here. Our immigration policy should not favor Europe, but should treat the whole world equally.

&gt;Can you expand on that?

It might be the case that a particular level of immigration benefits the UK economy as a whole, but that certain sectors of uk society do not benefit. If this is the case, the policy should be refined so that the policy is more equitable.

&gt;Sorry but immigration is not to blame for poor infrastructure. The UK has failed to keep up with the developed world in terms of infrastructure. How many big projects have been completed in the last ten or so years? The sad truth is that British infrastructure is degrading and that's because of bad governance, not immigration.

I'm not sure why you are implying that I think immigration is responsible for UK infrastructure. It should have been obvious from my comment that this is not my position. For the avoidance of doubt, I belive that infrastructure is the responsibility of the British government. However, immigration obviously has an impact on infrastructure and to the extent that the UK government does not ensure infrastructure keeps pace with immigration it should change policies.

That's not what the primary focus of the Indy ref was, though. The hard-core SNP may well be ""We want independence whatever may come"", but they were selling it to everyone else in Scotland by saying that everyone would be richer an independent Scotland, and oil would pay for everything from further education to free massage sessions. 

Now, jaw-droppingly, they're pretending that they never said that at all.

Certes, mais les échecs et Warhammer (les wargames en général, mais c'est le seul que je connaisse) ont pour base historique la réalité (simuler des affrontements armés). Selon ta logique, Warhammer est donc bien meilleur que les échecs, puisqu'il permet d'être bien plus fidèle à la réalité. Sauf que depuis bien longtemps, les deux n'ont plus pour vocation d'être une restitution réaliste d'un affrontement.

Pour moi, les arts martiaux c'est pareil, ils se sont suffisamment distingués de leur racine historique pour qu'il soit devenu abscons de les comparer ainsi. Pour moi, le meilleur art martial, c'est celui qui te plait le plus et qui est le plus proche de tes attentes, point final. Pour toi, ce sera le MMA (parce que tu estimes qu'il est important qu'un AM soit le plus proche possible d'une situation de combat réel), pour moi, ce sera le judo ou la boxe française, parce que j'aime l'esprit sous-jacents de ces sports, j'aime leur histoire et leur pratique me satisfait. On a des attentes différentes, je vois pas pourquoi un seul critère (la proximité ""réelle"") devrait déterminer lequel est le ""meilleur"".

Surtout que, à mon sens, le MMA n'est que marginalement plus réaliste que les autres sports, puisque je pense sincèrement que la caractéristique la plus importante de la réalité, c'est qu'elle n'est pas juste.

Nonsense. People abuse the term ""dictatorship"" far too much.

It's fairly common for political ideologies to work to build up popular opinion from basically zero to where they need it to be. This happens all the time in democracies - and if you pay attention, you'll see that the politicians do not willingly **listen** to popular opinion (unless they're losing or desperate), they actively attempt to **create** it. 

Popular opinion polls are merely a measure of how successful a political faction is at promoting their ideology. So long as they use democratic methods to do that, talking about dictatorship is silly.

It starred Montgomery Clift and was shot *in West Berlin the year after the blockade ended!!* It is half documentary - showing the real lives of West Berliners who were still rebuilding the rubble of WWII - and half Hollywood love story, between Clift, USAF Pilot, and the German widow he falls in love with.

I enjoyed the movie immensely, because it is so very real and very historical.  
You have to pay attention to catch the German dialog. Not just because of the Berliner accent, but also its delivery, which is in the typical 1940s machine-gun (rat-a-tat-tat) style and speed. (Think Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday"")

&gt;The __Berlin blockade__ (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949) was one of the first major international crises of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War). During the [multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany), the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) blocked the [Western Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Allies)' railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) under allied control. The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced Deutschmark from West Berlin. In response, the Western Allies organised the __Berlin [airlift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift)__ to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin.   Aircrews from the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force), the British [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force), the [Royal Canadian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force), the [Royal Australian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force), the [Royal New Zealand Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force), and the [South African Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Air_Force)  :338 flew over 200,000 flights in one year, providing up to 4700 tons of necessities daily, such as fuel and food, to the Berliners.  Neither side wanted a war; the Soviets did not disrupt the airlift.

This is the case of the Mediterranean corridor, the railway that should connect from South to North all the Spanish litoral and entering the EU, basically to import or export which means a huge boost of the competivity of the these cities which are already doing the best in Spain, and the boost of competivity of the ports and in general the economy of the country. But nope, Spain instead wants to take this railway to Madrid, drilling the Pyrinees in a pharaonic construction to bring the train to Madrid which has no port whatsoever and the impact that this infraestructure would mean for the economy would be incrdibly low compared to the Mediterranean project which is held back by the EU, obviously. This is just an example but it is only to make it clear that it's not all about patriotism, there are independentists here that don't even know Catalan or feel exclusively Catalan.

You know the average American (or Swede for that matter) in 1870 was probably as knowledgable as todays average American 15-year old. I mean Sweden was pretty awesome (we are eternally amersome) in the 1870's but most of the world was absolute shit. You have other stuff to be ashamed about, for example all the poverty today in your by most measures very rich country. Sorry if that comes off as a douchebag thing to say, I don't mean to.

And I know it probably could be interpreted like I think there's a unified ""deep south"" accent but I used it for the same reasons you said ""deep south"": for simplicity while knowingly generalizing hard. The only ones I know off the top of my had that I can pinoint (speaking as generally as possible here) would be Texan and Georgian. I have no idea what even the accent in Miami is. Scarface is probably a bad example :D.

 I know how inredicly large the US is, and while being third largest in the EU Sweden is like 60% the size of Texas alone.

And to my defence I namedropped like five very, very distinct dialects found in the UK, and the UK is *half* the size of even Sweden with one sixth as many citizens as the US, so obviously there should be more equally diverse and unique accents of English in the US! :) It'a just that I don't think you can (generally) find accents as diverse as say the ones found in Liverpool or Dublin (likely by more than 500K, possibly 1 mil) in any American city that populated. You have distinct working class accents in Boston, New Jersey and New York with loots of speakers for example, but they are not really on the levels of my British examples, I think! And I doubt anyone needs subtitles either way :)

I have heard isolated Swedish dialects that sounds like 50% alien, but there might be 50 to 500 people that speaks that particular dialect. I think Swedish is otherwise very unified and we certainly don't subtitle Swedish media for any reason other than hearing impairments.

The Creeoles is cheating as at least in the case of creole French it's another language and not an accent. Are you sure you those subtitles are not for the hearing impaired? A majority of the thousands of English subtitles I've acquired through the years was made with the hearing impaired in mind. Another reason I can think of is that in the case of low budged docuumentaries it's easier to just make an English subtitle. For every immigrant somewhat new to America it will still be much easier to understand and keep up because they might understand if it's said clearly and without AK47's firing in the background, and with subtitles you get plenty of time to read and take in what is being said. Badly mixed (too much background noise and too high volume differences comes to mind) and/or to me boring or uninteresting films can be hard to follow simply because I can't focus on actually listening to what they're saying. With subtitles in Engish or Swedish I can follow with alcohol levels ten times over the legal driving limit (in the Uk, where it's more than twice as high as in Sweden!) while giving oral sex and writing a story by pen and paper all at the same time.

I can't watch a movie without English subtitles (I recently watched Twilight without, but it's so embarrassingly cringeworthy that I have to take breaks every five minutes) because I go insane if I miss one word (of a good movie), and it's really miss here because if I understand it in Swedish I understand it in English.

Turkey is a large country, militarily relatively powerful, with a culture that is profoundly different from the rest of the EU, being much closer to the Arabic world from EU's perspective while often being viewed as much too progressive in the Arab world. In addition, the autocratic developments that have lead Turkey ever farther away from democracy over the last 10 years make the country seem even more alien to the rest of the EU.

Turkey's history as an invader in Europe has left deep scars in its neighbors that haven't yet healed even after centuries, leading to some members being against having Turkey in EU just on general principle. However, Turkey's geopolitical importance is huge and whether or not the country is friendly to the West has huge strategical value.

On top of it all, there is a sharp difference in how EU is regarded by some of its members that puts the latter in 2 categories. Some countries view the EU as an ever tighter integration process that over long periods of time may lead to a [con]federation or even a single state. Other countries view the EU as strictly a business partnership that will never affect their sovereignty. One of the loudest members of the latter group is the UK, which is a big supporter of having Turkey in the EU as they see it as being good for business. Countries in the former group are not so quick to greenlight Turkey's membership because they see Turkey as a very odd ball that would pose great difficulties in the future evolution of the EU integration process.

You could even be technically correct by telling the whole world that the USA shouldn't be referred to as ""America"", but nobody would care. It's a word so commonly used when referring the USA, it has become synonymous with the USA. It is the accepted meaning of that word.

The fact that also 'Britain' is synonymous with the country is why we use '**Great** Britain' (along with it being its official name) to specify the big island; like we use ""**North** America"" or ""the America**s**"" when referring to those continent(s). Someone usually wouldn't just say ""America"" because the word is so commonly used when referring to the USA, it would likely lead to confusion.

It's an old article already and quite a lot has happened since then. Yes, at the time the CB did interventions, and this week also the Finance Ministry joined in doing that. Additionally, the Russian government has started instructing exporters to sell their earned currency faster and monitoring that.

The CB's main strategy has been and is to dry up liquidity: [Ruble Advances as Cash Crunch From Higher Rates Supports Demand](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-19/ruble-advances-as-cash-crunch-from-higher-rates-supports-demand.html)

That strategy, while it may spare the dollar reserves, has some nasty side effects such as deepening the coming recession, increasing nonperforming loans and companies going bust, and also things like this: [Russian interbank lending rate soars](http://www.ft.com/intl/fastft/253531)

&gt; Russian banks are getting cautious about lending each other money, with the interest rate on three-month interbank loans hitting its highest since at least 2005.
&gt;
The three-month ""mosprime"" interbank lending rate has soared to 28.3 per cent, which is its highest since it hit its financial crisis peak of 27.6 in January 2009.
&gt;
The rate is also sharply higher than it reached on Wednesday - the day after the Central Bank of Russia hiked interest rates to 17 per cent to stem a plunge in the rouble - when it closed at 22.33.
&gt;
Stresses have been building in Russian economy because of Western sanctions and a sharp fall in the oil price (see chart).
&gt;
But another reason for the mosprime spike is that Russian banks are unsure about the state of each other's businesses. 

Now, what makes the Russian banks so wary about trusting other Russian banks? That's partly because of another policy adopted this week: [Bank of Russia Bolsters Lenders as FX Debt Payments Loom](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-17/bank-of-russia-bolsters-lenders-as-fx-debt-payments-loom-1-.html)

&gt; “The most important measure is this **use of third quarter valuation for risk-weighted assets at market to rates**,” Natalia Berezina, banking analyst at UralSib Capital, said by phone. “This is a big boost as some banks would fail to meet central bank regulatory capital ratios at their current levels.” 

So some banks would already fail meeting the capital ratios. And the regulator says for now on it's okay to have Potemkin style balance sheets by simply **pretending** the assets are as valuable as they were months ago. And, because the bankers already know the holes in their own balance sheets, they certainly won't trust other banks more now as they all have pretended value assets and balances.

And we know the banks certainly have holes in their balance sheets because even with the new Potemkin style balance calculations they already need a bailout of 1 trillion rubles ($16.5 billion) which was rushed through the duma yesterday: [Russia's parliament rushes through bill boosting banking capital](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/19/us-russia-crisis-banks-capital-idUSKBN0JX0R620141219)

EDIT:  
What we're wittnessing here is the first steps of a vicious cycle: economic crisis -&gt; currency crisis -&gt; financial crisis.

false,Holmoen,SWED,Sweden,"Huh, today I learned about hypercorrection. The Swedish example on the English wiki is pretty bad though. I remember my sister did just that one; when she was like eight or nine. Even if I tried she could not percieve any audible difference between the two distinct versions (the wrong one adds a -donde in the end when it's supposed to just be -one). She also said ""gladiatorierna"" when it's supposed to just be ""gladiatorerna"" (the gladiators) and she just could not hear that there was a difference. Ten years tops, really. 

Regrettably I don't really understand for certain what you're saying, do they pronounce the German word ""service"" which is correctly pronounced like in English with an audible 's' as ""servii"" because it's pronounced that way in French and they think they know a lot because they found out about loan words, maybe? We hade loaned that one to Swedish, Danish and Norwegian as well and it's pronounced as in English (you would barely hear a difference if my  89-year old grandmother said service or if Barack Obama said service) with the last 's'-sound audible. 

I'll check but I assume the English loaned the word from the French and French derived it from Latin, the Scandinavians loaned it from the English and/or you Germans. You probably took it from the French around the age of enlightenment or something like that. 

Unsurprisingly there is a Latin forefather in ""servitium"" which means service, servitude, bondage. The more you know! Who can say no to bondage, anyway?

Trivia: Did you know that from the 1800s' (possible a bit earlier, but way earlier it was French for some time) up until mostly the end of WW2 almost every Swede that was anything (the elite) spoke fluent German? It was cooler to speak German so the plebs didn't understand than English during that time. Up until the first world war since 1871 you were by many accounts the most powerful country in the world and Sweden traded a lot with northern Germany.

Another! To get enough marble and granite for his insane plans for Berlin Hitler bought a looooot of it from Sweden and some institution in Berlin actually payed on time (there is records proving this) until the very week before you surrendered, and we're not talking small amounts of cash, either. I mean most saw that after Stalingrad you were fucked, but no, you continued paying with money you kind of didn't even have for another two years for something that would probably never even happen. I mean, Hitler himself had lived for months in the fucking bunker when still someone payed for that damn marble in a timely fashion.

Its use among the general population became widespread only from the 1950s, so standard Italian is actually a pretty young language. The only proper *dialects* of Italian are the variations found in Tuscany. The others are called dialects by Italians simply for simplicity's sake, as linguistically they are their own languages, and they often have very little to nothing to do at all with standard Italian. To me, Sicilian, Sardinian, Lombard, Genoese and so on are completely incomprehensible, much like a foreign language.

false,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; On the second point, I think you are looking at it the wrong way. Net savings in the private sector + foreign sector goes up because the government's running a deficit.

Can you clarify this for me? We know it to be an identity, that government deficit = non-government surplus.

Now when you have an identity like that, *at most* one of the two sides can be volitional. That is, chosen by the party running it.

So either you can claim ""households can control their budgets"" or ""governments are in control of their budgets"", but *not both*. You can also of course argue that neither are in complete control, but that one side might be able to assert more control over theirs than the other.

That'd be my stance. I'd argue that the millions of households with their own individual budgets are better able to control their level of savings than the government can its singular budget, that's largely determined by automatic stabilisers. I'd argue that's why budgets keep on blowing out, why there's continually ""unexpected revenue drops"", etc. Because households are succeeding in saving. It's not governments *choosing* to run deficits, rather having them forced upon them.

&gt; Greece got screwed because it had a shitty government, not the eurozone. Sure it couldn't print it's way out of debt but that just postpones the problem

If the debt's denominated in your own free floating currency, printing isn't inflationary. Look at the US - printed away $4tn of their debt (~1/3rd of their entire debt) and they've [consistently undershot](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/06/18/inflation-continues-to-undershoot-fed-target/) their inflation target. This is despite the Fed doing all it can to drum up inflation expectations by telling people how much it's printing, that it'll meet its target, etc.

Look at the UK. Extensive QE there too, [very low inflation](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/14/uk-inflation-falls-five-year-low-what-economists-say).

What *is* inflationary, and what you're no doubt thinking of, is when a government borrows a currency other than their own and then prints their own to try and pay it back. That results in a decline in their currency's value (as they're literally buying up the supply curve of the foreign currency) and inflation results. For this, look at Argentina/Zimbabwe/etc.

But a Greece that borrows only its own free floating drachma would never have experienced a debt crisis. And even if they did (I can't see how), the central bank could have bought up bonds as needed to show the market that they remain the safest drachma denominated investment, without consequence, restoring faith.",0,1419036258,null,0,false,0,cn034cb,t3_2ppztt,t1_cn034cb,t1_cmzq0cg,null,1425309166,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

C’est un roman que les anglo-saxons rangent dans les *young adult*, mais le lecteur ciblé est plutôt un peu plus âgé car on ne profite vraiment de l’histoire que quand on a un certain bagage culturel (oui, je suis un lecteur élitiste).

&gt; Prenez Harry Potter, Narnia, the Golden Compass, Earthsea, et autres histoires d’apprentissage de la magie avec des épreuves ritualisées; ajoutez-y du sexe et de l’alcool, et teintez le tout d’une touche de noirceur amère et d’humour cynique. Vous obtiendrez The Magicians.
&gt; 
&gt; Les geeks reconnaîtront au passage des références à Nethack, Doctor Who, Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Donjons &amp; Dragons, etc.

&gt; Le livre se lit très facilement, et les personnages sont attachants malgré des stéréotypes tels l’adolescent-doué-mais-un-peu-dépressif-et-en-colère-contre-le-monde ou la fille-surdouée-mais-timide-qui-se-révèle-après-du-sexe-impromptu.
&gt; 
&gt; L’auteur joue avec les archétypes d’histoires, de lieux, et de personnages. On en passe beaucoup en revue, au travers du prisme d’un groupe de post-adolescents surdoués et légèrement névrosés. Ça pourrait ressembler à la vrai vie, mais la magie amplifie tous les aspects. L’histoire commence à un Hogwarts des alcooliques, et se termine dans un monde ressemblant à Narnia mais avec beaucoup plus de sang, le tout après avoir retourné une partie des bars de New York.

While on the topic of international hits, I've heard good things about the newer ones, ""The Bridge"" and ""Borgen"" as well. I haven't seen them, but the general consensus is that they are good.

For movies, I recommend the old school classics ""Blinkende lygter"" and ""Adams Æbler"". The newer, more recently released ""A royal affair"" and ""The Hunt"" are really good as well with surprisingly good production value and plots with the lovely actor that is Mads Mikkelsen.

But yeah, there is definetly a sector who loves classism and forgets the fact that Barcelona and its region has been heavily subsidized by all of spain, to grow its industry and now they try to forget about that fact and point that there is a lot of money there and they dont want to share it with everyone else. Now there is the cultural aspect, a lot will claim its because they used to be a nation (they were actually part of Aragón, which is where they got their colors from in fact. These are Aragón's colors) and they have been oppresed for years. Now this is true for them but its also true for a lot of other regions in Spain, Asturias, Galicia or Pais Vasco also were nations on their own, with their cultures and languages, were also oppresed (one of the Franco politics was massive centralization and an exacerbation of nationalistic sentiments since he was evil but not stupid, not entirely at least. he already knew Spain is just a mixup of a lot of nations), their languages were also forbid to be spoken (Not so fun fact, Franco was from Galicia and that did not stop him from forbiding speaking Galego) and their dissent populations were also routinely massacred. So they are not that much of a special snowflake, just one more of us. Then, the at least for me, key of the question lies in what is going on in Spain and well, on the rest of the world. First there was the crisis, while there always was independent sentiment on their population, it was never as accentuated as it is now, partly because their politicians are the usual run of the mill piece of shit you find around here, they are just like the ones in Madrid, routinely sacking everything thats left, selling public companies to private investors who are often their friends in exchange for a life free of worry when they retire after their 5-10 years of politics on a safe chair of the council of some emprise thhat bribed them, now while on the rest of Spain the growing disdain towards our wasteful politic caste is on the rise, in Cataluña it seems like they found an easy solution to save face. Blame Madrid. Its the panacea, the solution and our fucking doom all at the same time, people will blindly follow that bullshit after being radicalized, even after several catalan politicans have been convicted of the same shit Madrid pieces of waste do, it is to no avail, people really believes that once they are free from the reigns of Spain, there will be no corruption and that everyone in Cataluña is free of sin. Add a mixup of exceptionalism, romantic bullshit and classism and you have a good chunk of the population not only letting themselves get fucked in the ass but also saying thanks and cleaning the sheets and making the bed again so they can continue to be being fucked.

The people who work at Google that I know are some pretty darn decent folks.  And I do think that Google produces some exceptional products.

The problem is simply that Google has so much potential to be really nasty down the line with data that they gather now: they have more data than just about anyone else and lots of people to mine it and extract value from it for many years down the road.

If it wasn't Google, it would be someone else, but it really bothers me for any company (or government, frankly) to have so much information about me as their property.  I expect them to be under not merely short term, but also long term pressure to make an increasing return from this information.

Google knows what I was thinking about and working on a year ago today; heck, I don't even know that.  It knows a lot of the people I send emails to and those I send messages to.  Even though I use a lot of mechanisms to make life more-difficult to mine data (and most people don't know how and couldn't do this), they can probably fairly-reliably watch my travels around the Web due to various ad and analytics services that they provide to the Web.  They can see financial transaction data for a number of purchases.  They often see outsourced search information on third-party sites, and can via a number of sources tie this to cell phone location and other cell data.  And none of this information will go away, and very large numbers of bright people will spend time figuring out how to do ever-more large-scale automated analysis of this.  There's a huge information disparity there.  That's a concern to me.

I don't know if laws are the answer (How would you reasonably enforce regulations of this sort?  If Google played by the rules, could someone who didn't just displace them?), but I am unhappy with the situation as a whole.

I was maybe 2/3's through up until a month or so ago when I decided to stop messing around and get serious. I switched to the version without duplicates and started running through it from the beginning. Then I noticed I was pretty close to the top of the weekly leaderboard (my username there is the same), so I used the leaderboard as a goal. The last few hundred words went by quickly.

I'm pretty satisfied with it, personally. I'm definitely using other methods at the same time (Michel Thomas, Assimil, and random other stuff) but there's no getting around learning vocabulary. 

One surprising (but not unexpected) benefit of learning vocab is that with it comes pattern recognition. For some reason, when I read a grammar book my mind trails. Or I'll read it and understand what it says, but it will not stick. On the other hand, if I'm using memrise and I start to see a pattern, I'll remember it.

For example, I've noticed solely through learning vocab that the definite article will tend to match the last part of a compound word. For example der Arzt + das Tier = der Tierarzt.

One year ago people on this sub thought Russia was a partner and the US was Europe's biggest enemy. They went as far as to call the US ""imperialist"" for having its forces stationed in Europe. I remember a thread that was discussing peoples opinions of US forces in Europe, and the majority opinion was clearly the US should leave.

This ignores the fact many European nations rely more on arms manufacturing as a percentage of GDP than the US. European leaders claimed a military deterrent was no longer necessary.

&gt; Qui va payer la retraite quand la pyramide des ages va s'inverser

Ils ne paient les retraites de personne vu qu'ils [coutent des dizaines de milliards aux finances de l'état](http://www.economiematin.fr/news-cout-immigration-france-ocde) et qu'ils ont un chômage bien plus élevé que la population majoritaire. Ce sont les non immigrés qui paient pour eux et pas l'inverse.

Pour payer les retraites il faudrait qu'ils aient assez de travail mais ils sont tellement pauvres et au chômage que ça ne risque pas d'arriver. 

Rends toi bien compte que le [logement social représente environ 56 % de l’habitat des immigrés d’Afrique subsaharienne et d’Algérie. Avec plus de 40% viennent les immigrés du Maroc, les originaires d’un DOM et les immigrés de Turquie](http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/histoire-de-l-immigration/questions-contemporaines/societe-et-immigration/a-quel-type-de-logement-les-immigres-accedent-ils). Près de la moitié n'est même pas foutue de se payer un logement et tu voudrais qu'ils paient pour des retraites ?

Mais bon pour quelqu'un qui a plus de 65 de QI une règle de trois ça à l'air bien compliqué à faire.

&gt;Pendant les 30 prochaines années, les babyboomers vont partir à la retraite et il n'y aura personne pour payer les retraites

Il faudrait peut-être qu'il y ait de l'emploi pour commencer. On a 6 millions de chômeurs ça a dû t'échapper. Avec quels emplois ils paient nos retraites alors gros malin ?

&gt;Selon les Nations unies, en l'absence de migrations, dans les cinquante ans à venir, l'Union européenne verrait sa population diminuer de 43 millions

Sauf qu'en France on a assez de naissances donc ça ne s'applique pas du tout à notre pays.

If this fails check online like on the french yellow pages ""pages jaunes"" for jewish places. A synagogue in french is called... a synagogue.
Then email them for advice. 
I bet they will reassure you. If they don't which I strongly doubt you'll make your decision based on informed advice. 
You should realise your view is skewed by the fear mongering attitude of the US media.  
Parisian jews aren't fleeing to Israël or NY.

&gt;Comme je comprend qu'il faut vraiment pas avoir de vie ni beaucoup d'introspection pour reporter continuellement ses problèmes sur une certaine minorité ou 2 dans ton cas

Je ne reporte pas mes problèmes, je te démontre que ce que tu dis est complètement faux.

Les immigrés coûtent de l'argent et ne paient absolument pas les retraites.

The basic grammar of the language just sort of sunk in with exposure so there doesn't seem to be much gain for me in creating cards for them. I do toy with the idea of adding cards for some of the subtler points but having to find example sentences that would cover all of the edge cases without giving away the answer always seems more difficult than it is worth.

To give an example, let's say I wanted to learn which case ""wegen"" governs. The answer is that it is the genitive in highly formal German and the dative otherwise. I'd be tempted to make a card that says something like ""Ich bleibe zuhause wegen ___  Hitze."" The first problem is that if I use a feminine noun like this, my answer is the same whether I think the correct case is genitive or dative, so I have to stick to masculine or neuter nouns. I could change ""Hitze"" to ""Wetter[s]"", though I don't really know what to do with the gentive S. If I add a blank for it, that's giving information away.

Similarly, there's the problem that the answer depends on the formal register. I could add make two cards, one asking for the colloquial answer and one asking for the formal answer but the only prepositions that information is relevant to are the genitive ones (I believe). So unless I make two of every other preposition card, the fact that this information is on the card gives the answer away.

I don't think that grammar cards are a bad idea in principle but I have yet to think of a good solution to these problems, so if you have any suggestions I'd be interested to hear them. For the most part, I just focus on learning vocabulary in context (I put full sentences on my Anki cards but I highlight the one word I am trying to learn) and that does seem to help me remember the basic grammar as well. The other thing I make sure to do is to create cards for the gender and plural of nouns as well as the principal parts of verbs.",0,1419056013,null,0,false,0,cn0anh2,t3_2przo1,t1_cn0anh2,t1_cmzhp3n,null,1425305579,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

I know that. Still, most European nations do not operate along  the melting pot model. France, Sweden, the UK do. Germany (as an example), in my opinion, does not.

&gt; We have a Korean minister who speaks French

Fleur Pellerin has nothing to do with Korea. She was adopted by a French family when she was 5, does not speak a word of Korean and hasn't been in Korea ever since she was adopted. In my opinion she's French and nothing more. You could say she's ethnically Korean though.

&gt; there are socioeconomic problems related to these immigrants of different ethnicities but they are no different than the problems faced in the United States.

The US has long been the example of failure if your goal is to minimise unrest, ghettos and so on. At least that's the way most Europeans see it.

I want no European nation to have 90% immigrants among its convicts/prisoners. Accepting the problems we face now as inherent to mass migration-accepting policies is unacceptable and if that is truly the case those policies must be stopped immediately. I don't think that is the case though, and without going full ""it's our fault for sucking at integration"", which some leftists seem to consider a valid argument, I think we can do better without drastically cutting immigration.

&gt; I think it's basically it's not that Islam is incompatible with ""Western European culture"", but it's mainly that certain sects of Islam are incompatible with Western culture. Look at Shi'ites and Sufis. They are more integrated in Europe than certain Sunni Muslims.

I agree on that, Sunni Islam is a plague, especially since the Gulf state-funded rise of Wahhabism. However, I can't say if that is due to Shia Islam's prevalence in mostly westernised countries (the main one being Iran), their historical status as oppressed religious minorities or truly due to some fundamental ideological difference in Shiism.",0,1419056379,null,0,false,0,cn0armi,t3_2psu7r,t1_cn0armi,t1_cn09ywv,null,1425305526,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

This one is provably wrong. Just look at historical inflation rates of  Italy, Greece, India. Hell even the US and UK in the late 70s early 80s. All countries borrowing in their own currency with high inflation rates because they were trying to print their way out of it. A famous overused example is the weimar republic.  

The US and UK and even the Euro today I believe are anomalies. Partly because they are reserve currencies and people don't have much choice. Partly because a lot of what they are printing *is not being lent out into the market.* It's just sitting in digital vaults so it's mostly just a game to restore trust in banks after the crisis. Most important of all I believe is a trust in these central banks that they will in the future pull back the money they printed before it gets inflationary. 

For the first point I don't mean the government 'forces' people to save. But they can influence where those savings go and how much they'll save by providing a large convenient pit in which those saving can go. Banks like government bonds. Both governments and banks are big so they like working with each other. So it makes sense that when governments start issuing large amounts of bonds (especially during a crisis), banks will prefer that over investing anywhere else.

Are you able to provide me a source that inflation was caused in any of these due to governments printing their own free floating currency to pay back debt denominated in their own free floating currency?

&gt;Hell even the US and UK in the late 70s early 80s.

Oil price shock. Price of oil went up 4x, prices of everything increased as a response. Surprise level 0. Google ""OPEC oil crisis"".

&gt;A famous overused example is the weimar republic.  

An overused and incorrect example. Weimar owed *gold*. Weimar could not print gold, so they printed paper trying to buy gold. Not surprisingly the currency crashed as a result. Zimbabwe was the same, only with USD in place of gold.

&gt;It's just sitting in digital vaults so it's mostly just a game to restore trust in banks after the crisis.

Common misconception, banks don't lend out their reserves and so bolstering reserves would never increase lending beyond its impact on interest rates. Google ""money is an IOU""/guardian article and associated Bank of England paper,  and/or endogenous money.

&gt;Most important of all I believe is a trust in these central banks that they will in the future pull back the money they printed before it gets inflationary.

Reserves will never become inflationary for they don't directly lead to more lending.

Pros

* Free even without having money
* Referral system that offers free money
* ""Wechselgeldsparen"" - when using the credit card you gain 100% in the first 3 months (10% after that) on the difference between the paid amount and the next higher even amount. Eg: You pay 1.60€ and get 0.40€ (0.04€ after 3 months) back.
* Free instant access savings account ²

Cons

* There are not that many places where you can withdraw money for free. 
* No local affiliates. You need to send checks via mail.
* [Charges for a lot of things](http://www.comdirect.de/pbl/member/formcenter/download/f_pl_4_1014.pdf?redirected=115830&amp;ePdfInstance=618761&amp;ePageId=cori7105&amp;pdf=&amp;name=&amp;combined=true).

Commodity prices can never cause long term inflation as that's a function of the amount of money in circulation. If the oil shocks caused the inflation it would have reversed when the shocks ended. It didn't. Also the inflation started before the shock. And oil prices increased *in real terms* during the shock. And reduced in real terms after it. Overall prices did not go back at all. The long term part of the inflation had nothing to do with oil prices. I was wrong about weimar so I apologize. For the other countries (and numerous other examples where governments had to print money, wars, recessions, or just bad policy) I'm sure you can google for data. Heres a paper on [india] (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1851131) but I'm sure you'l find more. 

But to go back to your earlier point, I don't understand how you can claim that printing money to pay domestic denominated debt will not add to inflation while foreign denominated debt will. Wheres the logic in that? The only difference I can see is that they would need to print more in the former. 

Also it's not like the government can jut print money, hand it over to the debtor and be done with it. They can only borrow from the central bank and the borrowed money has to be payed back.

I'm not really sure why we are discussing how much attention ukip should get on this thread. Clearly both you and I agree that ukip is a topic that is worthy of discussion, otherwise we wouldn't discuss them. Personally my starting point is that there is no such thing as deserved attention. In a world of a free and plural media it really is entirely up to the media which topics they want to cover. Also, political weight is not the sole reason for deciding whether or not to cover something: other factors are relevant too, for example historical significance or novelty. British electoral history has been remarkably boring: prior to ukip's win in the EU elections, in the previous 100 years of UK election history no party other than the conservatives or labour won a UK wide election. That event is therefore historically significant. Also, please don't describe me as a ukip apologist. This really isn't how I would like to be described.

&gt;Moderators are there to keep people on topic and make sure the discussion continues according to the question. She was evading it by claiming the media were out to get UKIP, which is demonstrably false.

As already mentioned, the moderator did not bring the MEP back on to the question of the audience. He seemed to be much more interested in his own questions and did not give the MEP the chance to answer them. That's regrettable.

2)[Romania is the fastest growing economy in Europe](http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2013/12/what-britain-forgets) and is projected to grow even more in 2015, even despite our incompetent socialist government and brain drain. Which brings me to..

3) Indeed, not much of the Romanian emmigration is sustained by capital and investment, but a very very [large portion is comprised of higher educated European citizen.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/03/romanian-bulglarian-uk-immigration-hysteria-far-right).

I don't know the situation in Scandinavia as well the one in Western EU; but just because you had some shitty experiences with gypos shouldn't be enough to turn you racist.

In fact Romania has a lower crime rate than Sweden. Maybe you should watch out for African and Middle Eastern immigrants, instead of Romanians, Bulgarians and Turks. Maybe, just maybe, rape, beheadings and honor killings are a little worse than gypos taking ye'r jobs and begging in parking lots. 

You don't pay for the care of the poor Romanians, you probably pay for your fellow marxist students to smoke weed all day and drive your unemployment rate up. Because, let's be honest, who's going to work when you can gorge on those kinds of benefits ?

And finally, be thankful that the US and UK spent their treasury for 50 years on outrageous defense budgets to protect and rebuild Western Europe and democratic interests (not so much Sweden, but definitely the case in Norway, France and Germany).

We're basically just a drain on their super unpopular aforementioned defense budgets. If trade doesn't become lax, there might be a real rift across the Atlantic. 

And lastly, no, I'm not rich. I work for 300$ a month to pay for my schooling. I don't expect handouts of 1500$ like you just to sit on my pale blonde ass and be outraged because this month's handout is 1498$. Because of those damned Romanians, of course.

false,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"&gt; Cataluña is not another nation just because it has another language. If in the UN there's 193 nations in the world and thousands of languages, are there thousands of nations missing on the UN

First off, nation =! state and nation =! country

In the UN there are 193 states, not nations. You're right only in the sense that just having a different language does not mean you need to be another independent state. 

However, Catalans are a nation. A nation is group of people with a common culture, traditions, history **and** language (sometimes, but not always, ethnicity as well), who relate to the same territory and to one another. Following this definition, Catalonia is a nation. It is NOT a state, but that's quite a different thing. This *does not* mean Catalonia is less part of Spain or that Catalans aren't Spaniards (at least for now). They are, but that's not incompatible with them being a nation.

&gt;And Spain is not precisely more multilingual than others

I don't think anyone said it was.

&gt;And, if one language equals one nation, do the Aranese belong to the Catalonian nation?

That's up to the Aranese for decide. They could identify with both the Occitan culture and the Catalan culture, or just to one, just like there are Catalans, Galicians and Basques who identify to both their local cultures and the Spanish one.

&gt; Finally, why from the existence of a language do political consequences have to be inferred?

The existence of a language has cultural consequences, not political. I repeat again, a nation is not the same thing a state or a country. Catalonia is a nation, it is not a state and not a country.

I do think it's very important, and I do think social cohesion was damaged in a lot of countries by the **global financial crisis** far more than it was damaged by immigration and we all know who is responsible for that. 

My point is that blaming problems on immigration is easy, because immigrants are the most vulnerable members of society, but in reality
the main trouble makers are really on the high street.

Again, the UK population in 1960 was 52 million. Currently it's around 64 million. That's a 23% increase over a period of 54 years.

Standard shopping hours in Spain/Madrid. Three years ago a law was approved giving freedom to shops to open whenever they want, but most of them stay with the original hours.

Prices far more readily move *upwards* than decrease. It's for this reason that the South's wages didn't just readily decrease such that they never really varied from full employment, rather the crisis has been going for years and years and years so much so that they're mostly hanging on for *relative disinflation*.

&gt;The long term part of the inflation had nothing to do with oil prices.

There was an extended period of markets trying to find who was going to bear the falling standard of living. In real terms, oil became a lot more scarce. Prices are how we find who's going to be able to consume. A lot of people went to their employers asking for wage increases to maintain standards of living, it took quite some time for that to settle.

One thing that *did* help the process was the Fed (and other central banks) eventually lifting interest rates. This *forced* many to consume less. An increase in taxation or a cut in government spending would have done largely the same. Instead the governments of the day were addressing the crisis as a lack of demand when it was actually a supply side shock - they were doing the opposite of what they should have been doing.

&gt; Heres a paper on india[1] but I'm sure you'l find more.

Nothing in that says that governments were increasing the money supply to pay back domestically denominated debts.

Look at countries with high domestic denominated debts. The UK. Japan. The US. All three of these are struggling with *too low* inflation today.

If high domestically denominated debt meant inflation, Japan would be showing up Weimar right now in their rates of inflation. They're not.

&gt;But to go back to your earlier point, I don't understand how you can claim that printing money to pay domestic denominated debt will not add to inflation while foreign denominated debt will. Wheres the logic in that?

It's actually easy to see.

Consider the three ways a government can fund a $1mn deficit. It can:

1. Spend $1mn from a vault of previously ""saved"" currency. This increases the non-govts wealth by exactly $1mn, they have $1mn more that they can spend that they did not have before. As far as they're concerned, $1mn went into a paper shredder some years ago.. and now a printer's just printed $1mn of fresh new currency for them to spend.

2. Print $1mn worth of new currency. Ditto all of the above, only now without the earlier paper shredding.

3. Print $1mn worth of bonds. This is the normal convention today. The government prints $1mn worth of high valued very liquid financial assets, so much like cash they're literally called [cash equivalents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalents), and spends them into existence. The non-govt receives these bonds, and is now $1mn richer for it. They have $1mn more worth of very liquid financial assets than they did before the deficit.

Now the important thing to realise is that whether you own $1mn worth of bonds or worth of cash your net worth *is identical*. You're a very wealthy individual. You can trade either for a $1mn house very easily. You can turn that $1mn into cash, or that cash into bonds, very easily - back and forth, back and forth. They're one of the most liquid financial assets in existence after all.

Now what's QE? QE is swapping bonds for cash. It's turning an ex (3) funded deficit into a (2) funded deficit. It's making no one wealthier, beyond the extent to which it bids up the price of those very financial assets, and the effect it has on interest rates. The important thing to realise though is that those financial assets have a ceiling in price - par value/face value. Similarly there's a floor to interest rates - zero. (You can in theory tax reserves to introduce negative interest rates, but it doesn't change much at all here).

So anyway. That's domestic debt. When the government spends domestic money into existence, it can choose to either print bonds, or print currency to fund it. And down the road, it can retrospectively change how it was funded. Beyond the change in interest rates doing so has, not much changes financially, and there's a limit to the extent that'll happen (the zero lower bound).

Foreign debt though is different. When the government tries to buy up foreign currencies to repay it, there's literally no floor on the value of their own currency. They can find they've bought up the whole supply curve of USD on fx markets and still not come close to paying back their debt. Should they try this, and many have (Argentina/Weimar/Zimbabwe), every other person dependant on international trade/fx will also find they can't buy USD or any other currency for a reasonable rate.

Also, critically, the act of devaluing the currency in this manner leads to a new flow of your own currency. Remember QE? It turned someone's $1mn worth of bonds into $1mn worth of cash. They weren't left any wealthier. Buying up fx though.. that's different. You start off paying 1:1, but as you're buying up the supply curve you soon end up at 5:1, 10:1, 1000:1. You're making everyone wealthier and wealthier, in terms of your currency, as you go. They'll be sure to place demand with their newfound wealth on your domestic economy, and the ensuing/massively increased demand will result in *everyone* having to put up prices and pay more for goods. Hyperinflation.

false,Beck2012,POLA,Kraków/Zakopane,"You're writing about poachers, not hunters. Hunters are guys that maintain and protect wildlife - there is very little shooting in being a hunter, but a lo of feeding animals and checking their health. 

If it wasn't for hunters, there would be no visents alive. And there would be plenty more visents, if not for Germans, who in 1940s almost wiped them out. But I remember from few years ago, there was a disease among visents in Bieszczady, so hunters came in and killed the sick animals. If they didn't do this, there would be far more dead visents.

My point is - there is no way to restore population of any wild mammal in Europe, without hunters. One disease, or one year with overpopulation in certain region, and all efforts of conservationists are gone. Population of wild animals must be controlled, because there are several places in Europe where those wild animals live and they're not connected - it's not Siberia, where animals have thousands of kilometers to roam freely.

The next thing is - animals ARE dangerous. In late autumn I try not to stay in some parts of my town around midnight. Because of bears. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OClLRk5IBo) is footage from few hundred meters from my house.

But wolves might be dangerous, they've killed 60 people in Bihar in years 1993-1995, that's a lot.

I said *Romanian* beggars and not Gypsy beggars. Gypsies rarely even see themselves as belonging to the countries they inhibit and I think it's unfair to them to call them anything they don't want to be called. It is Romanians and not gypsies coming here from Romania. I'm not bullshitting you.

Racism means judging someone for their ethnicity, religion, language, etc. It's not racism when I say you are a Romanian full of shit. If I said you're full of shit because you're Romanian it's racsim.

I agree, other things also impact social cohesion. However, that would be a reason to address those things. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't consider the impact that immigration has on social cohesion.

&gt;My point is that blaming problems on immigration is easy, because immigrants are the most vulnerable members of society, but in reality the main trouble makers are really on the high street.

I think it should be very clear from my posts that I am not blaming problems on immigration.

As already mentioned, I am blaming the failures of UK infrastructure on the UK government.

These changes appear because there has been  a genetic modification, which you ""select"" much like natural selection would, but they occur because the DNA is targetted, it's not like they appear just out of goodwill.

Bear in mind, genetic modifications can work in many different ways, you don't necessarily go and add a new gene (transgene), you can just enhance or lower its expression, but in any case any modification passes through the DNA. Basically, genetic engineering and traditional methods are the same as engineering a building from the beginning and throwing rocks on top of the other waiting for a building to be erected.

What's the matter with artificial fecondation? It's not genetic engineering, nobody ever said that.

Yes, they would be a ""natural"" predator for some species that now have to be population-controled, but the ""natural"" remains in quotation marks since the re-introduction is also a designed human intervention.

And to what purpose? Now the hunters have to control the boar populations because they would wildly oscillate if left alone. Afterwards, they would have to control both the wulf and boar populations for the same reasons, because just adding one more predator to the system won't make it more stable.

false,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"Are you asking why the moon is masculine and the sun feminine, when in other languages it's the other way around?

Nobody knows for sure.

The word for ""sun"" was feminine in the proto-Germanic language, a now lost language that was being spoken about 2,000 years ago, even though it is probably directly related to the Latin ""sol"" which is masculine.

Similarly, the word for ""moon"" was masculine in proto-Germanic, but in Middle High German (11th to 14th centuries) could be either masculine or feminine -- in modern German it's settled down and is now definitely masculine. But the word is related to ""month"" (the period between two new moons is one month... roughly), and in Latin-based languages like French, although the word for ""moon"" is feminine (""la lune"" in French, ""la luna"" in Spanish), the word for ""month"" is masculine (""le mois"" in French, ""el mes"" in Spanish). The same is true for the Slavic languages, like Russian: ""moon"" in Russian is ""luna"", feminine, while ""month"" is ""mesyats"", masculine.

Why do grammatical genders exist at all? Nobody really knows, but the usual theory is that people just categorize nouns depending on... well, something, anything, whatever that may be. Non-European languages have different ways of categorizing things, such as by shape (so ""long and thin"" is one ""gender"", and ""round or egg-shaped"" is another, for example). European languages have two or three genders, and just happen to categorize females one way (which we then call ""feminine"") and males another way (which we then call ""masculine""), and if there's a third gender we call it ""neuter"". So, ""Mond"" isn't necessarly a male thing, but a thing that belongs in the same category as men, boys, bulls, stallions and so on.",0,1419073453,null,0,false,0,cn0edro,t3_2puezo,t1_cn0edro,t3_2puezo,null,1425303773,6,false,German,t5_2qq51,6

Leur implication est très importante, elle remonte à DADVSI et a eu des effets majeurs en Europe. Ils ont mené plusieurs actions en justice et ont fait du lobbying auprès des différents parlements impliqués. 

Mais le problème de la quadrature est qu'ils fonctionnent comme un  lobby sans avoir le financement d'un lobby. C'est-à-dire que la base *corporate* de leurs financements est relativement étroite et ils font beaucoup appel aux dons des particuliers. 

Seulement leurs actions présentent deux barrières pour ceux qui souhaitent s'y intéresser : elles sont très juridiques, surtout au niveau européen et elles développent des arguments techniques. Elles sont donc vraiment peu visibles. Pendant HADOPI la quadrature avait mené des actions plus médiatiques et percé dans le grand public (ils ont inauguré le *blackout* de sites Internet, méthode ensuite largement reprise à l'international). Malheureusement depuis leur communication a à mon sens perdu de son efficacité. Ils ont abandonné leur page facebook parce que le site est une atteinte à la vie privée (ce qui est vrai, mais EFF par exemple réussit très bien à communiquer contre Facebook sur Facebook), Jérémie Zimmermann qui avait été très présent sur les médias pendant un temps a largement disparu, leur site ne présente que peu de contenus accessibles au grand public, etc. 

Enfin c'est une remarque personnelle mais je note qu'ils manquent un peu de véritables juristes et notamment de fiscalistes. J'avais parlé avec un employé de LQDN qui me disait qu'ils n'avaient je crois pas pu être déclarés d'utilité publique et avaient donc été largement fiscalisés.

false,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how ISDS works. I wrote a post about it a while back which I'll shameless quote here.

The EU already has [ISDS provisions in over 1400 of their investment and trade agreements](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/march/tradoc_152279.pdf), and is the most prolific user of them globally. Regardless, ISDS is nowhere near as bad as commonly reported. 

Most instances of ISDS are pretty reasonable, and even the Phillip Morris one has some backing (tobacco company suing Australia over plain packaging of cigarettes). They're not claiming lost profits or anything as the cause for the suing (that's what they want in damages), rather they claim that the government expropriated without compensation their intellectual property - their trademark, brand name, brand associated goodwill, etc. I'm sceptical they'll win, but they have a case to make, and regardless I don't think they even intend to win - rather, whilst Australia is bogged down in negotiations, other countries will refrain from implementing plain packaging themselves (Ireland, for example, appears to be waiting on the verdict before implementing their version of the law). They probably did some cost analysis which determined they'd lose less money on lawyers (and the settlement against them) than they would if other countries implemented plain packaging sooner.

Regardless, in most cases that ISDS is undertaken it's not nearly as egregiously against the public interest as the Philip Morris case. Pretty much all successful ISDS cases are when the government takes political decisions which disproportionately disfavour foreign companies. For example, an early use of ISDS was when Canada banned a fuel additive that was only used by one company (foreign) called Ethyl Corp on the basis of health reasons. Ethyl Corp sued, saying the additive was actually banned for political reasons rather than on any scientific grounds, and the Canadian government settled paying them some $20 million dollars and withdrawing the law they were implementing.

On the face of it, it seems like Ethyl Corp was the bad guy and the Canadian government was pursuing legitimate policy in the public interest. In actual fact, [Ethyl Corp presented the Canadian governments own documents](http://www.economia-snci.gob.mx/sic_php/pages/importa/sol_contro/consultoria/Casos_canada/Ethyl/971002_Statement_of_Claim.pdf) (p.4 onwards), coming from the Health and Environmental departments, dating to about a year prior that unequivocally stated that there was absolutely zero danger from using the additive in fuel. In fact, the party that tried to get the law through had had strong historical links with the domestic companies competing with Ethyl Corp.

In all the papers, it was portrayed as 'Company sues government over environmental protections/health protections', and that's how all ISDS cases get presented in mainstream newspapers. 'Company screwing with our laws' sells way more papers than 'company disputes unfair government policies', I guess. I don't know about you, but I don't think it's fair that foreign investors should be unfairly discriminated against in this way. ISDS prevents political parties from favouring their contributors over foreigners by enacting biased laws such as these. Why should Joe Public lose out because one of the parties is trying to cozy up to their largest donors, and why is it fair that international investors get screwed just because they're foreigners?

Even the Vattenfall nuclear case is a fair point of them suing. Germany did the comprehensive shut down and testing, and none of the reports recommended accelerating the nuclear shut down, yet the German government did it anyway. Why is it fair that the government can make companies (and hence people, their shareholders) lose money just because something is 'popular'. Is Germany a country run by the tyranny of the majority, or is it a liberal-democracy that has safeguards in place to ensure weaker parties cannot be unfairly targeted? Yes, the whole thing was popular (hence why Merkel did an about-face and made the changes, she knew it would be a strong political issue for the rest of her term, probably one which could cost her the next election). But do we really want to let politics dictate who wins and who loses, or should we have a fair playing field?

Regardless, modern negotiators have recognized some of the flaws demonstrated by the Phillip Morris case, which is why the EU negotiations for the TTIP have added to their [negotiating mandate the following text (on ISDS)](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11103-2013-DCL-1/en/pdf) (p. 8)

&gt;and should be without prejudice to the right of the EU and the Member States to adopt and enforce, in accordance with their respective competences, measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner

So it's not if they can sue because they don't have unhindered profit. That's ridiculous, and no government would ever agree to that. They can sue when government either expropriate their assets without fair compensation, or the government acts in a discriminatory fashion to foreign companies, or when the government acts 'in bad faith' against a foreign company. Regardless, that only allows them to sue and doesn't necessarily mean they'll win, and they can only sue for financial compensation - they can't force a country to change laws.",0,1419074209,null,0,false,0,cn0ehxs,t3_2pu5h1,t1_cn0ehxs,t1_cn0ecb5,null,1425303715,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Usually bears are more of a problem in that they want to get into everything, and they're strong and smart enough that it's tough to keep them out.

It is true that bears and wolves kill humans, but it wouldn't be my top concern.

false,JackBond1234,null,null,"I'm not even a year in, but here's what I understand thus far.

Every noun has one of three genders, masculine, neuter, or feminine. When it comes to composing sentences, you might as well include *plural* as a gender as well. A word may have its own gender, but if you refer to it in plural, this will override the gender.

You'll usually start by learning these cases in the Nominative Case. That is, Masculine corresponds to ""Der"", Neuter to ""Das"", Feminine to ""Die"", and Plural to ""Die"". I'll explain what Nominative is in a moment.

The real struggle with learning German is figuring out the gender of any given noun. Unfortunately there's rarely any rhyme or reason to it. In many cases, words with explicit genders like *man* or *woman* correspond to the expected gender. But not always. For example, the word for *girl*, ""mädchen"" is neuter. For each noun you learn, you will want to learn the gender alongside it.

To make it a little bit harder, depending on which of the four cases your noun appears in, the way you denote the gender of your noun changes.

* The Nominative case is mainly used for the subjects of a sentence ""The **subject** gave the receiver the object."" Depending on whatever word you use for ""subject"", the article ""the"" may be translated as der, das, die, or die. Note also that if you have a sentence like ""He is the man"", the word ""man"" is still in the Nominative case, even though it is not necessarily the subject. Statements of being are Nominative.

* The Genitive case, I'm afraid I can't help much with, as I haven't gone over them much in my studies. From what I understand, they deal with possessives, but I haven't really seen this case used before. What I do know is that the article ""the"" is translated as des, der, des, or der.

* The Dative case is often used when you're talking about an indirect object, or an object of a preposition. For instance ""The subject gave the **receiver** the object."" or for a prepositional phrase, ""He went to the **store**."" In this case, your translations for ""the"" would be dem, der, dem, or den.

* Lastly the Accusive case is mostly used when you're talking about a direct object, aka the object immediately being acted upon. For example ""The subject gave the receiver the **object**."" And the translations for ""the"" would be den, die, das, or die.

All this really does just take memorization, but it really helped me to study the charts of the different forms and maybe make mnemonics for them. For instance, it helps me to remember the last letter of each gender word and make words out of those:

| |Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural
|-|---------|--------|------|------
Nom | r | e | s | e
Gen | s | r | s | r
Dat | m | r | m | n
Acc | n | e | s | e

So you can remember Nom with ""Reese's cups"", Gen with ""Sir! Sir!"", Dat with ""Merman"", and Acc with ""Niece""... but with an s.

Okay so the mnemonics are a little silly, but they helped me remember.

When it comes to figuring out / memorizing all this stuff, [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_declension) is an EXTREMELY useful reference. It has all of the gender forms for all of the cases, and even more, like the gender forms you'll have to tack onto adjectives and their three different inflections.

Sorry for the text wall, but I find this stuff very fascinating. Don't be too overwhelmed by all this stuff to remember. It doesn't all come at once, but if you have good lessons, it shouldn't be frustrating. It'll all come in time.

&gt;__German declension__ is the paradigm that [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) uses to define all the ways articles, adjectives and sometimes nouns can change their form to reflect their role in the sentence: subject, object, etc. [Declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension) allows speakers to mark a difference between subjects, direct objects, indirect objects and possessives by changing the form of the word—and/or its associated article—instead of indicating this meaning through word order or prepositions (e.g. [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language)). As a result, German can take a much more fluid approach to word order without the meaning being obscured. In English, a simple sentence must be written in strict word order (ex. John sees Mary). This sentence cannot be expressed in any other word order than how it is written here without substituting one word with a synonym. A transliteration of the same sentence from German to English would appear rather different (ex. John-subject sees Mary-directobject) and can be expressed with a variety of word order (ex. Mary-directobject sees John-subject) with little or no change in meaning.

false,maripool,null,null,"&gt;Das mag ja bei dir so sein, aber ich zum Beispiel habe in meinem Heimatland noch rechtliche Ansprüche gegen die (vormals kommunistische) Regierung – aber nur als dortiger Staatsangehöriger.

Prima. Würde ich auch so machen wollen wie du. Aber Sauerei, dass du in deinem ehemaligen Staat alte Ansprüche verlierst, nur weil du den Pass wechselst. 

Damit bläst du doch in mein Horn. Es geht bei dem Thema für mich um viele rechtliche Vorteile und nicht um das emotionale ""es fördert die Integration, wenn man Einwanderern mehrere Pässe lässt, damit sie sich überall heimlich fühlen können"", was oft von Politikern ausgegeben wird. 

&gt;Wenn sie den Heimatpass abgeben, verlieren sie gewisse Rechte, die jemand, dessen Lebensmittelpunkte alle in einem Land liegen, eben nicht abgeben muss.

Lebensmittelpunkt in mehreren Staaten? Wie sieht das konkret aus, zb bei dir? Und nein, in der vorigen Heimat noch die Oma wohnen haben, dort ein paar Immobilien besitzen und Sommer- sowie Weihnachtsurlaub dort verbringen ist für mich noch kein Lebensmittelpunkt. 

Hier geht es ja vor allem um türkische Migranten, die oft hier geboren und aufgewachsen sind. Ich erlebe da nur selten einen Lebensmittelpunkt in der Türkei.

We couldn't possibl*y* know if the MP and his colleagues stopped at cutting and pasting the sound over the video.

It is remarkable that the leftist opposition joined the government MPs, agreeing that the video is the product of interception and that the original material has been tampered with.

The MP first accused the PM of being behind it all but then changed his tune, saying that it was the alleged briber mentioning the PM and a friend of his. Apparently the MP now doesn't accuse the PM and the government. Legal action might have helped in restoring some sense of sanity. In addition to that, he said that the alleged briber still owed him money after failing to return most of the capital the MP gave him to invest abroad.

I'm now putting my money in this scenario: the alleged briber couldn't pay back the MP, he did what he did to blackmail him later, the party tried to turn the tables by changing the narrative, hoping that everything would be lost during the electoral mess.

È uno sconosciuto che entra nella tua vita e a cui probabilmente non hai voglia di raccontare i tuoi segreti, la tua intimità. A meno che lui sia particolarmente bravo a farti sentire a tuo agio, ad ogni modo anche in quel caso faticherai ad aprirti completamente. Inoltre tenderai a modificare la realtà: acuire i sintomi se vorresti sentirti dire che sei malato, o ridurli se invece vorresti sentirti dire che sei perfettamente ok. Poi se lui è abbastanza bravo può arrivare a risultati diagnostici precisi anche senza che tu gli dica esattamente tutti i tuoi pensieri. Lui cercherà di metterti alla prova facendoti le stesse domande in tantissimi modi diversi, e capirà l'affidabilità delle tue risposte sulla base della tua coerenza. 

Non dico di non andare dallo psicologo, eh, dico che a volte confrontarsi con un amico intimo o persino degli sconosciuti può aiutare molto. Con gli sconosciuti c'è sempre la paura di essere giudicati male, la barriera esiste comunque, ma spesso si riesce a romperla con il fatto che non c'è contatto diretto con l'interlocutore e, qui su reddit, si può nascondere l'identità dietro un nick.

Yes, the point is that when new countries become members of the EU those countries are often less developed and as such integrating the union even further becomes difficult. It's much more simple to create a single political entity between countries that are similar to each other in development and wealth. This is also why the UK is the biggest advocate of Turkish membership of the union. They know that if Turkey becomes a member then the rest of Europe are not going to be very keen on handing more power to the EU. 

The EU is hardly socialist, by the way. Its policies are neo-liberal and the current Commission is headed by one of the worst right wing capitalists. There is a lot of scepticism on the center-left in Europe because of the austerity approach that the EU has taken.

false,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"People the majority population treated abhorrently over centuries. People with their own culture that's worth a fuckton that are currently in a situation that if the majority population experienced it, you'd behave similarly.

With such much distrust shown, why would they trust you without you giving them a hell of a reason. Why. Tell me.

People with a culture they want to *keep*. Which, as autochtonous people, they have a bloody right to. Because yes they're a proud people. Which they also have a right to. They're also a freedom-loving people. You can't just tell them to do whatever or tell them they have to change on your terms. But improving their situation still works, if you go about it the right way:

We've got e.g. Maro Temm, here. A settlement that if it weren't for a caravan in front of every house, you would confuse with any other one, on a quick look. On second look it's slightly away from things so that parties don't disturb neighbours (though those do come over), and on further look you see, yes, it's full of Sinti.  Most of the adults living there live off benefits, their kids? Going to school, doing not bad at all, considering that their parents are analphabetic. Took two years of building respect and understanding each other to make that regular, but by now you can consider it stable. Sinti don't like to tell their kids what to do (Inuit, e.g., don't, either), a cultural norm, expectancy, had to be built, elders had to look dissaprovingly first at that board on the wall that tracks school attendance, then on individual parents. But it worked out. Those kids are going places.

How successful the project will be, in the end, will depend on what the kids are doing as a whole: Are they going to stay in the clan, or are they going to leave, in effect ceasing to be Sinti in everything but ancestry? With their educational success, they'd have that possibility.

Because if they don't leave and thus ensure the clan as such survives to the next generation, but are way better off materially, all our other Sinti will want to have that programme, too.",0,1419079444,null,0,false,0,cn0fcuc,t3_2ps0it,t1_cn0fcuc,t1_cn04dbt,null,1425303314,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

I don't think that whoever pieces together a scenario someone else doesn't agree with does it to support the Greek government, and that those arguing against this scenario do it to support the Greek government's detractors.

&gt; The fact that they couldn't catch him red-handed does not mean the bribery attempt was not real.

There was an incident but we don't know if that incident was a real bribery attempt. The MP and his party present it as such. The MP repeatedly refused to tell the name of the alleged briber to the prosecutor. This triggers an alarm for me.

&gt; The fact that the ethics committee decided not to make the recordings public does not mean that there is nothing to see here (if anything, it suggests the opposite)

Τhe fact that the opposition agreed with the government after what we've learned today could suggest the opposite of what you think.

&gt; You're connecting two very different incidents without any proof.

I take it that we're not going to have a discussion about flying teapots! Look, nobody has definite proof about anything. But some things are a stretch and some others aren't. As time goes by it looks worse for the bribery scenario.

&gt; But the story is much bigger than that.

This can go either way, some politicians might have a stake in making the story appearing bigger than what it really is. Those crying foul don't seem very credible to begin with.

Ein Sanktionsregime ist doch im Grunde genommen ein Anreizsystem. Hängen wir es an der Krim auf: In diesem Fall wird anerkannt, dass die Annexion der Krim für die russische Regierung einen gewissen politischen Nutzen hat. Als Reaktion werden Sanktionen verhängt, die diesen Nutzen ausgleichen oder ins Gegenteil verkehren sollen, damit die rus. Regierung ihren Kurs ändert. Gemessen an öffentlichen Verkundbarungen funktioniert dies nicht, weil die rus. Regierung glaubt, sie könne die Sanktionen aussitzen, siehe: http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russia-dismisses-us-sanctions-useless-27733387

Das ist ein Problem, das man in abgewandelter Form aus der Wirtschaftspolitik kennt: Der Effekt eines wie auch immer gearteten Konjunkturprogrammes verpufft, wenn derjenige, der es auflegt, nicht glaubhaft machen kann, dass es zu einer nachhaltigen Verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen Lage führen wird. Denn kann er das nicht, wird durch das Programm zusätzlich erzieltes Einkommen für die Zeit des erwarteten Abschwungs auf die hohe Kante gelegt.

Und warum glaubt sie das? Weil sie um die Verflechtungen zwischen ihrer eigenen und den europäischen Wirtschaften, die gegenwärtige Verwundbarkeit der eur. Wirtschaften und die Anfälligkeit eur. Politiker für wirtschaftliche Probleme weiß und daraus schließt, dass die Europäer es nicht zulassen werden, dass der Kollaps der rus. Wirtschaft sie mit in den Abgrund reißt.

Wenn man diesen Artikel liest, könnte man auf den Gedanken kommen, sie hätten recht. Es besteht also ein Mangel an Glaubwürdigkeit.

Crimea was part of Russia between XI and XII centuries. And Tatars never held the majority on the Peninsula, like Goths never held majority in France, Spain or Italy, and Brits in England. 

The majority was always Greeks until more or less XV when Greek slaves started to be substituted by slaves of Slavonic origin. 

By the time Potemkin took Crimea in in 1784 Slavonics (Russians, Ukrainians and Poles) were the majority for a couple of centuries, most of them were in state of slavery or serfdom to the Tatars.

For a couple of years after that it was unclear who had the majority - because most of the slaves returned to their lands but also the slavers mostly flew to the Ottoman empire because of the persecution. 

After those years - many colonists arrived from mainland (Russians and Ukrainians, many of them liberated slaves) and after that Tatars already were a minority. And has nothing to do with XX century mass-deportation, as you can see in historical documents, like the first imperial census of 1897 in which we can see that Tatars were only 12% of the total population.",0,1419082735,null,0,false,0,cn0g0kq,t3_2pvorq,t1_cn0g0kq,t1_cn0fdl0,null,1425303007,-24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-24

Didn't call anyone names. Just pointed out that the rest of reddit thinks you're all racists because of the stuff you come out with. And its true, they do. Because of comments like the above.

&gt; Turkey is an obstacle to further EU integration, it's poorer, its population has different ethics and morals, a different religion that many in its east (or in most of Anatolia, for that matter) take VERY seriously and horrifying borders currently full of terrorists. 

Thats a terrible mix of unexamined half-truths. Sure, they are poorer, but so is most of Eastern Europe. No one objects to the *principle* of most of Eastern Europe in the EU. Their population is Muslim, which is what you mean by ""different ethics and morals"" - but as far as Western Europe goes the extreme Catholic devotion you see in many Eastern European nations (Poland, Lithuania) also qualifies for ""different ethics and morals"". Again, no one objects to their membership on the basis of their beliefs. 

Nor is Turkey the only nation with terrorists. France, Spain, the UK,  the former Yugoslavia, and even Ukraine can be said to have similar problems either now or in recent history. Your bias is that of many Europeans - you find 'Muslim terrorists', such as the PKK ""extra scary"". Solely because they are Muslim.

The ""horrifying borders"", are no more horrifying than countries that border Russia. And in Turkeys case are mountainous, easily defensible, and could allow the EU to act as a stabilising influence in the bordering nations. The EU has short-sightedly rejected this possibility, however, in favour of fear.  

The EU didn't even bother to give Turkey a roadmap toward membership. Thats how transparently false all the above rationalisations are.

&gt; All of that is just made worse by its big population. 

Big is relative. Its big in comparison to most EU nations, but not compared to the existing EU population.

When historians speak of Kievan Rus they can refer to two things:

The period of time when Kiev was the capital of Russia (capitals of Russia at that point: Ladoga-Novgorod-Kiev-Vladimir-Moscow-Petersberg-Moscow).

Or the region of Kievan princedom (after Civil War of 1169 Russia broke apart in several princedom, all ruled by the Rurik family, but with little collaboration between them, similar to Feudalism era in Western Europe). This way all the princedoms were called ""Rus of ..."", for example ""Rus of Novgorod"" or ""Rus of Ryazan"".

Modern Russia is just the continuation of the Medieval Rus, once the Mongols invaded several time - Lithuanians took over the Western part of Rus, and the Poles took over the most Western princedom.

While the Eastern part of Rus, yet composed of different princedoms which competed for primacy, remained independent. 

Since after few decades the descendants of Rurikid Alexander of Neva ruled all those princedoms - his Muscovite line just inherited most of them and took by force some others from their cousins. And after that took efforts of retaking the Western parts of Rus that were under Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth control.

Mo'ln conseil c'est de penser à l'avenir à justifier tes positions qui parlent de génies pour certains (surtout quand, soit honnête, le génie en question est largement contesté) et d'odieux pour d'autres.

On a pas besoin d'Unpopular Opinion Puffin sur /r/France, il y en a suffisamment chez /r/adviceanimals 

Sinon du point de vue de ce que tu dis comme justification de ta position. Comme dans la discussion avec Mauvais Conseil ci dessus je pense que les fans de Zemmour tentent le coup classique de justificatif expost : ""Il a jamais voulu utiliser le mot polémique ! c'est une invention des journaliste, et sans ce mot ce qu'il a dit ne pose aucun problème"". 

C'est la même justification que Todd Akin avec l'histoire de son commentaire sur le ""Legitimate Rape"", ou il explique que le sens du mot Legitimate Rape avait été mal compris. Et qu'il regrettait cette mésentente alors que le vrai problème c'est le fond de sa pensée : qu'il faut interdire l'avortement même au femmes victimes de viol car le corps féminin peut selon lui empêcher une grossesse d'avoir lieu en cas de viol réel. 

Zemmour nous fait la même : Il a jamais utilisé le mot déportation, donc rien de mal n'a été dit, il reste un génie et melenchon est un odieux vilain. Alors que l'idée même de ce qu'il propose, déportation prononcé ou non, est complètement scandaleux. Expulser/Déporter/Exiler/Virer, le mot importe peu, ce qu'il veut c'est virer tous les musulmans de France. Et désolé de faire un Godwin (D'ailleurs je ne pense pas que s'en est un, c'est pertinent, mais tout le monde aime tellement parler de Godwin que je prend des précautions) mais c'était le projet initial des nazis pour les juifs allemands. Non pas que Zemmour soit fou au point de proposer la solution finale en cas d'échec de son rêve d'expulsion des musulmans... mais l'idée d'origine est déjà terrifiante et simplement dégueulasse : dire à des gens d'une certaine religion, vous devez partir, car on veut pas de gens comme vous chez nous... c'est juste revulsant (et je dis bien de dire ça juste en raison d'une religion, je suis pas contre le fait que l'état puisse dire à des personnes de quitter la France pour des raisons touchent à leurs actes personnels mais jamais juste parce qu'ils sont d'un groupe X ou Y).

I thought we were talking about civil unions, why are you changing topic?

&gt;So... gays don't have the right to marry or adopt because... gays don't have the right to marry or adopt? That's a tautology, if I know my fallacies. 

State sanctioned marriage exists in order to provide stable environment in which breedeing and development of new citizens occurs (however bad that sounds in English). That's obviously not the case with the same-sex couples.

Else, going further with your logic - threesomes don't have the right to marry of adopt... because threesomes don't have the right to marry or adopt? What a tautology! Why are you being such intolerant shitlord!

As for adoption - I don't see any contraindications as to why a well-off, sane gay person couldn't adopt a child. Technically it's allowed by the Polish law even today, though I doubt it happens often in practice.

&gt;it's not, it's simply allowing traditional institutions

And by doing that, it's vastly changing purpose of those traditional institutions - from its original purpose, which is what I have already mentioned, into merely recognizing that those two people are romantic partners and giving those romanitic partners some tax breaks. Why discriminate single people or those who cannot find a partner? Why don't they deserve tax breaks? Why even have an institution of state-recognized marriage?

I know this is going to be an unpopular post, but you shouldn't downvote me just because I'm the messenger of a reality you dislike.

Preferring the USA over the EU doesn't mean becoming a 52nd state. Unlike European institutions, the USA doesn't have primacy of lawmaking power over us, it doesn't have a court system that can give binding judgments without any checks, and it doesn't force us to have open borders with them. Plus the UK and the USA have a shared history, language, culture and legal basis. The same goes with Australia and Canada.

The government has the ability to calmly evaluate a vast amount of scientific research. Hysteric, easily-panicked swaths of populace don't.

We trust the government to decide what's safe to eat or not. And so far, they're doing a pretty good job at this. If the government puts an official warning on something, it has to have a *legitimate* reason. Otherwise it's inciting panic for nothing.

For example, cigarettes have warnings because they cause cancer.

Candies for which blue beetles are crushed to produce the food coloring don't have a warning label on them. Why? Because they're perfectly safe. However, if a warning label was mandatory saying: ""Warning: this product contains crushed bugs, but it's *probably* safe"" signed by the government, that would crush a legitimate part of the food industry.

So kindly fuck off with your fear-mongering. That's not what the government is for.

Im sorry but this shows a lack of understanding about what selective breeding is.

Selective breeding (also called artificial selection) is the process by which humans breed other animals and plants for particular traits.

This alters the DNA of a species and can even lead to the creation of an entirely new species purely because of human selective breeding.

You do not handle the DNA directly sure but you do change the makeup of a plant/plants DNA indirectly through selective breeding. This is the same except without having to wait generations for the traits to be perfected.

Maybe you should pay attention, then. Not my responsibility what you do or don't read. 

&gt;State sanctioned marriage exists in order to provide stable environment in which breedeing and development of new citizens occurs (however bad that sounds in English). That's obviously not the case with the same-sex couples.

So, what you're saying is infertile people shouldn't be allowed to marry? Also people that don't want children, they should also clearly be banned from marrying since marriage is all about procreating and pumping out as many kids as possible. I'm curious, does Poland have special police force that inspects whether heterosexual couples are procreating or are you just being hypocritical twat? 

&gt;Else, going further with your logic - threesomes don't have the right to marry of adopt... because threesomes don't have the right to marry or adopt? What a tautology! Why are you being such intolerant shitlord!

Yes, yes, if you let gays marry next thing you know people will be marrying their dogs and horses and the next thing you know - it's judgement day! 

&gt;As for adoption - I don't see any contraindications as to why a well-off, sane gay person couldn't adopt a child. Technically it's allowed by the Polish law even today, though I doubt it happens often in practice.

But homosexual couples can't adopt children, in addition to not being able to marry? And you don't see how this is discrimination? It's funny that people like you always go on about how ""brainwashed"" the west is and yet you're the only ones that seem brainwashed by bigotry. 

&gt;And by doing that, it's vastly changing purpose of those traditional institutions - from its original purpose,

How is allowing people to marry in any way changing the institution of marriage? Since I'm not sure if you're aware, church sanctioned gay marriage is a different thing, this is about legally allowing gay people to marry on the same grounds as heterosexuals. Are you implying gay love isn't ""real"" or ""pure""? Are you saying gays are sociopaths that can't love? Do you even know what you're saying? What *is* the so-called ""original purpose"" of marriage? Procreation? Already adressed that. So then what? 

&gt;Why discriminate single people or those who cannot find a partner? Why don't they deserve tax breaks?

What the hell does that have to do with marriage equality and stopping the discrimination? 

&gt;Why even have an institution of state-recognized marriage?

To allow people to marry. Which is the whole debate, where you not paying attention? Gays want their right to marry and you're not letting them. Just to be clear, ""you"" doesn't refer to you, specifically.

You have not even once mentioned ""marriage"" until then. We are discussing under article about ""civil unions"". It's your responsibility to make your point clear, not mine to guess every single possible meaning of your post.

&gt;So, what you're saying is infertile people shouldn't be allowed to marry? Also people that don't want children

Why marry then? For all those sweet sweet tax breaks? I would say that sure, they *are* abusing the system.

&gt;I'm curious, does Poland have special police force that inspects whether heterosexual couples are procreating or are you just being hypocritical twat? 

It does not, but *not procreating* surely is grounds for divorce.

&gt;Yes, yes, if you let gays marry next thing you know people will be marrying their dogs and horses and the next thing you know - it's judgement day! 

So you are indeed against union between three consenting people only because there are **three** of them? And more so, you are equalling it with marrying dogs and horses? And I thought **I** am the ""bigot"" in this conversation :DD

&gt;But homosexual couples can't adopt children

...but technically they can. Sure, it's a shame that they are usually denied when they try even if they are otherwise suitable for being adoptive parents, but that's the result of bad will on courts side. I would like to see this process being fair too.

&gt;in addition to not being able to marry

Again with this dark persecution themes. Homosesxual people aren't explicitly forbidden by law to marry *at all*.

&gt;And you don't see how this is discrimination?

No, I don't see how this is discrimination. What will state saying ""you are married now"" change with their lives? Will they love themselves more now?

&gt;It's funny that people like you always go on about how ""brainwashed"" the west is and yet you're the only ones that seem brainwashed by bigotry. 

I don't think the West is brainwashed. Just experiencing the ""fighting real and supposed discrimination and inequality as a foremost priority"" fad.

&gt;How is allowing people to marry in any way changing the institution of marriage? 

Because you are calling two different things by the same name and give both of them the same privilleges? You are actually *creating* inequality this way.

&gt;this is about legally allowing gay people to marry on the same grounds as heterosexuals.

Why though? Why would state even care about who you love? That's not the purpose of recognizing marriages.

&gt;Are you implying gay love isn't ""real"" or ""pure""? Are you saying gays are sociopaths that can't love?

Of course I'm not. Yet it doesn't in any way warrant state broadening the definition of marriage.

&gt;What is the so-called ""original purpose"" of marriage? Procreation? 

Yes. Procreation, and development of resulting children.

&gt;To allow people to marry. Which is the whole debate, where you not paying attention? Gays want their right to marry and you're not letting them.

Yes, but the whole debate is completely absurdal though. They don't just want the simple act of marriage ceremony, but also all the privilleges connected with it. Privilleges, which exist for reasons they are, unfortunately, *unable* to meet.

Now you're contradicting yourself repeatedly. An extra 75million muslims would not make the EU majority Muslim. You also are implicitly implying that being Muslim is somehow ""a problem"". 

&gt; Also note that I have nothing against muslims in theory. I'm also not going to assume a muslim is evil, insane or a terrorist upon meeting him or her. However, in practice, muslims have proven themselves over and over and over again to be violent and unstable, which isn't something we need in the EU. Furthemore, most of those 75,000,000 are hardline, conservative muslims in Anatolia. The kind we really, really don't need in the EU. Furthemore, Turkey isn't even a proper democracy right now and Erdogan is running rampant with no sign of stepping down, this in a country where historically military junta decided everything in politics. This is who you're arguing to enter. 

You then go on to say how you don't have a problem with Muslims.. but then describe why you have a problem with Muslims. You also start talking about how ""most"" of Turkey is ""hardline"" Muslim, but provide no definition of what you consider hardline, or any proof of what you say. 

You then talk about ISIS as if this somehow represents all Muslims, whilst conveniently forgetting that all the people fighting them tooth and nail on the ground are also Muslims. 

You also cite a tiny mountainous border with Iraq/Syria as a problem.. but presumably you don't have a problem with the massive land border the EU has with Russia, which is only set to get bigger.

I mean.. you couldn't express a clearer set of discriminatory beliefs if you went ahead and listed them yourself. Its astonishing you can't see it. Everything else you've listed is a smokescreen for your own xenophobia.

As to wether we ""need"" Turkey.. well there are so many problems with that statement, where do I start? Who decides what we ""need""? Are we now an organisation that admits only those that we ""need""? Who *else* don't we ""need""? The UK? You'd probably get along fine without them. Probably most of Eastern Europe too. Should they all leave based on lack of ""need""? 

As for Turkey - they thought they did need us until they were so rudely rejected out of hand. Now they're trying to find a new place in the world, and that is always a painful process.

Le persone accanto a chi compie questa scelta inevitabilmente ne soffriranno. Ma, come tante altre scelte, se la persona è adulta e vaccinata, si presuppone che scelga quello che è meglio per lei (almeno date le circostanze). Quindi, per quanto traumatizzati o dispiaciuti, le persone accanto a chi compie questa scelta dovranno smettere gli egoismi e semplicemente accettare e capire che chi ha fatto questa scelta aveva le sue ragioni (condivisibili o meno). Rimane il dolore per la perdita, ma prima accettiamo di non avere controllo su gli altri e le loro scelte e meglio è. Nel bene o nel male. Quindi anche i sensi di colpa lasciano il tempo che trovano.

Quello di cui si parla in questo thread non ha assolutamente niente a spartire con queste dinamiche. Si tratta di una violenza ai danni di una persona che non c' entra niente e che può essere benissimo evitata. 
Sia il poliziotto che ci rimane cercando di salvarti (perchè succede anche questo) sia il macchinista che rimane segnato a vita, non c'entra nulla col lutto di una famiglia di cui parli.

Poi, scusa una nota a parte. So benissimo che le tue intenzioni sono buone ma non è piacevole sentirsi dire banali luoghi comuni su momenti davvero complessi che non possono essere banalizzati con frasi di circostanza.

4) il fatto che dei periti indiani concordino con tutte le ricostruzioni fatte da accusatori indiani mi sembra piuttosto ovvio;
5) se i nostri Marò fossero stati di un altro paese, semplicemente li sarebbero andati a prendere: esempio lampante è la storia dei due ""top gun"" americani che dopo aver tranciato i cavi di una funivia ammazzando (se nn ricordo male) una 40ina di persone, sono stati velocemente estradati;
6) cosa potrebbe fare l'italia? Ritirare qualsiasi militare da qualsivoglia missione all'estero, visto anche il silenzio internazionale che c'è al riguardo; a me sembra tanto che sia il solito motivetto ""tanto sono italiani""; perchè parliamoci chiaro, avremmo anche una marea di difetti, ma cerchiamo di evitare di smerdarci più di quello che serve;

you have no idea what you are talking about. cause I'm just 'lel another butthurt russophobe Balt'. thing is, it's not the question about you in personal, and not even about the people living in Russia.

Russian society (as any other more or less) takes a queue from its leaders, and what does your tsar talk about? everything is US fault, we did nothing wrong, we don't have to apologize for nothing.

he literally says that kind of things. and who would have guessed, your society repeats everything! 

we have Homeland Union (conservative party) in Lithuania, they've been telling since forever: let's demand Russia for reparations, let's ask them to admit on highest level their wrongdoings and apologize, etc. most of Lithuanian population were skeptical about that (me included) - why bring the past up? let's trade and deal and work and travel, let the bygones be bygones. but I guess they were right all along. without accepting responsibility Russia justifies Soviet crimes, and it's especially seen now, when Putin talks about whitewashing Stalin, bringing back Soviet Union hymn, rewriting schoolbooks, TV shows on state owned channels that praises him, etc.

that way you, as society, will always cling to the cancerous past and won't search for the future. as Vitaly Portnikov said - the one and true Russian tsar is The Oil. even Putin says prayers for her. 

&gt;I am sorry for everything bad

I guess I appreciate that you are not some 'Soviet times all good' type of guy, but I'm really not fishing for apologies from Russians in reddit or something. and truly I feel cringy when I see Russian redditors apologizing for something Russian tourists did in all-inclusive resorts in Egypt or whatever, after anti-Russian circlejerk in this sub.

Il bruton era/è una fantastica birreria artigianale appena fuori i confini del comune lucchese in direzione garfagnana. Nello stabilimento era compreso un bar-pub e un ristorante.

Ai tempi era di proprietà di un ragazzo che insieme al fratello e altri ragazzi [non sono scuro al 100% cmq irrilevante al fatto] gestivano la produzione/esportazione del prodotto, il bar (spesso lui era alla spina) e il ristorante.

Tutti ragazzi fenomenali (il proprietario in particolare), birra eccellente, locale rinomato ecc ecc.

L'unica cosa fuori posto (e qui partono le mie congetture) è dovuta alla natura politica del proprietario che già in passato gli aveva dato alcuni problemi (non per colpa sua ma perchè questa città è piena di gente che al posto del cervello ha un chilo di materia fecale).

Nell'andare del tempo il posto prese la nomina di locale comunista, e non si sa bene perchè dato che mai una volta ho visto mezza bandiera o sentito inneggiare a qualsiasi partito politico, e ovviamente attirò le attenzioni degli (in)famosi bulldog, che ovviamente dovevano andare a romprere le palle in giro, il perchè solo loro lo sapevano (ovviamente sto parlando di avvenimenti accaduto nell'arco di vari anni e per fortuna che non ebbero mai grossi strascichi se non quello di chiamare le forze dell'ordine per segnalare/allontanare certi induvidui, ma quello purtroppo può capitare a qualsiasi posto prima o poi).

Fast forward fino a qualche anno fa, poco prima del fattaccio.

I locali quali pub/bar vengono tartassati dal comune in ogni modo, in particolare quelli in centro/intorno alle mura cittadine e quelli che attiravano un certo giro di illegalità (fumo, erba, forse coca); l'impressione è quella di voler uccidere la cosiddetta movida cittadina. Alcuni locali purtroppo saltano, ma il bruton no, e come poteva? era a km dal centro, quasi isolato e non si era formato quel giro di droga che altri avevano; se cercavi qualcosa andavi in altri locali, ma in ogni caso Lucca come comune non era il posto ideale.

Al che arrivano le prime voci di una possibile offerta di acquisto dell'immobile per trasfmormare il posto in un semplice impianto di  produzione della birra, alla quale il proprietario si rifiuta.

Ed ecco che da li a poco accadde il fattaccio: dei sedicenti bulldog (da notare che la squadra di calcio ormai è tuttora quasi inesistente, fallita e rifallita più volte, credo che attualmente giochi in serie dilettante se si chiama così) senza un vero pretesto una sera entrarono nel locale e dopo vari inneggiamenti filo-fascisti, BAM, scattò la rissa e un ragazzo perse un occhio per via di quel bicchiere.

[Tralascio la tragedia di questo poveraccio solo per rimanere sul discorso che sto scrivendo, ma non per questo vuol dire che non sia importante]
Proprietario distrutto psicologicamente, clientela azzerata, fama del posto sparita come se non fosse mai importato a nessuno; andai a farmi una birra con la mia fidanzata qualche sera dopo, c'era più allegria in un obitorio.

Da li a breve vendette/diede in gestione non so i particolari.

Ora dove prima c'era il bar sono stati messi altri fusti per la produzione, al primo piano è rimasto il ristorante, la birra ha perso quel tocco di artigianale che la contraddistingueva (a mio parere sa di chimico, forse la conseguenza di una maggiore commercilizzazione), ma soprattutto questa città ha perso, o per meglio dire ha voluto fare fuori, l'ultimo locale dove poter fare bagordi senza dover essere un fighetto, sapete cosa intendo: ogni città ha i locali da fighetti e altri diciamo meno esigenti; ecco il bruton era abbastanza caro come posto (birra artigianale=€€€), però potevi andarci come ti pareva, ognuno si faceva gli affari suoi e se capitavi nella serata giusta beccavi pure gruppi dal vivo ska,punk,rock etc etc.

Per farla breve: non mi torna che un gruppo inneggiante al fascismo ormai non più attivo e con buona parte di loro in carcere sia magicamente riapparso e sia andato a rompere le palle ad un locale che di comunista aveva solo la maglietta del Che indossata ogni tanto dal proprietario e la sua [stupenda] barba, e per puro caso poco dopo il suo rifiuto di vendere.

Purtroppo le mie sono solo supposizioni.

&gt; Social Studies

Ich verstehe schon dass einem Naturwissenschaftler der Mangel an Rigorosität mancher Sozialwissenschaftler auf den Sack geht. Der deutsche Begriff Wissenschaft ist aber eben nicht identisch mit ""science"", zumindest seit ungefähr 150 Jahren. Im anglophonen Raum wurden Fächer wie Philosophie, Mathematik und Kunst *herunterstilisiert*, nicht umgekehrt. 

Eine Wissenschaft muss nicht empirisch sein, um Wissen festhalten zu können. Dementsprechend muss sie auch nicht falsifizierbar sein. Davon abgesehen ist kritischer Empirismus extrem unpraktisch, und schon deshalb stark aus der Mode gekommen.

Ein ethisches System muss harmonisch sein, das heißt alle Prämissen sind notwendig und führen lückenlos zu den Konklusionen.

Warum also mögen Philosophen diese Abweichler nicht, die Egoismus als höchstes Prinzip der Moral erwägen? Weil moralische Systeme eigentlich das Allgemeinwohl fördern sollten, und die Argumentation der ""Objektivisten"", abgesehen von offensichtlichen argumentativen Schwächen, auch bei empirischen Untersuchungen durchfällt.

&gt; Die angebliche Wissenschaft wird so zur Echokammer, und zeigt, daß die Disziplin eigentlich überflüssig ist.

Auf welcher Basis machst du diese ""Beobachtung""? Soweit ich das beurteilen kann, tun wir nichts außer unsere Systeme gegenseitig zu kritisieren.

http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

&gt;Modern meaning of ""one of the great divisions of mankind based on physical peculiarities"" is from 1774 (though as OED points out, even among anthropologists there never has been an accepted classification of these).

Before the late 18th century, it *wasn't even used in the sense we use it today*. 

&gt;Original senses in English included ""wines with characteristic flavor"" (1520), ""group of people with common occupation"" (c.1500), and ""generation"" (1540s). 

The meaning changed *because people started using the word to mean something else than its original definition*. That's not doublespeak. That's how language has been working for thousands of years. Languages evolve, and they do so because people change them over time, ever so gradually, word by word. Meanings are not intrinsically linked to words, and they can shift over time if people make it so, and the new meaning a word has acquired is then no less valid than the previous one. 

Another example. The word ""language"" comes from a word that originally meant ""tongue"". Does that mean that anyone who uses ""language"" as anything other than ""tongue"" is using doublespeak?

Where did I say otherwise? I never implied we treated the American Indians well by twenty first century standards. The American Indians didn't treat Europeans or each other well by those standard either. It was a radically different culture. Europeans and American Indians were using and abusing each other to gain an advantage over their enemies. The European technology gave them the advantage so they came to dominate the situation. Any of the American Indian tribes would have done the same if they could have. 

Saying the assimilation wasn't forces was probably misleading. The American Indians weren't allowed to pursue their traditional way of life. They weren't allowed to raid neighboring villages, rape, mutilate, and kidnap the women and children, and kill the elderly and infirm. They weren't allowed to remain illiterate. Since they didn't have a written language, that meant they had to learn English. They also had to learn the American system of laws and governance. Land didn't necessarily become yours simply because you had the power to take and hold it. So to a certain degree they were forced to accommodate the ""white man's ways"". There was simply no way these two cultures could live in harmony. 

To a large degree assimilation wasn't forced. Europeans started intermarrying with American Indians as soon as they landed. As far as I know these marriages weren't forced. It didn't take the American Indians long to realize that living in houses with solid walls and roofs, and doors and windows that would open and close was better than living in a chukka or a tepee. Having as well behind your house was better than having to walk the nearest stream  to get water or wash your clothes. Having an outhouse was much better than having to squat outside in a blizzard.

The point is the option won because most people had no clue what the difference between the options were, and so to drag out Norway as an argument for withdrawing from the EU and staying in the EEA is just ridiculous - there was no informed debate over EEA membership, and no referendum,  and from taking part in the EU debates in '94 it was clear most voters didn't give a shit because the decision had already taken. 

People were scared about EU membership over losing sovereignty. But we did lose the same amount of sovereignty by entering the EEA. 

The only thing the attitudes over this demonstrates is that the Norwegian public are completely clueless about the issue.

For Norway the loss of sovereignty perhaps did not matter so much, because we are a small enough country that we'd have very little influence anyway.

The French never spy and only act in mutal interest. Give me a break.

All the governments, especially of the ""big three"" European coutries, practice *real politik*, they don't care about the spying. They already know it happens. It is a good thing to act mad about as it will win you support without any real chance of repercusisons. 

Especially note the French actions towards Germany, revealed by wikileaks, trying to find the specific link now. Quote is 

&gt;France is the evil empire, stealing technology, and Germany knows this”, and that French industrial espionage was so widespread that it did far more damage to the German economy than that of China or Russia. 

They are all as bad as each other.

Also as a bonus testament to the gloriously moral French espionage service.

&gt; we don't have exact numbers for gun ownership because we specifically have laws to prevent their collection


Numbers for gun ownership help you prevent unlawful criminal action how?

&gt;this is nothing but a much of conspiracy theory garbage and gross ignorance. For instance, the recent rescinding of Missouri's Universal Background Checks caused a rise in overall homicides by 14%. It also caused a significant rise of firearms at that origininated in Missouri being found at crime scenes in neighboring states.


Single State trend.  

The national registration of firearms in the UK and Australia outright allowed national mandatory confiscation.  

&gt;The evidence that gun control makes it harder for criminals to acquire firearms is overwhelming. 

Because between  Chicago and Vermont, one is super safe, and one is the wild west because it has no laws restricting concealed carry lol, right?


BTW - we could **end** things like child porn circulation if only you'd permanently Gove up your email and physical mail privacy.  

Are you an advocate of revoking modem privacy?

No one imagined things like that in 1776!
