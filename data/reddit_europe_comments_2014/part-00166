true,ImNotACreep__Really,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"I realize you're asking for suggestions - and I'll provide some - but I feel like you're being a little unjust against duolingo and am going to provide a little defense in their name. Feel free to skip to the end to avoid it. 

You -should- be marked wrong. They're asking for you to interpret one word and you're providing another (Haus vs. Hause). There's an idiom ""A house a home does not make"" or some such. It's the equivalent of you ordering trout at a restaurant and getting sea bass and them saying ""well, it's a fish."" 

The ""Er trinkt Kaffee und Tee."" opposed to ""Er trinkt Kaffee oder Tee."" is a little more of a gray area. The first clearly implies he enjoys both whereas the second may also imply ""he drinks coffee or tea [but I can't remember which]"", so again, there is a difference and not communicating that effectively can cause confusion. 

I completely agree with you on the er/ihr thing. Also, mir/mehr. 

All that said, I hope you stick with duolingo as, despite its many food reference and sometimes comical sentences, I find it a very useful tool. 

The suggestions:

- It gets a lot of grief but I really liked Rosetta Stone. 

- The book ""Essential German Grammar"" by Martin Durrell is fantastic and makes as much fun of grammar as one can and explains things very well. 

- The iPhone app by Filmonfree.com will let you watch german movies. Not sure what's on there but I know Finding Nemo is there.

- I am also reading the cafe in Berlin series and recommend sticking with them as they're easy reading and introduce new vocabulary. 


I hope this helps some. Viel Glück!

Nobody ignores it. Plenty of organisations, governments included, attempt to calculate the value. All these organisations propose ways to reduce the value of the underground economy. Basing EU funding from it is completely different though, and very wrong.

&gt; I am not sure how did you get the idea that this is to increase EU's funding.

From the post I initially responded to. If the underground economy is added onto GDP, then the EU's funding will be affected positively by it. This is a suggestion from the EU as well.

&gt; GDP doesn't fund the European Union. Taxes do. Those illegal activities aren't taxed, they would only be included in GDP calculations. If they latched onto it, they would be immediately shot down.

The post I responded to argued EU funding was based on GDP. Hence my arguments against including the underground economy in GDP.

&gt; As I said, it isn't included in the calculations because of moral reasons, not legal ones.

The reason they cannot be included is because the value cannot be accurately calculated. This is because they are not legal.

Yes, we do, as per the treaty.

&gt;britain broke the treaty with spain in almost every possible way

Claims Spain, yet without proving in any substational way. Their claim that the UK giving a referendum to the people of Gib allowing them to choose whether to stay British violates Spain's right of refusal is absurd.

&gt;oh and btw you didnt care about the inhabitants when you occupied it did you?

So?

&gt;Britain has no interest in gilbraltar

That's clearly nonsense though. Of course we have an interest in it. Those are British people and they have the right to stay British if they wish.

&gt;How about you give gilbratar back to stop being douchy and to do something positive?

So you're suggesting that revoking the citizenship or at least forcibly taking 30,000 people's home from them would be ""stopping"" being douchy? Are you serious?

&gt;You can complain about the excuses that spain gets to ask gilbratar back, but britain excuses to keep it arent any good either

We don't need excuses, it's ours by law and by possession and it will stay that way so long as the inhabitants desire it to stay as such.

true,Bigfluffyltail,FRAN,Lived in the US for a long time.,"Oh no I'm just saying they were quite respected but DeGaulle moved public opinion from them (and to him) which would explain the later polls. The only other time DeGaulle and the communists collaborated was against the common European army, which was a french idea because it was aimed to promote peace in Europe but also keep the USSR away (so they didn't like that) and DeGaulle's nationalism. Their argument is resumed in the affiche: ""En un siècle, trois invasions allemandes"" (they didn't want to give military power to Germany).

The resistants are certainly a factor for the first poll but by far not the main one.

I can understand why me talking about the resistants at first can seem out of place in the conversation. What I meant was communism was very present (not all communists resisted) and the USSR was seen at ally at the time (that changed quickly), all of which isn't true as of today: I was trying to underline the change illustrated by the polls.

You're right, the change is most certainly due to propaganda and the cold war context, although I'd like to mention most French people do know that the USSR was a huge contributor to the end of the war, at least those of us who listened in class. I personally remember being surprised when I learnt about it, so I understand where these polls come from.

Also, I'd like to add that us French are notorious for being 'flip-flop' voters: we change opinions quickly and often randomly, to the great frustration of our politians who want us to be votes they can count on and they don't seem to grasp that we are not fixed and cannot be put in a box: our opinions can change, sometimes towards the last minute as illustrated by the presidential vote of Chirac against le pen. This would probably explain polls you might see where our opinion changes over a short amount of time (so...not this poll but useful to know).",0,1402506906,null,0,false,0,ci4xbzc,t3_27s2ch,t1_ci4xbzc,t1_ci4vik6,null,1434193573,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You're right, it is easier for rich people to start a business. That will always be the case.

I'd avoid Brussels personally too. No offense to Belgians, but I don't think it's a very nice city to visit. You should definitely stop by a more modest Belgian city and try their fries, and mussels dishes though.

But overall, that's too many cities. I work in a hostel in Paris and I find it a real shame when tourists just drop by for one night only to leave early the next morning to another destination.

France fought major wars during his reign, and all were won (at least partly). It was the most powerful state of Europe.

Internally, Louis XIV built upon the work of his fathers and finished the process begun by Phillip IV, that is the centralization of power in the hands of the king. He also was a patron of the arts, and built many monuments and buildings such as the *Colonnade du Louvre* or the Castle of Versailles.

The big problem with Louis XIV was that, as powerful and respected (feared, even : his Royal Apartments in Versailles stayed the same for decades after his death) he was, none of his accomplishment stuck on the long term.

I'm not entirely sure what effect that would have on the overall war effort but an attack on Stalin's war industry would have seriously dragged on the conflict, if not outright turned the tide in the favor of the Axis. I think the Pacific front was the more significant contribution to the war effort by the US. The USSR was able to capitalize on superior strength and strategic mistakes by German military planners to quickly overwhelm the Germans and turn the tide. It's not a bad thing that the US, or UK or Russia/former Soviet states emphasize more on their parts of WWII. It's part of their national identity to highlight their contributions.  Another heavy contributor to the notion that ""American won WWI"" was the state of occupied territory after hostilities ended.

Second, I believe it is semantics - one definition for Country (source: Oxford Dictionaries) is 'A nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory' - whilst Scotland has a devolved parliament, it comes under the Jurisdiction of a government which is not 'its own' - the UK parliament. By this definition is not a country. However, the Government (as in UK Gov) defines England, Scotland, Wales and NI as 'countries' in a more geographical sense. 

If one were to say 'I'm going to another country', you wouldn't think them to mean that they're going to Scotland from England, more likely somewhere like France - The definition of 'foreign' is 'in/from/of a country other that one's own', but an Englishman wouldn't call something from Scotland 'foreign' - not without sounding a bit strange anyway

Did you not do history in school? I'm sorry but come on! Americans not knowing the differences - fine, they're an ocean away. But another British person not knowing? 

Scotland is a country in political union with England. It was The Kingdom of Scotland - then came into personal union with England through King James (I and VI), and was later brought into political union through the Act of Union 1707.

&gt;  one definition for Country (source: Oxford Dictionaries) is 'A nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory' - whilst Scotland has a devolved parliament, it comes under the Jurisdiction of a government which is not 'its own' - the UK parliament. By this definition is not a country

How is any of the relevant?  At all? Let's arbitrarily pick another common dictionary definition: coun·try  [kuhn-tree] 
noun, plural coun·tries.
1.
a state or nation
2.
the territory of a nation.

Scotland is both a nation and a state. That still means nothing, it's just a dictionary definition. I'm posting it here to show you how little it means.

Stop acting like this is some disputed matter, like it's an opinion. It isn't. I'm talking 100% solid fact. Watch the video I linked earlier for sources. 

&gt; If one were to say 'I'm going to another country', you wouldn't think them to mean that they're going to Scotland from England, more likely somewhere like France - The definition of 'foreign' is 'in/from/of a country other that one's own', but an Englishman wouldn't call something from Scotland 'foreign' - not without sounding a bit strange anyway

You've got to be kidding me? This is worse than anecdotal evidence. Let me try: My mum always says ""let's go to another country on holiday, like Scotland - because it's very foreign"". Wow, that was easy.

tl;dr Scotland is a country, and has been for centuries, with it's own independent legal and judicial system, but it is currently under union with England. It is not an independent country, because it was brought into union via the ascension of King James to both thrones, then into political union via the Act of Union. Wales was not a separate country in it's own right - it was not an independent kingdom in the way Scotland was, and it was conquered into the English crown. Scotland was not. I repeat - it was brought into union through legitimate procedures that maintained it as a separate country, but sharing the same crown. Imagine Westminster as the shared king. Even when Scotland did not have it's own parliament, all laws continued to assert Scotland being a country. All official legal bodies in the entire world consider Scotland to be a country. This DOES NOT MEAN it is a sovereign state - it isn't. But it's still a country - in union with England.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Her full statement is actually nicely thought out and worth a read. I would have just posted the link but her website is fucking annoying. 

&gt;I came to the question of independence with an open mind and an awareness of the seriousness of what we are being asked to decide. This is not a general election, after which we can curse the result, bide our time and hope to get a better result in four years. Whatever Scotland decides, we will probably find ourselves justifying our choice to our grandchildren. I wanted to write this because I always prefer to explain in my own words why I am supporting a cause and it will be made public shortly that I’ve made a substantial donation to the Better Together Campaign, which advocates keeping Scotland part of the United Kingdom.


&gt;As everyone living in Scotland will know, we are currently being bombarded with contradictory figures and forecasts/warnings of catastrophe/promises of Utopia as the referendum approaches and I expect we will shortly be enjoying (for want of a better word) wall-to-wall coverage.


&gt;In the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I am friendly with individuals involved with both the Better Together Campaign and the Yes Campaign, so I know that there are intelligent, thoughtful people on both sides of this question. Indeed, I believe that intelligent, thoughtful people predominate.


&gt;However, I also know that there is a fringe of nationalists who like to demonise anyone who is not blindly and unquestionably pro-independence and I suspect, notwithstanding the fact that I’ve lived in Scotland for twenty-one years and plan to remain here for the rest of my life, that they might judge me ‘insufficiently Scottish’ to have a valid view. It is true that I was born in the West Country and grew up on the Welsh border and while I have Scottish blood on my mother’s side, I also have English, French and Flemish ancestry. However, when people try to make this debate about the purity of your lineage, things start getting a little Death Eaterish for my taste. By residence, marriage, and out of gratitude for what this country has given me, my allegiance is wholly to Scotland and it is in that spirit that I have been listening to the months of arguments and counter-arguments.
On the one hand, the Yes campaign promises a fairer, greener, richer and more equal society if Scotland leaves the UK, and that sounds highly appealing. I’m no fan of the current Westminster government and I couldn’t be happier that devolution has protected us from what is being done to health and education south of the border. I’m also frequently irritated by a London-centric media that can be careless and dismissive in its treatment of Scotland. On the other hand, I’m mindful of the fact that when RBS needed to be bailed out, membership of the union saved us from economic catastrophe and I worry about whether North Sea oil can, as we are told by the ‘Yes’ campaign, sustain and even improve Scotland’s standard of living.


&gt;Some of the most pro-independence people I know think that Scotland need not be afraid of going it alone, because it will excel no matter what. This romantic outlook strikes a chord with me, because I happen to think that this country is exceptional, too. Scotland has punched above its weight in just about every field of endeavour you care to mention, pouring out world-class scientists, statesmen, economists, philanthropists, sportsmen, writers, musicians and indeed Westminster Prime Ministers in quantities you would expect from a far larger country.


&gt;My hesitance at embracing independence has nothing to do with lack of belief in Scotland’s remarkable people or its achievements. The simple truth is that Scotland is subject to the same twenty-first century pressures as the rest of the world. It must compete in the same global markets, defend itself from the same threats and navigate what still feels like a fragile economic recovery. The more I listen to the Yes campaign, the more I worry about its minimisation and even denial of risks. Whenever the big issues are raised – our heavy reliance on oil revenue if we become independent, what currency we’ll use, whether we’ll get back into the EU - reasonable questions are drowned out by accusations of ‘scaremongering.’ Meanwhile, dramatically differing figures and predictions are being slapped in front of us by both campaigns, so that it becomes difficult to know what to believe.


&gt;I doubt I’m alone in trying to find as much impartial and non-partisan information as I can, especially regarding the economy. Of course, some will say that worrying about our economic prospects is poor-spirited, because those people take the view ‘I’ll be skint if I want to and Westminster can’t tell me otherwise’. I’m afraid that’s a form of ‘patriotism’ that I will never understand. It places higher importance on ‘sticking it’ to David Cameron, who will be long gone before the full consequences of independence are felt, than to looking after your own. It prefers the grand ‘up yours’ gesture to considering what you might be doing to the prospects of future generations.
The more I have read from a variety of independent and unbiased sources, the more I have come to the conclusion that while independence might give us opportunities – any change brings opportunities – it also carries serious risks. The Institute for Fiscal Studies concludes that Alex Salmond has underestimated the long-term impact of our ageing population and the fact that oil and gas reserves are being depleted. This view is also taken by the independent study ‘Scotland’s Choices: The Referendum and What Happens Afterwards’ by Iain McLean, Jim Gallagher and Guy Lodge, which says that ‘it would be a foolish Scottish government that planned future public expenditure on the basis of current tax receipts from North Sea oil and gas’.


&gt;My fears about the economy extend into an area in which I have a very personal interest: Scottish medical research. Having put a large amount of money into Multiple Sclerosis research here, I was worried to see an open letter from all five of Scotland’s medical schools expressing ‘grave concerns’ that independence could jeopardise what is currently Scotland’s world-class performance in this area. Fourteen professors put their names to this letter, which says that Alex Salmond’s plans for a common research funding area are ‘fraught with difficulty’ and ‘unlikely to come to fruition’. According to the professors who signed the letter, ‘it is highly unlikely that the remaining UK would tolerate a situation in which an independent “competitor” country won more money than it contributed.’ In this area, as in many others, I worry that Alex Salmond’s ambition is outstripping his reach.
I’ve heard it said that ‘we’ve got to leave, because they’ll punish us if we don’t’, but my guess is that if we vote to stay, we will be in the heady position of the spouse who looked like walking out, but decided to give things one last go. All the major political parties are currently wooing us with offers of extra powers, keen to keep Scotland happy so that it does not hold an independence referendum every ten years and cause uncertainty and turmoil all over again. I doubt whether we will ever have been more popular, or in a better position to dictate terms, than if we vote to stay.


&gt;If we leave, though, there will be no going back. This separation will not be quick and clean: it will take microsurgery to disentangle three centuries of close interdependence, after which we will have to deal with three bitter neighbours. I doubt that an independent Scotland will be able to bank on its ex-partners’ fond memories of the old relationship once we’ve left. The rest of the UK will have had no say in the biggest change to the Union in centuries, but will suffer the economic consequences. When Alex Salmond tells us that we can keep whatever we’re particularly attached to – be it EU membership, the pound or the Queen, or insists that his preferred arrangements for monetary union or defence will be rubber-stamped by our ex-partners - he is talking about issues that Scotland will need, in every case, to negotiate. In the words of ‘Scotland’s Choices’ ‘Scotland will be very much the smaller partner seeking arrangements from the UK to meet its own needs, and may not be in a very powerful negotiating position.’


&gt;If the majority of people in Scotland want independence I truly hope that it is a resounding success. While a few of our fiercer nationalists might like to drive me forcibly over the border after reading this, I’d prefer to stay and contribute to a country that has given me more than I can easily express. It is because I love this country that I want it to thrive. Whatever the outcome of the referendum on 18th September, it will be a historic moment for Scotland. I just hope with all my heart that we never have cause to look back and feel that we made a historically bad mistake.",0,1402511859,null,0,false,0,ci4zuye,t3_27vay7,t1_ci4zuye,t3_27vay7,null,1434194764,107,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,107

You're wrong. You've never been more wrong in your life. If you tried to be more wrong right now - you couldn't. 

You obviously aren't aware of UK history if you don't even know that Scotland is a country under union with England. The key word there being ""under"".

The UK Parliament = The King/Queen. If Scotland had their own Parliament of the same calibre, then that would equate to them having their own monarch, because Parliament exists as the continuation of the monarch. So obviously they don't have one, as if they did then they wouldn't be under a union.

true,demostravius,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Different people like different styles of writing. For example I love to read, but I thought Lord of the Rings was boring and badly written. I am sure someone who likes that style however could tell me in detail why it's genius.

If mass appeal doesn't count as a method of measure, why does quantity of books count? I have read hundreds but still don't like some of the greats.

Reading a lot of books you already consider to be great is rather a self fulfilling cycle. It it's not in that style it cannot be considered great.

A lot of people like to say Rowling is crude (after all it is a childs book) however great complexity of writing can easily take away from the quality as it makes reading a chore not a pleasure. Not all characters have to have immense depth (and those who have depth still get criticised for being predictable or not deep enough).

For me the originality of the story, the interwoven characters (though I wish books 1-3 would be re-written with all the original content), the sheer grip the book holds on the reader and the amounts of research that went into the story are what make it a great book. For example the different terms for spells are based on different languages depending on their use. 

Household spells tend to be based off of Old English words, because English household words are usually rooted in Old English. More business like and grand spells are based on Latin, as our business words are often rooted in Latin. The same applies to Greek and medical spells.

At the end of the day everyone has their own opinions and no matter how much you read not everyone will agree what makes a good book.

Per esempio, se sto parlando della storia finlandese con un finlandese, ci sono parecchie possibilità che loro non sappiano l'irredentismo italiano, mentre noi abbiamo modo di sapere perlomeno a grandi linee la questione della Karelia. (che poi magari era l'unico a non saperlo, eh, ma era un esempio fatto per non tirare in ballo gli amerighi con cui ho avuto parecchie esperienze simili)",0,1402513239,null,0,false,0,ci50kam,t3_27w7b0,t1_ci50kam,t1_ci500n8,null,1434195095,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2
true,linkxvi,no-borders,,"Partendo dal presupposto che, a mio avviso, uno studio troppo settoriale, tra i 14 e i 18 anni, non è produttivo (cioè tu a 14 anni mica lo sai di voler fare l'informatico, potresti pure cambiare idea); il latino è fondamentale in un liceo. Esistono gli istituti tecnici, dove le materie umanistiche sono ridotte all'osso, e i risultati sono indubbiamente peggiori rispetto a quelli dei licei.

Vuoi un esempio pratico? La forma, nella scrittura. Può sembrare ridicolo quando sei lì a fare la versione, ma poi si rivela un fatto importante: la padronanza della lingua italiana si assume studiando il latino. I contorti periodi di Cicerone sono un esempio chiaro, insegnano anche l'ars oratoria, che può rivelarsi sempre utile.

Inoltre, a mio avviso, studiare qualcosa di VERAMENTE difficile come il latino e il greco, rende tutto il resto più facile. Fai l'esempio dell'economia: un manuale di economia può avere periodi con strutture complesse, termini difficili e concetti ardui da comprendere. Chi ha studiato il latino lo comprende più facilmente. Chiedi a un prof. di economia se sono più capaci gli studenti del classico o quelli dell'istituto tecnico economico (non so il nome preciso).",0,1402513244,null,0,false,0,ci50kei,t3_27w7b0,t1_ci50kei,t1_ci4zchl,null,1434195097,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

true,bunnybutt420,IREL,Ireland,"I posted this in [r/ireland](http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland) some while back for someone looking for some tips,

- check out Christ Church Cathedral &amp; Dublin Castle for the Medieval period and loads of viking fun! Christ Church Cathedral is the resting place of Strongbow, Norman ruler of a lot of Ireland, and it also provides access to the oldest functioning structure in Dublin, the 1,000 year old crypt. Plus there's some pretty cool (and old) art in the National Gallery on Merrion Sq/Nassau street.
- Temple Bar is full of tourists - go there if you like but remember it's just a show put on for visitors. You'll find a lot more locals in the warren of streets between George's St and South Williams St. In fact you could have an unbelievable night on South William St alone - Port House for tapas dinner, Grogan's for a pint and Pygmalion or South William St venue for a bit of a dance.
- The majority of food in Dublin is shite and nothing special at all. We have the freshest (and best agricultural) food in the world but we get a French or German man to cook it. If you see places in and around Dublin City (read: Temple Bar) offering 'stews, ceoil and craic', forget about it. Find a nice restaurant and eat a decently cooked salmon or steak. That's really what it's all about. Check out Lovin' Dublin, THE best dublin food review resource and eat like a local!
- Howth is only a half hour DART (coastal rail system) ride away from Dublin and offers some on Ireland's nicest hiking views. Take a stroll, have some Beshoff's fish and chips on the pier, and finish the night off in the Bloody Stream pub -- http://howthpathways.com/loopwalks.html
- One touristy place that is worth going to is Leo Burdock's chipper (fish and chip shop). This place has won award after award for having the best fish and chips in the country.

Yes, it really is. It's even so amazing you don't realize it.

&gt; We have established, and you have not contradicted, that the referendum has no validity because of ballot stuffing, bussed-in voters and Russian citizens voting.

A referendum can be invalid yet still produce an outcome that represents the will of the people. All you have proven so far is that the amount of issued yes-votes is higher than the amount of Crimeans wishing to vote yes. What you should prove however, and what you have so far failed to prove, is that the amount of Crimeans honestly wishing reunification is less than 50%.

&gt; And not only is the conclusion you draw from this that the majority of Crimeans wanted reunification, but your only evidence to this statement of yours is a link that contains the words:

No, that comes from the actual polling information I linked to, which you so far have tried very hard to ignore.

&gt; Mejlis also stated that only 34.2% of Crimea residents participated in the referendum.[118][119]

Which is the same as the 1996 US Congressional elections. It's also merely a claim by someone based on nothing more than his undocumented ""sources"". Your point being?

&gt; And you're asking me to prove the majority of Crimeans didn't want to reunifiy with Russians? I say again; never go into science. You'll fail the first methodology course.

So far you have proven nothing, and not even managed to find any inconsistencies in my methodology. You have so far refused to even address my main proof, instead you try to keep derailing the argument by focusing it on the methodology of the referendum itself instead of the history of the region and over two decades worth of polling results and political strife. I would also like to point out that this is a debate about polling, history and elections, not science, so your attempts to drag the latter into this make you look ignorant about science as well as Crimea.

&gt; Let me guess; Putin was elected in Chechnya with 99% support, right? And Kim Jong Un as well? And all these petty dictators all around the world have /r/Nemo84 support because, hey, there were referendums and, even though a referendum may be faked, it's still somehow legitimate. Because you really like Putin.

A sad little rant is not an argument, nor proof. Also, a brief view of my posting history will prove quite conclusively that I certainly do not like Putin. However, since unlike you I remain neutral and objective on this issue, disliking one side does not mean I must automatically like the other side, or vice versa. Nor should it mean I must twist and turn reality until it fits my bias and prejudices.

&gt; But you haven't done the most important thing; prove there isn't a teapot circling the globe right now, please. You keep ignoring my request, and I don't understand why.

[And once again, here is one main part of that proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_status_referendum,_2014#Polling). And now you can happily continue ignoring it, like the good little brainless shill you are.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Will not work. Syriza has the advantage that large parts of the Greek voters are living in a fantasy world where you can combine global capitalism with national socialism. Sorry, you have to choose one. 

If you are pro-Free Trade, pro-EU, etc. you are putting the nation in a situation where its economy can only prosper if it is globally ""competitive"", and that means being attractive to global migratory capital. And that force does not like leftist policies. The establishment social democrats/socialists are not lying when they say ""there is no alternative"" to their neoliberal policies, if you want to compete against everyone from Poland to China there is little room for taxes on capital and worker rights. Globalization is a race to the bottom for those whose skills are not in high demand and who can easily be replaced by migrant laborers from poorer countries.

That is why the Front National utterly dominates the ethnic French working class vote these days. You might argue that the re-nationalization / re-regionalisation of the economy promised by the FN would make things even worse, but the losers of global capitalism have little to lose and the present system offers no positive future for them, so they are willing to take the risk.

Globalist leftism is dead, get over it. Pretty much all left-wing parties actually successful among the people whose interests they claim to represent are nationalists/regionalists, and that covers the whole spectrum from Morales in Boliva to the Danish People's Party.
 
Except for the restrictions on policy forced by the need to be ""competitive"" there is also the issue of Third World migrants, who are dropped into the lower income neighborhoods were the people have to suffer the consequences. 

You know the secret of not being a ""bigot"" is living a sheltered life far away from the typical African/Arab/Pakistani/etc. migrant. I mean, I am sure the Kemalist aristocrat brat in your private school, whose family owns an entire city back home in Turkey, is a nice kid and just like you. 

This is another reason for the relative strength of Syriza compared to other Euro-leftist parties by the way. They actually do address the (massive) problems caused by all the Third World migrants in Greece.. in a very cynic, very politically correct way. Syriza's plan is to give all the Africans/Arabs/etc. stuck in Greece right now papers so that they can legally move to the UK/Germany/Sweden i.e. there they wanted to go to begin with.

These people do not want to escape war in their home countries, they could have just gone to a neighboring safe country in that case. Nor do they just want to go to ""Europe"" to enjoy ""freedom"". They do not want to be in Greece, and they certainly do not want to go to Poland or Romania. They want to go where the generous welfare states are, where you get housing, food, medical care, money.. all ""for free"" (at the cost of the tax payers actually). They are chasing the money.. which should not be surprising given that this is what humans commonly do.

So Syriza has a unique advantage there, being able to be good leftists and cleaning their country of troublesome Third Worlders at the same time. The French left has no such option.

&gt;  Eine marxistische Parole gefüllt mit rechtem Gedankengut , ein Klassiker der Querfront-Ideologie. Einer der bekanntesten Querfrontler in Deutschland ist Horst Mahler.

Logical fallacy, im prinzip eine Variante der reductio ad hitlerum. ""Viele Linksalternative sind Vegetarier. Hitler war auch Vegetarier"". 

&gt; Was Jürgen Elsässer eigentlich sagte, versuchte er leicht durchschaubar hinter seiner angepassten Rhetorik zu verbergen, 

Entweder Elsässer ist rethorisch deutlich besser geworden, oder du bist leicht zu beeindrucken. Als ich ihn im November 2012 in Berlin einen Tag ertragen musste, war er nur ein unglaublich plumper Selbstdarsteller, der sich im Glanz seiner Gäste sonnte, aber ansonsten nicht wirklich ernstzunehmen war. 

&gt; Große weiß-blaue Israel-Fahnen flatterten als Zeichen gegen Antisemitismus in den Händen einiger Demonstranten.

Das ist ungefähr so, als würde man die Hakenkreuzfahne als Zeichen gegen Antideutsche verwenden.

&gt; Einige der alkoholisierten Montagsverschwörer und Elsässer-Anhänger schien die argumentative Leere in ihren eigenen Köpfen derart zu frustrieren, dass sie körperlich zum Angriff übergingen.

Oder war es die aktive Beschallung? Es gibt Menschen überall auf der Welt, in allen Bevölkerungsschichten, die ihre körperliche Unversehrtheit gegebenenfalls auch mit Gewalt durchsetzen.

You're using a referendum you have admitted isn't worth the paper its printed on. Any political scientist would laugh at you.

&gt; However, since unlike you I remain neutral and objective

Ahaha.

&gt; Nor should it mean I must twist and turn reality until it fits my bias and prejudices.

Adorable. You believe scientists can be neutral and objective. They're not; that's why the scientific method even exists.

&gt; And once again, here is one main part of that proof[2]  . And now you can happily continue ignoring it, like the good little brainless shill you are.

In scientific papers, you don't see the words ""sad"" or ""shill"" or ""brainless"". Let me tell you; you're not scientifically minded. Neither am I, to be sure, but don't kid yourself.

Did you even read your paragraph?

&gt; Polling by the Razumkov Centre in 2008 found that 63.8% of Crimeans (76% of Russians, 55% of Ukrainians, and 14% of Crimean Tatars, respectively) would like Crimea to secede from Ukraine and join Russia and **53.8% would like to preserve its current status, but with expanded powers and rights. Razumkov characterized Crimeans' views as confused, unsteady, and sometimes contradictory and therefore vulnerable to internal and external influences.[29]**

That's why, in Western democracies (something you think is awful, I'm sure) these things take years, both views get plenty of airtime, and there's lots of time for reflection (eg. Scotland).

Which is a point you never made, and is utterly irrelevant to the voter turnout you did mention. Goalposts keep shifting, it seems. So now you first need to prove that Crimea was militarily occupied. Note that the presence of troops, foreign or not, does not automatically constitute a military occupation, especially not if said troops are present with the consent and support of both the local population and government.

&gt; You're using a referendum you have admitted isn't worth the paper its printed on. Any political scientist would laugh at you.

Again, the only one using the referendum is you. I'm using decades worth of politics and polls.

&gt; Adorable. You believe scientists can be neutral and objective. They're not; that's why the scientific method even exists.

&gt; In scientific papers, you don't see the words ""sad"" or ""shill"" or ""brainless"". Let me tell you; you're not scientifically minded. Neither am I, to be sure, but don't kid yourself.

Again attempting to drag science into something that science cares nothing about. Man, you're pretty much the worst troll ever.

&gt; Did you even read your paragraph?

Yes, that why I noticed the part that said ""2008"" and ""63.8% of Crimeans (76% of Russians, 55% of Ukrainians, and 14% of Crimean Tatars, respectively) would like Crimea to secede from Ukraine and join Russia"". And now go read the actual source for those stats to see why the part you emphasized from the one poll you cherrypicked doesn't mean what you think it means.

&gt; That's why, in Western democracies (something you think is awful, I'm sure) these things take years, both views get plenty of airtime, and there's lots of time for reflection (eg. Scotland).

true,3Nerd,null,null,"**Don't do it.** 

I have studied informatics there. Game development to be precise. My degree is more or less useless. Let me explain why:

The SRH Heidelberg used to be a top university to study informatics at, but in recent years the quality has severely dropped, thanks to the management of the school. Private schools of course want to make as much money as possible, so you would expect them to try to keep quality up, so that they have a good reputation and that more people want to go there. 

This is not the case here. Since a lot of young people want to get into game development, that course get's flooded with students. Which means, they can cut down on the quality, without losing students, since so many people want to get in.

Most of the professors and training staff suck at teaching. Partly out of lazyness, partly out of incompetence. 

It's really easy to coast through the courses, since it's an open secret, that *nobody* fails a class. Which is great for the lazy students, but bad for those who actually put in the effort. And it's really demotivating when you work your ass off to keep a deadline and while you hand your paper in, some other dude waltzes in and gets a 2 day extension just for asking.  

Thanks to this, over the last couple years the SRH has been handing out diplomas like candy. 

When the people who got good grades without actually trying started to apply for jobs, word in the industry spread really fast that the degrees are a joke. Having a diploma from the SRH while applying in the games industry is a huge red flag for most companies now.

*Only exception is the course for Medieninformatik (Media Informatics). Because the professor that is in charge of that actually is competent and gives a crap.*

So again, don't go there. The quality has dropped like crazy in the last couple of years. Save your money. And yes, I am a bit bitter about this :/",0,1402518360,null,0,false,0,ci53759,t3_27vk1o,t1_ci53759,t3_27vk1o,null,1434196337,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

true,Glenn2000,null,null,"I find this article pretty lacking. For starters, ""only"" 8-9% voted for the right-wing alternative in the EU election. That percentage will probably be lower in the national elections in September, because they mobilized heavily in the EU election. 

Second, they are most likely racists by all measures, yes, but they are not nazis like front national or golden dawn (we have that too, but they're too small to register in proper elections). What I perceive Sverigedemokraterna to want is to heavily limit / stop immigration for a while and subsidize people who want to return more (something we already do). 

The author furthermore does not even mention the special status asylum seekers have in Sweden which include full access to social services, health care, retroactive child payments and parental leave, free dental care (something swedish people doesnt even have) etc etc. 

A flat in Tensta, Rinkeby or the other suburbs are not necessarily cheaper than elsewhere, it is however probably easier to get because racism (tm). But on the other hand its not the building owners job to introduce asylum seekers to swedish society by proxy via problems that comes with workless (non worker-immigrants have terrible employment stats in sweden), welfare-taking, big families, balblabla. 

In general, there is a huuge disconnect in Sweden between what our politicans think we should do and what the average person on the street really wants. When the immigrants goes to the suburbs far away, the average swede doesnt have to interact with them and the politicans get that jolly feeling of doing good. 

In reality, I doubt its so much racism as social disconnects (religion, culture, food, smell, how you behave) and economic differences. Most middle class doesnt live with poor people either, the colour of their skin makes lesser difference.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; Kids in here complain about how shitty Finland is and how great everything is in place X. (Many times place X being the US.)

The problem with most people is if they visit somewhere they forget living there means having a job and doing the mundane things that go along with everyday life. I recently shared a hostel with a Finnish girl who is studying law. She seemed to love everything about the US and she didn't want to go back to Finland and go back to work/school. She wants to move to the US. I told her to always look for a place she thinks she will fit the best, but to remember, she is in a holiday mentality and to remember once she moved to the US she would also have work, and further schooling so she could practice law in the US. 

Personally, I think there is a lot of things the US is great at, and attributes I really like about it. There are things that Scandinavia dos really well, and good attributes that are fairly uniform there. 

For instance I love living in Chicago. I know the city well enough it does not feel big anymore. I am not sure I'd like living in a smaller place, so that would really limit me to a couple metros in Europe. On the flip side, a Swiss student doing a year at my school thought Chicago was too big (and oddly enough, she said it was too expensive), same with my friend's German wife. 

Its all a balancing act. Some places will be a better fit for some people and not a good fit for others. Like I said above, I will always endorse this discovery process to find something that makes someone happy. But often I see people with blind adoration for a place, or looking at a potential place to live through a holiday lens.

Funny, here in Germany the political establishment agrees that low birth rates are an utter disaster and will cause nothing less than the collapse of the economy if not addressed. Now we are talking about a green-left establishment so their primary solution is importing lots of foreigners. Really, I hear that - ""So few German children! We need more immigrants!"" - in our media all the time. 

And again the establishment is right if you accept the precondition of global capitalism. That system does not work if there are many retired old people on one hand, and few tax paying workers on the other. Because who is going to provide for all the pensioners? You cannot just increase the taxes on the billion dollar profits of the large corporations, using the profits of the productivity gains of automation and globalization to pay for the increased number of pensioners, they would just run away, taking their capital with them. So what can the national state do within that framework? Tax the middle class even more? There are limits even there. No, they are right about the demographic imbalance being a critical problem which must be addressed - in some way. And given that abandoning global capitalism is out of the picture that only leaves  ""more native children"" and/or ""more immigrants"".

They're degrading the common gene pool of humanity. We overrule free choice when it damages common interests all the time. Why not here?

&gt; Also: Most birth defects aren't genetic, so any offspring they do have are unlikely to have the same problem.

The phrase ""inheritable diseases"" exists, so there's a fair number of them, event with our limited knowledge, so that's not an issue. But they might just as well hidden benefits as they might just be lifting along on the success of other genes.

&gt;""Weeding them out"" would just deprive the population of a diverse individual, and reducing diversity reduces evolvability (humans out of Africa are already shockingly similar, genetically)

That's besides the point if you never allow selection to happen and are going to prop up *any* kind of diversity. At that point it's irrelevant.

&gt;Eugenics is shooting ourselves in the foot when it comes to long-term survival of the species.

I agree, althought mostly because of the reason that we can't predict the future.

&gt;And the cattle example is an example of how eugenics can cause harm, because they're not naturally evolved to be that way. Wild cattle manage just fine, you see.

*Because they're allowed to die if they're unfit.* We don't let people die if they're genetically weak at some point. For good reason, of course, but it might have a long-term drawback.

true,xaserite,GERM,Deutschland,"&gt; Man nimmt ja immerhin die Nichtexistenz an

Falsch. *Gott spielt keine Rolle* in den anerkannten Theorien, welche die Grundsteine der Materie und der Herkunft des Universums erklaeren. Die Theorien **funktionieren unabhaengig** von der Existenz eines Gottes. Notwendigerweise kann diese Annahme auch nicht enthalten sein. 

Nochmals. Occam's Klinge. Wir nehmen ja auch nicht an, dass keine unsichtbaren, fliegenden Einhoerner, deren Maehne, Horn, Schweif und Urin regenbogenfarbig sind, existieren. Die Annahme bringt keinen Nutzen. Eine Welt, in welcher sie existieren, ihr Verhalten aber dem der Nichtexistens gleicht, ist gleich zu einer Welt, in der sie nicht existieren [Identitaet].

&gt; Welchen Sinn hätte diese Diskussion und überhaupt alle, wenn der Naturalismus wahr wäre und unser Denken nur ein biochemischer Prozess gebunden an Naturgesetze wäre?

Von welcher Definition von Naturalismus sprichst du? So wie der Begriff definiert ist, spricht man von einer Philosphie, einer Denkweise. Die Eigenschaften 'wahr' oder 'unwahr' finden hier einfach keine Verwendung.

So weit wir wissen, ist unser Denken an das Hirn gebunden. All das, was Hirnforscher sehen, ist tatsaechlich ein biochemischer Prozess, den wir prinzipiell mit Hilfe der Naturwissenschaften beschreiben koennen. Ich weiss nicht, welchen Punkt du hier kritisieren moechtest. 

Willst du eine uebernatuerliche Mechanik invokieren? Dann mach doch bitte erst deine Hausaufgaben, und zeige, dass diese existiert. Denn momentan deutet sich hier wieder nur das *argumentum ad kensoquentiam* an, wenn du auf die **Sinnfrage** anspielst.

Da kommt auch die so entscheidende Annahme (?) ins Spiel, dass das Leben ohne eine uebernatuerliche, leitende Macht keinerlei Sinn inne hat. Nun muss ich wirklich ganz unschuldig und hintergedankenlos fragen, wie du - erstens - darauf kommst und - zweitens - was denn ueberhaupt Sinn deiner Meinung nach ist. 

Zu guter Letzt - zum **Zufall**: 

&gt; Die Frage ist, ob Zufall wirklich die einfachste Theorie für die Erklärung der Welt ist.

Wie *definierst* du Zufall? Mir als Mathematiker scheint der Begriff am sinnvollsten mit dem *Mangel an Information ueber ein System* ueberein zu kommen. Das macht die zitierte Aussage tautologisch. Was verstehst du also unter Zufall? Dass 'Gott wuerfelt'?

he is probably the most hated sultan. because of his spy network and jailing a lot of people and thus creating paranoia &amp; fear (and probably he downright looked mean :p). 

but i would claim that this guy is the most underrated one. everyone likes the monarchs from the glory days: suleiman i, mehmed ii, bayezid i, selim i etc. those were dwarfs on a hill whereas abdul hamid ii was the giant in a pit.

the guy basically managed to hold the empire against a downfall during a rapidly decelerating time when the ottomans were thought of already finished. he was a modernist sultan. many of the modern turkish institutions have their roots from his time. some of the things he did:

* made the hejaz railway (some parts today still used)
* opened ziraat bank (exists today)
* brought the industrial scale printing presses. had made some 6000 books translated.
* brought electricity and telephone
* opened textile and paper factories
* opened modern pharmacies
* opened many schools and some universities
* opened archaeology museums

true,Mrs_ThinkTank_Fairy,FRAN,France,"there are pros and cons, his legacy is positive though.

As someone mentioned, France became a superpower during the Sun King's rule. France's great hard power at the time had many sources: population, wealth, technological edge, overseas colonies as well as decisive leadership. However, France's simultaneous ascendancy to *soft superpower* status can almost be total contributed to the Sun King... sure France had a great cultural tradition but Louis XIV pumped steroids into this tradition (ex: the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles and just as importantly, the glam-charged ""Fashion of the Sun Kings Court"")

Monarchs throughout Europe wanted to emulate the ritz and dazzle that Louis XIV created- the Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Wittelsbachers, Romanovs and many others that simply could not afford to even come close to the splendor of the Sun King. As you may imagine, this had a tremendous diplomatic effect. 

The combination of military might and royal splendor gave the impression that the Sun King of France was a being of immense superiority, over his subjects, the subjects of of other European realms and the sovereigns of other European realms. [For example, if he were alive today Louis XIV would enthusiastically pull this kind of stunt](http://i.imgur.com/R5hl789.jpg)

Louis XIV was not without flaws, it could be argued that the Sun King set a standard for royal extravagance that his successors were to weak to sustainably maintain. 

Another huge criticism of Louis XIV was that he stripped French Protestants of their rights by revoking the Edict of Nantes. As a result a massive French Protestants fled France and France experienced a heavy brain drain, since many Protestants had dedicated themselves to business and finance.

Now that they're in power, it's not working anymore, because they have a chance to actually implement policies and they just have to figure out which.

Dividing the party had been called for, but it wouldn't work. The left would join the front de gauche and the greens, who are just as divided internally, incompetent and ultimately out of touch with voters.

Certo, tu dici, uno fa la scientifico, cazzo gli serve il latino? Il fatto è che uno, a scuola, non dovrebbe fare solo per fare.Mi spiego meglio. La scuola dovrebbe essere (ma non è, a conti fatti, almeno in Italia) una piattaforma da cui saltare verso il magico mondo della cultura. Pensa se chi facesse un lavoro sapesse roba solo di quello che si occupa. Un po' come se io che studio legge prima di andare a dormire mi mettessi lì a leggere il codice civile tutte le sere o la costituzione. Se tu fai il biologo non è che per forza devi leggere solo cose di biologia e così via: aprire la mente ad altre possibilità dovrebbe essere il bello di essere umani: la libertà di scegliere quello che più ti piace. Poi, per carità, sono d'accordo sul fatto che sto latino allo scientifico sia fatto col culo però questo è un discorso di serietà, spesso assente, nei docenti. per dire, anche io al classico ho fatto chimica e biologia (il corrispettivo del latino da voi). Che pensi che mi serva adesso? Quanto pensi che abbia imparato? Io ben poco, è stata fatta col culo, ma c'è gente che era con me e che adesso fa matematica fisica chimica biologia e medicina. Poi, chi sceglie di intraprendere successivamente una carriera umanistica garda che sa benissimo di andare incontro a delle grane, mica tutti scemi eh! Però, molto semplicemente, non è che sono tutti fancazzisti, solo hanno scelto di fare volentieri ciò che gli piace, non malvolentieri ciò che forse avrebbe loro fatto guadagnare di più. Come già ha detto qualcuno, perchè rimuovere? Aggiungiamo ore alleggerendo il carico (immenso e ingiustificato a mio avviso) di lavoro e studio a casa, diamo più spazio a ricerca e applicazione pratoca anche allo scientifico.

true,intangible-tangerine,UKGB,United Kingdom,"King Alfred, Anglo-Saxon King of Wessex. 

Churchill called him the Greatest English man who ever lived. 

Charles Dickens wrote of him: 

""The noble king ... in his single person, possessed all the Saxon virtues. Whom misfortune could not subdue, whom prosperity could not spoil, whose perseverance, nothing could shake. Who was hopeful in defeat, and generous in success. Who loved justice, freedom, truth and knowledge.""

He defended Wessex from the Vikings thereby ensuring the survival of English culture. He didn't ever give up even when he was reduced to fighting a guerilla campaign with a small band of loyal followers in the West country marshes.  

Once Wessex was secure he liberated other areas from Viking control and began the process of creating a united England which his dynasty would rule over. 

He was wise in victory and sought terms that would ensure peace, after the battle of Edington he convinced the Danish King Guthrum to adopt an Anglo-Saxon model of Kingship which involved respecting peace treaties and the border set up by the DaneLaw agreement. 

He reorganised the defences of his Kingdom, setting up fortress towns, building up the navy to be a significant force and funding the military through taxation. 

He cared for the welfare and education of his people, he personally translated works from Latin in to Anglo-Saxon so that his subjects could have access to them. He created a new law code which, although cumbersome and not very practical, did have as its founding principles mercy and equality of justice. 

If all he'd done was to ensure the survival of Wessex he'd be a candidate for England's greatest King, the fact that he did that and then went on to improve so much else about the society he reigned over is just remarkable. He's one of those characters in history who's just a force for good, it didn't matter if he was on the cusp of losing his entire Kingdom or if he was ruling securely - he was always principled and always stood on the side of virtue.

Yes, it is explicitly not it's job. That is a major part of the problem. There are few macro economic devises to balance the differences between the countries, particularly Outright Monetary Transactions. 

I would agree with you that neoliberal policies his a great factor in the stagnation, and that looser policy. That is built into the nature of the Euro. Draghi has made a good effort to change this but it may not be enough. 

Still the euro stopped countries preform the levels of quantitative easing that they require to rebalance their economies. I can never seeing Germany agreeing to the levels of devaluation, or OMTs, that Greece needs for instance.

States don't survive indefinitely. But they are reasonably stable over a long period of time. IMO even with the good macro policy the europe economy is still to diverse to be a successful economic device. The drawback are far greater than the advantages. I don't object to it on terms of nationalism, I object to it because it a very poor economic device. It would be much better to unwind the euro amicable. Ireland in particular, do 50% of their trade with the UK, and only 20% with the rest of the EU. Which usually leaves them with an overvalued currency.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; No, i wouldn't say luck alone. Even if you have skills in one area you may not have them in another. Being a good carpenter doesn't help when you start a business in the middle of a recession for example.

And yet that's a good time to start a business because the opportunities happen on the upswing. But it's besides the point: we could make a list of all the useful qualities of an entrepreneur, and we'll still find that some of these people succeed, and others don't. The difference is luck.

&gt;So what do you suggest?

That we find ways to supply the same opportunities to all sizes of entrepreneurs (eg. access to capital and networks). In addition that we reduce the transfers from startups to the establishment (eg. in the form of interest:-.

&gt;Established corporations growing bigger is absolutely something that benefits the majority of people.

If we have a business and you get 1% of the profit and I get 99%, we can still say that everyone benefits from our profit, but obviously the distribution isn't what it should be.

&gt;Tax revenues go up as well as employment.

The bigger the company, the lower the taxes paid among other things because of their bargaining position. They're also quicker to leave in comparison with smaller companies.

&gt;Despite what you think it's not all about money. Schools like Harvard and MIT are free for people with low incomes and good grades.

I'll acknowledge that on occasion someone gets through. The situation can be and should be improved though.

&gt;Because when you run a successful business you get in touch with a lot of important people.

It's too hard to get noticed in comparison with those born with the contacts. Everyone should be held to the same standards of success to get these contacts.

&gt;Schools and internships are also good ways to get contacts if you are not of the wealthier kind.

That's really not going to help you reach the top. Get a common job, at most, and not even that most of the time.

&gt;I am really curious on how you are planning for this to work.

Yeah, me too. I don't have a program to push but I think it's necessary.

&gt;So what you are saying is that if you got to choose between a job that paid 10 million, you would choose it over a job that paid 11 million? I highly doubt that most people would do it. People much prefer the higher number, it's natural.

Of course, but it's all relative. There's not reason for it to be so high in absolute terms. The problem is just that the scale gets completely distorted at the extreme end. So we should find a better way to express relative valuation, just like we use integrals to sum up certain curves rather than endless sums. We're using the wrong tools.

&gt;I don't blame them, but you can't go around and blame everything around you.

But neither can you always take the blame upon yourself, lest you be played for a fool. Situations where the problem can be put in the shoes of one party exclusively are rare. The difference is that people who sabotage themselves will realize it themselves sooner or later, but the ones who are hindered by others can't always redress that injustice themselves.

&gt;In western countries however, everything is set up for you in life. If you want to succeed, there is not much stopping you.

There's always a biggest problem, naturally. The fact that we reduced the death toll of the most important cause of death of last century, shouldn't stop us from working on cancer of cardiovascular diseases now. Likewise nothing should stop us from trying to remove the barriers to success that exist now, even if eg. illiteracy is no longer an issue.

&gt;Which is why public services in western countries are either free or subsidized so that everyone can succeed.

Exactly, and that worked well. So I see no reason not to try to repeat the success in other areas that are as privileged now as eg. education used to be.",0,1402522374,null,0,false,0,ci5581u,t3_27phvm,t1_ci5581u,t1_ci4qt7j,null,1434197356,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,PressureCereal,ITAL,Italy,"Good for you for being consistent. I am very much in agreement with the general argument for independence and self-governance, and my natural impulse is to say of course, any number of regions should hold referenda and if they so decide, secede or become autonomous or any other degree of independence they want. However (as a kind of political sciences exercise) I also like to consider what the effects of this course of action are in the long run, not in the case of Italy or Spain or the UK, but in general.  

Vis-a-vis, if you provide every region with the chance to determine whether they would like to be self-governed, some will take that chance and some will not. Therefore in such a hypothetical scenario countries will naturally fracture into smaller constituent states with varying degrees of autonomy. That state of affairs runs counter to my feeling that humanity must eventually transcend its tribal concept of nations and archaic us-versus-them ideologies and emerge united, not to mention anything about any adverse socio-economic effects of secession. 

It's an interesting question with no clear answer, but I find it hard to argue with those who advocate cohesion not because they are against the right to self-governance, but because they think it provides clear social and economic benefits to everyone involved.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; The Scottish economy is overly reliant on volatile oil markets and after that it's pretty much all services.

The Scottish economy is [slightly more diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland) than that.

Oil made up about 11% of public sector revenue last year; historically it's around 18%, or [around £10bn](http://scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00415871.pdf). By way of comparison, tourism brings in [about £11bn](http://www.visitscotland.org/what_we_do/deliveringforscotland.aspx) while food+drink exports [are £13bn](http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Food-drink-success-3ee.aspx).

&gt; For us to continue to fund the welfare state we will have to raise taxes considerably to rates similar to Norway - 30% to 45%.

Scotland's spending on welfare is entirely funded by the block grant (Scotland contributes all of its tax revenue to the UK Treasury, once a year the UK Treasury issues a lump sum back).

Scotland is currently running a deficit, by spending more than we earn, but then so is the UK. In [2012-2013](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0044/00446179.pdf) Scotland's deficit was £8.6bn (5.9% of GDP), compared with £92bn (5.8% of GDP) for the UK as a whole.

That's by no means out of line [with other countries](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/government-deficit_gov-dfct-table-en). Where did you get the figure for a 30-45% raise in taxes from?

&gt;There is also no clear indication of what currency will be used. Our budget deficit is too high for the Euro, so it's either a reversal on us being allowed to use the pound or a new currency. If we choose the pound we cede control to the BoE.

Our budget deficit does take us (and the UK) above the 3-3.5% criteria for the Euro, but more significantly in the short term would be that two years membership of ERM III are also required.

That said, which currency we would use is perfectly clear - it would be sterling.

The only question is if there would be a formal currency union with the UK. The UK government currently says no, but ""[cast-iron guarantees](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/04/david-cameron-referendum-campaign-over)"" have been made and broken before. I suspect that, in the event of a yes vote, the objections in principle will be replaced with some kind of ""advisory board"" hand-waving and a longer timetable for the removal of Trident.

""Ceding control"" to the BoE means giving up control over interest rates and the money supply (the value of sterling). This is essentially the same as all Eurozone states do with respect to the ECB, but that aside it's difficult to see a scenario where the BoE could implement policies that would be bad for Scotland without also having adverse consequences for rUK. 15% interest rates would be difficult for Scotland, but they'd be difficult for rUK too.

&gt; EU membership isn't guaranteed either, however likely and frankly I see people voting Yes to ""stay"" in the EU out of fear of UKIP to simply be cowards.

I don't think concern over the UK's pledge to hold an in-or-out referendum over the EU is cowardice: the Conservatives have committed to one, Labour is under pressure to, and both Conservatives and Labour are feeling the squeeze from UKIP.

It's true that EU membership ""isn't guaranteed"". But given that there's no political appetite in Scotland for leaving the EU the question really comes down to what the EU accession process would be, rather than any real doubt that Scotland would (continue to) be part of the EU.

The scenario that's often touted is that Scotland would have to leave the UK (and hence the EU) before it could even consider applying to the EU. There's very little evidence to support that - there is no precedent for a country within an EU member state having an amicable separation from its parent state while wishing to continue to participate in the EU.

IMO, the most likely solution is one that keeps the EU together (secession from the UK and accession to the UK on the same day), not one that temporarily ejects part of it only to welcome it back in again shortly afterwards. Who would benefit from temporarily removing Scotland from the EU?

&gt;The far right will be beaten once more and frankly they have support up here too.

That's true - UKIP did receive about 10% of the vote in Scotland in the recent Euro elections. Then again they received 27% of the vote in England, so I think there is a difference in the level of support they have.

&gt;And that's it really. I would have voted the other way for a lot of other reasons and the lack of solid evidence that we couldn't do it economically. Now it just seems like many are saying (and have to me) ""I don't care how bad it is, I'm done with this union.""

My own decision to vote yes is based much more on wanting new opportunities for Scotland in the future.

I don't think there's any evidence to support the idea that Scotland will turn into some kind of failed state. There would certainly be challenges, but about 40% of the other countries in the EU are Scotland's size or smaller and they manage.

&gt; I try and not argue about it anymore but I always get roped in.

This is simply not true. In fact, British pilots had a better recovery rate than their opponents. For example, unsurprisingly enough, if you got shot down over Britain you're not stuck in foreign soil. Britain (and later the US) also implemented a different system to the Axis in regards to experienced pilots where new ones were trained by aces (by contrast, Axis aces were generally kept in constant service: great for propaganda via legendary air scores, but worse for replacing losses with suitable new pilots).

Here's a neat documentary on how close each side was to 'winning' the BoB. I recommend that you watch it if you are interested in learning more on the subject (most details on the subject of losses are about 38 minutes in):

Also worth noting that I would have been hesitant to give the Kriegsmarine surface vessels good chances against the Royal Navy en-masse (exactly why gaining air dominance was so vital in the first place). Their ability to sneak attack merchant shipping wasn't the only good reason that they kept to U-boats whereas the RN arguably possessed surface dominance throughout.

&gt; What's the etiquette regarding tipping in restaurants? I know that in some countries it's optional, in others mandatory and in some it is considered rude to tip. So when I eat in a restaurant in France, should I give a tip? How much do I usually need to tip?

Tipping is completely optional in France (service is included). If you have a very good experience, you may give a tip, but that's not expected nor frequent.

&gt; Do most people in France speak English as well, or should I buy a phrase-book?

Most people don't speak English, but the proportion of English speakers is not that bad, and you should always find somebody to help you if needed. There shouldn't be any problem in airports, train stations, hotels, tourism offices, etc.

That said, you will probably meet people who don't speak English. In addition, I think it is quite rude to start adressing somebody in English (except at airports, hotels, etc.). At the bare minimum, learn a few convenient sentences (""Bonjour"", ""Excusez-moi"", ""Parlez-vous Anglais ?"", ""Merci"", ""Au revoir""...). The idea is to start the conversation in French, ask if they speak English, and if they do, switch to English.

In short: a short phrase-book is not mandatory, but advised.

&gt; Is there any place in the Strasbourg area that is a must-see?

The cathedral?

I'm not against giving advice, but I'm not here to organize a trip. Look for a guide or go to the tourism office. If you are looking for something more precise, I'm sure some people will be glad to answer.

&gt; I heard there's a food car in TGV trains. Should I trust it to provide something edible (even if expensive) or would it be better if I buy something to eat in the airport beforehand?

As far as possible, avoid the SNCF food cars: the prices are horrible, and the food isn't great (although it's edible). Train stations are no better (well, some of them are not that bad, but that's rare, and in Paris they are worse than the TGV. In Strasbourg, it's decent, but not great.).

Where are you getting such wild figures?  Not even the NO side have produced figures like 45% tax (and for what income bracket?  Considering the top rate is already 45% in the UK?).  Scotland contributes 9.9% of UK tax and only gets back 9.3% of UK spending and so more than pays its way for the social services it enjoys.

&gt;There is also no clear indication of what currency will be used.
&gt;so it's either a reversal on us being allowed to use the pound

The £!  It's freely tradeable.  You don't think someone's going to go into your wallet and remove anything with the queen's face on it do you?  No one *allows* you to use the pound.  I can go into any exchange and walk out with all the pound notes I want and spend them how I like.  A formal *currency union* on the other hand is a different matter, but you must know that.  It's such an easy and obvious distinction that I genuinely find it difficult to believe that anyone claiming not to know the difference at this point in the debate is trolling me.

&gt;if we choose the pound we cede control to the BoE.

Over interest rates which is, remarkably, the current system we enjoy!  The BoE already has control over our interest rates and they make decisions based on what's best for the City and the South East, not the North, not Wales, not NI and certainly not Scotland.

&gt;EU membership isn't guaranteed either, however likely

Consider the alternative.  Rounding up the tens of thousands of EU citizens currently in Scotland and forceably deporting them.  Removing the largest source of oil and gas from the free trade zone.  Killing businesses throughout Europe that rely on Scotland.  There is no precedent (let alone a procedure) for kicking a country out of the EU and stripping citizens of EU citizenship against their will.

Do you know how long it took East Germany to gain membership after the wall came down?  A phone call.

&gt;and frankly I see people voting Yes to ""stay"" in the EU out of fear of UKIP to simply be cowards.

With an In/Out referendum now on the table and with public support for the EU consistently below 50% there is a real and present danger of the UK public voting to leave the EU.

&gt;The far right will be beaten once more

UKIP have already won as the tories are now catering to them to avoid a split vote come 2015

&gt;and frankly they have support up here too.

There are nutters everywhere but a party that came 1st in England and 4th in Scotland clearly does not enjoy similar levels of support across the border.  Had the SNP vote not been split with the greens UKIP wouldn't have even got their single seat in Scotland.

That is a bit unfair to exclude people who used financial backers. All businesses need money to get started. For many, venture capital is where they turn. Just because people get financing from wealthy individuals does not mean they are not successful business people. My aunt was not born wealthy, not by a long shot. Because of that she had to look for different sources of financing for her business. She just secured $2 million in venture financing. I certainly would not say you can exclude all of her efforts because she obtained financing from a rich individual as opposed to a bank or capital markets. Venture capital is just another tool in an entrepreneur's tool kit, I dont see why it should be treated differently than any source of funds. 

Obviously this is anecdotal, but out of the people I know that would be considered rich, the vast majority earned it (typically by starting a business).

Moins de dossiers, moins d'analyses variées, souvent un seul point de vue sur telle ou telle question, alors qu'auparavant on avait le droit à une ribambade d'auteurs de pays différent pour chaque continent ! Et à chaque fois un beau dossier ""ce que les autres pensent de la France"" s'étalant sur des pages et des pages, nous donnant un point de vue, un avis, un éclairage différent et donc une façon de les choses différentes de nos journaux français traditionnels !

Alors qu'aujourd'hui il y a un, parfois deux, pays représenté par continent, sur des articles de plus en plus courts... Et le dossier consacré à la France n'existe quasiment plus.

Ich möchte die Texte „Unsere wunderbare Welt“ und „Die Berliner Mauer“  aus „Einfach Deutsch 2“ präsentieren. „Unsere wunderbare Welt“ handelt von Sehenswürdigkeiten wie dem Grand Canyon, den Pyramiden von Gizeh,  dem Taj Mahal, dem Hunderwasserhaus und dem nationalen Straßennetz der Schweiz.

Grand Canyon

Viele Menschen haben den Grand Canyon schon auf Fotos und Filmen gesehen, aber um zu begreifen wie fantastisch und großartig der Grand Canyon eigentlich ist muss man selbst dort gewesen sein. Der Grand Canyon liegt im Nordwesten Arizonas, und er ist 1800 Meter tief, 30 Kilometer breit und 450 Kilometer lang. Der Grand Canyon ist einer der meistbesuchten Orte in den Vereinigten Staaten.

Pyramiden

Die Pyramiden von Gizeh sind das letzte der sieben Weltwunder das heute noch steht. Der Cheopspyramide ist die höchste Pyramide.  Die Bauart der Pyramide symbolisiert den Wunsch des Pharaos in das Totenreich zu kommen.

Taj Mahal

17 Jahre und 20.000 Handwerker waren nötig  um das Taj Mahal zu errichten. Der Bau wurde 1648 abgeschlossen. Das Taj Mahal ist in Nordindien eine große Touristenattraktion, und ist auch ein beliebtes Ausflugziel für jung verheiratete Paare. Das ganze Gebäude erzählt die Liebesgeschichte des Großmoguls, der es für seine verstorbene Frau bauen lies.

Hundertwasserhaus 

Der bekannte österreichische Künstler Friedensreich Hundertwasser hat bewiesen, dass ein Haus auch ein Kunstwerk sein kann. Das Hundertwasserhaus in Wien ist eines der meistbesuchten Gebäude in Österreich.

Das nationale Straßennetz der Schweiz

Da die Schweiz ein sehr bergiges Land ist, kann auch das Schweizer Straßennetz als eine Sehenswürdigkeit betrachtet werden. Das Straßennetz der Schweiz zieht sich durch weite Täler, über hohe schneebedeckte Berge und durch viele Tunnel. Kann man nicht über einen Berg oder durch ein Tal eine Straße legen muss man einen Tunnel bauen. 

Berliner Mauer

Nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg wurde Deutschland in vier Besatzungszonen geteilt.  Eine amerikanische, eine britische, eine französische und eine sowjetische Zone. Die Hauptstadt, Berlin, wurde auch aufgeteilt. Eine amerikanische, britische und französische Zone im Westen, und eine sowjetischen Zone im Osten. Im Jahr 1949 wurden zwei Staaten aus den vier Zonen gemacht: Die DDR unter sowjetischen Kontrolle und die BRD unter Kontrolle der Alliierten.  Da die USA in West-Berlin Hilfe leistete, ging es den Menschen dort viel besser als denen im Osten. Viele zogen und flohen nach West-Deutschland, weil sie mit der Wirtschaft und der Politik in Ost-Deutschland unzufrieden waren. Dies war ein großes Problem für DDR. Sie verloren viele junge Menschen. Von 1949 bis 1961 flohen mehr als zwei Millionen. Am 13. August  1961 begann die DDR, unter der Leitung von Erich Honecker,  die Grenze in den Westen zu schließen. Sie zogen Stacheldraht durch das Zentrum von Berlin und begannen eine Mauer zu errichten. In ihrer Propaganda sprach die DDR von der Mauer als Antifaschistischen-Schutz. Viele waren immernoch sehr unzufrieden mit der Regierung, sodass mehr und mehr versuchten zu fliehen. Die Grenze wurde streng bewacht. Die Soldaten wurden angewiesen, alle Flüchtlinge zu erschießen. Die Menschen begannen zu demonstrieren und Politiker aus anderen Ländern versuchte die Grenzen zu öffnen. Die DDR-Regierung musste schließlich unter Druck aus der Bevölkerung und dem Ausland einwilligen die Grenze zu öffnen. Die Berliner Mauer fiel am 9. November 1989.

Which means that people having gone through this system actually know how to do a job. When hiring foreign engineers, German companies often complain that they have a theoretical base but don't know how to do the job.

German industry tries to offer a training position to every school leaver. Which means that the vast majority of the population has a solid professional qualification. In many countries, a substantial proportion of school leavers doesn't get a proper professional qualification and academic education is often too theoretical and not well adapted to the needs of the economy. 

A number of neighboring countries use a similar system; however, it may be difficult to implement such a dual system in other countries, which don't have a well developed industrial sector. The system requires that industry is capable of providing quality training and that there is an institution (the chambers of commerce in Germany) which oversees the education, holds examinations, defines job profiles, etc.

I don't understand what you mean by ""having kids be put on different tracks depending on their aptitude in school."" School leavers chose which training they want to do. They do receive counselling in school, but in the end, it is their own choice.

I trained in an industrial company in Germany many years ago. The company accepted about a hundred trainees each year. In addition to the training departments, we went through more than 20 different departments, both offices and shop floors, which gave us a good understanding of how a large industrial company works. Even though I don't work in that profession any longer, this experience has served me well in more than 40 years of professional life because I was familiarized with most aspects of a large industrial company at an early stage.

Sure, so don't mind if I don't take it particularly seriously :)

&gt;Yes, it is explicitly not it's job. That is a major part of the problem. There are few macro economic devises to balance the differences between the countries, particularly Outright Monetary Transactions.

There are options, but one thing is certain: no matter which level of government has to bear the burden of adaptation, you have to give it the tools to do so. If devaluation isn't an option, then you have to go with money creation. And if that isn't an option, then the government level that say those aren't options should bear the responsibility for the political fallout.

&gt;Draghi has made a good effort to change this but it may not be enough.

The bazooka is loaded, they've realized at least that. Now they need to realize that the banks and big companies are sitting on their money for a variety of reasons, so throwing more money their way won't solve the stagnation. If the banks don't do what their job is (bringing money into circulation as lubricant for the economy), then a reform of the banking system is in order.

&gt;Still the euro stopped countries preform the levels of quantitative easing that they require to rebalance their economies. I can never seeing Germany agreeing to the levels of devaluation, or OMTs, that Greece needs for instance.

All we need is for Germans to spend money on themselves instead of sitting on it. That would improve the situation already even without OMT's. All countries have some local imbalances, in Germany as a whole it takes the form of excess money hoarding.

&gt;Even if better macro policy the economies are far too different

I don't think that's necessarily the case. We do need a more robust framework for economic development that allows for more specialization though. But that was the case beforehand: some countries have huge capitals while the rest of the country is comparatively underdeveloped. They also have the problem where the most competitive region sucks up all the talent and investment, and uses it to further its competitive edge, etc. and bloats exponentially. That's a similar problem.

Bottom line, the EU should introduce regionalized differentiation into its decision-making.

true,miramarco,lurker,,"Quante delle cose che impariamo a scuola servono effettivamente? La legge dei gas perfetti? La pace di Lodi? Le categorie kantiane? La donzelletta che vien dalla campagna?

A parte quei pochi contenuti ritenuti basilari per una vita produttiva e ben integrata in società (leggere, scrivere, far di conto e poco più), tutto il resto che viene insegnato a scuola è solo una scusa per inculcare negli studenti certe capacità che servono nella vita adulta.

Uno di questi, ovviamente, è la capacità di impegnarsi a studiare e, più in generale, perseguite un obiettivo imposto da altri – roba che faremo fino alla pensione.

Poi, ci sono capacità specifiche per ciascuna materia. Attraverso la matematica, per esempio, un buon professore dovrebbe insegnare certi metodi di ragionamento (deduzione, ricerca dei controesempi, individuazione di condizioni sufficienti) che si rivelano utili anche in ambiti completamente lontani dalle scienze esatte.

Similmente, non si insegna il latino tanto per insegnare una lingua – tanto varrebbe affiancare un'altra lingua corrente all'inglese, o insegnare il latino ""natura morae"" – quanto per costringere gli studenti a prendere un testo di cui non capiscono nulla e a scomporlo in molecole sempre meno complesse, per capire come si raffrontano l'una alle altre. Il latino insegna l'analisi minuziosa del linguaggio e la sintesi del significato a partire dalle sue componenti; insegna a trattare il discorso come una serie di ruote dentate che si possono smontare e riassemblare in modo da farle funzionare ancora.

C'è poi chi vuole usare giustificazioni più fuffose per convincere gli studenti – ti si apre la mente! sai l'etimologia delle parole! leggi Tertulliano in lingua originale! capisci le iscrizioni della necropoli di Roccacannuccia! – ma temo che non convincano nessuno, neppure sé stessi.",0,1402526649,null,0,false,0,ci576aj,t3_27w7b0,t1_ci576aj,t3_27w7b0,null,1434198276,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

this year we actually celebrate the Karlsyear, a year long celebration of his 1200. year of death. 
What that means: a lot of exhibits and other stuff.

but although Aachen is a beautiful city, you should probably not plan on staying here for more than one night, the city is not that big, and you can see the most important parts in one day.

for food:

there is an expensive ""fast-food"" restaurant called Hans Wurst

https://www.hanswurst.de/

they serve all kind of ""Wurst"" (sausages) in different variations, its not very expensive, but the interior is still very nice, and i only call it a fast-food restaurant because you have to get the food on your own. Since you talked about beer, they also server there own beer in nice mugs, it is pretty good.

Another great place is the Pompös right in the heart of the city, next to the historic Rathaus. Its a potatoe-restaurant, basically serving everything you can imagine made of potatoes.

I just checked some travelling websites, and appereantly a bunch of people made bad experiences at that restaurant, but i have been there 4 times, and it was always great... maybe they changed a lot since those comments...
http://www.yelp.de/biz/pomm-p%C3%B6s-erlebnis-aachen

if you want anything else, go to http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g187367-Aachen_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html or feel free to pm me...

If you come to Aachen, make sure to not only visit the old town, but go to the Lindt-Werksverkauf.
Lindt is one of the biggest German chocolate manufactures, and it is based in Aachen. At the Werksverkauf you are able to buy huge quantities for very little money, since they sell the otherwise expensive chocolate that broke while packing etc. in huge backs. I can only recommend going there, even though it won't help your died.

If you want/need any further information just ask, Aachen is basically straight on your path to Amsterdam, so make sure to check it out, even if you not plan on sleeping here ;)

Il latino è molto più scientifico di quanto tu creda, analizzare una frase in latino è impestato tanto quanto (se non di più, nel mio caso di ex maturo scientifico) analisi. Quindi risulta utile anche nello sviluppo di capacità mentali non indifferenti. Come quando sviluppi una derivata che ti devi fare i giri a pensare a quale metodo usare, così quando vedi tre parole in latino devi pensare alle loro desinenze, cosa potrebbero dire insieme, la concordanza di genere e numero, il tipo di complemento.

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; That we find ways to supply the same opportunities to all sizes of entrepreneurs (eg. access to capital and networks). In addition that we reduce the transfers from startups to the establishment (eg. in the form of interest:-.

It varies a lot from country to country how easy it is to start up a business. Access to venture capital is actually very good in the U.S. In Norway where i live this isn't the case as investors doesn't take as much risk. 

&gt; If we have a business and you get 1% of the profit and I get 99%, we can still say that everyone benefits from our profit, but obviously the distribution isn't what it should be.

The thing is that it is hard to distribute it without being unfair. You have to either seize parts of those profits or tax them harder. Taxing doesn't really do much either since it just means a higher cost for the consumer. Seizing private assets is also not something that's acceptable.

&gt; The bigger the company, the lower the taxes paid among other things because of their bargaining position. They're also quicker to leave in comparison with smaller companies.

It varies a lot from company to company though. Corporate tax in it self is not really that effective. First of all it doesn't really add much tax revenue and also as i mentioned above it only causes higher prices for the consumer. 

&gt; It's too hard to get noticed in comparison with those born with the contacts. Everyone should be held to the same standards of success to get these contacts.

But that isn't a realistic option. Contacts will always matter.

&gt; That's really not going to help you reach the top. Get a common job, at most, and not even that most of the time.

For most people a common job is just what they want. Most people actually don't want to be a CEO or similar. They just want to enjoy a middle class lifestyle.

&gt; Of course, but it's all relative. There's not reason for it to be so high in absolute terms. The problem is just that the scale gets completely distorted at the extreme end. So we should find a better way to express relative valuation, just like we use integrals to sum up certain curves rather than endless sums. We're using the wrong tools.

What tools should we use instead then? Right now there isn't a lot of other things that are more tempting than money. Mostly because money can get you pretty much any other benefit as well.

&gt;  The difference is that people who sabotage themselves will realize it themselves sooner or later, but the ones who are hindered by others can't always redress that injustice themselves.

You got a point, but there is always something you can do. If you are not alone you can do a lot together. Whether this being wanting a higher wage or proper school equipment.

&gt; There's always a biggest problem, naturally. The fact that we reduced the death toll of the most important cause of death of last century, shouldn't stop us from working on cancer of cardiovascular diseases now. Likewise nothing should stop us from trying to remove the barriers to success that exist now, even if eg. illiteracy is no longer an issue.

There is still a lot of research and development going on. I think the biggest change is that most of these things are happening in advanced sectors within medicine and industry. That means that the regular guy doesn't really notice it. It's quite different from 40 years ago when regular household equipment were developing fast.

&gt; Exactly, and that worked well. So I see no reason not to try to repeat the success in other areas that are as privileged now as eg. education used to be.

Very true.

I think this may be part of the perceived failure of Swedish integration policy. From the government side, it's great - SFI is an example that should be copied all over the globe, and the benefits you listed are exactly the kinds of things refugees need to try and get on an equal footing with the locals. 

From society's side, no one seems to want to help them integrate. How can they be expected to mimic local rules and norms, if the locals don't want to have contact with them? Integration doesn't happen by some kind of osmosis, it takes an effort both from the host society, and the new arrivals, to ease the transition, and this kind of lowlevel background racism of Sweden doesn't help, as they get pushed into migrant areas and have more difficult times getting jobs (An Aussie colleague of mine that lived there for a year once said 'It's not the best person for the job, it's the best Swede for the job'). Now, I'm not saying that Swedes should go out of their way and bend over backwards to accommodate the new arrivals, but some effort on their part beyond 'the government will take care of it' is required. 

So many of them have already been accepted, this is the only pragmatic solution for Sweden if it doesn't want to have a permanent, resentful, seething immigrant background underclass.

We all are way too dependent on oil. Look here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_land_model#Real-world_examples


In fact, because of [Peak Oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_Oil), we should better reduce our dependence ASAP. And again, I think the Scottish government will do a better job at reducing it, because reducing the dependence on fossil fuels is in everyones interest except of a few big oil companies which would face lower market prices.

The numbers are a deflection, or, let's be clear, they're a lie. They suggest that these big multi-national companies pay a lower corp tax rate than other companies. As i said, they pay the very same rate. 

The numbers for the multinational companies include monies for which the Irish corp tax rate does NOT apply. 

The problem is not the Irish corp tax rate, it's multinationals' use of transfer pricing (for which they use many different countries) to avoid taxation. It's very, very complex and, in reality, has much, much more to do with US residency rules than Ireland.

Ireland could change its corp tax residency rules (that is if they even differ dramatically from other EU countries in the first place), as an act of good faith (a response to ignorance more like) and nothing would change. 
The only net effect may be Ireland damaging its stable reputation and ability to attract foreign investment, even though this transfer pricing issue has little or nothing to do with these companies coming here in the first place. Ireland may even be forced to increase the corp tax rate, even though, again, this has nothing to do with it either. 

&gt; Now as far as the stuff the EU is now looking into goes...What's your argument? That they shouldn't because it's legal?

What the EU are investigating is completely illegal, but it's only tangentially related to the bigger issue of transfer pricing. It's looking at a specific issue, from i think the 1980's and is focused on whether 'state aid' was used to entice Apple to Ireland.

For vocab not to be a total pain, I've enjoyed babadum.com - it's just a little game, but I've actually learned some words from it so far, which is a welcome surprise.

I can't overstate how good it is to follow through with HP and a dictionary! The hardest part is looking up each word you don't know - it gets exhausting - and there are times when just reading for broad comprehension, rather than scrutinizing every word, is just as helpful. I'm an extremely firm believer in the technique of reading a book that isn't at a super high level, but that you know exceptionally well in English, in your target language. I did this with HP 1-3 in Spanish (I did an exchange year in S America; didn't speak a lick of Spanish prior) as well as HP 7 in Portuguese. I'm now doing HP 7 in German. The translation isn't great (my Swiss bf pokes a lot of fun at it), but I guarantee you'll learn so much, as well as get a rhythm for the language down. You'll also learn useless words like magic wand, and who doesn't want to know that in German?

Like you, I'm also listening to German radio - my comprehension is such that I get most things, but it's great for picking up on key vocab words I haven't stumbled upon yet, or for getting the feeling of how conversational German works, with all its pauses, interjections, etc.

As soon as HP fame reached critical mass around book two, anything after that could have been (and at times was) complete shite, and her already established and fanatic fan base would have eaten it up no matter what. And they did.

I'l grant you she hit critical mass, however books 3 and 4 are wonderfully fun reads for a young adult novel. Again. Young. Adult.
&gt; I honestly refuse to believe that you guys genuinely view her as a great writer. Just fans caught up in the fandom, or people who believe popularity is a measurement for writing ability.

The fact you refuse to think anyone can think she's a good writer in any regard/note makes you sound a little silly. She crafted a wonderful world that millions enjoy, the majority of fans aren't obsessive over the characters but rather the world because it's that enjoyable. 
&gt; Her ability to write has never been considered great by anyone of note. She hooked in kids with an interesting story and had massive advertising and publishing backers to make sure HP became an absolute monster of a franchise, but in absolutely no sense of the word would anyone with any kind of relevant writing background consider her up there with the greats.

Critics who aren't comparing her to Twain tend to realize she's a wonderful children/young adult writer. Comparing the end result publishing success and ignoring the start of 500 prints is ridicilous, your  ignoring the start of the story and pretending she was at the head of a massive campaign from the start to shove harry potter down your throat. 

Lastly, anyone with a relevant writing background WOULD consider her up there with the greats. Because the relevant writing background isn't supremely serious tomes but CHILDREN'S books. ",0,1402546308,null,0,false,0,ci5fc43,t3_27vay7,t1_ci5fc43,t1_ci5e0s5,null,1434202190,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The home page after you logged in does not look very good. The buttons with the curved edges and plain colors does not work well. I know you're trying to fit in with the rest of the site designs, but perhaps consider changing it a little bit, I think the design needs a little help.

The interface for learning new words is great, I love that you have audio for each of the words (that I've seems so far). Pictures and sample sentences are fantastic, it is exactly what you need when trying to memorize vocabulary.

I haven't yet used the review part, but the translate sentences part seems well done, easily understood. The journalling system is well done, and works well, but I would say implement some sort of points system in order to drive users to correcting translations, and putting their own journals higher as a result.

The Statistics section is great, I love to see that sort of stuff. The score that is shown on the Home page has no explanation of why or how it is accumulated, or what it is used for.

One thing I noticed is that what language I could learn seems dependent on what I put in my preferences, even though the site only supports German and English right now.

I haven't yet used the friend system, but seemed adequate from what I saw of it.

One thing I would like to know is about how new words are chosen, you mentioned that it uses the frequency lists, but in what way, does it just start at the number one used word and work its way down? And what list are you using, there doesn't seem to be any information on whether the list is most spoken, written, or used online.

As to what would happen to EU citizens wishing to work in the UK (or indeed UK citizens wishing to work in the EU, or remain there) that would all depend on what was agreed in the negotiations.

Britain has historically had a place on the UN security council but realistically this will put their standing on it into jeopardy. Britain has many different positions on international bodies which help with EU representation in international politics. If the UK is replaced it won't be with another European nation, it will be with an emerging market country and that will vastly reduce Europes clout on international affairs. Also the damage to the UK budget will make them drastically reduce forces to the point where only 3 European members of NATO will be spending above the minimum level on defense. Simply put, a weakened UK will weaken everything it brings to the table in the EU and from defense to positions in international organizations, the UK brings a lot more to the table than most Europeans are willing to admit to.

This has precisely zero substance. Let's say that the EU is overthrown and a revolutionary front assumes control of Europe (and its means of production). The people still live there. The borders are still the same. Yes, the material conditions are near-identical. This doesn't *mean* anything though, because the way it is structured is radically different. It's intellectually dishonest (and / or ignorant) to claim that it was a ""continuation"" of a fucking hereditary autocracy. You don't seem to understand what the word ""Empire"" means.

Rejecting Bolshevism is a bad thing, because in doing that you are endorsing the maintaining of a dictatorial monarchy that completely ravaged anyone not of nobility of a hope of a decent life.

Sweden saw one of the longest times of peace during the 17th century during his realm.

Not just Mexico (with their delicious tacos), we'd be [on a par with Botswana](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scotland-s-credit-will-be-on-par-with-botswana-1-3396159) too! (or Estonia, Slovakia, and Israel - but they don't sound quite as scary)

&gt; Also, leaving a currency union up to chance hoping it's not ""cast-iron"" is a huge gamble. Why would the Tories suddenly change their minds when their opposition to join a monetary union couldn't be stronger and when joining would hurt the UK's credit rating?

I think it's fair to say that both sides are holding their firmest line prior to the referendum itself. Salmond says there will be a currency union, Cameron says there won't be. You're not going to hear anything different from them until after the vote.

If the vote is a yes then I think it's quite likely the story will change. The UK wants Scotland to take its share of the UK's national debt and wants a longer withdrawal programme for Trident. Scotland wants a currency union and has said Trident will be removed ASAP and won't be a bargaining chip.

I think it's pretty clear there's room for manoeuvre on both sides - both will give up some aspect of something they're currently opposed to, because both will benefit from doing so.

&gt; Hasn't the Euro crisis highlighted the dangers of currency unions in the absence of fiscal ones?

No, I don't think so. The Eurozone crisis is primarily about debt, and the fact that stupendously large commercial debt was converted to sovereign debt (plus a whole host of other factors, like Ireland offering ""unlimited"" protection for savings). The same situation could have arisen even if we were still using national currencies.

&gt; By declaring independence and maintaining the pound sterling, Scotland would transfer its entire power to influence monetary policy to England.

By England you mean rUK, and actually the BoE not the UK government (the BoE are legally required to act independently from the UK government. Scotland's influence on them would be minimal, as it is today, as their primary concern will be to act for the benefit of the (r)UK economy.

Al di là delle singole affermazioni, non condivido l'atteggiamento strettamente utilitaristico della questione della formazione che mi sembra trasparire dal tuo post, che è condiviso anche da Moratti/Gelmini/chi per loro.

L'alternativa (cioè insegnare SOLO cose che servono per il lavoro) mi sembra un'ottima strategia per creare ingranaggi non pensanti che devono solo pensare a produrre e basta (ipotesi di gombloddo che non posso dimostrare, ma è frutto di impressione personale).

Inoltre, come è stato già detto, non tutti hanno le idee chiare una volta usciti dalle superiori, e io sono stato fra quelli, quindi è giusto insegnare uno spettro un po' più ampio di conoscenze, in modo da dare un po' più di libertà.

A proposito di idee non chiare: è ancora più facile che un ragazzino uscito dalle medie non abbia le idee chiare e, se inserito in una scuola superiore troppo specializzata, poi non è peggio se cambia idea e si accorge che non era la sua strada?

E questo è quanto accade appunto in Cina e Germania che sono state citate in un altro commento qua.

Quindi, pazienza se hai studiato una cosa che tu nel tuo caso non userai, ma molti dei tuoi compagni di classe (futuri medici, insegnanti, ecc.) magari sì.

true,Laplaisanterie,null,null,"This article, and this ""rating"" of democracies seems kinda weird. First, they say they took in consideration the way state institutions are organized, so how states institution (so the various bodies of representative constituting a parlement or the organisation of the governement, who is the head of state and what kind of power does he held etc.), how is separation of powers, essential in a modern democracy, oganized (legislature, executive, judiciary), what kind of liberties are guaranteed by the constitution etc.

&gt;Consider the power of the French parliament. In a country such as Norway, ranked first, or Australia, ranked sixth, the legislature is the supreme decision-making body. France's legislature, by contrast, is one of the weakest in Europe. Because the president wields huge power, it is difficult for the legislature to shape legislation and hold the government to account.

&gt;The president is elected too, of course, but there is a greater risk of a single decision-maker taking action against citizens' wishes than a legislature composed of hundreds of elected officials, which has its own inherent checks and balances.

BUT they say later in the article that, in the past, France actually was rated as ""a full democracy"" :

&gt;In the first version of the Democracy Index, eight years ago, France was rated as a full democracy. 

Thing is, there wasn't any change, at all, to the way power is distributed between the executive (so mainly the President of the french Republic and the government) and the legislature (so the parliament, Assemblée Nationale and Sénat), in the last 8 years.

So if there wasn't any change, how can they rate France as a ""full democracy"" 8 years ago, but not today ? 
So either they contradict themselves, and the organisation of state institution doesn't really play a role in the rating, OR, the organisation of state institutions in France actually is constitent with what they call "" a full democracy"" OR... it just means that they're not very consistent.

They try to explain later with the distrust of french people of the political world :

&gt;It was downgraded in the third edition, in 2010, due to the decline in public confidence in politicians and because of its low levels of political engagement.

So. Does it mean that the actual real criteria for the rating is public opinion ?",0,1402559953,null,0,1402574498,0,ci5iymn,t3_27y0gj,t1_ci5iymn,t3_27y0gj,null,1434203898,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Even if you are 100% blind to racism (and who is, depending on definition), you will not hire a dark islamic man with zero friends vouching for him who only speaks passable swedish over a white swedish-educated guy. 

There are very rarely any positive news about newly arrived immigrants in Sweden. Possibly its the exceptional kid who succeeds in school against all odds in the semi-ghetto. The take away is ""she/he might end up almost like a normal swede"". 

From every viewpoint, the current policies are fucked up. If you want asylum immigration to work, you need to start to assimilate more. I dont give a fuck if its disrespectful. 

I mean, where do you even start? We have immigrants who believe their social services comes from their home countries, or the UN. We have people who believe you dont have to work in Sweden. We have people who doesnt think Sweden is a good place to live, who think we are racist because Swedes have more money. People who think that sharia would do a better job than the Swedish laws. People who think that if they demonstrate they will get more tax money for their area. I've personally met people abroad who thinks Sweden is a socialist utopia.. It's not and it has never been. 

How can you expect the Swedes to accept people who believe those things? If we cannot even make them understand basic shit like how the swedish economy works, how can we make them understand Swedish society enough for themselves to be accepted?

That's what the Norwegians pay to have their quality of public services, it's not an unreasonable figure and the fact that there's a range on it means it can fall in between. They also pay 18-25% on VAT (from memory) and 8% on transportation.

Perfectly aware it's a floated currency. There is absolutely no point in independence if you cede control to the UK government. Surrendering fiscal control but not keeping policy in line with each other is exactly what killed the Eurozone. It also meant that when Greece and others got in trouble they were at the mercy of the EU central bank. When Germany did well they had to prop up people like Greece. Mark Carney acknowledged this, others have as well, fiscal policy, regulation and so on must be in line for it to work well.

One person. Many others have rejected the claim there could be a currency Union because the United Kingdom wants control of its own currency. My main point however is not about whether there will be a currency union, but that Salmond should not have unilaterally stated it, because it is something that must be negotiated. This was a political move by Salmond and nothing more.

I forgot to add that your employer pays 25% social security tax and 9% health insurance tax. So if your income is 30,000 Kc before taxation, your employer pays 40,200 Kc. So your employer pays 40,200 Kc for you and you get only 22,740 Kc, which means you could argue that the tax is effectively about 43%.

true,spid88,emilia-romagna,,"A few corrections.  
  
&gt; Mi chiamo [first name last name]. Il mio compleanno è il 31 gennaio 1994.
  
This is correct but in Italy ""compleanno"" usually refers only to the anniversaries of your birth and not to the day you were born, so you should say ""il mio compleanno è il 31 gennaio"", without specifying a year(as it it a recurring event).  
To state the day you were born it's a lot more common to say ""Sono nato il [data]""    
  
&gt;Ho vent'anni. La mia famiglia è **delle** Filippine.  
  
""Viene dalle Filippine"" is also correct, but if you use the verb essere you must follow it with a possessive pronoun in this specific case.  

  
&gt;Non parlo la lingua. Ho un fratellino, [name], e una sorella maggiore, [name]. **Mio** padre si chiama [name] e mia madre si chiama [name]. Mia zia, [name], abita **a** casa mia.
  
The article before ""padre"" is not wrong but it's redundant and usually avoided.  
""In casa mia"" is also technically correct but makes it sound a bit as if your aunt is a pet or a piece of furniture :).   
  
&gt;Viviamo **a** Toronto. Vado all'università di Toronto. **Studio architettura**. 
 
""in"" is used in every case except for cities, which should instead be preceded by ""a"".  (It's not really wrong, it just sounds weird)  
So it's:  
Vivo in Nord America.  
Vivo in Canada.   
Vivo in Ontario.   
But:  
Vivo a Toronto.   
   
&gt;Sono **al** secondo anno di università. Parlo inglese e studio italiano. Vado a lezione **in** autobus e metropolitana. 
  
Alternatively:  
""Prendo l'autobus e la metropolitana per andare a lezione""  
  
&gt;Ci vuola un'ora per arrivarci.  
  
The article ""un"" requires the apostrophe if, and only if, the word that follows is feminine. So:  
Un orologio.  
Un'ora.  
  
&gt;Io studio a casa mia e in biblioteca. Mi piace l'università in estate perché è bello. Non mi piace l'inverno perché è freddo. Ho molti interessi. Mi piace ascoltare la musica. Mi piace mangiare cibo cinese. Mi piace l'arte e l'architettura e mi piace disegnare. Disegno con la matita, la vernice e il computer. 
    
This part is fine, except for the correction already made by iosonouomoragno. 
""Io"" is redundant and can be avoided.  
""Vernice"" usually refers to the kind of paint one applies to walls and the like, in this context the more specific terms should be used, or just say ""pennelli"" (brushes).    
   
  
&gt;Mi piace giocare *ai* videogiochi ed esercitarmi.   
  
It's not necessary to repeat the verb in this case.  Also, ""esercitare"" is transitive, which means it requires an object so you have to specify *what* it is you exercise. In this case it's yourself, indicated by the particle ""mi"".  
""e"" becomes ""ed"" when preceding a word that itself begins with ""e"", but that's simply to make the sentence sound better and to forget it is not a big mistake.  
   
&gt;Posso guidare e indosso lenti a contatto. Voglio andare a New York City e Roma per vedere la loro architettura.
  
Contact lenses is ""lenti a contatto"", but in everyday speech they're often referred to as ""le lenti"". ""Porto le lenti"" is a common way to say it.  
Every other visual implement (goggles, glasses, spectacles...) is simply ""occhiali"".  
  
""To hang out with [someone]"" is simply ""uscire con [qualcuno]"".  It can also be used to say ""To go on a date with [someone]"".   
  
I hope you'll find this useful!

That is why France has a presidential regime, with a very powerful government. The *Président de la république* has a lot of possibilities to do things, with only validation and control afterward by *le Parlement*. That include starting wars, direct diplomatic negotiations, etc.

When we look at other countries, we are often surprised to see that their leaders are unable to act on their own.

Your best chances for a job are teaching kids, privately, but I doubt that can guarantee you a visa, and if you don't know Italian it's going to be very very very hard. You should ask your wife if she knows about any private schools in the area, that is probably your safest bet.

It is.

&gt; And when you mention those places are one bus ride over? where should I look for bus info? I usually use google maps, but it seems to not know how to get there from Strasbourg by public transit.

It's [here](http://www.bas-rhin.fr/transports/reseau-67), in ""lignes touristiques"". In particular:

* Strasbourg -- Obernai -- Mont Sainte-Odile (ligne 257)

* Sélestat -- ... -- Château du Haut-Koenigsbourg (ligne 500)

Unfortunately, the bus to the Haut Koenigsbourg starts from Sélestat and not from Strasbourg, so you would have to take a (short : ~30 min) train from Strasbourg to Sélestat. The buses to the Mont Sainte-Odile mostly leave in the morning.

If it is too far for you, you can try to go to Obernai (by bus or by train). It is a very nice town, and it is closer (45 min by bus). That said, there's already a lot to see in Strasbourg alone...

Your answers were:

The Government should not censor any opinion in any case.

The Church shall finance itself, and be in equal grounds with any other association.

Military service shall be voluntary in case an army exists, and if so, its nature should be limited to its most basic duties of defense.

Laws should not interfere with sex between consenting adults, in no case.

Drugs should be legal, decriminalizing its use and liberalizing its distribution.

The government should not violate any individual right to improve security.

Any imposition or benefit based on criteria of sex, race or social group, violates the principle of equality before the law, and should not be imposed by the Government.

There should be no differences of rights based on the place of birth or one's nationality.

The Government shall not intervene in matters as personal as identity or culture. Every citizen should have the freedom to use any language.

There would be less pollution should clear responsibilities and well-defined property rights with respect to pollution be established.

The Government should not restrict international trade. It must be free and tariffs should be reduced or eliminated.

Taxes should go down, even if that means cutting some benefits and services provided by the State.
Retirement plans are a matter of individual planning and savings. The Government should not require mandatory contributions to a public system.

Private charity should be the main channel for the solidarity of society.

Licenses, permits and professional associations are unnecessary obstacles. The exercise of any profession should be free for anyone qualified.

Labor unions should be governed by the rules applicable to any other association, and no public funding or special functions shall be attributed to them.

The government should not manage medical centers. Medical facilities should be private, and citizens be free to hire the health insurance they wish.

The Central Bank should reduce its powers, and commercial banks shall all be private.

Big stores are businesses like any other. They are entitled to compete freely in the market, with no restrictions on their opening hours or prices.

Employment contracts should enjoy freedom of clauses between parties. Laws should not interfere in purely contractual matters, such as duration or termination causes.

Say you earn **3000** euro a month according to your agreement with your employer.  In Austria you will be paid 12 months + 2 salaries extra to a total of 14.  What you see from these 3000 euros is **1899** euro per month.  **You** are effectively paying **~37%** taxes (at this tax bracket)  which is not at all the highest.  This can get all the way up to 50%.  It's not just that.  You also pay **20%** VAT on top of nearly all the things you buy.

But that's not the end of it.  When you are paid 3000 euro a month, on top of your salary your employer needs to pay money.  A lot.  For the 3000 euro you get (of which you then pay 37% taxes) your employer needs to pay **4593** euro per month.  In that lump of sum is pension, child support money, insurance, highway taxes etc.

In other words: If you get **27502** euro at the end of the year (after paying taxes) your employer needs to pay **55119** euro which means the ""effective taxes"" are **50%** and at that point you're not in the highest tax bracket yet, you're in the 37% tax bracket.

true,bollullos,null,null,"There was a strike by the official taxi union yesterday (Wednesday, June 11) against Uber.

I am 100% in agreement with the Taxi drivers that Uber should not be allowed, but find it very stupid that they strike against it.

I agree with them because Taxi drivers are required to get a license, offer a specific price range, a mininum quality in their service, are subject to regulation and in general work in a strictly regulated framework. I use taxis every now and then, and I am pretty satisfied with the quality of the barcelona taxi service. 

If you start letting anyone sell taxi services without regulation, then there is no point in getting a taxi license. That means no control over quality or quantity of taxis available, less safety in the service, no taxis available on-call on the streets - we forfeit quality in exchange for lesser prices, and I believe that is wrong. In any case, in the current environment where licenses are required and expensive, what uber drivers do is illegal. 

Bear in mind I have nothing against services that promote car sharing, like putting in contact two people that drive daily the same route so they can share expenses. I am against services that let you hire a driver skipping the official channel.

All the above being said, striking against this is about as stupid as it gets. You give uber free advertising. Not only that, you let down taxi users (at least two people I know had a problem yesterday because of the taxi strike). This people now know more about uber, and know how reliable the taxi service is. 

You strike against your employer in tour de force, where the employee loses wages and the employer loses profits until they need to negotiate. You don't strike against your clients in protest for the existance of a competitor, because that is begging them to walk away.

true,iltredici,gamer,,"Allora, dipende cosa intendi per ""giochi di merda"".

Sul piano meramente tecnico molti giochi (esempio più recente su cui abbiamo lavorato: Watchdogs) sono un po' scarsi su tutte le piattaforme perché gli sviluppatori tendono a fare porting di giochi sviluppati per pc sulle console e poi adattano il porting su console nel motore per pc. Sinceramente non so che guadagno ne possano avere, se pratico, economico o semplicemente di tempo. Per quanto ho potuto vedere, uno degli ultimi esempi di ""eccellenza"" (conscio dei suoi difetti) tecnica è stato Wolfenstein: The New Order (anche questo passato di qui): su pc il motore è molto ben ottimizzato e con la macchina giusta si può spingere veramente parecchio, su console ""next""gen il livello è ancora abbastanza alto e piacevolissimo da vedere, su current-gen com'è giusto che sia si sente il peso degli anni della macchina, e quindi la maggior parte dei dettagli grafici è stata sacrificata. Insomma, la via è chiaramente di tenere il gioco a scomparti tecnicamente rigidi e separati, in modo che il gioco non giri ""malino"" su tutto, ma piuttosto malino sulla roba vecchia, normale sulle console nuove, molto bene su PC.

Per quanto riguarda i contenuti penso si scenda nel soggettivo, quindi per rispondere nella maniera più generica possibile: il mercato è saturo di idee ciclate e riciclate, le software house maggiori non se la sentono di rischiare con IP particolarmente nuove e/o innovative, e da qualche anno a questa parte, con la botta promozionale di cui ha giovato il mercato indie, si sono proprio seduti sul trono di bambagia detto ""sequels"" e bòna lì. Và anche detto che ormai le maggiori case sviluppatrici sono aziende enormi che, come tali, preferiscono la stabilità all'innovazione... Speriamo in un improbabilissimo cambio di tendenza.

It is a fun site to use though, and I will be integrating it into my learning.

So, firstly, things I like - I really like the button that says ""Already know it"" - that to me is something so many learning methods lack. I like the theory behind the sentence translation as well - although I think it could be implemented a little better, which I will explain in a moment. I think the journal element is what could really make the site though, if you get a solid base of people using it and making entries in both their native languages and the language they're learning - correcting each others posts and therefore discussing language, grammar and learning process with each other, then you'll have fostered a learning environment which breaks out of the solitary - which is an essential part of language learning.

Now, some points that in my opinion need work. The sentence translation. You have the option to type it, or use ""fridge magnet"" words underneath. I think there should be less options there to begin with. First try to just type it, if you can't then click a button for the ""fridge magnets"" and then try with them, and if you really cant get it, then click a button to reveal the answer. The last point there is very, very important. Having a translation area on your site without a reveal option will cause major frustration for people and ultimately will lead to rage quits.

I'm running low on time here before work so I'll have to complete this post later after I've spent more time on the site.

Before I go - keyboard controls! Multiple choice = 1-9 on the keyboard for quick navigation etc!

Ok, so far, damn good site, will be back on later.

Tegel is small. Really small. It does have its advantages, considering you can litterally be at the gate only 5 minutes after luggage drop off. But yeah, not much space for stores. Tegel also struggles with international flights because of its size. All the passport controls seem rather improvised and are really crammed into that tiny space. Tegel is also built in such a way that every gate (at least in the A terminal) has its own securtiy checkpoint and its own luggae delivery system which makes it quite inefficient. Now take all those factors and consider that Tegel was built to handle 2 million passengers a year. It's doing 10 million right now.

Ihre Spielereien können sie in ihren eigenen vier Wänden wie es ihnen gefällt abhalten, aber nicht in der Öffentlichkeit. Dafür ist die Öffentlichkeit nicht da und insofern muß über solche Lappalien auch gar nicht diskutiert werden. 

Das eigentliche Problem geht viel tiefer: Mit einer Lebenserwartung von weit unter 50 Jahren bemühen sich Obdachlose zwar bereits um ein sozialverträgliches Frühableben, aber bis zu ihrem Tod belasten sie die Sozialkassen. Unnötig, wie mir scheint. 

An der Stelle müssen wir auch selbstkritisch sein und als Gesellschaft zugeben, daß wir von den Obdachlosen bei ihren Sterbebemühungen zwar viel fordern, aber sie vielleicht nicht ausreichend fördern.

Natürlich werden Liberale jetzt einwerfen, daß eine auch eine gesteigerte Förderung problematisch ist, weil nach einer Risikoabwägung nicht gesichert ist, daß das gewünschte Ergebnis eintritt. D.h. die investierten Mittel, z.b. Wasserdüsen, Stacheldraht und Metal-Spikes, könnten sich zumindest in einigen Fällen als Fehlinvestition herausstellen.

Deshalb schlage ich folgendes vor: Der Staat streicht einfach alle Sozialleistungen für Obdachlose und verteilt stattdessen Stricke mit denen sie sich erhängen können. Speziell einzurichtende Suizidämter könnten sogar bestimmte Bäume ausweisen, für deren Benutzung der Obdachlose einen kleinen Obolus abzugeben hat. Die Stricke selbst könnten aus dem biologischen Restinventar der Obdachlosen gewonnen werden.

Man sieht: Mein Vorschlag ist die klassische Win-Win Situation. In der Stadt herrscht Ordnung, die öffentlichen Kassen werden nicht nur entlastet sondern können sogar mit Mehreinnahmen rechnen, und der Obdachlose wird in seinen Bemühung beim Erreichen seines Lebensendziels in der größtmöglichen Art und Weise unterstützt.",0,1402567042,null,0,1402570260,0,ci5k63q,t3_27y9mr,t1_ci5k63q,t3_27y9mr,null,1434204531,27,false,de,t5_22i0,27

Your answers were:

The Government should not censor any opinion in any case.

Government and Church must be separate, but the Government may finance some of the social tasks undertaken by the Church (schools, asylums...)

Military service shall be voluntary. That is the best way to have a professional amry prepared to defend our interests and commitments abroad.

Laws should not interfere with sex between consenting adults, in no case.

The use of some drug currently forbidden shall be legal, although its distribution should be controlled.

The laws and the judiciary should establish in which cases preventive measures go before certain individual rights.

Any imposition or benefit based on criteria of sex, race or social group, violates the principle of equality before the law, and should not be imposed by the Government.

The Government shall regulate immigration to allow necessary immigrants to come in a legal way.

The Government shall protect and / or promote the culture and languge that characterizes its nation.

There would be less pollution should clear responsibilities and well-defined property rights with respect to pollution be established.

The Government should not restrict international trade. It must be free and tariffs should be reduced or eliminated.

Taxes should go down, even if that means cutting some benefits and services provided by the State.

Retirement plans should be guaranteed by the Government, with some kind of mixed model that can combine public and private plans.

The Government shall manage aid and an adequate assistance to the needy, regardless of whether private charitable institutions may voluntarily supplement that.

Professional sectors should be regulated by independent bodies, such as professional associations. Qualified professionals should join them, as their supervision ensures the quality of their services.

The labor unions, as representatives of workers, should have special status on laws regulating labor, but should not be funded by the Government.

The Government should guarantee universal access to health care centers using some sort of public funding.

The Central Bank has a key role regulating the economy, so it must be independent and supervise commercial banks.

Big stores are businesses like any other. They are entitled to compete freely in the market, with no restrictions on their opening hours or prices.

Public / non-profit study organisations. Usually there is a small fee depending on the self inflicted cost of doign something (like a pottery class you would pay for clay or whatever).

1) He talks about the ""rich"" but in Hungary the actually rich people don't pay taxes, they just buy some fake invoices, easy. Out of every 10 BMW's 9 was bought from black or gray money. And as every tax cut and other benefit by the Hungarian government goes to people who do pay taxes, it is a pro-honest policy, not pro-rich policy. And in fact these ""rich"" are middle class e.g. they drive Passats, not Ferraries. The government is simply trying to support those upper-middle class people who pay taxes honestly. If they would be really pro-rich, they would just open more tax loopholes. Because our real rich are always huge tax cheaters. I know it, I grew up in the entrepreneurial (restaurant owners etc.) culture of Budapest, everybody was cheating taxes like crazy. They just buy fake invoices, easy to do.

2) About the poor, well the whole country is poor. Some are just poorer than others. But 95% of people are below a Western standard of comfort and safety. Sure it sucks for the homeless but even a normally employed guy like a taxi driver can hardly afford to rent an apartment.  So young people live with their parents or get illicit income to be able to afford al ife. This country doesn't simply threat the poor poorly - this country _is_ poor, in general.

Open minded, pacific and rational, he promised a Crusade as a kid, but never really wanted to go, seeing it as a barbaric waste of time and money: for this, he managed to get excommunicated 3 times, until he went to the Crusades, but only to negotiate with the Saladin an agreement on Jerusalem which is the basis of today’s religious division of cult places and rituals.

E ti accorgi che tutto quel latino e quel greco difficilmente ti daranno lavoro per due ragioni. La prima è come te ce ne sono a palate e a buttare. La seconda è che, per quanto crudele sia dirlo, non c'è bisogno di un elevato numero di esperti di latino e greco per testi tradotti e ritradotti dall'alba dei tempi. E' un mercato chiuso che alimenta sé stesso, non è che ci sono montagne di testi inediti da scoprire e tradurre. Mi apre la mente? Non è un esclusiva delle traduzioni di latino e greco, molte materie anche più difficili offrono la stessa illuminazione

Di matematici, informatici, fisici, chimici, ce ne sarà sempre bisogno perché sono scienze a potenziale illimitato. Non ci sarà mai un punto di saturazione di queste facoltà, sono scienze che avanzano di pari passo con l'umanità. Per quanto sia importante preservare ciò che abbiamo lasciato dietro, è forse più importante trovare il modo di acquisire nuove conoscenze. 

Senza alcuna offesa verso chi ha trovato la sua passione in materie umanistiche, difendere la loro utilità dicendo che offrono qualcosa che le materie scientifiche non hanno è una bugia.

* An excellent health care system: People in other countries pay **a lot** of money to have the health care you are getting with your taxes and insurance money in Germany. On top of that you get  excellent health care for all the other people around you as well who can not afford it on their own. This means that you live in a healthier and happier society as a whole.
* A comprehensive education program for everyone. Schools are on par with private schools on many other countries. Public Universities are among the best in the world (most are either free or have a very low tuition.)
* Social service programs that take care of orphans, help single moms, keep people away from drugs etc.
* A salary in case you lose your job.
* One of the best systems of public transportation. This ensures wider and faster access to workplaces thereby increasing productivity. Greater decentralization can be achieved like that as well, making your neighborhood more livable (please note that even though you pay a ticket to use public transportation, most systems are still heavily subsidized.)
* Roads that are very safe and good quality. Less people die and people get to places faster.
* A clean environment that your kids will enjoy.
* A military to protect you from the evil French.
* A competent, public safety force (police, fire brigade and civil protection.)

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt;*I know the UK is in talks to hold a referendum,*

&gt;*There's first a decision to hold a referendum,*

At the General Elections:

1. Labour and Liberal Democratc = Only if more powers go to Brussels ie Treaty change will they support a referendum.
2. **Conservatives** = If they are able to form a government Cameron has unconditionally promised a referendum for **2017** come what may and he would negotiate ""reform"" to then vote to stay in the EU.
3. UKIP = Almost impossible to win the GE but they would support holding a referendum which as per 2015 Genereal Election would likely require as per Scotland's referendum minimum a few years ie 2017 to hold.

&gt;*and then a vote on said referendum, yes? And if that all transpires, approximately how many years until the UK is completely out?*

Upon an ""OUT"" vote, the UK would follow the procedure laid out in **Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty** that allows a secession of a member state to have **up to 2 years to renegotiate** a new relationship with the EU. So it would take within that time frame. Constitutionally the UK could repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and all it's constituent acts in a single day in Parliament, in theory; alternatively. But the Lisbon Treaty Article 50 TEU as per International Law guarantees the terms of leaving and hence is the only realistic option for the UK to take to avoid major problems.

&gt;*And, at that point, would all EU citizens wishing to work in the UK have to apply for a work visa like the rest of the world has to?*

No under the **Vienna Convention** their status is more or less guaranteed. There would be some changes and the UK in some scenarios would need to make arrangements with EU member states. I doubt any mischief would result from it however.

However, if the UK were to enter the **EEA** then as per the 4 freedoms it would not be an immediate change at all. There probably would be motions to modify worker's rights vs moving without work and those related issues of economic migration, and at that granular detail, but that's outside the scope of discussion.",0,1402571488,null,0,false,0,ci5ky7m,t3_27xrup,t1_ci5ky7m,t3_27xrup,null,1434204898,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Facendo i conti, il latino, allo scientifico, è la materia con la maggioranza assoluta delle ore. Non si può prendere nessuna posizione in difesa di questa perdita di tempo. Uno spreco di tempo ed energie a tradurre favole e testi storici/filosofici già ampiamente tradotti e leggibili in italiano. E' una forzatura odiosa. Con tutto quello che di bello c'è al mondo e che si potrebbe insegnare a scuola viene insegnata una cosa del genere. Sono d'accordo con chi parla di informatica. Ma qualsiasi altra cosa va bene, anche cinque ore di libere discussioni tra studenti su argomenti a tema. Ripeto, non c'è nessuna giustificazione per la presenza di una materia del genere, che richiede un grande sforzo da parte degli studenti e il piacere di una minimissima parte di questi.

Ma è un caso ipotetico, cosa c'è da contestare? Ne fai un altro e basta, ma perché dire che non è valido?

Ho solo provato ad immaginarmi in una situazione in cui la mia ipotetica moglie mi dice ""eh cambio sesso"".

E vorrei l'annullamento del matrimonio, invece che il divorzio, perché mi trovo in una situazione che non volevo (sposato con un uomo) e non voglio trovarmi a pagare gli alimenti per qualcosa che non ho fatto e in cui non ho (giustamente) voce in capitolo.

Il punto non è che sia un trans in sé (perché se all'altra persona sta bene, sti cazzi), ma che minghia, sto parlando di correttezza.

Se lei si è sempre sentita un uomo (perché non penso ci si svegli la mattina scoprendolo), sarebbe stato giusto dirlo al proprio partner, ma anche al di là del matrimonio, è semplice rispetto per il partner non nascondere una cosa così importante!

Boh per me chiunque si può sposare con chiunque, fottesega, finché siano adulti consenzienti.

Il problema che sollevavo è sul consenzienti!

Però è più facile additare l'altro come uno che dice stronzate à la Giovanardi invece di stare ad ascoltare quello che dice.

The terminal was built to a design that minimized walking distances, which was fine in the days when air travel was less common and you didn't have to check in two hours before your flight. Nowadays, if you're unlucky enough to walk into the main terminal building when people are queuing to check in to a couple of large flights, you'll find the main concourse blocked. Additionally, it's located close to residential areas, and although this is conveniently near the city centre, initial plans to build an U-Bahn line never came to fruition, so the only way to it is by car (if you can find somewhere to park), taxi or bus.

SXF is far more sensibly located with good public transport connections, but was built for the GDR and is consequently far too small for current demand.

Personally, I think they could have just built a new terminal at SXF. Unfortunately, the running of the whole project was entrusted to politicians with huge egos and little idea.",0,1402573023,null,0,false,0,ci5l9jd,t3_27wjcy,t1_ci5l9jd,t1_ci5jcnr,null,1434205047,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

Just a few recommandation for places to visit or to eat at in Strasbourg:
Hi!

The must see for me are: La Petite France (gorgeous little place that has a very small-town feeling in the middle of a big city), the Orangerie parc, the Cathedral + Rue des Hallebardes and the boat ride to check out the european institutions.

Other than that and if you have some time: the jardin botanique and parc de la Citadelle are also pretty nice, the inside of the Palais de l'Université is also quite interesting to see and why not check out some museums if you're into that? 

For food: l'Argentoratum (nearby the Petite France) offers some great traditional local cuisine for a reasonable price. The Maison Kammerzell is a very famous restaurant just next to the Cathedral that has a nice offer of traditional cuisine as well. They make a delicious Sauerkraut with smoked fish filets, but the personnel is perhaps not the most welcoming (from my experience). Don't forget to book in advance as it may be busy during this weekend!

For cheaper alternatives for food, you can try out a burger at l'Académie de la bière or a flammenkuch at Les Brasseurs, or try out some sandwich shops at the Esplanade (Made in France, Kebabs, ...), they are cheap and good (most of the time).

Try to avoid hanging out too long around the central station late at night or around the Esplanade as it may get sometimes a bit sketchy (never had an issue personnally but keep that in mind). Avoid going in the ""ghettos"" in Neuhof and Cronenbourg / Hautepierre, nothing really nice for you to see there (pretty far from the city center anyway).

Hope it helped! Enjoy your time there! :)

Yes but we aren't Norway (and our tax rates already go upto 45%!), and the figures show we already more than our way for our services.  Norway also enjoys wages 30% higher us (and their minimum wage is double ours) and so actually have higher purchasing power compared to us even with those tax rates.

&gt;There is absolutely no point in independence if you cede control to the UK government.

1. BoE is not the UK government
2. You're ceding a limited amount of control
3. This argument is used by UKIP to get the UK out of the EU, 'what's the point of being independent if Brussels gets to tell you how to live eh?'

In the real world there is not a single nation on Earth that works completely independently, we are all interdependent upon each other whether it be in terms of global defense or movement of trade or what have you.

&gt;Surrendering fiscal control but not keeping policy in line with each other is exactly what killed the Eurozone.

There are whole books on the Eurozone problems and it's not merely a case of having a shared currency but more of having wildly varying economies with few controls in place.  Obviously you have to be in a currency union for it to go wrong but that's like saying you have to be alive for you to be ill.

There are plenty of examples of shared currencies working fine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_union)

&gt;Mark Carney acknowledged this

He acknowledged there would be issues to work out and negotiate (e.g. will Scotland get formal representation at the BoE?) but he did not say that it couldn't, or shouldn't, be done as that was a question for the two governments.

&gt;Probable membership, not guaranteed. Germany is massively different.

There is no precedent for removing whole nations from the EU and stripping it's people of their EU citizenship (I mention East Germany because it's the closest thing there is to a precedent of accelerated accession that was done to avoid chaos).  The *only* question will be what existing agreements Scotland enjoys as being part of the UK (e.g. rebate) will it get to keep during the negotiation.  [Even Whitehall thinks it is absolutely certain that Scotland cannot be kicked out of the EU](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm).

Why ? Because France is under a parliamentary regime : the parliament (in fact more the Assemblée Nationale than the Sénat) has constitutional tools to remove the government, i.e. one of the two heads of the executive in France, the other one being the President, who is legally and politicaly irresponsable before the Parliament. On the other hand the President, so the executive, has a tool to remove the Parliament : the dissolution. So, in the end, there really is a system of check and balance, even if the very nature of the fifth Republic is to have a President, a government and a parliament being from the same political leaning for a maximal efficiency (i.e., the authors of the consitution of 1958 *never* thought that the cohabitation could happen)

And unlike what you seem to think, the only real functional and democratic *fully* (so not *semi* like in the case of France) presidential regime in the world is in... the USA, country that is de facto not under a parliamentary regime.
The executive power is entirely between the hands of the POTUS, and there is no constitutional tools allowing the executive and the legislature (so the POTUS and the American parliament) to remove each other, or even to really have a strong influence on each other. We generally say that the regime of the USA is one of strict separation of powers, unlike most parliamentary regime (most of Europe, including France for instance) that are of flexible separation of powers.

So in fact, depending on the situation, the POTUS can have a great power, way much more extented that the power of the french President, or being in a situation where he will indeed be limited by the congress, like in the votation of the budget.",0,1402573953,null,0,1402574558,0,ci5lgsu,t3_27y0gj,t1_ci5lgsu,t1_ci5j89y,null,1434205142,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,maripool,null,null,"&gt; Train and car both have their advantages... if you're willing to drive and your group is a size that fits into a car well, you really are better off driving - both in terms of convenience and price.

I disagree. My advice: Take the train, get a seat reservation in a compartment and you have the privacy of a car (as there are only 6 seats in a compartment 2nd class) combined with the perks of a train ride (toilets, food car, walking around, interacting with each other in your group much more fun, etc.)

And with 6 people, you get a [group rebate](http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/prices/germany/group_discount.shtml) (I just checked for 30/9....around 234,- in the ICE nonstop Berlin-Munich, makes 39,- EUR per person. The earlier you book, the cheaper)

Tipp for OP: 
If you can, decide within the next few weeks. Group bookings with the rail company can be made 12 months in advance, while individual bookings only 92 days in advance. So until the end of june, only groups can book for end of september - you'll find better discounts and better reservation space before the general crowds start to book.

And another tipp: Perhaps check at a local Australian travel agency as well. Often foreign tourists might get cheap deals when they book from abroad at home - deals that ""normal"" local customers will never see (a bit like those [German rail passes](http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/prices/germany/germanrailpass.shtml) which are only available for non-EU-citizens. Or that rental cars are usually cheaper when booked from home instead of booked at your destination).

true,ssshane,BELG,Belgium,"There's many EU dossiers that all seek to help complete the digital single market. Off the top of my head: 

- copyright: This issue is the most 'upper-level barrier' to completing the digital single market. French Commissioner Barnier has been stalling the review of the 2001 Copyright Directive, by institution one public consultation (a major failure) after the other. Mostly because of strong influence of the French cultural sector (copyright lobby).

- funding for high-speed broadband: digital infrastructure is the backbone of the digital single market, the problem is that infrastructure is still fragmented along national markets. The EU's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) initially would have funded EUR 9 billion towards getting a pan-European network, but Member States during negotiations with the European Parliament on the long-term EU budget (MFF) got this down to just EUR 1 billion.

- Connected Continent Regulation: this was one the last and most important files that the European Parliament adopted its position on. It entailed topics like net neutrality, roaming and spectrum (for mobile internet, WiFi, etc). The EP's position was VERY consumer-oriented, especially on net neutrality, which is great news considering what's happening in the US. Again, the Member States last week already raised ""serious concerns"" and will most likely water it down. EP and Member States might come to an agreement before the end of the year.

- Data Protection: this file has been going on for ages and is supposed to harmonize the EU's privacy framework. The EP's position again was very pro-consumer and had strong privacy provisions. I don't know Member States' position on it (it's a huge and complicated file as well), but I do know they have been stalling it forever (mostly because of the UK). The file could be concluded by the end of the year.

**TL;DR - A lot of attention has gone and will go to completing the EU's Digital Single Market. For the most part, the European Parliament has been very pro-consumer and pro-internet, but Member States have been quite reluctant in making progress, and in many cases have watered down provisions.**",0,1402574419,null,0,false,0,ci5lkkv,t3_27yagr,t1_ci5lkkv,t3_27yagr,null,1434205192,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

true,Paladin8,null,null,"&gt;Ich bin auch der Meinung, dass in Deutschland niemand auf der Straße leben muss. Es gibt immer Mittel und Wege, um dem zu entgehen. Wer aber nicht willens oder zu stolz ist, den Staat um Unterstützung zu bitten, dem kann man auch nicht helfen. 

Das ist im Allgemeinen richtig und im Speziellen trotzdem falsch. Wir haben Millionen Arbeitslose und Geringverdiener die trotzdem nicht obdachlos sind oder hungern müssen und das ist der große Erfolg unseres Sozialsystems. Diejenigen die trotzdem auf der Straße leben kann man grob in 4 Kategorien einteilen, aufsteigend nach Größe sortiert (meinem Eindruck nach):

* Diejenigen die durch die Lücken fallen. Ja, solche Leute gibt es, habe ich im direkten Umfeld erlebt. Es sind wenige, aber sie sind da.  
* Diejenigen die zu stolz sind sich Hilfe zu holen. Selbst Schuld, keine Frage.  
* Diejenigen die auf der Straße leben wollen und somit durch reine Angebote ohne Zwangscharakter nicht von der Straße zu kriegen sind.  
* Psychisch Kranke. Der Anteil psychischer Krankheiten variierender Stärke unter Obdachlosen ist unglaublich. Bei vielen ist es ""nur"" ein milder Realitätverlust oder die Folgen von Sucht und (physischer) Krankheit, aber es gibt auch genug die an Schizophrenie oder Paranoia leiden und denen man im Prinzip nur durch Einweisung helfen kann.

Die letzte Gruppe stellt meiner Erfahrung nach die große Mehrheit der Obdachlosen auf der Straße und eine noch größere Mehrheit unter den als störend empfundenen. Wer durch Sucht, Trauma oder Krankheit die Verbindung zur Realität ganz oder teilweise verliert, verhält sich un- oder asozial ohne es wahrzunehmen oder als schlimm zu empfinden. Um diesen Menschen zu helfen ist ein völlig anderer Ansatz notwendig als das was unsere Sozialsysteme tun.

When you've reserved and paid for seats on a train, there's no staying at breakfast for another hour because the sun's shining or because you found someone interesting to talk to, or spontaneously switching up your next destination because you met people who convinced you where they're going is much better than what you had planned...

* last 3 years of my smoking it was pack a day, every day

* I quit and it was very easy for me, no horror story you see around

but year before I went cold turkey, I tried to go in to lowering my smoking to 10 cigs a day

Yeah, that was hell and I didnt last a week..

It was counting hours and minutes and trying to sepearate those 10 in to even dosages

when the time drew near to next, I could not concentrate well

the moment I lit up, I didnt feel all that good as well, because I felt the restriction of the upcoming hours looming over me

Then I switched from 10 separated in to the day, to smoke as you please 10 and then its over until the next day

that worked a bit, but then I started to sneak in some cigs from the next day and shit...

and then it broke

Quiting cold turkey was just suprisingly easy without any real long strugle, first week when cravings came... taking in few deep breathes and telling the brain.. *""yeah you can stop with that you aint getting any, so its pointless to think about it""*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Gibraltar#Finance

(Note: the only government to decline a tax information exchange agreement with Gibraltar was the Spanish government).

Agreed that tobacco smuggling is a problem and both governments need to take care of it. But the Spanish government is just using it as an excuse to cause chaos at the border.

I'll give you an example how they do it: this morning I had to go to Marbella and upon returning to Gibraltar I got 'stuck' in the queue coming inside. There were probably 50 cars in the queue, which is not really much. However, the reason why there was a queue was because the special forces of the Guardia Civil were stopping all traffic, right before the border, in the green channel (there's only one channel really). They would stop one car for a minute or two, check nothing, then stop the following car... etc.

Even the regular Police (Policia Nacional) are affected by these special forces guys.

Imagine that you're returning from a flight and you pick up your luggage and go through the green channel (or blue) with nothing to declare and the police is stopping everyone, one by one, checking everything (or not doing anything at all). That's what they're doing here at the border.",0,1402576060,null,0,false,0,ci5lzdt,t3_27v9tq,t1_ci5lzdt,t1_ci4ym6x,null,1434205386,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

EFTA != EEA, and neither includes Switzerland. EFTA includes Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and the EEA is EFTA + EU. To join the EEA, the UK would therefore have to apply, and get the EU's approval in what would presumably be difficult negociations, since the ""[EEA Agreement provides for the inclusion of EU legislation covering the four freedoms — the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital — throughout the 31 EEA States.](http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement)"". Since one of the main subjects of criticism of the EU in Britain is the freedom of movement of persons, these negociations could be more difficult than some in Westminster affect to believe.

In fact, even joining EFTA alone could be difficult, since there's still that conflict with Iceland re. Icesave.

The relationship between the EU and Switzerland is based on bilateral treaties, but negotiating those would also be an uphill battle.

What constitutes a mere passing phase in American history, in a small segment of the economy, constitutes for that individual the bulk of his life. This is the fundamental tension between a nation and an individual. Nations operate on a different clock than individuals. Under most circumstances, where the individuals affected are few and disorganized, the nation grinds down the individual. In those cases where the individual understands that his children might make a significant leap forward, the individual might acquiesce. But when the affected individuals form a substantial bloc, and when even the doubling of an economy might not make a significant difference in the happiness of children, they might well resist.

The important point here is to focus on the clock, on the different scales of time and how they change things.""

Don't forget that, in 2002, Le Pen Sr. came in a close second in the first round of the French presidential election. In the 2nd round, however, with just two candidates, he was trounced 4:1, as everybody else but his faithful held their noses to vote for Chirac.

&gt;The home page after you logged in does not look very good. The buttons with the &gt;curved edges and plain colors does not work well. I know you're trying to fit in with &gt;the rest of the site designs, but perhaps consider changing it a little bit, I think the &gt;design needs a little help.

This is really helpful. I want to make sure the site is as attractive as it can be to users. Any suggestions on how it could look nicer?

&gt; The journalling system is well done, and works well, but I would say implement &gt;some sort of points system in order to drive users to correcting translations, and &gt;putting their own journals higher as a result.

That's a great idea.

&gt;The Statistics section is great, I love to see that sort of stuff. The score that is &gt;shown on the Home page has no explanation of why or how it is accumulated, or &gt;what it is used for.

I'm glad you like the statistics section. It's something I've wanted on other sites because I thought it could help me figure out how I'm progressing. As far as points go, you're absolutely right that they need more explanation.

&gt;One thing I noticed is that what language I could learn seems dependent on what I &gt;put in my preferences, even though the site only supports German and English &gt;right now.

I will be adding more languages over time. I started with German because I wanted to learn it, and as I get a sense on how the site is doing I can add more. Also, the open ended system lets people practice other languages in the journal entry feature of the site. So, even if a user from, say, India, doesn't want to learn German, that user can still practice English in a journal form.

&gt;One thing I would like to know is about how new words are chosen, you mentioned &gt;that it uses the frequency lists, but in what way, does it just start at the number &gt;one used word and work its way down? And what list are you using, there doesn't &gt;seem to be any information on whether the list is most spoken, written, or used &gt;online.

Thanks for this question. The word list is based on a corpus of book quotes, movie quotes and song lyrics I've collected. The mindset behind these is a lot of these words are seen in popular culture, and I wanted to see if that helps people learn words better. And yes, it starts at one and works its way down. There are around 6,000 words right now in the database, and I'm hoping to add more as I get feedback on the beta version of the site.

&gt;Overall, very well done, apart from a few things design-wise the site is great. It is &gt;very easy to use, and very intuitive. I wish you the best of luck, and I will continue &gt;using the site for now.

Thanks again and I look forward to any other thoughts you have as you use it!",0,1402577277,null,0,false,0,ci5mbnj,t3_27x4yy,t1_ci5mbnj,t1_ci5fm5d,null,1434205546,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

true,almareado,PORT,Algarve - Portugal,"As a Portuguese i've watched this situation from the sidelines with a mix of  disbelief and amusement. 

I live 20km from the Spanish border and 230km from Gibraltar itself. 

When i hear the Spanish complain about Gibraltar overfishing in their waters i tend to chuckle, considering how much damage was done to Portuguese fisheries in the past decades by the Spanish fishing fleet. I've witness a whole species of crab all but disappear in the Ria Formosa natural park when the Spanish ""discovered it"", which only now seems to be recovering. 

The British then talk as if Gilbratar is a ""normal"" area of administration, as if it was not a big source of contraband and money laundering (basically all it does these days) which does nothing for the region it's inserted in. 

Then comes all the doublespeak about sovereignty from both sides, which at this point simply disgusts me. 

The Spanish talk as if they don't hold Ceuta, Melilla and (illegally) Olivença. The nerve. 

The British talk as if they didn't take the opposite stance when Portugal made the exact same claims regarding (for instance) Goa in India (which was held for far longer than Gilbraltar ever was British). Not that the Portuguese would want to claim it back, just pointing out that these people only use these arguments to defend their claims, and reverse them to accuse others of colonialism. 

According to British arguments, if you transfer a population of your country into an enclave on another country (a whole other landmass in this case) and proceed on asking said people if they want to keep the flag of their old country, it gives you the legitimacy to hold that territory and call it your own. There's a name for that: colonialism. 

If you believe this argument you should then accept Russia's claim on Crimea. They too had a 'referendum' (i know, Gilbraltar's referendum didn't need to be manipulated but you get what i'm implying).

I'm all up for self determination but if you use that argument to annex territory (as opposed to a community claiming it's own independence) you're undermining that very principle, as countries can easily claim that self determination movements on their territory are just manipulation from a foreign power. 

The shouting from both sides is simply ridiculous and while in principle i believe both Gibraltar and the Falklands should belong to the regions they're inserted in, i make no escuses for the Spanish and Argentinian governments when they also act like spoiled little brats. 

**TLDR**: Both sides are hypocrites. ",0,1402577374,null,0,false,0,ci5mcnp,t3_27v9tq,t1_ci5mcnp,t3_27v9tq,null,1434205559,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,_vikram,null,null,"&gt; Yo, this site is very solid and I like it, as other people have mentioned you are going up against a couple of bigger players doing this, and at first glance there isn't much I can see that makes uberling unique. It is a fun site to use though, and I will be integrating it into my learning.

Thanks for all your feedback! I completely agree that there already bigger guys at play. Success in language learning for me was using as many resources as there are out there as possible and figuring out what works best for me. I'm hoping that people use uberling in addition to all the other sites out there. For example, using both uberling and duolingo I believe can go a long way for a user. I think uberling can fill a few gaps in other sites as it relates to vocab and using a language (like you pointed out with the journal feature) that will be a great complement to other sites out there.

&gt;Now, some points that in my opinion need work. The sentence translation. You have the option to type it, or use ""fridge magnet"" words underneath. I think there should be less options there to begin with. First try to just type it, if you can't then click a button for the ""fridge magnets"" and then try with them, and if you really cant get it, then click a button to reveal the answer. The last point there is very, very important. Having a translation area on your site without a reveal option will cause major frustration for people and ultimately will lead to rage quits.

These are great points! Both the reveal and a ""fridge magnet"" feature would be really helpful, I agree. There are some technical concerns around the sentence translation feature (like supporting multiple translations of a sentence), and I'm hoping to get to those soon.

&gt;Before I go - keyboard controls! Multiple choice = 1-9 on the keyboard for quick navigation etc!

Yes! 100% agree. Hopefully this will be ready in the next revision of the site.

true,HappyReaper,null,null,"The concept is called ""redistribution of wealth"". A capitalist society has plenty of advantages, but one of its inherent attributes is that the more money you have, the easier it is to earn even more money; also, the less money you have, the bigger impact does a fixed amount means to you. Because of that, without a proportional redistribution of wealth, the differences between citizens would just keep growing and growing, and it would be very easy to end up in a closed class system, where for the majority of people the quality and amount of choices they would have during their life would be decided the moment they are born. One of the better ways we know for implementing said redistribution of wealth is through proportional taxation, which is used to fund public services available for the whole population, and a welfare net so nobody is left behind, by demanding money to every citizen proportional to what they have.

Personally, I find proportional taxation to be a very good system as it guarantees some degree of equal opportunities for everybody no matter their background, it allows people to come back on their feet even after going through hard times, and does all that by asking an equal economic effort from everyone (proportional to their wealth). Also, I think it's a mistake to say that ""those who earn more money inherently deserve to have more money"", because the amount of money people earn is very weakly related to the social contribution of their work, and because every day that passes (mainly due to mechanisation) the amount of available work is smaller compared to the amount of people looking for work, so there is going to be an ever increasing number of human beings that will never be able to work enough to sustain themselves; not because they don't want to, but because they can't.",0,1402578483,null,0,false,0,ci5moq2,t3_27y96m,t1_ci5moq2,t1_ci5lj85,null,1434205716,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The mindset behind these is a lot of these words are seen in popular culture, and I wanted to see if that helps people learn words better.

Do we even have *any* common goods, tv stations, movies, tv series, services and brands we all use that aren't **american**? Okay, probably Carlsberg, IKEA and maybe Lidl.. but that's about it... hahahahhaa.

European companies in each sector prefer to keep a *monopoly* over their current turf under the prices they convinced their subjects to pay.

In fact, if you think that a physical single market *exists*, prove it. Just lifting some barriers and fees in trade doesn't make people/companies to suddenly act as if they now represent the entire European Union in their sector, especially companies with agreements with their suppliers tying them to servicing only one country. Can the official Cypriot agent for BMW open up an office in Berlin and sell BMWs to germans.. in London.. in Paris... in Warsaw? No. Can't just go around entering other people's *turf* like that.

Actually.. lets bring up an old discussion we had in /r/europe ages ago about Amazon.. the price differences for the same goods sold by amazon (and likely shipped from the same warehouse -- or at least i personally ordered from .es and received it from germany).. different prices by which country tld you use. Justified by people by saying that they only have to compete with the *local* prices. You know what a single market would look like? A single amazon.eu with the same base price + your country's vat + shipping to your country from the warehouse. This digital reality is caused by the physical market reality, in that a single market *doesn't* exist, and everyone in the current chain would prefer things stay the way they are.

According to my own experience in several countries in europe including spain. France has by far the worst bureaucracy among them, we are protected for a lot of things, more than most other countries, but that need paperwork. And since the French administration, doesn't want to upgrade their infrastructure with new technology. You have still a shit tons of useless duplicate or completly useless paper to fill.

Das Sozialamt verweigert nicht jegliche Hilfe, es verlangt nur Unmöglichkeiten:  
Abmeldung beim vorherigen Sozialamt, welches damit nicht bei kommt (Ortswechsel wegen körperlicher Drohungen). Eine einseitige Neueintragung ist nur möglich wenn eine Meldeadresse vorliegt, was aufgrund überfüllter Obdachlosenwohnheime im konkreten Fall nicht geht. Abwicklung übers Jobcenter geht nicht, da arbeitsunfähig (Verletzung am Fuß, kann kaum stehen). Behandlung selbigens fällt aus, da nicht krankenversichert (weil arm, arbeitslos und nicht beim JC angemeldet).

Nicht ganz so schlimm, aber mir selbst passiert:  
Wechsel vom Studium ins Erwerbsleben und muss umziehen. Das würde ich mir gerne vom Jobcenter vorstrecken oder finanzieren lassen. Vorher Wohngeld bezogen. Das Jobcenter weigert sich mir einen Leistungsbescheid auszustellen, bevor ich einen Einstellungsbescheid vom Amt für Wohnungswesen vorlege. Das Amt für Wohnungswesen weigert sich mir einen Einstellungsbescheid auszustellen, bevor nicht geprüft wurde ob eine Überzahlung vorliegt, wofür die einen Leistungsbescheid vom Jobcenter wollen. Das Sozialamt kann (oder will) nicht tätig werden solange noch das Eröffnungsverfahren beim Jobcenter läuft.

Zu 2, 3 und eingeschränkt 4: Allgemeine Zustimmung, habe ich etwas anderes behauptet? Mir ging es nur um den Punkt ""Sozialsystem löst Obdachlosigkeit"", was bei einem großen Teil der Obdachlosen schlicht nicht greift.

Write them back saying your number (+ 1 or 2k) is what you consider appropriate for the kind of position they want to fill.

I do not agree with the idea that poor people are poor because they have no choice. Every single person's social and financial standing depends on the decisions they've made in their life. Everyone can become rich, as long as they're ready to contribute the required effort.  
It's true that a rich person probably has more opportunities to become richer. It's always easier to continue on a solid foundation, rather than start from the beginning. But life was, is and always will be unfair. And we have to act accordingly.  
I personally know several people who were born to a lower-class family. They became successful and now work on high-salary positions, because they made the right decisions and contributed huge efforts to make their lives better. And everyone has the choice to do the same. Many people don't, and it's their own fault.  
This is why I strongly oppose proportional taxation. Someone who has put in considerable effort to guarantee a good salary should not be punished by the state. Doing to stifles economy and reduces the incentive to aspire to higher-paid positions. The money is then given to someone who has not worked for it and deserves it much less that the person it was taken from.  

There are numerous free courses available for anyone to take. There are many open positions even for people with no skills. Thing is, nobody can expect to live luxuriously if they have no skills.

4th and 5th: same jobs but not experience but scale of employer (in employees)
8th: bad paying industries (so if your company is one of those...)
9th: good paying industries
10th: postal code- you see, Berlin is in 1**** and as it is the former GDR and industries are not as developed (don't know how to express that in better English words), salaries tend to be lower there. But also the costs for living.

There is definitely not as much money in the jobs compared to the US. I work for an international company and I know that US colleagues get about 25 to 33% more money than me (at least I think it was something like that, it was kinda ridiculous). 

Raises differ by the companies (as well as the payment). I get an annual raise and some bigger companies have that in their contracts as well (talking about 2 to 10 percent). 

That all being said: My salary is higher than they offered by a larger amount (&gt;8000EUR) and I have only 3 years of experience. Than again, I don't work in Web development but in software development and not in Berlin but in BadenWürttemberg (so postalcode 7****).

true,Redotaff,null,null,"&gt; copyright: This issue is the most 'upper-level barrier' to completing the digital single market. French Commissioner Barnier has been stalling the review of the 2001 Copyright Directive, by institution one public consultation (a major failure) after the other. Mostly because of strong influence of the French cultural sector (copyright lobby).

The commission was actually supposed to propose a new regulation on this very topic this month, apparently they got delayed though... It isn't certain for how long. I'm pretty sure there is an impact assessment under way, but I haven't bothered to check, just waiting on the new regulation to look at it.

&gt; funding for high-speed broadband: digital infrastructure is the backbone of the digital single market, the problem is that infrastructure is still fragmented along national markets. The EU's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) initially would have funded EUR 9 billion towards getting a pan-European network, but Member States during negotiations with the European Parliament on the long-term EU budget (MFF) got this down to just EUR 1 billion.

=(  

oh well, at least last month they passed the directive relative to [Measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2013/0080(COD))

Lotsa good stuff in it, like the obligation for all buildings to be equiped with technology neutral infrastructures compatible with high-speed deployment. And measures to force the different networks to cooperate and share their infrastructures and development projects, as well as platforms to facilitate all that.

Contrary to what you said the parliament actually had made it shittier (making it affect only public buildings, lowering the definition of high-speed and a few other things I cant recall). It got better in the talks with the council.

&gt; Connected Continent Regulation: this was one the last and most important files that the European Parliament adopted its position on. It entailed topics like net neutrality, roaming and spectrum (for mobile internet, WiFi, etc). The EP's position was VERY consumer-oriented, especially on net neutrality, which is great news considering what's happening in the US. Again, the Member States last week already raised ""serious concerns"" and will most likely water it down. EP and Member States might come to an agreement before the end of the year.

This will not pass before the end of the year, there isn't even a progress report yet and there are deep deep disagreements on stuff like  spectre policy, net neutrality and european authorizations. It ""could"" take until the end of 2015 to pass.

You are true when you say that the europarl is very pro-consummer, but actually the part that has the most chance of making it out of council intact is the consummer rights section. 

As always the EP has very nice ideas, but some of the things in the text are just not applicable (i'm taking principally about network management as it is written in the text, not even net neutrality itself).

It also ignores the fact that ISPs have to invest, and need money. Roaming is very likely to pass though imo, but it doesnt really change much as the different Roaming regulations meant that ISPs were already working on it (on the top of my head roaming was to end by 2017, might be wrong though). They just have to get hurry it up a little. They'll lose some money in the process, but they 'll be fine.

This text might actually get knocked down (probably parts of it will anyways), because it deals with very different things that don't necessarily have to do with one another.


&gt; Data Protection: this file has been going on for ages and is supposed to harmonize the EU's privacy framework. The EP's position again was very pro-consumer and had strong privacy provisions. I don't know Member States' position on it (it's a huge and complicated file as well), but I do know they have been stalling it forever (mostly because of the UK). The file could be concluded by the end of the year.

I wouldn' say it's been going on for ages, average time for a regulation is around 2 years (that means some take more, some less), it's been less than two years.

It has not been stalling forever, it is actually going very fast. It was actually on the agenda on last week's juri council. They agreed on the territorial scope (yay!), transfers to third-countries, and had a discussion on the one-stop-shop mecanism.

This was voted on (in the parliament) only in march. The council has made great progress, the greek presidency really pushed for it. You are not being fair in praising the EP and blaming the member states.

Also, all of those texts were passed in the last 2/3 months when the EP had them for some time. Coincidence or EP elections?

**TLDR: The council is not evil, it is actually better informed than MEPs. Though I agree that MS do block lotsa shit because they wanna keep their competences.**

PS : I'm not eurosceptic because I criticize the EP. I'm pro-european and a federalist.

true,CafeClope,ZZZZZZvin,Vin,"Hello,

Encore une fois je ne dénigre pas la production musicale japonaise. Au contraire, la pop n'est que rarement représentative d'un pays. Je pense en revanche que la musique japonaise qui passe sur NoLife, essentiellement de la jpop/visual kei (mais pas seulement j'en suis conscient) ne plaît pas suffisamment en France, que ce soit en termes de % dans une tranche de population ciblée (tous les gamers ne vont pas être ""otaku"" par exemple) ou à travers la population en générale (la jpop n'attire pas des spectateurs qui ne s'intéressent pas déjà aux mangas). 

On peut sûrement en trouver pour tous les goûts dans la musique japonaise, mais est-ce le cas sur NoLife ? Rien que le fait d'être une chaîne indépendante de télévision vous empêche d'accéder aux artistes moins connus (ou trop connus) ou à ceux qui n'ont pas de clip pour leurs chansons. 

La ligne éditoriale de NoLife est le choix de ses dirigeants, c'est évident. Néanmoins je pense qu'il s'agit de remettre en question ces décisions face à la réalité de la situation. S'il y avait un vrai marché pour la jpop en France, la chaîne serait largement rentable. Or, ce n'est pas le cas, comme en témoignent la vidéo, ainsi que les problèmes de financement publicitaire, avant cela, le rachat nécessaire par Ankama (pour le coup l'émission qui l'annonçait était en plein sentimentalisme, Nolife no Lacryma pardon mais bon).

Alors, pourquoi est-ce que je dis tout ça au lieu de m'en foutre. Déjà, je tiens à te remercier pour tes messages, malgré la relative dureté de mes propos il est évident que je respecte ce que vous avez accompli et que Nolife est un projet remarquable. Ce qui me chiffonne personnellement, c'est ça :

Des tas de gens paient un abonnement ""de soutien"" supérieur aux 5€/m pour aider la chaîne. Sur votre forum il y a déjà des pages et des pages, des dizaines de message, de personnes qui ont fait grimper le montant de leur abonnement suite à ta vidéo. Des personnes aisées, d'autres non, des étudiants, des chômeurs, des cadres. Leur démarche n'est plus de payer pour un service mais de donner à un projet. Or, si NoLife ne se réforme pas de manière à être une entreprise (à tous les sens du terme) correctement rentable, tout cela ne servira à rien. Si le déficit est ""structurel"", NL finira par fermer un jour ou l'autre et tous ces dons auront été faits en vain. Et j'irai jusqu'à dire que la confiance des gens qui vous soutiennent aura été trahie. 

C'est important d'avoir une vision. Mais si celle-ci n'est pas viable il est, à mon sens, malhonnête de vouloir la poursuivre aux dépens (financiers notamment) des gens qui croient en vous et qui ont l'espoir de voir NoLife se redresser. Si votre ligne éditoriale ne convient pas au marché, les vidéos, les abonnements de soutien, tout ça ne fait que retarder un peu plus la fin. Il faut parfois faire des concessions, notamment sur certains programmes (je ne suis pas le seul à parler de la jpop) plutôt que d'être intransigeant et de persister dans un modèle, qui, d'après ce qui transparaît, est voué à l'échec. 

Naturellement je n'ai pas les chiffres, ni les détails. Ce message peut sembler présomptueux de ma part, tant pis. Le fonds de ma pensée est le suivant : J'aimerais beaucoup que NoLife continue à diffuser, mais je ne pense pas que ce soit possible sans de gros changements. Sans changement, la chaîne semble vouée à disparaître. Si elle doit disparaître, il vaudrait mieux pour tout le monde que ce soit tôt plutôt que tard. En tout cas, continuer ainsi tout en encourageant les fans à financer la chaîne n'est pas acceptable.

To get you started on taxes and social security, checkout http://www.brutto-netto-rechner.info/ (put in 42k Jährlich, berlin, no Kirchensteuer). You'd get 2156 EUR per month, the rest is mostly taxes, health care, unemployment insurance and retirement plan.

- make sure your son takes his AP-classes, preferrably a second language (German should be fine)

- he'll have to prove that he's sufficient funds (= 12 * 800€ for the first year) to sustain his stay in Germany. Better start saving now :)

- please mind that there aren't many Bachelor classes taught in English, and even if there are any, they'll possibly have German exams. Most universities require foreign students who want to study something in German to possess the language level B1 or B2. It's okay if he doesn't pass the test, he could stay in Germany and take language classes at the Goethe Institut until his German is good enough.

My data point is just one, but do a google search or even a reddit search and you'll see other women saying the same thing and other men believing the same thing you do.

There's an insecurity (concerns for my safety, e.g. in ignoring the guy).

There's a violation of privacy (I didn't choose to be in this space to interact with you)

There's a power play in it (women are raised to be too nice).

There's something dehumanizing and objectifying (I don't want to know if you think I have a nice ass).

There's often direct insult and offense (people calling you a whore, or treating you like you are one)
