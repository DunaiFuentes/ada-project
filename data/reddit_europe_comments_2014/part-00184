The outer tier of non-Eurozone countries will no longer be subject to the principle of ""Ever closer union"" unless they desire it, and will instead participate solely in legislation governing the regulation, broadening and harmonisation of the single market and economic unification. Aim to bring in the EEA states to this tier. The outer tier states can also join the federal union if they meet the requirements to join the Euro, with the blessing of the existing federal states.

Another is to more strongly stipulate the subsidiarity principle, and not allow the EU to legislate where it offers no advantages over allowing the member states to legislate on the same thing.

Pau est une ville très sympathique de 80000 habitants mais on peut monter le compte à 130000 avec les villes l'entourant et qui font partie du même ensemble. C'est donc relativement petit mais suffisant pour être actif culturellement. La ville est escarpée par endroits mais reste praticable à vélo (la partie basse est nettement moins intéressante mais il y a de toutes façons un funiculaire les reliant). Les points notables sont le coût de la vie et notamment de l'immobilier qui sera bien plus faible qu'à Bordeaux ou Nantes. Côté pratique Pau à 1h15 de l'eau comme des pistes.

Over 300 years of Roman history is under sign of *metus Gallicus*, fear of the Gauls.It dated to Battle of the Allia and sack of Rome that happened after.

Some historians make a strong case that this very defeat (and fear it created) is main reason why Rome ended up being so much different than all other mediterrean city-states and kickstarted their rise to power by leading to the 1st split of conquered land that not only defused deadly internal conflict but was responsible for immense amount of manpower Rome had compared to everyone around it.

WW2 was the real wake up call, the ""war to end wars"", at least in Europe - or so it seems from our current perspective. (Maybe in 200 years people will look back at that statement and think we were incredibly naive to believe that. I hope not.)

What seems more likely (and to me, desirable) is that the Commission will lose its exclusive right of initiative (which encroaches upon the legislative) and become more similar to the government in a parliamentary democracy.

Du hingegen schreibst: »… einem Land, dass Phosphor Bomben auf Zivilbevölkerung abfeuert …«. Jeder, der Deutsch als Muttersprache spricht, würde niemals »auf Zivilbevölkerung« schreiben oder sagen, weil es absolut unidiomatisch ist.  Entweder würde man »auf die Zivilbevölkerung« oder »auf Zivilisten« wählen.  Im Russischen hingegen gibt es meines Wissens nach keinen bestimmten Artikel wie im Deutschen, weswegen »auf Zivilbevölkerung« als »Russizismus« anzusehen ist und Dich als russischen Muttersprachler verrät.

But it's an interesting theory. With a victorious Germany they likely wouldn't have been as radical in the 20s and 30s, and, well, still have an emperor rather than said corporal. There's no way I can guess what that would mean for the 100 years from then to now in terms of how Europe would be different. 

Assuming the victory would have come in 1914, there wouldn't have been a russian revolution. There wouldn't have been a Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine &amp; Poland maybe? Not to mention the countries that Austria / Hungary fell apart to. And the Ottoman Empire might have continued on?

I think it's impossible to say what impact that would have had on Europe. Would it have meant that the 20th century had lots of small wars, would there have been stability in the major empires or would the small nation states have broken free? Would France have been able to take another loss after the humiliating one in 1870 without seeking revenge?",0,1404005893,null,0,false,0,cijpxyb,t3_29c4ag,t1_cijpxyb,t1_cijj6sd,null,1434451337,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Because its such a prize. It needs $25 billion of aid just to stay solvent for 12 months. What is the benefit here? 

Nuland is the secretary of European and Eurasian affairs. Its not that odd for her to be in Europe. 

Ill be the first to say the EU FTA was handled poorly from the outset, but I dont think the EU assumed Russia would act as they did (even if they should have). If the EU started off trying to wrestle Ukraine from Russia's sphere of influence they would have acted much more aggressively when Russia ramped up pressure. Instead they completely backed off (hence the ""fuck the EU"" comment, they were partially to blame for causing the mess then assumed someone else would clean it up). 

You're making Ukraine seem much more important than it is. The US was negotiating several free-trade agreements with Russia before this started (and investment was being negotiated first at the insistence of Russia). The US does not need a territory that is unstable, will continue to be unstable if the US stayed there due to Russia's behind the scenes action, and will require tens of billions of dollars per year to remain solvent. The notion the US tried to steal Ukraine is a bit over the top. 

&gt;They re-ignited the Cold War by extending NATO's border.

You forget the right nations have to join NATO. For some reason Russia's neighbors seem to feel they need protection from someone. You could make the same argument about Russia reigniting the cold war by annexing part of a neighboring country. 

&gt;They don't have any brains to argue with either, I've just seen downvotes in response to facts. They're lost to propaganda.

I'm not saying there has not been some pretty vehement anti-Russian sentiment the past few months. But many on here dont agree with Russia's actions. Many people on this sub were just as anti-American and were so much longer than they were anti-Russian. You also may want to look at other news sources.

~~Well, I would normally only have classes all morning or all afternoon.~~

~~- All morning classes: start 8h25, end 13h25 (3 classes).~~

~~- All afternoon classes: start 13h40, end 16h55/18h40 (2/3 classes).~~

I had 90 minutes classes with 15min recess between each of them.

**EDIT**: Before High School: start at ~9am, lunch break was shorter and I would have classes until ~17h, I think.

**EDIT 2**: I begin to realise that /r/rebur was correct. If I had ALL DAY classes (which was maybe once a week), it would go from 8h25 to 18h40. But normally it would be from 8h25 to 16h55. As you progressed through the years, you'd have less classes and start to have only all morning classes or all afternoon classes: 8h25-13h25 (all morning), 13h40-18h40 (all afternoon).

**EDIT 3: Lunch breaks (in High Schol) were from 13h25 to 15h25 - so yeah, 2 hours.** To take this into context, most people would either go eat at home (like me) or they would eat at the cafeteria or nearby cheap bars/restaurants.

The *EU toppled the Yanukovich* argument falls apart when one analysis the situation and finds that the civic momentum present at the central and western regions of Ukraine would have toppled regardless of what the EU or anyone else wanted. For his eventual demise, Yanukovich couldn't blame anyone but himself.

And then you try to equate what Russia is doing with what the EU and the US apparently does, which taking a European context is disingenuous. 

One has to differentiate between between self-interest as a justification and self-interest as a motivation. Sure, every country is motivated by self-interest but it is only acceptable when such self-interest is justified. Irredentism is a motive driven by self-interest, but history has thought too many times that it is never justified to annex any part of any other country without due process and mutual consent. Indeed throughout the whole situation Russia simply sought by force what it couldn't gain through a domestic civil movement. The Crimean scenario was nothing but a referendum fast-tracked at gunpoint. And the SE Russian separatist situation is more of the same, where Russia has fuelled conflict by both fuelling false antagonisms and fears in the east by labelling the Ukranians as *Nazis* and taking a policy of ambiguity towards separatists that take up the cause of *Russian nationalism*, yet their true motives are that of acquiring personal power through force and eventual *de facto* vassalisation under the Russian state, as had unfolded in Abkhazia and South Ossetia (where in one instance 50% of financial aid provided for infrastructure investment in that region simply ended up unaccounted for and *disappeared*).

It is not a matter of *good* and *evil*, so neither should one side be antagonised but nor should parity of action be assumed. One doesn't have to establish the premise of evil intentions to established that one side's actions are toxic beyond repair, as is the case with fuelling separatist conflict and annexing by force regions that in the short term are a burden and in the long term are a liability.

We aren't the victims, those Russia victimizes are the victims.

On a larger scale, we're dealing with a clash of civilizations here. The default setting for Americans, for example, is libertarianism. The default setting for Europeans is social democracy. The default setting for Russia, however, is chauvinistic imperialism. These approaches are mirrored in how we deal with third parties - USA seeks allies by stressing common interests, and they always seek to make a case on how their interests are _your_ interests as well. EU promotes certain standards - a way of life, you might say - and operates on a principle that those sharing these standards share interests as well. Russian foreign policy is after obedience first and foremost, the question of _common_ interests hardly ever enters the equation.

We're dealing with different and incompatible cultural contexts here. Russia has a _valid_ reason for their actions only from Russian viewpoint that we can study and understand _without_ accepting it's universal validity. Only a Russlandversteher would insinuate that they somehow have a _right_ to dictate Ukraine's actions.

&gt;And now, after we toppled the (eastern leaning) gouvernment of Ukraine, which wanted to trade more with Russia - and installed a western leaning gouvernment

You're using Russia's 'great powers' narrative here, that's a dangerous ground to be on. Would you even consider the possibility that Ukrainians themselves have agency? That _they_ toppled the government? That _they_ set up the new one?

 [**Condominium (international law)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium%20(international%20law\)): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law), a __condominium__ (plural either *condominia*, as in Latin, or condominiums) is a political territory (state or border area) in or over which two or more sovereign powers formally agree to share equally *dominium* (in the sense of sovereignty) and exercise their rights jointly, without dividing it up into 'national' zones.

&gt;Although a condominium has always been recognized as a theoretical possibility, condominia have been rare in practice. A major problem, and the reason why so few have existed in practice, is the difficulty of ensuring co-operation between the sovereign powers; once the understanding fails, the status is likely to become untenable.

&gt;The word is recorded in English since c. 1714, from Modern Latin, apparently coined in Germany c. 1700 from Latin *com-* ""together"" + *dominium* ""right of ownership"" (compare [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demesne)).

Although the details are different, Poland had the same problem in 1791 after adopting a new constitution. The King, seeing how his country was falling apart decided to reform the government and start a constitutional monarchy where the average farmer had as much say as a nobleman... that didn't sound so good for the nobility... or for Russia where serfdom was more than popular. So, they dismantled Poland.

Basically if you propose progressive changes to your government when you see things spiraling out of control, your neighbors will decide to dismantle your country before your own population starts demanding change. There really isn't anything one country can do for itself in that kind of situation. Look at Ukraine today.

That's why a stronger EU would be such a good thing, Barcelona wouldn't have to worry about pressure from Spain so much if it decided to secede. Or let's say if theoretically Slovakia and the Czech Republic decided to unite again (won't ever happen), the EU would be there to protect the transition.

I think the reason for this is that the Nordic sagas are such a big part of the culture here. We read them in the original form (only the spelling has been modernized, but everything else is the same) in primary school and then in high school as well. They're one of the cornerstones of Icelandic identity, and for that reason people don't want the language to change - they want it to be as close to Old Norse as possible.

true,adinadin,RUSS,Russia | Please correct my English,"Here are a lot of people who don't like Putin's policy and we are not a few. Sure anecdotal evidence doesn't matter but I don't see much Putin supporters in the wild. Notably most of them (who i personally know) work in education: head of my school, politology prof. at my university, many teachers. Many state workers in general, and roughly half of all employees work for state in Russia. So things are far from good as well, but you already see that. 

The problem is, if you don't personally know Russians who don't support Putin you'd unlikely hear from them. It's pointless to individually go against propaganda, when for each sane person there is kremlin-bot with prepared templates. You unlikely hear from Russian objective journalists as well since Russian companies would be punished for financing them, and foreign companies wouldn't invest in such a risky business all the more so because state does everithing to block access to objective media (blocking websites, hostile takeovers, force their rebroadcasting partners to resign contracts, etc). 

A few years ago you could go to Russian popular websites and see a real attitude towards Russian state when state policy became increasingly unpopular (nothing compared with today but at that time still completely unbelievable), politics became the №1 topic on internet, rigged elections in 2011-2012 were followed by rallies powered by internet communities (the only free space for objective media), biggest since 90's, Putin learned the role of technology and tons of pro-putin trolls appeared. I waste a little bit too much time on internet and I remember that moment very well, many popular websites became strictly pro-putin, many websites with predominantly anti-putin audience were down for weeks for various reasons, some of them were restructured in disfavour of them. That still continues and now you have a hard time to find political soulmates on internet if you don't love putin. But still there are some alive communities like http://politota.d3.ru (some people fled from there to /r/politota/ because owner of d3.ru harmed the community). Even on websites where pro-putin content is often upvoted you often can see evidence suggesting cheating on voting system or users who only post this propaganda type of posts and don't behave like real person.

The main problem isn't the number of open minded people, it's that we have no way to change something. Putin concentrated all the power in his hands, all branches of power are controlled, plus media, plus administrative resourse (influence on &gt;33 mln of votes of state workers plus &gt;42 mln of pensioners, that's popularity of all citizens and majority of all voters), putin's friends are exempt from legal prosecution and any opposers are often punished illegally. We have no legal and effective way to influence state policy, and I don't see any people who are ready to defend their rights violently. But a lot of my friends want to emigrate the hell out of Russia, so you're right, the more anti-putin Russians are leaving, and his fans are staying so things are becoming worse and worse.",0,1404037650,null,0,false,0,cijyggg,t3_29a1x9,t1_cijyggg,t1_cijmfdb,null,1434456613,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

What is the controversy then?

I understand that the issue is more nuanced and that these individuals may face punishment in their home country for attempting to evade an onerous military/civil service and general poverty, however as unfortunate as this situation is, Norway can't solve this problem by simply absorbing an endless stream of Eritrean emigrants. Ultimately it is clear that the motivation of a large proportion of asylum seekers is primarily driven by economic concerns rather than legitimate human rights abuses and in these cases, unfortunately European states cannot afford but be firm and enforce the law or they will inevitably be swamped by a number of migrants their social services can't cope with.

Krugman, que j'aime beaucoup, attaque le bitcoin sous un angle qui me concerne assez peu: il met les libertariens américains devant leurs propres contradictions et d'après lui, le principal défaut du bitcoin est de ne pas pouvoir instaurer de politique monétaire. Ses adversaires lui répondent que bitcoin ferait mieux que le dollar si la Fed se met à faire n'importe quoi. C'est un pari sur l'intelligence des gestionnaires des banques centrales. 

Moi ce qui m'intéressait beaucoup dans le bitcoin, c'est le coté décentralisé et anarchiste.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;Their famous ""Salaryman"" business culture which dominates much of life was orignially an American import.

The word ""Salaryman"" is an American import. Behind it you can find the traditional Japanese culture where a company has replaced a clan^1 . You give your loyalty and all the free time you have against a paycheck -- and at least a generation back, company's employees might decide together who they will vote in elections as well.

&gt;If they wish to remain relevant, then they will have to drop the xenophobic trait in their culture and accept immigration. 

The biggest problem Japan has is that their culture expects women to retire from employment (and to certain extend from public life) after marriage (or after the first child, as the things may be), which many aren't willing to do. 

Even if Japan's population is going down (and they have a huge problem with the increasing amount of elderly) this doesn't mean the END of Japan. Rising population isn't the same as relevancy (ask any developing country) nor is smaller population indication of irrelevancy (ask any European country - they're pretty much all smaller than Japan). And when we're talking of ""small"" what we mean is still ""bigger than Germany"". 

Japan has a strong company sector that brings in a lot of money (on areas that aren't going to vanish anytime soon). You can leverage that to many things during coming decades. 

Not to mention that Japan is situated around many developing countries where you can easily outsource stuff while not going far away (such as South Korea and Taiwan).

&gt;Depending on the career path I choose, I may move to Taiwan. Job prospects in Academia for specialist in Western history are very good there. I would also consider China too, if it wasn't a dictatorship.

I fully agree with this statement. My point there was that the 26-2 vote does not accurately reflect the support and opposition Juncker had. That's one reason why revisiting the procedure is a good idea. Revisiting does not mean removing it. Rather, the process could be made more open from the beginning (e.g. open leadership elections) and it could be formally enshrined. For example, Cameron's opposition (and for the record he did it very badly) was not technically wrong. The Council was not bound to appoint Juncker.

As a concession to the Yugoslavian side, Bulgarian authorities agreed to the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity and language as part of their own population in the Bulgarian part of geographical Macedonia. This was one of the conditions of the Bled Agreement. The policies resulting from the agreement were reversed after the Tito–Stalin split in June 1948, when Bulgaria, being subordinated to the interests of the Soviet Union was forced to take a stance against Yugoslavia

I am firmly against direct leadership elections. The idea that the populace votes for their representative and they in turn decide on who is going to lead them is the de-facto norm in almost all modern democracies. Replacing that with the much more dated concept of presidential elections - like in the USA - would give this position an amount of legitimacy that's neither necessary nor desirable. Direct legitimacy may sound good, but it leads to a whole bunch of problems (for example he would have *higher* legitimacy than for example the German chancellor and *much* higher legitimacy than the German president) and the position itself doesn't really call for that. It would also mean a *massive* shift of power towards the bigger EU countries, foremost Germany.

true,metroxed,null,null,"&gt;Is it a nice place to live?

Pamplona (Iruñea in Basque) is the capital city of Navarre, one of the communities (if not ""the one"") with highest life quality of Spain. I'd say it is a pretty good place to live, lots of green areas and historical buildings, as well as a fascinating culture. It is within the realm of the Basque regions, so you should expect a very interesting culture, landscapes, architecture (especially in rural northern Navarre, if you live in Pamplona you should really visit).

&gt;What's the food like?

The cuisine is good, as it is in most of Spain and particularly in areas of Basque influence. 

&gt;Is there a good nightlife/social scene? Or will I get bored?

I don't think you'll get bored. The old town probably has a very cool nightlife, but be mindful that we're talking about a middle-sized city. There won't be as many events and things as there would be in bigger cities. Apart from that, the city is located within a region where you can do tons of things, if you don't mind moving outside the city a bit. The northern rural areas are beautiful, the Pyrenees are very close if you like hiking or just camping, etc., Donostia-San Sebastian is 1h30min or so by car if you want to go to the beach or just try Basque cuisine. Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz are not far either. It is common for people from these cities (I'm from Bilbao) to move back and forth every time there are big events, especially now in the summer. 

&gt;I've gathered it's a bit expensive and cold compared to the rest of Spain

Yes, it is colder, you should be mindful of that. Don't expect it to be like Barcelona or southern Spain. Those places have a Mediterranean climate, while Pamplona has an Atlantic climate. The spring and summer should be warm enough though. ",0,1404042590,null,0,false,0,cijz8hc,t3_29drgt,t1_cijz8hc,t3_29drgt,null,1434457000,7,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,7

###Here's the Solidarity Clause:

---

##Article 222

1. The Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster. The Union shall mobilise all the instruments at its disposal, including the military resources made available by the Member States, to:
    
 *(a)* - prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member States;

 \- protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack;

 \- assist a Member State in its territory, **at the request of its political authorities**, in the event of a terrorist attack;

 *(b)* - assist a Member State in its territory, **at the request of its political authorities**, in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.


2. Should a Member State be the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster, the other Member States shall assist it at the request of its political authorities. To that end, the Member States shall coordinate between themselves in the Council.


3. The arrangements for the implementation by the Union of the solidarity clause shall be defined by a decision adopted by the Council acting on a joint proposal by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The Council shall act in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Treaty on European Union where this decision has defence implications. The European Parliament shall be informed.
For the purposes of this paragraph and without prejudice to Article 240, the Council shall be assisted by the Political and Security Committee with the support of the structures developed in the context of the common security and defence policy and by the Committee referred to in Article 71; the two committees shall, if necessary, submit joint opinions.

4. The European Council shall regularly assess the threats facing the Union in order to enable the Union and its Member States to take effective action.

###And here's the part from the Treaty on European Union:

---

##Article 31

1. Decisions under this Chapter shall be taken by the European Council and the Council **acting unanimously**, except where this Chapter provides otherwise. The adoption of legislative acts shall be excluded.

 When abstaining in a vote, any member of the Council may qualify its abstention by making a formal declaration under the present subparagraph. In that case, it shall not be obliged to apply the decision, but shall accept that the decision commits the Union. In a spirit of mutual solidarity, the Member State concerned shall refrain from any action likely to conflict with or impede Union action based on that decision and the other Member States shall respect its position. If the members of the Council qualifying their abstention in this way represent at least one third of the Member States comprising at least one third of the population of the Union, the decision shall not be adopted.

As for the ""good things Hitler did"", there are some misconceptions. The economy improved, but arguably it had bottomed out already and was already improving right around when he came to power. The Nazis accelerated this through their infrastructure projects and military spending, but the problem was that this excessive deficit spending (Mefo bills etc.) was unsustainable, to the point where the transition to a war economy became inevitable. The Nazis had to rely on plundering occupied countries, forced labor and seized property to keep the economy going.  
They didn't even have a coherent economic policy. The one they did have (Gottfried Feder's theory of ""two kinds of capital"", i.e., ""privately owned businesses grown through your own work: good; gaining interest on loans or financial investment: bad"") was abandoned before they even came to power, to gain the backing of some rich industrialists who didn't like his ideas at all.

The other often cited ""good things"" tend to be at least ""dual use"". The Volkempfänger radios served the propaganda machine, KdF vacations and apolitical movies were necessary to keep up morale at the home front, and pretty much as soon as the Volkswagen factories were ready for production they were switched over to produce cars for the military. Work on the autobahn network had started before the Nazis, against their initial opposition.

true,adinadin,RUSS,Russia | Please correct my English,"I don't see any realistic way for Russian state to change its policy, because all the Putin's power is shared with his friends. He appointed trusted people on all the ministers, judjes, governors, state corporations top posts. The system is self-sustaining and if putin suddenly dissapear they will choose a successor like Yeltsin (more precisely the Family) did, and whoever he would be he would be successfully elected since propaganda and rigged elections are smoothly running mechanisms already.

These people know that they are criminals and if something would go wrong (lost control) they would flee from Russia with all their capitals to avoid retribution. Also we have  federal districts and regions including Caucasus and some far eastern regions like Tuva which would declare separation once there would be no money to pump into, and some richer ones like Tatarstan and other oil/gas producing regions may want to separate too to not share their economy. I'm not a fan of holding territories forcefully, but economic consequences would be terrible. So I don't expect any turn to the better without massive crisis first like that in early 90's.

On the other hand Ukraine showed that you can takeover the corrupted state without a massive disasters, we surely have China which can play like Russia did in Ukrainian conflict but I hope they have no territorial claims after Putin gave them thousands km^2 worth of islands they were asking for for a century.

Anyway don't take my words seriously since I don't really know much about politics and economy, it's just the most obvious and mutually hot topic now to talk about with westerners, and I need practicing English, for possible emigration of course :)

There's a lot of interesting places, starting from Genova, which is worth visiting. Camogli, where you should totally taste some facaccia di Recco and have a couple camogliesi (an almond dessert). From there, if you feel like, you can take a boat to punta Chiappa, San fruttuoso and all the way to Portifino. 

On your way south I'd pick Sestri Levante since it's a truly unique place and 5 terre.

Once you reach Tuscany I'd leave the coast and go visit Lucca, then proceed driving in the countryside or go back to the coast to visit Pisa (not much to see aside from the tower, but that sure is an iconic place and easily reachable) and Livorno (Has a beautiful terrace on the sea) and then leave the coast again to reach Volterra. I strongly suggest you leave the big roads and take the small ones, Tuscany's countryside is beautiful and worth travelling through at a relaxed pace. From there head to San Gimignano and Siena next. After Siena you can either go straight to lake Trasimeno or go a bit out of your way to visit Arezzo and then head for the lake. If you've never been there go to Perugia and then to your destination :)

I named an insane amount of places, check some of them out :P

As for the no prebooking, I think you can do that, but try to go a bit out of the way not to spend too much, like don't sleep in a famous place, but pick a small town nearby.

Juncker wasn't chosen as candidate by the EP. He was chosen as a candidate by the EPP and then as the de facto only candidate by the voters. The council could have tried to rewind this and present their own candidate but the EP would realistically never have gotten through with something like this (i.e. saying Juncker is a nice guy but we will only accept Barnier).

If the heads of government would want to rewind this now they'd first and foremost need to prevent their party families from presenting a candidate next time. If there is none, the EP won't have a candidate to endorse either. If there is, things will play out as they did this time.

Bahaha you are full of shit, called out on what you weed smoking moron, with the exception of London (which I had already talked about above) nearly all these cities have something like a 70%-85% majority of the population being native. 

On top of that the non-natives are *usually* all white. 

On top of that if you go to any of the ""non designated for immigration"" smaller cities the native population will be at 95%+.

I know Greeks moving out to small towns in England or Germany and if that town didn't have a university then ""everyone would be looking at me as if I was weird"". 

And on top of that the whole immigration, only heavily started after the break up of the eastern wall. It's not part of a 100 year old history as in the US. A large percent of the immigrants in the big european cities currenttly don't even get to partticipate in an election. They haven't even mixed yet to be blunt about it.

I have several friends that have graduated as vets so I was a bit drawn into their world. AFAIK, there's plenty of work for veterinarians and vet techs in industry (cows, pigs etc.). The easiest place to find that kind of job is the Po Valley, but there is work to be found all over.

If you are geared more towards pets, I'm told the market is pretty saturated at the moment. Not to say that you couldn't find an open spot, but it won't be as easy as it would be going into industry.

Now for the less pleasant part, vet techs do not get particularly enticing entry-level salaries compared to vets. We are talking about 1000€-1100€ (after tax, monthly), which is very respectable compared to the average Italian salary but you certainly won't be swimming in gold. Of course, if you manage to find employment with a high-end care center or something like that, you could certainly find something better paying.

La maggior parte della gente che compra cellulari da 6-700€ lo fa con un abbonamento e in quel caso non pagano quasi mai il costo completo. Ti faccio un esempio:

Samsung Galaxy S5, 700€ da Mediaworld

Lo puoi prendere con abbonamento TOP Unlimited di 3 a 49€ + 25€/mese * 30 mesi

Fa conto che, senza abbonamento, questa persona spenderebbe circa 15€/mese di telefonate\sms\internet.

Il Costo del solo telefono allora diventa 49€ + 10€/mese * 30 mesi = 349€

Inoltre, alla fine dei 30 mesi il telefono lo rivendi usato; basandomi sui modelli di fascia alta passati (stessi prezzi), lo rivendi tranquillamente intorno ai 200€ (per stare bassi).

Quindi in pratica il telefono lo hai pagato 149€, o 349€ se non lo rivendi (nel qual caso sei scemo).

Poi oh, io odio gli abbonamenti e compro cellulari usati a 6-12 mesi dall'uscita per metà del prezzo iniziale facendomi grasse risate, però non credo che chi si fa l'abbonamento per il cell nuovo sia un coglione.

Cmq gli smartphone di fascia alta hanno un loro senso: ti permettono di utilizzare al meglio le ultime tecnologie, che per alcune persone può essere fondamentale. Io sono un drogato di smartphone e lo uso massicciamente per gestire email, IM, progetti collaborativi, agenda personale, agenda aziendale, appuntamenti, navigazione GPS, foto, scansione documenti, navigazione su internet.

[Here's an infographic](http://static.euractiv.com/files/eu_presidential_debates_2014_latest.pdf) with the main EU Presidential debates. The one that aired here is the one on the 15th of May, aired with live dubbing by most EBU member channels, including RTP. I actually watched most of those debates (including the ones in German), as I speak fluent German too. ~~I'm trying to find a full list of channels who aired this debate, but I can't seem to find the debate's official web-page anymore, sorry.~~ EDIT: [Here.](http://www.eurovisiondebate.tv/about/#) Check the list of broadcasters (""Where to watch it""), or more detailed [here](http://www.eurovisiondebate.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FAQs_BroadcastersListVA.pdf). In the UK, BBC Parliament seems to have aired it. Funnily enough, it even aired on Ukraine national TV!

There was a huge investment these elections by the EUParl, EBU and other european news broadcasters like euronews to have multiple presidential debates (to try and legitimize the candidates), but the debates were mostly ignored by many countries, like the UK. Most of these debates were offered to european TV channels, but other than the one on the 15th May by the EBU, many channels chose *not to air them* because ""they didn't interest their viewers"" or some crap like that. They were all live-streamed online for free, though, and discussed in this sub-reddit.

Looking at that infographic, can you guess why in Germany public opinion was mostly on Juncker's (and the spitzenkandidaten's) side? I'll give you a hint - there were two german-language debates financed by and aired on german TV, on top of the rest of the debates.

&gt;As to the democratic deficit, it would be hypocritical if you were happy for things to stay the same, but most British people don't want to see it stay the same, they want reform to go in the other direction.

Thing is, that's what most were campaigning for in the other thread - let's let the Council keep choosing unelected bureaucrats, because *democracy*.

Also, with this new system, the ECR or/and the EFDD could put forward a candidate and if he's elected democratically by the EP (it's possible such a candidate could gather plenty of support EU-wide during EU elections), then that would be a clear democratic mandate to dismantle the current system of the EU back towards a less politically integrated system. You can not say the same of the previous system, though. From this you can easily conclude which is the more democratic system.

Note that I'm not saying the new system is perfect - far from that, actually. But it's improving!",0,1404060935,null,0,1404065255,0,cik4d00,t3_29dtb8,t1_cik4d00,t1_cik44r5,null,1434460397,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

* Perché l'ho fatto? Perché potevo farlo. All'epoca avevo accumulato qualche soldino guadagnato tramite AdSense su progettini web vari, e avevo voglia di farmi un regalo con soldi miei, senza aver bisogno di chiederli ai miei genitori (sono uno studente), cosa che peraltro non avrei mai fatto.

* Sì ma perché non cinema/viaggi/puttane e champagne? Perché la necessità di avere uno smartphone era più impellente. Sì, necessità: con buona pace dei neopauperisti, oggigiorno non avere in tasca un aggeggino che ti permetta di andare su internet quando vuoi significa complicarsi enormemente la vita quotidiana. Non credo ci sia il bisogno di spiegare perché.

* Ma perché non qualcosa di più economico? Perché volevo il top di gamma, cosa che in quel periodo l'iPhone 4 senza dubbio era. Me lo ricordo cosa ci compravi con 200-300€, nel 2010-2011: cacatine dallo schermo minuscolo a risoluzione ridicola (3G/3GS compresi), robe bruttissime sulle quali la risposta ai tap e agli swipe richiedeva qualche secondo, accrocchi con fotocamere e altoparlanti indegni. Insomma tutti cellulari che avrei finito per trovare insostenibili dopo uno o due anni, arrivando quindi a sostituirli - quasi sicuramente con modelli di fascia superiore, stanco della precedente esperienza - e spendendo quindi complessivamente di più.
Invece, come dicevo, l'iPhone 4 lo uso ancora ed è un signor telefono, anche perché sono molto attento nell'usarlo (non è mai caduto e non ha un graffio).
Per carità, la differenza con i modelli attualmente disponibili è enorme, e infatti medito da tempo di cambiarlo.

But conflict didn't end with fight by locals, but with referendum, dictated by rulers writing Treaty of Versailles. I will not go into details, but Austria won the referendum, even though most of inhabitants in Carinthia (especially peasants) were Slovene. I heard many theories about false votes on referendum, but i believe austrians just had better propaganda.

Però mi pare che tu stia implicitamente ponendo un limite di disponibilità economica del tipo ""con sta crisi (ma anche con un lavoro) perché spendere 700 euro per uno smartphone quando uno da 300 fa le stesse cose?"" perché se non lo stai ponendo questa condizione il ragionamento si annulla in partenza visto che comunque a quel punto il ragionamento sarebbe inverso (cioè ""perché comprarne uno da 300 se posso comprarne uno da 700?).
Tutto questo per dire che non importa se il PC da 700 euro non è il top: 700 euro rimangono 700 euro e in relazione alle tue tasche pesano uguale.

&gt;Personalmente noto molto di più la differenza di performance fra medio-buono ed eccellente su un computer che su un telefono. Alla fine quello che fa l'S5 lo fa anche l'S4.  

Qua però ci sono delle cose da precisare: la prima è che non stai ponendo un confronto tra smartphone da 300 euro e uno da 700 ma due smartphone della stessa fascia di prezzo di due generazioni diverse. A ciò bisogna aggiungere che dopo un certo punto avviene una sorta di saturazione, nel senso che diventa difficile sentire le differenze ed è ciò che è successo da quando si è raggiunta l'ultima generazione di chipset snapdragon 800 - Aqualcosa di Apple, quello sul 5S, che ormai sono mostruosi e dai prossimi anni le differenze di prestazioni inizieranno a sentirsi meno sull'esperienza utente nonostante ci sia circa un raddoppio annuale (ce lo vedi per esempio facebook a richiedere doppia potenza di calcolo?).
Inoltre S4 e S5 sono forse gli smartphone con minor differenza che  tu potessi citare. Se fai un paragone con S3 e S4 tranquillo che la differenza si sente o anche tra galaxy Nexus e Nexus 4.
Andando a confrontare quelli di fascia bassa e fascia alta invece il discorso diventa già più complesso: iniziamo col dire subito che la fascia bassa di Apple non esiste. Se guardiamo android invece si tratta spesso di telefoni mediocri e solo ultimamente stanno uscendo telefoni a basso prezzo validi (es. Moto G). Il problema di questi telefoni è che mancano spesso di qualcosa e si finisce col dealbreaker: può essere l'LTE, qualche sensore o ricevitore come la mancanza del GPS Glonass, la memoria ridotta  ecc. inoltre non bisogna dimenticare due fattori molto importanti: display e fotocamera, i primi spesso piccoli e la seconda pessima.

Ho un S2 che mi è stato regalato alla cresima (ad ottobre 3 anni) al quale per sfortuna ho rotto lo schermo (il vetro superiore, il resto funzia). Pagato 600€ perchè era appena uscito e regalatomi da i miei due zii e mio nonno (90% mio nonno hahaha). Dopo 3 anni la batteria è arrivata e, data anche la rottura dello schermo - 150€ per ripararlo mortacci vostra Sam(gui)sug(he) - sono arrivato alla conclusione di cambiarlo. Budget massimo 350€ e sinceramente è anche troppo. Con quella cifra ci si può comprare un telefono con i controcazzi (vedi LG G2, Huawei Honour 6, One Plus One) e comunque pagare un telefono, qualunque esso sia, a prezzo pieno secondo me è veramente da rincoglioniti. Se qualcuno ha le palle di dirmi che nei negozi tipo MediaWorld o Euronics si risparmia più che su internet gli arriva un calcio rotante sulle gengive. Detto ciò c'è comunque gente che lo fa e ti voglio raccontare una piccola storia:

- Gianni di Gregorio : [Le Dejeuner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1277728/?ref_=nv_sr_1), peut-être pas mon préféré dans la liste mais un petit film qui vaut le détour.

- les films d'Emanuele Crialese ([Respiro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286516/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), [Terraferma](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641410/?ref_=nv_sr_1)...), attention en grande partie en dialecte, mais ils font partie de mes films préférés toutes nationalités confondues (en tout cas Respiro que j'ai dû voir 10 fois)

- [Paolo Sorrentino](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Sorrentino) (tous !! J'aime énormément ce réalisateur),
[Le conseguenze dell'amore](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398883/) s'il ne faut en voir qu'un. Tu en ressors un peu chamboulé, c'est du Cinéma avec une majuscule, très beau très fin et très maitrisé. 

- [Gabriele Salvatores](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Salvatores), là aussi j'aime vraiment tous ses films, qui recouvrent des genres assez différents (de la comédie avec [Puerto Escondido](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105188/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) à la SF cyberpunk avec [Nirvana](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119794/?ref_=nv_sr_1). Je conseille SURTOUT [Io non ho paura](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326977/?ref_=nv_sr_1) un petit film adapté d'un bouquin tourné à hauteur des yeux des enfants qui en sont les protagonistes.

- [Marco Tullio Giordana](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Tullio_Giordana), surtout pour [Les cent pas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238891/) qui est magnifique.

- [Dopo Mezzanotte](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402141/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (Après minuit) de Davide Ferrario est sympa, film qui se passe dans le musée du cinéma de Turin.

- [Habemus Papam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1456472/?ref_=nv_sr_1) de Nanni Moretti sur un pape qui ne veut pas être pape. Ses autres films aussi mais il faut aimer le genre qui peut sembler un peu autoréférentiel parfois.

- Les films de [Ferzan Ozpetek](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferzan_Ozpetek) assez bien, c'est le petit chouchou du festival de Villerupt.

- [Fortapasc](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1272011/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) de Marco Risi sur un journaliste abattu par la mafia, beau film.

- [Pain et tulipes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237539/) (?) de Silvio Soldini

La differenza fra un Nexus 5 e un iPhone 5S, Galaxy S5 (etc.) ne vale altri 300?

Al contempo sui computer i ritorni ci sono eccome, anche se non nella performance intesa come number crunching.

Retirement in Greece has never been below 60-65 . . Corrupt Public Sector workers who had connections DID retire at 50-55 and this was used as ""proof"" for everyone. 

And why the fuck would Greece be grateful? 

Germany played Greece like a fiddle and is laughing all the way to the Bank. 

They Bribed Greek officials to buy overpriced German MIlitary equipment every year for last two decades and got into 250 Billion debt because of this . . then went Debt Crisis happened . . they give us Predatory Loans to PAY them AGAIN for this  Military Equipment WITH interest. . . so basically we payed twice for this Military equipment.

Also, before any German blasts me . . I am not angry at Germany at all . . this is simply how the ""Game"" Works and Greece learned some extremely valuable lessons from this experience which has been used to Modernize our political system and government.

In the future Greece will play the role of Germany to smaller countries . . as the Oil/Gas money comes floding in around 2020, we will be the ones selling Military Gear(mostly Advanced Drones/Tanks) and then giving out ""Bail-Outs"" :)

&gt;In office




&gt;21 October 1981 – 2 July 1989


&gt;13 October 1993 – 17 January 1996

&gt;The expenditure programme of the Papandreou government during 1981–1990 has been described as excessive by its conservative critics. The excessive expenditures were not accompanied by corresponding revenue increases and this led to increases in budget deficits and the public debt. Many economic indicators worsened during 1981–1990 and the economic policies of his government were condemned as a failure by his critics.

Second: Ask first to workers of shops that sell souvenirs, they are used to that question. If its a small village ask to the one who sells bread most of the life of small villages happens around them so they know about places and are likelly to be patient with not-so-good-spanish. Also gass stations, there is one every 40 or 50 miles and at the entrance of small villages (more than 20 houses and there is one for sure). 
If you are on the road: anyone who has a walking cane.

Third: draw, make gestures, and speak as many things in spanish as you can even if its wrongly, even the most stuborn country old fashioned men will help you if they notice that you are trying to use spanish. Also, firm hand shake when saying thanks.

Fourth: if you get one with bad manners, remind yours, maybe they don't know english but they aren't stupid and know when someone is badmouthing them, so wait till they are away to say ""man that was a rude ooneee"".

Now, places that aren't meant to be for sleep but will take you in: any, if you are asking to a villager just show a simple gift, don't offer money but do show polite behaviour and good manners, say thanks always one more time than necessary. Ladys in their 50 are more likelly to take you in if you use the ""im a lost youngster"" face and they are likelly to help you out. In case of doubt, go to the local Bar, offer beer and ask if they know someone that woldn't mind to let you sleep in their couch.

Never say Señora to any lady, even if they are 90 years old say ""Perdone señorita"", if its a man say ""Perdone caballero"" if he looks past his 40, if is someone younger than you a ""Perdona"" and then you ask no need for formalities there. Spanish don't take formalities too seriously, but they do mind manners when strangers aproach. This is mostly to get points for them to think ""this one is a nice boy"" and trust you, it really isn't a requeriment, people here don't mind that much about how they are adressed.

The common spaniard is stubborn no matter whats the topic, if they are under 40 they will try to use a little english but will hesitate, under 30 they will try hard and fail hard, under 20 don't spect to be understod but do spect a lot of trying hard to understand you, older than 50....gestures lots of them! most people of that age didn't take education with a secondary language (because politics and stuff happened then) be patient with them.

The common spaniard no matter age or place will aprreciatte your efforts in speaking their language even if you say ""Holas Como esta yo?"" so don't be shy and use it all.

As others there answered before the key words are: Albergue, Dormir, Porfavor, Disculpe, Lugar, Camping, Cerca, Cama, hostal barato, ¿donde está el baño?, ¿Hay un pueblo cerca que tenga un lugar donde dormir? (hard one but usefull), oficina de información, oficina de turismo, autobus turistico (bus turistico).

Also mind that in Spain you can't put your tent in places where aren't meant for camping wich are: all but those with the big caps sing saying CAMPING OVER HERE. And you have to pay for it, they are cheaper if they have less stars but mind the stars here they meant ""bathroom is awesome"" or ""go poop to the woods"". If in an emergency do it not to close to an habitated area, you can get a bill for it so try not to. Just the sack is also not allowed but you are likelly to not get a bill if you put a ""im a good boy and im so so sorry agent"" face. 

Albergues are the cheapest option : 5 euros, or even less if you get the ""camino de santiago"" pilgrim credential. Its mostly a bed and shared toilet.
Campings second cheapest option, they are good, safe, have toilet, some privacy.
Aparta-hotel: instead of a hotel room you get the whole appartment, if you travel alone isn't a good option, but for groups is increadibly cheap and you get a kitchen fridge and everything!
Hostal its not cheap but is cheaper than an hotel.
Hotel not cheap, expensive or not depends on stars.
Paraderos: reaaally not cheap if you travell alone, not recomended for low budget.
Casas rurales: some are cheap others aren't depends ont he owner, if you are alone look it up or ask but don't get your hopes up.

In the Picos de Europa the amount of campings is high so:

http://www.campings.net/ 
http://www.picos-europa.com/

I recomend that you visit the Lagos de Somiedo (Lakes of Somiedo) its a great view, nice people, awesome food also lakes, Cudillero has a great camping on the coastline and cheap, the Cuencas Mineras natural park has nice trecking paths that follow the old train trails with tunnels, Taramundi is a must http://www.taramundi.es/donde-dormir .

And to get ice for cooling things: gass stations, campings, and almost any supermarket (look for Consum, Eroski or Mercadona they are cheap and common).

Spect: random cows, sheeps,horses coming from no where, unexpected cold at night(warm socks are a must) and humidity (wear a raincoat in the bag rather than an umbrella), lots of heat at midday, spending all your money on healthy fatty food, random sings of paint left by local scout groups on trees and trecking paths ( http://www.sendasyrutas.com/senalizacion-senderismo.html like those), fountains lots of them to refill your bottle, cheap bike rentals spots, lots of places to take a swim break in the middle of the montains all for yourself.

Don't spect: trash cans bring your own for-trash-disposal bag, dangerous wild life, eating vegetarian style even if they have that.

So after banging my head against the brick wall with the staff of my building I also tried the residents committee. Problem with them is that all they really do is organise social gatherings and other events and talk very little about the actual welfare of people who live there.

America can invade half the middle eat, but not remove a few groups of men in Ukraine? it smells of bad fish!!!

who causing the trouble here? I think it's obvious! but when innocent people have been killed in the streets.. it's pretty serious... If people had been killed in your country, what would you have done about it?

&gt;If we see this rule getting broken, we will give a warning and ban those who continue to engage in this type of behavior.

I think this should be something like;

* Please don’t be rude, and please keep conversation on the topic, and don't attack the other person. By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us.

* Conversations that consist of nothing but name-calling will be removed and the users warned and if the behavior persists banned (temporarily and permanently).

also this should be there:

* If a post is of good quality/well argumented, but you throw in a ""You're a moron!"" we will still remove the comment until the insult is deleted.

&gt;Don’t tag posts as “x-post from” in the headline. All content linked on reddit comes from elsewhere. Where you originally saw content is not of general interest. If you want to add such information do it in the comment section, not the title.

I'm not convinced this is needed.

----

Some other things: 

* Besides self-nominations, I think the community should have the chance to nominate mods as well. In fact, I highly encourage it, with the clear specification that the unltimate choice is still our. I don't think we should import mods from other subs. It's not like David was welcomed with open arms.

* it should be made clear that being arrogant with the mods will not get them unbanned.

* I think bans should take into account post history of the user (maybe you all do this but just wanted to write it down just in case).

* I think we should at least answer the question ""Why was I banned"" with the reason and the post which sparked the ban, even if we don't answer after that. I'm willing to do it, if you guys don't wanna.

* I think we should engage more with the community. Even giving public warnings more often could make us look more visible. I get the feeling people don't notice our work, and I wouldn't mind us getting a bit more sympathy from the community.

One last thing. I haven't gotten the chance to familiarize myself with the Moderator Toolbox, so I can't really say anything about that yet.

* Dai 200€ in su le prestazioni minime sono sufficienti per compiere le operazioni piú comuni (sms, internet, socials, whatsapp).

* sull'aumento del prezzo per il consumatore influiscono le qualitá della fotocamera (che a me interessa) e dello schermo. Questi due elementi oltre a certi valori per me sono solo puro marketing (20megapixel su un sensorino microscopico sono inutili cosí come il 4k su un monitor da 5 pollici).

* Io sono felice del constante miglioramento delle tecnologie, ma sarei piú felice se prima di tutto ci fosse **ottimizzazione**. Per i prodotti consumer bisogna saper distiguere cosa é marketing e cosa no: da una parte c'é un certo tipo di marketing che punta ai numeroni come specchietti per le allodole, dall'altra parte c'é l'ingegnere che dovrebbe puntare tutto sull'ottimizzazione e semplificazione per avere le massime prestazioni. In poche parole se hai una Ferrari devi saperla guidare.

Da questo punto di vista apprezzo molto il lavoro svolto da Nokia con WindowsPhone ma anche la tecnologia Pureview che unisce marketing e prestazioni.

* Bisogna distiguere il prezzo di lancio dal prezzo di valore reale: per me i cellulari da alte prestazioni non dovrebbero costare piú di 350-400€ come prezzo onesto.

* É vero che i cellulari consentono ormai di fare cose che prima non potevamo nemmeno immaginare, ma spendere 700€ per un cellulare la cui batteria non dura nemmeno 10 ore e stare tutto il giorno attaccato al caricabatteria distruggendo poi in poco tempo la batteria, é una fregatura bella e buona per un oggetto che, in quanto portatile, dovrebbe puntare tutto sull'autonomia (questo si ricollega a quello che dicevo sull'ottimizzazione).

I remember I got headaches ( always kinda mild) when I used to go to the countryside and visit some old people and later I found out that it's because some old woman's look (the evil eye isn't really evil here btw) and some women have some effective prayer ( some kind of whispering and the forehead is massaged a bit) for it. After my mom does it, my headache goes away in a minute or so but you have to move a bit away from where your standing during prayer or w/e it is. For some reason not all women can use it well.

&gt; In Greece, the evil eye is cast away through the process of xematiasma (ξεμάτιασμα), whereby the ""healer"" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a grandparent.

yep, my grandma's is much better than my mom's.

&gt;There is another form of the ""test"" where the ""healer"" sets on fire using as a matchstick a clove. which is then thrown in water. If the clove ""explodes"" upon touching water the evil eye was cast. If it burns out silently it wasn't.

I remember some old relative for prayer used an empty cup ( or maybe it had a bit of water in it) and a burning matchstick in it. I don't think she used it for anything and it didn't help my headache.

true,NonNeHoIdea,campania,,"No, le forze dell'ordine ci sono dove devono esserci e fanno anche come possono il loro dovere, il problema è la mentalità che dilaga fra i ceti bassi, ignoranti e incivili. È probabilmente un sottoprodotto della mentalità napoletana di arrangiarsi (che è bellissima e davvero rende Napoli caratteristica) mista all'ignoranza: perchè il napoletano si arrangia e vede il metodo di aggirare il sistema per i propri fini, spesso in maniera illegale, e senza una cultura tale da fargli rendere conto che facendolo arreca danno a tutto il resto della popolazione, soprattutto se come lui lo fanno altre 100.000 persone, non si fa problemi e senza pensarci due volte lo mette in atto. E questo spiega almeno secondo me tutti gli scugnizzi che fanno le rapine,i parcheggiatori abusivi, camorristi e collusi.

Per quanto riguarda le denunce là non c'entra l'omertà (rima yo). Le denunce sono state, vengono, e saranno sempre fatte, ma ne arrivano così tante che non si sa più a chi andare dietro, cosa fare per arginare il fenomeno, se ne vale davvero la pena e non cercare di seguire indagini più importanti come quelle sulla criminalità organizzata etc. Del resto non puoi mettere in prigione 10.000 ragazzi perchè hanno rubato un cellulare o una 50 euro, chi lo ha il tempo per prenderli o i posti dove metterli? Chi ti dice che poi usciti dalla prigione non riprendano (cosa che succede praticamente sempre le poche volte che mettono dentro qualche criminale)? Secondo me una soluzione a breve termine non esiste, ed una a lungo termine se iniziata ad attuare adesso, cercando di divulgare un po' di cultura e consapevolezza civile, prima che abbia un effetto concreto bisognerà aspettare come minimo tre-quattro generazioni.

TL;DR: Deportiamo tutto il popolino di Napoli, bruciamoli tutti e ripopoliamo la città con gente che la sa apprezzare

Ho notato che tesi e antitesi della maggior parte delle discussioni lette qui su r/italy si basano su due concetti essenziali:

""Napoli è tra le città col più alto tasso di criminalità in Italia"" e ""Le precauzioni da prendere sono le stesse che nelle altre città"". 

Ora, il problema principale e la causa scatenante delle discussioni nasce dall'equivoco che si ottiene quando si considera uno di questi due concetti l'opposto dell'altro. In realtà i concetti sono probabilmente entrambi veritieri: se leggi con attenzione gli episodi raccontati da widonkadonk non contrastano affatto col primo post, sebbene ad una prima lettura possa sembrarlo.

La prima affermazione porterebbe alla conclusione che la probabilità di subire, ad esempio, una rapina a Napoli è più elevata che nelle altre città ma questo non vuol dire che quando si esce fuori di casa bisogna assumere atteggiamenti totalmente paranoici: probabilità più alta non significa certo che se incroci qualcuno per strada hai il 50% di possibilità che questi sia un rapinatore, si parla comunque di percentuali molto più basse.

In più vorrei far notare che mentre la prima frase ha una valenza molto più ""oggettiva"" (si basa principalmente su dati statistici), la seconda può essere confermata o smentita solo dall'esperienza diretta, ed è il motivo per cui tutti quelli che vivono qui te la ripeteranno fino allo svenimento. Inoltre è anche il motivo per cui faccio molta fatica a spiegare ciò che intendiamo, in effetti: il ""livello di attenzione"" non può essere certamente descritto esaurientemente a parole.

true,BrotherGA2,EURO,Italian-Brazilian-American,"Actually, parliaments have opposed proposals by the Commission with objections based on Principle of Subsidiarity before; it's not just words. 

&gt; National parliaments have so far twice collectively opposed  to European Commission proposals by giving a yellow card. The first time, the threshold was reached in May 2012 in the case of the Commission’s legislative proposal on the right to strike (Monti II). The Commission withdrew the proposal some months later. In November, national parliaments objected to the proposal to establish a European Public Prosecutor’s Office.

[source](http://epthinktank.eu/2014/01/20/eu-subsidiarity-check-by-national-parliaments/)

Also, it's unlikely that an EU law would even get passed that did not comply with the Principle of Subsidiarity due to the process of legislation; in fact, there hasn't been a single law that has had to be annulled by the Court of Justice.
&gt;Although the subsidiarity principle has been part of the Union's institutional life for over 15 years, Court of Justice case-law on this subject is quite small. It is unusual for the legality or validity of a Community legislative act to be brought before the Court for failure to comply with the subsidiarity principle, and to date the Court has never had occasion to annul a legislative act on these grounds.

&gt;This state of affairs is largely due to self-discipline on the part of the legislator, as well as to the fact that this principle does not really lend itself to judicial supervision.

Eat laks.

On 1st of March man give out ""martisoare"" to all the women they know. From their mother to the 70 year old neighbor. The most important part of it is the red and white string, not the jewel. 

The most common jewel designs are horseshoe, chimney cleaner or a snowdrop. 
Their price is fairly cheep, you can get 3-4 for 1 euro. 

Some people tend to buy more expensive ones (silver plated, gold plated), but in the last years there's been a nice resurgence of tradition and people accentuate the symbol (the red and white string) and dont care so much about the jewel. 

Most women will wear the string on their hand for a few weeks. In some regions the string is tied to the blossoming trees, to welcome the spring. ",0,1404078515,null,0,1404078853,0,cikbq6d,t3_29esn5,t1_cikbq6d,t3_29esn5,null,1434465238,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8
true,TheDukeofReddit,UNSA,United States of America,"Eh, is it that surprising? Portugal should not *want* its citizens to pick berries. These Portuguese should not be condemned for having a bad work ethic.  

Think of it like this.  Portugal 'invests' nearly [$7500 USD per student per year](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_605.10.asp).  The basic education system in Portugal lasts 9 years, although state spending with the aim of improving educational outcomes almost certainly happens both prior and after basic education this is nearly $67,000 USD.

Thailand actually spends quite a bit of its GDP on education.  However, if [this source is to be believed](http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/695289-thailands-educational-spending-highest-in-the-world/) it amounts to ~$1,000 USD.  They study for 12 years.  So over the course of their educational experience, the state is spending ~$13,000 USD per student.

While money spent is a poor indicator of educational outcomes, it does give a sense what subsequent income is expected. The Portuguese expect Portuguese to earn substantially more than the Thai do--they invested in what is 'necessary' to do so. Portugal's GDP per capita is ~$25,000, in Thailand its roughly $5,500.  It is not a surprise that Portugal spends about 5.5x as much on education when its GDP per capita is about 5x that of Thailand.  Its expected that Portuguese across all social strata will generally earn more.

To put it in another perspective, this is little different than the emigration Portugal itself has experience.  If you could, hypothetically, work in an office in Portugal for $15,000 a year or travel to Singapore to make $30,000 a year to do the same job, would you?  $30,000 isn't a lot in Singapore given the cost of living either. But live in a shitty apartment with roommates, spend as little as possible, and save up money? You would consider it. You might be able to save $10,000 a year, nearly as much as you would make in a year back home.  Now, what if its from $15,000 to $60,000? $75,000? At some point, what work you're doing doesn't even matter because you are extremely well compensated.  That is what it is like for the Thai travelling to Portugal to do agricultural work.  Asking the Portuguese to be as happy as the Thai is unreasonable unless they are as poor as the Thai.",0,1404078519,null,0,false,0,cikbq8x,t3_29embw,t1_cikbq8x,t3_29embw,null,1434465240,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Serbian Partizans were no more willing to kill the Germans in Vojvodina than the Yugoslav state itself.

Contradicts this:

&gt;the treatment that did happen was seen as reprisals for the Nazi occupation and the atrocities committed by Swabian volunteer units

So did they happen or not, and were they not somehow ""justified""?

&gt;The Soviet Union were also not ""Overlords""

They sure as hell were for the survivors when they fled to East Germany and Hungary.

I'm basing this from the firsthand account of my grandfather who grew up in the area. He told us about it well before there was much literature available, well before any of us could have just googled it. Make no mistake, they were targeting villagers, peasants, farmers. Not combatants. It was ethnic cleansing that might have been a splash compared to what else was going on in Europe, but it was still ethnic cleansing, and there is increasingly more literature available on it. A documentary was recently made as well.

So perhaps Serbian historians and schools would rather just ignore that inglorious piece of history. No problem, it's not like this generation was responsible. Hell, most descendants from who this happened to don't know about it, no one dared tell anything to the next generation that could catch the stalinist governments attention.

However, I am very skeptical as to what you mean that the existence of mass slaughters is controversial? What is questionable of the historicity of these graves, these eye witnesses? Maybe they didn't happen on a very large scale, but they sure as hell happened.

Make sure you're not saying that it didn't happen just because it paints your country in a bad light. My country killed a ton of our own citizens in that time period, mostly Jews. I am willing to admit this, I'm not going to lie to make it seem better.

true,tikli,FINL,Finland,"Oh Finland has lots and lots of pre-christian traditions. Even the supposedly Christian traditions have sometimes muddled and mixed with the older traditions. Like officially Midsummer, or ""juhannus"", is a Christian holiday in honor of St John the Baptist, but in reality the name just got tacked on a pagan festival. We celebrate Midsummer with bonfires, drinking, sauna and spells. 

Yes, spells. Usually fertility spells, but also spells that tell the future (though those are more common in the New Year's Eve). Here's few:

Collect seven (sometimes tree, five or nine, but always odd numbers) different wildflowers while naked and place them under your pillow. In dreams you will see the one you will marry.

Wearing only your nightshirt, sweep the floor of your bedroom and carry the dirt in the hem of your shirt to a pond. On your way home, you will meet the one who will become your beloved.

At the crossroads of three roads, sweep the ground naked, and your love will appear.

In the forest, lay in a bed of ferns. Seeing a fern bloom will bring good luck. If you collect the bloom, you can even become invisible.

And lots of more, usually involving running around naked and seeing or finding your future husband.

The most common spell is casting of tin around midnight on the New Year's Eve. The shape, shadow and the texture of the tin tells what to expect during the following year. [This is how it's done.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_MZUALzgOs) 

Then we have Easter bonfires, Christmas sauna, Night of the ancient fires... basically most of modern holidays have retained some (or all) of the older traditions.

Is some really passive aggressive shit. We're talking about innocent villagers being attacked in some sort of perceived retaliation for something non-villagers did. I hope to god you don't believe that killing civilians could ever be a valid retaliation for anything.

Maybe having it only keep an eye on Shengen, the free trade area and the like in the same way that organisations like the WTO, NATO, OPEC or more comparable organisations like mercosur/USAN, AU are governed by a much less direct democratic or an undemocratic system.

edit: I think a lot of them also forget that whilst a lot of them say that their politicians made it out to be just a free trade area and basically lied to them, if what they said back then was true it would still contain those ""cucumber and banana"" laws that parts of the British press so often ridicule whether correctly or not.

It's very unusual, in my experience, not to register so if you don't find anything I would suggest your wife to ask the parents of the groom. 
• As for the entertainment, it is customary for the bride and groom's parents, siblings and best friends to prepare something (speech, song, video, game, etc) to honor/roast the young couple. I have been to weddings with as much as a dozen such pieces of entertainment. You could be asked to join in (tape a segment in advance for a videoclip, sing along to a song, etc) but I would find it quite surprising I you were expected to just go and perform on your own. At least I've never experienced anything like that, and I've been invited to weddings in various regions of France, in Paris and in very rural areas and anywhere in between. Try and ask a bit more detail about that if you can.

true,Aurlios,WALE,Wales,"Mari Llwyd in Wales. 

It's similar to wassailing in that it's a new year celebration. Basically Mari Llwyd (gray mare) is a person dressed up in white cotton cloak and holds a horses skull. The skull is carved in triskles and Celtic knots and so on with the eye sockets filled either with candles, balls of cotton or baubles to make it less frightening for the children. The ribbons and bells are to help people see it in the night. The skull itself was originally given to the 'Mari Lwyd' during Pynwenta (spring festival) the previous year but thats rare now.

Anyway the whole point of the Mari Lwyd is that it's suppose to be either a blessing to the Goddess Rhiannon (goddess of horses) or a Kingship ritual (to reaffirm those still alive in the tribe). What happens is during the evening the Mari Lwyd goes knocking on house to house and, once the house door opens, a member of the family and the Mari Lwyd must fight through the use of Pwnco.

Pwnco is a type of poetic metre, similar to a singing riddle, one of many found only in Welsh tradition. The beginning is usually the same (here is a song based on it. http://youtu.be/11Q5zl6UwY4 ) but then they have to make it up as they go along. If the home owner loses they have to let the Mari Lwyd in for food, if the home owner wins the Mari Lwyd tries next door. 

Basically it to be honest lmao. Y Fari Lwyd is suppose to bring good luck to all, regardless if you win the pwnco or not (more of a pride thing).
