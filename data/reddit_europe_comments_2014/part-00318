Short answer: Yes. You lose EU citizenship and all EU rights. This is the only valid legal answer.Period.

If you want to keep it then you have to get citizenship of another EU Member State. Each State has different requirements for when granting citizenship, you'll have to look them up see if you can fulfill them.

It also depends if the UK would join the EEA and then things get more complicated. You'd not have EU citizenship, but you'd enjoy some EU rights. 

It also depends if a separate treaty gets negotiated between the UK and the EU which would affect the stay of foreigners already abroad or all UK citizens. This is pure speculation and not what you asked about.

Souvenirs you find in touristic shops in Rivoli, Elysee or any other souvenir shop are very different from souvenirs you find in Orsay museum, Rodin museum, Louvre,  Arc de Triomph and other well known museums. On one hand they're quality souvenirs (no, the pen prints are not going to rub off in your palm before you even reach the cashier), on the other hand, they scream more 'Paris!' than 'China!'. And quite honestly, the prices are not THAT high as for quality souvenirs. For example, in Orsay museum you can find beautiful umbrellas with prints of world-wide known paintings that are exposed in that museum, beautiful calendars, mugs, and etc. As a matter of fact, they even have an online boutique, so you can see what you'd find if you went to the museum giftshop. http://www.boutiquesdemusees.fr/fr/boutique/musees/musee-orsay/1?orderBy=new_asc If you want some freaky/cool stuff, you can go to the souvenirshop of the Catacombs ( erasers in the shape of a tooth, cool t-shirts related to skulls or so, etc. ). 

Otherwise I like raiding the museum of perfume (next to Opera Garnier), Fragonard.  They have a lot of quality products, made in France, you can buy small bottles of perfume which you can transport even in hang luggage, they can wrap anything you buy there as a gift too. Otherwise you can get a variety of nice smelling soaps,home scents, etc. They also have other boutiques next to Sacre Coeur and so on, where they sell some embroideries, pillow cases and what not, that look brilliant and normally are in French thematic (the giftshop of the museum of perfume has different items than all the rest of the shops they have in Paris).

What you mean isn't particularly ""German"" architecture. Half-timbered houses were a very widespread thing throughout the centuries, starting in the middle ages up until the early 20th century. Of course, there were regional differences though.  
The reason why there are/were so many of these buildings in Germany is because the area has been fairly densely populated and fairly wealthy for a very long time. Up until the second World War, most German cities had a very old city centre that looked like this. Today you can still see similar old town centres in Britain.  
  
Six-story buildings would definitely have been a rare exception. It would have been very difficult and very expensive to build such a structure. They would have been built in the city centre, around the central market place. This is where the most influential and wealthy citizens of the city lived. The city centre was also the place where building ground was the most expensive. You can compare it with skyscrapers of modern cities.  
  
I can't say much about the layout of the single houses. I assume the ground floor would probably house a shop, while the upper stories were living space. Most of the time, several generations lived in one house.  
Most of these houses would most certainly have a basement for storage space. However, main fuel for the fireplaces would mainly be coal. But that can depend on the time period. This coal would either come from coal mines or from charcoal burners. Coal would be delivered every couple of weeks by wagon. There would have been a small door that led from the street directly down into the basement. That's where the coals would have been brought down. At least, that's what it was like in the 19th and 20th century, I'm not sure about the time before.

&gt; The Red Army achieved its targets, vastly outnumbering Polish resistance and capturing some 230,000 Polish prisoners of war. The Soviet government annexed the territory under its control and in November 1939 made the 13.5 million formerly Polish citizens now under its control citizens of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union immediately started a campaign of sovietizing the newly acquired areas. This included staged elections, the results of which the Soviet Union used to legitimize its annexation of eastern Poland. The Soviets quelled opposition through summary executions and thousands of arrests.

Due to my ""rebelling"" I got attacked outside the hall and had my first school fight 2 days into my Canadian High School career.

That still doesnt answer the argument of the OP why would we ban it. The OP did a pretty bad job trying to defend itself(Sorry /u/dolcester but  no fucking links with genetical engineering and ear piercing) but still raises some fundamentals points on what are the reasons to ban it?

I agree some have raised ethical objections to parents making decisions about elective surgery on behalf of an infant, particularly when it is done primarily to protect against risks of HIV and STDs that do not occur until young adulthood. 

[But other ethicists have found it an appropriate parental proxy decision]
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12859815).


Also  I know most critics say we shouldn't be removing healthy body parts from infants, calling circumcision a trauma that can lead to decreased sexual function later in life. 


But the problems is that unlike other forms  child abuse , no psychological association around the world didnt find any meaningful trace of trauma on children life and studies show that its likely not a factor that would affect the child.

http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/¸

[Jewish cildren are more likely to be  psychologically healthy than European children]

(http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207597108246686#.VEwzP_mG-So). 



Also for the OP stats complication do not mean deaths...

A study of 136,000 boys born in US  hospitals between 1980 and 2005. 100,000 were circumcised and 193 (0.19%) had complications, mostly minor, with no deaths, but of the 36,000 who were not circumcised the problems were more than ten-times higher and there were 2 deaths.

www.[Wiswell &amp; Hachey, 1993].com



Lets not forget also that this issue before being an health issue  is a cultural one. Only 20% of european a circumsised but in North Amercia(Canada and USA) its more than 50%. The fact that one culture do not understand  what the other do may lead to some *imbroglios*. The principals reasons to keep it and America and Middle East  are cultural one.

 But the same thing could be said for Europe. Lets be honest the principals reasons to ban it in Europe are also cultural reasons and ethical reasons that are not base on logical studies. but the problem is that ethics could be  easily challenge as shown earlier.


To be honest some arguments use  in Europe are classics  [Think of the children] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children) or an appeal to emotion(sophism)

Most people that think circumcision cause them a lack of self-esteem or a trauma tought that circumsision was responsilbe for for their lack of sexual performance(Wich is false since studies have show  this is not links with circumcision)


[The overwhelming majority of women (97.1%) report either no change or improved sexual satisfaction after their male partner was circumcised. These findings suggest that male circumcision has no deleterious effect on female sexual satisfaction.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08683.x/full)

Adult male circumcision was not associated with sexual dysfunction. Circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm.(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08683.x/full)

[Adult circumcision does not adversely affect sexual function. The increase in the ejaculatory latency time can be considered an advantage rather than a complication.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429503009269)

&gt;[Circumcision does not appear to have adverse, clinically important effects on male sexual function in sexually active adults who undergo the procedure.](http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2805%2965097-5/abstract)


&gt;[Circumcision has either negative or positive effect on female’s partner perception of sexual satisfaction.](http://new.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/resumenMainI.cgi?IDARTICULO=40870)


&gt;[The highest-quality studies suggest that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sexual sensation, or satisfaction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12293/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false).

As for you /u/threep03k64  the author in the article that /u/dolcester links was not pro or against she mainly refute the pro idea but acknowledge that people that are against it do no have solid arguments. If you read clearfully her bottom line


&gt;Instead of coming down on one side of the debate, the Canadian Paediatric Society could help parents more by offering guidance that clearly spells out the potential advantages and risks of circumcision, without bias or omission.

She clearly understand how complex the debate is and as most logical people didnt take a side and chose the *status quo*



[The same Canadian Paediatric Society she was talking about set to soften stance on circumcision](http://globalnews.ca/news/402590/pediatricians-set-to-soften-stance-on-circumcision/)

*The organization isn’t recommending universal circumcision. Instead, it says the final decision should be left to parents.*

And some more.

As for you /u/Dolcester there is a middle ground between the ban of Europe and the the *American laissez-faire* its the Canadian one

 it's called *Brit Shalom*. It's a peaceful baby naming ceremony that more and more informed Jews are choosing, and it doesn't involve cutting off the most sensitive parts of the male penis and is an ideal middle ground. 

The World Jewish Congress and medical association around the world think its a clearly middle ground.

I understand the knee-jerk instinct to cry anti-Semitism, but I urge my fellow Jews to pause and question this ritual as rigorously as we question everything else. It's actually not that crazy to compare male circumcision to procedures in the umbrella term ""female genital cutting"", some of which are extremely more severe (infibulation), some of which are equally severe (a hoodectomy), and some of which have minimal severity (a pinprick to the clitoral hood). 

Framing the dialogue in terms of sex rather than by severity of the specific procedure is counterproductive. Furthermore, it should be recognized that labeling a genital cutting procedure as ""mutilation"" confers pejorative judgement of some outside culture's ritual, but all cutting cultures, whether it's the United States,Canada, Judaism, or muslims, refer to their own genital cutting procedures with the euphemism ""circumcision"", which confers positive judgement.

Before we can have a debate about the limitations of religious freedom, we must first be fully educated about medical ethics, sexual anatomy, and sexual health, for starters. To say that circumcision is harmless with health benefits is a naive uninformed perspective. That's okay - none of us are born experts on the topic, and we all have to learn about it at some point. For that claim, I recommend starting by googling ""Cultural Bias in the AAP's 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision"". If you allow reason to be your guide, you will find the intactivism movement, where your preconceived beliefs will be challenged.



I will definitely take the status quo(as most logical people) on this one and let the parents decide and that only a doctor would decide.

The difference was the fact that Poland and Soviet Union/Russian Empire had *quite a history* prior with Poland including Pilsudski ""adventures"" in Ukraine during Russian Civil War. To ignore international relations before and the global ""balance of power"" so to speak is a bit weird in my opinion. 


Countries always pursue their national interest, it is a natural state of things. No one bothered with morality or some sort of ""codes"" prior to WW2 (except maybe with chemical/bioweapon, but then again, Japan was nuked twice so i don't know which would be worse), hence ""detention facilities"" for ""potential 5th column"" in a variety of countries (including Canada, United States and others).


To judge Soviet Union actions by 21st century standards and ignoring or belittling the events *and actors* that **led to the situation** at all, is disingenuous and have very little in common with accurate picture of the world at the time or prior to it.


For modern people like us - idealogies, class struggle and capitalism vs communism sound stupid and something distant. For people of that time - Empires were a real fucking deal, India was a British colony, a shit ton of worker rights or social institutions did not exist, womens could not vote and many, many other stuff. To ignore the fact, that 70+ years ago **world was different on a fundamental level** makes for quite an inaccurate world picture and generalizations like donvito expressed (and which are quite popular on this sub it seems). This is my personal opinion, obviously, but i always try to look at things in context with prior development, not on a ""spherical horse in a vacuum"". Even current Russia did not materialized overnight, it had quite a history and the single most damaging factor would be 90s style of democracy if i were to make a call, but there were other events of course, so its always *not that simple*.

Well.. this is because arguing a silly position just so you can learn how to argue is silly.

Well.. guns and school shootings are less prevalent in Germany than in the US and all such protocols would accomplish is the over-profiling of harmless individuals.

Natural disaster protocols... well we don't have tornadoes, earthquakes or any other siginficant disasters except flooding. However flooding is usually predictable a long time ahead so there isn't exactly a need for a protocol.

That still doesnt answer the argument of the OP why would we ban it. The OP did a pretty bad job trying to defend itself(Sorry /u/dolcester but  no fucking links with genetical engineering and ear piercing) but still raises some fundamentals points on what are the reasons to ban it?

I agree some have raised ethical objections to parents making decisions about elective surgery on behalf of an infant, particularly when it is done primarily to protect against risks of HIV and STDs that do not occur until young adulthood. 

[But other ethicists have found it an appropriate parental proxy decision]
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12859815).


Also  I know most critics say we shouldn't be removing healthy body parts from infants, calling circumcision a trauma that can lead to decreased sexual function later in life. 


But the problems is that unlike other forms  child abuse , no psychological association around the world didnt find any meaningful trace of trauma on children life and studies show that is likely not a factor that would affect the child.

Also for the OP stats complication do not mean deaths...

A study of 136,000 boys born in US  hospitals between 1980 and 2005. 100,000 were circumcised and 193 (0.19%) had complications, mostly minor, with no deaths, but of the 36,000 who were not circumcised the problems were more than ten-times higher and there were 2 deaths.

www.[Wiswell &amp; Hachey, 1993].com



Lets not forget also that this issue before being an health issue  is a cultural one. Only 20% of european a circumsised but in North Amercia(Canada and USA) its more than 50%. The fact that one culture do not understand  what the other do may lead to some *imbroglios*. The principals reasons to keep it and America and Middle East  are cultural one.

 But the same thing could be said for Europe. Lets be honest the principals reasons to ban it in Europe are also cultural reasons and ethical reasons that are not base on logical studies. but the problem is that ethics could be  easily challenge as shown earlier.


Here:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12859815


To be honest some arguments use  in Europe are classics  [Think of the children] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children) or an appeal to emotion

Most people that think circumcision cause them a lack of self-esteem or a trauma tought that circumsision was responsilbe for for their lack of sexual performance(Wich is false since studies have show  this is not links with circumcision)


[The overwhelming majority of women (97.1%) report either no change or improved sexual satisfaction after their male partner was circumcised. These findings suggest that male circumcision has no deleterious effect on female sexual satisfaction.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08683.x/full)

Adult male circumcision was not associated with sexual dysfunction. Circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm.(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08683.x/full)

[Adult circumcision does not adversely affect sexual function. The increase in the ejaculatory latency time can be considered an advantage rather than a complication.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429503009269)

&gt;[Circumcision has either negative or positive effect on female’s partner perception of sexual satisfaction.](http://new.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/resumenMainI.cgi?IDARTICULO=40870)


&gt;[The highest-quality studies suggest that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sexual sensation, or satisfaction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12293/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false).

And some more.

As for you /u/Dolcester there is a middle ground between the ban of Europe and the the *American laissez-faire* its the Canadian one

 it's called *Brit Shalom*. It's a peaceful baby naming ceremony that more and more informed Jews are choosing, and it doesn't involve cutting off the most sensitive parts of the male penis and is an ideal middle ground. 

The World Jewish Congress and medical association around the world think its a clearly middle ground.

I understand the knee-jerk instinct to cry anti-Semitism, but I urge my fellow Jews to pause and question this ritual as rigorously as we question everything else. It's actually not that crazy to compare male circumcision to procedures in the umbrella term ""female genital cutting"", some of which are extremely more severe (infibulation), some of which are equally severe (a hoodectomy), and some of which have minimal severity (a pinprick to the clitoral hood). 

Framing the dialogue in terms of sex rather than by severity of the specific procedure is counterproductive. Furthermore, it should be recognized that labeling a genital cutting procedure as ""mutilation"" confers pejorative judgement of some outside culture's ritual, but all cutting cultures, whether it's the United States,Canada, Judaism, or muslims, refer to their own genital cutting procedures with the euphemism ""circumcision"", which confers positive judgement.

Before we can have a debate about the limitations of religious freedom, we must first be fully educated about medical ethics, sexual anatomy, and sexual health, for starters. To say that circumcision is harmless with health benefits is a naive uninformed perspective. That's okay - none of us are born experts on the topic, and we all have to learn about it at some point. For that claim, I recommend starting by googling ""Cultural Bias in the AAP's 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision"".

Klares Jein! 

&gt; Wie schon gesagt war die Entnazifizierung in Bezug auf die Kader intensiv, hörte allerdings schon bei nützlichen Leuten auf. Desweiteren wurde die Rolle der 17 Millionen Deutschen durch den Staat nicht hinterfragt. Zwar musste jeder Schüler mal eine KZ Gedenkstätte besuchen, was Pflicht war und wurde ständig mit Antifaschismus berieselt, allerdings wurde der normale Bürger nicht belangt. 

Antisemitismus und der Holocaust oder generell jüdisches Leben war auch kein großes Thema in der DDR. 

&gt; Die Schuldfrage war kein Thema. Und so entwickelte sich im Osten eine isolierte, völlig deutschzentrierte Gesellschaft, die sowohl kulturell auf deutschnationalem Niveau des Kaiserreichs stagnierte, als auch keine Einwanderung bzw. ""Vermischung"" kannte. 

Das mag teilweise Stimmen aber tendenziell gab es schon Einwanderer in der DDR u.A. Gastarbeiter aus Afrikanischen Ländern - der Umgang und Austausch mit diesen war aber ähnlich nicht existent wie der mit den türkischen Gastarbeitern in der BRD in den 70ern. 

&gt; Diese Prozesse kombiniert mit einer streckenweise katastrophalen Umbruchszeit in den 90er Jahren ergibt eine gute Basis für Rassismus heute...

Eine Neonazi-Szene in der DDR gab es schon vor '89. Wenn du frustriert und jung bist und gegen irgendwas rebellieren willst, dann wirst du halt Nazi. Wenn Antifaschismus Staatsdoktrin ist, dann ist der Hitler eben cool.... http://www.zeit.de/2012/08/DDR-Nazis/komplettansicht 


Als jemand der in Brandenburg geboren wurde und die Nachwende-Zeit mitsamt Neonazis erlebt hat (nicht so intensiv wie andere die in den 90ern älter waren): 

Das Problem ist real, existiert heute noch und ist nicht auf Ostdeutschland beschränkt. 

Wirtschaftliche Perspektivlosigkeit, keine Möglichkeit andere Kulturen kennenzulernen...und massiver Wegzug aus ländlichen Regionen ist aber im Osten Alltag. Die größeren Städte sind (danke Antifa an dieser Stelle!) in Ordnung und lebenswert.. aber die ländlichen Regionen gehen teilweise wirklich durch harte Zeiten... 

Was noch fehlt ist die Kriminalität und die ist durchaus existent und durchaus osteuropäischen Banden zuzuschreiben. Das zu leugnen ist eben auch albern... das zu überspitzen und auf absurde Zustände zu überspitzen ist auch falsch, aber auch der Mangel an Polizei spielt hier eine Rolle.

Learning how to set up and structure an argument.  Learning to understand why other people might have the opinion that they do, even if it's not necessarily the one that you agree with.  Rather than being flexible and trying to understand other perspectives, most German students just shut down mentally.

&gt;You should talk to a lawyer, pretty sure that's illegal and they should reimburse you.

We did.  It's not illegal.

&gt;Well.. guns and school shootings are less prevalent in Germany than in the US and all such protocols would accomplish is the over-profiling of harmless individuals.

So what should the university do if there is a kid who has mental issues and draws violent images on the chalkboard, along with titles like, ""Wir schaffen euch alle""?  The university had no idea what to do with him.  I felt like I was in danger.  Multiple students in the class expressed to me that they felt like they were in danger.  It's not going to be the last time that happens.  Even if there's a weird kid like that only every few years, the university still needs to come up with some way to deal with it.

Those are not actually unwritten. They are the law. StVO.

True, Vorfahrt Rechts is the law.  It was the first thing that came to mind when I was thinking of major rule differences.  While driving, there are a number of laws that are actually broken in every country - it's a matter of knowing which ones that can be difficult.  There are a number of unspoken rules everywhere too (example: in English-speaking countries, if you have to blow your nose, the most polite thing to do is excuse yourself).  One example of a law that is broken all the time outside of Germany but is never really enforced: A lot of cars don't give pedestrians right-of-way in crosswalks.  Even Austrians aren't as good about stopping as Germans are.  Also, in the US, in some parts of the country, the police will pull drivers over for going 1-2 mph above the speed limit (cough, Illinois).

This 'debate' taught me nothing except that men can apparently still have a pissing contest with or without a foreskin.

Neither side has made any concession to any point of the other, and the other commenters here appear to be contributing just as unhelpfully. What no one here seems to acknowledge is that there are valid points on both sides of the argument. The issues are far more complex than anyone seems willing to admit. I'm disappointed with Reddit for reducing this complexity down to pulp-diction... 


That still doesnt answer the argument  what are the reasons to ban it?

I agree some have raised ethical objections to parents making decisions about elective surgery on behalf of an infant, particularly when it is done primarily to protect against risks of HIV and STDs that do not occur until young adulthood. 

[But other ethicists have found it an appropriate parental proxy decision]
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12859815).


Also  I know most critics say we shouldn't be removing healthy body parts from infants, calling circumcision a trauma that can lead to decreased sexual function later in life. 


But the problems is that unlike other forms  child abuse , no psychological association around the world didnt find any meaningful trace of trauma on children life and studies show that is likely not a factor that would affect the child.

http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/¸

[Jewish cildren are more likely to be  psychologically healthy than European children]

(http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207597108246686#.VEwzP_mG-So). 



Also for the OP stats complication do not mean deaths...

A study of 136,000 boys born in US  hospitals between 1980 and 2005. 100,000 were circumcised and 193 (0.19%) had complications, mostly minor, with no deaths, but of the 36,000 who were not circumcised the problems were more than ten-times higher and there were 2 deaths.

www.[Wiswell &amp; Hachey, 1993].com



Lets not forget also that this issue before being an health issue  is a cultural one. Only 20% of european a circumsised but in North Amercia(Canada and USA) its more than 50%. The fact that one culture do not understand  what the other do may lead to some *imbroglios*. The principals reasons to keep it and America and Middle East  are cultural one.

 But the same thing could be said for Europe. Lets be honest the principals reasons to ban it in Europe are also cultural reasons and ethical reasons that are not base on logical studies. but the problem is that ethics could be  easily challenge as shown earlier.

To be honest the argument in Europe is a classic [Think of the children] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children) or an appeal to emotion(Wich is a logical fallacy)


Here:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12859815


Most people that think circumcision cause them a lack of self-esteem or a trauma tought that circumsision was responsilbe for for their lack of sexual performance(Wich is false since studies have show  this is not links with circumcision)

And some more.

 there is a middle ground between the ban of Europe and the the *American laissez-faire* its the Canadian one

 it's called *Brit Shalom*. It's a peaceful baby naming ceremony that more and more informed Jews are choosing, and it doesn't involve cutting off the most sensitive parts of the male penis and is an ideal middle ground. 

The World Jewish Congress and medical association around the world think its a clearly middle ground.

I understand the knee-jerk instinct to cry anti-Semitism, but I urge my fellow Jews to pause and question this ritual as rigorously as we question everything else. It's actually not that crazy to compare male circumcision to procedures in the umbrella term ""female genital cutting"", some of which are extremely more severe (infibulation), some of which are equally severe (a hoodectomy), and some of which have minimal severity (a pinprick to the clitoral hood). 

Framing the dialogue in terms of sex rather than by severity of the specific procedure is counterproductive. Furthermore, it should be recognized that labeling a genital cutting procedure as ""mutilation"" confers pejorative judgement of some outside culture's ritual, but all cutting cultures, whether it's the United States,Canada, Judaism, or muslims, refer to their own genital cutting procedures with the euphemism ""circumcision"", which confers positive judgement.

Before we can have a debate about the limitations of religious freedom, we must first be fully educated about medical ethics, sexual anatomy, and sexual health, for starters. To say that circumcision is harmless with health benefits is a naive uninformed perspective. That's okay - none of us are born experts on the topic, and we all have to learn about it at some point.

This can be done without debates

&gt;Learning to understand why other people might have the opinion that they do, even if it's not necessarily the one that you agree with. Rather than being flexible and trying to understand other perspectives, most German students just shut down mentally.

I don't know where you are or what you are teaching them but I have had long conversations with students from many disciplines and the only people this is true for are law students. Almost everyone who has studied at university or is studying at university is willing to talk and get to the bottom of where the difference in opinion actually starts. Something I find much more important than being able to rattle of arguments for something you don't believe.

I think the difference is in culture. Germans are direct, Germans are honest about what they think and so for us it's not something we are comfortable with because it feels like lying about your beliefs. Americans on the other hand are experts at not telling you what they really think and they implcitly lie on a daily basis so of course they don't have a problem with pretending.

&gt;Even if there's a weird kid like that only every few years, the university still needs to come up with some way to deal with it.

false,thedaysaredark,null,null,"A somewhat long post here, but this is something I've actually thought about from time to time because I think it's an unusual case of Russia actually wanting to be friends with someone in the West. And then I've thought about it from a Finnish and Swedish perspective, too.

I think the general consensus is that we've always either been netural or friends, and that some of the disagreements between us have been a result of us (Norway) having being influenced into taking a standpoint we wouldn't have taken on our own initiative. We are by nature very wary of getting into conflicts in Norway, and would much rather solve them than anything else. So taking sides by sactioning Russia is something I don't think we would have done if it wasn't for almost everyone else already doing it. You could call that being a coward, but I think it's the best way to build bridges and relations between Russia and the West. And I think Jens Stoltenberg, our PM from 2005 to 2013 understood that as well, resulting in some of the best relations between Russia and a Western country. Though it should be said that there's plenty of individuals here, like in every other country, who would like to see Russia being punished for their recent expansion plans. I just don't think that a majority of us see most forms of punishment as something that would help solve the situation for anyone.

Anyway. As an average citizen that just reads too many newspapers, I get the feeling that there's someone with real influence in Kremlin who wants our relations to stay positive. Even with Stoltenberg becoming NATO's general secretary during the Ukraine conflict and our new government being seemingly slightly less pro-Russian, we just don't seem to ever become 'bullied' or picked at by them like so many other similar countries do in the Nordic and Eastern region. Even when some Norwegian officials have strongly criticized Russia for human rights issues throughout the 21st century, they just seem to look past our differences time and time again.

The motivation behind all this might be purely financial, of course, but I get the feeling that it's a little less complex. I simply think Russian politicians decide who they like and dislike based on other criterias than Western Politicians, and this is key to building relations with them. Because whenever I've read news articles about someone in Kremlin and their views on Norway are brought up, it's usually our history and culture that they emphasize, and not our contemporary politics and disagreements: Things like Vikings and how they once visited a Viking mass grave that they found fascinating, or how they like to go fishing here. Lately, the Norwegian press has been writing some articles on how our former FM 'Jonas Gahr Støre' came on such good terms with the Russian FM, and the common thread seems to be managing to establish a personal relationship. That Gahr Støre went to a football game with their foreign minister where they shared some vodka and some laughts, and suddenly both parties were more able to overlook their differences because they had established some common ground. Or how former PM Jens Stoltenberg established good relations with Vladimir Puin by focusing on their shared interests in hunting and fishing.    In other words, I think that by focusing much more on finding some common ground between for example the Finnish PM and Vladimir Putin like Jens Stoltenberg did, Finland could finally have a solid basis for further dialogue. Plus, both parties would likely be so much more willing to listen and to negotiate reasonably.

I might be going on and on here without explaining myself well enough, but I've just had this feeling for a long time now - this real conviction - that there's no need for any countries in the Nordic region to be on bad terms with Russia like I feel most of you are. That there is plenty of common ground to be found with them, and that even though it sounds bizarre, just going on something like a hunting trip with Putin might be a much more effective way of becoming liked by Russia than any other. Because deep down, these Russians actually really like both Norway and Finland and all the rest of us in the Nordics. And they would often rather compare themselves to us than to most other Western European countries who they feel they have less in common with.

For example, take a look at this article: http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-15/putin-intimidation-tactics-kill-entente-hope-for-finnish-pm
Reading it I just couldn't help but shake my head at how sad it all was, because stabilizing the tension with Russia and establishing better relations with them without ever having to agree with them politically is probably so much more easier than he thinks.

I won't necesserily answer your questions so don't be mad. Most cities in Germany and Austria have their origin in the middle ages. Larger market towns (have the right to hold a market) were given the city rights by their nobles which include the right and must of holding market every day. the right to build a city wall. In german there is the saying ""Stadtluft macht frei"", which means ""city air makes free"" which is because if a Serf managed to get inside the walls of the town he was, if the lord didn't ask for him for a certain time, free. 

Now to buildings. Most of the time the residential were 3 stories high and the usage of floors the following: On the ground was the shop with production area behind the counter. Normally it was a Meister, Gesellen and Lehrlinge working there. A Meister learned his work for years has also made his Meisterstück a very good piece of work from his craft. As a carpenter a table or chair. Only Meister were and are allowed in Germany Austria and Switherland to open a craftmanshop. Gesellen have finished their education as a craftsmen and work with the Meister. After finishing education all Gesellen have to go on a journey and aren't allowed near their home for 60km for 6 year (More or less possible). They then search for a new Meister to teach them new tricks and techniques. A Lehrling is an apprentice and learns the craft for years before he does his Gesellenstück a piece of work of his craft alone to become a Geselle.

The Upper floors were then for the family of the owner of the house, who often owned the shop or such beyond. 

The richest burghers and merchants of the town then built their expensive house at the market place to gloat.

The houses most of the time are built connecting to each other to conserve energy and save fuel. Most house then have a chimney at the side or at the middle of the house over each other.

Most inner medivel cities only survived in the very small ones. Sadly even then a lot were bombed in WW2. They got renovated and revitalised so people would start living in them again.

Nope, being able to argue both sides of an issue is vital when studying foreign languages, too.  Reason 1: In many cultures, when writing an academic paper, you must argue both sides of an issue in the paper.  Reason 2: Sometimes, when taking all of your secondary literature into account, you find that all evidence is pointing towards something that you didn't necessarily see or agree with while dealing with the material the first go round.  Sometimes it's just faster and easier to use a string of argumentation that doesn't match your personal opinion.  A Hausarbeit isn't a dissertation.

1. Walk to the top of the Sacre Coeur. It's a hike but the neighborhood of Montmartre is gorgeous and it's the only place where you can see the true ""old Paris"" that was untouched during Napoleon's prettying-up of the city.
2. At the métro stop Denfert Rochereau, take a walk down Rue Daguerre. It's full of speciality shops like wine and authentic cheese stands.
3. If you like museums, my favorite is the impressionist museum called the Musée d'Orsay. It's full of Monets, Renoirs, Toulouse-Lautrecs and Degas. Plus it was the old train station of Paris before it was converted into a museum so the building itself is also a work of art.
4. Walk around the city center. The third and fourth ""arrondissements"" (or districts) are very popular and hip but I like the fifth because in it you can find my favorite garden in all of Paris, the Jardin de Luxembourg. It's huge and lavish. 
5. Buy some wine and cheese and have a picnic in the Place des Vosges, or in the Jardin de Luxembourg :)

That's all I can think of that's not too touristy. Oh, and if you want to check out the bar scene, tour guides will tell you the area around Bastille is the happening place but there is lots to try in the Oberkampf and the Buttes aux Cailles neighborhoods.

Also, be sure to google or use Trip Advisor for restaurants. There are so many restaurants in Paris it's impossible to tell the bad from the good without someone else's help because, speaking from personal experience, sometimes great-looking restaurants are extremely mediocre and sometimes unassuming tiny restaurants have the best food you've ever tasted. Try to avoid touristy areas when looking for restaurants (they're always more expensive) and just remember that the dining culture in France is extremely (!!!) different than in the U.S. Try to remember that you're entering an entirely different culture when it comes to eating and dining in a restaurant. Don't expect french servers to bend over backwards for you like American servers do. They'll probably be accommodating if you're polite but if you're not, you might have a hard time (I'm not suggesting that you're not polite people though!! Just a heads-up) :)

En lisant le Coran, tu lis la notion de guerre enseignée par Mahomet qui était entre autre un chef de guerre. À l'inverse, la notion de guerre juste est complètement absente du catéchisme de l'Église catholique.

&gt;Et les Croisades furent des guerres saintes/pèlerinages armés non ? 

C'était officiellement des guerres de protection des chrétiens... La première croisade est lancée en 1095 car les Seldjoukides refusaient le passage des pélerins chrétiens. Ça n'a pas empêché les croisés de massacrer toute la population cela dit.

&gt;C'est le pendant Chrétien du djihad (par l'épée)

Rien dans la Bible ne justifie cela, contrairement au Coran.

&gt;si on prends en compte que ""l'auteur"" principal du nouveau testament est Paul de Tarse

Paul ne fait pas partie des 12 et n'est pas vraiment l'auteur principal. Il n'a pas écrit le principal, qui sont les évangiles. Paul, c'est le lobbyiste chrétien auprès de l'empire romain. Il a profondément marqué le christianisme mais pas au point d'en faire l'auteur principal. Le principal, ce sont les Évangiles.

&gt;donc c'est finalement ce que dieu veux dire non ?

Non, je ne comprends pas ton raisonnement. Le Nouveau Testament sont des mots d'humains. Jésus n'est pas Dieu non plus. Tu as quand même l'intermédiaire de Jésus, puis l'intermédiaire des Évangélistes ou de Saint Paul.

Except for a few brief stints in the US, I grew up in a small German village and my (German) grandma taught me DA RULES:

1. Greet everyone you pass on the street. When I moved to a city for college, people were bewildered I would insist on a cheerful ""Guten Tag"". Even now I still catch myself nodding and smiling at strangers and hear my gran saing what a ""braves Mädchen"" I am. 

2. Don't give out too much information. This is more important for kids since they are easy targets for nosy neighbors. It's always fine to talk about work and hobbies, but I think it's better to keep details about dating and finances to yourself, unless talking to people you've befriended. An example: My friend's mother, a 50something divorced woman who moved here from East Germany shortly after the Mauerfall, recently struck up a relationship with a man. Now, I know the details because my friend and I have been as close as sisters since the day we met in kindergarten. But the gossip club don't know I know, so whenever I come home and see them, they fill me in on the latest gossip and (completely fabricated) details about friend's mom's boyfriend. Not malicious, mind you, but annoying.

3. Sweep/shovel your sidewalk. Most rural communities will only have service to clear the street, but the sidewalk is your business and if somebody trips and hurts themselves, it might mean trouble. If you move to an apartment building without janitorial service, clean the hallway/stairs when it's your turn. It's just plain rude not to do it. You're allowed to do anything you please to your property, but don't annoy your neighbors. I always get the feeling Americans are too set on their ~*FREEDOM*~ to really care about inconveniencing others, but maybe Germans are just too anal about it. 

These may sound negative, but honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. Giving someone a few seconds of your time is just respectful and may brighten an absolute shit day. Also, a great way to get to know your new neighbors! Okay, I don't like all the gossip, but these people are mostly housewives with grown kids and retired elderly people with nothing better to do, so I guess there's nothing you can do. Besides, it has its merits. For example, my grandpa lives alone none of us live near him. It's nice to know there are people keeping an eye on him. Lastly, do your part and people will gladly do it for you when you can't. 

Don't worry about making mistakes, just show you're trying your best to fit in.

I (as stated in my post) am currently going through a work transition back into Software Development after being out of it for awhile.  I've been pondering a change of scenery as well in the near future and just thought of the idea of moving to another country as well.  Europe came to mind first, and Germany (with a passing knowledge of while reading the news over the past few years) seemed like an economically stable country.  So while I entertain/think this idea of moving to another country through, Germany seems like a good starting point.
&gt; What do they think of the idea? Truly? How old are your daughters? Bear in mind that if you manage to find a job and your wife and daughters don't, they will be more likely to suffer from culture shock than you.

Wife is on-board with the idea.  Daughters are both less than 2yrs old.

&gt; (houses, cars)I'm struggling to work out why this is relevant. You may be able to ship your cars over to Germany (at great expense and risk), but there's no guarantee they will be legal on German roads.

I figured I'd have to sell the house and cars, as transporting them seems like an unnecessary expense.  I guess I was fishing for responses about experiences handling this from those who moved to Germany from another country (US in particular).
&gt;Never underestimate culture shock. You may be lucky and not suffer with it, but most people do, and a few people actually get depressed. Bear in mind that you would be leaving everything familiar behind you, losing pretty much your entire support network. Communication will also be unexpectedly different: it's not just the spoken language (which you will be expecting), but social etiquette and body language as well -- be prepared to have the uncomfortable feeling that everyone is staring at you all the time (they're not, it just seems like it). Germans generally try to be welcoming, but they may seem to you to be cold, unemotional and even rude (and they might think you to be full of false bonhomie and even conceited).

I know it's easy to say as I've not experienced it yet, but right now the culture shock is something I'd welcome.  Yeah, it'd be change, and there'd be a transitional period where it'd be frustrating/unpleasant, but I'd get used to it.  I think my wife is a bit of the same.

Additionally, you are making it sound like the Soviets were forced to sign the MRP and that somehow they had to give something up when they signed the pact? Are you forgetting all the countries that stalin was able to annex thanks to the pact?

The soviets were indeed considered to be military one of the strongest if not the strongest power in the world prior to WWII.

However, as terrible as it is, there are a few advantages to it. The one off the top of my head is that it disenfranchises anything more than two parties.

Also the first study claims 10% inflation is good for reducing unemployment rate 2 % and gaining less than 1 percent in GDP. That is marginally retarded. Such a high inflation has a massive effect on income, deposits and credit that it would make you a health risk for all foreign credit. The relative benefit from trade which you would get would be limited compared to the bonus you currently get from not paying ANY CUSTOMS or having to work around exchange rates. I get it's important to prove a point , but those guys are really stretching it.

The second guys, again, I assume the table is just a macroeconomic perspective in which he considers the new net difference in export and imports. But unless you close of the borders and become self sustainable internally you do not want inflation and cheap exports, China and even the US will outsell us easaly. We compete with Japan, not india, and it's not a pride thing, it's just common sense, we can not affort their labor costs. This is even more protectionist and cut of from reality. Russia tried to start exporting only by forcing inflation, even germany had a attempt durring the auto crisis in 2006 or 2007. It does not work. Inflation is not a big enough lever to increase expors enough to offset your imports which are much more severly impacted by a weaker currency.

&gt;Switzerland, Norway and the UK do much better thanks to their control.

The UK is fucked, QE basically signed them up for at least 20 years of constant inflationary pressure they can not get rid of.

Norway literally has the money to print money and not feel a sting.

I can't recall why the swiss intervened monetarily but it was a banking issue not a trade issue.

&gt;A 2% inflation rate is simply not adapted to our economic structure.

Why? 

Economic stagnation is a consequence of lack of vision and developement. European leaders have a long tradition of that. The EU is just a easy target for national politicians to point at.

Please explain why does deflation bother you? 

The political issues of the EU are not for me to argue against, we both want to dismantle the EPP and create a real democracy at the european level not a luxembourgian plutocracy powered by national politicians greed.

All of europe has a tradition of submiting to US interests, that is the status quo, I would argue that as a united front we stand a better chance of saying no, than as individual members. I know for certainty that my countrymen are to scared to actually have a opinion or say no.

Again imigration is a national issue that is just passed onto the EU. If you have hard laws nobody will come there to do crimes. Your fight is with local liberals. Going soft on crime encourages it.

Blame feminism for demographic stagnation, women happen to have better things to do than have babies in modern societies. Also considering how mildly retarded the education system is, we're better of with imigrant kids that have at least marginal ambition.

That is just plain stupid, they get money from taxes and are propped up by local goverments that are payed for by taxes. They want your taxes, a lot of them.

 * Pace of life is slower.  People take time to enjoy family, neighbors and friends.  Actually, since everything is closed on Sundays, you have no choice but to spend the whole day relaxing or recreating.

 * Germans have an undeserved reputation for being cold and stodgy.  Get to know them and nothing could be further from the truth!  You are never far from a nearby town festival, and it is always fun to watch the German people letting their hair down.

 * Germany is EXTREMELY hiker and biker (bicycle) friendly.  No matter where you live in rural Germany, there will be hundreds of miles of hiking possibilities just within a 10 km radius.

 * Public transportation choices are abundant.  Between air, rail, bus, and taxi service, you can literally travel from any doorstop to any other doorstop in Germany conveniently without a car.

 * At restaurants, beer is actually cheaper than water!

false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The ""vibe"" of a subreddit changes as it grows to a certain size. Originally, it was a reaction to what we perceived as a point where this subreddit had outgrown the stage where regulars knew each other and discussed even controversial topics with relative maturity and a certain level of mutual respect. At the time, there also was an almost daily anti-Muslim/Roma/immigration thread that seemed [systematic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory), but the mods here have cracked down on this issue since then (which lead to the creation of another, similarly named subreddit, that follows an opposite approach).  
So, the original idea was to have a smaller alternative for those who aimed to keep themselves to some sort of self-regulated style of respectful exchange of views around a politically centrist core, and preferred a more draconian mod style against those who intentionally try to push an agenda. This has since evolved into a subreddit for European themed longform articles and analysis. Slow-food, if you will.

The downside, at least so far, is that there aren't many discussions yet, and taking time to write a well thought-out comment to post into what seems like a bit of a void can be frustrating. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg thing, but the growth is slow but steady and you're welcome to join and participate.

Overall I am satisfied with life here. The quality/cost of life intersection is much better here than in London, where I lived previously, or in New York City, where I am from originally. I came with no German and I am now at B1 level, maybe starting to shade into B2 level, but mostly my life is in English (I work in English, family life is in English, most of our friends here are English-speakers) so I am not really integrated into German life. 

However, if you want to work in English in Berlin then there aren't that many options, either you work in a tech startup (like me) or you work for a big multinational like Rolls-Royce, Siemens, Amazon or Nokia. I've met other English-speakers who have been here for years without learning more than a very tiny amount of German, so it can be done if you want to, but I've found that even progressing to shitty German from no German has made me feel more comfortable here and has helped in many situations. As a doctor I don't think you have any choice but to learn German, and I would guess that you are going to have to get to at least C1 to practice.

The downsides aren't really that huge. In terms of the place itself, things function quite well overall, so I don't have any complaints beyond very minor ones. Be warned that German bureaucracy is very convoluted, so when you first move here you have to learn to navigate that labyrinth. 

I guess the biggest challenge is just the loneliness when you move here - you don't know the language or the customs, and Germans, while generally pleasant, are not the world's warmest people.

You don't have a dozen or half-dozen children to look after, and you didn't grow up this way yourself. What we perceive to be the norm affects what we think of as bearable. There's also only so much space within the city walls.

As for country houses, the style varies depending on how the local society works. For example, far East the [junkers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junker) owned large swaths of land with [knechts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knecht) to work the land. But in the Black Forest, the typical setup would be a large multi-generational (plus cows and storage) [house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest_house) for the family that owns the farm along with a section of a forest. It was quite functional, e.g., smoke from the fire to cook in and heat the kitchen was used to smoke ham hanging under the roof for preservation.

I think you hit on a very interesting point.

Not because I'm not capable of understanding their side or their arguments, or I'm not creative enough, but because I'm forced to get emotionally involved against my will. 

Maybe the ""peach and coconut"" comparison applies: Possibly it's easier for Americans to pretend to be on someone else's side just for the sake of appearance (soft outside) while on the inside they don't care (hard inside), while Germans won't do it if they don't agree (hard outside), but when they do, they really care (soft inside).

You may have more success with German pupils if you take away the emotional involvement, i.e. don't split the class, and ask everyone to come up with points in favor and against for each of the sides.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128378/

&gt;In 1648 a Cossack rebellion in the Ukraine threatens the sovereignty of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth over the Cossack nation. The Cossack rebellion also known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising is pitting the Cossack nation and its Crimean Tatar allies against the forces sent by the Polish king John II Casimir. Polish Colonel Michal Wolodyjowski is leading a squadron of Polish cavalry.Traitors,assassins and spies are everywhere. Against the backdrop of the uprising, a Polish knight Skrzetuski and a Cossack leader Bohun fall in love with the same young beautiful woman, Helena. Their rivalry becomes the symbol of Polish-Ukrainian struggle. 

There's also 1810 one

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170351/

&gt;In the early 1810s, Poles, part of Russia's client state of Lithuania, think independence will come if they join forces with Napoleon when he invades Russia. This unity of purpose, in one district, is undermined by two families, feuding since the head of one shot the head of the other twenty years before. There are hopes of a reconciliation through a marriage of Pan Tadeusz, a Soplica, whose father, the murderer, is in hiding somewhere, and Zosia, a teen-aged girl, a Horeszko who lives in the household of Pan's uncle. Other cross-currents - of love, family, politics, village traditions, land reform, and what it means to be Polish - give the film texture.

false,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt;  I've been pondering a change of scenery

So the question is whether a mere ""change of scenery"" is worth the risk.

&gt; Germany seemed like an economically stable country.

So far, it's weathered the economic crisis relatively well, but there are signs that the economy may be starting to wobble. That said, Germany does still have a solid manufacturing base, so of all the countries in Europe, it is probably one of the least likely to get into real trouble.

&gt; the culture shock is something I'd welcome

Culture shock is basically a feeling of isolation when communication breaks down; added to that, things don't work the way you expect them to work. I never had any real problem with culture shock myself, but I know people who arrived in Germany full of anticipation and ready to start an exciting new life and adventure, and six months later they couldn't bear it any more.

I'm not asking you to convince me you won't suffer from culture shock; I'm suggesting you take into account the very real possibility that it may be more than merely frustrating or unpleasant.

A classic case of culture shock (not everyone experiences it in the same way) progresses something like this:

1. The honeymoon period: everything is an exciting adventure.
2. A few weeks later, you encounter some problems... and then more. Life becomes frustrating.
3. Crisis: The problems you face start to overwhelm you. You have no support network and the language barrier frustrates your efforts to get things sorted out. Homesickness and, in severe cases, depression may set in. Even making friends with people from your native country helps less than you expected, because they're already assimilated and are almost as much German as they are American.
4. Adjustment: You develop strategies to cope with all the problems and frustrations. You start to get to grips with how things work, how to deal with bureaucracy, how to behave at parties. Your language skills improve. You may even find new comfort foods to replace the ones you can't easily get.
5. You start to enjoy life. Once again, all the differences between your native culture and your host culture excite, rather than frustrate, you. But you accidentally cause offence, because when you try to talk about it to the natives, they think you're insulting their country. And the people back home just don't understand what you're talking about. Once again, communication breaks down, but for different reasons and with different results.
6. Finally, one of three things can happen: (a) you completely reject your host country and can't wait to get back home; (b) you become so assimilated into your host culture that you actually reject your native culture -- so if you ever do have to move back for any reason you have to go through the whole process again (reverse culture shock); (c) you manage to find the right balance and can enjoy the best of both worlds.

Yes, you can get used to it, and probably will; but the process can be very dispiriting, if you're unlucky. I don't know where you are in the States exactly, but Germany is roughly on the same latitude as the Dakotas -- at midwinter, it gets dark at around 4pm, and stays dark until around 8am -- that doesn't help if you're from Florida and feeling homesick. It will be a disaster if you desparately want to stay in Germany and your wife desparately wants to leave (or vice versa).

Basically, don't just assume that you'll simply ""get used to it"". You can certainly hope for an easy transition, and that's very possible; but do be prepared for a rough ride, and do have an exit strategy if, six months down the line, things don't work out for you.",0,1414316852,null,0,false,0,clk2ply,t3_2k9h3b,t1_clk2ply,t1_cljxbtz,null,1426345577,8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,8

&gt;In 1992, during Cavaco Silva government, by Decree-Law 124/92, mainland Portugal officially changed its time zone from WET (UTC+00:00) to CET (UTC+01:00).[2][10] CEST (UTC+02:00) began to be observed as DST, from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in September.[2][10] The measure, approved without the consultation of Lisbon Observatory, had the intention of to promote energy savings, to make that “Portugal follow, in work schedules, the countries with which it maintains more frequent contacts” (DL 124/92) and so, to promote economic growth.[10] However, the measure quickly proved to be a failure in to achieve its objectives and become unpopular: like in the 1967–1976 period, on winter mornings, sun was still rising at 9:00, and people went to their works with a completely dark sky.[11][12] Obviously, children also went to school with a completely dark sky, and when school classes started, sun was still rising, which had repercussions on their standards of learning, school performance and sleeping habits.[12][13][14] It was even common that children fall asleep on the early morning classes.[11][14] In summer evenings, the usage of CET and CEST revealed to have a disturbing effect on people’s sleeping habits, particularly on children's ones as sun was still setting at 22:00 or 22:30, therefore sky was only completely dark near midnight, and sometimes, only at 1:00 of the following day.[11][13][14] A company hired by European Commission conducted a study which concluded that, in fact, no energy savings happened, because in the early morning, due to the dark sky, workers turn on lights in their offices, and forgot to turn them off, leaving them switched on during the rest of the morning, what incremented energy consumption.[12][14] It also emerged concerns about the effect that the coincidence of rush hours with the hottest hours of the day could have in air pollution.[12][15] Furthermore, it was observed an increase in the number of assaults on children in the morning, and insurance companies reported a rise in the number of accidents. [11][16] Due to all of these concerns and complaints, it became clear that situation could not continue much longer without a new analysis

* Controversy continues around the introduction of water charges with [thousands of people out on the streets of Limerick during the week.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/more-than-6-000-people-protest-against-water-charges-in-limerick-1.1977301) Adding to the anger are reports of the bonuses available at the new semi-State body in charge of running it (Irish Water), including a [€9,000 bonus for staff ""in need of improvement.""](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/irish-water-to-pay-9000-bonus-to-staff-in-need-of-improvement-30676922.html) Another point of controversy is that people are currently being charged for water before they have a water meter installed in their house. There's speculation that the head of the semi-state body [might be sacked over his handling of the set-up of the organisation.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/john-tierney-needs-to-be-front-and-centre-for-irish-water-1.1975978) 
* Sinn Féin (the political wing of the PIRA) has been in the spotlight all week over revelations of how the PIRA handled allegations of [sexual abuse and other crimes.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/kneecapping-yes-but-a-victim-s-wellbeing-wasn-t-an-ira-priority-1.1975897?page=2) This is notable as Sinn Féin has been doing very well in the polls up until now. A woman named Mairia Cahill came forward saying that she was raped by a senior PIRA member in 1998 and then forced to meet with him in a IRA ""kangaroo court."" Over the week other women came forward as well and allegations have been made this week that the PIRA moved sexual offenders to Dublin (and elsewhere) to avoid damaging their movement.

Last week it came to light that the USA have banned six individuals from visiting her soil. There was an article about this in a pro-Fidesz newspaper which tried to twist the story. It backfired however, because before that nobody knew about the bannings. Now there is a [huge scandal](http://www.euronews.com/2014/10/22/hungary-confronts-obama-administration-over-travel-bans/), because the six individuals are suspected to be goverment officals, one being the head of the Tax Office.

So generating the same amount of electrical energy from CHP plants would save a huge amount of gas used to generate heat today? The same if electricity is used for heat as the saved energy could reduce the total need for electric energy and thus make it possible to reduce the usage of gas that way.

Oh come on, you know that's a strawman :) They didn't ask to be called Norwegians. 

&gt; My problem with not-accepting Elladitis is the implication that in order to be Greek you must come from Greece, whereas a Cypriot can consider themselves Greek as well and hence, there is a need for a distinction.

That's not the case most of the time. The correction usually comes in the form of ""I'm an Ellinas and you are too. Don't call me Elladitis"". Now, it happens that I don't even identify with any nation so my use of Elladitis is not motivated from the ""Greeks exist outside Greece too"" argument that Greek Cypriots mostly use.

So, to cut this short, I'd say that the most appropriate position is to call Greeks from Greece what they want to be called (they appears to overwhelmingly favour Ellinas) and be mindful of the minefield of ethnic identities that Cyprus has (some of us see ourselves as Greeks of Cyprus (Ellines tis Kyprou), others as Greek Cypriots (Ellinokyprioi), yet others as just Cypriots or even less connected to the idea of nations, as just citizens of Cyprus).

- BEst museums : Le Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, Centre George Pompidou, Les Invalides (where Napoléon is burried) &amp; Grand Palais exhibitions 

- Shopping: Haussman district with the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps etc... 

- picnic in Champ de Mars at sunset to watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle

- Best parks: Jardin du Luxembourg, Les Tuileries, Butte-Chaumont, Jardin des Plantes ( there are a zoo &amp; impressive greenhouses)

- a walk in Chatelet-les Hall, Sentier, Etienne Marcel, Arts et Métiers: perfect place to have a drink (rue Montorgueil) and visit Beaubourg. Very popular and trendy neighborhood

​Russia turns its clock to winter time, permanently
Russia has turned back its clocks to winter time and has reverted to the full 11 zones from Kamchatka in the Pacific to Kaliningrad that were reduced to nine by the previous president, Dmitry Medvedev. In July, Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a law bringing back winter time but canceled the summer time shift.

- In Thuringia, coalition negotiations are about to begin between the Lefts, the Social Democrats, and the Greens (red-red-green).¹ The interesting thing about this is that it’s the first time The Left will set the prime minister of a federal state. There’s also been some discussion about the relation between The Left and the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the GDR party), and apparently they initially refused calling the GDR an “unjust state” (Unrechtsstaat, opposite of Rechtsstaat “constitutional state”). I don’t know too much about that though – fellow Germans, feel free to correct me!

  - 2014-10-26 13:00 CEST EDIT: Some more info: At the moment, the only coalition feasible on federal level is the current Grand Coalition. In last year’s federal election, red-red-green would also have had a majority (in current polls the AfD prevents that), but this possibility was rejected mainly by the SPD, arguing that The Left was too unstable and fragmented to be a reliable coalition partner. So the fact that a red-red-green coalition is now considered in one state also influences federal politics.

- Angela Merkel bitch-slapped David Cameron twice:
  - On the adjustments / extra payments: Cameron – “I won’t pay that”; Merkel – “yes you will”

      &gt; This did not come out of the blue. I understand that it’s difficult to come up with €2 billion, David, but this should have been expected ([source](http://rt.com/uk/199296-uk-europe-bill-demand/))  
      &gt; These are normal adjustment procedures, which […] this year […] for some countries turned out to be exceptionally high. […] We do not doubt the correctness of these results. The cause for these peaks must be explained […] but then the finance ministers must consider how to solve this […]. ([source](http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Mitschrift/Pressekonferenzen/2014/10/2014-10-24-statement-merkel-bruessel.html), translation by myself)
  
  - on migration reform: Cameron apparently wanted to “cap the number of low-skilled migrants seeking work in the United Kingdom”, Merkel:

      &gt; Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU ([source](http://www.dw.de/merkel-deals-blow-to-britains-cameron-on-migration-reform/a-18021585))

- 2014-10-27 18:00 EDIT: There was some discussion about the federal system, and if we really need all 16 states: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (Christian Democrats, apparently considered Merkel’s “crown princess”) suggested that perhaps it could be reduced to 6-8 states. Most other politicians didn’t like that, especially Horst Seehofer (Christian Socials – the CSU is basically the Bavarian CDU). Unfortunately I don’t have a good English link for that; there’s [this editorial](http://www.dw.de/opinion-german-federalism-can-also-take-a-different-form/a-18021494), and then German articles about [the suggestion](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-sechs-oder-acht-bundeslaender-a-998987.html) and (two days later) [the rebukes](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/laenderfusionen-seehofer-weist-drohung-aus-dem-saarland-zurueck-a-999249.html).

Poi c'era il Tipo, non ho mai saputo il suo nome vero. Era la macchietta del villaggio per antonomasia, ha avuto la palma incontrastata per parecchi decenni.

(in friulano-sangiorgiono, trad: ""cosa hai detto? due J&amp;B?""). La sua fama lo precedeva, tipicamente arrivava al bar un amico in bicicletta ""sta arrivando il Tipo!"" e tutti l'aspettavamo. Quando arrivava, come una rockstar, gli chiedevamo di farci qualche sua scenetta, e la sua specialità erano i ""Paciocchini"". Giuro che non ho memoria di cosa fosse, la scenetta, ma ricordo bene che era il suo cavallo di battaglia. Negli anni 90, qualche anno prima che morisse, gli avevano addirittura dato la conduzione di un programma televisivo su una tv regionalissima (Canale 55, di cui non trovo traccia online).

First of all, I agree with everything you've said here except supporting autonomy. The Belgrade being overbearing is bad, but that's not that uncommon for European countries (look at Paris, Rome, London etc.) and the solution is decentralisation, not autonomy, especially not with the Serbian Balkanization-prone mentality. The big reason Serbia's economy is bad is the huge public sector as a relic of communist time, giving more autonomy and complicating administration is far from being a solution. Even now, you have loads of money being spent on city, special region and national politicians with many institutions being doubled (national and regional protecter of citizens), just so that a region with little over 1 million people (out of 7 million) would have an autonomy even though it's not doing much better than the rest of the country without autonomy. 
 
Besides that, some nations (Serbs, Chinese, Japanese, French) just don't take federalization well and are most united when under one political power, as much as I'm for financial decentralization I'm afraid that autonomy of regions in a country that already has sort of lost it's sense of identity thanks to radical changes (Kingdom of Serbia, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, first Yugoslavia, Second Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro etc.) in the past will just divide the people even further and destibilize it.

You definitely couldn't say we had always been ""neutral or friends""


It's not like Finland's looking forward to getting into conflicts here. We have so much border with Russia that in a conflict between the west and russia we're among the ones that suffer the most. But this proximity to Russia also makes Russian's expansion plans (in actual landmass or ""sphere of influence"") a bigger threat to us than to most other western countries. I don't know if the current sanctions will help the situation or just make it worse, but do you have any better ideas? :/


The fact that Norway doesn't get picked at is something I've also realized and am kind of jealous of. You managed to be the only NATO country sharing a border with Russia during the whole cold war, respect to you for that. For us, even talking about membership results in [threats](http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2014/10/21/om-finland-gar-med-i-nato-blir-ni-var-fiende). I don't know if it's because our border with Russia is longer or because for some shitty historical reason they think they should have more control over us or whatnot, but I don't like it at all.


Anyways,  I see where you're coming from but to me it sounds very much like the policy we had towards the soviet union for decades, aka [Finlandization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization).  Which is something I'd rather not see again.

Multiple ways I'd assume, but the last time such a law was enforced here in Cyprus was ""arrested during intercourse"". To be fair, that case was a clusterfuck. For one, it was politically motivated (Greek Cypriot politician arrested by Turkish Cypriot Police), and for another, the politician was making use of sex services offered by an immigrant 17 year old prostitute working in an area known for human trafficking, which casts shadows on whether the intercourse has a consensual transaction or forced prostitution (and I'm inclined to think that it indeed wasn't consensual and that if the Turkish Cypriot Police had a law back then that differentiated between having consensual sex with a man, and having sex with a trafficked person, the politician should had been prosecuted. But back then, the charge was plainly ""improper carnal knowledge of a male"" aka ""sodomy""). 

So that's one way, and I think it's probably the only way ever used in Cyprus until few years ago when 'sodomy' was decriminalised. (There was a Russian style ""gay propaganda"" law for the period between 1998-2002 but it wasn't used, nor there was a need to use it because no activism was taking place).

That is correct. Here's evidence from [/r/Intactivists/wiki:timeline](/r/Intactivists/wiki/index#wiki_medicalized_foreskin_destruction):

&gt;[Circumcision] does not necessitate handling of the penis by the child himself and therefore does not focus the male's attention on his own genitals. Masturbation is considered less likely.

Alan F. Guttmacher, Should the Baby Be Circumcised?, *Parents Magazine*, vol. 16 (1941): pp. 26, 76-78.

&gt;The prepuce is one of the great factors in causing masturbation in boys. Here is the dilemma we are in: If we do not teach the growing boy to pull the prepuce back and cleanse the glans there is the danger of smegma collecting and of adhesions and ulcerations forming, which in their turn will cause irritation likely to lead to masturbation. If we do teach the boy to pull the prepuce back and cleanse his glans, that handling alone is sufficient gradually and almost without the boy's knowledge to initiate him into the habit of masturbation ... Therefore, off with the prepuce!

William J. Robinson, Circumcision and Masturbation, Medical World, vol. 33 (1915): p. 390.

Speaking of smegma, men think circumcision makes them incapable of accumulating anything like that, but that's not true unless the surgery was done so ""tightly"" (destructively) that it's what the pro-surgery crew on reddit considers ""botched"" by virtue of excess tissue destruction. [[/r/Intactivists/wiki: explanation of differences between foreskin destruction surgeries](/r/Intactivists/wiki/index#wiki_categorizing_variations_of_foreskin_destruction)]

The recent claim that normal-tight cuts can be considered botched is just the pro-surgery/anti-foreskin movement's attempt at damage control. It is not what they really believe (at least not the sadist-pervert ringleaders of ""medical"" anti-foreskin activism like [Vernon Quaintance](http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Vernon_Quaintance), [Jake Waskett](http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Jake_H._Waskett), and [Brian Morris](http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Brian_J._Morris)). Then, if you look at the medical literature (authored by anti-foreskin activists), you'll see that the pro-surgery/anti-foreskin movement has never considered excessive destruction of the skin of the penis to be a drawback. In fact, on their websites and in their comments they leave all over the internet, you can see that the anti-foreskin movement has always promoted the maximum destruction of tissue as ideal.

This movement is ridiculously deceptive. They approach the promotion of involuntary non-therapeutic foreskin destruction surgery like they're engaging in wartime psychological warfare necessary to save their homeland. In a sense, they are. The cultural blemish that is the anti-foreskin/involuntary non-therapeutic foreskin destruction movement is an inevitable part of the fundamental cultural problem of allowing involuntary non-therapeutic cultural mutilations to be performed on children (for whatever reason some surgery-loving perverts on the internet can imagine).",0,1414327676,null,0,1414327856,0,clk4kg1,t3_2k7323,t1_clk4kg1,t1_cliyl42,null,1426344709,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You put too much emphasis on a random piece of paper and completely ignore what they represent and what the *mood* was at the time.


The reason i brought Spanish civil war was again to show the readiness of the so called ""Allies"" (in form of Soviets and Nazi's) to fight with each other and fund the other side. By your logic, Soviet Union was an Ally of United States during Vietnam War, because Soviets financed and gave equipment to North, United States was on South side? Do you see how silly the argument is? 


I am saying that Soviet leadership was **forced** to sign MRP, **because of all the shit previously combined in one huge menacing picture** for the existence of it. Soviet Union was alone in the world, surrounded by ""Fascist friends"" with quite a peculiar ideology and views on Slavs. 


The countries that were annexed was as you said earlier **a buffer** or a collateral, something that made perfect sense at the time if you were to get off your mighty moral horse and look at the global disposition of forces at the time. Make it so, that Soviets did not occupied those regions, how many days would Baltics and Eastern Europe last against Nazi Military machine? How many months did France last, a military powerhouse at the time? Netherlands? Denmark? Norway? 


France was also considered a continental powerhouse at the time, together with Britain, how much did they last and what would have happened to UK if la Manche was not there? And that was a 1 front war, without Japan possibility of joining in on the fun.


When people talk about how strong Soviets were, i ask them, why with all the military might **in 1941** within a summer campaign Nazi's were that close to Moscow? What if war started in 1939 then, when Soviets did not had those T-34s and production base being built everywhere in *extreme rush*. 


Never did i said that USSR was benevolent or invaded Poland out of goodness of its heart, (to protect minorities if it rocks your boat) this was a typical bullshit excuse used by many, many countries before to achieve their strategic goals and give some form of *legitimacy* to their claims (at least in eyes of domestic population). People generally don't like wars and dieing, but if you brainwash them or say that you ""protect your countrymates abroad"" you might have a different ""more understanding"" population. 


Poland and Baltics were a buffer to move the border several hundred kilometers from Soviet Union, geopolitically it made perfect fucking sense in the same way how Soviets wanted to move the border with Finland in regards to St.Petersbourg. There are no morals or feels in global politics, just cold blooded calculation and what was the best for your country. Baltics and Poles in that regard were victims of circumstances, surrounded by *far stronger* entities at the time. 


By Eastern Europeans i mean the likes of Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and others, hence i gave you a list of Fascist countries in Europe. Romania was doomed to join because oil that was 99.9%, Hungary = Trianon + plenty of other reasons in regards to say Ukraine, Slovaks had their reasons as well. Look at Alliances and global situation at the time, Soviets had **zero** friends in the world.


I don't know if we need to agree with each other necessarily, all i was advocating about that there were plenty of reasons to sign MRP and delay the war in Soviet leadership mind. Understand a simple thing - **no one gives a shit about morals, human rights or someones territorial integrity in face of looming war**.

Let's take Gulags vs Concentration Camps, you conflate the two as if they're simply the same thing.

Gulags were for political dissidents and were not intended to kill people straight up, they were labour camps and the majority of people who went there survived to tell the tale. Given, a lot of people went there so Stalin's NKVD still managed to rack up a lot of deaths, with its worst period being at the height of the German invasion, understandably(Who cares about labour camp prisoners when there's a war being lost and the state about to collapse? That would have been the thinking). 

Contrast with Concentration Camps, which contained everybody from political dissidents, to alcoholics, to gays, to homeless people, and ultimately to people of ""inferior race"" such as Romani and Jews and they were mostly intended for the extermination of these groups, either through forcing them to work to death or through outright mass murder. 

While both are horrible things and totally immoral, the conditions that brought them about, and the intent when sentencing people to these two styles of camps, were different and they should be viewed with a different approach, not with the view that they are simply the same thing in two different places. 

Similarly with the Holodomor, which is viewed as a genocide by 25 countries. Was it a crime against humanity? Absolutely.

What makes the Holodomor different to the Bengal Famines under the British Raja for example? The Holodomor killed more people, and both of these famines were exacerbated by administrative incompetence and negligence, and the Holodomor even more so as there was an active insurgency against Stalin's failed forced-collectivization policy, and they burned all the crops and massacred the livestock, which many argue caused the famine in the first place. And the Bengal famine was exacerbate by the fact that there was a war(Though Commissions investigating it say there was enough to go around, it was just withheld from the affected populations).

Would we then say that as the Holodomor killed more, that the Soviets were more evil than the British? Some would disagree for a variety of different reasons(Various genocides by British Empire etc.), but in this case we would again have to analyse the material, social and political conditions and come to a conclusion based on that.

No matter what you throw out there, be it ""yellow is a great color"" or ""vanilla ice cream is delicious"" or ""the pros and cons of the death penalty,"" German students have the tendency to shut down when they even have to think about justifying an opinion other than their own.  This can screw them over big time if they have to work in an international context later on.

In France, if you do not write both sides of an argument in a paper (example: yellow is good and yellow is bad), then you've only written half a paper.  In the UK, it is still common to ask students to write papers exploring both sides of an issue.  That's something falling out of favor in the US at the university level, but something that is still done from time to time.

I taught in Hungary for one of those years that I was away, and Hungarian students had no problems arguing both sides of an issue.  I've also been an Erasmus lecturer in the UK and am currently working with a writing center in Sweden.  So far, it's only been the Germans dig their heels in and say, ""Nope, I don't believe that, so I can't even pretend to argue that at all.""

We expect our students to produce culture-appropriate work (so, students in French classes are supposed to produce papers structured the same way they would be in France).  Even after presenting these ideas of cultural norms, the only thing that really works is making the Erstis write practice papers, and then ripping the papers' argumentation and structure to shreds.

&gt; **Clean bill of health for Greek banks from stress tests**

&gt; Greek banks received what amounts to a virtually clean bill of health from the European Central Bank, as the results of the stress tests Frankfurt performed on the four systemic lenders of this country showed on Sunday that Alpha and Piraeus have completed the exercise successfully through their dynamic picture, and only Eurobank and National need to cover the negligible amount of 291 million euros in total.

&gt; ""Eurobank has practically no shortfall and National Bank of Greece has no shortfall,"" read the ECB statement on Sunday afternoon.

&gt; The results are not only a major boost for the local credit sector, but also for the government as they allow it to handle the reserves of about 11.3 billion euros at the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund for alternative purposes, such as the reduction of the national debt.

&gt; Piraeus Bank showed capital needs of 660 million euros according to the data up to December 31, 2013, but the restructuring plan that the bank has submitted and partly implemented already cover all of its needs, according to Reuters.

&gt; National Bank announced that its capital needs based on its static picture (end-2013 data) amounted to 3.43 billion euros, but its plan on restructuring its assets and operations has diminished its requirements to just 273.28 million euros. This will likely be covered by the sale of shares in Finansbank, National's Turkish subsidiary.

&gt; Eurobank announced that its original deficit, calculated using the end-December 2013 picture, came to 4.63 billion euros, but following its share capital increase of 2.86 billion euros and the restructuring plan submitted, its requirements amount to no more than 17.55 million euros.

&gt; Alpha has not only passed the stress test with its Core Tier 1 index at 8.1, but it has also found itself among the top 20 percent of the 123 banks across Europe that took part in the exercise of the ECB.",0,1414330663,null,0,false,0,clk5bw2,t3_2kd2vx,t1_clk5bw2,t3_2kd2vx,null,1426344355,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Courses may be cancelled if not enough people are interested, and in that case you don't pay anything.

false,justfroze,EURO,(french)European Union,"&gt; There's no free market for Internet access in the US. Companies are granted local monopolies in exchange for maintaining the network.

That's how it ends with every services in a ""free market"". When a company is big enough, it uses its ressources to extinguish concurrents and/or negotiate each other monopoly fiefdoms and ends up in total control. Then they stop delivering said service and just pile up cash and force their clients to keep paying constantly more one way or another. Because in the US, companies exist for one and only one single purpose : gather as much cash &amp; power for its owners/executives as technically possible.

But yeah there's always an excuse to dismantle decent public service setting a quality floor and privatize everything to robber barons. ""it was not true free market"" ""it's a monopoly"" etc etc. Yeah whatever. 

Monopoly and abuse is the *only* way it can end without at least some degree of gov intervention setting boundaries not to cross (E.G: ""pay your employees"" ""dumping at loss just to kill concurrents is illegal"" ""bribing politicians to have monopoly is illegal"" ""buying every single other conccurrents throught wallstreet trading firms and law loopholes to dissolve it is illegal too"" etc etc). 

And that's also why libertarians hate so much the gov : it prevent them to go for their end game of having ALL the power and ALL the money of the system in their own hands. If they can steal both their customers and employees wages legally without ever paying any taxes it's even more cash for their own pocket.

The ""free market"" is just a nice term in the end for placing a company above the law and remove another concurrent they can't illeally bankrupt (the state), so that it can start its own monopoly and racket/forced cash grab.

That's completely nonsensical. US cultural influence is felt all over the world - everywhere where they have hollywood movies, hamburgers and blue jeans.

&gt;We were talking about guarantees as being guarantees of their cultural integrity, not as their political influence. Like France insisting that their radio be in french (Too late for Wales to do that, I guess).

You need political power to guarantee cultural independence.

&gt;Ideally? Certainly. But these sort of things are rarely ideal.

I didn't claim that. They have far more self-determination under this arrangement than any other available option.

&gt;Uhh, I think you need to establish the link between trading with china and the US and control over becoming a melting pot a little bit more strongly. I'm not following you here.

Hollywood movies, hamburgers and blue jeans.

&gt;And... if the EU does ever unify, you can say goodbye to America's military presence in Europe. Sorry, but there are definitely a lot of European countries that can keep their military small solely because of the US' guarantee. If the EU were to unify, y'all would have to stand entirely on your own two feet.

Whine whine. If you want NATO to mean anything then joint troop presence will remain normal in potentially threatened areas. The Mexican border, for example. But even if the EU were to be able to match the US military capacity, that still wouldn't go down well with a lot of people in the US simply because they like to operate under the assumption ""we don't need help"". In addition, the USA likes to chide Europe for not being as militarist as them (despites being comfortably second in military expenses worldwide), but also like the influence they have thanks to their lopsided military weight, so there's definitely a contradictory element in that policy. In any case, it's not going to change overnight, but the current saber rattling with Russia probably will speed up the development of a EU military and in any case increase military budgets of individual NATO members.",0,1414333294,null,0,false,0,clk659v,t3_2jz90h,t1_clk659v,t1_cljmnbt,null,1426343973,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

false,dalkon,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;  The foreskin is not a disease or a condition

That is exactly the issue at the heart of this debate. Those who support genital cutting consider the human penis to be innately deformed.

The cultural effects of involuntary non-therapeutic genital cutting are very interesting. The practice divides human cultures into two groups, those who respect children's bodies and those who think the intact penis needs destructive surgical ""correction.""

Of course it should be considered significant that the concept that the intact human genitalia is so flawed it requires destructive surgical correction is exactly the same idea behind female genital cutting. The cultural logic runs deeper. The idea that the foreskin is somehow feminine or vagina-like is present in some anti-foreskin cultures like much of Africa and the US. This creates a cultural idea of masculinizing the penis by amputating its feminine part. Female genital cutting is very often performed for the obvious corollary bad idea, feminizing the vulva by amputating its masculine part(s).

Along with the fact that the foreskin is normally a valuable part of the body (which is more obvious in genitally intact European cultures), the other key misunderstanding underpinning this debate (on finally restricting involuntary non-therapeutic genital modification) is that the anti-foreskin movement, the force promoting medicalized genital cutting, has never been acknowledged by the mainstream media. By ignoring the idea that their sort of bias exists, they've been able to misrepresent themselves and their biased findings as unbiased medical researchers and normal/legitimate research. They are propagandists misusing science to deceive to promote genital cutting for cultural or other purposes.

Europeans are in a much better position to see that this is obviously propaganda rather than legitimate science. Many European medical organizations and authorities have acknowledged the cultural bias in, for instance, the AAP's recommendation of parental choice in non-therapeutic/""elective"" genital cutting of children. Don't let these people deceive the world into cutting their children's genitals. They convinced the US to cut children's genitals when people had not developed any ethical ideas about respecting the child's right to autonomy over his (or her) own body using unbelievably terrible science. Unbelievably terrible science was all it took to convince people 100 years ago. Now they have much better (looking) research, and they're trying to expand genital cutting practices into Asia and South America and maintain legal protection of genital cutting in Europe despite the majority of European doctors opposing ""elective"" destructive genital modification (especially Northern European doctors).

\* Please don't let them succeed in deceiving the rest of the world.

Are you for real? Are you trolling because I really can't tell this time.

In the unlikely case that you really don't understand why you can't just pick and choose which parts of the EU you get to keep, I'll just point out that the EU is formed of 28 member states. Each of them wants and needs different parts of the EU treaties. 

The UK will **never** be allowed to remove the freedom of movement because the four pillars of the EU come as a package. Each member state likes some things and really dislikes others, but they accept those things they dislike because they consider that the positives of the things they like outweigh the negatives of the things they don't like.

The UK really likes the common market, but doesn't like free movement, if the UK actually tried to remove free movement some other EU members might very well remove the UK from the common market.

You only keep the parts you like only as long as the other EU members allow you to keep it, as such no nation will ever be allowed to pick and choose which parts of the EU it keeps. It can either accept the entire thing, both the good and the bad, or none at all.",0,1414334699,null,0,1414336452,0,clk6ncy,t3_2kcytx,t1_clk6ncy,t1_clk68sy,null,1426343738,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I think you should split them into smaller groups so that there is no division between performers and audience (the standard non-artistic variety of germans would rather DIE than do *anything* in front of an audience) but that everybody is a participating member. Use separate rooms if you can. Then introduce a competing factor.

false,dirkt,null,null,"&gt; German students have the tendency to shut down when they even have to think about justifying an opinion other than their own.

The important point is *justify*. The problem is not seeing or understanding a different opinion, or coming up with arguments for it. The problem is to pretend that it is *your own* opinion and to *defend* it like it was your own opinion. Because it isn't.

And the shutting down is just their reaction to someone forcing them to do something they can't understand, or they think makes no sense. They are smart. They can figure out make-pretend quickly. Try it a different way, and they'll be happy to cooperate.

&gt; In France, if you do not write both sides of an argument in a paper (example: yellow is good and yellow is bad), then you've only written half a paper. In the UK, it is still common to ask students to write papers exploring both sides of an issue. 

But then you derive a conclusion from that, and that is usually that the arguments on the one side outweight the arguments on the other side (which is the reason you wrote the paper in the first place, and looked at possible counterarguments). What they object to is not looking at both sides, what they object to is pretending that both sides are somehow equal, and you can pick a random side ""to be on"".

&gt; Only then, when the students realize realize that they will fail if they keep doing things the same old way, do they start to change. That's about the only thing that resonates.

Sure. You are forcing them to things in a way that don't make sense to them. So under threat of failure, they'll somehow imitate it. The first opportunity they get, they'll never do it again, and they will hate the whole thing from the bottom of their hearts. Not a good way to teach. But maybe necessary if your goal is to ""produce culture-apropriate work"". :-)

On a side note about nurses, in the US, many doctors and nurses at US hospitals are not allowed to tell parents *that the surgery is elective* or explain that the word elective means non-therapeutic. Only concerned with the money they make from the surgery, the hospitals want to take advantage of the fact that ignorant new parents often mistakenly assume the surgery is therapeutic.

&gt;They are smart. They can figure out make-pretend quickly. Try it a different way, and they'll be happy to cooperate.

Then what do you suggest?  At my present department, we've got a combined total over 100 years of teaching experience and have tried every strategy we could think of.

I didn't like the text books we used (Berliner Platz) since if I missed a day or wanted to review a topic at home, there was not much in the way of grammar explanations. However, I guess that was a side effect of having the books completely in German. 

The classes can be pretty hit or miss. If you sit in a few classes and see that it's not working out, then I would suggest changing sections (or schools). Having a lot of unmotivated classmates really affects the learning environment.

That said, I don't think I will go back. The administration side of the VHS Frankfurt is a mess and I don't feel like I really need classes at the moment.

I have a question for you: all member states, as we know, approved of the current calculation methods.

Because you are acting all high and mighty as if everything has been agreed upon.

That, is not sure at this point, so to be honest: Cameron might even be right. Of course, it is stupid and premature to say that the UK will not pay (as it might turn out that the UK indeed could have seen this coming and did agree to it).  Discarding all the other statements Cameron made in relation to the EU, he might actually be (legally) right here though.

[Podnar (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883821) found that foreskin destruction routinely depresses the ability to elicit a normal penile reflex response.

Quoting [Basu (2011)](http://books.google.com/books?id=8VMO3Vpqi0cC&amp;pg=PA81):

&gt; Circumcision is essentially a surgical excision of the prepuce and it involves removal of many of the fine-touch corpuscular receptors. The exposed glans mucosa after circumcision becomes abnormally keratinized with an increase in the number of cell layers in the mucosal epithelium of the glans. As the urethral meatus is exposed, it becomes prone to irritation. At operation, the frenular artery may need to be tied thus depriving the anterior urethra of its major blood supply. The combined effect of urethral ischemia and irritation may predispose to the development of meatal stenosis in 5-10% of circumcised males. As most of the penile dartos muscle is removed, only a few bundles of muscle are left at the circumcision scar. It has been observed that the flaccid penis in circumcised males tends to hang less vertically than in those with complete anatomy. Loss of dartos muscle support presumably explain this difference. Certainly, the loss of most of the penile dartos muscle renders positional adjustments of the penis during erection and with temperature changes, rather difficult. For unknown reasons, keloid formation after circumcision is quite rare.

&gt; Circumcision or amputation of the prepuce at the level of corona of glans removes many of the fine-touch corpuscular receptors from the penis. There are several different theories regarding what happens when the nerves of the sensory receptors of the prepuce are transected during circumcision. Some have speculated that after circumcision, these nerves regenerate and develop new encapsulated receptors. Accordingly, the proponents of this theory believe than any loss of these receptors is temporary and would not be apparent after 6 months of circumcision. However, this theory is contrary to human and animal studies that in a nerve transaction with amputation of the distal tissue, the proximal nerve undergoes acute axonal swelling. Without the distal nerve, attempts at reinnervation results in a bulbous, disordered tangle of axons, Schwann cells and fibrous tissue. Histology of the male circumcision scar shows amputation neuromas, Schwann cell proliferation and the bulbous collection of variably sized neuritis. Amputation neuromas do not mediate normal sensation and are notorious for generating pain. It is conjectured that any change in the sexual behavior after circumcision may be related to a central nervous system alteration by retrograde axonal degeneration, or to peripheral nervous system damage from loss of the prepuce-ridged bands and amputation neuroma.

In generally I'm against all opt-outs, however that does not mean that in some situations one might not be the right course of action. As long as the opt-out is limited in scope and has a good reasoning behind it.

All the current opt-outs, with the exception of the Euro one, are pretty minor in the grand scheme of things and don't really have an impact on the EU as a whole.

More importantly opt-outs can only be granted when a new law is adopted, the UK already accepted ""free movement"" as part of the EU, it can't and will not be granted an opt-out now. The only way the UK will get rid of ""free movement"" is by leaving the EU.

On the one hand, it's easy to write off this move as nothing more than just another example of old-fashioned racism and xenophobia. On the other hand, I can also sympathize with the Italian townspeople who may have had their lives negatively affected through no fault of their own. If one of the key modes of transportations in this region has substantially deteriorated once the Roma camp moved in, resulting in a steep increase in crime, to the point that people may fear for the personal security, it's understandable that this created resentment in the local community. 

The problem here as with the broader Roma problem is that a meaningful solution can only be implemented over the course of many years (decades perhaps) through a gradual integration of the community into broader society, especially through education, regular employment, and rising living standards. However, such changes have proven to be frustratingly slow, even when significant government resources and a host of policies were directed to explicitly tackle this problem as happened in many Eastern European countries during the socialist era. In the interim, it is in some sense unfair to force specific communities to be unduly burdened with the negative externalities of this society-wide problem.

The best solution I can think of in this case would be to have a pragmatic work-around. Perhaps offer an additional direct bus from the township to Turin with no stops in the vicinity of the Roma camp. This may create a safer short-term means of transportation for local residents without going as far as touching on thorny issues of racial discrimination.

false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I have a question for you: all member states, as we know, approved of the current calculation methods. More important however, and this is surrounded by mystery: did all member states authorize the EU to go back to as far as 1995 when calculating this rebate? Because you are acting all high and mighty as if everything has been agreed upon.

I would think so. When EU does something, it usually does it very throughly with a huge paper trail. Now you might ask the reason why for example Britain gave its permission to do so. The answer might be that the British government thought that the other EU states had stated their data worser than they had thus Britain would be receiving money back, or they thought that the figures would not go much in either way, which they didn't when you take into account the whole context.

&gt; That, is not sure at this point, so to be honest: Cameron might even be right. Of course, it is stupid and premature to say that the UK will not pay (as it might turn out that the UK indeed could have seen this coming and did agree to it). Discarding all the other statements Cameron made in relation to the EU, he might actually be (legally) right here though.

First of all the sums are not big, they are small or tiny. Second of all, if all member states agreed to recalculation, then that should be upheld. Not to mention that where some states have to now pay more, some member states already paid more for the beginning. It would be quite unfair to backtrack now.

&gt; Also, to get rid of the misconception: the EU didn't bring peace. The ECSC and moreover, the EEC, did that. Let us not paint a too romantic picture of the EU because of ideology. I agree with the rest of your comment.

EU is the ECSC, they just expanded their area of business and made re-branding couple of times. If you scratch enough, under the surface you will find the good old European Coal and Steel Union.

false,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"How closely it's followed is usually more of a social thing than strictly legal, though government policies can influence it. For example the [German spelling reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography_reform_of_1996) of 1996 received a lot of resistance, and was not universally followed. Often there needs to be a mix of social and official consensus to really make changes. For example, Swedish and Danish used to have a formal/informal ""you"" distinction until the 1960s (like German Du vs. Sie), but it was abolished within a surprisingly short period of time due to a mixture of official and social changes. The government stopped using the formal ""you"" in official communications, and several large organizations and newspapers followed suit, so it mostly dropped out of usage. This also coincided with a period of social liberalization when class distinctions and hierarchy were becoming seen as antiquated. Now the ""formal you"" is mostly seen as archaic and old-fashioned.

One interesting case is with Spanish: the [Spanish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola) periodically updates the spelling to keep it consistent with pronunciation. This is the main reason Spanish spelling is so much simpler than French. French has very conservative orthography, so retains some spelling features from centuries ago, which are no longer are reflected in the spoken language. But when the Spanish spoken language changes, the spelling is updated to match it, so there remains a 1:1 correspondence between the written and spoken language. One example is that the sounds for 'x' and 'j' mostly merged some time ago, and as a result, many words that once had an 'x' were respelled with a 'j' for consistency. An example familiar to English speakers is the novel *Don Quixote*: in modern Spanish editions the title is *Don Quijote*. One funny instance where this recommendation was not followed, however: the country of México made a point of retaining that spelling rather than moving to Méjico, on the grounds that a Spanish government agency cannot rename another country. (However, written Spanish in Mexico has made the x-&gt;j change for normal words, only excluding the name of the country and a few other names.)",0,1414340146,null,0,false,0,clk8xj2,t3_2kcvzw,t1_clk8xj2,t1_clk7dax,null,1426342674,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

""Ok guys. I'm from Borgaro, so I can tell you about the situation. The bus in question is only one (line 69 to be precise) which connects Borgaro to the northern side of Turin. From there i take other means of transport to get to the Polytechnic of Turin, since I study there. The problem with gypsies - not all of them, there's exceptions - is that basically they don't care about others. They eat and throw trash on the ground (or preferably on the seats), they're loud, they smell, and they spit on people. If there's many, and there's also students going/coming from school, they insult them and call them names. They often get physical and start some trouble. It happened to me sometimes to have to intervene (honestly I do it with a certain fear, you don't know how they could react). To me, personally, nothing serious ever
happened (though I've been spat on a few times), but I know of at least a boy they beat up. I never use my cell phone when there's gypsies on the bus, I try to sit as far as I can from them, and if not possible, I sit with my back against the window, so I can see the rest of the bus. It's a constantly tense situation, even when I'm almost sure nothing's gonna happen - almost. Make your own conclusion because I'm not gonna tell you how you should feel. The fact remains that the general consensus of the citizens using that bus is that it would be better without them.

false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; That source also shows that most people (51%) want to end the political links with Europe.

(An opportunity to recycle a comment I made about just that the other day.)

In that case, they'll have to leave the EU and EEA and negotiate a free trade agreement with the rest of us instead. A single market without political links is inherently impossible.  

To see why, you need to understand the difference between a free trade agreement, like what we have with e.g., South Korea, and the Single Market. A free trade area removes duties and attempts to reduce bureaucratic barriers of trade, depending on the negotiated agreement. That's also what most people think of when they hear ""Single Market"", but it's so much more. The Single Market aims to have a common set of rules and regulations that apply to all products and businesses within the EEA, no matter in which member state they operate. So, if a company buys a component from another, there is no need to verify that it is compliant with national regulations e.g., regarding safety or environmental impact. When a business enlists the service of a provider in another member state, it can be sure it will still be compliant with e.g., privacy requirements of its customers' data, and so on.  
The question arises how all those member states are supposed to agree on such common regulations, if not through a supranational body within which the legislative process takes place. That's why a common market is not possible without political links, unless you want to take the Norway route and simply adopt the directives without participating in the decision making process.

The benefits of being a large common market with shared regulations go beyond simplifying internal trade, btw. Since we share a common set of regulations, producers elsewhere take them into account before they even begin to design a new product. It's enough to have e.g., a new mobile phone certified in one member state, and it can go on sale throughout the entire EEA. We can also legislate things like the two year warranty or the electronic recycling directive and producers will implement it if they want to keep selling their stuff in the EU. Have a look around you and see how many things came with a CE mark on their package. They'd all have to go through various national certification processes if it weren't for the Single Market, and not all producers would bother for all their products.

In terms of migration, the logic behind this is that a worker is the smallest economic entity, and free to sell its services throughout the EEA without being at a disadvantage relative to national citizens elsewhere. This has been with us since the European Coal and Steel Community from 1951. It's the same principle under which the former national monopolies e.g., in telecommunication have been dissolved. There may be some leeway when workers don't actually engage in economic activity, but the principle itself is really quite fundamental.",0,1414340649,null,0,false,0,clk95y0,t3_2kcytx,t1_clk95y0,t1_clk4h88,null,1426342565,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In these times the sums of money we are talking about are pretty big. As for the Netherlands, the country that has to pay the most next to Britain, I can say that such money is not available at this point. The government has been pushed to its limits by a whole range of austerity measures and we simply don't have that money lying around. The Dutch finance minister has pretty much said the same. Hence, new austerity measures to pay for this are very probable.

There have been huge expansions in powers compared to the ECSC (and even the EEC) treaty. Expansions that I pretty much support but which have resulted in friction on more than one occassion. The post-war European landscape was built on economic cooperation, not integrated political and financial cooperation as we see it nowadays. Both cannot be compared as if they are the same, because both differ more than significantly.  Just for fun compare the ECSC Treaty with the current Treaties. So much is different.

No it didn't. We had a chance to end our civil war in 2006. Instead the Bush Admin accused Somali groups of being terrorists, armed and funded the warlords who destroyed our country and helped other Africans to occupy our country. The worst part was that 20k people died before the US realised they fucked up. Clinton eventually got the people that were accused of being terrorists in the government but by then it was to late. Too many people lost too many relatives. Now AQ is in Somalia and they have deep support.

&gt; Russia has a falling ruble because of no trade. Only the ruble is falling. The dollar isn't rising at the speed the ruble is falling. All time low for Russia and just gets worse even after Russia attempts to bail it out.

Thats a sweeping and very wrong comment. Of course Russia has trade, it would have collapsed otherwise. Russia has also barely made any effort to fix their currency. They've got the the third largest currency reserves in the world and they're sitting on. The devaulation is bad short term for Russia but good long termwise. They've been suffering from the Dutch disease. In the domestic market, local companies simply aren't competative. In a few years they have to reduce tarrifs. A weak currency is good for them. They always expect oil and gas to hide the serious defects in their economy.

&gt; Political uncertainty would not be an issue if Russia had massive world support. All your excuses explain Russia being isolated and claim otherwise. Going to a conference doesn't mean those countries support you. There are no countries that matter that are actively supporting Russia. Please tell me what major countries have the back of Russia?

 Political uncertainty would always be an issue. No matter how you slice it, the EU and the US are the most powerful blocs economically. India and China are nowhere near them. Russia doesn't need active and open support. Its a UNSC member so its not at risk of legally binding sanctions. What it does need is for countries to isolate them.

Of the picture: Only one of them is in prison(Jaume Matas). And none of them has been accused in court for the envelops in cash with some money for expenses that they got from the treasurer. The current PM got an average of €50,000 euros/year in 19 years. The party reformed recently the headquarters with black money, the conclusion is going to be again that the treasurer did it without the knowledge of anybody else in the party.

EDIT: Remember Rajoy hasn't been accused of anything he said that he discovered that the party that he leads was financed illegally by the press and that he though that getting 50,000 euros/year in cash for personal expenses besides a 100,000 euros/year salary from the party and non telling to the tax service about the cash was legal. And the judge decided not to accuse him or anybody in a similar situation.

The official version over the illegal funding of the party between 1990 and 2008 is that the treasurer did everything alone. Yes the hundreds of millions of euros paid for the contracts of the motorways, the airports, the rails, the legal protection for the illegal housing in the Mediterranean... everything without the knowledge of the direction of the party.

They remained in areas of Samogitia and Auksztota. Definitely not in Wilno region, which was predominantly Polish (and remains so - in rural areas - to this day).

&gt;What right had Poland to annex our capital city?

It wasn't your capital city. It was the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a part of the Commonwealth over a hundred years earlier, and the only thing it had in common with the new ""Lithuanian"" nation state was its name.

&gt;The same right as Russia taking Crimea and Eastern Ukraine?

Has Russia lost Crimea in January 2014 or in 1954? Because if the former was true, then your analogy would bear some resemblance of truth.

&gt;Lets take our ""brother's"" capital because there's lots of Polish/Polonised Lithuanians and because it's a weaker state.

Or rather let's secure the important centre of Polish culture inhabited mostly by Poles, which is also claimed (on a very weak basis) by our ""brothers"".

&gt;But of course they teach you that mean old Lithuania broke the friendship? 

The friendship was broken much earlier, during the Russian occupation in 19th century, when Lithuanians started treating Poles living in areas of the Grand Duchy as ""Lithuanians, who think who are Poles"" (this kind of thinking is very prevalent in your country, I saw examples of it even in this very thread).

**Clean bill of health for Greek banks from stress tests**

Greek banks received what amounts to a virtually **clean bill of health** from the European Central Bank, as the results of the stress tests Frankfurt performed on the four systemic lenders of this country showed on Sunday that Alpha and Piraeus have completed the exercise successfully through their dynamic picture, and only Eurobank and National need to cover the **negligible amount of 291 million euros in tota**l.

**""Eurobank has practically no shortfall and National Bank of Greece has no shortfall,""** read the ECB statement on Sunday afternoon.
The results are not only a major boost for the local credit sector, but also for the government as they allow it to handle the reserves of about 11.3 billion euros at the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund for alternative purposes, such as the reduction of the national debt.
Piraeus Bank showed capital needs of 660 million euros according to the data up to December 31, 2013, but the restructuring plan that the bank has submitted and partly implemented already cover all of its needs, according to Reuters.

National Bank announced that its capital needs based on its static picture (end-2013 data) amounted to 3.43 billion euros, but its plan on restructuring its assets and operations has diminished its requirements to just 273.28 million euros. This will likely be covered by the sale of shares in Finansbank, National's Turkish subsidiary.

Eurobank announced that its original deficit, calculated using the end-December 2013 picture, came to 4.63 billion euros, but following its share capital increase of 2.86 billion euros and the restructuring plan submitted, its requirements amount to no more than 17.55 million euros.

Okay, now think for a minute: what is the point of having a difference between ""this"" and ""that""? ""This"" means ""the one which I am pointing to, and which is closer to me than the other"", and ""that"" means ""the one which I am pointing to, and which is further away from me than the other"".

Formally, German does make the same careful distinction: ""dieser/diese/dieses"" means ""this"", and ""jener/jene/jenes"" means ""that"".

Colloquially, though, it is rarely necessary to make that distinction, so Germans tend to use ""der/die/das"" and ""dieser/diese/dieses"" to mean both ""this"" and ""that"". Even if you're not actually pointing to it with your index finger, you'll be gesturing towards it, or looking at it, or the context will make it obvious anyway. ""Jener/jene/jenes"" is a bit old-fashioned.

How could Poland claim Vilnius as it's own because of former Žečpospolitians living in it? Will I get a Polish passport, because my last name has a Lithuanian nobility/ Polish origin? Can USA annex my country because I speak English? Was it right for Nazi Germany to annex Sudetenland and Austria because of their language? 

&gt; It wasn't your capital city. It was the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a part of the Commonwealth over a hundred years earlier, and the only thing it had in common with the new ""Lithuanian"" nation state was its name.

But it always has been except those ~19 years when Poland had it. It was the capital city of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, still is the capital of Lithuania and always will be. Regarding other things you said, the same thing could be said about Poland. 

&gt;Has Russia lost Crimea in January 2014 or in 1954? Because if the former was true, then your analogy would bear some resemblance of truth.

Oh but it's relevant.

&gt; Or rather let's secure the important centre of Polish culture inhabited mostly by Poles, which is also claimed (on a very weak basis) by our ""brothers"".
Centre of Polish culture? That's a new one.

&gt; The friendship was broken much earlier, during the Russian occupation in 19th century, when Lithuanians started treating Poles living in areas of the Grand Duchy as ""Lithuanians, who think who are Poles"" (this kind of thinking is very prevalent in your country, I saw examples of it even in this very thread). No wonder our relations deteriorated with such attitude from you.

19th century was time of national revival. When Polish got offended that Lithuanians don't want to be polonized anymore. We were in danger of losing our cultural identity as a nation. And our relationship deteriorated after Poland refused to recognize Lithuania as a new country and latter on broke the Suvalkų agreement.

He is in an awkward position, on one hand all the major tory supporters such as business and banks want to stay in the EU, but on the other hand Cameron is trying to win some of that sweet sweet UKIP electorate. So he is trying to give the illusion to the plebs that he is for a Exit, while quietly reassuring that banks and business that he will ensure the UK stays in the EU and that this is just a charade to increase the Tory portion of the electorate.

There are 3 realistic outcomes:

1) Success, Cameron plays though with the EU, wins UKIP electorate, hold referendum, campaigns pro EU, hopefully it is smoother than the Scotish referndum, Britain chooses to stay in the EU and win win win for the Tories.

2)Failure, Banks and Business get too scared, and switch all their support to Labour helping them win the general elections.

3) Giant Failure, UKIP electorate does not trust Cameron still votes UKIP, Banks and Business don't trust Cameron switch support to Labour. Labour wins elections, UKIP places second and the Torries end up a farcical third.

TL;DR It's a bold move Cotton, lets see if it pays off.

&gt;Can USA annex my country because I speak English?

&gt;But it always has been except those ~19 years when Poland had it.

Istanbul will always be a capital of Greece except for those years when Turkey had it.

&gt;It was the capital city of Grand Duchy of Lithuania

Precisely. Connection between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a multi-national country speaking Old Ruthenian, Polish, and Lithuanian, with only the two first languages being official ones, and the Republic of Lithuania, a nation state with Lithuanian being its sole language and descending from a ethnic group which made up only a few percent of Grand Duchy's population is vague at best.

Your ethnic area got smaller, tough luck. It happened to many nations throughout history.

No, our relationship deteriorated after Lithuania has started claiming areas which had nothing in common with Lithuanian nation save vague historical connection.

Ich bin dieses und letztes Wochenende zu meiner Freundin gezogen und stecke immer noch in den Nachbereitungen. Leider ist das Zimmer kleiner als das vorige, sodass ich alles besser organisieren (= viel wegschmeißen) muss. Das Zusammenleben klappt aber bisher sehr gut.

Ansonsten das übliche Spiel aus Uni + Arbeit. Abends dann mit Freunden ein Glas Wein oder Tee trinken und quatschen. Ist echt wichtig, sich soziale Zeit zu nehmen.

Dann ist mir heute aufgefallen, dass diese Woche gar keine Amerikanischen Serien liefen (Daily Show und so). Grund: es ist Major League Baseball World Series. Interessanterweise sind die San Francisco Giants im Finale (bzw. der World Series). Da ich im September in den USA war und mir dort ein Baseballspiel der SF Giants angesehen hab, war ich natürlich erfreut und versuche mir jetzt das letzte Spiel anzusehen.

War ganz kurz mit ner Freundin im Möbelhaus, was wegen einer neuen Küche regeln (für sie).

Sonst auch krank gewesen und daher zwei kleine Parties verpasst, sau ärgerlich. 

Nächste Woche auch nur Uni, einen halben Tag arbeiten (Stundenplan erlaubt nicht mehr) und am Dienstag krieg ich Damenbesuch zum Kochen und Film schauen. Wird aber unspektakulär, man ist ja befreundet :)

But on a more serious note: Filipinos do not have some innate ability to integrate. We're like all immigrants: some participate in their host society, some don't and some are closed off altogether. Why you won't see any les francaises philippines is because the first destination most PH immigrants go to is the US of A. IIRC around 4 million are there: that's 40% of the total Filipino immigrants around the world. 

After that it's either the Mid East or the rest of South East Asia. Then the others...
I think that there may be some correlation between integration and the number of immigrants: if immigrants are more dispersed, provided the host countries are welcoming, they tend to better integrate more. Compare that to when they huddle together and establish little ""bubbles"" of their old country, where they speak their own language still, consume the entertainment and culture of their host country and generally fraternise with those of their old country.

In the UK, there really aren't many of us: around 100,000. Most are in or around London (duhh...), whilst the rest are scattered all over England. There may be tiny pockets in Wales, NI and Scotland and there's also those in Ireland to consider.

The Philips here are generally integrated. Although that is not to say we're angels: baluts have a bad reputation as immigrants in SE Asia and in the Mid East and overseas Filipinos have done some rather.....stupid shit in the past that is just purely embarrassing e.g. the murder of Philip Lawrence.

Even if we were to adopt a **crazy** idea that like half of ""separatists"" in South-East are Russian troops, the overall number with all the rotation every other month or so would be around 30k. (given that usual estimate of ""separatists"" numbers varies from 10 to 20k). 


Russia has a population of 146 million people, 30000/1460000=0,02% of population actively participated in the conflict (and this is extremely generous, borderline *Ukraine level of estimates*).


How come simple math does not add up with what you are saying?  How come you think that Bulgarians, Romanians, Baltics or Poles are fine, objective and level headed European citizens, but Russian want to literally kill everyone?


How come Soviet Union in height of Cold War did not nuked the world during Cuban crisis and the level of antagonism back then was way, way higher than nowadays?


There is a significant difference in semantics what exactly Russians might support (and i would argue the 80% number is bullshit in itself due to variety of reasons), but even if i were to take your statement at face, Russians might support Putin as a sole political figure on our whole political field worth listening to or supporting, *everyone else is not trustworthy  at all*.

Je pense qu'une partie importante de la France a longtemps eu un avis très bipolaire sur le sujet. J'avoue ne pas être historien, et pas plus versé en Histoire de France que le premier clampin venu, mais je pense que des ouvrages comme Les Misérables pourraient t'éclairer un peu sur une vision où l'adoration de Napoléon et l'adoration de la République a pu exister. Surtout dans la période comprise entre le règne de Napoléon et l'arrivée de la République. Ca paraît assez étrange, mais pas impossible.

Si Napoléon ne représente pas la démocratie, il a représenté une France forte, unie, triomphant de l'ennemi, et a marqué certains progrès. Même s'il s'agit de totalitarisme, cela a peu à voir avec la royauté, et je pense donc que ce qu'il symbolise en est très loin. Après c'est juste mon avis personnel, à peu près entièrement tiré de ma seule lecture traitant du sujet.

But I do am a bit annoyed by the UK its behavior, as this is a supranational  union of 28 member states of which almost all do not share the UK its vision. Let it be clear that the UK is free to go (I've said that elsewhere as well), but cutting the UK loose should not result in more net benefits for Britain. That would actually encourage more member states to leave, which is detrimental to European integration.
 
So yes, there is a dimension of 'punishment', though I did not come up with that. There have been more than enough signals from Brussels that an EU-light will not be accepted with regard to the UK. Maybe if the UK would have taken another, less damaging approach then renegotiations (if they even ever will take place)  would indeed be easier in the future.  As it stands now, the UK will be made an example off during an exit, not in the first place for already partially turning its back on the member states on which this experiment thrives.

It's their fucking ""culture"" that's the problem. When me and my wife had our second kid we had to register her at government office and there was Roma couple registering their third kid, he was 19, she was 18, he has 7 grades of elementary school, she has 5.

**They** pull their kids out of schools as soon as they turn 15 (there is no mandatory education after you turn 15 years). As soon as they pull their daughters from school they sell them into arranged marriages.

It's bloody obvious that his job is not to make Poles live better in Lithuania, but to destroy the unity of the country using Polish minority the same way as Russian minority is used in Latvia. 

As an example, he's been noticed wearing the St. George's ribbon, but during the embargo of Polish apples he didn't participate in the events run by Liberals and Conservatives of Lithuania to support Poland over this issue.

The stereotypically uneducated, poor and politically ignorant Polish-Russian-Lithuanian villagers in Vilnius district, who may even have grandparents of 3 or 4 different nationalities, vote for Tomaszewski because 'hurr durr Polan', while many Polish people I know or follow through Facebook often prefer Liberal parties over Tomaszewski's pro-Kremlin populist bloc because Liberals are proper Liberals - always supportive of ethnic, sexual, etc, etc, minorities.

As a result of the situation I described, what the Polish minority around Vilnius gets from the middle-class and higher citizens of Lithuania is a never ending hate-train for being destructive to the state and laughed at in the Lithuanian Internets for actually voting against their own well-being. Also, since Tomaszewski's task is to be vocal to other countries, I found him often cited in various articles, putting every ignorant Polish person who reads those articles and agrees with Tomaszewski in a bad light as well.

At that point Gypsy parents get their kids out of school and into their ""cultural work"" like collecting garbage, begging and worse.

There are Gypsy kids who want to escape that life and state provides shelters and education for them. There are Gypsy girls who run away from their parents when they sell them into marriage and state provides them with shelters.

&gt;Ova sumorna priča iz sisačkog predgrađa mučna je sjećanja prizvala 19-godišnjoj Čakovčanki Blaženki Ignac

19 year old Gypsy girl Blaženka Ignac tells her story

&gt;""Rođena sam u velikoj, deseteročlanoj obitelji u romskom naselju u Piškorovcu. Kada sam sa šest godina poželjela krenuti u školi, roditelji su poludjeli jer su smatrali da sam potrebnija kod kuće. 'Što će ti škola, ionako ćemo te udati', govorili su mi"", prisjeća se Blaženka koja je unatoč protivljenju roditelja čvrsto odlučila krenuti u školu. 

I was born in a big family of 10. When I wanted to go to school at age 6 parents told me ""you don't need school, we will marry you""

&gt;Prvih dana dolazila sam prljava, raščupana i poderane odjeće, ali i tako mala znala sam da nešto moram učiniti od svog života. Kod kuće je bio živi pakao: otac je fizički zlostavljao našu majku, zbog čega je na kraju dobio i dvije i pol godine kazne zatvora.

I was dirty and in ripped/damaged clothes. It was hell at home, father abused mather and got 2.5 years in prison in the end for that.

&gt;Sa 16 godina prvi put sam se zaljubila, ali otac je imao druge planove za mene. Odlučio me prodati u obitelj ženika kojega je već odredio, za gajbu piva.

At 16 I fell in love, but father had other plans .... he decided to sell me for a box of beer

&gt;Otišla sam u centar za socijalnu skrb i rekla im da ću trgovačku školu, koju sam pohađala, završiti milom ili silom. Nastala je strahovita svađa, morala sam bježati""

I went to Social services, told them I want to finish school .... I had to run away.

&gt;Željka Balog, učenica varaždinske srednje škole, prisjetila se mučnog slučaja kad je djevojka prodana u Italiju za 5.000 eura. Premda i sama Romkinja, mentalitet njezina naroda koji podržava ovakve mučne događaje ni najmanje se ne sviđa Dijani Balog, 19-godišnjakinji iz Puščina koja pohađa prvu godinu sestrinstva na višoj školi. 

Željka Balog remembers when a girl was sold to Italy for 5000 Euros.

&gt;""Protivim se ranim udajama, toj okrutnoj tradiciji. Blaženkin primjer vrlo je važan za našu zajednicu jer on pokazuje da se može istupiti iz tog zatvorenog kruga i nastaviti s civiliziranim životom. Mi mladi Romi mislimo da je to moguće, ali treba biti uporan"", kaže Dijana. 

I am against early marriage, that awful tradition"" says Dijana (19)

&gt;""Strašno je vidjeti kad dolaze prosci s dobrim autima, okićeni zlatnim nakitom, a roditelji mladih djevojaka na to 'padaju'. Zna se i 'tarifa': ako je cura djevica, košta 15.000 kuna, a ako se pokaže da to nije, onda vraća 7.500 kuna. Mora otkriti tko joj je bio prvi, ali nije on taj koji dobiva batine, već ona"", otkriva ovaj otac u nadi da će se istina prestati skrivati. 

Father of one of these girls tells about these marriages .... ""the price is know, 2000 Euros for a virgin, 1000 Euros if she isn't a virgin. if she isn't a virgin, she has to tell who it was and then she is beaten"".

So, once again .... how the fuck is this racism when they are given same opportunities and chances and state does whatever it can to help them, but they refuse and do shit like this? And why it is racism to point these things?

EEA or EU countries between them have no restrictions whatsoever between free movement of services,people,goods and capital,among many other things. This is what you get in the EU ,this is what Switzerland and Norway get in the EEA. This is not what Korea or Canada gets. 

If UK joins the EEA then they need to adhere to EU laws (including free movement of people), just as Switzerland and Norway do,but they don't get any say in them as they're not EU Members.So if the UK would leave the EU,but would join the EEA it would be the most stupid thing that you could possibly do. You still have no limit on immigration,you still have all EU laws being binding.Everything exactly the same. You even pay more to the EU budget.The only difference is that you don't have any more say in the EU.

What Canada and Korea get is a free trade agreement. This is essentially what USA would get as soon as negotiations finish. A free trade agreement is an agreement in which terms are negotiated on a case by case basis between two or more parties. The terms are negotiated based on so many factors, and the more powerful economic body will get a better deal in this agreement.


The UK will have to trade with the EU, but the EU will not have to trade with the UK.I haven't even looked into the Canada and Korea trade agreements,but I have no doubt that the agreements are very preferential towards the EU. I imagine that if the UK leaves and tries to negotiate its own ""free trade agreement"" it would get a crazy bad deal. All the european companies that right now have to compete with UK companies will lobby to restrict and make it as difficult as possible for UK companies to trade and enter the EU market. Not to mention lack of good-will on behalf of the EU and the geo-political obligation to make it difficult for the UK so that a dangerous precedent where a country can just leave the EU and there's no consequences. If there's a negotiation where you have almost no power, it's this one.


Wikipedia : In economics, an international free trade agreement is an agreement that results from cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers—import quotas and tariffs— and to increase trade with each other.

 In a free trade agreement restrictions can exist and do exist. Look up free trade agreement that don't allow trade of good x,y, or allow only for 500 tonnes of good z. Import and export duties are still there and the % of tax is subject to negotiation. A free trade agreement is simply an agreement that allows for trade between two parties. It's can be from free to very protectionist. By no means is a free trade agreement actually FREE TRADE. Quotas,subsidies,tariffs,restrictions still apply. Only thing is that now they're subject to negotiation between the two or more parties in the agreement.

false,John_Wilkes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The UK will not simply get a FTA with ""free trade of goods and services"", the EU would at that point have no economic reason to do it and even more importantly, politics would dictate that Brussels take a very hard stance on the UK. Even for a simple FTA the UK would have to make concessions, big ones, without a doubt.

I simply disagree. Free trade is worth more for the side with the trade surplus, which is the EU, and also for the side that is growing slowly, also the EU. The moment the UK left the leaders of both sides would insist on maintaining a close friendship, and they wouldn't want to screw over exporting companies on either side. 

&gt; If the UK will want actual access to the Single Market, like Switzerland or Norway have, than at that point it's almost certain you'll have to accept a Norway type solution and be ruled by fax. The Switzerland model is looked on as overtly complex and while Switzerland can keep it as a legacy issue, no new country will be given such option.

Again, it would depend on what you mean by ""access"". Access is a matter of degrees. Canada and Korea gets almost as much as Norway and Switzerland, without most of the drawbacks. If you think there's a big difference, can you even list out the major distinctions?

&gt; You seem to think FTA are some magical tool, they aren't. Hell Marocco has an FTA with the EU if I remember correctly.

FTAs can vary enormously in scope and scale. The Korea and Canada are ""next generation"" ones which cover services and non-tariff barriers. Those come pretty close to single market membership. I don't know enough about the Morocco one to comment there. I accept there will be some economic losses from leaving, but I don't think they will be particularly significant, and I think it will be worth it to get FTA access to NAFTA and emerging markets far more quickly, as well as to limit low skill migration.",0,1414352556,null,0,false,0,clkfmp3,t3_2kcytx,t1_clkfmp3,t1_clkf7y7,null,1426339537,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

No. At any time in any member state, people have freedom to elect an anti-everything party and get out of all treaties.

We should definitely should not be reading what has been leaked, because A) how can we know that it is a real leak? B) will it be in the final treaty? and C) how does fit the whole context? If you are a concerned citizen, what you should do is to contact your MPs and tell them what are your concerns ""I don't want to eat GM food"", ""I don't want labor legislation weakened"", etc... so that when the final treaty is ready, those MPs have an opinion about what is important with their electorates and to which parts they should put their emphasis.

Was this bus line started as segregated? No.

The article is about people getting fed up with shit Roma do and want to enter a fucking bus without being spat on by some fucking Gypsy. 

&gt;This is the translated top comment on the corresponding thread in /r/italy:

&gt;""Ok guys. I'm from Borgaro, so I can tell you about the situation. The bus in question is only one (line 69 to be precise) which connects Borgaro to the northern side of Turin. From there i take other means of transport to get to the Polytechnic of Turin, since I study there. The problem with gypsies - not all of them, there's exceptions - is that basically they don't care about others. **They eat and throw trash on the ground (or preferably on the seats), they're loud, they smell, and they spit on people. If there's many, and there's also students going/coming from school, they insult them and call them names. They often get physical and start some trouble.** It happened to me sometimes to have to intervene (honestly I do it with a certain fear, you don't know how they could react). To me, personally, nothing serious ever happened (though I've been spat on a few times), but I know of at least a boy they beat up. I never use my cell phone when there's gypsies on the bus, I try to sit as far as I can from them, and if not possible, I sit with my back against the window, so I can see the rest of the bus. It's a constantly tense situation, even when I'm almost sure nothing's gonna happen - almost. Make your own conclusion because I'm not gonna tell you how you should feel. The fact remains that the general consensus of the citizens using that bus is that it would be better without them. Frankly it's hard to explain this situation and how people who - unlike me - can't even defend themselves feel, especially high school kids and women in general.""

So? Who is making problems here? Who is the reason they are thinking about segregated bus???? Would you use this bus line? Would you?

I don't think you Europeans (#notAllEuropeans) understand how naïve you sound when you make posts like this. ""Oh, Roma aren't just any underclass. They're especially bad! They commit real crimes! They don't even want our social services! They're so ungrateful!"" Yes. Like every other underclass on the fucking planet.

&gt; These people don't want to ""live a normal life"".

No shit, Sherlock. That's why if they commit crimes, you put them in prison. An unpleasant one. Then if they do it again, you put imprison them for a longer period of time. Etc. I guess maybe your police don't do that? They just ask them real politely to please stop? Putting individuals in prison based strictly on the crimes they commit is how you keep the public out of harms way without resorting to disturbing racist policies like separate buses or making them wear Stars of David or engaging in mass ethnic deportations or any other latently fascist policy brewing in your subconscious minds.

&gt; I think if they'd ever somehow spread to North America you would just put them behind bars after an (legally) unfair trial and few people would complain about it. That's how bad these people are.

You are kidding, right? Do you not know that thanks to our history of industrial-scale slavery and our more recent history of institutionalized racism and crappy social policies, we have an impoverished black underclass with rates of violence and other criminality that make Roma look like fucking angels. Do we segregate buses? No. We put cameras on them and prosecute the shit out of people who break the law. That doesn't mean there isn't a chance you'll get hassled riding the bus through the inner city, but you don't see us segregating our fucking buses. Shit, the fight against segregated busing was one of the centerpieces of our civil rights movement. And we are better for it. Segregating buses is not just intrinsically wrong, but itself exacerbates the social problems it seeks to ignore.

&gt;So the innocent Roma should be punished because there are bad ones?

Usually, when they set up a camp, 99% of those in the camp are bad ..... these are those who refuse to integrate into society and stick to their ""traditions"" and ""culture"" (begging, stealing and other shit).

What should ... as you say ... innocent ... Italians do? If they set up a camp, these are nomadic Roma, the worst kind, those who don't even try to integrate into society and live according to their traditions.

They even claim God gave them permission to steal, that's how deeply this way of life is part of them.

It's too simplistic to say that Scots eat a bad diet, that's a wrap. There are other factors at plat. For example, Scotland's economy is very strongly recovering from de-industrialisation now and life expectancies are rebounding. That's coming from a declining alcohol intake, more exercise, better diet (of course) and less smoking. 

There's no way that one factor is at play here, and that's shown in the evidence.

Most ukrainians parties don't have an exact political ideology they follow, they just support a certain direction of politics. For example the PPB and PF follow a pro-european direction of ukrainian politics and also every aspects that come with it: democracy etc. They both want to make the military more powerful, but I think that it is the idea of every political force (except the Opposition Bloc I think). I think that the People's Front is a bit more ""radical"" in their position towards the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which is probably the reason why I read that the People's Front is ""nationalist"" in german newspapers.

The Samopomich party is a fairly new party, personally that's the party I would've voted for if I could (I am 17). They support a decentralization of the power, making the the regions more autonomous to structure more democratic way. 

Opposition Bloc, well, they pretty much consist of Party of Regions members. They don't accept that a lot of Ukraine's problems exist because of the former government(s), and blame the current government and pro-western political forces for it. They're pro-russian.

Radical Party of Lyashko. Well he is a right populist who likes to shout some radical stuff in order to get support. For example executing separatists en masse. In Ukraine there were people who took him seriously. But a few days ago a video was leaked where it was shown, that many of his videos where he presented himself as a hero in the ATO zone were mostly set up, his support dropped to 6,4%.

Svoboda. Well, I think you know a lot about them. I see them as mostly nationalist with a few ""more-than-nationalist"" members and policies, while some others see them as hardcore fascists and neo-nazis.  

Batkyvchina. The party of Julya Tymoshenko, who was imprisioned when Yakunovich was ruling the country. Her party is pro-european and I think also pro-Nato.

false,jarhead-in-germany,UNSA,USA,"I'm not a German, but I'm an American living in Germany so I might be able to give you some insight on the German snacks that an American might gravitate towards.  We do ""snack boxes"" a few times a year back to friends in the states with stuff we find in Germany and other European countries and they're always a big hit.  

First off, if it's not too late, I'd suggest dropping the Ritter Sport and the Haribo Goldbaren.  They're both fantastic snacks and I eat more of both than I should, but they are pretty common in the US.

Aside from that, though, excellent choices in your package.  You might want to consider adding these though if you have room:

Milka Snax, particularly the Daim variety (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Milka-Daim-Snax-2er-Pack/dp/B005187BOO).  It's almost like a chocolate-covered Bugle, if you remember those, with Daim butter almond in it.  Fantastic.

NicNac's (http://www.lorenz-snackworld.de/en/node/351).  These are, by far, my favorite German snack along with flippies (the ""Curly Peanuts"" you already have).  They're basically peanuts with a crunchy (I'm assuming fried) coating on it.  So good, and every American I've ever introduced to them has become instantly hooked.

Milka Löffe-Ei (https://www.milka.de/Produkte/MilkaL%C3%B6ffel-EiHerbstZeit?categoryId=2469).  I tend to see these things more seasonally, so they may not be easily available right now, but they're chocolate eggs with vanilla, chocolate, or another kind of filling.  They come in 4- packs with little spoons to crack the top of the egg (supposed to be reminiscent of a soft boiled egg, I guess) and then eat out the filling.  

Super Dickman -- They're chocolate covered marshmallows.  I'm not a big marshmallow fan, but come on, they're named ""Super Dickman"".

Other Potato Chip Flavors -- Not sure what you have available, but there are a lot of really unusual potato chip flavors here aside from just paprika.  Bacon flavor (although I've heard that's becoming common in the states), roasted chicken flavor, thai chili flavor...all kinds.  

Hope that helps.  Your international snack box concept seems fantastic and I wish you good luck in getting it off the ground!  ",0,1414355448,null,0,false,0,clkh6cq,t3_2ke018,t1_clkh6cq,t3_2ke018,null,1426338816,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

I'm but no. Time and time again you've come up with statements based on emotions rather than reality. You are the one grasping at straws. International diplomacy doesn't happens. 

&gt; What actions makes China ""support"" Russia to where they are actively taking a side and it is clearly Russia's. China just took advantage of Russia by Russia finally caving and signing an energy deal with China where they end up selling fuel for cheaper than they sell to EU. Russia has no leverage because of pissing off EU. Russia is cornered.

This is what I am talking. Emotional statement not based on facts. How do you know the Russians got a bad deal? People are making conjectures by dividing roughly. The Russians have stated the pipeline won't be in full capacity in the beginning and that prices are around $390. Higher than the average EU price but lower than LNG prices.

&gt; I don't care about India-Pakistan wars from decades ago. India does a ton of trade with West and they clearly have relations with countries all over the world. India has a good relationship with the West. Again, show me how India has taken the side of Russia where they clearly are against the West and openly support Russia.

You may not care but guess who does? [Yeah its India!](http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/india-backs-russias-legitimate-interests-in-ukraine/). Nobody likes being threathned, belitted or sanctioned. Only a few months ago the US considered PM Modi persona non grata. American foreign policy is never fully thought.

2: I don't think you know much about international relations. Let me spell out the obvious. The vast majorities don't give a shit, they just don't want to be under the spotlight. Since Russia is a UNSC member there can't be any legally binding sanctions enacted. So most countries will make a generic statement caliing for peace. The real question is, what do they actually do?

Japan enacted sanctions even though it didn't have to. China ignored a delegation sent by Obama and signed more than 40 deals with Russia. Brazil is scrambling to pick up the market share left by European agriculture ban in Russia.

That is how diplomacy works. International relationships take years to build and are easily screwed up.

&gt;Utvrdili smo da puno problema nastaje onog trenutka kada djeca navrše 15 godina i izgube socijalna prava. Ta djeca koja su na neki način bila potrebna svojim obiteljima jer su na temelju njih dobivali socijalnu pomoć, tada izlaze na cestu i tu nastaju na problemi. Drugo je pitanje općenito način trošenja socijalne pomoći, troši li se ta pomoć za alkohol ili za stvarne potrebe života. Treći dio je edukacija i priprema za zaposlenje. Pritom moram spomenuti da smo mi sada u situaciji da se te ljude u principu stimulira da se ne zaposle jer su im socijalna davanja veća od onog što mogu zaraditi radom - naglasio je Ostojić.

Rough translation: The most problems start when the kids are 15 years old and the families lose social security payments (welfare) which they were getting for their kids. Then they start street life and problems start. Second issue is how they use welfare, for the needs of the kids or alcohol. Third issue is education.

As I said, they pull their kids out of schools when they reach 15 years and send them on the streets to beg, collect garbage or steal. Daughters are married by the time they reach 18, usually in arranged marriage. They also have tobe virgins and if they are not virgins when they marry they are beaten.

""we have to blame ourselves, Gypsy won't betray other Gypsy. That's us. That's not good, we should report those who do criminal acts""

&gt;Ovi naši mali Romi prvo se ovdje uče lopovluku i “polažu ispite”. Tu se krade, ulaze kroz prozore i usavršavaju “zanat”, a onda odu profesionalno krasti. To se događa ovdje i ne smijemo gledati nikome kroz prste želimo li smanjiti kriminal. Oni su naša sramota. Mi šutimo, a to ne valja, moramo surađivati s policijom

""Our little Roma first learn how to steal and then take exams. They steal, enter through windows and practice their ""profession"" and then they go to be professional thiefs. This is happening here and we shouldn't just sit on it if we want to have less crime. They are our shame. We keep silent and that is not good, we should cooperate with police.""

This is Roma speaking about other Roma.

most of the money from west to east went into social care and there especially into pensions, since (according to the study) in the GDR the health care system focused mainly on the younger, working people. So older people had it harder compared to the west and profited the most from the new established western social care system.

the life expectancy in 1989 were two and a half year higher in the west, in 2000 it was about one year and in 2011 it was equal. together with an overall rise, east german women now live 6,3 years longer and east german men even 7,4 years.

Socio-economic: They are less likely to have health insurance due to being less likely to be middle class, and most southern states cut off state medical assistance (e.g., Medicaid) if you make more than a pittance each year.  This problem will get better due to Obamacare, but due to complex reasons (Republican states opting out of expanding Medicaid), it will persist in the South.

Cultural: Black people love fried food.  Look up ""soul food,"" and you will see that it is not exactly healthy.  Black people often have Scottish eating habits.

My studies on that, and keeping an active academic and personal interest on similar issues, led me to also cover many similar topics. 

1. It's hard to say if it is going to be beneficial in general for two reasons. First, we don't know what's in it, and second, beneficial is a very subjective term. Because of that, the most objective measure I can think of are quantifiable factors in which case I wrote a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clerlxy) about what some of the expected benefits of the TTIP are, based off of economic analyses by respected policy think tanks. You can determine for yourself if that's enough.

2. 'tread' is a strong word. It's important to understand that pretty much every ratified treaty impinges on the sovereignty of the ratifying countries, as by definition they limit the actions the government can take, and in return that government gets certain benefits. That said, when people write about concerns over sovereignty I think they're mostly referring to ISDS provisions and the fear that American companies are going to take over Europe. I've written about that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clervs2) and why it's a load of bullshit. It's fine to be against ISDS because of sovereignty concerns, and to oppose the TTIP on those grounds, but what I mostly object to is people completely misunderstanding and/or mischaracterizing how ISDS actually functions to create bogus fears about it. 

3. From what I've read, it all seems pretty standard. It's clearly a more comprehensive/ambitious FTA/Investment treaty than most, and there will always be winners and losers in such treaties, but over-all it doesn't seem to be egregiously against the public's interest.

false,silence_hr,CROA,Croatia,"These links are actually encouraging, these Roma have settled and there are voices from inside their community against these sorts of things.

It's hard to change cultural beliefs and it will take time, but there is progress. I actually think they will integrate sooner or later because they did choose to settle, build homes and want to improve their situation. The government is working with them, but they need to resolve some of these issues among themselves. They need to stop pulling their kids out of school for example. There have been improvements with education as well.

It's a two way street. They are poor and we should help them, but they also need to start doing more to stop the worst stuff from happening. 

Personally, I think more and more of their kids will want to go to school and finish school because the life they have and the life they could have are so vastly different that it will push them in the right direction. Everybody wants a good life and these Roma will probably change over a generation or two, mostly because they dropped their nomadic life and settled down. I think that's the most important thing here. As soon as you settle you start belonging somewhere and then it's easier for kids to finish school, find jobs and so on.

There are some Roma in Croatia who came long ago and are fully integrated in the society (I actually didn't even know that until we visited a Roma house on a trip and learned). 

Here is a story from Bjelovar county: http://robertinacuhnil.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/romi-lovari-izvorni-hrvatski-romi/

&gt;Goran Đurđević živi i djeluje u Bjelovaru, gdje su kao udruga prije 7 godina osnovali integrirani dječji vrtić za romsku i neromsku djecu. Kapacitet je 60-ero djece, a trenutno je u vrtiću 80-ero, a još je i oko 180 zainteresiranih. Cijena je 200 kuna, a zanimljivo je da je u vrtiću 70% neromske djece. Zašto je tomu tako? Svakako da je to povoljna cijena vrtića za građane koji su inače u Bjelovaru navikli plaćati i veću cijenu, ali nažalost određeni dio Roma nije spreman platiti vrtić, nego očekuje da se njima plati da im dijete ide u vrtić. Teško je utjecati na promjenu svijesti kod tog dijela Roma, čast izuzecima. „Ovakav vrtić je izvrsna priprema za osnovnu školu, nadalje se prati rad djece u OŠ, osiguravaju se stipendije za srednju i fakultet. Za samu stipendiju je potrebna preporuka romske zajednice i izjava kod javnog bilježnika da je učenik Rom. Iznos godišnje stipendije za srednju školu je 5 000 kuna, a za fakultet 10 000“, ističe gospodin Đurđević.

Roma in Bjelovar started integrated kindergarten and Croatian parents send their kids there without problems. This kindergarten helps Roma kids with elementary school.

These are Roma who came to Croatia in 14. century.

&gt;Još jedan vrijedan pokušaj Udruge izvornih Roma Lovara je osnivanje Prve romske zadruge koja bi zapošljavala Rome na održavanju prvog polja lavande u Bilogori, koje se nalazi na imanju Romske etno kuće u Maglenči u okolici Bjelovara.  Ovo je pilot projekt koji bi mogao poslužiti kao primjer i ostalim županijama. Prednost je što omogućava Romima, koji sami ne vole papirologiju da se bave poslovima koje vole i na koje su navikli, poput sakupljanja sekundarnih sirovina i slično, a da to bude legalno. Romska etno kuća je građena na tradicionalan način, a služi za prezentaciju romske tradicije i kulture. Ondje se mogu kušati specifična romska jela koje karakterizira bogatstvo okusa, a posebno je zastupljena ljutina, o kojoj će vam domaćini ispričati zanimljivu priču. Zapravo, pričanje zanimljivih priča o Romima i njihovoj kulturi u autohtonom ambijentu, uz pucketanje vatre u otvorenom kaminu, uz čašicu neke rakije s lavandom, recimo, odvest će vas direktno u neko drugo vrijeme i neki drugi svijet gdje sve brige današnjice barem na kratko izblijede. Ono što se Romima zamjera, ali i na čemu im se zavidi je sloboda i ležernost, a to se u Maglenči, na ovom imanju može doživjeti.

Another valuable initiative by Roma is ""Roma ethno house"" near Bjelovar where they work on lavander fields. I was actually in that house and it was pretty cool. We paid for tickets to enter Roma house .... and the guide told us about their history.

So, it's not all bad ..... those who want to integrate, can. And will.

It's a process in which they need to leave some of their culture and accept modern, civilized life. Then it will be better.

&gt; This time in Sloviansk according to exit polls: Opposition Bloc 28%, CPU 13%, Tyhipko 5% vs BPP 19%, PF 8%, Radicals 7%, Samopomich 5%, Batkyv 2%, Svoboda 2%. Overall 46% RU vs 43% UA. They still lead, but it's almost 50/50, nothing like the huge lead of 2012. So even in pro-RU strongholds results are like all-Ukrainian average before.

Es ist ein gewaltiger Unterschied ob jemand eine Pistole gut weggeschlossen hat oder ob er sie jederzeit Griffbereit hat - auch außerhalb der eigenen vier Wände.

Premièrement, miner un astéroïde qui passe suffisamment près de la terre pour être mis en orbite est suffisamment faible : c'est le prix d'une fusée pour pousser légèrement la cible sur une trajectoire acceptable, plus le coût de robots mineurs à poser dessus pour extraire et renvoyer les composants intéressants. Avec un investissement de recherche suffisant, c'est tout à fait faisable aujourd'hui, et très probablement faisable pour pas trop cher d'ici 40 ans ; le tout est d'avoir le fric et surtout une cible acceptable, et ça ce n'est pas donné. Une alternative que l'on va très probablement voir d'ici peu de temps, c'est l'exploitation des fonds sous-marins pour récupérer entre autres des terres rares, mais les astéroïdes sont l'étape suivante, surtout pour les éléments rares sur Terre.

Deuxièmement, la fusion nucléaire est tout à fait réalisable, et d'ailleurs elle existe déjà. Les problèmes ne sont pas dans la théorie, mais dans l'ingénierie. Ce genre de problème se résout très vite si, et seulement si, l'on lance une quantité phénoménale d'argent au problème sur un très court laps de temps. Exemple parfait : la course à la Lune dans les années 60. Contre-exemple parfait : la fusion nucléaire, dont les crédits de recherche opérationnelle ont été maintenus délibérément et perpétuellement au niveau ""peut-être d'ici 20 ans"" durant les 6 dernières décennies.

If they were trying to mediate I would 100% agree with you. However, they are stoking tensions, not trying to ease them. 

&gt;The US did invade or destabilise most countries that where prorussian or not really pro american all over the world.

If you look at my posting history, I will also agree with you. In the past the US did exactly what Russia is doing now, especially in South/Central America. But it seems to have learned trade is better than conflict. It is the number one destination for Venezuelan oil to be refined despite the openly anti-American leadership there. The Venezuelan state oil company owns one of the largest oil conglomerates in the US as well. Destabilization is not profitable for either Venezuela or the US. It seems Venezuela's own internal policies are pushing it toward the brink, no intervention necessary by the US. Also, there are very often Russian military assets and troops in South/Central America and Cuba. By that logic the US has every right to invade and annex portions of countries cooperating with Russia. 

Case in point is Vietnam. China acts exactly like Russia towards its neighbors. Recently the unthinkable happened. ASEAN, of which Vietnam is a powerful partner, invited the US to a summit on regional security. This had absolutely nothing to do with the US forcing Vietnam's hand. In fact it was the other way around. The US was acting with caution because of the tensions in the region. Also, Vietnam is one of the only countries outside Russia's ""sphere"" hosting a Russian military base. So it could be said it is Russia aligned, but it is clearly still concerned about Chinese aggression in its neighborhood.  What prompted the invite was when the US China acting aggressively while everyone was side tracked with Crimea. 

The Philippines requested additional US troops stationed there also because of China's aggression. It is certainly not the case that the US always muscles its way in. In fact, it is typically invited. See Baltics, Philippines, Japan, SK, etc. I will be the first to say, the US acted the same way Russia is now in the past. But if you look at recent history, it seems to value trade more than military engagement.

&gt;You are kidding, right? Do you not know that thanks to our history of industrial-scale slavery and our more recent history of institutionalized racism and crappy social policies, we have an impoverished black underclass with rates of violence and other criminality that make Roma look like fucking angels.
   
   
Well first of, you're comparing (poor) black (criminals) people to (criminal) roma. Which is kind of rude. Secondly, if you would provide free education, housing and other free shit (maybe change a gun law or two but that might be a stretch), you could solve the ghetto problem in a few decades. But believe me, here in Europe we've tried with roma, to no avail.

What I was trying to convey with the unfair trial thing is that roma can really manage to unite the worst enemies. (I'm not going to start about how blacks already are getting unfair trials. And yes I know there's no country-wide support for that. Rightfully so etc. etc.). You don't think we dislike them (just the unbehaving ones obvi) for no reason do you?

It's not like I want ""*all the evil roma sub-humans that are so much worse than us*""(putting words in your mouth now) not on the same buses. It's that a large group of roma are terrorizing (yes I used that word) a bus line. If there weren't any criminal roma; great, all aboard I'd say. Even the roma now that aren't criminal can come aboard. It's not like they're doing blood tests. If the impoverished roma would wash their face, comb their hair and put on clean clothes you couldn't even tell the difference between them and non-roma. (not joking) But they often don't do that.

As I said, I fully understand people in that Italian town because I have dealt with such Roma. They just want to use the damn bus in peace.

When I was in the army there were few Roma guys, they did stick together, but I heard how they live. One guy was 19, had 3 kids and they allowed him to go to take care for a sick kid because without him no one was able to provide for the kid. Mother didn't work and the guy made money selling potatoes .... they were poor, but he never complained when given a task and wanted to work.

Early marriages are a big problem for them. I can't imagine having 3 kids at the age of 19. I have 2 now that I am 40. It's a multitude of factors that is keeping them in poverty, but as soon as they decide to change their cultural stances they can prosper.

This link (I already shared it) is about some of Roma girls who talk about Roma life: http://danas.net.hr/hrvatska/otac-me-je-zelio-prodati-za-gajbu-piva

Yes, one had a father who wanted to sell her for a box of beer into arranged marriage, but she refused and finished school. She left that life.

""I am Roma, but I would never live in Roma settlement again. I don't even go there anymore, some despise me, my parents are cold to me. They want my help now.""

This is prime example of what Roma need to change. Those who want to integrate, can.

There are no consequences, other than just a natural market process of the weak and dumb companies going bust, and rightfully minded companies gaining the market share of the bankrupt ones; they'll happily feast on their carcass.

With those bailouts, they just showed that there's no reward for the banks that ran their business properly. Instead, it showed that you can fuck up big time and walk out of it like it hasn't happen. Already people are not giving 2 fucks about it. It's been 7 years and its the same climate like pre-08. It's just that regular clients are more weary of taking loans and some banks are weary of lending to risky clients.

Other than that, govts are still indebting themselfes, banks are still allowed to run both investment and traditional banking under the same roof. 

It won't be long before another bubble bursts because of the housing, stock, and heck even commodities overpricing, compared to average customers' purchasing power. If you're an average person, you have to work decades to be able to afford housing for your family?

If you're rich, you buy dozens of properties, but you can barely find people to stay because of how high rents are in some places. How do you even expect someone to pay 700$/month or more when their wage is like 1000 something $?

It's a desynchronized market, and sooner or later the pieces will get scrambled again.

Exactly!

I really can't be certain without going into more detail as to why particular excesses weren't addressed, but I assume the problem is political correctness.

Why not be truly politically correct, instead of putting up a a facade of political correctness, and treat Rome like everyone else?

They're loud — throw them off the bus. They smell — throw them off the bus. They don't pay tickets — fine them and throw them of the bus. They spit on people — throw them off the bus, prosecute them for physical attack and fine them.

By avoiding to do this in the name of political correctness, fearing you will be labeled as anti-Roma/whatever, you're just creating this image of them being above the law and being able to do whatever the hell they want, and the resentment towards them grows, just like their behavior becomes worse.

false,jeremyjc,null,null,"With the studentenwerk it is literally a room with a sleeping bag (and other furniture). Your room will have the following:

* A sleeping bag (+pillow)

* A closet

* A bed frame (with foam mattress)

* A desk

* A Bookshelf

I think the sleeping bag really exists to get you by for the first 3-4 days, or until you can buy some cheap bedding.

What I'd be more worried about with the studentwerk is how hard it is to get housing. August-September might not be bad since students are out, but if you want to have a room during the school year you're going to be on a waiting list for a while (unless you get lucky).

Rent is usually 250-350 euro, depending on where you are and the size/niceness of room.",0,1414361628,null,0,false,0,clkk97h,t3_2kdo5l,t1_clkk97h,t3_2kdo5l,null,1426337309,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3
