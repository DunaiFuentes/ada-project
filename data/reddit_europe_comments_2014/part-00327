Do you mean to imply Russia would use this to justify a invasion of NATO countries?

In which case no, I'd say they couldn't. Russia isn't stupid. They'll start a war with Ukraine, but they would hesitate &amp; think for a very long time before committing any action against a NATO member-state. America would beat them decisively in a conventional war.

The only hope Russia could ever have of gaining NATO territory is if they launched a lightening assault on the Baltics, dug-in, and kept it limited to the Baltics by forcing a stalemate with tactical nukes before NATO could really mobilize, with the very real threat of escalating to ICBMs. 

But that's all but impossible. America has the largest reserves of expeditionary forces &amp; the most efficient means of power projection in the world, so any Russian offensive would result in a immediate American response which would completely fuck up any chance of it being a quick or limited conflict. American tactical nukes in theatre, especially in both Germany &amp; your own country, also give Russia pause to think before using tactical nukes.

Same reason Chinese military doctrine is now focusing on power projection directed towards limited, short &amp; decisive wars, because they too can't hope to compete with America &amp; it's allies conventionally in the Pacific. I also wouldn't be surprised if Vietnam became their Ukraine.

A more interesting question is countries like Finland, ones whom are in the EU, but not NATO. But even though I don't think we *(America)* would hesitate to get involved and defend them as to not would risk our relationship &amp; influence way to much with the other NATO members in the EU.

I was a bit uncomfortable with the version of classicfighter, it sounded a bit stiff to me, but it was very close to the original text.
My version is translated a little bit more freely, in order to make it sound more smoothely. But after all, i still went with the original, so it's not a completely different text or something like that... ;-)

I might improve/correct it, if you want to. (Fun Fact: At first i was not sure whether you're speaking of you're woman or your daughter. Please correct me, if it is actually your daughter - even though I'm quite sure she's not! ;-) )

If you have any questions regarding some parts of my translation, please feel free to ask them right away! I just registered only for this, so I'd be glad to help you doing it just the way you want to have it! (But please let me take a nap first - it's almost 4 am here in germany and i just wanted to sleep when i saw your post! ;-) )

PS: The last part of the last sentence was a little tricky. (""...all that I feel you give to my life."")

How were *we* the punk? lmao The situation in Ukraine was in good part created by Europe by waving the potential of EU membership in the Ukranian people's face, but when shit hit the fan, the EU pussied the fuck out, abandoned the Ukrainian people &amp; left the burden to America until we could rally you guys back to the defensive.

You'll be the one incinerated. Dead in minutes before you even know what the fuck happened. I'll be the one who dies a slow, painful &amp; lingering death as my body slowly disintegrates from radiation poisoning; first my hair will fall-out, then my teeth &amp; then the slow sickful death with blood leaking out of my orifices. 

And yes, let me tell you how much I relish this. A weak Europe constantly dependent on American hard power to maintain the status quo when the world is shifting to Asia &amp; China is our most important rival. A Europe incapable of agreeing on a common foreign policy or integrating militarily, one who can't implement a proper currency union with the proper underlying fiscal union nor one capable of even deciding if it want's to be a supranational entity or a intergovernmental organization. 

So yes, that's what I want. A divided, weak Europe that's under constant Russian threat &amp; incapable of responding to regional security concerns, thus making them more dependent on my country and forcing both our resources &amp; focus away from Asia and back to Europe.

This shit might've been a benefit in the last century when the world revolved around Europe &amp; the Soviet Union was our greatest rival, but it's not the Cold War anymore. The world revolves around Asia now, and China is our greatest rival. The fact we're still there, the fact we're willing to risk thermonuclear warfare for small regions like the Baltics and for the ideals of European integration, should ring true to how good allies we are. 

But on that note, let's not forget about the last century. Where our intervention in WWII prevented the Iron Curtain extending to the Channel, where our garrisoning of the Fulda Gap deterred the Soviets from annexing Western Europe, where the Marshall Plan helped speed up the post-war recovery of Europe &amp; where America's contribution to NATO *(combined with all the other shit)* helped provide the stability &amp; foundation needed for Pan-European integration to really take off. 

An fuck Maliki. He wanted American soldiers to remain under the condition they be subject to Iraqi courts, the same ones he had a hand in corrupting &amp; increasing sectarian strife in, so he can suck my American balls for that. 

American troops will remain, thankfully, in Afghanistan however. And it's *because of* American hard-power that China isn't going to make a move on Japan, Korea or the Philippines. Our commitments to those countries have been made quite clear in the past couple years, and it's obvious from our recent *""Pivot to the Pacific""* that we're serous about them, else we wouldn't be moving 60% of both our Air Force &amp; Navy into the region.

Interesting question. What I realized earlier today, or perhaps it was yesterday, it crossed my mind that some Europeans, notably Germans, British and Dutch people, are vulnerable to intellectual flattery, that is, if you reinforce their arrogant superiority feelings, they will ""thank you"" by believing your information instead of the more mundane mainstream explanation. You are targeting left-wing non-interventionists who already have a strong (and oftentimes justified) mistrust of their own authorities.

Also, the Netherlands and Ukraine are making the same critical mistakes the U.S. made after 9/11: arrogantly dismissing public concern and questions arising because ""you don't need to respond to silly conspiracy theorists"".

Yes you do. You need to constantly, relentlessly pound your audience with facts (Do not use ""true lies"", ever, just the facts), if they fund a ""documentary"" where they fire a board cannon at a passenger plane hull, then finance your own antidote experiment. Start a wiki debunking Russian myths, and be as open and transparent about your findings as possible.

Just two years before the EU parliament was warning Ukraine not to make coalitions with svoboda, then you had them in government.

I don't know about having to flee - footage from Mezhygorye showed that he started packing since Thursday, when govt forces still were firmly in control and were busy shooting the crowd. His absence on Sat morning came as a complete surprise to most people after Friday's ceasefire (so to say). As for impeachment - it's tricky since there's just no provision for president simply going missing. AFAIR, his impeachment was legal under 2004 constitution which was rolled back into place as part of the agreement, but which he did not actually sign... A mess, sure. Given the circumstances, the transition was handled pretty well, in my personal opinion.

Parliament was the only legitimate source of power at the time (in the  absence of the president and the whole cabinet) so disbanding it then wouldn't have brought much of a benefit, to put it lightly. Also, calling early elections is permissible only in specific scenarios, one of which was executed by the president in August. Svoboda took part in the new coalition (and forming the government) because there was no one else. A post-Maidan coalition government with Party of Regions or Communist fractions probably wouldn't have survived a single day in the office after what happened just mere days before. 

And the language ""attack"" issue is so fucking old and tired by now... Parliament, not government. The motion was not signed, it was to go back to Soviet-time law, not to ban Russian language. Also, to give some context, this happened on Sunday, next day after Yanukovich fled and remnants of the parliament were busy installing some semblance of temporary order and rolling back the worst of the old legislation.

* ""Scheiße"" is used very similarly to ""shit"". Maybe a bit less often. You can also form compounds: ""Scheißarbeit"" (I really hate that work), etc. Contrary to popular American belief, ""Scheißkopf"" isn't a valid insult.

* ""Höllehallen"" again sounds strange, too long for a swear word. I'd just use ""Höllen!"" or ""Alle Höllen!"" (Hells!, All Hells!) or something like that for the polytheistic feel.

* ""Links um"" is a common military command used during drills. It wouldn't be used as a swear word.

* ""Bis bald"" is frequently used for friends and acquintances. It's informal, you wouldn't use it in a formal setting (e.g. with your boss), even though you know the name of your boss very well. So it depends on the formality of the situation.

German is as creative in creating swear words as any other language is. If you can give a few more details about the background and the kind of society you are describing (""polytheistic"" is a bit vague), we could come up with a few more examples.

I claimed that from a post-nationalist perspective disallowing freedom of movement between areas is arbitrary. 

The commenter below said that even from a post-nationalist perspective open borders are bad because the extra poor people put too much of a strain to an advanced economy's welfare state. 

My reply meant to show that if the policy objective is to reduce strain on the welfare state, then an equally good way to reduce it is to deport poor people. Arriving at this absurd conclusion puts into question the whole idea of""strained welfare system =&gt; send some people away"". Therefore proving that a postnationalist would not support prohibitive immigration policies to reduce strain on welfare systems because if he wanted to remain consistent he would also have to support absurd policies like the one I mentioned above. 

To see why the principle in both policies is the same is simple: For a postnationalist, there is no difference between already existing poor people crippling the welfare state and new arrivals poor people crippling the welfare state.

No, I'm saying there is no great pressure to change the system as it is, and pointing out flaws in the solutions so far proposed.

&gt; Plenty of companies in the broadly defined ""Industry"" need three shifts

They do, and shift work is very unpopular. Nobody wants to have to work at 2 am, but they have to. Studies have shown that shift work is positively detrimental to health.

&gt; The extra expense of paying someone 150% wages is laughable

Some businesses can well afford it. Many can't, however, especially the smaller ones with twenty employees. Not only do they have to pay their existing staff extra, they have to take on extra staff as well, and that would finish off a small business.

&gt; when you consider what a holiday truly is for a large company - reduced capacity

If we're talking about a big industry that can't shut down its processes, as you say, these businesses do work constantly, weekends and holidays included.

Reduced capacity isn't automatically a problem, though. It depends what you're making and how fast you can sell them. There's no point in churning out vast quantities of whatever product you're making if there's not the demand for them. It's a complicated business, but what generally happens in some industry sectors is that they go through periods where they're working flat out seven days a week, and other periods where they have to impose a three-day week.

However, if we're talking about grocery stores, it's a bogus argument because people don't buy stuff just because the stores are open, so they won't buy more stuff just because they're open longer hours. This was the experience of stores everywhere when they were allowed to stay open until 8 pm: initially, large numbers of them reverted to a 6 pm closing time. It's slowly gone back to 8 pm in most cases, but the most beneficial effect really has been that the evening rush has been slightly spread out.

&gt; who does pay for all of this in the end? Not the shareholders, never.

No, but the shareholders will want to see increased profits and decreased costs. If they don't get that, they will apply pressure to make sure they do.

&gt;  in the end it's solely the customers or taxpayers that pay for it.

Certainly, it has to be paid for, yes. I don't know about taxpayers, but if you're right, that's a double whammy: increased prices *and* increased taxes. Actually, I would expect that if hiring staff reduces the number of people on benefits and increases the number of people earning taxable income, then the taxpayer would actually benefit slightly; but the store would still have increased overheads, and that increased cost still has to be passed on.

&gt; Those privileges are a luxury of rich countries

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Germany *is* a rich country.

Unless by ""privileges"" you mean ""longer store opening times"". I disagree. I don't think there's any need for them, and I think that expecting people to work inconvenient and anti-social hours just for the convenience of a few people with a sense of entitlement is to misunderstand what a ""privilege"" is.",0,1414916124,null,0,false,0,clqnp5p,t3_2kyq5s,t1_clqnp5p,t1_clqaiqy,null,1426231898,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

[Kuznetsov NK-12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznetsov_NK-12) engines, the most powerful ever, with 12,000 hp each. A turboprop engine is basically a jet engine wherein the jet, instead of being ejected through a reaction nozzle to push the engine forward, drives a last turbine stage which in turn drives a propeller. They are common in military transports and commuter planes, because they are more efficient than jet engines. And they may yet make a comeback to larger airliners in the guise of the propfan.

The main drawback of the turboprop is that, at higher speeds, the propeller tips go supersonic, making these engines less efficient and **much more noisy**.

Nevertheless, the Tu-95 is about as fast as a modern airliner and, thanks to its turboprop engines, has a very long range and endurance. Which is all you need for a plane which is nowadays used either as a long-range maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, or as a platform from which to launch cruise missiles from a safe distance to their target.

To penetrate hostile air defences, the Russians have other, jet-powered, supersonic bombers, anyway...

EDIT: Because their turboprops have more low-speed thrust than jet engines, Tu-95 pilots have a special party trick they like to pull on NATO fighters: first, they cruise at very low speed, so slowly that the fighters have trouble not stalling. Then, they suddenly push the throttle forward and leave the fighters standing. Because jet engines have significantly less thrust at low speeds, it takes a while until the fighters can accelerate and catch up with the propeller-powered museum piece. Tu-95 pilots had particular fun doing this to RAF Tornado ADVs, which, in their initial versions, were woefully underpowered. Rumour has it that the RAF fighters had to light up their afterburners to catch up with the Tu-95s before they were back in Murmansk...",0,1414917055,null,0,1414918769,0,clqnuwj,t3_2l0nyf,t1_clqnuwj,t1_clqfz15,null,1426231824,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

In my opinion, corruption has caused this to happen. People are too fed up with corruption and stealing being the mainstream in politics while so many people are unemployed or their subsidies taken from them. It makes the blood in your veins boil when you hear that those guys are filling their pockets with black money while some kid is skipping breakfast because his parents cannot afford it. Some years ago people had nowhere to go because there were only 2 parties (spanish electoral system favors big parties) Now things have changed a lot. 

Even though I think Podemos is absolutely clueless about economic policy, removing the political ""casta"" is a necessary step towards a healthy corruption-free country. The only way a country can grow  is when its leaders do not systematically steal from the population. We can only hope they don't turn into what they were born to eradicate.

Was mich zum einen ankotzt ist der Vergleich von Klauen und Piraterie. Wenn ich einen Film oder Stream runterlade ohne zu zahlen, dann fehlt niemandem etwas. Es ist eine Kopie. Ich klaue kein Original. Ich klaue gar nichts. Die Content-Mafia (eigentlich ein besserer Name dafür) probiert gerne beides zu vermischen. In ihrem Lobby-Kampf für eine Kriminalisierung von Privat-Kopierern. Mal schnell ein Backup der eigenen DVD? In Deutschland nicht erlaubt. Und wenn es nach der Content-Mafia geht auch bald kriminell.

Das andere sind die unglaublichen Hürden um legal Content konsumieren ""zu dürfen"". Auch hier hinkt der Vergleich mit der Supermarkt-Kasse gewaltig. Denn wenn ich zur Videothek trabe, dann zahle ich pro Film €1 pro Tag. Wenn ich gemütlich zu Hause bleiben will, dann zahle ich pro Film oft das Doppelte oder Dreifache. Zumal die Filme erst in die Videothek und Wochen später zum legalen Download zu haben sind. 

Nur dass die Bequemlichkeit doppelt gilt. Für die Industrie ist der Betrieb von ein paar Servern um mehrere Größenordnung günstiger als die Miete für eine Videothek plus das Erstellen von DVDs plus die Anlieferung plus das Gehalt von dem Typen der in der Videothek arbeitet. 

Warum ist die Videothek günstiger und aktueller? Weil die Content-Mafia ihre Kunden gerne gängelt. Wenn es online die Filme für €1 pro Tag gäbe, wie in der Videothek, dann würden sie trotzdem viel mehr Gewinn machen als mit einem Verleih aus dem Laden. Pro Film. Warum wollen sie keinen Gewinn machen? Weil sie einfach gerne Kunden verarschen. Es handelt sich eben nicht um eine Firma, sondern um eine Mafia. Es geht denen nicht um's Geld. Es geht um Macht.

Warum man sich für den Namen entschied weiß ich nicht, aber ich kann mir vorstellen, dass der Name damals positive Konnotationen bei den Arbeitern gehabt haben könnte und man sich erhoffte dadurch ein weiteres Spektrum von Wählern zu erreichen.

The proposed budget for 2015 includes €9,809,803 for the Grand-ducal family, which is an increase of €397,226. This is not perceived positively in the population who feels that the new government is leading politics of austerity. 
* **The government introduced a new saving fund.**

NGOs have been requested this for years.

One of them has been sentenced to 6month of prison, the other to 1year of prison, but both on parole. Additionally, they are sentenced to a fine of 850€. This is the second time people are being sentenced over comments on Facebook after 4 people have been condemned guilty of racist comments a couple of years ago.

All relevant business will be lead from Brussels in the future starting end of 2015. The minister of foreign affairs of Luxembourg, Jean Asselborn (LSAP/S&amp;D) said that this will not change the excellent relations between Luxembourg and Finland.

No official statement has been made from the police yet. Media has been stoking fear about these terror clowns in the last weeks.

The rise of 6.5% is equivalent to 8,000 kids. However, Luxembourg is ranked 4th internationally on education and employment. Unemployment for youth aged 15-24 fell from 6.2% to 5%.  
* **Man arrested over movie pirating**.

Whereas the topic of software and movie pirating has never really been on the political agenda and our minister of economic affairs even publicly said that there would be no sanctions on downloads (he said this while ACTA was being central in media reports), this is the first time someone has been arrested for recording a movie in cinema.

The thing was that this notorious corruption was not punished because Spain was working well, with jobs and good expectancy of live thanks to the bubble of construction and from tourism.

The second factor is media . Pablo iglesias started like a collaborator for politics shows in TV in a slightly left channel arguing with politicians and others collaborators from the two main Party.
So for first time a lot of people which only way of information is TV were hearing the problems of corruption and realizing that this is a big issue and one of the main reason spain is so fucked up. And that means a lot of share. So more channels were interested on him and he became very famous
Pablo then founded PODEMOS and he started to convince people but for a while many were reticent because his socialistic ways and afraid of his economics ideas. But corruption is still a thing.

He was living in New York city when the war broke out, making a new life a long way from that old town and he didn't join up as soon as war broke out in Europe, but when America entered the war he decided to travel to Canada to fight for the Empire rather than his new homeland. He served for 18 months until he was wounded by a shell in October 1918, less than a month before the end of the war. He was taken to a field hospital but died from his wounds. The boy who was born in that small town who grew up to leave for a new life in America, was killed by a German, whilst fighting for Canada in Belgium and ended up buried back in that same small town less than a mile from where he was born.

Millions of families have similar stories, lives snuffed out, dreams and potential wasted. They could have done great things, they could have done terrible things, they could have lived entirely unremarkable lives but in the end no one will ever know because they died in their thousands in a war against other men and boys not unlike themselves.

In the meantime, the mainstream parties, in which there is little internal democracy, have slowly filled with careerists, and even outright bandits. While the going was good, nobody took much notice, but when the crisis has struck, this whole edifice has come tumbling down.

As the money has dried up, mouths have opened up, and a great many corruption scandals, involving all established parties, have exploded. In the latest one, this week, more than 50 people have been arrested, including leading local politicians from both right and left. What has made this latest case particularly infuriating is that it involves public spending in the last couple of years, when spending cuts were already in full swing.

At the same time, the lack of young talent in the main parties has become farcical. There has also been a particularly ridiculous case last month in which a teenage mythomaniac, after babbling his way into the high spheres of the government party, and having his picture taken in all sorts of public functions (including the new King's coronation), leveraged his apparent influence by soliciting bribes from several companies. He was caught, but not before he spent a lot of money of unknown provenance with a ""Wolf of Wall Street"" lifestyle.

Thing is, because of Spain's electoral system, all of this didn't matter much, as long as no alternative party managed to reach a critical mass. Now Podemos seems to have reached this critical mass, which could strengthen it quite quickly, as people see that they may actually win elections.

Personally, I think it's a pity, because for all its indignation, Podemos doesn't really offer solutions to Spain's problems. They just promise all things to all people. Its economic program is a mess, by their own admission, and as for rooting out corruption they don't go beyond ""we are clean, they are dirty"". If anything, their super-statist instincts would put even more discretionary power in the hands of politicians, leading to *more* corruption, not less.

But of course, the mainstream parties are in a difficult position to argue that they would do any better economically or against corruption, and their cadres are fossilized and completely out-of-touch. The pity is that the centrist alternative parties which, in my opinion, have much better proposals to improve the economy and root out corruption, are riven with infighting and running out of puff before reaching any sort of critical mass.",0,1414924113,null,0,false,0,clqoz5l,t3_2l1e3r,t1_clqoz5l,t3_2l1e3r,null,1426231302,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It's as if they've dumbed down the propaganda and stripped away any pretense of morality, of building a better society. Just us-vs-them nonsense. 

As the political climate in America is not particularly pro-interventionist at the moment, and the Fox News viewers seem more scared of Ebola and Isis than they ever were of the Russia-Ukraine situation; implying that Obama is driving this whole thing seems intentionally misleading. If you replaced Obama with the leaders of countries like Poland or Estonia, you wouldn't have Putin putting a bully in his place, you'd have Putin being the bully. Having Putin fighting European leaders (or even a vague ""west"") would not only not be powerful enough, it may cause Russians to question their country's role in this conflict. 

So I think the oversimplification (and use of specific politicians rather than symbols) is due to the fact that a very specific narrative needs to be pounded into people's heads in order for them to stay on side.

Everything is designed so that people see China and Russia unfavourably and the US favourably with a bit of ""US criticism"" and ""Eastern Candy"" mixed in to make the deluded masses believe that the reporting in the US is totally fair and balanced.

As an Aussie, I've never seen anyone take issue with this. It depends on the cultural context, I think. Blackface is acceptable in the Netherlands because they have a cultural history of it being acceptable. In the US, it's not because they have a cultural history of it being extremely racist. We actually ran into this problem in Australia on a TV show called 'Hey hey it's Saturday', where a long-standing comedy skit involved blackface, and only when we had an American guest appearance (Harry Connick-Junior) did it suddenly become an issue.

That said, I think there is considerably more background racism in Europe than in Australia. People with foreign sounding names are consistently less likely to get jobs than the traditional natives. I once heard a Swedish girl in one of my Masters classes (who I'd always seen as the typical kind of non-racist, progressive voice) say in all seriousness that she'd always hire a Swede over a foreigner because she just knew they'd be better and she didn't want to deal with foreigners.

No, not really. The only difference is that in the US the population has been successfully and completely deluded to the point where they join the propaganda-train.

The consequences are the same.

&gt; But AFAIK currently there is no state owned propaganda channels conducted by the United States Administration.

Like I said to the person whose side you took, you seem to be very confused about an important thing: The US government is the thing being owned by corporations, not the other way around.

Everything. I mean, seriously, you people ask for examples of US propaganda? What is coming out of that country that ISN'T propaganda? Americans themselves are *raised* to be deluded about their own country. Many of them pledge allegiance to their national flag when they are children. I seriously can't comprehend you people.

Could you give me an example of Russian propaganda? Because I'm almost sure I can immediately show you an example of American propaganda that's even worse.

&gt;

&gt;__Muphry's law__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""If you write anything criticizing [editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_editing) or [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading), there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written.""  The name is a deliberate misspelling of [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law).

&gt;Similar laws have also been coined, usually in the context of online communication, under names including __Skitt's Law__,  __Hartman's Law of Prescriptivist Retaliation__ (or The Law of Prescriptive Retaliation),  __The Iron Law of Nitpicking,__   and __[McKean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McKean)'s Law__.  Further variations state that flaws in a printed or published work will only be discovered after it is printed and not during proofreading,  and flaws such as spelling errors in a sent email will be discovered by the sender only during rereading from the ""Sent"" box.

&gt; Xenophobia (a form of discrimination) is the unreasoned fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange. It comes from the Greek words ξένος (xenos), meaning ""strange"", ""foreigner"", and φόβος (phobos), meaning ""fear"". Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity. Xenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an ""uncritical exaltation of another culture"" in which a culture is ascribed ""an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality.

It's not necessary for the target to be geographically foreign, as it just requires an arbitrarily defined ingroup (""*us*"") and outgroup (""*them*""). By saying ""I hate gypsies"", and referring to ""their behaviour"", you are extrapolating the attributes of a subgroup to a whole ethnic collective, which is [stereotyping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype#Content) by definition.

You could just as easily say ""I hate people who steal/beg aggressively/whatever stereotype you are associating to gypsies"", without generalising, and by that you wouldn't be misjudging the many gypsies who don't fall into that stereotype (which is the essential problem with xenophobia).",0,1414929584,null,0,false,0,clqpv71,t3_2l20fh,t1_clqpv71,t1_clqpkeb,null,1426230887,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

-----------------------

* Pretty much everything the US media publishes?
* Pretty much every Hollywood movie? 
* Every ad of the US army?
* Every article concerning itself with whistle blowers?

Pretty much everything you hear in US media about China and Russia? Everything Americans heard about the situation in Ukraine?

The reddit frontpage? The US government literally uses software to influence public media, including votes on reddit.

Everything is designed so that people see China and Russia unfavorably and the US favorably with a bit of ""US criticism"" and ""Eastern Candy"" mixed in to make the deluded masses believe that the reporting in the US is totally fair and balanced. After all, the press is free, right? (If you consider over 90% of all media being owned by 6 corporations ""free"". ;)""

You see, the first thing I try to look at is what is the counter opposite? And I can't find any. In a way, you are right. So the statement you used is ""Propaganda is worse in the US"".  

---------------------------

I'll first say the things I do not agree with.

I can't view Hollywood as propaganda for a start, why not? Simply because its individual and intellect property. And I think we all agree, Russians make the coolest mobsters but that's beside the point. 

When I hear or see the word propaganda I make a underlining difference that others might not make. And that is the right to intellectual freedom. If I make a movie about some Russian dope dealer is that considered propaganda? If I march outside with a sign reading ""I hate Russia"" is that considered propaganda? I do not view it as such.

When it comes to whistle blowers I completely agree. I think its disgusting how they portray them and US army ads, of course. But that's the same in every nation. 

Now, the US media. This is probably the biggest section. Now, don't get me wrong and I apologize in advance if I assume wrong. But I think the fundamental question you have to ask yourself is ""Did the US media always portray Russia as unfavorably?"" And the answer is NO in my opinion. And I think this is were our differences lie. You see, remember back in 06 - 07? I remember our media being flooded about how great a nation Russia had become. Remember that declaration of friendship between Bush and Putin. And to this day it still irks me to see that the Russian administration has turned a bit sour because I'm not gonna lie. I really did like Putin at first.

But, is the unfavorable view of Russia not an outcome instead of a calculation I have to ask myself? I think we can both agree that in 06 - 07 the western media reported about Russia favorably. So what happened? Is it not the action by the Russian administration that doomed itself rather then the US media deliberately trying to destroy the Russian governments image. I also do not view western or US media as en entire entity. Meaning that if you watch FOX news you get a complete different view then for example CNN or BBC. Not only that, negative views drive ratings up. A headline stating ""RAF INTERCEPTED RUSSIAN BOMBERS IN AIRSPACE"" will create more revenue. And my question is, is that also propaganda or not? Is every unfavorably view of Russia propaganda or can their not be legitimate concerns or negatieve view? I don't necessarily believe that negatieve news is propaganda. It can and could be. But I don't think it gets defined by it. Of course I'm not speaking of the US Admin / Gov.

Take its recent's turmoils with Crimea. I mean seriously? That was a stupid move. While I don't always agree with revolutions, and I actually might agree with its annexation. It was a PR disaster. So who is to blame for this? The Russian administration that send a military force to the region and then denying it while there was enough proof that there were in fact Russian soldiers. So I'm just asking questions because like I stated earlier I'm not educated on the matter.

From my point of view, Russia currently is not running a **progressive** agenda. And I really miss that. And I think that agenda is also defining how the western media looks at Russia. The west has this sense of superiority when it comes to these things. Legalization of drugs, LGBT more libertarianism. Same goes with these airspace interceptions done by the RAF and recently Portugal. Why does Putin feel the need to flex his muscles? To me, personally and this is pure opinion. Russia and the US is running a ""eye for an eye"". But isn't this exactly what Russia shouldn't do? 

Every nation will defend its own interest. And the US and Russia both share Anti-LGBT Propaganda whether its from its own citizens or politicians.

In the end, when I read through it all. I will **agree** with you on the fact that the US has indeed *more* propaganda and the links you gave me were actually quite shocking. And I won't dispute them. 

 So I'm gonna ask a couple of questions if that's alright for you. 

* Is US propaganda an outcome or a deliberate set? Meaning that the US media and government is tied in a calculation rather then a response to what Russia does? For example, Chinese propaganda -&gt; What do we do? 
* Is there a direct correlation between economic and military rise or fall when it comes to propaganda? Meaning that, is it not normal that a superpower has propaganda? 

* Was the beginning of US propaganda against Russia an reaction to the USSR's propaganda? Or was it deliberately tied against the USSR from the start. Or had the US always had a unfavorably view of Russia?

And my last question to you is. Will propaganda ever cease to exist?
What do we do? Or what can we do?

-&gt; I apologize I dismissed you so fast I shouldn't have done that.

EDIT: Spelling

EDIT: Is propaganda in general an effective way of changing a view of a nation? Can propaganda not be used for good purposes as well? For example -&gt; Pushing an progressive agenda.

Look at the Pew results polling Turkish attitudes towards different countries, nations, and organisations in different years: http://www.pewglobal.org/question-search/?keywordtext=favorable&amp;btnSubmit=Search&amp;topic=&amp;startdate=&amp;enddate=&amp;chkCntStndr224=on&amp;txtAreaCntIDsStndr=%40224-&amp;txtAreaStdIDs=

During last few years Turks have disliked every foreign country or organisation they have been asked about: the EU, the UN, Iran, USA, China, Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, NATO, Pakistan, South Korea, Egypt, India, Israel, Americans, Chinese...

But it wasn't always so. Something happened around 2006-7 and after.

According to the results (latest year):  
EU (2013) was liked before but disliked since 2007  
UN (2013) was liked before but disliked since 2006  
Iran (2014) was liked before but disliked since 2006  
USA (2014) always disliked but even more since 2006-2007  
China (2014) always disliked but even more since 2006-2007   
France (2013) always disliked but even more since 2006  
Saudi Arabia (2013) was liked in 2007 but disliked after that  
Russia (2014) always disliked but only asked since 2007  
Pakistan (2012) always disliked but only asked since 2008  
NATO (2013) always disliked but only asked since 2011  
Egypt (2007) disliked but the only year asked  
India (2008) disliked but the only year asked  
South Korea (2008) disliked but the only year asked  
Israel (2013) disliked but the only year asked  
Brazil (2014) disliked but the only year asked  

They did still like Japan a bit in 2008 and Germany a tiny bit in 2006 but both with negative trends and as those are the last years the countries were included cannot say how it went after that.

false,MaskedElevatorMan,,Expat,"&gt; It seems reasonable on the face of it, but in practice it won't work.

&gt; It's simply not feasible.

Your words.

You're dismissing the large problems with the current system and over-blowing minor issues such as management. For instance, worker capacity is a major problem for German enterprises because of very high labor costs. You're also ignoring the numerous other ways other countries go about doing things. 

For example, in Poland, during a public holiday, only the owner of a store is allowed to work. Which is a blessing for small stores. 

The fact is, the current system does cost the German economy quite a lot, and simply accepting it ""because it's been like this"" is not an excuse. People DO go shopping just because the stores are open. In some places, they flock on Sundays to big malls, drink coffee and buy stuff. Just because you reject this culture doesn't mean it's not good for the economy. Then there is reduced capacity of the enterprise. That's why closing everything on Sundays is a luxury.

Whether or not there is pressure to change it is another thing. The system might be wrong and still have no pressure for change. 

For example, is it right that we're all working mostly 8-17? Certainly not, and you'll find many examples of large corporations going away from this model, reducing traffic jams in large cities, thus saving the workers a considerable amount of time. And is there something more precious than the time of our lives? You might argue that there's no pressure to change things, but it still doesn't mean we should necessarily accept things as they are. 

&gt; Some businesses can well afford it. Many can't, however, especially the smaller ones with twenty employees. Not only do they have to pay their existing staff extra, they have to take on extra staff as well, and that would finish off a small business.

Small companies also tend to be a bit lax with labor laws. Sometimes people need to work 70hrs a week, or the company might fail. Some positions are understaffed and there are people who work 5 years without taking a holiday. There are also many people who simply don't count how many hours they've worked. I've been working in several small companies in the last 15 years and I've seen a fair share of misery at times.

That's a pretty broad word. 

In my experience casual racism is much more common in Europe while institutionalized racism is more common in the US. You may not be stopped by police for being black in Europe but you better believe I heard people saying things all the time in everyday conversation that would get them their ass beat here in the states.  

And no, calling someone ""black"" here in the US is not racist unless you're talking to some Tumblr SJW type. 


Also, how many votes did Golden Dawn get in Greece? How many neo-nazis across Europe, even in Germany? The largest Neo-nazi group in America has about 400 members (in a 300+ million country). The infamous KKK has about 6-8,000.

I'm not even trying to say Europe is more racist than the US or vice versa.

no, we just have a trade agreement - a fta, not a common market, certainly not a single market. 

sure I don't think there would be any problem signing a trade agreement with the UK should it leave. This is far from comprehensiveness of the acquis in trade restrictions it removes (it wouldn't practically even be possible without a common authority and regulatory bodies to do too much on non-tariff barriers to trade), so I don't think the advantage needs to be balanced with obligation of free movement. A deeper relationship, like the interlinking bilateral agreements EU has with Switzerland - those do.

&gt; PS. I see I've been downvoted throughout this thread just for not being pro-EU. Are people on here really so opposed to debate they don't want to even hear the other side?

There's some debate going on here? Thought we were speaking about Article 7 procedure in case of noncompliance with treaties. You asked, I answered a couple of questions. And corrected some claims I thought were factually incorrect. We'd need to state some opposing views on something to have a debate, no?

Really what is there to debate; its a practical fact that treaty revision won't happen that soon, and that UK couldn't have chosen a point less likely to change when revision does come back to the table than removing any of the ""4 freedoms"". IMHO better if they advocate opting out of CAP, there's some precedant there at least. Though it would likely cost it the rebate but still..

If that makes the UK wish to leave, its their choice, what can anyone really debate there?

I was riled up by the suggestion that majority population of some member state would wish their government breaks the law? Not that they leave, which is certainly their right, but that they stay but ignore the treaties ??? I can't even ... IDK what to say, is it lack of information so that they think no obligations were signed, don't know about direct effect and primacy of eu law over national and similar, or are they for real?

&gt;Russland hat nicht die Absicht, in den trüben Gewässern internationaler Politik zu fischen, die durch das sich immer stärker ausbreitende amerikanische »Weltreich des Chaos« entstanden sind, 

Breitet sich Russland nicht aus, mit ebenso riesigen wie völkerrechtlich zweifelhaften Gebietsansprüchen in der Arktis, und machtpolitischen ""Heim-ins-Reich"" Aktionen wie in der Ukraine?

&gt;Russland hat kein Interesses an der Ausbreitung chaotischer und instabiler Zustände, will keinen Krieg und hat nicht die Absicht, einen zu beginnen

Balten, Ukrainer, Georgier und Tschetschenen dürften dem kaum zustimmen.

&gt;Hinsichtlich seiner Außen- und mehr eigentlich noch seiner Innenpolitik werden sich Russlands Macht und Einfluss nicht auf die Eliten und deren Hinterzimmer-Absprachen, sondern auf den Willen der Bevölkerung gründen.

Auf den ""Willen der Bevölkerung""? Das wäre allerdings neu, insbesondere für eben diese Bevölkerung. Nur ein Beispiel hierzu, von der *Moscow Times*, [Putin's One-Man Rule Favors Luck Over Logic](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/putin-s-one-man-rule-favors-luck-over-logic/505211.html):

&gt;To an outside observer, Russia may appear to be punching above its geopolitical weight in Ukraine. Despite appearances though, the Kremlin's policy-making process is breaking down under the strains of one-man rule.

Nein, vielleicht war Nordkorea irgendwann mal sozialistisch, aber die Juche-Ideologie hat nix mit Sozialismus zu tun, bestenfalls kann man Nordkorea heutzutage als Monarchie bezeichnen.

Erdogan's main supporting demographic is definitely the religious people that are lower and middle class. Especially the working class. CHP is supported by secular demographics that are mainly the middle to upper class. In most cities where AKP won, CHP gets most of the remaining votes. That's why AKP seems to have a higher amount of cities to their name when compared to their overall votes percentage.

L'islamisme, c'est la doctrine politique de l'islam. C'est l'islam appliqué à la politique.

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamisme

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism

&gt;Le concept d'« islamisme » a été critiqué, notamment par Thomas Deltombe qui le qualifie de «catégorie infiniment élastique », «qu’aucun expert ne se risque à définir autrement que par des formules creuses», et qui « permet d’unifier toute une série de mouvements, de courants ou de personnalités sous une même bannière, indépendamment de leurs objectifs, de leurs modalités d’action et des contextes politiques, historiques et géographiques dans lesquels ils s’inscrivent. »

Oui, comme la catégorie ""extrême droite"". Le fait que le concept soit critiqué n'enlève rien au fait qu'il est utilisé, reconnu et clairement défini par de nombreux autres penseurs. Les interprétations de l'islam étant nombreuses, il est normal que ça conduise à différents types d'islamisme.

Par ailleurs, Thomas Deltombe est un journaliste d'extrême gauche (il travaille au Diplo) qui essaie de déconstruire tout ce qui critique l'islam de près ou de loin. C'est un propagandiste pro-Islam de plus.

&gt;Et perso je ne connais aucun groupe qui a réellement la capacité d'instaurer la charia dans le monde

Ce n'est pas une histoire de capacité mais de volonté. Si Ben Laden et Al-Qaïda n'avaient pas de visée mondiale, ils n'auraient pas fait d'attentats. Si Daech n'avait pas de visée mondiale, ils n'iraient pas recruter des milliers de combattants en Europe. De toute façon l'opposition à l'occident c'est officiel chez certains ennemis de la France.

&gt;du coup l'islamisme dont tu parles n'existe pas

Le lien logique est de trop. Il n'y a pas de conséquence et en plus c'est complètement faux. Je n'ai qu'à citer [Houari Boumédiène](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houari_Boum%C3%A9di%C3%A8ne)

Pareil pour Kadhafi :

""Sans épée, sans fusil, sans conquêtes, 50 millions de musulmans en Europe la transformeront bientôt en continent musulman.""

Ou encore Erdogan :

Et ""Grâce à vos lois démocratiques, nous vous envahirons. Grâce à nos lois religieuses, nous vous dominerons"".

Generally EU membership has a fairly clearly defined set of characteristics. Now a country here or there has some limitations to its participation. UK membership is already quite anomalous by the amount of its nonparticipation. And it desires to thin its connections further. At some point one simply stops and thinks - why is this country so very specific; stay if you wish to be a member state and share at least some sembalance of typical EU membership, or if you don't want to, just don't.

Basically membership is an internal UK matter and doesn't really concern the rest of the continent. Changing what membership means just because this would suit the UK - why would we bother?

Free movement of workers matter is certainly a case in point. It is absolutely impossible for it to change; requirement to do so is treaty revision - unanimous vote by all member states, ratification in all parliaments and ratification in the european parliament. I can't see it passing any of those 3 steps. Nobody, even non-members like Norway or Switzerland has an exception there. Not even when a referendum in the country forces the matter - Comission simply rejects any changes on the matter (Switzerland again). This ability to live anywhere in the EU is a freedom with a really broad support, and on the contrary to change it would require really wide agreement. 

Further, the EU is rather interested in deepening the single market (and has to a significant extent during the outgoing Barosso II Commission), including, to some extent, the movement of workers. 

Why pick politically impossible fights? Why not CAP for eg, that might happen (theoretically at least), in that exceptions exist etc? Or even better, practical matters, defined by ordinary legislative procedure rather than by treaties - imho the greatest value of UK in the EU its is consistent support for free markets, more effective regulation etc. And there's a ton of regulatory burdain that could and should be shed.

Free movement of goods, services, capital and workers is the definition of single market. Which is at core of the EU project. If even that doesn't suit it, why is it a member even?",0,1414936115,null,0,1414937497,0,clqrb5r,t3_2l1yn9,t1_clqrb5r,t1_clqqj4b,null,1426230143,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Now that I'm at a conversational level after 4 years, nothing can beat just sitting having a conversation with a native speaker. You get to a point where really all you need is to maintain fluency and expand vocabulary. So to do that I attend occasional conversation meetups and I couple that with trying to consume as much content in german as I can, and doing it in place of consuming English media, namely:

-German films
-TV (Stromberg is great, just like The Office), 
-Audio podcast called Radio Tatort (radio theatre-crime thrillers), -Der Postillon (German version of The Onion)
-Duo Lingo for a quick 5min refresher
-I use an Android app called Deutsche Zeitungen which catalogues almost all the major German news websites/newspapers. It's great.


I couple all this with an app called ""Dict.cc"" which is a very comprehensive free dictionary that you can download for offline use.

&gt; Q. Did you propose a way out of the euro?

&gt; A. The recovery of sovereignty, which is what we are proposing, in monetary policy involves designing a strategy with other countries in southern Europe, with which we are in a similar situation. What is perfectly clear is that **this euro does not work**. We do not intend to return to the past, to the peseta (Spain's previous coin). We propose its unacceptable that there is only a single currency which is not controlled by democratic institutions. The European Central Bank is not acting to protect the citizen, taking the reasonable economic measures should be taken.

&gt; Q. So what is the proposal?

&gt; A. It depends . The basic formula is that the economy must be democratised. If the formula is a new currency to be called differently, if it still should be the euro, if we should make a new monetary action, it remains to be seen in light of the circumstances ...

&gt; Q. You usually refer to the division between Southern Europe and Northern Europe in your speech: ""The South can not be a colony of the North"". Are you in favor of the European Union or not , despite all the faults it has and the mistakes it makes ?

Seriously, how so? I presume that you mean it's triumphalist because you link it to anti-EU sentiment, where does remembering our war dead in any way proclaim our triumph or superiority over anyone else? It has nothing to do with anyone else, the one thing the guardian did get right was that it is an introspective event. We're allowed to be introspective there's nothing wrong with not remembering your enemies or allies (again I should point out that Commonwealth soldiers from around the world are also remembered as part of the British dead with those men from the British isles themselves) at every event.

I've taken part in remembrance all my life and I've worn a poppy every year, the idea that it's a new phenomenon or in any way linked to a 'fuck johnny foreigner' attitude is a fallacy.

&gt;Oh come on. The sentiment surrounding the two is nowhere near the same. Guy Fawkes is a fun holiday for the children, an excuse to do something exciting as the autumn gloom sets in. Bad comparison.

We burn a man in effigy for centuries because we foiled a Catholic plot, just because *you* think it's a bit of fun doesn't mean that it isn't fundamentally a triumphalist holiday. In NI I suspect it's a more contentious issue. 

You clearly think that Britain is increasing in xenophobia, I don't disagree (I will point out the rise of Front Nacional in France though as an example of a massive French xenophobic upsurge too) what I do disagree with is the idea that this is inextricably linked with remembrance. 

Armistice day is fundamentally an antiwar holiday it's a time to remember the tragic cost of war and to ensure we do our best to prevent such losses happening again, there's nothing jingoistic about it in the slightest. It has a national (Commonwealth) focus yes but that doesn't invalidate its message just because not everyone in the world ever affected by war is remembered.

I don't just call it, I said why it was. You on the other hand just say it wasn't. 

&gt; What is irrelevant here is whether a government can or cannot kill citizens.

Yet you brought up that up.

&gt; Citizens kept revolting and Yanukovych fled the country,

You're just repeating what I said as if that made *you* right. 

&gt; Remember when the EU send a diplomatic envoy and worked out a compromise according to all the parliamentary rules you mention?
 
Sure I do. 

&gt;  The revolts continued even then, Yanukovich got scared, and he fled. 

Yes. 

Your approach to arguing is interesting, you failed to make any point whatsoever. The president was overthrown by protests. His deposition didn't follow due process and the constitution was ignored. The parliament and government changed completely and, despite being commonly labeled *interim*, yet no parliamentary elections were called. It's a coup by any [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). 

&gt;  *""A coup d'état, also known as a coup, a putsch, or an overthrow, is the sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body. A coup d'état is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance. When the coup either fails or doesn't entirely succeed, a civil war is a possible consequence.""*

You can argue it was justified, but it was a coup. And as with any coup if a significant part of the population doesn't feel represented and is against the takeover, civil war is a likely possibility. And if the new established system behaves in a hostile manner towards that part of the population, then revolt is not only likely but expected.

false,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; You're dismissing the large problems with the current system

I don't know that there are that many. Some people feel inconvenienced because they can't go shopping whenever they want to. The majority of Germans, though, are very happy with the system as it is and the German economy is doing very well.

&gt; You're also ignoring the numerous other ways other countries go about doing things. 

No, because I am not attempting to solve Germany's problems. I am attempting to explain some of the reasons behind Germany's current system, and why most people don't want it to change.

&gt; in Poland, during a public holiday, only the owner of a store is allowed to work. Which is a blessing for small stores.

That's one way to go about it; but then, the end result is not all that different from what is already happening in Germany. Most stores are closed, but some are open.

&gt; In some places, they flock on Sundays to big malls, drink coffee and buy stuff.

Yes, but they're just doing it on Sunday instead of on some other day. Nobody ever says, ""Oh, the stores are open, let's think of something to buy."" It simply doesn't work like that: once you've done your weekly grocery shop, you've done your weekly grocery shop.

&gt; Just because you reject this culture doesn't mean it's not good for the economy.

Equally, just because you reject the German way of doing things doesn't mean it's not good for the economy.

&gt; closing everything on Sundays is a luxury

Exactly, yes. And we can well afford this luxury. The German economy is doing very well indeed -- it weathered the global economic crisis better than most.

&gt; is it right that we're all working mostly 8-17?

It helps when you know that at the times you're in your office, everyone else you have to work with is also able to take your calls.

&gt; you'll find many examples of large corporations going away from this model

...forcing people to work shifts, which is unpopular, detrimental to health and makes it harder for families to plan time together, impacting on family life and social cohesion. The compromise is flexitime, but even when you're on flexitime you can't just pick and choose which hours you want to work, because that can leave the office understaffed at some times and overstaffed at others.

&gt; Sometimes people need to work 70hrs a week, or the company might fail

Then the company has a much more deep-seated problem, and is making the issue worse by flouting the law, and forcing its workers to work long hours, presumably for no (or very little) extra pay, and coming into work without being properly rested, which will affect productivity. Such a company will find that all of its competent workers will find better jobs elsewhere, leaving only the incompetent ones. High staff turnover means more time and resources taken up hiring and training new workers, and general lack of morale which, once again, translates into decreased productivity, high rates of sick leave and always the threat of a lawsuit or even prosecution, if a disgruntled ex-worker decides to go to a tribunal.

It is possible, and very common, for small businesses to thrive while complying with labour laws and generally treating their workers with dignity and respect.

It's all about management, this thing you think is a ""minor issue"". Management is crucial. Incompetent management is routinely responsible for companies going bust all over the place. Probably the biggest recent example in Germany was the collapse of Schlecker, which wouldn't have happened if it was being run properly: the family lost tens of millions of their personal wealth trying to save the company, because it was still being run as an e.K. -- that is, a single trader employing staff, instead of, say, a limited liability company.

Ça fait presque 20 ans que j'ai quitté la France sans regrets et je ne me considère plus vraiment français, c'est juste un mot sur mon passeport maintenant. J'ai rien à faire avec eux...

Quant à la critique de la France, ben faut admettre qu'elle est quand même bien méritée dans plein de domaines et que d'autres pays font largement mieux. Quand j'étais en France, c'était chomage et jobs de merde mal payés et on me disait que mon ""profil"" était inemployable, que sans piston je n'arriverai à rien et c'était pas faux. Merci au système éducatif de merde, mal foutu et complètement étranger au monde du travail (j'espère que ça s'est amélioré en 20+ ans). Mes diplômes ne valent RIEN et n'ont même pas d'équivalence ailleurs. Chouette, un bac+4 pour rien.

J'ai ensuite passé plus de 10 ans en Suisse, où j'ai eu la joie d'avoir plein de boulot et où j'ai bien gagné ma vie (à mon compte) avec un sentiment de liberté supérieur à celui qu'on a en France (plus de respect civique, respect du travail et moins d'insécurité). La Suisse n'est pas parfaite, loin de là, mais y'a quand même une sacré différence entre vivre dans un pays abec 15% de chômage (officiel) et 5%. Oh et mon bac+4 n'était même pas équivalent à leur équivalent du bac là-bas mais une fois que j'ai fait mes preuves c'était bon.

Une fois au Canada, ça a été encore encore mieux professionnellement et j'ai pu me construire une vie bien sympathique (bon job, acheté une maison, fondé une famille etc.) car c'est mon expérience qui compte ici et pas mes diplomes et le système fonctionne plutôt bien, y'a largement moins de profiteurs. Chômage faible, plein d'opportunités, attitude positive et pas cette sempiternelle obsession d'enculer le système.

Procès d'intention. Qu'est-ce qui te fait dire ça ?

Par contre, une simple lecture de leur affiche permet de dire qu'elle est mensongère. Le titre est faux déjà, ce n'est pas le peuple algérien qui se soulève, c'est une minorité violente qui assassine des innocents. Ensuite, colonne de gauche, les gentils algériens n'ont pas résisté depuis l'antiquité, ils se sont fait eux-mêmes coloniser par les arabes puis les turcs. Les faits, c'est qu'avant la France, il n'y avait pas d'Algérie ni de peuple algérien.

&gt;les gens de bagnolet sont des traîtres

Ils célèbrent de facto des ennemis annoncés de la France, et prennent un point de vue visant à culpabiliser la méchante France et à encenser les gentils terroristes algériens. C'est l'entretien de la haine de la France chez des immigrés qui ne sont plus là parce que la France c'est mieux, mais pour prendre leur revanche contre la France.

Tout est résumé [ici](http://www.leparisien.fr/abo-faitdujour/ces-eleves-qui-ne-se-sentent-pas-francais-16-10-2008-277609.php) :

*Dans mon collège, de très nombreux élèves, une quinzaine par classe environ, expriment une volonté affichée de désaffiliation nationale. Ils portent des sweat-shirts aux couleurs du Maroc, écrivent Algérie en force sur leur trousse, disent que la Marseillaise, que je leur fais apprendre en 4 e , n'est pas leur hymne, ou que ça sert à rien. Ils ont un vrai problème de positionnement identitaire : pas question d'apparaître français. Pour certains, être céfran, c'est la honte, c'est être un bouffon, un bolos (quelqu'un qui a peur), voire un jambon-beurre. Tous ou presque mais pas les Asiatiques préfèrent revendiquer la nationalité d'origine de leur famille, même lointaine. La France, ce n'est pas leur patrie, mais un pays dans lequel ils vivent, une nationalité administrative, juste des papiers. Bref, ils ne se sentent pas français.*

&gt;j'aurai mieux fait de dire que la seule chose de vraiment consensuel dans cette histoire est que la guerre est finie et que c'est une bonne chose que nous soyons désormais en paix

Je pense que nous ne sommes pas en paix. La désintégration menace notre pays, et ce genre de commémorations y contribue.

&gt;A moins que tu ne sois un de ces jusqu'au boutistes qui pensent qu'on aurait jamais dû se séparer de l'algérie et continuer la guerre jusqu'à maintenant, bien sûr.

Nope, je suis gaulliste. Il n'y avait pas d'intégration possible hier et aujourd'hui non plus l'intégration de millions de nouveaux immigrés pauvres et non éduqués n'est pas possible.

Everyone has to fit in one of those categories (white, black, indigenous American, etc.) and they are everywhere for you to remember. The census, polls, job applications, everywhere you can be asked about your racial category. Many times I've used American-based websites or services and I've been taken aback by them asking me about my race. It is like a form of social categorisation you cannot escape from. 

I believe in Europe we don't focus so much in race, as we do in nationality. Over there you are all ""Americans"" (and then your race), but as here the nationality thing does not work the same way, we give it more weight to it. Yes here black people are called black, but there aren't elements intrinsically related to them; black people do not form their own ""black culture"" as they seem to have in the US, but they keep their national cultures from their actual countries. The same goes for other races, including white people.

Another thing that strikes me as odd is when people start talking by saying ""well, I'm a white 20-year-old guy and..."", they have that need to let everyone know their race, as if because of being of a certain racial category you were expected to behave or to articulate on a certain way, maybe believing that the meaning of the actions to be described would be different if it involved different races. Where I live I have never heard anyone saying anything first stating their race. *""Soy blanco y..""*, it does not even sound right. Here you're never asked about your race, and most people never say they're white. They might say they're Basques, or Spaniards, maybe perhaps European, but that's it.

Also the election itself is against the Ukrainian law, the Minsk Agreement, and has been deemed illegitimate by the UN, the EU, the US ect. and so far the only country claiming to recognise the illegitimate election has been Russia (again, despite the signing of the Minsk Agreement).

Russian propaganda media inclúding the RT [claimed earlier that they were OSCE observers](https://twitter.com/RobPulseNews/status/528634681320017920). After that [the OSCE said](https://twitter.com/OSCE_SMM/status/528625628237811713) it has not sent observers to the ""so-called “elections” in East Ukraine"". 

So, those guys invented a sham organisation to fool people, the ASCE or the ""Agency for Security and Cooperation in Europe"", under which to observe the illegitimate election: [Sham observer org for Ukrainian separatist strongholds invented day before election](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/sham-observer-org-for-ukrainian-separatist-strongholds-invented-day-before-election/article21418834/)

As disgusting and disheartening the title is, it is also apparently correct.

Wer Kritik am ""amerikanischen Imperialismus"" üben will, sollte das nicht tun, um den großrussischen Imperialismus zu beschönigen, wenn nicht zu verherrlichen.

&gt;Und man sollte Russland ernst nehmen und als Partner und Freund sehen

Von einem ""Freund und Partner"" wird man nicht mit dem Abdrehen vertraglich garantierter Öl- und Gaslieferungen bedroht. Ein ""Freund und Partner"" veranstaltet nicht einen neuen kalten Krieg in Europa, fördert sezessionistische Bewegungen in Nachbarländern, oder setzt dort heimlich eigene Truppen ein.  

&gt;Die Amerikaner haben aber genau so tiefgreifende Probleme

Wer sich mit  *""tu quoque*"" und *""what about…""* zu rechtfertigen versucht, der gesteht damit auch indirekt seine eigenen Verfehlungen.

Davon, daß auch die Amerikaner ""Probleme haben"", wird Putin und seine Herrschaft um keinen Deut besser. 

&gt;so wie es Schröder getan hat

Der jetzt wohlversorgt bei der Gazprom-Tochter Nord Stream AG im Aufsichtsrat sitzt? Dein ""Genosse der Bosse"" ist ein schmieriger Egoist, der prima zu den Oligarchen von Putins Günstlingswirtschaft passt. 

&gt;Das einzige was wir in Deutschland und Europa über Russland hören ist negativ, das sollte jedem noch kritisch denkenden Menschen zu denken geben

Kritisch denkende Menschen erinnern sich an die Zeiten vor Putins Aggressionsphase, als die Berichterstattung über Russland wesentlich freundlicher war. Kritisch denkende Menschen wunder sich, wo all die pro-russische Propaganda in deutschen Medien herkommt, mit ihrer Hysterie über ""NATO-Einkreisung"", amerikanische Agenten, ukrainische Faschisten etc.pp.

false,maefuckingeri,EURO,European Union,"&gt; As for impeachment - it's tricky since there's just no provision for president simply going missing. AFAIR, his impeachment was legal under 2004 constitution which was rolled back into place as part of the agreement, but which he did not actually sign...

Indeed the situation was tricky, I agree. But you follow the law you have, don't just make it up on the spot as convenient. The one option was to follow a proper impeachment process, which didn't happen. When you're justifying process with non-signed bills you know walking a very fine line and crossing it and going opss...

But it's worse than that. Have it your way, they passed a bill deposing the president. But even [this bill](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-morrison/ukraine-willliam-hague_b_4933177.html) didn't have 3/4 of the votes as required by law. 

So we can try to justify why due process wasn't followed. But it seems evident that it was not. 

&gt; Parliament was the only legitimate source of power at the time (in the absence of the president and the whole cabinet)

True we can agree here (somewhat anyway, if I recall correctly post-Maidan there were multiple changes in affiliation, making the parliament look nothing like post election, which I would say make it somewhat questionable, but moving on...).

&gt; so disbanding it then wouldn't have brought much of a benefit, to put it lightly. Also, calling early elections is permissible only in specific scenarios, one of which was executed by the president in August.

How was there a scenario justifying snap elections now that didn't exist then? Here's Kyiv Post, 6 of March, [2/3 of Ukrainians in favour of early elections](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/over-two-thirds-of-ukrainians-favor-early-rada-elections-338617.html).

Yes, I can understand it is a messy situation. But this messy situation was indeed the result of Maidan. And pretending Maidan was a great example of democracy in action makes no sense. 


&gt; Svoboda took part in the new coalition (and forming the government) because there was no one else.

Sure I understand why it happened. But it doesn't change that this again was the state of affairs post-Maidan. Svoboda in the parliament. See point 8 of this EU parliament [resolution](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2012-0507+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN).  
 

&gt; And the language ""attack"" issue is so fucking old and tired by now... Parliament, not government. The motion was not signed, it was to go back to Soviet-time law, not to ban Russian language. Also, to give some context, this happened on Sunday, next day after Yanukovich fled and remnants of the parliament were busy installing some semblance of temporary order and rolling back the worst of the old legislation. That law was passed with gross violations and there was even a mini-Maydan about it the time, you know?

Fair point, parliament no government, my bad. 

As for the rest I honestly don't see where you're getting at. The law was proposed by Fatherland and approved with 86% of the votes in parliament, in a very rushed manner. And yes it was the return to a very controversial and problematic state of affairs. And it was very worrying inside and [outside](http://www.osce.org/hcnm/115643) Ukraine.  

If anything you're agreeing with me that what followed Maidan were very questionable calls, that created tension, by a barely functional parliament that most people wanted subject to elections again.

And I never said it was to ban Russian. I said this proposed law, was a big blow to the ethnic Russian community (although not only them). Much like the one on the criminalisation of the (admittedly already illegal)  dual nationality.

I don't know why the opinion of the average voter matters. And I don't have very high opinion of the militants of the party at this point if somebody continues there is probably for connections and/or getting a public office to use for corruption.

[There is support in the party for the grand coalition](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/05/12/actualidad/1399875819_660624.html). There is a lot of people in the party that would fight a government with a party that would try to reduce corruption or push for left-leaning policies that would threaten the interest of the companies that fund the party and have the elders of the party in the payroll.

If we want a clean start an organization like the PSOE shouldn't be near the government.

&gt; The main interest the party has is self-preservation, and a grand coalition certainly wouldn't serve it. This is why Sánchez has now swerved leftwards.

A grand coalition would keep anybody that wants to clean the public administration out of power 4 more years. That will seem like self-preservation for a lot of people with a long political trajectory. And they can let the PP have minority government with their support in the parliament. ERC is having a lot of success according to the polls and the EU elections with this strategy.

Talking is free. Rajoy promised lower taxes, honesty, transparency and so on. We have all the reasons to think that he is simply bullshitting.

&gt; Are you under the impression that I like him, perchance? Nope, I just said that, for the party to recover, he'll have to stand up (or at least be seen to stand up) to the regional barons. Of course that will mean betraying those same barons who have put him where he stands in the first place, but treachery is no novelty in politics, or the PSOE for that matter...

It's not only the regional barons: Felipe González, Alfonso Guerra (who is still in the parliament). A general secretary doesn't have as much power. And he isn't going to be automatically candidate for the elections, like Zapatero. He promised primaries for electing the candidate separatedly, that means that the barons still can fuck him.

He is a fruit of the party bureaucracy that has been only a city councilor in Madrid and a backbencher deputy. And a member of the Assembly of Caja Madrid where he did nothing except ratify the decisions of the board and getting a mortgage with employee conditions. He doesn't look like somebody passionated for making a difference or serving his country let's be honest.

Bullshit, russia planed to take the Odessa-crimea-mariupol-donetsk-luhansk-kharkhiv band either way.

BTW Ukraine denied trying to join NATO. But maybe chechenya tried to join nato too ? Or Yougoslavia ? or Dagestan ? or ... When russia is looking for an excuse, they always blame NATO.

Russia. When russia kill, it's russia fault. It's like a rapist saying the victim looked too cute so asked for it. The only valid answer to that kind of people is ""next time you get closer you get shot in the head."".

&gt; the Russians (Gorbatschow) were promised that NATO would NEVER move further to the east

And staline promised he would never invade/annexate the eastern european area. So maybe we have a right to annexate russia by force too ? See, using 50y old reasons works two way.

Vielleicht würdest du unter anderen Voraussetzungen etwas anderes denken, oder anders handeln. So bist du, und das ist genau das was so ungemütlich ist, nur der Zuschauer in der Welt die dein Gehirn für dich erschafft.

* The country was split 50/50 in support of the president from the beginning, so the protests that lead to his deposition weren't supported by the population in it's generality. 

* Due process wasn't followed. The deposition was illegal. And the result was a presidency with very questionable legitimacy, and to a lesser extent a government and even parliament.

* The actions that followed (e.g. proposed language and citizenship laws) were indeed quite hostile to those who had been against the protests, ousting of the president, and the new government. And these are significant part of the population. 

The manner in which the whole process was lead was very problematic and steered the country towards the mess it finds itself in. To ignore reality and simply blame everything on others is a sure way to repeat history.

A term spanning hundreds of years, involving all kinds of cultural and historical significance. To say it boils down to simply differentiating members of society as being of a different race is simply ignorant of American history. For a long time, blacks were NOT a part of established American society in any real sense. They did not have the right to vote, citizenship, etc. They were literal slaves for hundreds of years. One could only really make an argument that they achieved that status post civil rights era in the 1960s and even most would go further and argue they have not achieved that full status today. 

People refer to them as African-American in the same way that people use Irish,German,Italian or whatever American. That is to refer to their cultural context within American culture as a whole. The difference being the definition of ""black"" or African American was established hundreds of years ago. Hell the definition of who was white and who not was still fluid up until a few decades ago and even now is undergoing changes with how it's being adapted to include (or exclude) people. Particularly Hispanic immigrants. The even bigger reason is because those identities melded into 'white' awhile ago, whereas the white/black divide is still a very real thing in the US. There's no point in pretending it doesn't exist. Hell half of racial conflict in the US RESULTS from people ignoring that conflict exists in the first place. 

Simply calling someone black or African-American is not racist and like I said is only viewed as such by Tumblr SJW types. However, race has been a major factor in ones societal standing in the United States throughout its history and continues to be so today. So yes people have identified these trends and attach labels like ""black"" and ""white"" to the people involved in these processes. That doesn't make it ""casual"" racism to describe someone as being black or African-American. It's simply a way to distinguish someone taking into account their cultural upbringing and to give an idea as to the kinds of discrimination they've historically and currently face. 

Yes, the race in African-American is emphasized by its very nature. Doesn't mean they're not seen as much of Americans as anyone else. The race is emphasized because race is a much bigger part of everyday life and history in the United States as opposed to Europe. 

African-Americans have their own very proud history and culture within United States history and culture. Why the hell should they give that up because some people feel it's ""racist""?

2-3 hour queues in some cases a lot more

I think it's done on purpose because the diaspora votes mainly against the government and especially against PSD.

the campaign is very dirty

PSD accused the main opponent, Iohannis, of being childless, trafficking kids in the 90s ( they even sent propaganda mail with things like this) and the PM and main candidate Ponta also compared the president's regime to that of nazis.

In Paris that is the only place where you can vote. The diaspora there isn't that small to warrant this.

and some people in Spain were paid 30 euros, shirts and free drinks for their vote. Probably done by PSD. Most of the fraud is done in the country though mainly by having some guys in a bus and drive them from voting station to another one where they vote on some special lists. There are other ways too but more complicated.

some students of a big state ( ASE) uni had their ids detained by the dorms admins .. guess who that uni sides with.. they are trying to make it harder for them to vote because the youth also leans more against PSD and government

for other students voting away from home there weren't enough papers ( for some special lists) so they couldn't vote

in some places in the country turnout was over 100% but already acknowledged as errors

low turnout ~~~35%~~ just under 50pc 2nd round in a couple of weeks

there was no debate between candidates and it's possible that it won't be even for the 2nd round. PSD doesn't want to risk.

results tomorrow

some people in Munchen waited from 3 to 21 and then the doors were closed. Lots of people didn't get to vote because of very crooked organising. It is on purpose.

It was the Ottoman Empire that was called the ""sick man of Europe"" rather than Turkey. Atatürk came about in response to this, he didn't cause it. 

&gt;I'm just damning the lazy attitude of Turks in the past. So what if you lost the war? So did Japan, but look at their resolve and their recovery. Too damn honourful people, my people.

Japan actually fought on the side of the Allies in World War I (the only World War Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) fought in.) So I don't understand the comparison. You were neutral in World War II. Japan also got a lot of help with post-war reconstruction because the United States feared that Japan would go Communist if aid wasn't provided. The Korean War was also a big help for Japan because Japan was America's forward operating base during that conflict - and a lot of money flowed into Japan because of it. 

Turkey didn't enjoy those advantages.

But as my source shows they still take tax money. Quite possibly huge amounts. Amounts that are disproportionate in relation to the profits they make from their own companies, disproportionate in relation to the country's economy, disproportionate in relation to the country's wealth distribution and disproportionate in relation to other monarchies.

I'm not a religious person, nor am I a fan of monarchy. But I do see the need in most people for a powerful role model. Like a good (grand)parent, but for adults. Someone who has inherent power but uses it responsibly, because he wants what's best for everyone. Saying what needs to be said and doing what needs to be done, even if this involves some major risks. I can honestly appreciate the need for someone like that. But I think any major power figure will fail if they act the opposite of that image. And I think that's what's happening here. Yes, big risks can come with big rewards, but I can't personally justify this exuberance. The new palace of the Turkish president, nor the amount(!) of tax money taken by the Moroccan monarchy.

That's a bold statement, for an ignorant. As an expert in this field, which you decidedly aren't, I have screened your ""debunking"" link several times now, and have found errors and half-truths. This is the full paper by the guys analyzing the BT modems:

http://cryptome.org/2013/12/Full-Disclosure.pdf

***It, too, contains errors and half-truths.***

However, their paper is very detailed and ***much of it is technically accurate and very interesting***. The most important error is the assumption that BT wouldn't be stupid enough to assign 30/24 to its internal modem-side network.

Apparently they are, and this may be apparent from the ping times, as well as from various traceroute techniques, had the authors attempted them.

Yes, I definitely do need to be rude. If you don't know what you're talking about, you should most definitely shut up.

While in this context its use was intended with a certain poetic liberty, it actually can be:

&gt;     Ignorant \Ig""no*rant\, n.

See that ""n""? That means ""noun"".

&gt; I don't want to argue with you on this, so don't reply.

I will be the judge of that.

&gt; I'm not pro-GCHQ, but this particular story is largely false.

Even though it contains errors, you don't understand what you're talking about, so you're simply not in a position to establish that. The problem here is that we may be dealing with a ""true lie"", that is: while this specific case leaves much to be desired in terms of establishing a direct link to GCHQ, ***what's much more important is that the current technical infrastructure of ISP-supplied broadband modems and their provisioning allows for all sorts of remote control and private LAN intrusion*** ... and from the Snowden documents, we know that routers, whether commerical or private, are subject to subversion by NSA, and the NSA has ""special relationships"" with manufacturers.

So many bad experiences from people I thought were sophisticated and socially evolved. Far from the treatment I gave at home, towards fellow Europeans. I grew up some more and that view cemented itself because very few dared to counter it. My experience with Northern Europeans was a disgrace, even prior to the 2008 crisis. Southern Europeans were considered a subspecies of humans. I heard some Balkan type of shit talk from Germans, Swiss, Dutch. And after 2008 it all came crashing down, like a dam of bile that had been pent up for decades. 

I couldn't agree more when you say trust has to be earned. Historically, trust among Europeans is bar fight topic. Much more back stabbing than anyone can be comfortable with. We all start with negative amounts of trust. 

I distrust the intentions of Northern Europe and I distrust the EU which is puppet of Germany - a most woodenfaced mischievous nation set on realizing centuries old imperialistic ambitions now through economic weight. And while a vast majority welcomes the Germanification of Europe, in line with the modern prevailing self-loathing sentiment among Europeans, I don't. 

I know the EU's fate, because it is designed to fail. It's painfully obvious.  I predict a world of suffering coming to every young European, particularly those in the South. But there are many wildcards coming into play - Russia, China, IS, US, the UK, and perhaps the schemers of all this won't get theirs either.

If you truly believe that it is thanks to 'indoctrination' that so many people respect them, then you my friend are the one that is indoctrinated. The cult of personality really began with his successors in different forms.

&gt; ""Hey let's teach these kids something useful"" said no one ever in Turkey for a long time. ""Teach them how great Atatürk was, OVER AND OVER AGAIN"" instead. That'll fucking help the economy.

Turkish education does suck. No argument there. The children should be taught different Atatürk related topics, than what he looked like for example. But even that is better than what pupils are going to receive as an 'education' from now on. Everything is leaning towards a more Islamic education. Those who can not get into schools of their choice, have to enrol in the religious schools.

&gt; Turkey was a dump for the last 100 years. No wonder the entire world labeled Turkey as an ill country.

Turkey isn't even a 100 years old. It was the Ottoman Empire that was labeled the sick man of Europe, not Turkey. Taking that into account, I'd dare say Atatürk has done a might fine job.


&gt; But hey, I'm not hating on Atatürk. I'm just damning the lazy attitude of Turks in the past. So what if you lost the war? So did Japan, but look at their resolve and their recovery. Too damn honourful people, my people.

In terms of the actual Berlin Wall coming down, America truly had nothing to do with it. Essentially, a couple of East Bloc countries (Czechoslovakia and Hungary, to be exact) had relaxed their border restrictions with Austria. East Germans were travelling to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and then simply walking across to Austria, and making their way to West German embassies, where they were given West German passports (that was the policy at the time). This mass exodus was a huge problem for East Germany, and it was clear the status quo couldn't last. By this time, the Soviet Union had started its policy of ""perestroika"" (""reconstruction"") and ""glasnost"" (""transparency"", roughly), opening up to the west and ending the Cold War. Only East Germany remained, but was beginning to attempt some reforms.

It was the evening of November 9th, 1989, that the wall actually fell. Exactly who knew what, who had planned what and even what went wrong and why (or whether the whole thing was a set-up) isn't known, and various people have contradicted each other on what happened. But the usual story goes something like this:

The East German government had drafted some new legislation on visas for East Germans wishing to travel to West Germany. Apparently, this was planned for later, and the legislation was facing a couple of legal obstacles. Nonetheless, on his way to a press conference -- something completely new to East Germany -- the newly-appointed press secretary, Günter Schabowski, was given a press release. Whether he was supposed to read it out at that press conference is one of the things that's disputed. One account says there should have been an embargo on it, but it wasn't noted on the document and Schabowski hadn't been told about it.

The press conference went ahead, and Schabowski was giving a typical politician's non-commital answer to a journalist's quite mundane question, when he suddenly remembered he had been given a press release. This part is on film and not in dispute: he read it out, and it said that East Germans wanting to travel to West Germany would be given visas to do so, no questions asked.

A journalist asked when this new regulation would come into effect. Schabowski searched through the press release, but couldn't find a date on it. So he said, ""As far as I know, immediately, without delay.""

This was quickly -- but quite wrongly -- reported on that day's news as: ""The borders are open."" Particularly in Berlin, people started arriving at various border crossing points expecting to be let through, but the border guards hadn't been given any orders.

Eventually, at Bornholmer Straße crossing point, the decision was taken by the guards there to open the border, lest there be a riot. Initially, they stamped the passports of everyone going through (in fact, unknown to the people at the time, their passports had been cancelled, the intention being not to let them back in again), but they soon abandoned that idea because of the crowds and just opened the border completely. By midnight, all the crossing points were open.

That's more or less it. America had absolutely nothing to do with that side of things.

Where America was involved, of course, was in keeping the balance of power during the Cold War and insuring that East Germany didn't get its hands on West Berlin. Also, of course, the end of the Cold War as a whole involved lots of very constructive talks between the USSR on one side, and America and Britain on the other.

But Reagan's ""tear down this wall"" speech, while it embodied the spirit of the moment, was little more than showmanship at that point. It wasn't actually Gorbachev's wall to tear down, and in any case the events that would lead to its fall were already well under way by then.

Americans and Canadians will joke with each other all day but it's a different story when the context becomes Americans making fun of Mexicans.

The difference between European culture and American culture in this regard is that most Europeans think of any other European country as an equal and so the jokes and making fun for us, doesn't have the possibility of have a sinister tone about it. 

That doesn't work well with the American narrative on PC issues. They have to see Europe as fitting their dichotomy of the rich and poor, the well off and not so well off and shame on you if you're one of the rich ones making fun of one of the poor ones.

While I mostly agree with the sentiment, I think you're painting a very rosy picture there. 

There was a [UN resolution ](http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11493.doc.htm) calling upon states not to recognize changes in status of Crimea region. It was indeed adopted, and few voted against, but you should also consider abstentions. 

Look at the [results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_68/262). 
100 yes, 11 no, 58 abstained. So you can't really say those 69 consider it out of bounds. And I'm not even mentioning 24 who 'happened' to be absent, which sometimes for some can be very convenient. Effectively, less than half voted yes. 

The No is kind of what we'd expect. But now look at the Yes and Abstention. The [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_68/262#mediaviewer/File:UN_Resolution_regarding_the_territorial_integrity_of_Ukraine.svg)  is rather enlightening. The Abstention dominated Asia, most of South America, and more than half of Africa. The Yes was Europe, Northern America and friends. 

We're not just talking about dictatorships not condemning Russia here. On the Absent list are the likes of Brazil or India. In fact as you can see in that page countries voting Abstention alone makes up for more of half the world population. 

So saying annexation was considered out of bounds by almost every nation in the world, is not in line with reality. And while part of it is a matter of interest, be assured part of it is also a matter of history. The referendum may not have been properly conducted, but truth is most of those people have ties with Russia, and feel Russian.

Edit: I will try to explain what i mean.

Work and family related I've been to turkey quite a few times in the past 10 years, usually i am in the Aegean area e.g. Istanbul/Izmir/Bursa where my family comes from and where most of my customers are located.

Talking to the people i work with and to family members living in turkey made me aware of the fact that most of them are in some way not aware of the fact that television and media in turkey is strongly controlled by government. It always was, now even more than before.

Anything reported is strongly one sided, and a majority of people don't question these reports. This is not a problem  that only occurs in Turkey i am aware of that.

But if they get to see a report on TV in which RTP (Recep Tayyip Erdogan) tells them anything they just believe it. This is why most people in Turkey (and also most Turks(?) living in Germany) will tell you that under the governance of RTP Turkeys economical situation greatly improved compared to the state in which it was before.

And it really did. Awesome isn't it?

But how did he manage to achieve such an improvement? That unfortunately is a question most (or all) of his followers don't ask themselves.

Since 2000 the GDP has been constantly growing at 6% p.a., and is now more than 3 times the amount it was back then.

More than 70% of the economic expansion comes from inside the country, and this expansion was achieved through foreign investments.
Money was given to the Banks (not for free as you can imagine but as loans) and was passed on as loans to companies and regular people like you and me.

Nothing special that's what happens all around the world every day i guess.
Now here comes the problem, these foreign investors will eventually want their money back, and it's already happening that they have started to do so.

If i give you 100€ for a period of 5 years and tell you that i want 110€ back and you give these 100€ your friend for 5 years and get 120€ after these 5 years have passed i will get my 110€ and you will have some 10€ profit.

Everything's fine fine fine. NO its not.

If your friend wont be able to give you the money back or a part of it and if it's not 100€ but 75 billion (like american billion = 75.000.000.000) and you didn't give it to one friend but a few hundred-thousand friends and some of them can't pay you the money back, you are fucked.

And this is what will happen, investors are going to want their money back at the same time turkeys currency will even loose more value than it has already and the banks won't be able to pay back the fucking money.
Sorry but i am getting really angry while writing this down.

Private loans in turkey increased more than a hundredfold (? this sounds wrong) there are aprox. 75 Million people in Turkey and 56 Million credit cards and only with these 56 Million credit cards 40 Billion USD in loans were made.

42% of consumer loans were made by people earning 700€ or less a month. And this is the problem.

If one wishes to curb immigration, wether they are concerned about the perils of multiculturalism, people leaching off welfare, or British jobs being taken it makes infinitely more sense to start with non-EU immigration because theres more, extra EU immigrants presumably share less with the native Brits culturally, and most importantly, laws regarding extra-EU immigration are not governed by the EU and are thus far easier to amend. 

I can see why people might be worried about an influx of Roma into the UK for example, but at the end of the day the Roma make up a small minority of those coming to the UK and on the whole EU immigration is better for the UK economically and from a social stability viewpoint, the statistics really tell it all:

It isn't.

Listen, as an example, I don't know if you watch Dr. Who. It's a British series. You should pay attention at the races of the actors. They're generally white because there's more of them, but any black actor that shows up plays exactly the same role he'd play if he was white. This isn't a pretentious way to show they're equal - there just isn't a difference at all. There's no yoyo ghetto culture, no special African role, nothing. They're British, period.

Die war gut!) ein wenig abgeflacht und wir können uns normal unterhalten, auch über den normalen Small-Talk hinaus, jetzt wird sich rausstellen ob es passt.

I don't really know what you mean with the ""flow"" of a text, but it's true: Obviously, since i didn't translate the text literally, the sound and rhythm of my translation differ to the original. Another reason for this might be, that I, as a native speaker, have had the accentuation and the pauses in my head when i translated it. But i can assure you: When i read it, it sounds just fine to me - i would totally tell this to my girl if her birthday was tomorrow and i had wrote that text by myself. I also spoke it with pauses when i wrote it and it sounded good to me? So i cannot really see why it shouldn't sound beatiful? It's different in rhythm and so on, yeah, but i think when you translate something from a language to another, you can't really keep those things as they were in the original.. :-/

Can you maybe give me a little explanation on what you meant with the ""flow"" of a text? Maybe i could improve my translation a little bit if i understand what you're exactly meaning with it?

Mein Vergleich zwischen Nationalsozialismus und DDR bezieht sich in erster Linie auf die Struktur des Gesellschaftssystems: Jugend- und Parteiorganisationen, Militarisierung usw. Dieses System kam auch nicht später sondern wurde noch während der Kriegshandlungen in Form von Ulbricht nebst Schergen aus dem Hotel Lux nach Deutschland importiert.

Der Sozialismus bezieht sich, sowie auch andere linke Theorieschulen, im Kern auf die Arbeiten Marxs. Dieser postuliert unbestreitbar die Arbeitswerttheorie. Abgesehen davon, daß man aus einer ökonomischen Theorie keine ernstzunehmende Gesellschaftsordnung ableiten kann, trägt die Arbeitswerttheorie die Annahme über die Unmündigkeit des Individuums in sich. Ein solches Individuum, welches nicht in der Lage ist seine eigenen Präferenzen zu artikulieren und Wert zu schätzen ist demzufolge auch nicht in der Lage über sein politisches Schicksal zu entscheiden. Daher meine Zusammenfassung: Sozialismus gleich welcher Art bedingt stets die Abwesenheit von Freiheit (des Individuums) und Demokratie.

Nun kann man von der Idee des Sozialismus gern überzeugt sein - auch wenn ich persönlich weit davon entfernt bin. Hier geht es nur darum das die gleiche Partei, die verantwortlich für die Situation in der DDR war, heute jeglicher Schuld freigesprochen wieder politischen Einfluß erhält. Ich hege keinen Zweifel daran, dass diese Partei auch zukünftig ihrer ursprünglichen Ideologie treu bleibt und auf der Einführung eines sozialistischen und damit menschen-verachtenden Systems hinwirkt.

Ich stimme dir in dem letzten Punkt zu, im Jahre 2014 geht von der Linkspartei keine akute Bedrohung aus, wenn es die Linkspartei aber schafft gesellschaftlich die gleiche Akzeptanz wie eine freiheitliche Partei zu erlangen, dann wird die Bedrohung aber sehr akut sein.",0,1414952043,null,0,false,0,clqxvru,t3_2kzs2b,t1_clqxvru,t1_clqwd5a,null,1426227077,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

Those aren't all the problems. There are also issues with high house prices, difficulty getting a GP appointment, a lack of school places, an overburdened infrastructure.

I'm not sure why you see fit to call this ""elitism"". Statistically, university graduates are more likely to speak some English than assembly-line workers.

How does a chocolate covered spelt ball taste like? Exactly how you imagine it, I guess. It looks like a little brown chocolate ball, however, you can’t actually know what’s on the inside (if it wasn’t for the packaging, of course). It smells like chocolate, nuttily yet a bit peaty. The sound it makes if you drop it on a table is a hollow thud, most likely because of the spelt ball on the inside. I’m looking at the chocolate covered spelt ball and it reminds me of a quotation by Nietzsche: and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. I’m wondering what the spelt ball tastes like. I overcome my fear of an impending anaphylactic shock and put it in my mouth. The chocolate melts. Only the spelt ball is left, which tastes entirely bland. Such is life.

Das Zusammenleben mit meiner Freundin funktioniert immer noch gut. Hab diese Woche die letzten Sachen des Einzugs erledigt (z.B. mein Whiteboard angeschraubt). Wird langsam recht heimelig hier :)

Weiterhin hab ich Civ V unter dem aktuellen Ubuntu wieder zum laufen gebracht. Ich musste nur ein paar Dateien verschieben. Siehe [hier](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3273) für weitere Informationen.

Seit Freitag probieren wir Netflix aus und bisher kann ich's nur empfehlen. Auch wenn man nicht alle Serien (und wenn, dann nicht die aktuellsten Folgen) findet, so ist die Auswahl groß genug, dass man sich bis zur nächsten Inhaltserweiterung viel Zeit mit dem Schauen bisher unbekannter Serien vertreiben kann. So schauen wir gerade [Luther](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_%28Fernsehserie%29), welche ich auch nur empfehlen kann.

Ach ja: besonders gefreut hat mich diese Woche, dass die San Francisco Giants die World Series gewonnen haben. In unserem Urlaub waren meine Freundin und ich beim letzten Spiel der Saison der Giants und das war ein grandioses Erlebnis. Seitdem bin ich ein bisschen interessiert an Baseball.

rofl, don't tell me he sold that line domestically? http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4537912.stm This gives the number of 20% and obviously it wasn't for any opting out of CAP, since its stated to remain unchanged (albeit capped to the same amount irrespective of new accessions) in the next bullet point. This was also in response to French demands for removing the rebate completely. Now CAP was indeed reformed (again) at the end of the period. 

You think agreeing to a review of CAP implies an agreement to lower it or exclude UK? If this is what he's seeking, of course he'll fail to get there in that manner.

&gt; The UK fighting over the CAP 

certainly not. It has done far too much fighting over this or that, and predictably it led it nowhere.

&gt; The reality is that if something's a sacred cow to France and Germany, nothing will be done about it.

Certainly - CAP won't be just scrapped for sure; it has solid support - some UK exception from it is less unimaginable, but then you're talking treaty change here. Not only France, you have to appease (say) Luxemburg as well to get any traction here, for this requires unanimity, and ratification etc.

Anyhow if that seeems unlikely to succeed to you - good this is kinda my point; changes to movement of workers are significantly less likely. CAP at least knows exceptions - EEA nor Switzerland include CAP, nor fisheries, yet even there free movement of workers is mandatory.

BUT

looking at the reality it seems like they are the people that nag and complain a bit while not really being able to change things. Take for example the resolution to stop the ""Safe Harbour"" agreement with the USA, where in the end nothing happened. When I read about that resolution, I was really happy - but then I found out it would be nothing more than a ""strongly worded letter"" to the commission in the end.

Already this commission has started with the German guy proposing a blanket internet tax because ""the internet"" contains copyrighted material (and I doubt that this would mean we are allowed to share copyrighted material freely in the EU between each other as long as we pay the tax) for example. Another point are negotiations that are kept as secret as possible for as long as possible to ""not upset"" citizens.

So my questions are:

1. Should the European Parliament have more power over international agreements (e.g. to make the decision to cancel that ""Safe Harbour"" agreement instead of just demanding that it should be cancelled)? Would this even be a good thing or would this lead to more chaos (everybody wants to cancel this and that all the time and no work gets done)?

2. Would a very extreme ""no secrets"" transparency policy be feasible/possible? I doubt that it would be possible to ignore the EU in negotiations just because their new policy would be to ALWAYS negotiate in the open right from the beginning...

Ein Foto von Ghana oder ein Foto von mir? Ich bin ja so ein typischer User, der nicht ins Archiv guckt...

Ich war Montag wieder im Land mit den Waschmaschinen und Duschen!

Abenteuerlich.. Naja! Wie ich schon andeutete die Strassen sind sehr abenteuerlich, aber wenn ich das einfach so erzähle kommt das ziemlich schlecht rüber. Story time!


Also diese Geschichte nenne ich die

""Suche nach dem Internetcafé, bei Stromausfall""

Also stellt euch eine riesige glatte Fläche vor, dann schüttet überall unregelmäßig viel Roten Sand und Geschütt. Lass Autos daher fahren und Schlaglöcher und den Tod verewigen. 
Überall rennen Hühner, Ziegen, Schafe rum. Es gibt keine Regeln im Straßenverkehr. Wer bremst verliert. Die Leute haben Kampffreudigkeit. Und stellt überall Container hin und Zement Häuser die ihre stolze Zeit hinter sich haben. 
Die Sonne ist bereits Untergegangen und die Mosquitos unterwegs. Laila nahm keine Malaria Medizin weil sie zufaul war welche zu besorgen. Dann kennt sie sich kein bisschen aus, und die Strasse ist voll und viele Wagen fahren auf der Strasse. Motorradfahrer auf alten Englischen zerfallenen Maschinen sind überall. Tiefe Gassen am Rande des Sandweges wo eine fiese stinkendes etwas drin war, und viele Hühner ihren Tod fanden. 
Tja, jeder Mensch redet einen an. Frag Dinge, evlt. will Geld. Und man darf nicht nach dem Weg fragen sonst zocken die direkt einen ab, oder locken einen in eine Gasse. Sodass man nie wieder das Licht erblickt. Ein Bauarbeiter, den ich schon auf dem Schulgelände traf, wo ich lebte, war so nett mich etwas weiter weg zu führen zum Internetcafé. Mit ihm über die ""Strasse"" gehen, ging klar. Doch dann konnte ich das Dateiformat auf den mit Toolbar gesegneten XP Rechner nicht öffnen. Tja dann durfte ich alleine Heim finden, und wieder zum Internetcafé und diese ominöse Strasse zu oft überqueren. Ohne Witz, man ist dem Tod näher als man denkt. Viele Leute sprachen mich an. Autos hielten an wollten mich ""mitnehmen"". Aber ein ""i am busy, sorry"" hat an dem Tag geholfen. An anderen wiederrum nicht. Aber ich brauche viel zu lange für so n Text! Ein Eindruck reicht ja auch erstmal.

Niemand sagte ich sei gut im Geschichten erzählen. At least i tried! 

Mfg Laila

Its simply a matter of the level of integration of the market achievable. especially in non-tariff barriers to trade.

Having many different regulations and standards, or administrative procedures makes life difficult for producers and exporters and limits the level of integration.  Import procedures, however streamlined due to a FTA agreement, still make foreign goods less competitive. And possible discriminatory treatment of cross-border service providers is a fairly subtile matter, not solvable by a signature.

Single market harmonizes huge swats of such law, and has a high authority that persecutes noncompliance and creation of covert barriers or local business favoritism. It has some common regulatory bodies, such as the European Food Safety Authority imposing the same regulatory standard. VAT functions across state borders while internal taxation might otherwise make foreign products more expensive. It also has a focus and budget for  creation of interlinks of physical infrastructure (highway, rail freight, shipping, now energy interlinks etc). 

Further, treaty is static, while european single market continues to harmonize further areas (eg Single Market Acts I &amp; II in the last couple of years), be these recognised holes, or truly new areas of regulation (eg novel products, say in financial services or the digital economy)

&gt; “We support efforts to help low-income individuals get a fair chance based on their potential and individual merit; but we reject preferences, quotas, and set-asides, as the best or sole methods through which fairness can be achieved, whether in government, education or corporate boardrooms…Merit, ability, aptitude, and results should be the factors that determine advancement in our society.”

TL;DR  Republicans are against, not for affirmative action

I'm sarcasming because the usual UK policy is to blame all of society's ill on foreigners.

&gt; But no country can withstand a constant influx of garbage collectors, janitors and construction workers.

The US society was BUILT on immigrants. More working hands is an OPPORTUNITY, not a constraint, in my humble opinion. People working create far more value than they cost, on GDP level. And there's no shortage of needs of workers like teachers or garbage men. Except the ones with cash prefer keeping it in their pockets because they don't need all the roads maintained, only their own. So they buy a TV channel and repeat to everyone there's no need for any construction worker or garbage men or teachers, privatise the thing on gov money and fire 90% of the workers to just keep the entire payroll on their own bank account.

But really, what you have is a few billionaires who take millions on the back of their employers (watch how much garbage collection is billed a SINGLE STREET NUMBER. Generally about half. a. million. A. YEAR. Multiply it by every buildings in london. And you have but a hundred of people who do the entire town for a few nickels for the actual work that their employer makes litterally billions upon), give them scraps (1K/mo); then point a finger at a few foreigners then yell it's their fault the country is broke and that there is no money left, and that he can't pay workers more because ""there are too many people for too few jobs""; and while workers and foreigners are busy fighting each others said employer run away with millions and billions.

And you're too stupid to see that the issue isn't ""the lack of jobs"" or ""not enough cash in the society"" but a few robber barrons pitting people against each others to distract everyone from their own largescale theft (divide &amp; conquer). People are whining for 1000£ of welfare and all blaming each others of being ""freeloaders; there's not enough place for everyone on that lifeboat"" while banks and large corps *are getting TENS OF TRILLIONS in bailouts and get away with the entire cruise ship*.

You know where that ""foreigners are thiefs"" mentality come from ? It was created from scratch by medieval barons to prevent peasant revolt by pitting them against others and telling one group there wasn't enough cash for food for them by blaming another for stealing all the food and money.

Gut, dass du das auf Deutsch schreibst, so wird es mir sofort relativ klar! ;) (Mein Englisch reicht für solche Unterhaltungen im Grunde aus, aber so ist es doch noch deutlich einfacher!)

Ich glaube, es ist ungefähr das Gefühl, weswegen manche Leute auch Filme in der englischen Fassung lieber sehen als in der Deutschen, mal von schlechten Synchronsprechern abgesehen. Zumindest passt dieses Gefühl für mich sehr gut zu dem, was du da beschreibst.. ;)

Zum gestelztem Sound meiner Übersetzung: Meine Übersetzung klingt auf jeden Fall sehr förmlich, feierlich. Als ich es geschrieben habe, habe ich das langsam und bedächtigt vor mich hin gesprochen, was sich eigentlich sehr stilvoll anhörte, aber eben auch sehr konservativ. Heutzutage würde wirklich kaum jemand mehr von ""unglaublichem Glück"" reden, auch, wenn es wie ich finde sehr passend und immer noch völlig in Ordnung ist, so etwas zu schreiben! ;)

Aber ich verstehe vollkommen, was du meinst: Im Englischem kann man eine Eleganz im Klang und - ja, im Fluss - erreichen, die man im Deutschen nur sehr schwer erreicht. Ich glaube, dass ist auch der Grund, weshalb viele englische Muttersprachler die deutsche Sprache als so grobschlächtig empfinden: Solche Eleganz gibt es leider nicht 1:1 .. Ich glaube auch, dass, wenn man einen solchen Text übersetzt, es nur schwerlich möglich ist, diese Akustik so einzufangen, eben weil man durch die Übersetzung an eine gewisse Begrenzung in der Wortwahl gebunden ist.

Ich tue mich immer schwer damit, mich selbst zu loben, aber möglicherweise würde ich es schaffen, einen solchen Text zu schreiben, also mit stilvollerem/""eleganterem"" Klang. (Schreiben fiel mir eigentlich immer leicht.. :) ) Nur wollte ich bewusst das wiedergeben, was DoubtTheFuture geschrieben hat, eben, weil es das ist, was ER geschrieben hat und nicht irgendjemand bei reddit für Ihn, verstehst du, was ich meine? :)

Übrigens: Vielen Dank, dass du meine Übersetzung als gut bezeichnest, da ich weder professioneller Übersetzer bin, noch mein Englisch umwerfend gut ist, weshalb mich das schon etwas stolz macht! ;)

*What i wrote to Vertikal19:*

He said, that, when you read a text in english (or maybe some other language, too..) and then read a translation to german, you mostly will find some parts that were just perfect and nice in english and then again sound a little ... well... how to describe... they sound a little like you forced the meaning of it into another language, trying to keep it nice and accurate, but the elegance, the ""perfection"" in it, is lost.

I guessed that it's not really possible to translate a text from english to german with keeping this elegance and perfection, because you're bound to some sort of restriction in the vocabulary, in order to keep the meaning of the original text. It's generally harder to have this elegant sound in german, it's just harder to write a text that has this elegant sound and i think that's why most english-speaking people think of german as a rude-sounding language or why some people watch original versions of movies rather than the dubbed one...you know what i mean? That's why *""Auch dieses Jahr habe ich das unglaubliche Glück deinen Geburtstag zu erleben.""* sounds a little ...well...harder/more old fashioned? ... to vertikal, rather than *""I have been once again delighted by witnessing how you turn one more year.""*

Finally i stated that maybe I could write a text that has this intimate and elegant sound, because i always was pretty good in writing texts. (I'm *so* sorry for the self-praise!!) But i didn't want to write a new text on my own - i wanted to translate what DoubtTheFuture said in order to help him trying what HE wants to say in german, not letting him say what a completely stranger on reddit wrote for him.

Zehn Jahre nach seinem Hochschulabschluss wachte er schweißgebadet auf. 

Der Wecker schrillte ohrenbetäubend, mit einem Schlag auf den Kopf brachte er ihn zum Schweigen. Mit einem verschwommenen Blick erfasst er seine Umgebung. Der Raum kam ihm vertraut vor, „mein Zimmer“ geht es ihm durch den Kopf – natürlich war es sein Zimmer, was denn sonst.

Er stand auf und begab sich zum Bad. Auf der Tür stand auf einem Post-It: „Unterhosen nicht vergessen!“ Tatsächlich trug er keine Unterhose – wie praktisch diese Notiz sei, dachte er sich und zog sich an.

Er starrte ~~ihn~~ **in** den Spiegel und stellte mit bedauern fest, dass er sich nicht so ~~Alt~~ **alt** in Erinnerung hatte. Graue Barthaare besetzten sein Kinn, lange Falten zogen sich unter seinen Augen ~~hindurch~~ **entlang**.

Sein Magen knurrte und er entschied sich**,** in der Küche ein paar Spiegeleier zu braten. Auf dem Küchentisch lag ~~eine kleine~~ **ein kleines** Buch; „Ich ~~bein~~ **bin** dein Tagebuch, lies mich!“, stand auf einer aufgeklebten Notiz. Er konnte sich nicht erinnern**,** jemals ~~eine~~ **ein** Tagebuch geführt zu haben. Verwundert schlug er es auf der ersten Seite auf. 

Dort stand ~~folgendes~~ **Folgendes**: „Vor zehn Jahren hat sich dein Leben verändert, dieses Tagebuch enthält mehr als nur Erinnerungen, es ist deine Lebensgeschichte, pass gut darauf auf.“ Gleich darunter fand er seine Unterschrift. Komisch**,** er konnte sich nicht erinnern, dass er so etwas jemals geschrieben hat. Er blätterte bis zur letzten Seite, die noch ~~einem~~ **einen** Eintrag enthielt, dort [...] stand [in ~~siner Hand-Schrift~~ **seiner Handschrift**], dass heute Samstag sei, er nicht zur Arbeit gehen ~~darf~~ **dürfe** und um 12 Uhr seine Mutter zu Besuch komme.

Dass man an einem Samstag nicht zur Arbeit geht, leuchtete ihm ein, aber er war davon ausgegangen, dass der heutige Tag ein Montag ist, wie konnte er das nur vergessen.

~~1~~ **Eine** Stunde später klingelte es an der Tür und ein vertrautes Gesicht ~~tratt~~ **trat** ein. Es war seine Mutter, wie sie sich doch verändert hat. Mit einem kleinen Schmunzeln bemerkte sie wie froh sie sei, dass er heute nicht wieder zur Arbeit gegangen ist.

Seine Mutter drückte ihm einen Wochenplan, wie er ihn aus der Schulzeit kannte, in die Hand. „Der ist für nächste Woche“, k**l**ärte sie ihn auf, „prüfe den Plan jeden Abend und trage die Aufgaben jeweils für den nächsten Tag ein.“ Das ~~ganz~~ **Ganze** trug sie ihm mit einer leicht ~~genervt~~ **genervten** und montonen Stimme vor.

Den Rest des Tages verbrachte er mit einem Spaziergang um den See und einem Bier mit seinen Freunden wie er ~~sich, dass~~ **es** gewöhnt war.

Am Abend nachdem er die Aufgaben von seine**m** Wochenplan wie befohlen ins Tagebuch geschrieben hatte, schlug er es auf der zweiten Seite auf. Er war neugierig und wollte wissen warum er so ein Tagebuch führte. 

Er fand einen Text von seiner Mutter: „Zehn Jahre ist es her**,** mein Sohn. Im Jahr als du deinen Abschluss gemacht hast, bis**t** du auf der Fahrt nach Hause frontal mit einem Lastwagen kollidiert. An diesem Tag hast du dein Langzeitgedächtnis verloren, jeder Tag ist für dich ein Montag. Ich werde mich so lange um dich kümmern, bis es nicht mehr geht. Ich liebe dich**,** mein Sohn.“

Mit tränen in den Augen lag er im Bett, er konnte immer noch nicht glauben, was er gerade gelesen hat. Wie dankbar er seiner Mutter war. Der Schlaf erfasst**e** ihn und blies ihm den Tag aus dem Kopf.

I'm a student from germany, please let me help you out on this one:

* You can study at a normal university if you have an ""Abitur"". You can get the Abitur by finishing a ""Gymnasium"". (Ingoring ""special"" cases like the ""Abendschule"" - I'm talking about the common ways here.)
* You can study at a ""Fachhochschule"" if you have an ""Abitur"" or a ""Fachabitur"" - which you can get with one year less of school (""Gymnasium""), but often a practical year (""Jahrespraktikum"") is required. You can get a ""Fachabitur"" if you attend a ""Berufskolleg"", too.
* You can't study with the ""mittlere Reife"", but you can attend a ""Berufskolleg"" in order to get the ""Fachabitur"".

I'm studying in North Rhine-Westphalia and I don't know whether there additionally are some special rules and options in other federal states. But these are the basic options, which should apply to any university whatsoever in Germany. (""Faustregel"" ;) )

**Attention:** Some ""Fachhochschulen"" call themselves ""University"" in english - but they stay Fachhochschulen. The grades you achieve there are equal by law to the ones you get at normal universities. That means a ""Bachelor of Science"" that you got at a normal university is worth the same as a ""Bachelor of Science"" you got at a Fachhochschule.

In questo clima del ""Gay non è sbagliato"" che spazio ha chi con tutte le proprie forze non riesce ad accettarsi? E che spazio ha chi desidera aiutare queste persone? Gli psicologi tale spazio non lo hanno da tempo causa deontologia dell'albo... se si venisse a sapere di pratiche non accettate dall'ordine verrebbero espulsi. Ciò comporta che lo studio in tale ambito è cessato: ormai la prassi è elaborare il disagio per superarlo; come se si soffrisse di claustrofobia: una paura irrazionale da razionalizzare...

---

&gt;

&gt;__Kir__ is a popular [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) [cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail) made with a measure of [crème de cassis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_de_cassis) (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine).

&gt;In [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) it is usually drunk as an [apéritif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap%C3%A9ritif) before a [meal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal) or [snack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack). Originally the [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine) used was [Bourgogne Aligoté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgogne_Aligot%C3%A9), a lesser [white wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_wine) of [Burgundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_(region\)). Nowadays, various white wines are used throughout France, according to the region and the whim of the barkeeper. Many prefer a white [Chardonnay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardonnay)-based [Burgundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_wine), such as [Chablis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chablis_(wine\)).

&gt;Originally called __blanc-cassis__, the drink is now named after [Félix Kir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Kir) (1876–1968), mayor of [Dijon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon) in Burgundy, who as a pioneer of the [twinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_twinning) movement in the aftermath of the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War) popularized the drink by offering it at receptions to visiting delegations. Besides treating his international guests well, he was also promoting two economic products of the region. Kir initially allowed one of Dijon's producers of crème de cassis to use his name, but subsequently extended the right to their competitors as well. According to Rolland (2004),  the reinvention of blanc-cassis (post 1945) was necessitated by the German Army's confiscation of all the local red Burgundy during the war. Faced with an excess of white wine, Kir renovated a drink that previously was made primarily with the red.

&gt;Another explanation that has been offered is that Mayor Kir revived it during a year in which the ordinary white wine of the region was inferior and the creme de cassis helped to disguise the fact.

&gt;Following the commercial development of crème de cassis in 1841, the cocktail became a popular regional café drink, but has since become inextricably linked internationally with the name of Mayor Kir. When ordering a kir, waiters in France sometimes ask whether you want it made with crème de cassis ([blackcurrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackcurrant)), de mûre ([blackberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry)) or de pêche ([peach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach)).

&gt;The [International Bartenders Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bartenders_Association) gives a recipe using 1/10 crème de cassis, but French sources typically specify more; 19th century recipes for blanc-cassis recommended 1/3 crème de cassis, which modern tastes find cloyingly sweet, and modern sources typically about 1/5. Replacing the crème de cassis with blackcurrant syrup is discouraged.

1. Do you really think a random refugee from Africa can work as a teacher? 
2. Yes, the number of needed garbage collectors is finite. If it wasn't, there would be no unemployment in Europe, because everyone could always go to work as a fucking garbage man.

Au final tout le monde est parti vers 16h dans une petite rue en direction du Palais de Justice ou de la Préfecture.Je n'étais pas en tête et je suis arrivé seulement au moment où le cortège partait donc sur ce point je n'en sait pas plus.

Il y a eu de nombreux tags sur les murs des rues où l'on passait,avec les flics qui stationnaient sur les boulevards.Très vite ils ont chargés et gazés joyeusement et la manif s'est divisée en au moins deux groupes, environ 400 personnes sont arrivés au Palais de justice seulement.
Du coup il y a eu pleins de petits groupes un peu partout,avec des charges régulières des CRS et la Bac qui attrapaient les plus lents ou les plus téméraires.A savoir que le centre ville était blindés de passant, certains on suivit le mouvement d'autre observaient ou filmaient.
J'ai vu des arrestations assez violentes, des gazages de personnes qui n'étaient pas agressives et beaucoup de ""dommages collatéraux"" dans la foule.

Au niveau des dégâts il y a eu au moins deux banques d'attaquées et une agence immobilières plus quelques panneaux JC Decaux.Le centre a été quadrillé jusqu'en début de soirée, et tout rassemblement même pacifique était dispersé avec un usage massif de lacrymos (parfois à tir tendu) à la clef.Beaucoup de passant en ont souffert et ""les cagoulés"" ont parfois aidé les commerçants qui rangeaient en urgence en distribuant du sérum physiologique.
A préciser que le métro a été fermé en fin d'après-midi, beaucoup de gens se sont retrouvés coincés.

Je n'ai pas vu de lancer de cocktail molotov, ni d'acide.
Personnellement j'ai croisé trois manifestants blessés dont deux par des tirs de grenades lacrymos.

Add a bit of cornstarch to give the sauce a nice texture. (mix the cornstarch in a sample of sauce at first, until it's completely mixed, then put that in the rest of the sauce and stir).

Then you get some water to boil, put a bit of vinegar in it, make the water turn with a spoon and poach one egg at a time in there.

Core principles are actually pretty strong arguments, because these principles define the EU. The single market with its four key regulations had by far the most significant impact on Europe.

&gt; The single market is a ""core principle"" but it doesn't extend to the stuff we are good at, like services or banking

London basically dominates the European banking market and your government was smart enough to protect this sector against heavy regulation after the financial crisis of 2007. About the clearing houses issue let me say this: the ECB won't be able to put this policy in place since it's against common market rules.

Bemerkenswert ist an der Rede u.a., daß er die Probleme, die die USA in den vergangenen Jahren hervorgerufen oder verstärkt haben, deutlich benennt (z.B. Libyen, Syrien, Irak), aber gleichzeitig - anders etwa als Ahmadinejad oder Hugo Chávez - nicht dümmlich vom imperialistischen Satan bzw. Yankee redet, sondern stets die Bereitschaft zur Verhandlung und die Bevorzugung von einvernehmlichen Lösungen betont. Das Beispiel der Verhandlungslösung im Zusammenhang mit dem syrischen Giftgas ist zudem überzeugend.

Recht hat er beispielsweise auch, wenn er beklagt, daß der Weg über die UN von den USA nur dann gewählt wird, wenn deren Resolutionen ihnen passen, ansonsten aber ein eigener Weg eingeschlagen wird. In solchen Fällen würden die betreffenden Gremien auch gern als veraltet bezeichnet. Putin nennt hingegen UN und OSZE als wichtige Instrumente bzw. Institutionen internationalen Interessenausgleichs.

The current ruling party (PP) is way more scary with the 20 years of illegal financing, the hundreds of corruption cases, the connections with drug dealing, being funded by a former minister of information of the dictatorship that was in the Senate until 2011, confesional catholic(but fortunately refuses to illegalize gay marriage)...

I personally think that UPyD wouldn't be as bad as the PP if they have to play the role of conservative party. But I am finding hard to take them seriously, trying to play that role with a leader that was a former Socialist high officer. And she now wants derogate the special old fiscal status for the Basque Country when she(Basque) was in the Basque politics defended it also and was key to reestablish it with the Basque Nationalist Party(she even signed a coalition with them).  And then there is the lack of internal democracy, all the electoral list are elaborated or vetoed by the leader...

EDIT: I find funny how much some left wing Spaniards hate the parties that target the right wing voter usually. Even if Podemos has been doing some discourses to appeal to the decent people that are conservatives, but don't want their country ruled by criminals.

La ragazza con cui stavo aveva dei parenti all'interno, ed in un momento di insicurezza esistenziale si rivolge con interesse alla setta. Contro ogni previsione personale mi ritrovo a dover discutere seriamente di dogmi di fede che non trovo assolutamente condivisbili. Come dicevo nel post di apertura, l'esperienza è stata terribile ma sopportabile nel senso che non ci sono pericoli per la vita dell'adepto od il suo equilibrio finaziario; di converso mi sono trovato immerso in un mondo completamente dissociato dalla realtà condivisa dal resto dell'umanità, con un approccio noi/loro - dentro/fuori. 

Ho assistito alla messa in atto dei più triviali trucchi di convincimento partendo dalla paura della morte, spiegazione del dolore, spiegazione delle ingiustizie, in modo da assoldare a poco prezzo chi si trova in un momento difficile della propria vita, o parte da una condizione sociale disagiata, con la promessa di una comunità solida, sicura, chiusa.
 
Questo c'è di sicuro, bisogna ammetterlo: è una comunità solida, sicura, chiusa. 
Ho partecipato a matrimoni tra TdG, celebrazioni nella casa del regno, cene con adepti che ci arringavano sulle bellezze di questo mini mondo, da cui ho tratto un'educata avversione per questa setta. I problemi sono arrivati quando, dopo qualche mese, si è cominciato a capire che non ero un passivo gregario ma cercavo di condurre dei ragionamenti con gli adepti: a questo punto sono salito di livello e la personalità-di-spicco-della-comunità, uomo quantomeno viscido, ha iniziato una guerra psicologica di trincea le cui mire non erano difficili da comprendere.

Ho imparato un paio di cose:

* se non volete essere importunati dai TdG a casa, provate a chieder loro con ferma cortesia di togliervi dalle liste delle persone da importunare. Dovrebbero immediatamente desistere e non tornare più.
* Se non volete essere importunati dai TdG e siete meno rispettosi, avvicinatevi, date loro la mano, e dichiarate di essere stati voi stessi dei TdG. Guardate la reazione.
* State fuori da questa setta. Se ci siete dentro e volete parlarne, messaggiatemi in privato. Se ne siete a contatto e volete parlarne, messaggiatemi in privato.",0,1414962566,null,0,false,0,clr35ik,t3_2kw0rt,t1_clr35ik,t1_clpexq7,null,1426224547,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

To give some more detail, essentially its a little post-apocalyptic from an alternate history. In this history, the world culture formed differently than in our version. When technology reached the point of hitting an industrial revolution, it did so quickly and greatly. The world became very polluted at a rapid rate also, and toxic gases form in the atmosphere that begin to kill animals and plants, and making people very sick. The recent past in the book is from a culture similar to the formation of the Deutscher Bund in the 1800s, minus Christianity/Luthernism - in fact, there is a growing number of agnostics and atheists, but since religion isn't the primary focus, just something to help describe the culture, that's never really brought up. German scientists and engineers are able to save most of their people by elevating cities above the pollution, with farms and all, and creating new societies. Of course, they share what they know with other countries but they are already advanced, being the first. Some resources are left still on the ground where the pollution hasn't reached yet, and a war breaks out over control of these areas. Germany's Luftwaffe has superior Gliders (a basic precursor to airplanes) and they win, unifying the new city-states into one Empire under the Kaiser.

As some people already mentioned, the most likely Sections of the German Penal Code will be §§ 22 together with 33 KunstUrhG. That one carries a maximum penalty of 1 year of jail time.

I presume she is a first time offender? And obviously, she's a woman (women get a little less for the same offenses than men - *in general*, though not always). So I guess she will maaaaaybe be fined in the end after about a year of legal back and forth. If she takes on a good defense lawyer who knows his stuff (and he will almost certainly be more competent regarding the technical stuff than most prosecutors), it will be less.

*You* will have to testify and will know that all people in the room have seen those pictures of you and may even ask some uncomfortable and seemingly stupid questions.

I know that's an uncomfortable situation and don't want to discourage you, but what if nothing comes of it in the end? Or maybe the fine will just be laughable in your eyes? Your ex would have ""won"" once more.

So you have to ask yourself: Is it worth it? The internet already has those pictures, they won't be going away just because your ex paid a fine to the German state. I would go all out with abuse messages/takedown requests to the various services she uploaded those pictures to.

If you want to go through with the criminal charges side of things, I would advise you to go to a specialized Opferanwalt (victim lawyer) and ask him for advice, just to get a general idea if we're all wrong and there either is a really good chance your ex will be let off or will be charged and convicted.

My personal advice: Learn how to say, that you are unfluent in german and what languages you could offer. I'm always a bit confused, when someone asks me something in - for exampel - french and I'm just standing there like...umm... ""Je ne parle pas français?"" :-(

One more thing: Maybe you will hear sentences like ""I'm not against foreigners, but if they come here, they should speak german"". Well. I don't like those people. German is a really hard language to learn and sentences like that are said easily when you're a native speaker.

Ich habs jetzt geschafft! Vorsicht, mecker-Pfosten folgt:

Montag einfach mal beschlossen, dass ich keinen Bock mehr auf drei Seminare hab, weil der faule Bastard der ich bin, sich irgendwie zu fein für den Scheinerwerb ist. Abends dann noch nen Seminar ausgefallen, Kommilitonin hat meine Biereinladung abgelehnt. 

Dienstag wieder Uni, Seminar ausgefallen. Wollte mir dann ne Hose kaufen, aber ich bin anscheinend nicht nur zu fett, sondern hab auch noch zu kurze Beine für ne echte Hose. Damenbesuch für Essen und Film schauen am Abend hat abgesagt. Hat mich mehr geärgert als es sollte. 

Die restlichen Tage sind so irgendwie rumgegangen… Hab viel New Girl geschaut. Mein Türkisch-Kurs ging los, der war cool. Gestern dann noch mit zwei Freundinnen gemütlich Bier getrunken. War dann so viel (bei mir), dass ich heute den ganzen Tag im Bett lag und Haribo gefrühstückt hab.

Bin dann grade zum Papa gegangen, was essen. Total verkatert mit erweiterter Verwandtschaft, weil meine Großtante anscheinend gestorben ist. Für mich nicht dramatisch, ich kannte die Frau praktisch nicht. Habs dann zum Glück doch geschafft irgendwie drei Bier zu trinken, um das gelegentliche Schweigen bissi zu brechen.

Naja, morgen muss ich alles nachholen, was ich heute hätte machen sollen. Zwei Geburtstage stehen an und wahrscheinlich wie gewohnt ne Menge Selbstmitleid…

Hoffentlich bei euch alles besser, ich les mich hier jetz mal durch!

If you look into the history of the union, one's concerns were always taken serious. If Germany and France would give a fuck about what UK thinks about banking regulation, the City of London would be a desert now. It always seems to me as UK thinks it's the center of the universe and if they fart all Europe should have a stomach problem. UK already has deductions and advantages but it's still not enough. Meanwhile continental Europe thinks UK tries to squeeze out while taking the advantages of the EU without giving any sacrifice.

The EU is created as a subsidiary union. I don't get why Brits think the EU is a centralistic monster.

Parties change positions and mentalities all the time, they adapt to new situations and use new approaches, it's been happening all over the world in the past 40 years. The fact that parties are converging on the middle ground is a sign of more inclusion and less divergent policies, if you can't find what you're looking in the middle chances are your views are already too extreme to be healthy for the widespread society, and a healthy democracy is much more than just voting, much, much more.

&gt;This is typical gay-obsessed Russian frustration.


I don't give a shit about anyone being gay, but what i do give a shit about is deliberate misleading campaigns engineered by 3rd parties, which has nothing to do with reality on the ground. This was a clear example of piece of shit journalism during Arab spring being taken for a ""face value"" by gullible people, a *clear case of manipulation and misrepresentation*. People write about Putinbots, they should also consider that other factions are engaged in all sorts of PsyOps and informational war. 


Do i need to remind you about reddit numbers from American Air base or something? It was reported repeatedly and to think that nothing ""funny"" is taking place after all the Snowden and NSA bullshit is beyond silly.


&gt;I fail to see how you've provided convincing arguments so far why not.


There is a Russian saying ""Одна бабка сказала"" which roughly translates as ""One old woman said"" with everything that comes after, which describes mostly rumors and hear-says, generally an impossible to verify source of information. 


&gt;Witness testimony reporting, like journalism has been conducted for more than a hundred years.


Who is a witness? What is his credentials? What makes you think that mr.Matsuka has not made them up in his head to give his words legitimacy? 


In an age of disinformation, viral marketing, manipulations of data and constant propaganda campaigns, ""eyewitness report"" become a whole lot less valuable in terms of giving accurate information from the ""locals"". 


Everyone have a phone with a camera nowadays, where is video, a picture, anything besides a couple lines on twitter? You can cover face, change voice,  there are a ton of things you can do , but i am supposed to ""take your word for it""? Why? What makes you so ""trustworthy""? 


&gt;That fact that things happen more than once doesn't mean that somebody who is reporting it is ""repeating"" things.


No it isn't, but the contents of the ""news"" looks more like ""adding constant fuel to the fire"", rather than investigative journalism or reporting from the locals. There is a clear benefactor in such campaign, who has been repeatedly caught in the past doing so with all sorts of bullshit including Nuclear strikes. 


Its also funny to read about coal deliveries by cargo trucks to Russia when a lot of Donbass mines are flooded (not even saying anything about the economic viability of such deliveries) or sunflower seeds in fucking November. Where the fuck did they found it **in NOVEMBER** is beyond me. 


&gt;You wouldn't know what journalism is, unfortunately.

Our leadership wasn't responsible for any of this.

&gt; NATO moving east is probably just a pretext

Before the Second World War, many of the countries in the former Warsaw Pact were independent. After the war, they found themselves under brutal Soviet rule. When they were freed from Soviet clutches, the first thing they wanted is to be shielded from future invasions or geopolitical meddling. So they requested NATO membership, and NATO obliged. The Baltic States would have little prospect of survival without NATO.

&gt; but what use did we really have for moving NATO into the old East block? 

Thanks to countries like Poland, we gain millions more potential conscripts who are bound by article 5 to protect us. And we them.

In the end, this allegiance was setup after WWII to deter invasion, by unifying its member states into a military bloc with mutual defense clauses. It's not that complicated of a concept, actually.

&gt; Instead of incorporating into NATO, couldnt we have pacted those countries.

That's not what those countries wanted, and for good reason, we see now.

&gt; Also, presumably, when the USSR fell, basically a new(ish) government was set up. Not sure what sort of influence the West had on it, but it didnt work out.

No, I don't think we should have meddled with that, you're right. Naomi Klein discusses this in ""The Shock Doctrine"".

I cannot see it decreasing their power at all. Especially if they do sign various free-trade agreements with the EU (which they surely would).

Uhm, I'm not so sure. Immigration is a rather new thing here. In Spain it didn't start until the mid-80s. Apart from that, our immigration tends to have some different characteristics. Most non-Spaniard people in Spain are first generation immigrants (second generation, tops, and in this case they are all very young), they have their own nationalities from their countries of origin and preferred to be called by them. 

Most immigrants in Spain, unlike the US, do not stay for ever. It is known that Africans tend to come alone (young single males, usually) and move through Europe and that Latin Americans usually return to their countries after some years. Only some stay and have children. Only in the last decade it has become common to see non-Spaniard children in schools, mostly Latin Americans. I attend a public university in a very populated region  and on my faculty I've only seen *one* black guy, no more. It is all very recent.

Thus, most people stick to their original nationalities. So do their children, because in Spain you don't get the citizenship for being born here. People are then used to called them by their nationalities, is not so much about PC.

&gt;you're not expected to give up your old culture and integrate into ""American"" culture (to an extent anyway), you're expected to add yourself to the ""melting pot"".

Multiculturalsm, so far, is not working the same way in Europe as it is in the US exactly for this reason. As most European countries are made up by fairly homogenous populations or pre-established populations (in the case of Spain: Catalans, Basque, Castilians, etc.), the immigrant population cannot fit right in, as they are not part of the already established groups.

As for feeling like a superpower, I think that partly explains why the British political class emphasise the importance of the Anglo-American alliance and being the US' number one ally. Agree with it or not, they believe Britain's role in the world is projected by allying closely with the US. Strangely, they don't see Britain's role being projected when Britain works closely with its European partners, even though it does so in other organisations (see NATO, Council of Europe and the OSCE).

Yeah, by switching their position on every issue depending on whether they're in power or in the opposition.

&gt; The fact that parties are converging on the middle ground

They aren't. Most have no real affiliation except on paper. PSD is no more central now than 10 years ago and PNL is no more central now than 10 years ago.

&gt; if you can't find what you're looking in the middle chances are your views are already too extreme to be healthy for the widespread society

I'm not sure you understood my point at all. I WOULD vote for the center-left if they weren't so sleazy. My whole point was that I can't vote for them, not because of a difference in ideas on paper, but because of corruption and all sorts of foul play in practice.

Everything you say is as if you're responding to someone complaining that there's no extreme left and right, whereas I wasn't anywhear near suggesting that. I'm saying it's bad that parties have no actual agenda whatsoever, it's all done on the fly depending on what's good for the party, rather than following any coherent set of thoughts.

mini series: 

- ""un gars une fille"" (with Jean Dujardin, actor from The Artist. It's a short program (5 min/episode) about the everyday life of a french couple. It's quite funny and realistic.) 

- ""Bref"" (but they speak really fast so that will probably be difficult and I doubt you'll find subtitles, but maybe they exist) (It's difficult to explain, it's about the life of a 30 year old guy, who meeets ""this girl"". It's very modern, very funny, well made, but with a lot of references you may not understand) 


- ""Kaamelot"" (many french people are crazy about it, I personnally never really got it, but I thought I would mention it. I don't think that's really what you're looking for though. It's another short program, about the King Arthur.)


- (""Soda"") (a short program about a 16/17 year old guy and his friends, but I think I speak for everyone here if I say I don't watch it because I find it really bad, not realistic and not funny. The guy seems to be quite successful though so there are obvioulsy people who enjoy it.)


or try french youtubers, the most popular ones being:

-Norman

-Cyprien

french series:

- **""Fais pas ci, fais pas ça""** I think it's the one that resembles the most what you are after. It's the series that inspired the creators of Modern Family. It's quite different but basically it's about two french families, they are neighbors, one is a conservative right-wing family while the other is the left wing ""bobo"" type. I find it quite entertaining, there are  teenagers and young adults who sound like are really living in 2014 France, which is very rare! Other than that I can't think of another french tv series like gossip girl or vaguely similar.


- ""Plus belle la vie"" It's a very successful daily series. It's set in a neighbourhood of Marseille (though all the actors are parisians, so no one even has a southern accent!). So you'll see people of all ages, including teenagers and young adults. The way they talk is quite realistic to be honest, but I don't watch it, as probably most redditors here, since the stories are often very unrealistic (they need to find stuff to fill daily 20 minutes episodes so there are quite a lot of murders), but they do try to sound realistic. It's not working for me, but that's probably a funny thing to watch when you're trying to learn the language. (There are a lot of characters though, so it will probably take you some time to figure out who is who).

- many series produced by canalplus: they are the best french series we have currently. But they are not what you are looking for. I had to mention them, in case you haven't heard of ""braquo"", ""engrenages"", ""les revenants"", ""mafiosa"", ""maison close"", ""pigalle la nuit"" etc..

There are a lot of french series, by TF1 or france télévisions, but no one I know watches them, they are not realistic at all, and quite badly produced. 

Otherwise, yes you'll be able to find the french versions of gossip girl, friends, the big bang theory, how I met your mother, desperate housewives etc etc quite easily via torrent.

Its really quite incredible to undermine the controversy surrounding Romania/Bulgaria entering, which (although legally absolutely perfect), caused issue across Western Europe.

First, Schengen doesn't equal the freedom of movement policy. Schengen is a separate treaty which isn't even bound to the EU. It's a multilateral treaty among European nations. Bulgaria and Romania haven't been granted full access so far because the member states are seeing issues not yet solved such as corruption and border security at the external border.
The freedom of movement of workers had the same timeframe as the 2004 entered countries were bound to. The 7 year transition was used in 2004 as well as in 2007.

&gt;The PVV lost popularity (rightly) because of some horrific comments Wilders made. But again, their rise is very indicative of growing resentments in The Netherlands.

So they lost population for their right wing bullshit but are still a growing problem. Of course they are a problem, but they are a minorty. Opposition to European policies isn't any new to Europe.

&gt;And as for the FN, citing Hollande's failures is again very naive. Le Penne has been very very vocal regarding treatment of Roma for example.

It's not naive, it's actually polls which tell my the cold numbers. Of course they are racist fuckheads, no doubt. They have been a way more openly racist party under the rule of daddy Le Penne.

No one's going to attack Russia. You don't need buffer states. If Russia weren't so aggressive there wouldn't be a weapons escalation in Eastern Europe, and Russia would be perfectly safe. 

By all means, it can protect its economic interests and special relationships with neighbors, but I feel this could be best done if Russia tries to be liked by its neighbors, rather than feared. Fear just drives its neighbors closer to the EU and NATO, and then Russia complains. If it opened itself to a friendlier relationship, it could be a special partner of the EU, and would profit economically. We'd buy its gas and resources without thinking twice about it, we'd send more students there to learn Russian, and we'd include it more openly in international affairs...

Some people say that in order for Russia to survive considering its size and regional diversity it needs a dictatorship-like rule. I don't think that's necessarily the case. Sure, there may be more separatism under a moderate democracy, but democracies have managed to deal with that sort of thing, like Canada with Quebec, or even like France with a fairly strong presidential republic whose identity is based around a Republic one and indivisible. Russia is a federation of autonomous republics, and this could be accepted as a good deal by the regions. Now sure, places like Chechnya may be more of a violent problem, and Russia would get international condemnation for trying to quell separatism, but it would still be better for its image than bullying everyone and appearing to be an unflinching quasi-dictatorship. Defending its internationally recognized borders and sovereignty is, ultimately, according to international law, justifiable.

2. Independence will benefit no one, and hurt many. The right ""To choose"" only goes as far as you are not invading someone elses freedoms. Forcing you to speak 1 language, forcing you to relocate or in any case kick you from your country should not be in their hands.

3. The public is not well informed. Most means of communication here have very strong state influence, I feel that people are trying to be used as a battering ram to bring down the constitution. This is reinforced by the fact that media advertising budgets of the Catalan government are the last thing getting slashed in terms of spending (Spending increased in the middle of the recession, while education and healthcare got cut down)

4. Catalonia is one of the most corrupt regions in Europe, I feel that this is some kind of crazed forwards escape by our politicians (See Pujol corruption case, the considered father of modern catalan nationalism)

Sicuramente meglio del ""scommetto che tu venderesti tua Madre per 80€"" (Nota a parte, visto che me lo devo tirare: se gli 80€ fossero confermati per il 2015, probabilmente non li prenderei perché sono oltre la soglia massima. /r/firstworldproblems)

Ora occupiamoci dell'immagine, punto per punto:

* **Legge elettorale non costituzionale**: Premetto che il Porcellum è una vaccata stratosferica, e qui sono d'accordo. Detto questo, la corte costituzionale ha stabilito che solo parte del Porcellum è incostituzionale, è che il parlamento attuale è da considerarsi legittimo, come scritto anche nei due link da te postati. Quindi possiamo dire al massimo che è una mezza verità, scritta soprattutto per gridare allo scandalo.

* **Parlamento fatto da parlamentari non scelti dai cittadini**: Anche qua, mezza verità. Il cittadino ha votato per una lista di parlamentari, poi il partito ha scelto chi mandare in parlamento fra questi. Una schifezza? Assolutamente d'accordo (tralasciando il fatto che nella maggior parte delle schede la preferenza viene lasciata in bianco o e nulla, vedasi l'elezione europea) ma dire ""non scelti dai cittadini"" è un'esagerazione.

* **Presidente della Repubblica non rieleggibile**: Non ci perdo tempo, [basta leggersi l'articolo 85 per vedere che nulla vieta di rieleggere lo stesso presidente due volte.](https://www.senato.it/1025?sezione=128&amp;articolo_numero_articolo=85) Adesso, anche a me piacerebbe vedere ""carne fresca"", ma questo è un'altro conto.

* **Appoggiato da un'alleanza non votata da nessuno**: E qua purtroppo entra in gioco la mia ignoranza politica. Essendo giovincello ho iniziato a seguire semi-seriamente la politica da poco, quindi non so esattamente di che alleanza stia parlando. Ma immagino stiamo parlando nuovamente di parlamentari non eletti dai cittadini, quindi vedi la risposta sopra.

* **Nome non presente sulle schede elettorali**: Vero, nulla da dire su questo. Il problema? Che non è un problema. Il presidente del consiglio viene eletto dal parlamento, non direttamente dai cittadini, e non è necessario che il suo nome sia su una scheda parlamentare, o che faccia parte di una qualsiasi lista. Puoi non essere d'accordo, e rispetto la tua opinione, ma non puoi usare questo fatto per parlare di ""colpo di stato"".
P.s. questa è un'arma a doppio taglio. Dicendo una cosa del genere porti dalla tua parte gente che non se ne intende di politica, che si indigna ma non si informa. Ma allontani gente che si informa è sa che tutto quello che è successo è a norma di legge.

* **Che aveva giurato**: Una su tante sembra effettivamente vera. La solita aria fritta che a tutti i politici/partiti piace dire. Ora, il fatto che lo facciano tutti non lo scusa di sicuro, ma rende ""l'accusa"" meno grave.

* **P2, Colpo di stato**: Qua si entra nel mondo oscuro di complotti &amp; supposizioni. Un mondo che, onestamente, non mi sento di voler entrare. Uno può credere quello che vuole, sta di fatto che non ci sono prove che Renzi sia compandato dagli ex-P2 o simili.

* **Un senato di immuni non eletti**: Partiamo dall'immunità: grosso modo è esattamente la stessa immunità presente ora, quindi come per la maggior parte degli altri punti ""tecnicamente è vero, ma praticamente non è nulla per cui bisognerebbe gridare allo scandalo"". 
Per il ""non eletti dai cittadini"", bisogna dire che il senato perde gran parte del suo potere, e viene ridotto a una sorta di ""via di mezzo"" fra regioni e stato. Come idea secondo me non è neanche malaccio, anche se io personalmente lo avrei eliminato completamente. Insomma, tiene lo stesso nome ma diventa un'altra cosa.

* **Aumentano le firme necessarie per un referendum**: Non riesco a vederla come una cosa troppo negativa. Prima di urlare, aspetta: trovo solo naturale che il quorum salga al salire della popolazione (anzi, fosse per me sarebbe proprio in relazione a quest'ultima). Comunque, se quanto leggo in giro è vero (http://www.ilpost.it/2014/08/08/come-nuovo-senato/) alla fine il quorum per il referendum abrogativo non è stato toccato.

* **Un capo della maggioranza che controlla anche la magistratura**: Questo proprio mi sfugge, perché sarebbe cosi?

&gt; It's obviously stupid to say that 1.7 billion = 12.9 billion.

I never said he said that 1,7 billion = 12,9 billion. I said that he said that 1,7 billion is comparable to 12,9 billion, which is wrong.

The percentages might be correct, but this guy actually said:

&gt; A £1.7 billion recalculation for the EU budget would be like a £12.9 billion recalculation for the UK government budget.

Which is wrong. Indeed, the EU budget's size is only 13% of the UK's budget, that percentage is correct, but this does not mean the EU's demand of the UK is comparable to a 12,9 UK demand of it's people.

The UK has to pay 1,7  billion. No matter what size the EU budget is, this 1,7 billion is not comparable to the UK demanding any amount from it's people.

But the state? I can't see anything happening in the near future that would make me like it, at least not anything that I find very possible to happen. Without the rather idealistic things I'd obviously want to see (legalizing gay marriage, stop being ridiculously patriotic, lessen the power of the highly conservative church etc.), I guess the best things for now would be:

1) Being less aggressive towards the rest of the world, especially the West (but also neighbouring countries elsewhere). No kidnappings (the business with that Estonian is pissing me off like hell), no ridiculous showing off with planes and ships. Less propaganda. And for fuck's sake, no taking land from other countries.

2) Giving back Crimea. I know this won't happen. But nothing else would help as much right now.

3) Taking steps, however small and slow, towards a more democratic society. No discrimination of members of opposition, journalists etc. People should be let to demonstrate freely. More independent media. More possibilities for Russian people to hear different views and perspectives (also foreign ones) and compare them. Less antagonizing of the West.

4) Social reforms. Seriously, the situation of poor/middle-class people in Russia, especially in rural areas, is, judging by everything I know, terrible.

5) Better conditions for the non-ethnically-Russian citizens in general, and regional minorities/ethnic groups/semi-autonomous areas.

6) Trying to fix the economy. Seriously. The situation seems to pretty fucked up and the current politics certainly aren't helping.

Now, this list is completely subjective and I'm by no means an expert on any of these matters. This could also be a lot more progressive, but I tried to keep it as ""realistic"" as possible. I hope I'm not sounding like an entitled asshole that ""knows"" how to fix Russia, but if any of the aforementioned things happened, it really would make me a bit happier. At the moment I'm almost as concerned about how the current situation is affecting Russian people, as I am with it affecting Europe. I have people in Russia that I care about, and I'm very worried about them.

false,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt;Non mais en France oui, vu que les musulmans ne sont pas en terre musulmane

Le but est justement que la France devienne une terre musulmane.

&gt; Par contre, ça change rien au fait que l'Islam est quand même politique, il suffit de lire le Coran, c'est même pas discutable...

Il suffit de lire le Coran pour voir que c'est une menace pour la France (entre autres hein, je ne parle pas de la misogynie ou des constantes incompatibilités entre le Coran et le droit français). 

Simplement par respect pour les musulmans qui font la part des choses et choisissent de ne pas appliquer le Coran en dehors de leur vie privée, je distingue musulman et islamiste, donc je distingue islam et islamisme.

Écoute je ne peux que te conseiller le travail de Tocqueville, repris [ici](http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/De_tocqueville_alexis/notes_sur_le_coran/tocqueville_notes_coran.pdf).

En particulier la [sourate du repentir](http://islamfrance.free.fr/doc/coran/sourate/9.html) est [l'avant dernière sourate](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Chronological_Order_of_the_Qur%27an) et comme dans le coran les dernières sourates abrogent les plus anciennes, elle a abrogé 122 versets pacifiques.

[Ici une autre traduction en anglais](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/The_Holy_Qur%27an:_At-Taubah_(Repentance\)), pour éviter les différences d'interprétation.

28. Ô vous qui croyez! Les associateurs ne sont qu'impureté : qu'ils ne s'approchent plus de la Mosquée sacrée, après cette année-ci . Et si vous redoutez une pénurie, Allah vous enrichira, s'Il veut, de par Sa grâce. Car Allah est Omniscient et Sage.

29. Combattez ceux qui ne croient ni en Allah ni au Jour dernier, qui n'interdisent pas ce qu'Allah et Son messager ont interdit et qui ne professent pas la religion de la vérité, parmi ceux qui ont reçu le Livre, jusqu'à ce qu'ils versent la capitation par leurs propres mains, après s'être humilies .

30. Les Juifs disent : ""Uzayr est fils d'Allah"" et les Chrétiens disent : ""Le Christ est fils d'Allah"". Telle est leur parole provenant de leurs bouches. Ils imitent le dire des mécréants avant eux. Qu'Allah les anéantisse! Comment s'écartent-ils (de la vérité)?

31. Ils ont pris leurs rabbins et leurs moines, ainsi que le Christ fils de Marie, comme Seigneurs en dehors d'Allah, alors qu'on ne leur a commandé que d'adorer un Dieu unique. Pas de divinité à part Lui! Gloire à Lui! Il est au-dessus de ce qu'ils [Lui] associent.

32. Ils veulent éteindre avec leurs bouches la lumière d'Allah, alors qu'Allah ne veut que parachever Sa lumière, quelque répulsion qu'en aient les mécréants.

33. C'est Lui qui a envoyé Son messager avec la bonne direction et la religion de la vérité, afin qu'elle triomphe sur toute autre religion, quelque répulsion qu'en aient les associateurs.

34. Ô vous qui croyez! Beaucoup de rabbins et de moines dévorent, les biens des gens illégalement et [leur] obstruent le sentier d'Allah. A ceux qui thésaurisent l'or et l'argent et ne les dépensent pas dans le sentier d'Allah, annonce un châtiment douloureux,

35. le jour où (ces trésors) seront portés à l'incandescence dans le feu de l'Enfer et qu'ils en seront cautérisés, front, flancs et dos : voici ce que vous avez thésaurisé pour vous-mêmes. Goûtez de ce que vous thésaurisiez.""

Ça me parait assez clair comme menace.

&gt;Tu dis ça parce que tu pars du principe que la politique EST fondamentalement laïque, ce qui n'est pas le cas.

Non, je pars du principe qu'une religion relève forcément du privé.

&gt;Ca rejoint d'ailleurs ""la conception occidentale d'une religion"" dont on s'en fout en fait puisqu'on parle d’événements qui ont lieu en Orient.

La montée du radicalisme a aussi lieu en France, et non on ne s'en fout pas car la France a des intérêts avec de nombreux pays musulmans, et est sévèrement touchée par la remise en question du droit français par certains musulmans radicaux.

&gt;The __Champ de Mars__ (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɑ̃ də maʁs]; English: Field of Mars) is a large public [greenspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_open_space) in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), located in the [seventh *arrondissement*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7%C3%A8me_arrondissement,_Paris), between the [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower) to the northwest and the [École Militaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Militaire) to the southeast. The park is named after the [Campus Martius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Martius) (""Mars Field"") in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome), a tribute to the [Latin name of the Roman God of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology\)). The name also alludes to the fact that the lawns here were formerly used as drilling and marching grounds by the French military.

However, it would then still have to have its laws compatible with EU regulations - another driving force behind Euroskepticism. If the UK wanted to remain in the EEA, it would still have to hear Brussels's nagging it dreads so much.

If the UK left altogether, several of its industries may severely contract due to the elimination of an entire free trade area from its prospects.

[Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschulreife) says this:
&gt;Die Fachhochschulreife ist ein gehobener Bildungsabschluss, der zum Studium an einer Fachhochschule berechtigt. In wenigen Bundesländern Deutschlands berechtigt das entsprechende Abschlusszeugnis auch zur Aufnahme eines Bachelor-Studiengangs an einer Universität.

*The Fachhochschulreife is a higher grade of education, which gives the owner the right to study at a Fachhochschule. In a few federal states (Bundesländer) this grade gives the owner also the right to study at a university in a bachelors course.*

I also did a quick google-tour and [found](http://www.gutefrage.net/frage/kann-man-mit-fachabitur-an-einer-uni-studieren-) a post, that states that someones can also study at a university with the ""Fachabitur"" - in Marburg, Hessen.

----

I don't know whether that's correct, it sounds like one of those special rules i related to in my original post. But let me give you this advice: IF you want to try to attend a university with a ""Fachabitur"", it's an exception from the rule of thumb. **Anyway** you should precisely make clear that this is possible. As the words themselve say a **Fach**abitur gives you the right to study at a **Fach**hochschule. I'm not saying that everything else is impossible, but that's what should be the effective rule at **most** universities. I think it's also possible that only one particular bachelor course can be attended that way while the rest of the courses of a university are restricted to the ""normal"" Abitur.

Let me give you another advice, which comes from my own experience: I made the normal ""Abitur"" some years ago. And i decided, that for me, it would be better to study at a Fachhochschule and let go of the regular universities. The degree I'll have is worth the same and Fachhochschulen are way better now than they were in the past. Besides that, they get more popular year by year and sometimes there is even an discussion to give them the last university-exclusive right they don't have yet: The right to award someone a doctorate. So you shouldn't think of the Fachhochschulen as lesser universities. They are - in my opinion - just another way to learn stuff. And after all, i can proudly state, that i made the right decision: I'm very happy with my Fachhochschule! ;)

Right, please do tell me about the great wonders of the Armenian education system and about how objective it is...

Yeah I've read that Wiki article as well and I find it debatable. There is a pretty nifty cult of personality around George Washington in the USA if you ask me.

&gt; and almost all Turkish people have learnt and still accept a version of 1915's events that is not accepted by the majority of historians and scholars.

Most Turkish people don't really know or give a crap. Those who do care come with many different arguments. I'm not going to argue those with you here.

 
&gt; There's even a law that is enforced to this day that prevents insulting ""Turkishness"".[2]

No argument there, personally I think that is mentally challenged as well.


&gt; Ataturk is practically a demigod in your country. 
Depends on your definition of demi-god I guess. Many people admire and respect the man, we however do not believe he was anything more than human.


&gt; Nobody in the modern first world should be so universally admired, displayed and deemed infallible.

Except you forgot that there was a promise not to expand NATO eastward, and it is nearly *eight* years before poland got included, and some of the other Baltics are only being included now. The reason they are under threat might well be due to deterioration of the relationship.

Really, i cant argue well why i think the establishment here didnt handle Russia. That is my general sense, their lack of clear stance and option to the Russians to retreat is one reason, the whole debacle with the Russian-Dutch year another.

Jobs are actually quite hard to get. Most publishers have their go-to translators and keep them. Some of them are writers themselves. 

Regarding the price, you get 6 cents when you're lucky and have some reputation. Most literature translators will never get more than 2 cents. A good translator can deliver 2000 to 2500 quality words per day, or about 40 euros per day or 5 euros per hour BEFORE tax. After tax it's about 3 Euros per hour. I order to pay my bills I need to make at least 11 euros an hour and that is just to break even. 

One big problem is that there are agencies in Asia and Eastern Europe that flood the low end market with bullshit translations. They can offer translations for less than 2 cents, have minimal quality control and the publishers don't give a flying Fuck. 

The first Harry Potter books in German were a good example. The first batch was so bad, at one point they mixed up Harry with Ron. I'm not kidding. When the books were more successful in the UK and us the publisher had to get the books to be retranslated from scratch.
