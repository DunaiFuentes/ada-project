Not a Moron (on this topic anyway) he has a very difficult game to play, if he stays out of the debate then it would be argued that he is showing his lack of care about what happens, if he actively joins in he'll get steamrolled by Salmond, he's a *very* able politician and has spent his entire life preparing for this debate, he knows his stuff on the issue, Cameron by definition of having a wider range of responsibilities has a much more limited knowledge of the arguments etc.

at the moment he is putting his opinion across and getting his ministers to do the same, since they are doing it in a ""i'll tell you what I think format"" this is being described as lecturing the Scots.

So Cameron and the tories have a difficult game to play oerall.

as for Salmond being constantly wrong... maybe i'm biased (yes voter here) but watching all the debates, news reports etc. Salmond/SNP will make an argument, No will dismiss it out of hand, 3 months later it's the accepted opinion on both sides and the No camp insist that they never said x was impossible just difficult. Salmond's not an idiot and he gets a lot right, he wouldn't be leader of a majority government with overall positive opinion polling if he were incompetent.

and as someone else said, Braveheart comes up all the time, but it's not anyone in Scotland mentioning it, it's the British press referencing ""Braveheart Nationalism"" constantly.

a) you don't need that much money. aim for 1500€ to be safe and you'll probably won't have any worries. 

b) may, june is good but aim for the spring or fall. avoid the summer as it's incredibly hot and the 'camino' is full. I did my own in march and the smaller number of persons made it much incredibly better. Also, you don't have to arrive before noon to get a bed in the albergue!

c) you could get the pilgrim passport on the first city/albergue you started on. I doubt it's still a requirement but i remember taking a 'presentation letter' from my local catholic priest because it was mentioned. I don't think it was ever necessary though.

d)i got my walking stick in day 3 or4 from a basque guy that used to hand them over. you can take a 'modern' version from any sport store but to be honest i loved the whole 'somebody gave me a olive staff to walk'. Also, he gave me a shell to wear around my neck. Can't remember his name though.

e) don't insist on clothes and socks. 2 changes of clothes is more than enough and and 3 or 4 changes of socks. Remember that you'll carry this all day long, every day in the week, while walking, climbing and going down hills. Aim your backpack to 10 to 15 kils max! I'm a big guy and even i had to 'dial back' on what i took with me and sent stuff home by mail in Pamplona.

f) updated Maps with the albergues and contacts is a very necessary stuff. Even with mobile phones and gps, having stuff that doesn't run on electricity is mandatory. I bought a couple of books then. Search amazon or the websites for a recommmend version. My book had detachable maps with each day route and i used to carry those in my jacket. very useful!

g) right about the hygien and blister stuff. You'll have blisters!. a lotof them! don't overdo on the hygien though. again, you'll have to carry it so no 20 bottles of something and no matter what you'll do, you'll stink. Don't worry is pefectly natural...  ( [botafumeiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botafumeiro) ) I used to carry a simple soap bar that i used from everything since body to face to hair to clothes... but then again, i was young and reckless! you probably don't need to go that extreme route!

h) do it. It was my best decision ever. And it is **THE** defining moment of my life. More than anything else, that experience changed me beyond recognition. In my life there is *before the Camiño* and *after the Caminño*. 

I'm  considering going back to a second time. If i save enough money as well and have the time, maybe we'll meet!

[Incense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense) is burned in this swinging metal container, or ""[incensory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censer)"". The name ""Botafumeiro"" means ""smoke expeller"" in [Galician](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language).

Russian government, however, not only refuses to recognize many of their shameful events (for example, occupation of the Baltics), but also demonstrates that they are proud of their Soviet past, which brutally killed at least 20 million people and ruined the lives of many more. Almost every Lithuanian family has at least one member who was tortured, deported to Siberia/GULAGs or killed by the communist terror machine. And now people who had their parents or grandparents massacred by these communists are the ones who turn on TV and see those symbols of terror and oppression hanging proudly in Sochi while all the world watches and thinks it's ok.

One of their problems was whether slavery would expand to the new States that were being formed. The South wanted the new States to decide for themselves and the North wanted the federal government to make slavery illegal in the newly formed States. When Lincoln got elected with no Southern votes they had enough and left which everyone thought was okay since when our country was formed it was thought each State could leave whenever they wanted. 

I simply wanted to point out that our Civil War was not black and white.

Piuttosto va aiutato lo studente a trovare lui stesso un senso, non a porgliene uno in modo autoritario (studia perché così prendi i voti).

Il sistema dei voti è come quello del bastone e la carota.

Certamente quei contenuti vanno criticati, ma un tema viene scritto per esporre un'idea. Quell'idea deve essere al centro della questione; per questo non può essercene un voto, poiché è pointless come dici tu.

Hai preso 6. Hai preso 7. Hai preso 8 9 10 2 3 4 5 etc. A cosa serve? Cosa aggiunge ad uno studente? nulla.

Piuttosto va spiegato allo studente dove l'insegnante pensa che abbia sbagliato e i punti deboli nell'esposizione che vanno rafforzati.

Questo può essere fatto tranquillamente senza mettere voti.

Il sistema dei voti è un metodo per facilitare il lavoro agli insegnati, ne più ne meno. E basta.

Technically the North was anti-whatever it took to keep the North together.

Abraham Lincoln knew he needed every non-confederate state to beat the Southern army and claim a ""United"" (really reunited) America. President Lincoln was even noted as saying something like, ""If I could reunite the states without freeing a single slave, I would."" Its not that he was pro-slavery or anything (I believe he personally felt that slaves should be free), he just didn't really care about anything but his duty to keep the country together.

&gt;Also, you think the Southerns that fought against the North were vicious war criminals? 

The southerners were people just like the Northerners. Individuals on both sides did things to prevail that they would objectively never condone in the name of an idea. The Northerners just won.

Few books or researches about them, even less attempts to ""protect"" them. I don't have any sources that really go in depth about the dialects, but from what I see I think it's safe to say the dialects are severely or definitely endangered (using the [language endangerment classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language#Defining_and_measuring_endangerment). Wait for someone from the area to confirm this, but most probably this means only old people speak it, younger people may understand but they don't spontaneously communicate in the dialect; it's also probable that it's more spoken in the more isolated, rural communities, while it fares much worse in more urban areas. 

I have to admit I never cared to learn about how a Northern dialect travelled all the way to Basilicata, but the Italian Wikipedia seems to have some info about that. I'll sum it up briefly for you, but take it with a bit of salt since I haven't checked the sources of that article: It looks like in the XII and/or XIII century some people from Northern Italy settled there, having followed Norman and Anjou feudal lords. Policastro back then belonged to the March of Montferrat. I know it's not much, and it's not very precise, but you can investigate a bit more starting from this information. The article also says that there are similar areas in Sicily (which shows on your map), and it seems as if their origin is similar, settlers from Northern Italy under a Norman feudal lord who ruled the area at the time.

- It is indeed strange that dialects so far removed from the linguistic continuum of the area have survived all these centuries, but that can be explained partly by the fact that only relatively recently Italian has began to spread as everyday language (as opposed to literary use), and partly by the rural and isolated nature of these communities. It's also quite probable that the area affected by the phenomenon was once much bigger, but it reduced in time, especially in the 20th century, and now only a few remnants are still (barely) alive.

- I found [this handy little map](http://www.aptbasilicata.it/a_galloitalico/home.html), knowing the names of the municipalities can help in a research.

- I gave a listen to [this poem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39EQ_zwJoe0&amp;NR=1) in the Sicilian gallo italic dialect, just to get an idea. There is an obvious influence from the Southern dialects (campasti, some /d/s where they shouldn't be), but it's also *very* clear that it's based on a northern dialect (especially because of the ""vocali turbate"", nasal vowels). The two gallo italic dialects probably differ, but I believe what I said might hold true.

- There's also [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixK5nzaynY4) from what I guess is a local television, talking about the dialects (pushing a book about them). Haven't had the time to watch it though!

- Besides ""gallo italici"" some also call these dialects "" dialetti altoitaliani della Basilicata"", so you could maybe try with those keywords.

- Treccani Encyclopedia has [a nice article](http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/comunita-gallo-italica_%28Enciclopedia_dell%27Italiano%29/) that digs a bit deeper.

Byzantium had a very big influence on the early Holy Roman Empire, because of [Theophanu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanu).

After [Otto the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) became emperor and King of Italy he sought an alliance with Byzantium to strengthen his position in Europe. His son, the future [Otto II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) was married to a relative of the Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes.

After Otto I died his son Otto II took over as Emperor, but his reign was very unstable. [Henry II of Bavaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_Bavaria) claimed regency of the Empire and abducted the son of Otto II and Theophanu, Otto III.

Otto II died suddenly in 983 at only 28 years old, and it was Theophanu who secured that her son Otto III would become the new Emperor and the Ottonian dynasty stayed in charge. She became Regent for her son as Empress dowager. She was without doubt the most powerful woman in Europe at that time.

It is certainly to a large part her achievement that the Empire remained relatively sable in this turbulent time. She is a very interesting character. Here is a [very good German documentary about her](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KViEmvoEYqE).

She is also credited to introduce the fork in Western Europe (see the wikipedia article about her for reference). 

Her influence can be seen in [St. Pantaleon's Church in Cologne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._Pantaleon). It is the oldest church of the cult of Saint Pantaleon west of Byzantium. She ordered the construction of the current facade of the church and it is also where she was buried at her own request.

---------------------------------------------------------

&gt;If we compare the economic recovery of the United States since the Great Recession with that of Europe – or more specifically the eurozone countries – the differences are striking, and instructive. The US recession technically lasted about a year and a half – from December 2007 to June 2009. (Of course, for America's 20.3 million unemployed and underemployed, and millions of others, the recession never ended – but more on that below.) The eurozone had a recession of similar length from around January 2008 to April 2009. But it then fell into a longer recession in the third quarter of 2011 that lasted for another two years, and may only be exiting that recession currently.

&gt;This makes a big difference in people's lives. In the eurozone, unemployment is at near record levels of 12.1%; while in the US, it is currently 6.7%. Despite the incompleteness of these measures, these numbers are comparable.

This led to bigger protests, the death of several demonstrators, concerted pressure (rather more effectively from America than from the EU) and a semi-revolt by oligarchs. Taken aback, Mr Yanukovych sacked his prime minister, offered a conditional amnesty and is now seeking a deal with his foes.

Generally speaking though you can perfectly use an American passport as an ID in France to do whatever you want that requires an ID. Very few things that concern tourists do require French citizenship or residency. I actually can't cite any from the top of my head. I think French citizenship is required to vote and to get a Carte Vitale, and residency is mostly required for administrative business such as applying for schools/universities, stuff like that.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"I found out how it was dated.  Long story short, the sediment layer that it is in had already been dated by artifacts, pollen, animal remains, etc. Details:

""The pre-glacial Pleistocene succession at Happisburgh was first investigated by Reid [31] and more recently by West [23]. West described the sediments exposed at the base of the cliffs and in the foreshore at a number of locations and also in a borehole near the former slipway on to the beach (Figure 2b and c). This borehole (HC) demonstrated a succession of laminated silts beneath the Happisburgh Till. Palynological data from the laminated silts indicated an interglacial vegetational succession spanning pollen zones I–IV, which West correlated with the Early Pleistocene Pastonian Stage. These sediments form a mappable unit and have been assigned to the HHF [28]. At HSB3 they consist of a series of predominantly estuarine sands and silts which infill channels, the lower bounding surfaces of which are associated with lag gravel deposits up to 0.2 m in thickness. An artefact assemblage has been recovered from these lag gravels, consisting of flint flakes, flake tools and cores. The sediments also contain a rich assemblage of fauna and flora which suggest that the archaeological evidence can be attributed to the later part of an interglacial. This interglacial is dated on the basis of biostratigraphical and palaeomagnetic evidence to the latter part of the Early Pleistocene, perhaps MIS 21 or MIS 25 [28]. The similarities in the sedimentology and palynology of the sediments at HSB3 with the laminated silts in borehole HC suggest that they are part of the same complex of channel fills; in addition, the laminated sediments can be traced laterally between the two locations though the exact stratigraphic relationship between the channel infills remains uncertain (Figure 2c).

Over the last two years, continued erosion of the cliffs, combined with particularly severe scouring and removal of the modern beach deposits during winter storms, has revealed new exposures of the HHF. The exposures are located between HSB3 and HC (Figure 2b and c) and when beach scour was extensive, horizontal surfaces of laminated silts could be traced laterally from the vicinity of HC north westwards for 150 m towards HSB3. Therefore continuity of these sediments with the laminated silts in borehole HC can be demonstrated.""

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I’ll start with famous political quotes from France, which any Frenchman should have heard of :

&gt;  “Je vous ai compris!” – Translation : “**I understood you!**”. 

From a 1958 speech when Charles de Gaulle obtains full powers because of the Algerian War. Very ambiguous phrase, and most from every side thought he was talking about them.

&gt;  “[Vive le Québec libre!]( http://youtu.be/0l1EYNoHY1A?t=5m54s)” – Translation : “**long live free Quebec**” 

President Charles de Gaulle during his 1967 visit to Canada, to a crowd of Québecois. Naturally, this became a diplomatic scandal between France and Canada.

&gt;  “[Vous n’avez pas le monopole du coeur!]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Munf-V8Wqv8)” – Translation : “**you don’t have a monopoly on heart/love**”. 

Presidential candidate Valéry Giscard d’Estaing towards presidential candidate François Mittérand during the presidential debate of 1974. Mittérand, socialist, insinuated that the capitalist ways of d’Estaing, center-right, were heartless. D’Estaing answered this quote. He won the election, and some say he won thanks to this response.

&gt;  “[Au revoir.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0AjgQtPHfk) ” - Translation : “**goodbye**”. 

President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing’s last televised word as president, in 1981. He lost his reelection against the previously mentioned Mittérand. It’s famous because it’s somewhat humorous and awkward, as you can see in the video. 

&gt;  “[le bruit et l’odeur](http://youtu.be/e4pun9Cdp6Q?t=38s)” – Translation : “**the noise and smell**”. 

Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac during a speech in 1991, criticizes the immigration policy, describes the plight of the French people when they see large families of immigrants getting a lot of money from welfare, and it’s even more bothering if we add “the noise and smell” from said immigrants. Naturally caused a scandal.  

&gt;  “[Vous en avez assez de cette bande de racailles? On va vous en débarrasser]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs2TiewZWXI)” – Translation : “**you’ve had enough of these  hoodlum gangs ? We’ll get rid of them**”.
 
Candidate Sarkozy in 2005, speaking to a resident who told him she’s had enough with the youth gangs. This provoked a scandal, and was considered racist, because of the term “racailles” which isn’t classy. The term is equivalent to the English ""chavs"", though it's mostly associated to black or Arab youths. But in truth, he repeated the resident’s phrase, who was some Muslim-Arab herself. A similar quote/scandal from him, in 2005, is that he said he’ll “**clean the neighborhood with a Kärcher**”, refering to some ghetto/bad neighborhood. Can’t find a video for that.

&gt;  “[Casses-toi, pauvre con!]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdpnkmzYCVc)” – Translation, basically “**bugger off, asshole**”. 

Again, an unclassy one from Sarkozy. President Sarkozy was visiting the 2008 agriculture exhibit in Paris. He was shaking hands and one random person said “don’t touch me, you’ll make me dirty”. And Sarkozy answered this. It made the front news.

true,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,"Having ones cake, and expecting to eat it too:

Germany benefits from the single currency by having its natural foriegn exchange rate suppressed by the wider currency region. Its goods are cheaper, but by the same token it raises the exchange rate for the wider currency region. Making their goods more expensive.

And do so whilst engaging in none of the normal solidarity acts that nation states engage in to normalise wealth potential within regions:

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent! In the UK this ‘sloshing’ occurs in the form of:

a) National pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc)

b) National social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow)

c) Targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds)

d) Additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge)

e) Operating national services hubs from depressed regions to boost wages (DVLA in swansea, etc)

Unless Germany recognises the ‘familial’ relationship, and the obligation that goes along with that, then it needs to leave for the good of its neighbours.

This principal applies equally to the netherlands and finland, but since it is Germany that is the driving economic power for the euro’s sake the answer must be ‘right’.

One mechanism to equalise this foriegn exchange disparity would be eurobonds. To compensate for a higher than natural foriegn exchange rate the wider currency union would borrow collectively, and thus lower their borrowing costs on the back of Germany’s strength.

The quid-pro-quo would be that Germany’s cost of borrowing would rise, as it too would be borrowing through the wider currency union and would see its strength diluted in consequence.

In terms of leaving one Union to join another, one relies on the ceding of massively more sovereignty than the other. In the current union, all sovereignty is ceded. The Scottish government can only legislate on those matters Westminster allows it to, almost all tax is paid to Westminster and then redistributed, (pocket money) and there're major policy zones which are reserved: military matters, welfare, foreign policy, etc. etc. (the list is enumerated on Wikipedia if you want to look in to this further.) 

A sterling zone would probably involve a few financial constraints, Maastricht criteria-esque in nature, and a few other regulations, such as on financial services. It's more like Belgium and Luxembourg in their previous currency union (successful for over 60 years) than, say, a state of the USA. 

What I don't understand is why the press is trying to paint the two unions as equivalent; they're manifestly different. Well, actually, I do understand. They want to be able to say 'what's the point?' That argument only makes sense if you can convince people the unions are equivalent.

During the election campaign he had vehemently refused talk of forming a government with the support of the Socialist People's Party, whose leader he regarded as a communist. However, after the election it became clear that he could only form a government with their support, and so he changed his previous conviction and formed a government with the support of the Socialist People's Party. This government became known as 'The Red Cabinet'.

&gt; **If those are the facts, then I refuse to awknowledge the facts!** (Hvis det er fakta, så benægter jeg fakta!)

This very famous quote, which is now often used to ridicule political opponents, was first said by PM Søren Kjær in a debate in the late 1800s. The fact that Søren Kjær was from Jutland and spoke heavily Jutish, a dialect often considered redneckish and making people appear dumber (Sorry Jutlanders, don't kill me), emphasizes the ignorance of the statement.

&gt; **Nothing has been swept under the rug** (Der er ikke fejet noget ind under gulvtæppet)

The Conservative PM [Poul Schlüter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Schl%C3%BCter) said this in 1989 regarding a scandal, known as the Tamil-case, in which the justice ministry had knowingly broken the law in order to refuse family reunion to a group of Tamil refugees. Of course a lot had actually been swept under the rug, and the aftermath of the scandal led to Schlüter's resignation and a new government led by the Social Democrat Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Fun fact, from Poul Nyrup Rasmussen we have had [three PMs named Rasmussen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Denmark#List_of_Ministers_of_State_.281918_.E2.80.93_present.29) in a row).

&gt; **Early retirement benefits won't be touched!** (Der bliver ikke rørt ved efterlønnen!)

This was a campaign promise by Social Democratic PM [Poul Nyrup Rasmussen](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Nyrup_Rasmussen) in the 1998 elections, where the government was reelected in a very close election where one of the pivotal reasons for the reelection was the promise not to reduce early retirement benefits. Of course this then happened almost immediately after the election, which is why this quote lives on in infamy as a symbol of the fickleness of politicians. 

&gt; **You will never be house trained** (Stuerene det bliver I aldrig)

Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said this in 1999 about [the Danish People's Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People's_Party), meaning that they will never be an acceptable party from a moral view point because of their views on immigrants. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen later lost the election in 2001 and the right wing Venstre leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Now General Secretary of NATO) became PM with the support of the Danish People's Party. The issue of immigration is generally agreed to be the main reason that the Social Democrats lost power, because a very large portion of Danish society were sceptic of immigration, including voters on the left wing. After the 2001 elections Denmark then adopted stricter immigration laws, which much of Europe later followed, and which the Social Democrats in Denmark have also later agreed to, realising that a lot of their own voters would otherwise leave them for the Danish People's Party.",0,1391859795,null,0,1391870418,0,cfa4g22,t3_1xcj5q,t1_cfa4g22,t3_1xcj5q,null,1432307246,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Let me start by saying that communism and nazism are radically different things by definition. Nazism is a fascist idealogy which incorporates racism and antisemitism. Communism advocated a classless system where everything belongs to the community where there is no privately own property. If you are a nazi, you are a bad guy by definition. If you are a communist, you are not. 

Then there is the connotation that both symbols carry. The swastika is only a symbol of negativity everywhere(apart from a few asian buddist groups). There is only a connotation with the atrocities in the second world war. It is a bit more complicated with the hammer and sickle. In a few eastern european countries it has the same connotation, but in a lot of other it is very different. In russia it's also a symbol of them being a world power, of being space explorers etc. I understand that you might think it's bullshit, but the symbol is a big part of their history.

Lastly I think it is important to note that they were showing their history starting from the northern war. It would be odd to not include a symbol that represents 80 years of their history.

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"Ireland remained neutral in WWII, much to the annoyance of Winston Churchill.  After the war was over, a spat developed between Churchill and Irish leader Eamon de Valera, with Churchill strongly condemning Ireland for its policy of neutrality and de Valera responding to defend Ireland and criticize Churchill's condemnation.

A key extract from Churchill's speech:

&gt; However, with a restraint and poise to which, I say, history will find few parallels, we never laid a violent hand upon them, which at times would have been quite easy and quite natural, and left the de Valera Government to frolic with the German and later with the Japanese representatives to their heart’s content…

And extracts from de Valera's response:

&gt; I know the reply I would have given a quarter of a century ago. But I have deliberately decided that that is not the reply I shall make tonight. I shall strive not to be guilty of adding any fuel to the flames of hatred and passion which, if continued to be fed, promise to burn up whatever is left by the war of decent human feeling in Europe.

&gt; ...

&gt; Mr. Churchill makes it clear that, in certain circumstances, he would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his action by Britain’s necessity. It seems strange to me that Mr. Churchill does not see that this, if accepted, would mean Britain’s necessity would become a moral code and that when this necessity became sufficiently great, other people’s rights were not to count.

&gt; ...

&gt; Surely Mr. Churchill must see that if his contention be admitted in our regard, a like justification can be framed for similar acts of aggression elsewhere and no small nation adjoining a great Power could ever hope to be permitted to go its own way in peace...

De Valera's full speech can be heard [here](http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/681-history-of-rte/684-rte-1940s/289798-eamon-de-valeras-response-to-winston-churchill/).",0,1391862383,null,0,false,0,cfa4t7b,t3_1xcj5q,t1_cfa4t7b,t3_1xcj5q,null,1432307417,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Country bumpkins.  Farmers.  Hot Fuzz 'Yarp' and the unintelligible guy with the gun cache.  Killer scrumpy (zombifyingly strong cider [fermented apples] - hippsters know it for Perry or a pear variant of cider).  In fact it tends to trend all down through Devon and Cornwall (the rest of the leg down to the foot).  Westward Ho is based here so there must be some pirates hereabouts.  Undercurrent murmurings of independence, which the rest don't take seriously because we know they don't know how to build their own tractors.  Surfer dudes/dudettes take their VW camper wagons here to die.

We have no idea where these people came from.  None whatsoever.     

They don't seem to be Scottish or English related.  Preliminary attempts at communication have begun.  Whilst beautiful enough their women folk seem to have some form of natural anti-freeze property to their blood which activates when fused with alcohol and skimpy clothing.  Impervious to frost damage after 8pm.

Land of the silliest accent.  Seriously, The Times did a poll on which accents made people sound more intelligent.  [The Brum accent came last with 'silence' being judged more intelligent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brummie#Stereotypes).   Something distinctly lovable about them though.  There's an ongoing argument whether they belong to the North or the South of England; the North argues that they must be Southern, whilst Southerners maintain they're clearly from the North.

&gt;**The Winds of Change are blowing through this continent** - Prime Minister Harold Macmilland 1960.

The PM gave a speech in South Africa and used these words. It is considered to be a key speech in accelerating the decolonisation of Africa. It was especially poignant after Britain's humiliating and disastrous involvement in the Suez.

&gt;**Rivers of Blood** - Enoch Powell MP, 1968.

Not a quote, but the name of a speech given by Member of Parliament Enoch Powell. The name of the speech comes from the line ""As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see 'the River Tiber foaming with much blood.'"" It is a quote from Virgil.

Powell was discussing the affect that he believed immigration would have upon Britain.  It is still discussed to this day.

Thatcher used these phrase when she refused to perform a U-turn on her liberalisation policies.

&gt; **Defeat? I do not know the meaning of the word** - Thatcher 1982

This was her response when she was told that Britain entering into military conflict in the Falklands could lead to defeat.

And now some light humour:

&gt; ** Every Prime Minister needs a Willie** Thatcher 1980s

Thatcher was referring to her Deputy Prime Minister William Whitelaw, on whom she depended greatly. Apparently the irony was lost on her.

What I (and many others) contend though is that you can't just look at a city's history to determine its fate. Here's an example: Istanbul (Constantinople) was a Greek city for a thousand years before it was conquered by the Turks. Now it's a Turkish city. There are certainly nationalistic groups in Greece who wish to reconquer the city and unite it with Greece, but they are a fringe minority. Everybody else thinks the city is and should remain Turkish. They don't appeal to history, but rather to the fact that the people *currently living in the city* are Turkish.

In the Gdansk example, my opinion is therefore that irrespective of the city's history, it *legitimately* should have belonged to Germany in 1923 and thereafter *because the people living there at that time were German*. They were wrongly displaced after the war. Now, the people in the city are Polish and therefore it legitimately belongs to Poland now.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"There are a number of key arguments in Piketty’s book. One is that the six-decade period of growing equality in western nations – starting roughly with the onset of World War I and extending into the early 1970s – was unique and highly unlikely to be repeated. That period, Piketty suggests, represented an exception to the more deeply rooted pattern of growing inequality.

According to Piketty, those halcyon six decades were the result of two world wars and the Great Depression. The owners of capital – those at the top of the pyramid of wealth and income – absorbed a series of devastating blows. These included the loss of credibility and authority as markets crashed; physical destruction of capital throughout Europe in both World War I and World War II; the raising of tax rates, especially on high incomes, to finance the wars; high rates of inflation that eroded the assets of creditors; the nationalization of major industries in both England and France; and the appropriation of industries and property in post-colonial countries.

At the same time, the Great Depression produced the New Deal coalition in the United States, which empowered an insurgent labor movement. The postwar period saw huge gains in growth and productivity, the benefits of which were shared with workers who had strong backing from the trade union movement and from the dominant Democratic Party. Widespread support for liberal social and economic policy was so strong that even a Republican president who won easily twice, Dwight D. Eisenhower, recognized that an assault on the New Deal would be futile. In Eisenhower’s words, “Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear from that party again in our political history.”

The six decades between 1914 and 1973 stand out from the past and future, according to Piketty, because the rate of economic growth exceeded the after-tax rate of return on capital. Since then, the rate of growth of the economy has declined, while the return on capital is rising to its pre-World War I levels.

“If the rate of return on capital remains permanently above the rate of growth of the economy – this is Piketty’s key inequality relationship,” Milanovic writes in his review, it “generates a changing functional distribution of income in favor of capital and, if capital incomes are more concentrated than incomes from labor (a rather uncontroversial fact), personal income distribution will also get more unequal — which indeed is what we have witnessed in the past 30 years.”",1,1391862974,null,0,false,0,cfa4wev,t3_1xcmce,t1_cfa4wev,t1_cfa4nrv,null,1432307462,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The idea of Europe, European culture, European identity, those are things that don't simply vanish due to minor economic difficulties. There is no question about survival of the European community, however what will happen is transformation of the community including working ways and hows of individual and shared responsibilities.

For example currently we have a kind of a conflict between sourthern European idea of societal solidarity vs. Northen European system based collective responsibility. My wording may not be exact, but you get the idea. It is interesting to see what kind of system the EU will have when we have these two different takes on how to deal with problems.

And again in case of internal devaluation with circa 50% youth employment, the thing is that even without Euro, sourthern European countries would face lowering of standards of living in their socities if they don't make huge societal reforms.

In Italia è in corso, ora, mentre tu leggi questo articolo, un colpo di Stato, non puoi più far finta di nulla. Non è il primo, potrebbe essere l'ultimo. In questi anni ci sono stati molti colpetti di Stato dall'adozione del Porcellum che ha creato un Parlamento di nominati dai partiti, all'uso indiscriminato dei decreti-legge che ha spossessato il Parlamento della funzione legislativa con il beneplacito del Presidente della Repubblica. La scorsa estate c'è stato un tentativo di colpetto di Stato per scardinare la Costituzione modificando l'articolo 138, ma è stato sventato dal M5S. La volontà popolare viene rappresentata dagli eletti in Parlamento e l'Italia, secondo la Costituzione, è una Repubblica parlamentare. Così dovrebbe essere, ma non è così. Il passo successivo è l'eliminazione dell'opposizione. Finora non era necessario. I partiti per più di vent'anni hanno esercitato un consociativismo spinto, larghe intese sottobanco. Non c'era bisogno di far tacere l'opposizione perché non c'era opposizione. Quindi, quindi... Si riabilita il socio Berlusconi, uscito dal Senato per esclusivo merito del M5S. Si fa una legge elettorale extraparlamentare, il Pregiudicatellum, con un pregiudicato e un condannato in primo grado, Renzie, assistiti da Verdini che ha più processi che anni, per impedire in qualunque caso la vittoria del M5S . In Aula, però, il M5S ha ancora diritto di parola e può far decadere dei decreti legge porcata come IMU/Bankitalia che ha regalato 7,5 miliardi alle banche. Va tolto perciò, per finire il lavoro, anche il diritto di parola all'opposizione. Ed è avvenuto con una decisione che non rientra nelle facoltà della presidente Boldrini, che non è presente nelle procedure della Camera, come una volta si faceva per i decreti regi lo scorso giovedì 29 gennaio 2014. E' un fatto gravissimo, avvenuto per la prima volta nella storia della Repubblica. D'ora in poi, qualunque discussione parlamentare può essere annullata, qualunque decreto-legge può essere approvato senza modifiche. E' la fine della democrazia. Il decreto legge IMU-Bankitalia va invalidato per almeno due motivi. Conteneva decreti tra loro totalmente disomogenei ed è stato approvato CONTRO le leggi del Parlamento. Laura Boldrini deve dimettersi, ha violato, lei che doveva farle rispettare per ruolo, le leggi della democrazia. Nessuno prima di lei si è spinto fino a questo punto. Il M5S farà in modo di invalidare il decreto e di ottenere le dimissioni della Boldrini.

Die Anschläge der 90er Jahre haben sich sicher nicht nur den ""Migranten"" in die Erinnerung gebrannt und dazu gehört neben Nachbarn die sich plötzlich dem Mob anschließen eben leider auch viel zu oft eine Polizei und vorallem die Politik die zu schnell einen rassistischen Hintergrund ausgeschlossen hat.

Im Toppost schreibt jemand es sei ""gefährlich"" ""direkt von Fremdenhass"" auszugehen. Für mich scheint der Schaden aber größer zu sein wenn man diese Möglichkeit und die Ängste der Betroffenen (Wenn mein Haus angezündet wird habe ich die gleichen Probleme wie jeder anderer, muss mich aber wenigstens nicht fürchten dass Rassisten mich umbringen wollen weil ich ihnen nicht deutsch genug bin) ignoriert als wenn man früh auf einen möglichen rassistischen Hintergrund hinweist auch wenn es am Ende anders kommt.",0,1391866103,null,0,false,0,cfa5hh2,t3_1x9g0v,t1_cfa5hh2,t1_cfa4w85,null,1432307735,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

&gt; Why are males in Germany seen as troublemakers? Here the stereotypes like that are broken down more by race, unfortunately.

Thing is, Germany runs a little different concering ""race"". Around here we didn't have a visually foreign population for a long time. It starts to change slowly but nevertheless you can live in a small town your entire life without even seeing PoC. 

We have ""the turks"" (descendants of migrate workers from turkey in the 70s) who are, despite a lot of right-wingers claiming otherwise, pretty well integrated. Fun thing is, they're integrated in the lower class mainly. Thus influencing slang and stereotypical behaviour of the lower class. They've been targeted by a lot of racism in the past and present but are growingly ready to step up against it. In former east germany there are also a lot of vientnamese-originated people (same story as the turkish migrants: came to work here, were treated as shit but decided to stay anyway; good integrated nowadays)

But there aren't a lot of dark skinned people here. Most of them are or ar descendants of 1) buisnesspeople who live internationally 2) US-Soldiers 3) Refugees
That's not a lot of people though (by far not enough Refugees if you ask me). They will always be seen as foreign by alot of people (""bio-Deutsche""). 

So when you are in Gymnasium (back to topic) there aren't a lot PoC. The ones on my school I could count on my hands. Those had all the fun with the racism. 

But if you have no group to marginalize, groups tend to seek someone to rant upon. And found where: boys. Agressive, tribal, natural, wild. Good in sports, bad at maths. 

The way school works it compliments those who can learn. And as a boy you are thaught that you can not. It's the way stereotypes make you your own stereotype. You act like you are expected to. 


&gt; Is Germany more full of gender stereotypes?

I wouldn't say more full. They are just more focused upon, seeing the lack of PoC to discriminate. 

&gt; I act more feminine at times than masculine, and people have even made assumptions I'm gay in the past because of it (I'm straight as an arrow).

Furthermore it does so by basically keeping monetary interest rates as high as necessary, pushing the capital gains further up. Further still it's not supposed to do anything about low growth, and it's recognized by all economists that high interest rates stiffle growth by making investments costly!

So basically our economic system is nearly as perfectly designed as it could be to generate inequality; the only thing going in the other direction is our social safety net, and look how well it's faring in Greece: it's imploded.

Dies sind alles Situationen gewesen in denen Ashton bei Verhandlungen keine gemeinsame EU Position vertreten konnte,  weil die Mitgliedsländer uneins waren. Nur weil Ashton Verhandlungen führt heißt dies nicht das sie eine starke Verhandlungsposition vertreten kann, wenn die einzelnen EU Mitgliedsländer nicht hinter der Position stehen.

However, I do not deny, that Poland let more in this area than Lithuania (official names and street signs).

Regarding the first link. I cannot and not going to answer to all the topics but I'll just make remarks, to make you doubt the information provided. Btw the article is old and as things are changing, but not everything at a time.

* Education. Lithuania adopted new new law in 2011, which provides exactly the same rights to get education in Polish as Poland for Lithuanian minority. Additionally, Polish in Lithuania have more subjects in Polish and can learn from Polish text books, which is not the case in Poland. The law was still very criticized by Polish politicians in both countries. Maybe you can tell me why?

* Second and third issues we already discussed.

* Regarding elections. Let's look at facts, Polish party (AWPL) is represented in Seimas and actually is in the majority already for a second year, have one minister and a few vice ministers. They are also represented in European parliament. Also, Poles (AWPL) dominate local elections in their represented areas for the last 24 years (this is important in next bullet point). In addition, to the mentioned rule of 5%, there is other rule that if several parties collaborate threshold is 7%. AWPL ussually collaborates with other parties, yet the rule never was applied for them. Moreover, you can get elected as a person in Seimas, thus the rule may be at all irrelevant. 
Districts are often changed in all Lithuania, because of decreasing population and urbanization (majority of Poles lives in rural areas).

* Land.
&gt; Discrimination against the Polish minority during land restitution in the area of Vilnius, resulting in the dispersal of compact Polish communities

This is funny. Land restitution is a business of local authorities. During all this restitution period Poles were ruling in the area around Vilnius. Additionally, the land is more expensive there, so the risk of corruption is higher. For example, in other areas were land is expensive and minorities does not exist, the situation is comparable. I see here a simple corruption by the same party that makes all these claims. I would say they even tricked themselves in saying that they are incompetent and/or corrupt.",0,1391869729,null,0,false,0,cfa6as2,t3_1x6rpw,t1_cfa6as2,t1_cfa4djs,null,1432308119,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; (...) un colpo di Stato (...) Non è il primo, potrebbe essere l'ultimo

Pronti, via e teoria del doppio Stato a valanga. Il fatto che, dato che è di golpe che si sta parlando, sia naturale tirarla fuori (specie considerando il pubblico cui ci si rivolge) non la rende meno ridicola

&gt; In questi anni ci sono stati molti colpetti di Stato, dall'adozione del Porcellum

Che è stato regolarmente votato dal Parlamento

&gt; all'uso indiscriminato dei decreti-legge che ha spossessato il Parlamento della funzione legislativa con il beneplacito del Presidente della Repubblica

La stragrande maggioranza dei decreti approvati nel lasso di tempo in questione è risultata perfettamente in regola coi requisiti. Quando questo non è successo - e i casi sono parecchi - la magistratura o lo stesso presidente della Repubblica non si sono mai fatti problemi a rimandare tutto indietro

&gt; La scorsa estate c'è stato un tentativo di colpetto di Stato per scardinare la Costituzione modificando l'articolo 138, ma è stato sventato dal M5S

Anche ammettendo per amore di dibattito che la modifica della procedura aggravata sia un colpetto di Stato, la cosa è saltata quando si è sfilata Forza Italia, non quando si sono sfilati i Cinque stelle (che si erano sfilati in partenza risultando ininfluenti e lasciando una maggioranza autosufficiente sulla materia)

&gt; Non c'era bisogno di far tacere l'opposizione perché non c'era opposizione

Numericamente parlando, nella seconda repubblica le opposizioni hanno avuto un consistenza numerica sconosciuta a quelle della prima (ad eccezione forse di prima e settima legislatura che il Pci era forte)

&gt; Berlusconi, uscito dal Senato per esclusivo merito del M5S

No, per esclusivo merito dei magistrati. La storia che senza il voto palese imposto dai Cinque stelle Berlusconi si sarebbe salvato non ha senso - oltre perché presenta l'inconveniente di essere indimostrabile - perché al massimo ci sarebbe stato da aspettare la determinazione della pena accessoria e poi sarebbe decaduto in automatico

&gt; Si fa una legge elettorale extraparlamentare

La riforma della legge elettorale si trova regolarmente in commissione Affari costituzionali alla Camera

&gt; decreti legge porcata come IMU/Bankitalia che ha regalato 7,5 miliardi alle banche

Se ne parlava [qui](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/1xao8r/il_decreto_bankitalia_non_%C3%A8_un_furto_agli_italiani/) ieri

&gt; Ed è avvenuto con una decisione che non rientra nelle facoltà della presidente Boldrini

La tagliola è di esclusiva e assoluta competenza del presidente (al punto che se presiede un vice non la può usare)

&gt; che non è presente nelle procedure della Camera

Come svariate altre cose che sono presenti solo nel regolamento di una Camera e che, per prassi, da sempre si applicano ad entrambe

&gt; D'ora in poi, qualunque discussione parlamentare può essere annullata, qualunque decreto-legge può essere approvato senza modifiche

Questo anche d'ora in prima

&gt; Il decreto legge IMU-Bankitalia (...) Conteneva decreti tra loro totalmente disomogenei 

L'accorpamento di decreti è cosa lecita e accettata, tant'è che sul pacchetto Imu-Bankitalia è stata votata la fiducia senza problemi

2. WohnraumzunurvorübergehendemGebrauch(§549Abs.2Ziff.1BGB)
Sofern der Zweck der Wohnraumüberlassung von kurzer Dauer ist, kommt dieser Ausschlusstatbestand in Betracht. Dies hängt nicht nur von den getroffenen mietvertraglichen Vereinbarungen sondern entscheidend davon ab, ob nur ein vorübergehender Wohnbedarf oder ein allgemeiner Wohnbedarf befriedigt werden soll. Entscheidend ist dabei, ob der Mieter an der Mietwohnung seinen Lebensmittelpunkt begründen wollte. Ist dies der Fall, scheidet ein vorübergehender Gebrauch aus. Indiz dafür ist insbesondere die Dauer des Mietverhältnisses1. Beispiel für diese Gruppe ist eine Vermietung für die Dauer einer Ausstellung, Baufertigstellung bis zur Fertigstellung eines Neubaus, Ferienaufenthalt, Ablegung eines Examens, Hotelzimmer, Gastprofessur, Sportveranstaltung oder Tagung.
Nicht hierzu gehören Vermietungen an einen Gastarbeiter, Studenten für mehr als ein Semester, Wohngemeinschaft, Vermietung bis zum Verkauf zu einem ungewissen Zeitpunkt. Indiz für das Fehlen eines vorübergehenden Gebrauchs ist meist eine Vermietung für ein Jahr oder länger.
Eine formale Vereinbarung im Mietvertrag, dass die Überlassung zum vorübergehenden Gebrauch erfolgt, scheitert an § 573b Abs. 4 BGB, da dies eine zum Nachteil des Mieters unzulässige Vereinbarung wäre und eine Umgehung der Voraussetzung des § 549 Abs. 2 Ziff. 1 BGB.",0,1391873638,null,0,false,0,cfa7eg3,t3_1x9yzl,t1_cfa7eg3,t1_cfa6z0j,null,1432308639,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

From a medical point of view, there is usually nothing wrong in not prescribing medicine for the common cold. Worse, prescribing antibiotics for it is *wrong* and frowned upon usually - there are even campaigns advising against it.

See, the common cold is a genuinely benign, auto-limited viral infection that may cause symptoms but doesn't have any specific treatment. Unless you have enough symptoms to think it's actually bacterial, antibiotics are not the answer and wouldn't make you feel better in any way (maybe because of the Placebo effect). Worse, it selects resistant bacteria, a huge world health problem issue that is only getting worse. 

For Sore throats, they are usually mild infections that your body will solve given time, so the majority of them will be cured without the need for antibiotics again. 

Doctors could indeed prescribe NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for symptom relief, but drugs are never risk-free and it's up to the doctor and the patient to decide if it's worth taking them. German doctors may be taught that they are not really necessary (as they don't alter the duration or natural course of the disease), or it may be a cultural aspect. In any case, resting at home, using scarves and drinking tea is not wrong at all.

This isn't just an opinion, this is a principle that is integrated in the treaties that define the relationship between Switzerland and the EU. If Switzerland stops the principle of free movement or otherwise opts out of Schengen, *all* of the treaties are revoked due to the Guillotine Clause.

Ask them how european they feel!

Actually it is not sunny in Finland, we are right now under a major transformation period where we need to make difficult decisions to fix our competitiveness and make society work with much smaller generations entering the workforce. Do note that our competitiveness problem has nothing to do with Euro or our wages, it has everything to do with having firms offering products nobody wants and our economy being unable to renew itself fast enough. All major internal policy decisions.

In case of southern European youths not getting jobs, even if they had their own currency that they could devalue the hell out of it, there still wouldn't be anymore jobs. The Spanish export industries are already in full swing, they can't hire anymore. Of course with their own currency the Spanish govermeant could print money like mad and provide people with ""jobs"", but then what, they would as poor as they are now.

The key to solve economic problems in the south has everything to do with allowing markets to function and zero to do govermeant subsidies or easy fiscal policies.

Yeah, Iceland is doing great with foreign exchange regulations. Not.

We already have enough solidarity, where do you think monies came to build motorway networks and other infrastructure to south? Where do you think bailout monies came? The thing is, we have enough solidarity, what we need is taking responsibility.

Nope. ECB policy aims to keep inflation expectations low, which keeps term premia of bonds low, which keep interest rates low. An inflationary push only erodes those fixed income assets that are already invested with a long duration, but it permanently increases interest rates subsequently.

&gt; Furthermore it does so by basically keeping monetary interest rates as high as necessary

Interest rates are as low as the ECB can humanly push them, nearly zero in fact. They try hard to get it even lower.

&gt; it's not supposed to do anything about low growth

That's exactly what lowering the interest rates to zero is supposed to achieve. (Though the mandate gives priority to inflation control, inflation is not a problem currently. Thus the ECB can push interest rates to the lowest point ever.)

true,h33i0,UKGB,London...,"The economic case is strong. In 1989, the richest 20% of the worlds population (West + Japan) controlled 80% of its income. This is rapidly declining.

So of course NATO is losing power. The western nations no longer have such a dominance on the world economy, their share of it will continue to shrink as other nations develop more. This coincides with developing nations upgrading their military capabilities making NATO's dominance  less and less. A recent study by the [Carnegie endowment](http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/05/03/china-s-military-and-u.s.-japan-alliance-in-2030-strategic-net-assessment/g1wh) showed that in 15 years, 2030, the combined US and Japan alliance may not be enough to overcome China *near* Japan.  

&gt;  Significant absolute and possibly relative shifts in the military balance between China and the alliance in Japan’s vicinity are likely.
&gt; 
&gt;  In the most probable future scenarios facing these three actors, the U.S.-Japan alliance will either only narrowly retain military superiority in the airspace and waters near Japan or the balance will become uncertain at best.

By then the Chinese economy is projected to have overtaken the US in PPP and nominal terms. This is the same situation that is happening but on a smaller scale worldwide. In every sphere, countries are modernising and are becoming more important and relying less on the West. We are a small part of the world population yet have most of its resources and wealth, that triangular nature is slowly eroding away as we come to the end of the era of western dominance. 

I think we should look to strengthen international norms like the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and make developing nations more important stakeholders in international society. When nations are not stakeholders in international norms, institutions and law, they will be less hesitant to destroy them. Which is why China's ascension to the world bank was important, which is why the next round of elections for the head of the IMF and World Bank is important. Those positions are reserved only for a European and an American. It needs to be shown to be appointed based on **merit**. If its not, the emerging developing nations will not respect the institutions. We saw this before with Japan and the League of Nations, [I hope we do not repeat it again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Equality_Proposal). 

If history has taught us anything it is that Nations rise and they fall, the west may not be at the top of the pile in a century's time, but the institutions that have been built since the world war can still be maintained if we work and engage to make other nations a part of it. The UN is constantly undermined by America  (and the UK and France occasionally) and this needs to change, otherwise when we need to rely on it, it will be undermined by others following our example.

I was a bright kid with a very high motivation so I went to the Gymnasium without any problems. Can't remember that much about Grundschule (elementary school), but that we were very few going to Gymnasium, 3 out of 25 IIRC.

My Gymnasium is a great school! There were really few teachers I disliked, the majority of our teaching staff cares for their students and build a real relationship with them. There are teachers who are often invited to Birthday Parties. Our school was very active. We had musicals and theater shows, we raise money for an african school every year. We got a snack shop run by students, it competes with the offical cafeteria ;)

I have a very positive opinion of my school, but you have to see that I'm living in a quite wealthy, rural area. I'd guess at least 70% of the students in our Gymnasium have a academic background. People around here don't seriously fight. We have no drug and violence problem often seen in inner city schools. Every year we see former students come back as teachers.

My very own experience is as you see great, but the system is horrible. As a workers kid you usually don't make an Abitur. If the working class manages to make Abitur the state institutes try to change the minds of the students.

Obviously false. Communists were highly aware of ethnic groups and did their best to homogenize their countries, especially after the war.

If you want to operate a business in a country surely you have to abide by their laws? But what the US does is basically twist the arms either via military or economic force into countries not doing so. That's where they get their growth.

&gt;Thing is, Germany runs a little different concering ""race"". Around here we didn't have a visually foreign population for a long time. It starts to change slowly but nevertheless you can live in a small town your entire life without even seeing PoC. 

Right, in Europe you can go much of your life with little interaction with non-""white"" people, correct?

And yeah, doesn't Germany have a problem with racism and neo-nazis and such?  By the way, despite being as white as a q-tip, I was raised more or less exclusively around hispanics and asians, so I feel I'm less susceptible to the racial stereotypes that pervade American culture, which has a lot of problems in that area.

That one would be relevant to our subject. Those gypsy clans made the news mostly because of the problems they had the german authorities that ultimately resulted in raids by the interpol and romanian police forces on their homes in Timisoara. They were being charged with money laundering, tax evasion, defrauding. But they're also linked with human trafficking (mostly beggars and sex workers). Most of their illegal activities are happening abroad, but they also make a lot of money from real-estate. They falsify documents, testaments, and also use the bureaucracy and corruption in the romanian government to reinstate lands of buildings confiscated by the communist regime.

&gt;*""They cut my ear, I couldn't feel how much they cut off my ear.

&gt;Bulatov said his captors were continually asking who was funding the protests in Ukraine and accused him of being a US spy paid by the CIA.

In my personal opinion aega100's frist point is a wide exaggeration. Switzerland has not a density near Hongkong or any other major city for that matter. The problem is much more that it is like one major city spread out across the whole length of the country and all of it is connected by a well-functioning public transport system, which led people to build a house in the countryside and work in the city. Or the newest fad: Live in one city and work in another. Add to that the impressive influx of population from outside and you have a system constantly at its brink.

His second point which aggrevates that feeling of ""Dichtestress"" (you gotta love the german language: density stress) many Swiss experience is the historically rooted self-concept of a (peasant) village society, antipathetic towards urbanity and with it, towards tall buildings. The ""Einfamilienhaus"" (one family home) has long been the epitome of the ideal home. All this is changing though at the moment, maybe also thanks to the German immigration, which brings in a lot of young and urban cosmopolites, the very antithesis to the general Swiss self-concept.

true,wordboyhere,null,null,"&gt;According to Piketty, those halcyon six decades were the result of two world wars and the Great Depression. The owners of capital – those at the top of the pyramid of wealth and income – absorbed a series of devastating blows. These included the loss of credibility and authority as markets crashed; physical destruction of capital throughout Europe in both World War I and World War II; the raising of tax rates, especially on high incomes, to finance the wars; high rates of inflation that eroded the assets of creditors; the nationalization of major industries in both England and France; and the appropriation of industries and property in post-colonial countries.

I really hope he talked about how those were ***top marginal*** tax rates. Why does it matter?

[Not only has revenue as a share of GDP stayed intact, page 78](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/WorkingPaper-9.pdf) [But as of 2010 the share paid by the rich is much higher:](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324705104578151601554982808.html?mod=googlenews_wsj) 

&gt;In 1958, approximately two million filers (4.4% of all taxpayers) earned the $12,000 or more for married couples needed to face marginal rates as high as 30%. **These Americans paid about 35% of all income taxes.** *And now?* In 2010, 3.9 million taxpayers (2.75% of all taxpayers) were subjected to rates that were 33% or higher. These Americans—many of whom would hardly call themselves wealthy—reported an adjusted gross income of $209,000 or higher, and they paid **49.7% of all income taxes.**

&gt;In contrast, **the share of taxes paid by the bottom two-thirds of taxpayers has fallen dramatically over the same period.** In 1958, these Americans accounted for 41.3% of adjusted gross income and paid 29% of all federal taxes. By 2010, their share of adjusted gross income had fallen to 22.5%. But their share of taxes paid fell far more dramatically—to 6.7%. The 77% decline represents the single biggest difference in the way the tax burden is shared in this country since the late 1950s. 

*****

I also keep seeing this big deal made of income inequality. If we take income, to mean total compensation, then no income inequality [*has declined.*](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/WorkingPaper-9.pdf)

&gt;Burkhauser, Larrimore and Simon (2010:34) compare inequality of after-tax income 
at cyclical peaks with only cash (not in-kind) transfers included, and find Gini 
coefficients of .394 in 1989, .390 in 2000 and .396 in 2007— *indicating virtually no 
sustained change in inequality of aftertax money income since 1989.* **After also 
including the insurance value of private and public health insurance (and thereby 
coming closer to disposable income), the Gini measure of inequality falls—from .372 
in 1989 to .364 in 2000 and .362 in 2007.2**

As of 2007 before tax GINI is 0.49 and after tax is 0.38. 

Wage inequality has stagnated. Compensation, *as it is measured* by the BEA has only risen modestly with productivity. When the BEA measures total compensation it uses CPI(U-RS) for wages and benefits, **except for health insurance**, which is deflated with PCE. [This becomes problematic](http://www.nber.org/feldstein/WAGESandPRODUCTIVITY.meetings2008.pdf)

&gt;The second measurement problem is the way in which nominal output and
nominal compensation are converted to real values before making the comparison.
**Although any consistent deflation of the two series of nominal values will show
similar movements of productivity and compensation, it is misleading in this
context to use different deflators for measuring productivity and real
compensation.**

&gt;A quick review of what economic theory says about the relation between
productivity and compensation will clarify the correct choice of price deflator for
making this comparison and will also indicate how productivity and
compensation would be expected to move in a competitive economy. In the
classroom we often abstract from differences in prices by assuming an economy
with a single product and therefore summarize the basic wage determination
condition by saying that a competitive firm pays a wage equal to the marginal
product of labor. But when we recognize the multiproduct nature of the economy,
we say that the competitive firm pays a nominal wage equal to the marginal
revenue product of labor, i.e., to the marginal product of labor multiplied by the
price of the firm’s product. **The key real relation must therefore be between
changes in productivity in the nonfarm business sector and changes in the
compensation paid in that sector deflated by the product price and not by some
consumer price that also reflects goods and services produced outside the domestic
nonfarm business sector.**

He suggests using more consistent measures:

&gt;Between 1970 and 2006, the implicit price deflator for the output of the
nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent while the consumer
price index (the CPI-U series with the research series for the years after 1978) rose
at 4.3 percent. If one uses the CPI data to calculate real compensation, its growth
is reduced to 1.2 percent a year and therefore substantially less than the 1.9 percent
annual rise in productivity. **Since the productivity tables in the Economic Report
of the President and in Economic Indicators use the CPI to define real
compensation, it is not surprising that many analysts have concluded that the
official data do not support the theoretical relation between productivity growth
and compensation. This is, as I have emphasized, a misreading of the data.**

What does productivity and total compensation then look like once graphed? [Like this](http://bp1.blogger.com/_b6CLevEGCD0/SA_VkTrDzqI/AAAAAAAAAb8/YOOFHgwLTUM/s1600/realwages.bmp).

Interesting, an increase 3.0% for the top 1% and a decrease of 3.9% for the bottom *during* the Great Recession. Before? (2004) An increase of 0.6% vs. a decrease of 1.2%. *Nothing to do with people lending and getting costly homes I hope?*

Similar trends. (During the internet boom the bottom's share of income would increase by 0.4%.)

Why the decline? [Partially because both pension accounts and debt, both somewhat partially figured in into the net worth measurement, make up a significant amount of wealth for the bottom 90%](http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wealthydebt1.gif).

[What about other countries?](http://www.wider.unu.edu/stc/repec/pdfs/rp2008/dp2008-03.pdf)

&gt;**Long time series of wealth inequality estimates are available for Denmark, France, 
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the USA and the UK (see Ohlsson et al. 2008).** From the 
early years of the twentieth century up to the mid 1970s wealth inequality declined 
dramatically in all of these countries with the exception of Switzerland. This parallels 
the decline of income inequality observed over the same period. **In contrast, wealth and 
income inequality have behaved somewhat differently during the last three decades 
wealth inequality in developed countries.** Increases in income inequality have been 
strong in the USA and UK, and have been observed in most OECD countries over this 
period. While the wealth share of the top 1 per cent also increased in most countries 
during this period (Ohlsson et al. 2008), **the increase in wealth inequality appears to 
have been generally weaker than that of income inequality. For example, in the USA 
while there was a mild increase in wealth concentration between the mid 1970s and the 
mid 1980s, and a further increase in the late 1990s, inequality then fell and the share of 
the top 1 per cent in 2001, at 33.4 per cent according to the Survey of Consumer 
Finance, did not differ much from the share of 33.8 per cent in 1983.**

The definition of Capitalism in the proper sense of the term is control of production through the ownership of Capital, we're not in ""Crony Capitalism"" because this is simply exactly what the world looks like when those who profit from industry are an extremely small class of people who happen to have arbitrary pieces of paper entitling them to the work of others, our land and our resources.

What Marx advocated instead is Socialism which rather than being control of production through the ownership of Capital instead production is run democratically by all involved.

This means rather than a small board of directors deciding how a firm operates, where the goods and produced, how they are produced and how the profits are spent instead all the workers get together and they make these decisions and they appoint the managers.

Economic democracy, thats what Socialism is, and this changes everything because the workers wont be as quick to pollute their own air and rivers without the comfort of living far away, because the workers wont decide to pack up their factory and move it to some other nation because wages are a little bit cheaper there, because the workers wont destroy needlessly ruin their own conditions that those in Capitalist firms have to strike and unionize for in vain and most importantly the workers wont decide to divert absolutely exorbitant amounts of profit away from the firm so as some person with a magic piece of paper can enjoy a cruise around Barbados.

Its all still a free system, there's no government bureaucrat telling these workers what to do, no extra regulations controlling ""the market"", no raise in taxes or spending by the state.

The Italian court system has not been changed for this trial has it? They are following their known and accepted trail procedures. Does the US have a history of claiming that the Italian court system is unfair? 

It isn't even like she's facing a death penalty. She's facing 20 years, maybe as much as 26 years if they don't give credit for time served. 

I find it really hard to understand how someone can be so confused in any interrogation as to admit to being in the house at the time of the killing (admit hearing the girl screaming) and then try to accuse a person who was not there of the killing itself. This is not a person who's told the same story from the very beginning. 

Even now, when she's interviewed, you can see the PR coaching that she's had. But, in those initial days (before coaching), she was presenting as a strange cookie (e.g. doing splits in a waiting police waiting room?).

Snowden has no (alleged or convicted) body count and has been nominated for awards by other countries for what he's done. Snowden's first duty was to defend and protect the constitution that clearly does not permit the Federal Government to collect information on US citizens who are not under suspicion. He may eventually stand trial for what he's done. But, he has not been convicted in any court of law.

I just don't see the US telling the world that Italy's courts don't matter at the same time as they're trying to get Snowden extradited unless Amanda's parents are using the money from the book deal to buy off legislators. 

Amanda's attorneys have a response to the conviction and there is another phase left to go. If at the end of all that, they find her guilty, then she should be extradited.

Why you are not in debt is not important. This is not a moral issue, nor its about you. The fact remains that the vast majority of people are in massive debt, and there is massive private debt (both corporate and private) that needs to go away. 

&gt; And what about my pensions? You don't care?

Pensions are going to be fine, they can increase as well (and they will increase). Pensions can actually be part of the effort to increase inflation, as they can be boosted pretty easily. 

Past cultures used to just erase debts (Sumerians first I believe) every so often to balance this trend of over-accumulation of capital. Germany as a nation had massive debt reduction and inflation was used in the past continuously from western governments to erase debts.

E' già successo in passato (per stare in tema, la ghigliottina è stata introdotta proprio come elemento di contrappeso in seguito all'introduzione del divieto di ripresentare un decreto legge scaduto nella stessa formulazione originale) e non ci sono preclusioni perché possa accadere ancora. Se le regole sono queste (e se la loro catena di controllo funziona), pretendere che il comportamento del governo cambi per una questione di etichetta ha poco senso

* Opposizione - Se la mettiamo così però entriamo nelle opinioni personali, dove vale tutto e dove - conseguentemente - non vale niente. Partire dal presupposto che l'opposizione non ci sia comunque perché tanto il consociativismo regna sovrano equivale ad arrivare alla conclusione che all'opposizione potrebbero essere in dieci o in trecento e non cambierebbe niente perché tanto è tutto un magna magna. Di nuovo, quello del partito unico dell'inciucio è un mezzuccio che serve a Grillo per far passare il concetto del Cinque stelle unica opposizione e guadagnarci i voti di chi il consociativismo serio, evidentemente, non lo ha mai visto nemmeno in cartolina.

* Legge elettorale - La bozza di legge elettorale attualmente in commissione è già frutto del lavoro parlamentare (rispetto all'accordo base già sono stati cambiati dei dettagli). Ora della fine, se arriverà, il Parlamento sarà intervenuto su una miriade di altri aspetti esercitando pienamente il proprio potere. Che la riforma abbia preso l'avvio da un accordo tra due leader di partito che, per vari motivi, non sono in Parlamento non significa che le Camere siano state scavalcate (altrimenti questo discorso andrebbe fatto per ogni proposta di legge di origine non parlamentare) o che i loro poteri siano stati compressi in alcun modo: alle proposte già depositate in commissione se ne è aggiunta un'altra su cui i partiti hanno fatto convergenza e su cui ora stanno lavorando. 

* Ghigliottina - Anche qui, siamo alle opinioni personali: per alcuni la ghigliottina è opportuna, per altri no.

 If the United States is both mediating negotiations between the Ukranian Government and protest leaders, and throwing it's weight behind pressuring the Ukrainian government to concede to democratic reform through the threat of sanctions and promises of financial reform, it's only prudent to ensure that competent opposition leaders are at the forefront of the negotiations taking place, and the reform being instituted, as both incompetence, or opposition leaders tainted by some of the more extremist factions of the protesters, could end bad or worse, kill any hope of reform.

Tübingen is certainly the go to college town in the area, maybe besides Freiburg IF you can bear German hipsters or ""green"" people to be more precise (Also means that food prices in the city center are fairly high, lots of organic food stores there though). I has a very nice historic town centre and lots of little cafes to enjoy your day. On the other hand Stuttgart is certainly the bigger city with more stuff going on and moving around is a lot easier due to the existing city train system.

The international community in both cities is rather small from my experience, but that also means that it is easier to get into contact with ""local"" students, exspecially if you can get student housing because: As an exchange student you should be eligible for student housing in both cities! You should certainly send a mail to the Studentenwerk to ask if they have rooms reserved for you. While annoying for German students it could make it a lot easier for you to find a place to live.

As for your bayrisch accent... Don't worry, most of the students can't speak schwäbisch themselves, both cities are overrun by people from other parts of Germany.

Quick side note as a economics and egnineering student myself: BW has no renown faculties in that field! While the education there is as good as it gets in Germany if you want academically acclaimed universities go for Mannheim or Munich.

true,sad_sand_sandy,DENK,Denmark,"Wherefrom have you the knowledge that Sweden became such an equal society due to free markets? I am personally under the impression that the free market helped the Swedes to create wealth, and their Social Democracy was the factor creating economic equality. I am also of the impression that what has created the current rising economic inequality in Sweden is the fact that the liberal government has implemented a lot of neo-liberal policies. The same is happening in my native Denmark now, and it's a commonly accepted fact that it will inevitably increase inequality. Whether that's a bad thing is what's being discussed.

Regarding your point about Karl Marx: He didn't advocate an utopian society beyond ""ultimate freedom, happiness and well-being"". That's almost literally as far he would go when writing about the society after capitalism. He was definitely afraid to say what would come after, because he just didn't know. 

I'm sure you're able to find quotes by Marx saying what he thinks it'd be like, but overall he wrote remarkably little about the communist/socialist utopia. What he wrote a lot about was the capitalism he could see around him and how it historically had affected the world. He simply extrapolated the trend in his works. I personally find it pretty incredible how poignant his works are. In general he has been correct about his ""predictions"" so far, and he continues to be scarily relevant to this day.

I also cannot see how you believe that the world society is not in danger of becoming unsustainable? You've said yourself that 50000 Indians are lifted out of poverty weekly (it sounds like an unbelievable number to me, but no matter). That's precisely what capitalism is good for. But what happens when we have 9 billion ""rich"" people on the planet who all want the same stuff? Marx predicts that economic inequality will inevitably rise to a point that **something** has to happen. That's (basically) how he argues capitalism's unsustainability.

I'm saying all this not as a marxist, but as an admirer of his genius. I really feel it's a shame so many only think of Soviet Russia when marxism is brought up, because that country's ideology was not what Karl Marx was thinking of.",0,1391893084,null,0,false,0,cfaevcu,t3_1xcmce,t1_cfaevcu,t1_cfadnrq,null,1432312225,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Prinzipiell sind DogeCoin und Bitcoin ähnlich. Sie unterscheiden sich nur in bestimmten Parametern z.B. der sogenannten Proof-of-Work Funktion und z.B. wie viele Münzen werden generiert und wann diese generiert werden. Der Wert kommt einzig und allein durch soziale Konstruktion zustande. D.h. wenn genügend Menschen der Münze einen Gegenwert in Euro oder $ oder einer andere Kryptowährung zugestehen, dann gibt es einen Markt und einen Kurs. Dies passiert in den Exchanges. Die Exchanges sind technisch nichts neues, die meisten sind eher lausig implementiert und haben mit dem kryptografischen Protokoll von Bitcoins/DogeCoin nichts zu tun. Das ist sozusagen identisch mit z.B. Forex-Handel zwischen EUR/USD.

true,Quebe,IREL,Ireland,"The problem is this ""democratic"" aspect of Capitalism you talk about doesn't work out in the fact that it is not at all one person one vote rather some people get a great many votes and some people get practically none, and while the markets may be free in some semblance in the beginning as inequalities develop the people at the top use their superior resources to ensure the market is no longer free.

Why? Because doing so is clearly extremely profitable, the very market forces you celebrate and the very forces that undo the very existence of markets themselves.

So while yes people can set up democratic firms in todays system their attempts are always undermined by the superior resources of the already existing Capitalist firms, they will be bought out, pushed aside and undercut by economies of scale far outside their capacity.

I can not for instance simply buy Oil from a firm I can trust because all of the Oil industry is controlled by a short list of Oligarchs who work in great unison while pretending there is some sort of competition or market underneight. 

Because large Capitalists don't work in markets they work in networks, the people who own BP own Shell and the people who own Shell own Exxon, they all have the same interest in supporting each other and keeping anyone else out, they all share the exact same interests because this is how class relations operate, its just a big web with a spider in the middle and that spider is Capitalism in its raw and ugly form sucking the blood of us who support it and sewing a veil so many like you lose sight of what really lies beneath this so called ""market"".

A free society can only be one that is free of class relations, where all men and women stand to share the same ability to benefit and control how the decisions in our society are made, both political *and economic* a the two are always inseparable, and this is only possible by completely changing the mode of production.

The fact is that the poorer you are, the harder you'll find it to get out of poverty, and not only for economic reasons, but social reasons aswell. Look at people from ghettoes. They struggle. They struggle to the point that they can find it hopeless. How can they find a way from this parallel society to the more established Danish society?

true,I_am_Norwegian,null,null,"I really should start to bookmark the stuff I read and watch. I remember reading something about Marx's predictions recently, I'll see if I can find it.

I first read about countries economical history wherever I could find it. Articles, youtube videos, studies, academic papers etc. I also recently watched a documentary on NRK (Norwegian State Channel) which confirmed my beliefs. 

Super equal is hyperbolic, but the difference between the average citizens weren't big. The distribution of wealth was very good in other words.

I'm not surprised you believe that those scary neo-liberal policies have all the blame for this. Just like we all believe that whenever something is wrong in Norway economically, we just have to vote in the opposition , or whatever party we favor, and all will be well. The truth, or at least something closer to the truth is that nothing really changes. It remind me of a quote from the 20's: ""The business of progressives is to make mistakes, and the business of republicans are to keep these mistakes"". 

And so, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Sweden saw its economy rapidly industrializing, driven by the many Swedish inventors and entrepreneurs.

During that time, Sweden produced extraordinarily many inventions, given its small population, including: dynamite, invented by Alfred Nobel (who established the Nobel Prize); the self-aligning ball bearing, invented by Sven Wingquist (who used this to create the SKF company); the sun-valve, invented by Gustav Dahlén (who used it to found industrial gas company AGA); the gas absorption refrigerator, invented by Baltzar von Platen (which was later used by Electrolux).

In addition, there were countless non-inventing entrepreneurs during that period: car manufacturers Volvo and Saab, and telecommunications company Ericsson. Indeed, with just a few exceptions, nearly all large Swedish companies were started during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which was not only a period of strong growth, but also the time when the foundation for later economic growth was laid.

Another factor which continued Swedish prosperity was the fact that Sweden was able to stay out of both World Wars, and indeed all other wars as well. Sweden is in fact the country with the longest consecutive period of peace, having fought no war since 1809, when Sweden was invaded by Russia, losing Finland to the invader.

 As a result of its free market policies, the resourcefulness of its people, and its successful avoidance of war, Sweden had the highest per-capita income growth in the world between 1870 and 1950, by which time Sweden had become one of the world's richest countries, behind only the United States and Switzerland, and Denmark (who have since also fallen behind because of high taxes).

But the foundation for future trouble had already been created. In 1932, the Social Democrats rose to power in the face of the Great Depression. And like FDR in America and Adolf Hitler in Germany, they started to expand government power over the economy. Until 1932, government spending had been kept below 10% of GDP in Sweden, but the Social Democrats, under their leader Per Albin Hansson, wanted to change this and remake Sweden into a ""folkhem"" (""people's home""), a term Swedish Social Democrats adopted from the Fascists in Italy.

Even in the early 1950s, Sweden was still one of the freest economies in the world, and government spending relative to GDP was in fact below the American level.

But between 1950 and 1976, Sweden experienced an expansion in government spending unprecedented during a period of peace, with government spending to GDP rising from about 20% in 1950 to more than 50% in 1975. Virtually every year, taxes were increased while the welfare state expanded relentlessly, both in the form of a sharp increase in the number of government employees and ever more transfer payment benefits.

During the first 20 years, this relentless government expansion took place seemingly without ill effect, as Sweden benefited from rapid global growth — although Sweden's growth had already started to slip in relative terms, from well above average to just average. This changed in the 1970s after Olof Palme, from the left wing of the Social Democratic party became Prime Minister. Palme stepped up the socialist transformation in Sweden, rapidly increasing anti-business regulations and sharply increased payroll taxes.

The payroll-tax increases, along with increasing wage demands from unions, made Swedish businesses highly uncompetitive on the global markets, something which Palme decided to solve by devaluing the Swedish krona. As a result, price inflation rose sharply, leading to repeated devaluations. Popular discontent from the economic woes created by the global economic downturn, the massive tax increases, the increased regulations, and the increasing inflation enabled the center right to come into power in 1976, breaking 44 years of uninterrupted Social Democratic rule.

The Social Democrats returned to power in 1982. They immediately implemented one ""big bang"" devaluation of 16%, which they claimed would be the last. They had claimed the same thing before all the previous devaluations, including the 10% devaluation that the center-right government had decided upon the year before. This time it appears that they actually meant it, but as with The Boy Who Cried Wolf, no one believed them.

Inflationary expectations and thus union wage demands remained very high. And in 1985, the government decided to deregulate bank lending. While this reform was necessary in order to improve capital allocation, it had disastrous side effects given the fact that at the time, real interest rates were way below zero after tax and inflation. This caused a massive credit expansion, which in turn helped further aggravate consumer price inflation while also creating a massive stock- and real estate bubble. As the exchange rate remained fixed, Swedish competitiveness was quickly undermined.


After Palme was killed by an unknown assassin in February 1986, pragmatist Ingvar Carlsson became prime minister. Worried that Swedish growth had trailed most other countries, Carlsson's government implemented a number of free-market reforms. Among these were the lifting of all currency controls in 1989 and a tax reform that dramatically reduced marginal tax rates (although they also reduced a number of deductions, including deductions for interest payments). Although these reforms have arguably contributed to improving the long-term economic performance of Sweden, they would contribute to precipitating the deep economic downturn in the early 1990s.

Meanwhile, as the economy started slowing significantly in 1990 after a series of tightening measures, consumer price inflation slowed. With the combination of continued high nominal interest rates, reduced capital gains taxation (and with that, reduced deductions for interest payments) and falling price inflation, real interest rates started rising significantly, helping to end the asset price bubbles. On top of all of this came the oil price shock following Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and an economic downturn in key trading partners such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Finland. The end result was that Sweden slipped into a recession in late 1990.

As Sweden fell into a recession and its highly cyclical government budget balance started to deteriorate rapidly, investor confidence in the Swedish fixed-exchange-rate scheme started to deteriorate rapidly.

And with currency controls abolished a few years ago, the krona was fair game for currency speculators. Unlike in the past, the government was determined not to devalue, and they deemed a return to strict currency controls as unthinkable, so they had no choice but to defend the currency by raising interest rates. But as the currency speculators knew that these interest rate levels could not be sustained, they renewed their attacks, knowing that their gain from a collapsed currency regime would be far greater than the interest rate levels the Riksbank could offer. The end result was that real after-tax interest rates were pushed up into double digit levels — after having been negative just a few years earlier. That in turn deepened the recession further.

In the end, though, the fixed-exchange-rate scheme collapsed in November 1992. The dramatic increase in interest rates and the deep recession had at the same time created a large amount of bad loans, making almost all major banks in effect bankrupt. (The exception was Handelsbanken, known for its more cautious lending practices.) Only after the Swedish government pledged they would bail out the banks with whatever money they needed was a widespread banking collapse averted.

All told, the recession became Sweden's deepest by far since the Great Depression, with GDP in 1993 being 5% lower than in 1990, with employment falling more than 10%, and the budget deficit rising to more than 10% of GDP. By then Sweden had fallen to between 15th and 20th place in international income comparisons, a decline from which it has never since recovered.

I don't believe in democracy. I don't think something is right because more people believe in it. I don't think there is a way to combat rational ignorance. I don't think there is a way to get politicians to be honest without taking votes out of democracy. I don't think it's a functionally, or ethically good system. 

Actual change is almost impossible, because the people in power already control every step of the process for getting into power, so if you have significantly different views, however amazing, actually trying to change anything is about as plausible as joining the mobs in the hopes of getting them to stop their involvement in drugs, prostitution, gambling, racketeering and extortion.

Democracy is not peaceful trading and sharing under property rights, but a forceful grab of security and arbitration in a certain area by a central power. Public voting then determines who makes and interprets the rules. So what happens is that everyone tries to use the rule-making power of the state in their own advantage. It will be a constant push towards the erosion of the freedom to produce, own, trade and act, and very little in way of holding it back.

Democratic representatives (who have term limits) have every incentive to loot the public treasury to meet the short term interests of their cronies. Even monarchs have a more sensible incentive structure, in that if they loot a society too much, they'll just be harming their own kingdom, and leaving nothing for their heirs.

Under democracy then, you see a round-robin looting effect, in which parties trade looting opportunities every several years. Democratic rulers don't have long term incentives to maintain the health of the societies that they gain temporary stewardship over. 

David Friedman gives a great argument against the decision-making process of democracies in Machinery of Freedom by explaining how democracies cater to special interests.

It is worth a tremendous amount of time and money for you to gain and protect this handout, while it is not worth the time of the average citizen to fight it.

Why? Begging was banned, but there where several loopholes. The Romani gangs are surpisingly well organized. They registered within days, as required, and now they didn't beg, they held up magazines and pretended to sell them. No magazines ever changed hands, because they each only had a single one which they used for months or even years.

The Roma held out for about two more years, but there seem to be far fewer of them now. I have no idea why, it has happened very recently, but it definitely is not related to the begging ban.

&gt;After Roman rule, Sicily was conquered by the Ostrogoths, and then by the Byzantines. However, after Byzantine rule, Sicily was conquered by Arab and Berber peoples, resulting in the introduction of Islam into Sicily. The intermixing of indigenous Sicilians with Arabs and Berbers did not always transmit Islamic culture to the people as many held on to Christianity as a symbol of defiance, though relatively positive social relations remained between Sicily's Christian and Muslim communities. After the period of Arab rule, the island was conquered by Norman warlords. The Normans brought a new addition to Sicilian ancestry, forming a unique Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture. During the subsequent Swabian rule under the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who spent most of his life as king of Sicily in his court in Palermo, the Islamic element was progressively eradicated till the massive deportation of the last Muslims of Sicily. As a result of Arab and Berber expulsion, many towns across Sicily were left depopulated. **By the 12th century, Swabian kings granted immigrants from northern Italy (particularly Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria), Latium in central Italy, and the south of France settlement into Sicily, re-establishing the Latin element to Sicily, a legacy which can be seen in the many Gallo-Italic dialects found in the interior and western parts of Sicily, brought by these settlers.**",0,1391896037,null,0,false,0,cfag14b,t3_1xbs7q,t1_cfag14b,t1_cf9x5ia,null,1432312838,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Because the German civilians were fleeing the Soviets due to a reputation for mass murder: whether the reputation had been built on the corpses of murdered Poles or murdered Germans is of no consequence to its propaganda power. The Germans saw the Soviet Union as an indiscriminately murderous regime: the fact that the German authorities used the evidence of the Katyń massacre as propaganda to their own citizens indicates that German citizens saw the mass-murder of Poles by the Soviets to be equally threatening to themselves.

Wenn du nicht weisst wie es technisch funktioniert, kannst du relativ leicht abgezogen werden. Es gab den Fall einer Bitcoin-Lotterie (du schickst ein paar Bitcoin hin, wenn du gewinnst bekommst die 1.x-fache Menge zurück, wenn du verlierst meist gar nichts) die Transaktionen schon mit 0 Bestätigungen akzeptiert hatte. Die wurden clever ausgenommen. Nur die Transaktionen bei denen gewonnen wurde, wurden validiert. Weil das Bitcoin-Netzwerk Transaktionen mit hoher Gebühr eher validiert als solche ohne Gebühr. Die genauen Details hab ich auch nicht mehr im Kopf...

Wegen den Währungen an sich: Ein etwas krummer aber nicht ganz so abwegiger Vergleich sind Webseiten. Alle sind bei Facebook, ein paar waren bei StudiVZ, etc.pp ähnlich vermutet man gerade wird es mit den Kryptowährungen laufen.

Alles andere ist Community. Du musst quasi zuerst eine Community aufbauen, die einen der kleineren Exchange überredet die Münzen aufzunehmen, wenn du genug Nutzer hast steigt der Preis. Hype/Marketing tun ihr übriges. Daher ist auch DogeCoin so beliebt... ist eine interessantes Beispiel für Marketing und Psychologie. Auch die Anzahl und der Wert der Münzen. Ich hab z.B. 88000 DOGE - geil oder? Sind aber nur etwa 150$ im Moment... klingt aber viel schöner als 0.2 BTC.

European banks even used the Bank of Switzerland as opposed to the ECB, because the BoS didn't force disclosure. So shareholders of large European banks weren't even aware they were being bailed out, and the Fed wasn't aware of where its zero interest loans were going (or their ability to pay them back). Most of these loans did go through the ECB though. 

That said, this didn't have much to do with Switzerland caving. The US (and French, German, British) governments put pressure on Swiss banks to disclose their customers. The IRS had evidence Swiss bank subsidiaries in the US broke US tax law and illegally transferred assets to Switzerland. So it was either maintain legendary Swiss secrecy and face hugely punitive penalties in the US, or disclose. EU countries have done the same thing.

Despite all you said above you totally miss is that the importance of Democracy is, its not about creating the best possible decisions its about ensuring that all decisions are legitimate and accountable when they are imposed on others, and when you have businesses today employing millions with zero avenues of input in the decisions that affect their lives deeply this is simply unacceptable that a handful of people lay claim to the power over their entire communities and livelihoods.

Because these decisions have to be made, they don't just spring out the market like a little pixie on the shoulder of every CEO they're made by actual humans.

You claim that the people in charge of businesses should be whoever was lucky enough to win lifes game of musical chairs to end up with the magic ticket which decrees them to be a dominant share holder, with all the power to do what they like no matter who they are with all the facilitites, land, and work forces that our dear Father the Market granted them.

Or I claim that instead we let the people who actual work in the firms take charge of them, because these people are guaranteed to care if their job exists in five years time, who don't simultaneously own their competitors firms, who are actually involved in how the things they create are made.

But no I'm sure these inbred scum who hire someone else to choose which firms they should invest in with the money from their great-great-grandfather's slave plantation are the better class of people to be in charge of our societies production than those who are actually at all involved in the processes.

I'm sure left to their own devicies to horde all they want and horde as they do, as they slowly come to own every patch of dirt on this planet in an ever shrinking pool of hands we'll have a free society, I'm sure the state will not exist as these people come to control all around us, but no you're being punched square in the nose and you blame the glove and celebrate the fist.",0,1391899167,null,0,1391900167,0,cfah8qr,t3_1xcmce,t1_cfah8qr,t1_cfafnz8,null,1432313409,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I would argue otherwise. The Eurocrisis has been different because the Member States themselves, not the Commission etc. have been responsible for it.

Contrast this with Commission efforts to punish nations for being out of line. France and Germany saw no punishment in the early 2000s for breaking budget rules.

Employees have a say, what are you talking about? If they are treated badly, they will leave. If their company is run poorly, they can start up their own and take over the market in that area. They can unionize and band together that way. Consumers can choose to shop wherever they want. If enough people stopped shopping at walmart, it would fail. If enough people stopped buying burgers at McDonalds, they would fail. 

Furthermore, if you lay off protectionist policy, bankers, CEO's, management and all the other evil burgiouse oppressors would be liable for whatever damage they've caused. 

You're ignoring what I'm actually saying in favor of straw men. The market isn't magical, it's made up of people and their individual decisions. This turns into an extremely efficient and responsive system, contrary to democracy. 

The people in charge of businesses aren't ""lucky"", they didn't win a ticket or any other prize that magically allowed them to get where they are. Most of them worked hard for years, most of them, and all of them under free markets give people something they want more than what the businessman is asking for financially. That is how you succeed, by making people happy, by creating wealth.

Ich denke die Lektion, die man aus solchen Geschichten ziehen sollte, ist, dass es eben Open Source und von Experten gemacht sein sollte. Dann können Fehler überhaupt erst gefunden und von anderen Experten geprüft werden, ob das alles tatsächlich auch so sicher ist, wie der Entwickler glaubt.

Gerade bei Posteo sehe ich weder Krypto-Experten, noch Open Source, was  zugegebenermaßen bei einem Web-Dienst in der Natur der Sache liegt. Aber damit bleibt es bis zur Einführung von Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung von Mails nur ein kleiner Schritt in die richtige Richtung. Und selbst dann sehe ich das gerade bei einem Web-Dienst der manipulierbar ist äußerst kritisch (Krypto serverseitig ist zwecklos, clientseitig technisch interessant).

Why am I so anal about this? Because arguing along these lines only strengthens the nationalist narrative. 

First, this is not spaceship Brussels taking revenge on the pesky natives out of pure evilness The EU is hundreds of millions of *people*. As I see it, EU is something we profit from. People might disagree. But when they want a different deal they will *naturally* have to pay a price, because in the end of the day, they demand the deal from *other* people who will want compensation for it. This is something the nationalists typically fail to mention. Second, this is not about *us* versus *them*, This is about *some* people in Switzerland who want a different deal and just because they use the buzzword *national interest* it is neither automatically a good thing nor in the interest of every Swiss and we should gang up with those who see it as we do and not brand them as *the Swiss* who don't like us.

&gt; anything less is a minority imposing their decision on others.

Someone hasn't heard of polycentric law. 

&gt;You say workers have a choice but this is a lie, all we have is one Capitalist firm or another and both are owned by the same people, you claim these people worked hard to be control of these firms but I'm sorry to tell you its not physically possible to work hard enough to be in a position of wealth and power thousands upon thousands of times more than the average person, there's simply not enough hours in a persons life and not enough strength and intelligence in the most talented people who have ever lived to justify this disparity in rewards.

Sure there is. I make a product that makes millions of people happy. Boom, I'm a millionaire, because I spend those years creating that product, and then all the work to get it trough and into the market. Yes, someone else might work hard as a bus-driver, but should he be payed as much as me, or should I have been payed as much as him? You seem to think that the only factor in labor value is time, and this is very, very wrong. 

&gt;The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, that's all it is and that's all it ever will be, if I have the wealth to hire thousands of people to tell me where to invest, to manage my firms for me, to do all the work in my production for me then how could any of these people or any ""individual"", as you laughably cling to, possibly hope to catch up with my wealth? Impossible, strictly so and utterly so and hence why the wealth gap clambers on further up upon our heads.

The universal cultural proverb that says ""shirtsleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations,"" is as old as writing itself. And when I say universal, I mean that it appears in every culture I have studied. Clogs to clogs, kimono to kimono, rice paddy to rice paddy, shirtsleeves to shirt sleeves. And it is a proverb that describes human behavior in terms of creating long-term families as failure. 

The theory of the proverb is that the first generation starts off in a rice paddy, meaning two people with an affinity for one another come together and create a financial fortune. They usually do it without making significant changes to their values, customs or lifestyle. The second generation moves to the city, puts on beautiful clothes, joins the opera board, runs big organizations, and the fortune plateaus. The third generation, with no experience of work, consumes the financial fortune, and the fourth generation goes back in the rice paddy. 

You see, wealth without protectionist policy, strangling regulations and seas of red tape and artificially raised entry bars is cyclical. 

Furthermore, if you actually give poor people a chance, they have every ability to undercut rich people. They lead extremely expensive lives. The poor do not, which allows the to sell at lower prices. And thus the cycle begins. 

&gt;So yes I will support the next Revolution which is coming I assure you of that, and if you and your piggish ilk stand against it I will absolutely support the due punishment you will wrought onto yourself for opposing progress and the world will be better for it, like a slaver being chased away with his own whip it will be absolutely justified.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"I answered yes to this. Or as close to yes as you can get.

Let me explain the rationale;

Statistics display that people of certain races behave in a certain way. This does not mean they are genetically predisposed to do that, but statistics generally do not lie. As opposed to a genetic issue, it's more than likely a cultural or enviornmental one.

Why do Muslims in France commit more crime? Not because they are Muslims or because they are North African, it's because they are generally working class and living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, which makes them more prone to committing crime. 

Why are blacks in America more prone to commit crime? There are significant cultural issues, where there are large sections of the black population which do not believe in working to the same level of white people, due to the fact they feel they are ""owed"" something. Compound this with the fact that black neighbourhoods are working class, a 50% unemployment rate, and that all middle or upper class blacks have moved to middle or upper class white neighbourhoods, the majority of the black population is raised in a place with a culture or gang crime, unemployment and poor academic achievement. The statistics would show that blacks commit more of almost every crime. It's not genetic, but that does not mean there are no reasons for it - again, culture and enviornment.

It's not that I'm racist, I take each individual that I meet on their merits, but if I were a shop owner I would keep up to date with the statistics and keep a wary eye on ""suspect individuals"", or if I were out late at night I'd be more careful to avoid areas with a high level of that sort of person.

Thankfully, Ireland generally doesn't have a race problem so it's something I rarely if ever need to think about.

true,sad_sand_sandy,DENK,Denmark,"First I have to say, I'm impressed by how quickly you wrote that up. I feel like it was posted within 10 minutes of my response to you, and it was a veritable wall of text even. Not bad!

Secondly, and more to the point: I don't plan on commenting on each and every step of this short history of the Swedish economy. Instead I'll just say that I don't dispute that the Swedish government - generally Social Democratic as you point out aswell - and their economic policies after the 2nd world war (or whenever you want to draw the line) were largely at fault for the country's problems during especially the 1990's. In Denmark we had our own economic problems during the late 70's and 80's. The problems stemmed from the governments reaching too far in too short a time span. This is not controversial information.

I do believe, though, that we were talking about what had caused Sweden to be one of the most equal countries in the world, which I cannot see how you answered. I guess what I can say is that I agree that the Swedish state (and Danish aswell) became too bloated for its own good, and the liberal policies implemented during the 90's in both Sweden and Denmark certainly helped them to get back on track to become more competitive in a global market and created jobs for the average citizen.

That happened during the 90's. The neo-liberal policies I'm talking about that have (and will) increase inequality are those the current Reinfeldt government have implemented, specifically the lowering of taxes and the substantial welfare service cuts. As I've said before, it's the same in Denmark.

I'm not a communist/socialist or whatever you want to call it, I recognise the improbability of such a system working as the world is at the moment. I'm however a staunch social democrat. That is to say I believe in the market just as well as you do, I just also believe in restraining (or controlling) the market. I don't think letting the market control itself (meaning no control) will lead to good things for the modern, western societies. I believe that just like too much government is bad - like you've written about - totally relinquishing control of the market is equally bad (for different reasons obviously).

As for your very last paragraph regarding Karl Marx: As I've said I'm not a batshit leftist, stalinist or anything like that. I'm very moderate, and I don't believe I'm saying anything controversial by stating my admiration for the works of Karl Marx. In fact I believe his position as a thinker has been ruined by the complete failure of Soviet Russia, and many people can only think of that and North Korea whenever marxism or its derivatives are brought up. He would *not* have been a proponent of that society, that is for sure. His actual thoughts are certainly not as controversial as they are put out to be. His place in political, economic, sociological, and philosophical history are with very few rivals. His contributions to (capitalist) economic studies (which we are discussing) are not questioned. He didn't even view capitalism as an evil system. In fact he very much saw it as a necessary system in societal development. If you want to talk about it, I'm open.

Also I'd like to comment on this quote from you:

&gt; And like FDR in America and Adolf Hitler in Germany, they started to expand government power over the economy. Until 1932, government spending had been kept below 10% of GDP in Sweden, but the Social Democrats, under their leader Per Albin Hansson, wanted to change this and remake Sweden into a ""folkhem"" (""people's home""), a term Swedish Social Democrats adopted from the Fascists in Italy.

This is a pretty ridiculous juxtaposition. Why don't you throw Stalin, Kim Jong-Il and Fidel Castro in there aswell while you're at it? Comparing the Swedish Folkhem with Nazism and Fascism is preposterous and serves no purpose in any debate.

true,I_am_Norwegian,null,null,"Okay. So when they intervened in the economy, it went fine for a while, as it always does. But then the effect of all that regulation and government interference caught up with them. To fix this, they inflated the currency, and held back wages. They did more than this of course, but this is the most relevant things they did, since it affects you disproportionately the poorer you are. In effect, they lowered the purchasing power of everyone, but if you were in the upper-middle class, this wasn't a huge, huge deal like it was for someone in the lower-middle class or in outright poverty. Then they inflated the their currency again, all the while trying to stagnate wages, a practice which last I heard, is still going on. Of course, this was supposed to be temporary, to try and revive some of that past glory. Instead they just widened the gap between poor and rich. Admittedly, they are doing better now, but they've still not fully recovered from something that could have been so easily prevented. 

It's the success of the free market that caused the equality. When efficiency goes up, prices goes down, and real wages increase. When economy is slowly deflating, your real wages continually go up. When taxes are low, your real wages are much higher, and business doesn't get to keep only 50%-30% or whatever of what they earn. You see, when you lose 100% of what you lose, and gain half of what you earn, you're not going to take risks like you would otherwise take. You're not going to expand and hire as many people as your otherwise would. 

There are thousands of other small things and individual polices and regulation, pieces of red tape, raised entry bars, tariffs etc. etc. that all accumulate into the joke of capitalism we have today. Everything results in less efficiency, in lower real wages, in the the cronies succeeding instead of the people who should. 

So we have this distribution of wealth we have now. So we have insanely low real wages, and we have economies where the busts are going to grow and grow until something changes. All the while some select few gain, and the rest of us lose.

Most of the good schools are state universities, which here in California one can enter via junior college, which gets higher priority than AP high school students.  But staying in it and getting out of it with a job is extremely hard nowadays.

These blocs will always be begging the West to support them, and they'll get it.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't buy the old 'nations rise and fall' argument - I don't think you can compare empires and kingdoms to modern democracies. Countries with rule of law and strong institutions keep power simply by virtue of attracting the best and brightest from unfree countries that are trying to rise - the unfree countries are basket cases now and will continue to be until they get with the program, no matter how many tanks and media networks they control. They can't conquer us, they can't afford not to trade with us, they can't keep their people from knowing how much better life in the West is, so they're fucked until they finally admit the inevitability of secular liberal democracy.

I dont necessarily buy the Fukuyaman argument but its argument that is made a lot and it does have merit. The only true answer of course will be played out in time. But being an ""unfree countries"" does not correlate with being a basket case. Authoritarian structures have been the bedrock for economic success for all the East asian economies. Japan with its taisho authoritarianism and its authoritarian militarisation and then postwar US control, which only ended once they were on a stable path of prosperity. The same thing occurred with all the East asian tigers which were run and controlled by authoritarian regimes. This only ended (in South Korea and Taiwan) after achieving levels of stable prosperity. And with Hong Kong and Singapore can still be argued to still be there. What those countries have realised is that democracy does not correlate with economic success. And the success of this realisation is what inspired China and its reforms from the late 70's, it's also what inspired southeast asia. 

In 2009 there were 1,9 billion people in the global middle class. By 2020 this number will be 3.2, by 2030 this will be 4.9. This ""middle class"" is the term used by OECD which describes people who have a disposable income of 20-100$ per day, which means consumers of large appliances and the ability to buy automobiles. Allow me to explore this a little.

[When in 2030](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22956470), 66% of the world's middle class is expected to be living in the Asia Pacific, with the majority of it consisting of China,  I think the argument of who can afford to not trade with who will be moot. [To expand](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2010/3/china%20middle%20class%20kharas/03_china_middle_class_kharas.pdf), North America will drop its share of the global middle class (2009) from 18% to 7%. In Europe it will go from 36% to 14% and in the Asia Pacific will rise from 28% to 66%.With the Asia Pacific share of middle class consumption rising from 23% to 59% by 2030. That will have a huge impact, you cannot argue about the leap forward in technological brilliance nations like South Korea and Taiwan have made. They have closely followed the example laid down by Japan, this is in turn is being followed closely by China. When the centre of economic power shifts, everything else may eventually follow.   

Industrialisation in the west did not occur alongside liberal democracy, this is a common fallacy. Victorian Britain was not a liberal democracy, it did not have universal suffrage, neither did a lot of its contemporary industrialised societies. This is where nations like China currently are, and where the leadership sees itself. Will they move and transition towards liberal democracy? That will probably be the case as a stronger middle class demands representation, but it will be in its [own characteristic way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing_\(Confucian\)). Like South Korea, like Taiwan. Deng Xiaoping, the leader of the Chinese reforms and now deceased paramount leader of China was quoted in 87 saying he expected China to hold elections in [50 years \(2037\)](http://www.chinausfocus.com/political-social-development/china-tiptoes-toward-democracy/). Currently under the Village law, all of the 1 million villages in China hold direct elections for their local leadership. They are of course subverted in many ways but the steps are in that direction, and as disposable income rises it is very likely that it will continue accelerating. It does not mean they will be liberal or even friendly with the west, afterall the largest democracy in the world is India and it can hardly be described as either.  

It's not really a nation falls and rises, its a nations relatively power and influence globally falls and rises. The consequence of globalisation and industrialisation that is finally occurring around the world means many millions are being lifted from poverty, it also means even many more are being torpedoed into affluence. It does not mean we will be driven into poverty, but it will probably mean we cant order other nations around like we have been able too in previous generations. We may not ""fall"" in the sense of entering chaos or achieving poverty, but there will be a noticeable fall in our influence and importance and that is what I am discussing. 

I suppose you understand this is all speculation, tomorrow may be the start of a new ice age. North korea may bomb everyone around them. China might collapse within itself. It may go to war. Anything can happen, but that is all unlikely. What is most likely to happen is a continued and stable economic transition from poverty to affluence as they begin balancing out high growth with per capita growth and consumption, mirroring what they have been doing for the past 30 years. In turn this will be coordinate alongside other developing powers slowly moving from middle income to higher income nations with larger economies.

Mainly Bulgarians and Romanians are looked down upon because off the assotiation with ""gypsies stealin' our stuff"". They migrated in quite large numbers after the collapse of the UdSSR. And that led to our well known problem with huge groups of migrants coming. Good ol' racism.

&gt;  Jobbik seems scary I must say

Definetly. They seem so much like the german NS-nazis. And they're close to power! 

&gt; Is the National Democrats of Germany going to become like Golden Dawn in Greece?

It doesn't seem so. Even in the parts of Germany with the most Nazis (east) they aren't strong (&gt; 5%). They're self-afflicted and have no real reach to the public. Most of the times they can't even march because of antifascists blocking the routes. 
However with their newly found topic of refugee-bashing they seem to have gotten quite the hang towards the ""normal society"". Many people will tell you that the Nazis ""aren't so wrong, after all"".
But this will rather lead to a shift to the right by the established partys (mainly the bavarian CSU who is in an Coalition with Merkels CDU trying to catch the far right by stating ""who cheats, flies out"") than to a rise of the NPD. 

&gt; Lol, but seriously, what is the gender gap there? 

There is one, and it is deep and wide. While the feminist movement has achieved a lot, there are still differences in pay based on gender, close to zero women in leading positions and -most importantly- still a huge sexist culture. On march 8th, there is the ""women*-struggle-day"" who will adress the ongoing sexism here (http://www.frauenkampftag2014.de/, there is a calling in english). 

&gt; Where are ya from in Germany and how do you personally feel about all this?

I'm from Berlin originally but now I've moved to a smaller city in the east, Halle (saale). 
I have to say I'm a little biased on the topic of refugees, as I have spend a few months supporting their struggle in Berlin and have gotten to know a few of them pretty well. 
The situation in Germany for refugees is pretty damn bad. Since 1992 the rights of refugees are hugely inflicted. They are not allowed to work, have private housing, learn german or to move freely. They are looked upon and are detained in former military complexes out in the nowhere. Shit'sfuckedupman.jpg

Seeing them rising up, not admitting to their fate but demanding a worthy living, was and is very, very inspiring. I do not know where refugees from all over the world that have fled their homes just to be mistreated by our system have the energy from, but I truly admire those fighters for this. 

Unfortunately, the german society as whole does not seem to agree to me. Many carry a fear of being overrun by foreigners, despite Germany having the lowest immigration numbers ever in 2007. You'll hear a lot of racial slurs popping up while discussing this topic.

One day I was sitting in the ""info-tent"" of the Oranienplatz, a public space that was occupied by the refugees, when a car stopped by. Big car, Audi. A man got out of the car, polo shirt, big watch. He went up to me and started to yell at me why ""they won't leave back where they came from"" and how ""they're all here to steal our jobs"". Mind you, this was in the middle of refugees, some understanding german. They told him to leave, but he didn't even seem to recognize them as he only spoke to me (the only white guy there).

It's based on the movie from 1977 directed by our Dutch pride Paul Verhoeven and starring our other Dutch pride Rutger Hauer. 

The movie was based on the autobiography from 1970 written by a Dutch RAF-pilot about his time in WW2 as a spy and as an assistant to the queen. 

The movie is online in Dutch and if you're in the UK I heard the musical is coming to London but I don't know when exactly.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Mainly Bulgarians and Romanians are looked down upon because off the assotiation with ""gypsies stealin' our stuff"". They migrated in quite large numbers after the collapse of the UdSSR. And that led to our well known problem with huge groups of migrants coming. Good ol' racism.

That brings up an excellent question: aren't Gypsies treated even worse in Europe than migrant laborers here in the US?  Even if they've lived in an area for generations?

Ironically the Fox News style stereotype here in the States is Europeans are anti-racist anti-bigoted ""liberals"" to a fault.

&gt;Definetly. They seem so much like the german NS-nazis. And they're close to power! 

I actually have considered trying to move to Hungary, that is if my father being Hungarian guarantees me citizenship, just so I can move to a better part of the EU right afterwards ;)

&gt;It doesn't seem so. Even in the parts of Germany with the most Nazis (east) they aren't strong (&gt; 5%). They're self-afflicted and have no real reach to the public. Most of the times they can't even march because of antifascists blocking the routes. However with their newly found topic of refugee-bashing they seem to have gotten quite the hang towards the ""normal society"". Many people will tell you that the Nazis ""aren't so wrong, after all"". But this will rather lead to a shift to the right by the established partys (mainly the bavarian CSU who is in an Coalition with Merkels CDU trying to catch the far right by stating ""who cheats, flies out"") than to a rise of the NPD. 

Reminds me of our Constitution party, which almost won the governors seat in Colorado and has had influence in other states (they're the KKK party that promotes a white only nation, more or less).  But doesn't the ND actually have seats in some German states, and is the rise of xenophobia and racism ever going to be a benefit for them?

&gt;There is one, and it is deep and wide. While the feminist movement has achieved a lot, there are still differences in pay based on gender, close to zero women in leading positions and -most importantly- still a huge sexist culture. On march 8th, there is the ""women*-struggle-day"" who will adress the ongoing sexism here (http://www.frauenkampftag2014.de/, there is a calling in english). 

So in Germany, is the pay gap myth an actual reality?  Because here in the US it's a bunch of bullcrap, well for the most part.  I say this as someone who considers himself a gender egalitarian and would prefer it promoted in American culture.  Actually, I'm curious, would you perceive Germany to be fairly egalitarian when it comes to gender, or not?  

&gt;Unfortunately, the german society as whole does not seem to agree to me. Many carry a fear of being overrun by foreigners, despite Germany having the lowest immigration numbers ever in 2007. You'll hear a lot of racial slurs popping up while discussing this topic.

You and others like you sound like Germans I can get along with (immigration is a passionate issue of mine).  But aren't Germans afraid of mostly Muslims coming in and making it the Germanic Caliphate or some other nonsense?

Again, it's weird, here in the US we think of Europe as too liberal on issues of immigration and refugees, again at least the mainstream media says this.

&gt;One day I was sitting in the ""info-tent"" of the Oranienplatz, a public space that was occupied by the refugees, when a car stopped by. Big car, Audi. A man got out of the car, polo shirt, big watch. He went up to me and started to yell at me why ""they won't leave back where they came from"" and how ""they're all here to steal our jobs"". Mind you, this was in the middle of refugees, some understanding german. They told him to leave, but he didn't even seem to recognize them as he only spoke to me (the only white guy there). Finally we got him to leave without violence though, even if he tried to punch me...

I actually don't know, for I do not know that much about the situation of migrant workers in the US (except that it's bad). They are frowned upon and there are a lot of stereotypes concering them but especially in Germany the can ""vanish"". If you speak fluent german most will just assume your parents are from turkey. So you can go undercover, but as soon as you're lifting the secret all the bad traits are back. Then you're stealing, and so on. 

Nowadays the most hatred rests on those Roma who just moved here, after Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU. They are seen as tribal, unsettled and thieves. Combine this with bad knowledge of the language and you'll have yourself the perfect minority to discriminate.

&gt; Constitution party, which almost won the governors seat in Colorado 

what the..? Never heard of them, to be honest. Sounds like a bunch  of idiots.

&gt;  But don't they actually have seats in some states, and is the rise of xenophobia and racism ever going to be a benefit for them?

They hold seats in two of 16 states. But they are far, far away from getting any power. In those two parliaments, all the other factions have collectively vetoed every single of their actions. They were even thrown out of the saxonian parliament quite a few times.

The rise of racism is not really helping them because it's not happening in their audience. Those who are turning racist wouldn't consider themselves far-right. They think of them as middle, with some value on tradition. Especially in the youth there is a rising wish to express yourself ""free from oppression by the leftists"". Maybe Fox isn't so wrong and there are more leftists here than in the US. For example Obama would be considered right-centered in Germany.

&gt; is the pay gap myth an actual reality?  

I just had my professor talk about the other day. There is an ""unexplained rest"" of the difference in pay between men and women amounting to 1,27€ per hour. This is the actual gender pay gap. These numbers are from the statistical office of Germany.

&gt; would you perceive Germany to be fairly egalitarian when it comes to gender

Not really. There has been a huge wave of feminism but I feel as if the society is shifting to an anti-egalitarian perspective. Many young people, even women, are opposed to gender equality because it inflicts with their view of a perfect family. Many are thinking of being oppressed by political correctedness and try to break through imagined borders. If you're expressing what you have always heard and said, you're not breaking borders.

&gt; immigration is a passionate issue of mine

Same here. There are some really cool groups in Germany who are supporting refugees for example translation at official bureaus etc.

&gt;  But aren't Germans afraid of mostly Muslims coming in and making it the Germanic Caliphate or some other nonsense?

Heard that many times. Some even think we already have that in the more diverse parts of the country and speak of a ""Parallelgesellschaft"" - a parallel society.

&gt; who do you think of as more racist then, Germans or Americans? 

I don't really have a scale here, but I think the racism in Germany is hidden behind curtain of education and good manners. But the thinking of ""them"" as foreign and scary is still here and deeply rooted. In the US however I think that racism is much more of a public issue, as there are more PoC who actually will speak up and are visible on the streets. Can't stress this enough: There are just few PoC here.

&gt; Fox News style stereotype here in the States is Europeans are anti-racist anti-bigoted ""liberals"" 

Well I guess if you put the US and EU side by side there are some social services etc here that are not enabled in the US (Until recently health care for everyone for example :P). But on migration policies there aren't that much differences I fear. 

The US lets the migrants die in the desert or at a fence, we let them drown in the mediterranian sea or get bombed to pieces by mines on the greek border.

seriously, though, I've never seen a bottle of vodka on the table, unless it was the only thing that was consumed, or the *main dish*. and, at least in my family, alcohol never makes an appearance until hours after the main meal, somewhere around the third dessert or so. and the times when I encountered five of them simultaneously were all weddings.


**edit**: take that back, I've seen plenty of bottles on the tables on my [*studniówka*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studni%C3%B3wka), that's scientifically interesting because there was supposed to be no alcohol and no one knew how it got there...

true,wordboyhere,null,null,"&gt; Denmark is not socialist. Sweden is not socialist. They are only socialist if you call any state intervention socialism. Socialism requires worker's owner of the means of production. Also, socialist paradise is a strawman.

I mostly agree with you. The Nordic/Scandinavian countries are not socialist, but some of their sectors are socialized. However socialism is not just limited to workers' ownership of the means of production(which would just be anarcho-socialism) but can be state control of the economy(state socialism). The [First International](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workingmen's_Association) was where the first major historical split began between simple worker ownership and state control(so that worker ownership may happen, depending on your view on the matter). 

I was just joking about the 'socialist paradise' bit. 

&gt;The whole world income inequality has risen (as you state in your last copy pasted paragraph). Whether it's worst in the US is irrelevant.

My last report linked addresses [most of the countries discussed by Picketty](http://www.yjs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thomas-Piketty-pres..pdf). I don't believe the inequality present in non-industrial nations that are going from not having an economy to having one is relevant to his thesis, considering they may see decreased wealth inequality over time, but initially don't. 

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States

The thing is, the way income is calculated is misleading, which I point out in my comment. [In this report](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/WorkingPaper-9.pdf), once accounting for health insurance premiums, it has decreased in the past few decades. The way total compensation is calculated is also misleading. Total compensation is adjusted for CPI, except for health insurance which is with PCE. Once a standard measure is applied that takes into account business costs(GDP): income doesn't decouple from productivity, and as a result income inequality has probably not increased as much as it has been reported to rise. The rising cost of health insurance premiums, which pose a burden for the employer and employee, are causing wage stagnation. 

Also yes, I think I remember reading somewhere that top labor incomes for the middle class have increased overall.
