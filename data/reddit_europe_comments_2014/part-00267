true,nieuchwytnyuchwyt,POLA,Rzeczpospolita Polska,"&gt;You wanna know who pushed for the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia? Not the Russians, no, it was the Polish government

It wasn't a Polish government. Unless you would consider the Quisling government during the WW2 a Norwegian government. Of course they pushed for invasion, they were afraid of their lives. 

The real and legitimate government of Poland was on exile in London since 1940, and remained there until 1990.

&gt;  the Polish Home Army that was insanely antisemitic

The Polish Home army saved more Jews during the WW2 than any other organixation in Nazi-occupied Europe 

&gt;and blamed the Jews for the Nazi-Soviet dual invasion

Are we in alternate history thread?

&gt;who refused to help the Jews during the Ghetto uprising

Who provided supplies and munnitions for Jewish insurgents and helped evacuate some of the leadera.

&gt;(Guess who did? Communists)

Yeah, the same ""Communists"" (bandits and USSR agents) who were providing Gestapo with informations and help against the Home Army and National Armed Forces. Such heroes.

&gt;and it was Polish people who suppressed other Polish people all during the Soviet era - even when the Russians told them not to.

Well, they were Polish Communists. That's exactly what you would expect from such scum.

&gt;You can try blame the Russians all you want but nothing's going to whitewash the reality that the Pact nations were their own entities, not simply puppet states of the Soviet Union

Totally. There was no Soviet occupation, no repression, the members of the ""government"" totally weren't Soviet agents who spent all 30's and 40's in Moscow, elections totally weren't falsified, Polish government in London was totally allowed to return to capital. God, I know how absurd it is to see a Communist in *2014* but I never suspected such people are *that* brainwashed. Well, I guess if that's unavoidable as there's no way a self-respecting man would support such outdated, vile and twisted ideology.

&gt; Of course, Western influence is purely fictional... All in my head. It's not like Poland is a memberstate of NATO 

Oh, such poor Spanish, Italian and Dutch people! They are in NATO too and are shovn damn Western influence down their throats.

&gt; that took part in the invasions of Iraq

We hoped for some good deals in Iraq after Saddam was toppled.

&gt; and Afghanistan

Every NATO member did so. That's how Article 5 works. 

&gt;and it's not like there are NATO bases going to be built in Poland or anything... 

Well, that's the exact fucking point of being in a military alliance with other countries.

&gt; It's not like NATO states are in an anti-Russian Alliance or anything

Countries sharing common enemies allying. Such thing never happened in the history of world before.

&gt; or that they constantly support American interests.

America is very liked in Poland (though I'll admit they don't top the rankings anymore like they used to 25 or 30 years ago). And they are our ally. Why wouldn't we support American interests as long as it benefits us too?

&gt;I find it hilarious that you have the cognitive dissonance to call Pact nations Soviet puppets but not say the same for NATO nations and America.

Well, probably it has something to do with the fact that Poland would have joined NATO in 1949 if it wasn't occupied by the Red Army at the time. And at last we did, at the first opportunity we regained our sovereignity. That's the only thing that makes sense for Poland in our geopolitical situation.",0,1410386592,null,0,false,0,ckes6g9,t3_2fz5i5,t1_ckes6g9,t1_ckei5m2,null,1427083952,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Tali individui li ritengo reponsabili delle pessime performance delle aziende italiane, in quanto sono loro che assumono e gestiscono personale sottopagato pretendendo 10 ed investendo 1. 

Esiste un clima truffaldino, corrotto, superficiale, che demoralizza i lavoratori e porta sfiducia verso i propri vertici delle aziende per cui si lavora. Cio' non fa altro che indebolire la fibra lavorativa costituita dai cittadini, e come conseguenza la qualita' di tali imprese e' discutibile.

Aziende italiane che assumono di sei mesi in volta e poi lasciano a casa personale qualificato per assumere incompetenti, droni, jar head, parameci, che servono solo a riempire posti e a fare il minimo indispensabile. Il tutto per un 'contentino' di stipendio.

Disprezzo tutti coloro che ritengono la forza giovane del lavoro come il lato debole della societa', e che le capacita' positive e dinamiche, per favorire un sistema borbonico che aborra ideologie nuove e premia il clientelismo.

In Venice there's a lot of nice corners, good restaurants, nice bars, it's easy to get away from the crowds and there are areas where you won't ever hear people speak Italian as everybody is greeting each other in Venetian. It is a very special city, where people have a particular way of life.

I think people who call Venice a tourist trap had wrong expectations and feel cheated. Like going to New York expecting to see Bob Dylan in a chat with Andy Warhol, walking around Times Square and declaring New York is a tourist trap.",0,1410390467,null,0,false,0,ckeu1un,t3_2g10jj,t1_ckeu1un,t1_ckemxs4,null,1427083078,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24
true,ydapps,null,null,"The short [answer has already been given by Aru21](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/2fwcvb/when_does_the_verb_go_to_the_end_of_the_sentence/ckdc4e6): substitute clauses.

In a main sentence, the conjugated verb is placed at second position, every other verb component at the end. 

&gt;
&gt; Ich  **muss** in die Schule *gehen*

In a substitute clause the conjugated verb just moves behind everything else:

&gt;
&gt; ..., weil ich in die Schule *gehen* **muss** 
&gt;

.
.

**The long answer:**

The position of verbs is probably the most important rule in the German language. Getting this right is a huge boost in how your language skills are perceived.

The ""verb"" part of a sentence can consist of several words. For all of these, you have a part that can change the position *[verb I]* depending on the context/sentence, and a part that will stay at the same position *verb II* at the end of the sentence. 

The **verb I** part is the conjugated part. It is the first word of the verb in a sentence with only subject and verb. 

E.g. *""gehen""* (go):

&gt;
&gt; Ich **gehe**.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **bin** *gegangen*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **muss** *gehen*. (with modal verb)
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** *gehen*. (future)
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** *gehen muessen*. (future + modal verb)
&gt;

Or for a verb that is ""trennbar"", e.g. *""ausmachen""* (as in ""shut down sth.""):

&gt;
&gt; Ich **mache** *aus*
&gt;
&gt; Ich **habe** *ausgemacht*
&gt;
&gt; Ich **muss** *ausmachen*
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** *ausmachen*
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** *ausmachen muessen*.
&gt;


___



**I. Main sentence**

The first word of the *verb* has the second position in the sentence. Every other verb (or parts of a verb) for this sentence is positioned at the end. It doesn't matter if the verb consists of several words, is ""trennbar"", or if you use modal verbs, or different times.

&gt;
&gt; Ich **gehe** in die Schule.
&gt;
&gt; Ich  **muss** in die Schule *gehen*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **bin** in die Schule *gegangen*.
&gt;
&gt; Gestern **bin** ich in die Schule *gegangen*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** in die Schule *gehen*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** in die Schule *gehen muessen*.
&gt;
&gt; Wann **muss** ich in die Schule *gehen*?
&gt;

The same is true if the verb is ""trennbar"". E.g. ""ausmachen"":

&gt; Ich **mache** den Computer *aus*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **habe** den Computer *ausgemacht*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **muss** den Computer *ausmachen*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** den Computer *ausmachen*.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **werde** den Computer *ausmachen muessen*. (future + modal verb)
&gt;

-

**I. b) Exception: Yes/No Questions and commands (imperative)**

For yes/no questions and commands the position of **verb I** part is changing to the start of the sentence:

&gt;
&gt; **Gehst** Du in die Schule?
&gt;
&gt; **Bist** Du in die Schule *gegangen*?
&gt;
&gt; **Musst** Du in die Schule *gehen*?
&gt;
&gt; **Wirst** Du in die Schule *gehen muessen*?
&gt;

-

And for a command:

&gt;
&gt; **Geh** in die Schule!
&gt;
&gt; **Mach** den Computer *aus*!
&gt;

-


___



**II. Connecting two main sentences**

You can connect two ""main"" sentences by words like ""und"" / ""oder"" / ""aber"". In this case, the single main sentence rule applies for each sentence separately (as if the word ""und"" would replace the dot). You can omit repetitions, but positioning stays the same as if the repetitions were present in the sentence.

&gt;
&gt; Ich **mache** den Computer *aus* und (ich) **gehe** in die Schule.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **habe** den Computer *ausgemacht** und (ich) **bin** in die Schule *gegangen*.
&gt;

Sometimes it can appear that this rule does not apply. You have to fill in the omitted words.


___



**III. Substitute clause: One sentence depending on another sentence or parts of that sentence**

Adding sentences that provide additional information about the main sentence (or an element in that sentence) change the position of the corresponding *[verb I]* to the end of that dependent sentence (substitute clause). Mostly this is done by using some ""glue"" words like ""wenn"" / ""obwohl"" / ""weil"" / ""dass"". The positioning for the main sentence stays the same as for a single main sentence:

&gt;
&gt; Ich **mache** den Computer *aus*, weil ich in die Schule **gehe**.
&gt;
&gt; Ich **habe** den Computer *ausgemacht*, weil ich in die Schule *gegangen* **bin**.
&gt;

Please note that the substitute clause can appear to stand alone. E.g. as an answer in a conversation. This, again, is an example for omitting a repetition:

&gt;
&gt; Vater: ""Warum *hast* Du den Computer *ausgemacht*?""
&gt;
&gt; Sohn: ""Weil ich in die Schule *gegangen* **bin**.""
&gt;

And an example for a relative clause:

&gt;
&gt; Der Junge, der den Computer *ausgemacht* **hat**, **ist** in die Schule *gegangen*.
&gt;

-

___



**And here comes the weirdest part:**

The rule to put the **verb I** at the second position in the main sentence is that strict, that it even applies when the first component is an entire substitute clause:

When changing the order of the sentences, this sentence
&gt;
&gt; Ich **habe** den Computer *ausgemacht**, weil ich in die Schule *gegangen* **bin**.
&gt;

becomes:

&gt;

1. Eigentumsaufgabe

Normalerweise gehört der Müll in der Tonne noch dem, der ihn dahin entsorgt hat (bei privaten Tonnen zumindest). Es gäbe jetzt allerdings die Möglichkeit die Lebensmittel quasi mit einem erklärten Willen der Eigentumsaufgabe irgendwo abzustellen. Wenn erkennbar, oder bekannt ist, dass es sich um eine Eigentumsaufgabe handelt, gehört es automatisch demjenigen, der als erster Eigentumsanspruch erhebt (der Containerer). Das ist zumindest legi generali. Obs da jetzt noch ein spezielleres Gesetz zu gibt, weil Essen, weiß ich nicht.

2. Schenkungsvertrag mit Ausschluss der Haftung aus Fahrlässigkeit

Man kann natürlich auch einen Schenkungsvertrag (nicht schriftlich, wenn man keinen Bock drauf hat) ausklamüsern. Beim Kaufvertrag würde es sich um einen Verbrauchsgüterkauf handeln, bei dem der Ausschluss der Fahrlässigkeit nicht so einfach möglich ist. Bei der Schenkung ist so etwas allerdings nicht geregelt. Daher wäre m.E. nach eine Schenkung mit Ausschluss der Haftung wg. Fahrlässigkeit möglich. Müsste sich nur jemand aus Aldi/Lidl/.../ finden, der befugt dazu ist, einen solchen Schenkungsvertrag mit Containerern zu schließen.

true,shozy,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;This linked article get's this so absolutely wrong. It is not the ECB who is owing anything in the TARGET2 system. The Maastricht treaty clearly forbits that.

The article says:  
""Eurozone banks maintain accounts with their country’s central bank. When an Irish bank writes a cheque to a German bank, the Target2 system deducts the Irish bank’s account at the Central Bank of Ireland and credits the German bank’s account at the Bundesbank. Technically, the Bundesbank incurs a new liability in the form of an increase in the value of the Bundesbank account of the bank cashing the cheque but this is offset by a claim against the ECB which appears as an asset on the Bundesbank’s balance sheet.""  

What part of that is against Maastrict? 

&gt;Of course, the secondary market is what I mean with buying government bonds directly. 

That makes no sense, before you said:
&gt;If the ECB buys government bonds directly, then this will increase the shared liability even more. And this directly violates the ""no bailout"" clause in the Maastricht Treaty. 

The ECB already does and has always bought government bonds off the secondary market. It's a key mechanism by which ECB controls interest rates. They're called [Open Market Operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market_operation). How does it violate the ""no bailout clause""? When the ECB buys debt that means governments owe it money, it doesn't mean it owes governments anything.

&gt;So it is effectively doing QE.

Yes effectively it is.

---- 

For your convenience here is article 123 of the TFEU which is the article that prohibits monetary financing, emphasis added by me:
&gt;Article 123

&gt;(ex Article 101 TEC)

&gt;1. Overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the European Central Bank or with the central banks of the Member States (hereinafter referred to as ""national central banks"") in favour of Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States shall be prohibited, *as shall the purchase* ***directly from them*** *by the European Central Bank or national central banks of debt instruments.*

&gt;2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to publicly owned credit institutions which, in the context of the supply of reserves by central banks, shall be given the same treatment by national central banks and the European Central Bank as private credit institutions.

And since you referenced it here is Article 125 the ""no bailout clause""
&gt;Article 125

&gt;(ex Article 103 TEC)

&gt;1. The Union shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of any Member State, without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific project. A Member State shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of another Member State, without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific project.

&gt;2. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may, as required, specify definitions for the application of the prohibitions referred to in Articles 123 and 124 and in this Article.

No. Le stime confermano che usciremo dalla crisi l'anno prossimo da anni e ormai s'è capito come vengono prodotte.

Il resto d'Europa è in stagnazione o in recessione con poche eccezioni, quindi di sicuro l'export (noi esportiamo prevalentemente in Europa) non ci aiuterà.

Klar kann man an der Stelle argumentieren, dass den Supermärkten dadurch Gewinn entgeht. Das stimmt aber nicht ganz. Durch den sinkenden Bedarf kauft der Supermarkt langfristig weniger ein und weniger wird weggeworfen (im Idealfall).

Es ist die richtige Art der Systemkritik. Wenn die Entscheider nur (und damit meine ich NUR) auf ihre Quartalszahlen achten und es billiger ist tonnenweise Zeug wegzuwerfen anstatt weniger einzukaufen, hilft nur eins: Boycott. Und den Fraß aus dem Müll zu klauen ist eine Art Boycott.

Ich würde das zwar selbst niemals tun, weil ich zu viel Schiss hätte erwischt zu werden. Ich mach dafür andere Sachen die nötig sind und sich sonst niemand traut.

Normandy for example has no separatist group that I know of.

It hardly even mentions anything slightly close to humble autonomist goals. As I've always said, there's hardly an area in France which is more French than Normandy, with its cheese and cows. Just because some Vikings settled there a thousand years ago doesn't make it a separatist region (because I'm assuming that's where the mention of Normandy in ""separatist"" regions comes from in those maps made by non-French people who have no idea).

Others in this map have utterly negligible movements which frankly don't deserve to be mentioned at all.

I was pretty young and a group of friends and I were passing through the city for one night on the way North. Internet reviews were not yet a major thing so I scanned through various local communities sites until I found a little English language thread about restaurants in Barcelona. Many locals recommended this little restaurant as a great place to eat, so up we went.

Of course we couldn't navigate the city unassisted and just fired up the GPS. The navigator took us through little streets and areas that were getting progressively less crowded and progressively more seedy. We were moving through tall run-down housing projects, getting funny looks from the locals and wondering just where the fuck we were being led or whether the navigator had gone haywire.

North Carolina is fast and doesn't indicate turns or look before they shift lanes, northern New Jersey has people dashing through the fresh red light so you wait a half beat before you go when the light turns green).

In Germany you can't go three to five seconds between scanning.  The person behind you who you didn't even see before is now rammed into your trunk.  If you want to pass someone, great, but pass and get out of the way because while you're focusing on that aspect someone has come up.

Als Ich die ISIS vernichtet a.k.a. ""zum Sieg gebombt"" hätte, gabs die ISIS noch gar nicht. Damals war das noch IS. Da hatten sie auch noch keine Ölfelder und konnten noch nicht den [5-fachen Sold](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/naher-osten/kaempfer-der-syrischen-opposition-vom-westen-verlassen-13140380.html) wie die FSA bezahlen und damit irgendwelche Penner anleiern.

&gt;Selbst die Verschwörungstheorie ISIS und FSA seien unterschiedliche Elemente wird hier wieder angeführt, lächerlich. Die FSA ist 90% ISIS.

Ach komm. Noch nicht gemerkt, dass die das Märchen hier keine Sau abkauft? Deine fake-Sub Youtube Videos kannste dir auch sonstwo hinschmieren. 

Die ISIL aus Syrien bestand bei ihrer Gründung zu maßgeblichen Teilen aus AQI und bestimmten, lokal begrenzten Teilen der Al Nusra-Front und sonstigen [dschihadistischen Splittergruppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War). Von der FSA hat die damals keine Kämpfer bekommen, aber später ist mal [eine Splittergruppe](http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2ad6z2/usbacked_moderate_free_syrian_army_factions_join/ciu55fd) übergelaufen.

Die als kritisch und ungehorsam bekannten Gruppen der FSA sind wenn schon zu der wahrscheinlich besser zahlenden Al Nusra Front oder Islamic übergelaufen, aber die bekommen eh keine finanziellen siginifikanten Hilfen, da die nur an die [vertauenswürdigeren Gruppen](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/naher-osten/kaempfer-der-syrischen-opposition-vom-westen-verlassen-13140380.html) gezahlt werden.

Und falls du es noch nicht gestrahlt hast, [jeder bekämpft die ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rebel_conflict_during_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Start_of_the_rebel_offensive.2C_ISIS_counter-offensive_and_mutual_advances). Selbst jeder Freizeit-Dschihadist hat Schiss vor denen. Das heißt die FSA unter dem National Council bekämpft mit der Al Nusra -mit der sie schon vorher einige Zusammenstöße hatte- und der Islamic Front die ISIS, und von denen bekämpft jeder Assad.

Jedenfalls ist es ein Kunstwerk eine Einheit der moderaten Opposition die gerade [ein comeback feiert](http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2fmd8o/what_is_the_current_status_of_the_free_syrian/ckamvbg) neben der allerdings etwas moderat-islamistischeren Islamic Front und Muslimbruderschaftals *so* dschihadistisch zu bezeichnen, dass einem die Al Nusra und der ganze andere Rotz nicht mal einer Erwähnung wert ist. Echt nice, keep it up.

""Morgens"" erkennen wir nicht mehr als Substantiv und wird deswegen klein geschrieben.

Nur an der Verwendung kannst du **keine** Unterscheidung erkennen, ob es jeden morgen passiert oder nur an einem speziellen. Der Unterschied liegt hier beim Tempus.

Wenn du sagen willst, dass es wiederholend eintritt, benutzt man das Präsens:

     Ich putze mir morgens die Zähne = Ich putze mir am Morgen die Zähne. (Präsens)



Wenn man eine einmalige Handlung ausdrücken will, nimmt man Perfekt/Präteritum:

     Ich habe mir morgens die Zähne geputzt = Ich habe mir am Morgen die Zähne geputzt. (Perfekt)

*Ob Perfekt/Präteritum spielt keine Rolle, solange du keinen literarischen Text verfassen musst*

It's so perfect, and what I would call ""very German"". You have full plausible deniability. You can just say ""well if the southern European countries could get their act together and read an economics book, then the currency would be valued properly. What can we do?"" 

The thing is, that Germany *always* knew that these countries would have problems with their economies. This meant that Germany *always* knew, when they were discussing the idea of a shared currency during the '90s, that this would be the case - and, precisely, that this would mean the currency would likely be artificially deflated which would in turn mean good things for German exporters and good news for the German economy. 

I mean, this scam worked so well, that Germany didn't even get hit so much during the 2008 recession. A little kurzarbeit here, a few Euros thrown over there, and home free! Riding waves. 

The question of how important Germany's scam actually is, to the current general bad economic outlook for Europe is debatable. But to say 

&gt;The euro does not seem to have anything to do with the current development.

seems to me to be basically flat out wrong. Also, no sources to back up this assertion. (I can give you the official US report on the situation, that Germany *slandered* as being 'incomprehensible', if you want a source from me)

For instance: They spent years trying to kill PC gaming with Games for Windows Live and trying to promote their shitty console that red ringed and you had to pay to play online on top of paying your ISP.


Not only that but they're coming into the phone market without any real tangible benefits for switching. Android will win out each and every time because of the apps, piracy and because it's an open source environment. Perhaps when smartphones and tablets get more powerful with Intels Broadwell chips Windows Phones and Tablets will be able to run native windows applications without a hitch and have a compatibility layer/skin that makes them usable on phone/tablet?


Nokia also might take off in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa because last I heard they've started releasing super cheap phones reminiscent of the almighty [one true god](http://static2.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/Is+the+nokia+brick+an+official+meme+now+_332a49aa7fb24a67add10e7513192070.jpg), I think this is admirable but realistically how the hell are they going to compete with chinese android manufacturers?

I said the opinion piece clearly states it is reporting what a local paper said *and* it is an opinion piece. So give as much weight to it as you want. 

It is a good idea to check the facts in any story. As I said, the BBC printed something suggesting Russia could have been in control of the BUK system when it shot down MH17. I doubt it fabricated the statements it was using, but that is not really enough to say for certain (although they were forthright with the evidence they had). 

The last point I think is worth making, is the fact that The Moscow Times sounds like the Russian version of the New York Times, or the Times of London, both of which are highly respected. If it is not a respected news source it will likely throw off a lot of Westerners. Although given the research I have done I certainly would not call it a tabloid. News outlets have an angle.

That is because he is being a little bit of a dick lately. He invaded and annexed part of a neighboring country, he is fueling a civil war in the same country (and he has likely invaded again). 

I will admit this sub has gotten a bit pitchforky lately, but that is because this hits close to home for many here, and lets face it, Russia has been in the wrong *a lot* in the past 9 months. But it does not mean people should ignore a lack of evidence when one exists. People were questioning the weight they should give that BBC article because of the lack of substantial evidence as well they should. 

But you are certainly right, there is an anti-Russia bias in the past 9 months. It happens when a country does something unpopular. If no country is doing anything too unpopular, people seem to take aim at the US. Look at how many on this sub considered the US ""imperialist"" for having military in Europe, now the tune seems to have oddly changed.

So dont worry, as long as Russia does not do anything else too crazy, people on here will be back to hating the US again in no time. Case in point, the top rated comment for an NSA article was ""USA is disgusting"" with hundreds of upvotes, when European programs came to light it was jokes or blaming the US for forcing them to spy on their own citizens. 

You can see it beginning already with TTIP. Canada's deal was negotiated behind closed doors and had an investor state dispute clause, but was welcome with open arms. A deal is being discussed with Japan behind closed doors and is almost guaranteed to have an ISD clause, yet both of those are welcome or not discussed. TTIP is touted as the end of democracy as we know it and synonymous with the evil Americans trying to take over Europe. This ignores the fact European companies invoke investor state dispute clauses more than American companies, but who needs facts when you're on an angry rant.

So like I said, dont worry, this sub will think the US is ""imperialist"" again soon enough. That notion has already gained quite a bit of traction for a fairly standard free trade agreement. So dont worry too much.

As you mention, the US is learning as well. Between the precision extraction of OBL, to Libya, or more recently assisting the Kurds, it is not taking such a guns blazing approach. It seems most world powers are learning. Especially if you look at ex-colonies, the European track record is pretty abysmal.

I don't think that works. I would be confused what *er* refers to when there is no male option available. You could replace it with *der Spinnenmann* (Spider-Man or possibly some werewolf like half man/half spider) or *der Spinnerich* (a male spider but it has a funny tone which may not fit your story but of course that can be subverted with enough cruelty).  

You already discussed that *fressen* can be used for humans as well. Especially if you want to point out an animal quality, greed, or poor table manners. For example there is a famous quote by Bertolt Brecht *'Erst kommt das Fressen, dann die Moral'* (Food is the first thing, morals follow on.) which is very much directed at human behaviour.  

In this spider attack scenario it's also possible to heighten the *fressen* by adding *mit Haut und Haar(en)*. It's basically a idiom meaning 'completely' and fits fairy tales very well.

*Eine riesige Spinne fraß sie mit Haut und Haar, und sie will mich als nächstes fessen!*

&gt;A simple device for preventing the accidental useage of a device. (e.g. plastic covers over fire alarm switches so that they can't be set off accidentally.)

&gt;The Jargon File defines a molly-guard as:

&gt;"" A shield to prevent tripping of some Big Red Switch by clumsy or ignorant hands. Originally used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an IBM 4341 after a programmer's toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice in one day. Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk drives and networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you'll see the much less interesting description “guarded button”.""

Le bilan de cette histoire c'est 

- N'achetez pas de poisson chez inter-marché, même si ils ont leurs flotte de peche, ils n'y connaissent pas grand chose

- Pour les sushi préferez le surgelé moins bon au gout mais moins de risque de vers 

- Gardez les yeux ouvert lorsque vous travaillez du poisson cru, en cas de doute gardez un plan B.

I mean, what, Greece was loaned tens of billions and now owes hundreds of billions? Money spent on German exports &amp; interest now owed to German banks?

So, Europe can fix this with quantitative easing to help balance out a undervalued German exchange rate &amp; overvalued European exchange rate, as well as fiscal transfers from Northern countries to Southern countries to help bolster the economy, shore up production &amp; stave off stagnation.

Oh, and on top of all this, you have Nordstream, signed into law by Gerhard Schroeder when he was German Chancellor, and constructed under his direction as a Gazprom subsidiary CEO after being given the job by Putin months after leaving office....thus having a gas pipeline built directly from Russia to Germany, isolating Eastern Europe economically, leaving them vulnerable to Russian bullying *(as we just saw when Russia cut gas to Poland by 20%, since Poland has been one of the most critical of Putin)* without it effecting Western Europe &amp; making Western Europe that much more reliant on Germany when discussing the flow of natural gas &amp; Russia.

Can somebody for fucks sake assure me that the European Union isn't about to turn into a *de facto* extension of the German state, with all of Europe arranged for the convenience of their export machine!?!?!

Sinnvolle Massnahmen, die im Einzelfall aber ganz neue Probleme aufwerfen (trotzdem sinnvoll).

Beispiel: Echtholzmöbel - je nach Holzart problematisch aufgrund natürlicher Bestandteile der Hölzer. Viele vertragen keine Terpene, deswegen ist z.B. Kiefer oft problematisch. Chemisch behandelte Hölzer (das ist die Regel) oft problematisch. Laubhölzer sind tendenziell besser, ein längerer Expositionstest ist obligatorisch.

Holz ist nicht gleich Holz. Das Thünen-Institut führte 2008 eine Untersuchung zum Emissionsverhalten verschiedener Holzarten durch. Die Holzarten unterscheiden sich zum einen sehr stark in der Art der Zusammensetzung der Emissionen, wie auch im Absolutwert der Gesamtmengen der jeweiligen Emissionsarten (teils mehrere Grössenordnungen).

Als die Krankheit bei mir ausbrach, durfte ich mich mehrere Monate *durchgehend* mit Durchfällen herumplagen.

Erst eine vorübergehende Ernährung mit auschliesslich Haferflocken beendete diesen Zustand.

&gt; Das ist fast unvermeidlich. Als rational denkender Außenstehnder ist es schwer zu begreifen

I can understand that refugees need to be helped, but I feel this way is not sustainable. If a country takes more refugees than its system can handle properly, then there will be even more problems in the future that can actually hinder on helping people in need in the future.

My view on taking refugees is that we have to have proper resources to take care of them, so that they will learn the language and the culture, so that they will go to an school to get education/update their skills, so that we will not end up with an permanent under class that is/feels secluded from the rest of the society.

The only political book I see there is Mikhail Khodorkovsky's book.

The only historical book 'Part of Europe. History of Russian State. From the roots to the mongol invasion.' by Boris Akunin, didn't read it but I don't expect it to be anti-Ukraine as the author is a huge oppositionist to Putin.

And the only Ukraine-related (not really) book is ""Crimea island"" by Vasily Aksyonov, an alternative histoy fiction, satyre of Russian and communist mores and values, and Western ones as well, written in 1979 and banned in USSR.

None of the books in the photo are somewhat popular. Some of the authors of them are also hosts on KremlinTV, so I suspect they write those books not because anybody buy them but because they are paid to write that crap, not as writers but as propagandists.

UPD: /u/3dom replied that it's e-books rating and it's irrelevant for the less tech-savvy population aka Putin's electorate but for some reason the comment was later removed. So I checked also ratings of printed books, still it's online shops as the easiest source of ratings for 2014:

In [ozon](http://www.ozon.ru/context/best_books/?bests=1&amp;store=1,0&amp;sort=bests), the largest Russian online book shop, there is one of anti-Ukraine books in top-100.

In [books.ru](http://www.kniga.ru/books/) there are two of such books in top-100.

It's good that you phrased it that way. Germany should keep in mind that it didn't always play the game as well as it does now and that it might not always play it as well in the future. In the former situation  the rest of Europe was forgiving  (literally) and in the latter Germany probably also doesn't want them to be too harsh.

The current policies are short-sighted, breed resentment and definitely not in Germany's long-term interests.

Anyways the thing with Finland and refugees is that we may have different ideas on to take immigrants and refugees as part of the Finnish society. In here it is more or less unacceptable that from a school class or from an neighbourhood more than 20-30% would be non-natives. The city of Helsinki already became alarmed when they found out that in some neighbourhoods some city buildings were mostly housed by immigrants. The idea is that when immigrants are surrounded and are in touch with Finnish, then it is easier for them assimilate and become part of the society.

Actually I looked a little more, in 2013 there were 3238 refugee seakers from which 1827 were accepted. I think that the thing that differentiates Sweden and Finland is that we have taken a much smaller quota of refugee to bring from refugee camps all over the world than Sweden. Finland could propably take a little more refugees, but not that much more. Even now we have trouble on organizing enough language classes, culture introduction and finding ways to bring the newcomers as part of the work force. 

By the way, the reason for why it is nowdays harder to make refugees/immigrants employed is that labor market has changed, due to automatisation the only two growing sectors of jobs are those which are either non-skilled or of those which demand high education&amp;high knowledge which usually refugeees don't have because the place they come are not developed countries with those industries.",0,1410423778,null,0,false,0,ckf6hyp,t3_2g2a88,t1_ckf6hyp,t1_ckf69zl,null,1427076118,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

&gt;

&gt;__Operation Barkhane__ is an anti-Islamist operation in Africa's [Sahel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel) region beginning in July 2014.  It consists of a 3,000-strong French force, which will be permanent and headquartered in [N’Djamena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%E2%80%99Djamena), the capital of [Chad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad).  The operation has been designed with five countries, and former French colonies, that span the Sahel: [Burkina Faso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso), Chad, [Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali), [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania) and [Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger). 

&gt;The operation is named after a [crescent-shaped dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barchan) in the [Sahara desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_desert).

true,vishbar,UNSA,American living in the UK,"The article reflects some pretty huge hyperbole on the part of the unions. Yes, the NHS won't be exempted...but ISDS settlements *cannot* simply sell off or privatise the NHS.

To give an example: imagine the NHS contracts with, say, Pfizer to develop a new medication for Alzheimer's. The cost of R&amp;D for something like that is *huge*. The NHS agrees to buy 10 million tablets at a cost of £1 billion if the drug is successful and passes some amount of clinical trials--thus giving Pfizer the financial security they need to start research.

Ten years later, Pfizer's drug has passed all the trials and is ready to be presented to the NHS. It met all the hurdles of the original contract. A new government is in power in Westminster, however, and they refuse to buy the drugs from Pfizer, leaving them with a huge financial loss. ISDS allows Pfizer to sue the government in an independent court over the breach of contract.

*Under no circumstances can ISDS change the fundamental structure of the NHS.* It allows investors to recoup some of their investment *if* they were treated unfairly. It's standard in any trade agreement--in fact, the NHS is *already* subject to ISDS claims from any of the many other trade agreements the EU has already signed--plus within the EFTA.

There is no mature party discussing the number of immigrants, they are afraid being associated to the anti-immigration party by doing so. That party is expected to get around 10% in this weeks election.

What is however discussed is how to integrate immigrants into swedish society more efficiently, but it is overshadowed by the shouting about humanism vs costs of immigration.

Unemployment in Sweden [is a bit above 7% in total](http://www.ekonomifakta.se/sv/Fakta/Arbetsmarknad/Arbetsloshet/Arbetsloshet/), which makes the situation much less worse than you would expect by reading this kind of articles. In fact, 5-7% unemployment is just fine since it makes it easier for companies to hire. Unexpectedly you need to at least speak swedish to get most jobs.

Criminality isn't a main thing either since we have one of the most generous welfare systems in Europe (which is obviously also why immigrants come here). See the graph at http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brottslighet_i_Sverige. It shows crimes per 100k people. Red are murders, green are sexual crimes (not only rape, which by the way is a pretty lose definition in Sweden). 

Reading about the situation paints you a picture where Sweden is getting swamped by rapes, murders and riots which obviously isn't totally untrue either since with more poor people you undeniably get more crimes in those areas. However, in the bigger picture (ie reality, and not some racist fantasy) that picture falls apart.

The important thing this upcoming week is that we do not vote back our more left-leaning socialists (the ruiling party adheres to the swedish model aswell, however they have some kind of sense of realism), since that will cause investors and markets to lose faith in Swedens ability to continue driving a market based economy, which we have done very successfully for the last 8 years.",0,1410428425,null,0,1410428615,0,ckf7ag1,t3_2g2a88,t1_ckf7ag1,t1_ckf69vv,null,1427075685,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Each year, the Swedish Parliament provides funding to enable the Swedish Migration Board to transfer between 1,700 and 1,900 persons within the refugee quota. Today 27 countries accept quota refugees on an annual basis. [Source](http://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Protection-and-asylum-in-Sweden/The-refugee-quota.html)

Another thing that when I searched a little bit more information from the net, Sweden got 54270 refugee applications in 2013 compared to 3210 of Finland or 7170 of Denmark. Compared to population, Sweden should be receiving from around 6500 to 14000 refugee applications a year.  [Source](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics)

Oh, come on. First of all, even these schools have to adhere to state curricula in order for their students to receive diplomas such as the Abitur. You can't get an Abitur from a Waldorfschule by being good at knitting. However, Waldorfschulen feature a ""holistic"" approach to education, because their proponents believe a student will benefit from activities outside of memorizing data. This means that these activities happen *in addition* to the regular curriculum. At a typical Waldorfschule, a student will have to pick something ""extracurricular"", and will get to pick between woodworking, knitting, tailoring, acting etc.. At many schools, this is embedded into a bigger structure - at the Waldorfschule in this town, all of these activities lead up to a big play that is staged at the end of the year. The people doing woodworking build the sets, the tailors make the costumes etc. From my anecdotal experience during university, these students are much better at planning and following through on a project than those who went to a ""Regelschule"" (though, of course, there are other factors at work here, such as the student/teacher ratio which is lower in Waldorfschulen).

Second, as stupid as I personally think eurythmics is (especially as a 'forced' subject in school - and, by the way, most of the students hate it too!), it's about expressing yourself (i.e. words and feelings) through dance, and not spelling your name by means of dance. ""Posing"" letters is a method that is sometimes used to help children with an educational disability (or just kids that are lagging behind a little) to learn the alphabet. Some jokester/idiot conflated the two at one point, and now everyone repeats the anecdote of Waldorfschüler ""dancing their names."" 

Sorry for the rant - I neither went to a Waldorfschule, nor do I work there. I just hate seing dumb stereotypes being passed on as ""fact.""",0,1410428982,null,0,1410429193,0,ckf7dv9,t3_2g35ho,t1_ckf7dv9,t1_ckf71fs,null,1427075640,16,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,16

Why would they when the returns on newly built condominiums and luxury rentals is significantly higher? That's just good business acumen.

The Swedish Business Community and the Government need to find a workable medium within the current immigration levels. How many unskilled labor positions are available? How much investment is a business willing to undertake upskilling recent asylum seekers and immigrants in general? What are the employment prospects in regards to future automation? As it stands now, the general business community has a strong hiring bias towards people who have ""two ss"" in their last name (Meaning: Native Swedes, ex., Johansson, Ihaveajobsson, Swedesson). 

Currently, recent arrivals without means are segregated to certain areas, made to jump through the proverbial hoops (a never ending cycle of Arbetsförmedlingen, SFI, Lernia and Komvux) that have little inroads outside of government support.

And so does other religions.

Islam is not a giant monolithic entity. It comprises of 1.7 Billion followers from Shias to Sunnis and within those two you have Shias like Ismailis &amp; Zaidis and Sunnis like Shafie' &amp; Wahhabis.

It's similar to Christianity and Buddhism which has various forms of denominations. 

Sure, Islam is the problem, but is it all Muslims or certain sects like Salafis and Wahhabis? Should Ismailis be responsible for the actions of a Wahhabi?

true,GigaNigga720,AUST,Australia,"I think this is promising for renewables, wind should be utilized as much as possible and areas in the Mediterranean should undergo massive solar projects.

I think that solar power and improved battery storage (perhaps Teslas Gigafactory will make large storage battery prices plummet?) could easily see Spain, Portugal, Italy, The Balkans, Greece and Turkey sorted out nicely in terms of household energy.


I would also like to see power storage on a massive scale like molten salt so that renewables can be made more reliable. Unfortunately Spain was doing awesomely with building facilities such as this when they built this awesome wind turbine that heated up molten salts during the day with spare energy and then used the hot salt heat (~500C) to make steam at night providing 24 hours of energy for free.


CSP - thermal solar could be used in Morocco and parts of the middle east to focus the intense heat of the sun using mirrors onto a pipe containing molten salt which would produce a massive amount of energy at a loss of around 3% per 1000km (I think). North African CSP could easily sort out quite a lot of Europes energy demands and would eventually pay for itself and would still be viable in the winter and night time especially if storage solutions for energy (like molten salt) are implemented.


I guess the main problem with Europe is winter and heating houses in the winter. Gas from Putin isn't worth is because it gives him money and makes dealing with his imperialism harder than it needs to be, solar sucks in winter especially in cooler climates and wind can be sporadic.


I think that Thorium reactors would be awesome for Europe because of the massive availability of thorium, the safety of the reactors and the large amount of energy they produce. Of course Europe is gripped by Nuclear phobia and I guess I kind of am too but Thorium reactors don't need to be pressurized and for a whole lot of other reasons that I can't be bothered summarizing they are much safer.


There are two separate outfits currently at the moment one in Europe and one in the US researching nuclear fusion (fission is in nuclear reactors - fusion is what happens in the sun). It's hypothesised that fusion could inexpensively service the worlds energy needs and then some and we're currently researching it :)

Lourdes is one of the most alienating places on earth: somewhen and somehow the Holy Mary appeared to young shepherdess living there, so they built a huge sanctuary on it where you can go and pray and wash your self in its holy waters hoping that a miracle will free you from an illness.  
The sanctuary is the closest thing to a catholic disneyland: huge, massively crowded, there are the towers with spires, costume characters (well, nuns and priests from many different orders) and the daily and night parades. 
The city surrounding it is more like an agglomeration of cheap catholic themed hotel ad the crappiest and most blasphemous merchandise shops: you can get glow-in-the-dark biblical figures, Holy Mary shaped containers so you can bring the magical waters with you (some can carry ridiculously high quantity of it), holographic jesus, musical jesus, flickering led jesus, happy handsome jesus, dead suffering jesus etc.  
the people in lourdes is the most interesting bit, you get a very huge and different portrayal of humanity: people of many nationalities dying from many different terminal illness,  clergymen, loud and obnoxious groups, lone and perplexed tourists, children, old people, the pious and hardworking volunteer that patiently carries the sick people around and the greedy woman who's blind to all the real pain that surrounds her and only cares about filling bottles with shitload of magical water so she can be relieved for her nonexistent problems.

- un gouvernement corrompu a été défait par un mouvement populaire, lequel a réélu un gouvernement (qui est donc légitime).

The English identity has been a quiet identity for years.

Also, for generations the English have been under-represented in Parliament in comparison to their population size.

Geez, this argument. Yes, everyone commited attrocities in the past. However, we don't live in the past.

&gt;  You're telling me Islam is 'backwards and bloodthirsty', when it's pretty fucking clear it's not. All because of different cultural norms, which many change as they've integrated into European culture. But no! Their religion somehow makes them violent barbarians that must be expelled from Europa!

You must be blind. The rapes, honor killings, sharia police, sharia zones, anti-semitism. Threatening people and killing for drawing a cartoon - what other religion does that. Many comedians don't dare make jokes about Islam because they fear for their life, and rightfully so.

&gt;  The American Evangelicals preach hatred and intolerance, and have caused LGBT rights in Africa to be thrown backwards even worse than it is today. And you're telling me Islam is the 'most backwards'?

Yes, because this is a small minority of people doing this. Homosexuality is punishable in majority of Islam countries, in some even by death.

&gt;  You're using excuses and strawmen to justify your hatred of a religion because you don't agree with them at all. Just because of extremist violent Jihadists, who are condemned by many Imams across the world.

You say Islam is a religion. I say it's an ideology that is also a guide to all parts of the persons life. I don't see ideologies as sacred and immune to criticsm simply because people call them religion. Theres plenty of radical immans as well. A lot of people in the western world that become terrorists are swayed by their immans. That is a fact.

&gt;  And because of the few who cause all this grief, you condemn an entire religion. That's fucking bigoted and backwards thinking. Get the fuck out of this subreddit. We don't need people preaching horseshit like this.

It's definitely not a few. Stop being delirious. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html

I dislike Islam as a whole. Not just because of the terrorists. Read this and you'll understand.

Show me hard concrete proof of this.

&gt;I dislike Islam as a whole. Not just because of the terrorists. Read this and you'll understand. 

All I'm seeing is a religion who's grouping agrees on a core tenant, but then divides by what they believe in. I do not see how this affects the conversation beyond the fact this is just different in what they do.

&gt;It's definitely not a few. Stop being delirious. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.htm[1] 

Oh look, clickbait from a tabloid journalism. Not to mention the same site that'll spin as much bullshit as they want, and people take it as fact. Give me an actual concrete proof that isn't sensationalist bullshit.

And even then, this is a group of idiots who think they can police others. And time after time they've been arrested or stopped the practice. Unless suddenly they're popping up in every major city and they do nothing about it, this is just going to prove you're using minor incidents for confirmation bias.

&gt;You must be blind. The rapes, honor killings, sharia police, sharia zones, anti-semitism. Threatening people and killing for drawing a cartoon - what other religion does that. Many comedians don't dare make jokes about Islam because they fear for their life, and rightfully so.

Oh no, anti-semitism that's also being compounded by bigots over Israel is happening as well! And the fact the honour killings and rapes show there's a lack of screening. And first-gen who are either refusing to integrate or are completely denying any other culture than their own. Yes, those need to be dealt with, but being a bigoted shit won't resolve anything.

And the Sharia Police/Zones? Those have been smacked down repeatedly. Unless they somehow become permanent, which I highly doubt they will, they're minor problems by zealots. Unless they get physically violent, the police will do what they do and break them up time and time again.

&gt;Yes, because this is a small minority of people doing this. Homosexuality is punishable in majority of Islam countries, in some even by death.

['Small minority of people doing this'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory#mediaviewer/File:World_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg). Wow look at all these African countries that have outlawed LGBT rights that aren't directly Muslim! Totally a small minority doing it!

&gt;And this is another tactic muslims use. Silencing people. I wonder are you a muslim? And I will stay here as long as I please. Thanks.

No, I'm in fact not a Muslim. I'm here to smack down bigots and racists as they crop up in this subreddit. And you're a bigot who's refused to see Islam in another light beyond the vocal minority of extremists.

Sprich, sobald ein neues iPhone rauskommt, ist das alte ""veraltet"". Die Kritik richtet sich nicht in erster Linie, und schon gar nicht ausschließlich, gegen Leute, die sich was kaufen -- sondern gegen Marketing-Fuzzis, die Bedürfnisse erzeugen und schüren, wo vorher keine Waren, und den Leuten damit erfolgreich verführen, sowohl Zeit als auch Geld für etwas aufzuwenden, dass den Marketingfuzzis mehr bringt als den Käufern. Wie soll man diesen Missstand bekämpfen, ohne je a.) konkrete Beispiele zu nennen und b.) Leuten auf den Schlips zu treten?

Wenn ich Scientology kritisiere, könnte man auch sagen, lass' doch die Leute in Ruhe, wenn es ihnen was bringt, sollen sie sich doch für Seminare und sowas verschulden... ? Der MÜNDIGE Bürger kann machen, was er will. Was hier in meinen Augen zur Debatte steht, ist eben diese Mündigkeit, bzw. das bewußte Untergraben von rationalen Entscheidungen.

Wenn jemand eine Katze mit Katzenminze auf eine Strasse lockt und sie überfahren wird, war das dann ihre Entscheidung? Wenn der ""Verführer"" sowohl um die Wirkung von Katzenminze auf Katzen weiss, als auch um die Wirkung von Autos auf Katzen, kann der dann so tun, als wäre da nichts beabsichtigt? Ist die Katze etwa selber schuld, weil sie eine Katze ist? Haben Leute es ""verdient"", durch Werbung geistig entstellt zu werden, weil sie zu wenig hinterfragen? Wieviel Intelligenz und Abwesenheit von Druck und Leiden braucht der Mensch, um hinterfragen zu *können*? Steht das *allen* zur Verfügung? Wie steht es mit denen, die Werbestrategien entwerfen? Sind die auch alle gehetzt und ungebildet, oder werden die einfach nur ihrer Verantwortung nicht gerecht? Ist das vielleicht teilweise auch, weil sie eine Agenda verfolgen, die auf diese Verantwortung ausdrücklich und seid Jahrzehnten pfeift, und sie mit Propaganda und juristischen Mitteln abzudrängen und auszuhebeln versucht?

Ich finde, dass es noch lange nicht genug an Werbung und Werbungshörigkeit kritisiert wird. Nicht nur wegen Produkten, diese Methoden finden ja auch für politische Zwecke Anwendung. Nur darf man dann halt nicht glauben, nur weil X Dreck am Stecken hat, wäre Konkurrent Y dadurch aufgewertet, oder man selbst, weil man X nicht kauft oder wählt. Sicherlich ist viel ""bashing"" auch dadurch motiviert, aber was soll man machen.

Cherrypicking as always. There's no proof I can give you that would convince you. 

&gt;  Oh no, anti-semitism that's also being compounded by bigots over Israel is happening as well! And the fact the honour killings and rapes show there's a lack of screening. And first-gen who are either refusing to integrate or are completely denying any other culture than their own. Yes, those need to be dealt with, but being a bigoted shit won't resolve anything.

As I said, Islam is a danger.

&gt; And the Sharia Police/Zones? Those have been smacked down repeatedly. Unless they somehow become permanent, which I highly doubt they will, they're minor problems by zealots. Unless they get physically violent, the police will do what they do and break them up time and time again.

We are not arguing about police here. And well, if YOU doubt they won't be a permanent problem then it's all okay. Minor problems? No they're not. And the more muslims there will be in Europe the more of these ""minor"" problems we'll be facing.

&gt;  Wow look at all these African countries that have outlawed LGBT rights that aren't directly Muslim! Totally a small minority doing it!

Not directly muslim? So indirectly they are? Yes, subsaharan Africa is in many cases even more backwards than the muslim world. Congrats.

&gt; No, I'm in fact not a Muslim. I'm here to smack down bigots and racists as they crop up in this subreddit. And you're a bigot who's refused to see Islam in another light beyond the vocal minority of extremists. And there's easily ways to fight it, but nope, nobody wants to touch it.

Haha, you're actually helping without knowing it. Keep calling people who fear Islam bigots and racists. I know muslims who are ""liberal"" What I'm saying is that the word Islamphobia is ludicrous because the fear is very rational. Get this inside your head, please. Even if the minority consists of 15% of the muslims Islam is still a real danger. Also considering the fact that many of them are radicalizing in Europe.

If you are swedish you have all the social advantages not possible for many darker persons. You will have a easier time to find a apartment in a white area as long as you have a job.

&gt; I do, but not for the ""Alliance"" traitors who're more marxist than the marxists on social issues like crime.

No they are not marxist, that is just typical far right name-calling. Crime prevention is scientifically proven to be more effectively treated by just that, treatment instead of punishment. If you think that locking people up like they do in the USA just because they stole a candy bar, you are wrong. Just google it and you will find countless studies saying just that. 

&gt; Because the non-socialists have been so keen to cut immigrant welfare and immigration board funds. M and MP even pushed through changes to allow illegals to partake in the healthcare and school system.

There are no ""non-socialist"" parliamentary parties in Sweden, what do you mean? Even the far right is socalist. They even say so themselves (hint: they want to return to the old definition of ""folkhemmet"").

Lower taxes, lower subsidies is the only possible cure available. You might just get that by voting for the conservatives. As long as MP are the only option for governing together with the alliance, we will have the same immigrant politics. A vote for the left will result in the same, except more subsidies and higher taxes, further exuberating the problem.

A vote for the far right will result in nothing, because they will never be given mandate. We'll see a cross-block government before the far right is allowed power.

Non ci fu un referendum per l'adesione al regno d'Italia in quanto la repubblica di Genova era gia' sparita come stato indipendente alla fine del '700, a seguito della conquista di Napoleone. Successivamente al congresso di Vienna del 1815 il territorio fu assegnato al regno dei Savoia (ducato di Savoia/regno di Sardegna).

I referendum tenuti nel 1860-61 erano sostanzialmente dei voti a favore all'annessione al regno dei Savoia, che cambio' nome in Regno d'Italia. Poiche' la Liguria ne faceva gia' parte (volente o nolente) il referendum non era necessario.

Il ""sacco di Genova"" (aprile 1849) poi non c'entra assolutamente nulla con il regno d'Italia (che sarebbe nato 13 anni dopo). Fu uno degli strascichi dei moti del 1848 che scossero tutta l'europa, e fece seguito alla completa sconfitta dei Savoia da parte degli austriaci nella prima guerra di indipendenza. (Non voglio togliere nulla alla gravita' della repressione, solo evidenziare che di per se fu un episodio completamente slegato dalla successiva creazione del regno d'Italia).

even temp jobs? I get the reasoning for permanent employment but give them a chance.

I'm not afraid of of non-white on white crime. I fear isolationism, i fear avoidance racism. I fear that after years of neglect you can only enter those comuniities with armored trucks and neglect ruined a generation.

true,lordsleepyhead,NETH,In varietate concordia,"Somewhere during the 18th century the British lost interest in the Dutch. During the 17th century there was an epic rivalry going on for control of global trade, and the Brits won. During this rivalry a lot of hatred and negative stereotyping existed on both sides. After the Brits won, they quickly forgot about the Netherlands and reoriented towards the Americas and the British Empire. They never really stopped to check back to see how the Dutch were doing so the old-timey stereotypes didn't get re-evaluated and just sort of lingered in the subconscious cultural psyche.

Meanwhile, the Dutch had experienced a traumatic rags-to-riches-to-rags two centuries and needed to thoroughly rethink its cultural sense of self. This resulted in a sort of solemn introspection, almost navel-gazing, and retreating from the international scene for a century or so. When the Dutch re-emerged and started to participate internationally again, they looked to their closest kin to emulate: a lot of mid-20th-century Dutch culture is mimicry of British culture.

The Dutch, being geographically located between international heavyweights, has been forced to reconcile its own self-image with the pressures of globalization. The Brits, on the other hand, had been so culturally dominant up until the mid-20th-century that they hadn't developed the mental tools to reorient themselves in the global order yet.

The current self-deprecating acceptance of utter mediocrity that is so prevalent in the British sense of self today, is exactly like the sense of mediocrity the Dutch experienced during the 19th century (then called the ""Jan-Salie-mentality"", after a short story by Everhardus Johannes Potgieter about the slow, feckless mentality of the Dutch during the Industrial Revolution)",0,1410434156,null,0,false,0,ckf8c97,t3_2g2m74,t1_ckf8c97,t1_ckf82by,null,1427075195,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

Notably Sweden, in 2005, making the laws much broader. This *will* lead to an increase in rape reports based on the law. *However*, it also inflates the cases from 2004 - 2013 in the report by the fact the Swedish police investigate each independent case.

In proportionate systems where there are few seats (like Scotland in the EP, which are somewhat unusual in electoral terms) the smaller parties always end up not getting seats (as happened in Scotland with the Greens and the Lib Dems) and the larger parties therefore end up getting over-represented (as happened in Scotland with SNP, Labour, Conservatives and UKIP).

Ich mag Gysi. Er spricht sicherlich sehr oft an, was stimmt. Leider zum Teil sehr populistisch. In der Linken gibt es leider Leute, die ""etwas"" extremer sind. Das ist aber die Minderheit. Von den Positionen her ist die Linke nicht extremer als die SPD vor Schröder und dem Ruck nach rechts. 

Aber: Hier geht doch so viel kaputt. Infrastruktur, sowohl Schiene als auch Autobahn, da wird viel zuwenig investiert. Das ist auch schlecht für die Wirtschaft. Bei der Bildung wird gespart: ich rede nicht von einzelnen Lehrergehältern, aber insgesamt braucht es auch da mehr Investitionen, und sei es nur eine Mensa pro Schule, damit die Kinder was warmes zu essen haben. Bei vielen ist das heutzutage ja leider das einzige warme Essen am Tag. Es kann auch nicht angehen, dass eine zweistellige Prozentzahl an Menschen von Armut betroffen oder gefährdet ist, während ""die da oben"" immer reicher werden und völlig den Kontakt zu der großen Masse Menschen verlieren, auf denen ihr Reichtum aufbaut.

Dann der größte Niedriglohnsektor in Europa. Was soll das? Um des Exports willen wird die Binnennachfrage geopfert. Toll. Mieten kann sich kaum mehr einer leisten in den Großstädten. Die Antwort war eine halbherzige Mietpreisbremse. Hier geht es nichtmal um sinnvolle Investitionen: hier soll einfach nur abgezockt werden, in die Häuser selbst wird nichts investiert, die gehen langsam kaputt. Sozialer Wohnungsbau ist nicht, dabei ist es ein probates Mittel gegen ""Ghettoisierung"" ganzer Viertel und sorgt für bessere Durchmischung von Stadtteilen.

Und das ist auch keine Frage von links oder rechts, das ist nur noch eine Frage davon, wie man 'ne soziale Katastrophe abwenden kann. Und die Gefahr kommt nicht von den EU-Ausländern, die hier arbeiten wollen, sondern von den Reichen, die hier nicht mehr Steuern zahlen wollen. Die *denken* ja auch noch, sie müssten sich nicht an bestehende Gesetze halten und schippern ihr Geld gemütlich in die Schweiz.

Gegen die Industriespionage seitens der Amis wird auch nichts getan: Spätestens hier muss doch wirklich auch den Konservativen die Hutschnur hochgehen?!

You really are functionally illiterate? Damn. 

ELI2: Organisation can call itself whatever it wants. It doesnt mean it actually is what its name implies. I gave you an obvious example in form of North Korea which is called DPRK - **Democratic** People's Republic of Korea. 

&gt;This is the attitude dictators and autocrats have. A government should conform to the EUs standards. If they want to be part of the biggest economic block (that consistently promotes human rights and democracy through the use NGOs) then this should be handled more delicately. definitely NOT with continued raids on NGOs that are widely known to promote democracy and civil liberties throughout Europe. Especially when their main demographic is less developed countries such as Hungary.

This is **foreign** organisations trying to manipulate government composition by financing those that benefit foreign organisations. Even at expense of native population. Just because NGO claims is for democracy it doesnt mean its for democracy. And an **elected** government of **sovereign** country has every right to demand whatever they want from foreign organisations trying to operate in its territory. The very moment the government stops calling shots on whats going on in its country is the moment that country is no longer free and subject to foreign power/influence.

&gt;If you want to live in a country that oppresses civil liberties, democracy and transparency thats fine, but you have to leave the EU first.

However I don't think it will work that way. The robots need to be built somewhere, factories wich become targets for an opposing robot army. Unless the factory is run by robots and supervised by robots then people will get hurt there.

Can these robots be 100% autonomous? How will they know if a peace treaty is signed? How will they get new orders? Are they capable of forming their own strategies? I think people will need to be behind the controls, in at least as much of a control as in an RTS. These people will become targets.

We must also look at what the robots are fighting for. Why did we give them the task to capture this city? The reason is usually because there are military assets which need to be captured, there could be important resources or the people in control of the opposing robots are there. Any of these could be the reason to invade a populated city. Do you not think there's going to be any casualties in this invasion? That all the civlians are going to just walk around the battle? Sometimes the civilians themselves can be a target if they want tgo rid the area of a troublesome population.

true,LimitlessLTD,EURO,Brtish/European Citizen,"&gt; And yet another simplistic comment gets to the top. NATO has been very agressive towards Russia since the fall of the USSR

Can you give some examples of how NATO has been aggressive towards Russia?

&gt; Admitadly, the Russians are very paranoid and the the thought that Ukraine could somehow join NATO after the Maidan protest triggered the (exageratted) response.

This is one of the biggest problems in Russia i believe, conspiracy theories run rampant [\(this is one example\)](http://www.thewire.com/global/2013/02/russian-meteorite-conspiracy-theories-debunked/62203/) and most people believe in ""different versions of the truth"". A number of RT journalists have resigned due this exact reason.

&gt; NATO has been trying to justify its existence by going into pointless conflicts like Libya,

Libya was not a conflict though, NATO used air strikes and naval bombardments to weaken Gadaffi's forces, and the Libyan rebels simply over ran the remaining defences of the Gadaffi regime.

NATO was also mandated by the UN (China and Russia abstained, they didnt make that mistake on Syria however) to impose a no-fly zone, which admittedly NATO took to mean destroy all ground and air defences/capabilities.

HOWEVER, NATO is needed, and it heavily contributes to the continued stability of central Europe. See the hundreds of years of war between each other before WW2 and the formation of NATO. Europe is finally (mostly) united.

In a world where nuclear weapons and rogue states exist, NATO is not only wanted but it is needed. For the protection of small European states and for its uniting properties. Although it was originally intended to be a purely European Alliance which i would be happy to revert too, but Europe is not strong enough yet (politically and militarily).

&gt; but this was jackpot, they can rally other european countries to counter the russian response, thus justifying the need to have a ""NATO"".

IIRC high level US officials said they did not want Ukraine to join NATO when Yanukovich was in power due to their Russias percieved ""sphere of influence"". I cant find the source for this though atm.

&gt; Also, there was external involvement in the Maidan Protests which can not be ignored.

If you are referring to the involvement of US officials (was it john kerry) i agree that it was a step too far. But after the violent suppression of protesters by government forces, it can clearly be put into perspective. Also only 10 years earlier was their a similar revolution in which Yanukovich was accused of massive corruption and voter fraud. There was a re-vote, and Yanukovich lost. That should be quite indicative of what sort of person Yanukovich is.

If you are referring to NGOs the EU funds, you should know those NGOs exist in many countries inside the EU and on Europe's peripheries. They are purely for the promotion of human rights, democracy and civil liberties. I would prefer not to get into conspiracy theories about how the NGOs are covers for paramilitary organisations or are controlled by the Jews though.",0,1410436281,null,0,false,0,ckf8tio,t3_2g1k8r,t1_ckf8tio,t1_ckf8g80,null,1427074970,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The Hungarian government agreed with this but now is going against it, unilaterally.

Their stated reasons for doing so keep changing too. First they claimed that the Okotars Foundation was tied to the political party LMP. But they couldn't find any evidence for that. Then the government claimed that  it had evidence of inappropriate financial dealings, but all they ended up being able to show were minor administrative problems.

The difference is then the *direction* of that expansionism. Perhaps because of the containment on an island, the British expanded via colonialism.

The mantra was that the south (Rome included) was “stealing” money by means of taxes without giving back enough. How this could have worked was never really fleshed out, and it remained pure speculation. The fact that people stopped believing it was feasible and the necessity to form alliances with more moderate parties led to them dropping the topic.

&gt;There are no ""non-socialist"" parliamentary parties in Sweden, what do you mean? 

There are several. Welfare statism is an arch-conservative response to the socialists, whom our Moderates are bowing to in every question but economics (where they make a huge multi-billion dollar exception for immigration, even suggesting higher taxes over it), courtesy of Bismarck.

&gt;Lower taxes, lower subsidies is the only possible cure available. 

What a load of shit. The Moderates have deliberately taken in more and more and now you think people will fall for the people causing the problem giving their ""solution"" to it as well?

You should be happy if they even manage a minority government 8+ years from now.

Which ones are you referring to?

Because literally the only party to hold any conservative opinions whatsoever are SD and some of the youth section of KD.

We'll have them as long as SD isn't in a position to tip the scales regardless of the smaller parties, as has been made painfully clear by the posturing of Reinfeldt and his lot.

Whereas the massively higher intake of the Moderates haven't. At least a fringe of the Leftards are considering cutting some of the immigration, even if they're being their usual self-righteous hypocritical selves about it.

Some have a once-off meaning and some are ""sticky"".  Etc.  There's a whole stack of information you constantly have to process.

Essentially, at any given time you should know exactly what you're supposed to be doing, and where you're supposed to be.  In most other countries, there's some leeway.

I find that German drivers make very little eye contact.  If you follow the rules exactly (and everyone else does as well) there's very little reason to look at your fellow drivers.  Most other places, there are often instances where it's somewhat ambiguous what the ""right"" thing to do would be, and this very often requires some eye contact and an implicit agreement between drivers as to who's doing what.",0,1410437692,null,0,false,0,ckf96gs,t3_2g0u6r,t1_ckf96gs,t1_ckexs9h,null,1427074803,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

Oh, that's true of course. If the government feels so strongly that those pesky freedom-of-expression and human rights groups shouldn't receive any grants from abroad, it is presumably free to tell Norway c.s. that it no longer wants their funding anymore. Of course this would also mean foregoing on the (much larger) parts of said funding which are going to less bothersome projects, which the government had been all too happy to receive ...

Simplifying it, this is in essence a form of development aid. National governments don't usually get a line item veto on the development aid programs it accepts from abroad. If the Hungarian government is going to insist on wresting control of who exactly will receive the Norwegian funding (which, judging on the government's track record, would mean channeling it to friends of the government), Norway has already made clear it will stop providing the funding. Not just the bits of funding that go to organizations like the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, but also the funding that the government was all too happy to accept for broader projects. 

That's not what Orban's government wants though. They want Norway to keep sending its money, but themselves get to say what it is spent on. That's not how it works though. It's Norway's money, not Orban's.

&gt;They didnt relinquish their sovereignty.

You seem fundamentally misguided about the nature of the EU. *Of course* it relinquished part of its sovereignty. And it is now tied to the legal agreements it entered with the EU and in the framework of the EU.

Plus the mafia started infiltrating the north and of course the politicians in Rome are corrupt (LN exploded during the Operation Clean Hand trials when several politicians were jailed for corruption). So people reacted by voting Lega.

But Padania doesn't exist, and never existed, it was just marketing. The Lega Nord also came up with bullshit about the Padania's ""celtic"" heritage, even though they originally come from Lombardy, and Lombardy = Longobards, a germanic tribe. They basically just made shit up. They even have their football team, who plays in the ""alternative"" ConIFA world cup against Quebec, Kurdistan, Isle of Man, Lapland, etc. It's all bullshit though. People feel tied in to their area, like ""Brianza"", ""Bassa Novarese"", etc, possibly a bit to their region, but to Padania... not really. 

There is however a stronger separatist feeling in Veneto (which was an actual independent country for 1000 years), but that doesn't necessarily translate itself into a political movement - it is fragmented in a  few small separatist parties, none of which is big enough to get into parliament (they don't seem smart enough to understand that a single separatist party in parliament would be better than 6 minuscole ones). The Venetians were part of the Padania movement, but they are striking out on their own now.

There cultural differences are actually that big.

And it's true that the south is basically a failed state (see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples_waste_management_issue ) , and the north subsidizes it. But the vast majority of people sees any point in splitting up.

Of course there are other exceptions, the Süd Tirolers, the Valdostains, the Sardinians, but they *are* actually ethnically distinct.

The massive expansion of NATO after the fall of the USSR and their attempts over the past to lure countries like Ukraine or Georgia to the alliance. That alone is not very agressive, but when you add the Missile defense system into the equation, it sounds a bit agressive.

&gt; This is one of the biggest problems in Russia i believe, conspiracy theories run rampant (this is one example)[1] and most people believe in ""different versions of the truth"". A number of RT journalists have resigned due this exact reason.

I agree

&gt; HOWEVER, NATO is needed, and it heavily contributes to the continued stability of central Europe. See the hundreds of years of war between each other before WW2 and the formation of NATO. Europe is finally (mostly) united.

I have to disagree with you on this. The main cause for peace and stability in central europe has been due to the EU, not NATO. During the cold war it was different story, but today the EU unites all the countries with economical, social and political integration.

&gt; IIRC high level US officials said they did not want Ukraine to join NATO when Yanukovich was in power due to their Russias percieved ""sphere of influence"". I cant find the source for this though atm.

Ukraine wanted to join but eventually Yanukovich changed his mind and went with a partnership instead. It's not surprising if those US officials said that, though.

&gt; If you are referring to the involvement of US officials...If you are referring to NGOs the EU funds...

The involvment of US officials, yeah i think it was John Kerry, showed and made the russians think (justifiably) that the americans were directly involved in the protests and that was seen as agression. 

About the NGOs and EU funds, i know what they do and what's their objective, but there can be no denying that they are used as political tools. The media doesn't help either (both sides).",0,1410438962,null,0,false,0,ckf9jlc,t3_2g1k8r,t1_ckf9jlc,t1_ckf8tio,null,1427074634,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Social Justice Warrior. A pejorative term for an individual who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation. A social justice warrior, or SJW, does not necessarily strongly believe all that they say, or even care about the groups they are fighting on behalf of. They typically repeat points from whoever is the most popular blogger or commenter of the moment, hoping that they will ""get SJ points"" and become popular in return. They are very sure to adopt stances that are ""correct"" in their social circle.



&gt;The SJW's favorite activity of all is to dogpile. Their favorite websites to frequent are Livejournal and Tumblr. They do not have relevant favorite real-world places, because SJWs are primarily civil rights activists only online.


---

_#1:_



_A social justice warrior reads an essay about a form of internal misogyny where women and girls insult stereotypical feminine activities and characteristics in order to boost themselves over other women._



_The SJW absorbs this and later complains in response to a Huffington Post article about a 10-year-old feminist's letter, because the 10-year-old called the color pink ""prissy""._



_#2:_



_Commnter: ""I don't like getting manicures. It's too prissy.""_



_SJW: ""Oh my god, how fucking dare you use that word, you disgusting sexist piece of shit!""_

Frankly, I don't know (beside the fact that the local support to the lega nord or extreme right parties is a good indicator of the open mindness of a place). The main problem is that many immigrants are first generation, work on low wages job and have connections mainly with their communities, so there's still not much daily interaction between immigrants and middle class Italians. People are afraid of what they don't know so many Italians, when thinking of immigrants, think of the africans or southern asians trying to sell crap in the streets, or bank robbers they heard of on the news. Then a eastern european family moves next door, or a northern african artisan comes to fix stuff in their houses, or they hire a Polish lady to take care of their elders, and they can be extremely tolerant with them.   
My 80 years old uncle would tell you that ""Immigrants are bad"", and at the same time deeply respected the lady that took care of his mother and often shares a joyful banter with the moroccan guy living at the end of the street.  

It's easy to put every one that thinks like my uncle under the ""Racist"" umbrella, the truth is that he doesn't care about nationality, he's just generally scared because of the few encounters he had with foreigners, two included theft and assault. fifty years ago the ""dangerous social group"" would be the immigrants from the south and before that the local poors.

Back to the question, I think many immigrants living around me live a pretty decent life and aren't really hurt by the occasional rude asshole, then of course there's the black guy that rings on my bell every week asking for some coins, who's life is probably even shittier than I imagine.  
my cousin's sons are mixed race, their father was almost adopted by a local family when he came here and I don't really think that Italy is a bad place for them to be (definitely better than growing up in a ""ghetto"" in supposedly less racist countries).

Gysi argumentiert für präventive Friedensarbeit d.h. Konflikte lösen und langfristig verhindern bevor sie in Kriegshandlungen ausarten. Das kann man machen.

völlig Völkerrechtskonforum und _zumindest im Irak_ sind dann doch ein kleiner Widerspruch. Ich denke man kann einen Oppositionspolitiker zugestehen dies zu thematisieren ohne ihn zu verunglimpfen.

Unmoralisch... du sagst das so einfach.. als wenn die USA stehts die besten Interessen der Menschen auf der Welt im Sinn haben und im Irak und Afghanistan Krieg und Lybien nicht unzählige Menschen gestorben sind - entweder direkt als Kollateralschaden oder indirekt durch den Zusammenbruch der Staatsmacht und die darauffolgende Willkürherrschaft von kriminellen Clans und die Macht des stärkstens in der Gegend... 

&gt; Aber das hier widert mich einfach nur an.

Okay im Ernst... bin auch kein Gysi Fan, aber Syrien zu bombadierden ohne Einwilligung der Regierung ist eben nach völkerrechtlichen Gesichtspunkten _problematisch_. Darf man das noch sagen?

You know history didn't begin with WW1 right? I'm going to ignore the ""it was all evil Germany's fault"" thing because it's futile to argue about these things on the internet, but these conflicts didn't develop out of thin air. And since you talk about ""knowing your history"" you should probably know about France's role in Europe prior to WW1 which was exactly the origin of the way of thinking you are asking about. And frankly it's not hard to see why that developed and why it persisted.

Die Türken bilden schon einige Zeit zusammen mit den USA  **einige** [Einheiten/Bataillone](http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/1lk9m1/basic_guide_to_factions_in_the_syrian_civil_war/) der [Free Syrian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Syrian_Army) aus, und zwar genau nicht die typischen Dorftrottel die dann überlaufen, wenn der[ Sold](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/naher-osten/kaempfer-der-syrischen-opposition-vom-westen-verlassen-13140380.html) und die [Machtverhältnisse](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10485970/Syria-dispatch-from-band-of-brothers-to-princes-of-war.html) passen  - oder sie Angst vor einer neuen Lokalmacht haben und dann lieber gleich überlaufen, siehe Al Nusra-Überläufer zu ISIS. Finanzielle Hilfe kriegen deshalb mittlerweile zb auch nicht Dachorganisationen wie FSA oder National Coalition, sondern einzelne vertrauensürdige und vornehmlich moderat-säkulare Einheiten. Die Osama-Bin-Laden Brigade wäre dann zb vom Training und der Hilfe ausgeschlossen. Ist aber dann auch immer einer Frage der strategischen Wichtigkeit einer Region und deren agierenden Milizen.

Ansonsten gibts da noch zb Saudi-Arabien und Katar, die die Dschihadisten (Al Nusra et cetera) und moderatere (moderat muss bei Syrien immer im Kontext zum größeren Übel gelesen werden, is ja nicht da als gäbs dort so viele lupenreine Demokraten) bis radikale Islamisten (Islamic Front) unterstützen.

Da bereits die Al Nusra-Front von der Türkei als Terrororganisation gezählt wird (seit Juni, ist ja schließlich ein Teil der AlKaida), wird es dort kaum für ISIS Hilfe gegeben haben. Jedoch ließ die Türkei anfangs die ganzen Dschihadisten u.a. der Al Nusra durch die Türkei aus- und einwandern. Jedenfalls hat sich das mittlerweile auch mehr oder weniger gegeben.

Ich bin mir nicht ganz sicher warum, vielleicht hatten sie so große Angst vor der ISIS, dass sie die anderen Dschihadisten insofern unterstützen, dass die sich erstmal selber gegenseitig müde kämpfen. Schließlich war die Al Nusra zeitweise eine, bzw während dem Niedergang bis zu ihrem neuen comeback der moderaten FSA *die*, starke Lokalmacht. Außerdem gibt es ja auch mehrere kurdische Brigaden die in Syrien unterwegs sind, denke die sind der Türkei auch ein Dorn im Auge, denn da kamen schon manche [Beschwerden](http://www.todayszaman.com/news-322769-pyd-leader-turkey-continues-to-support-al-nusra-front-against-kurds.html) von Kurden. Dazu kommt die rechtliche und organisatorische Problematik wie man überhaupt jemand als Dschihadist identifizieren soll, und welcher Gruppe er überhaupt zugehört usw. Wie soll das gehen? Zumindest werden -wenn schon radikale Islamisten unterstützt werden- dann auch diejenigen unterstützt die die noch Radikaleren bekämpfen. So läuft das dort, auch wenns zwar nicht unsinnig, aber unnachhaltig und unvollständig klingt.

Ich denke eher, die Türkei weiß nicht so recht was sie machen soll und hat keinen Überblick. Schätze die wollen das aussitzen und erstmal noch nicht in diesen Splittergruppen verseuchten Sauladen eingreifen und versuchen deshalb einfach die moderate FSA zu unterstützen und gut is. Wenn die PKK wieder am nerven is dann spielt man der AlNusra was zu und was weiß Ich. Einfach gegenseitig aufreiben lassen, dann hat der Westen es leichter hinterher aufzuräumen, das scheint die Devise von einigen zuschauenden Staaten zu sein.

**tl,dr:** die Türkei unterstützen nicht die ISIS. Nach dem [tödlichsten Terrorakt auf türkischem Boden](http://istanbulian.blogspot.com/2013/05/deadliest-terror-attack-in-turkeys.html) durch ISIS im März 2013, liefert sich die türkeische Grenzarmee schon seit Januar/Februar Scharmützel mit ISIS und ISIS ist seit Juni auf der Terrorliste der Türkei.

**Edit:** Da das mit der Zersplitterung und den Verbindungen so kompliziert ist und ich die Aufnahme der AlNusra mit ISIS vertauscht habe: Die ISIS ist nicht unbedingt seit Juni auf der Terrorliste der Türkei, sondern die/eine Vorgängerorganisation [wohl schon seit 2005](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/26/us-iraq-security-turkey-idUSKBN0GQ0ZO20140826).

They tried negotiating with Google too, but Google was downright hostile and arrogant. No special Android customizations for Nokia or any other special treatment, which would have probably meant saying bye to Nokia Here (maps) and other Nokia services and using the Google equivalents instead.
 
There were also fears that Nokia Android phones would not have sold well since they would have then been just another Android shop. And, even if they sold well, they might not have been able to turn a profit, since nobody except for Samsung made any significant Android money.

That was of course not a good reason for going with Windows Phone, since then it was pretty much guaranteed that the phones would not sell. (Everyone following the situation realized it at the time and the stock took quite a dive after it was announced). But Microsoft offered their bribe (platform support) payments and lots of other sweet promises (Nokia being the preferred wp vendor, allowed to make their customizations), and that way they went.

Microsoft dragged their feet with the wp development and it never became good enough to sell well.

The big issues are funding, corporate interests and ideology - the technology and the know how are already there. Basically, funding needs to be secured and the reliance of some countries on their exports for energy don't want to hurt their economy to save the planet, corporate interests are too far intertwined with politics and it really shows with how many climate change deniers there are right now. Also, conservative and libertarian ideologies conflict with the notion of governments intervening in the energy industries despite the massive subsidies coal and oil receive every year.


In many countries solar can sort out most residential needs and in very sunny and equatorial/arid conditions CSP (thermal solar energy) can produce lots of energy reliably and very cheaply - storage is less of an issue with molten salts and battery research making small gains. Wind can produce massive amounts of energy and we should be investing in these much more than we are, onshore and offshore they're great because if they're built in a suitable environment once they've paid themselves off then it's free energy and it's good for the environment.


Other things that we can do is afforestation, planting a forests is a good idea because not only do they sequester lots of carbon from the atmosphere they clean the air, provide natural habitat for animals, provide timber which has a whole range of uses. We should also begin the process (many cities already have) of urban forestation which basically means planting trees in urban environments - Trees in and around cities can cause the temperature of the city to drop substantially and they also stop wind which stops dust, soil erosion and can be irritating. They also provide psychological benefits and they can clean the air and reduce smog, trees in neighborhoods and carparks also make the asphalt last longer because the sun and wind can't weaken it as much.


There are a few massive projects that could sequester large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere one of the bigger ones is greening deserts, the Sahara and the Australian Outback are two candidates because of their sheer size and because they are both close to sources of water, for low cost a seawater greenhouse can be set up in the desert using natural processes allowing for us to stop using up all the available rainwater so quickly and to stop overfarming fertile lands and let them return to natural carbon sequestering habitats.


Saudi Arabia is also experimenting and investing in CSP Desalination which uses the thermal energy of the sun to desalinate water and irrigate parts of the desert to make trees and plants grow. If we really set our minds to it massive swathes of the Sahara and Australian Outback where there was pretty much nothing before could sequester astronomical amounts of carbon from the atmosphere - the figures I saw were [8 billion tonnes per year](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2009/09/15/to-save-the-planet-from-global-warming-turn-the-sahara-green/#.VBGfEfmSzO8).

I got my permit to drive after taking a 20 question written test and not getting more than four questions wrong.  I was allowed to then drive with someone over 18 during daylight hours, and proceeded to put 150 miles on the car that day.  That was a Tuesday.

On Saturday I took the required five hour defensive driving class.  On Monday I signed up for my road test, and took it a couple of weeks later.  I had my permit all of three weeks and a day before I had my junior license at age 16.  

The NEXT summer I signed up for Driver's Education.  I took it already having had my license for ten months.  However, it allowed me to get my senior license, my full license, at age 17 rather than having to wait when it would automatically happen with no effort on my part at age 18.

Now granted, this was 21 years ago in New York State (all states are different, and New York is different now).  Luckily I DO happen to be a good driver, which is why this worked out and I passed my written and road tests.  But it could be that easy to get a license in the US.  Take a 20 question test (two years later when my brother did it it was five questions, but you could only get one wrong), take a five hour class, and off you go.  

When we got to Germany I commented that I'd love to get a German license.  It'd be a nice souvenir.  The lady helping us (the relocation specialist assigned to us) stared at me like I was crazy.  She said it was about €2000 and six months to a year to get a license in Germany (we were only going to be there six months).  When I moved from New York to North Carolina, and then from North Carolina to Washington, getting a new license took about an hour of waiting and filling out some forms.  But her saying that was my first clue that Germans (and most Europeans) take this driving stuff very very seriously.

On the other hand, the US is a LOT bigger, and we have an honest need for cars.  You can get a license in some states with a large rural population at age 14 with the idea being that you can then drive your family's farm equipment, or help out with the household a lot sooner.  Most of our country does not have any public transportation, cabs, or even safe sidewalks.  So when we say we're a nation of drivers, we really mean it.  We could not do without the car.

Lions used to dwell around Macedonia and the ancient historians have recorded this. The lion hunt was popular among the Macedonians and lion hunt scenes have found their place in the Macedonian art. The Macedonian kings also wore the lion's skin.

Whether we realise it or not, there's so much good to come from this union and for Europe to stick together because the adversities that might be coming our way require us to stay united as something we call ""Europe""

Europe has had a very turmoiled and difficult past in the past century and is home to many different cultures in a very small region, unlike places like China, Russia or America, which makes it more difficult for us to find agreements.

The problem is that if we don't, we'll suffer from too much internal strife to be able to defend ourselves.


So fuck this separation bullshit and try to work together.

There has been a bazillion thread about this subject on /r/askhistorians and every single time the common trope of Germany just defending itself, or not being more responsible than other parties is debunked; same for the relation between Versailles and nazism.

The part about the past is to explain why people were, understandably, in some way wary of German and Germany after WW2 and why Germany had to act the way it did for so many years, i.e., act like some kind of underdog and try not to make too much wave and appearing too much dominant in the european construction.

It also describes the ""insolubility"" of the Spanish nation without defining the latter. The Constitution of 1812 said something similar and then they lost the American colonies, so what is this Spanish nation?

But let's assume it says you cannot do it. That is still not the real problem. The problem is that the big parties don't want it. They simply use the Constitution as a shield. It can be changed with a majority, as they did when Merkel said so to include the payment of the debt. So it has nothing to do with the Constitution but with their ideals. It is easier to say that it is illegal than saying ""no, I don't want you to exercise an universal right that we signed"" or ""no because I don't recognise you as a nation"" (which is by all means ridiculous).",0,1410443048,null,0,false,0,ckfazcg,t3_2g2i0i,t1_ckfazcg,t1_ckf9erg,null,1427073961,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

true,TheAppleManSam,UNSA,Dirty South,"&gt;An independent Scotland would need to build up large currency stockpiles to successfully use the pound without a formal agreement with the rest of the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs on Wednesday.

&gt;While Mr Carney resolutely refused to give a calculation on the precise levels required, he told MPs on the Treasury select committee that the experience from other countries was that central banks needed to have reserves equivalent to at least 25 per cent of gross domestic product if they used another country’s currency.

&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Mr Carney also reiterated to MPs that the BoE had contingency plans in place for a Yes vote, adding it would *“obviously implement them if at all required in the short term.”*

&gt;He also stressed repeatedly that the BoE would remain the central bank and lender of last resort for the whole of the UK – including Scotland – during the expected 18 month transition period.

&gt;Asked about the risk of capital flight, Mr Carney said Scottish banks would have access to BoE facilities and Scottish depositors would have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

For example Standard Life even said it would move it's offices to London. That referendum was passed and guess what, economic apocalypse didn't occur and Standard Life is still here.

Obviously independence is a different kettle of fish. Maybe the threats are sincere this time. But maybe they are not. The Nationalists certainly want people to believe the latter.

In the short run we can reactivate coal plants, who are emitting a shitload of greenhouse gases and radiation. Another alternative is stopping or slowing down the nuclear exit plans which isn't great either.

In the medium and long term we need to find a balance between competitive energy prices, using available and in the best case local resources and cutting back emissions. Problem is that a regime change in such an complex system is facing a lot of obstacles and most likely opposition of very powerful players (e.g. utility companies that have to depreciate their investments and so on)

I am of opinion (and I am not really an expert even though I have a little experience in this matters) that investing in alternative energy can create a lot of value edit for the region its produced in. So a big political push like the one Putin is giving us now may provide the chance of tackling the greening of our energy systems while at the same time it may boost the job market especially for low qualified people that are struggling at the moment.

&gt;___The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice___ is an essay by the British-American journalist and polemicist [Christopher Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) published in 1995. It criticizes the work and philosophy of [Mother Teresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa), the founder of a Roman Catholic [religious congregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_(Catholic\)) that provides charitable services worldwide, and the mainstream media's assessment of her charitable efforts. In length more a pamphlet than a book,  it was re-issued in paperback and ebook form with a foreword by [Thomas Mallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mallon) in 2012.

Now, I agree that the Leaning Tower by itself is not worth a visit to Pisa, but you're being too dismissive here. The cathedral is impressive, a unique blend of finely-detailed decoration and plain angular facades, and when it's not full of tourists (in the early morning and evening, when you also have the best sunlight) Campo dei Miracoli (the green field where the Tower is located) is an exceptionally serene and beautiful place, with its bright green short-cut grass field hosting these striking towering white marble structures.

You are also forgetting to mention the [Baptistry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_Baptistry) and its marvelously detailed carved exterior, again all in white marble, mirrored and contrasted by it's simple geometric interior.

They were denied the currency union, they were also denied joining the EU and have been told they have to go through the membership program. The thing about the membership program is that they need a central bank, one which they do not have.

Since they have no central bank, launching a new currency will also be hard. Now to add to that, Alex S. has said repeatedly that he will not pay his share of the UK debts.

So Scotland will be without a currency, will be without a banking institution, and will not be paying their debts. When you don't pay your debts, banks and nations will not lend you capital.

The big plan was that Westminister will totally concede and will give them everything they want. That didn't happen and as a result, going through with their campaign as if it did will completely fuck their nation dry economically.

But of course Russia won't, because Russia isn't like the West. A good thing from a certain point of view, but a bad thing in other situations. Russia is very protective of its own 'backyard', hence the current conflict. I repeat it because I honestly believe that international law - fuzzy as it might be - needs to be respected. And YES, the US has violated international law on quite a few occassions, but I don't look to the US to make my own judgement.

Judging from the viewpoint of European nations, that have more of a clean slate in these matters, measures against Russia are justified. If Russia uses gas as a weapon - and thereby decides to utterly destroy its own economy - then so be it. The Ruble has already dropped significantly, and a deep recession is looming in Russia. Let Putin and his comrades feel the pain that comes with acting like a global warmonger.  Apparantly one warmonger - the United States of America - wasn't enough in that regard.

wow, that's impressive knowledge of N. Korea you have. Can i ask, how did you come to realise DPRK isnt democratic? Did you read it in the news, from a media outlet you trust i pressume? Do you see what im getting at here? If not ill explain, because you dont seem too bright i might have to go into some detail.

&gt; This is foreign organisations trying to manipulate government composition by financing those that benefit foreign organisations. Even

WRONG, this is foreign organisations promoting civil liberties and democracy even if its to the detriment of the west.

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa) is an incredibly informative article for you to educate yourself with. I know you like to assume everyone outside your country is out to get you, especially those  Norwegians, they are the centre of evil after all.

Let me quote some passages from that article for you, because im sure you wont read it. You would rather stay vapid and un-educated.

&gt; The usually fractious oppositions have to be united behind a single candidate if there is to be any chance of unseating the regime. That leader is selected on pragmatic and objective grounds, **even if he or she is anti-American.**

These NGOs are purely for the promotion of civil liberties and democracy, regardless of what you or your government says. The proof is easy to see when you look at other former communist countries that are now upholding and actively promoting freedom of speech, democracy and transparency.

&gt; And as i said before. NGOs can say whatever they want, but its what they do that matters.

Funny how the NGOs have proven themselves time and again to be bastions of civil liberties irrespective of their backers, but you blindly parrot Russia and other authoritarian, un-democratic regimes.

&gt; Hungary apparently ordered access to documentation of those NGOs which implies that they were not transparent.

Hungary wanted the NGOs fundings sent to the government first. They said the government would distribute the funds to the NGOs as they saw fit. The NGOs refused because of the Hungarian governments known corruption problems and links with Russia. Hungary got buttmad and is now actively repressing democratic and civil liberty activism.

Ich bin kein Historiker und habe mich auch nicht intensiv mit dem Dritten Reich beschäftigt, trotzdem will ich dir antworten, wenn der eine oder andere Fehler dabei ist, wird den hoffentlich jemand finden und korrigieren.
Vorneweg, die meisten deiner Pro-Argumente sind Mythen über die angeblich guten Seiten des Dritten Reiches. Bei genauere Betrachtung lösen sich die meisten davon in Luft auf:

&gt; Autobahn(natürlich),

Der Standardmythos. Nein Hitler hat die Autobahn nicht erfunden, die Pläne gab es schon vorher, die erste Autobahn wurde 1932 von einem gewissen Konrad Adenauer eingeweiht. Die Autobahn hättes also ohne Hitler auch gegeben, vielleicht erst ein wenig später. (Auch Länder ohne Nazis haben heute Autobahnen.)
&gt; Gebietsgewinne in Richtung Tschechien,

Ja, das kann man positiv sehen, andererseits, war das so toll? Deutschland war ohnehin sehr groß und auf die reine Fläche kommt es ja nicht an. Die besten Zeiten hatten wir in der BRD, als Deutschland so richtig klein war.
&gt;Wirtschaft lief,

Der Mythos überhaupt. Erstens: Die Weltwirtschaftskrise ging so oder so zu Ende, ein wirtschaftlicher Aufschwung begann schon vor Hitler.
Zweitens: Der Beitrag Hitlers zum Wirtschaftswachstum war absolut nicht nachhaltig. Das Wirtschaftswachstum wurde durch Pump finanziert, der Deutschland in den finanziellen Ruin getrieben hätte. (Soweit ich weiß, wurde WK II deshalb verfrüht begonnen, da Deutschland kurz vor der Staatspleite stand.) Zum anderen wurde viel Geld durch die Verfolgung der Juden erworben. Faktisch wurden diese enteignet und dadurch gelangte ihr Geld in die Hände anderer. Dadurch gab es einen Vermögenszuwachs der ""Deutschen"" aus dem Vermögen der Juden.
beide deutschsprachigen Länder vereinigt,
Auch hier wieder, meinetwegen.
&gt;renomierte Wissenschaftler treiben das Weltwissen voran

Falsch. In der Tat war Deutschland in den zwanziger Jahren das Zentrum der Wissenschaft weltweit. Allerdings haben gerade die Nazis die vielen ausländischen oder jüdischen Wissenschaftler aus dem Land getrieben, die meisten sind in die USA ausgewandert. Tatsächlich haben die Nazis den Wissenschaftsstandort Deutschland ruiniert.

&gt;Was gabs sonst Schlechtes? Wenn sie nicht den Krieg angefangen 
&gt;hätten und die ""Nicht-Arischen"" in Ruhe gelassen hätten, fällt mir
&gt;spontan nur ein dass es eine Autokratie war.

Sowohl Krieg anfangen als auch die Gängelung der ""Nicht-Arischen"" war eine inhärente Notwendigkeit des Dritten Reiches. Wie ich oben schrieb erfolgte das zusätzliche Wirtschaftswachstum durch die massive Aufrüstung auf Pump und die Enteignung der Juden. (Auch beim Anschluss Österreichs wurde viel Gold aus der österreichischen Zentralbank gewonnen.

&gt;Aber wie in Spanien hätte sich doch trotzdem irgendwann die
&gt;Demokratie samt Menschenrechten durchgesetzt. Aber Deutschland
&gt;würde viel besser dastehen heute.

Nun, das ganze ist spekulativ, aber ich würde behaupten, dass Deutschland heute massiv von dem zweiten Weltkrieg profitiert.
Erstens hat der zweite Weltkrieg England und Frankreich ebenfalls massiv getroffen, England hat ja unter anderem deswegen sehr rasch sein Kolonialreich verloren. Die deutsche Wirtschaft wurde dank Marshall-Plan neu aufgebaut, wärend die Engländer auf dem Vorkriegsstand waren. In Europa gab es eine Neuordnung. Deutschland (und auch die anderen Länder) wurden zur Zusammenarbeit gezwungen. Aus ehemaligen Feinden wurden vielleicht nicht Freunde aber wenigstens Partner. Sicher auch dadurch, dass jetzt Amerika Weltmacht war und nicht mehr die europäischen Mächte gab es kaum mehr innereuropäische Spannungen. (Wir haben seit fast 70 Jahren keinen Krieg mehr in Zentraleuropa gehaupt, mit Ausnahme Jugoslawien. Das hat es meines Wissens nach nie zuvor gegeben.)
Möglicherweise hätte eine Bedrohung Europas durch Stalin eine ähnliche Wirkung gehabt. Das bischen Landgewinn durch Hitler war zwar nett, aber IMHO nicht wichtig.

&gt;tl;dr: Wären die Nazis etwas weniger als total fanatisch gewesen, &gt;wäre die Bewertung der Zeit ihrer Herrschaft eine diametral andere.

tl;dr: Die Nazis haben eigentlich nichts positives bewirkt. Sie haben die besten Wissenschaftler ins Ausland getrieben und den Staat bis kurz vor den Bankrott gewirtschaftet. Ohne den Krieg wäre Hitler der letzte Depp 
gewesen und Deutschland heute vielleicht total am Ende, weil teil der Sowjetunion.

Non per qualche complotto particolare (che secondo me non c'è assolutamente in questo subreddit), ma perché, come spesso accade, esponi situazioni al limite dell'inverosimile (un gruppo che influenzi tutto /r/italy mi pare assai improbabile) e te la prendi se qualcuno ti fa notare che molto probabilmente hai preso un granchio colossale.


Che vi sia un problema con la reddiquette è palese, ma è in tutto reddit, non solo in questo subreddit. La gente tende a vedere il downvote come un ""non mi piace"", ""non sono d'accordo"" e non come un ""questa cosa non c'entra nulla con la discussione"" o un ""stai uccidendo la discussione con questi toni"".

Su questo non possono farci nulla i MOD ed è fisiologico che molti downvote arrivino per questo motivo. Di fatto però quei downvote spesso vengono riequilibrati (da chi usa gli upvote seguendo lo stesso erroneo ragionamento) quindi difficilmente portano a downvote di massa: forse ti conviene iniziare a contemplare che è possibile che qualcuna delle tue idee non sia proprio così ragionata e così *concreta* come credi e che da quello derivi il downvote.

&gt;The exact program of Lega Nord was not clear in the early years: some opponents claimed it wanted secession of Padania, while at other times it appeared to be requesting only autonomy for northern regions. The League eventually settled on federalism, which rapidly became a buzzword and a popular issue in most Italian political parties. In 1996 the party switched to open separatism, calling for the independence of Padania. As a symbolic act of birth of the new nation, on 13 September 1996 Bossi took a bottle of water from the springs of Po River (Latin: Padus, hence Padania), which was poured in the sea of Venice by a little girl two days later. A voluntary group of militants, the ""Green Volunteers"", often referred as ""green shirts"" (green being the colour of Padania), was also established. The renewed alliance with Berlusconi in 2001 forced the party to tone down and Padania became the name of a proposed ""macro-region"", going back to the ideas by Miglio: an Italian federal republic, divided into three ""macro-regions"" (""Padania"", ""Etruria"" and the ""South""). The new buzzword devolution (often used in English) was also introduced, but with less success than ""federalism"". This decision caused some criticism from party ranks and led to the formation of some minor breakaway factions. As observed above, the peculiarity of Lega Nord among European regionalist parties is that its main goal is the transformation of Italy into a federal state instead of simply demanding special rights and autonomy for northern regions.

Anyway, Padania is a recent political invention. If you want some real indipendentist movements, you should look at Venetian, Sardinian and Sicilian ones.",0,1410447054,null,0,false,0,ckfcqbj,t3_2g3gch,t1_ckfcqbj,t1_ckf9g7t,null,1427073013,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

There will obviously be short term economic problems because of the uncertainty independence would cause, but I'm willing to forego that in order to get a better government.

What **does** worry me is some of the blatantly stupid nationalist rhetoric. ""*When we're independent, the first thing we'll do is demand England underwrites all our debt in a currency union! If it doesn't, we'll just default! That'll show them!!!""* That is such a frightening demonstration of fiscal irresponsibility that it makes me suspect the SNP would turn Scotland into Greece before 2020.

Britain has only been frustrating much needed reform and regulation in this sector and besides that generally acted like a spoilt child with regards to anything that might bring even a bit of short term cost in order to realise long term gains or better living standards for European citizens. They want their cake, and eat it too. Want to profit from everything Europe has to offer without paying a single penny to it, or abide by any regulation that isn´t immediately convenient.

So yes, Id like them to stay in the EU, since Britain is European wether they like it or not, but if they keep behaving like they have, especially with regards to banks and financial institutions, I think we´d probably all be better off if they just dragged themselves into the Atlantic and joined their American brethren.

Do you see what im getting at here? If not ill explain, because you dont seem too bright i might have to go into some detail.

And this is why i said you are **functionally** illiterate. I gave you an example why NK is **not** democratic **despite** the word democratic in its name and you think that i meant that NK is democratic? God... please dont procreate.

&gt;WRONG, this is foreign organisations promoting civil liberties and democracy even if its to the detriment of the west.

[National Endowment for Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy#Criticisms): ""very little to do with democracy. It is an organization that uses US tax money to actually subvert democracy, by showering funding on favored political parties or movements overseas. It underwrites color-coded ‘people’s revolutions’ overseas that look more like pages out of Lenin’s writings on stealing power than genuine indigenous democratic movements.""

Just because its named ""for democracy"" it doesnt mean it is pro-democracy. That is why governments decide to have oversight over NGO workings. 

&gt;The usually fractious oppositions have to be united behind a single candidate if there is to be any chance of unseating the regime. That leader is selected on pragmatic and objective grounds, even if he or she is anti-American.

You do know this is NOT democracy? Democracy is native people picking up their leader without outside interference. And im yet to see Americans sponsoring anyone that is anti-American. Feel free to give me examples that prove me wrong.

&gt;Hungary wanted the NGOs fundings sent to the government first. They said the government would distribute the funds to the NGOs as they saw fit.

So? Its their country and they decide what goes on there.

But, they are (or at least sound like) responses to 2 different situations or questions (time of day, versus day of the week).   
And, remember, you'll usually have context clues to help you determine what the speaker means.  
  
For example, you have a week off of work, and would like to hitch a ride to Uni every day:  
""Ich brauch' diese Woche nicht zu Arbeiten, wann fährst du (normalerweise) zur Uni?""  
""Ich fahre morgens zur Uni.""  
The reply: ""Ich fahre morgen zur Uni."" would not be answering your question.  
  
However, if you need one specific ride, perhaps to talk to a Professor, then:  
""Ich muss diese Woche meinen Jura Professor sprechen, wann fährst du (demnächst) zur Uni?""  
""Ich fahre morgen zur Uni.""    
The reply: ""Ich fahre morgens zur Uni."" would not be answering your question directly, however, if your friend wanted to be sure you understood ""tomorrow morning"", he'd say: ""Ich fahre morgen früh zur Uni.""  
  
Note: the words ""normalerweise"" and ""demnächst"" are optional and would help make your questions crystal-clear about whether you're interested in knowing either the time of day, or day of the week.

No, not even the former large-ish secessionist party pushes for it anymore.

&gt; What is the reason in the first place that the idea of an independent northern Italy could rise and survive till today?

The North of Italy is the richest most developed portion of the country, and has largely been so since unification in the 19th century. It's no surprise that someone has thought of cutting off the 'dead weight' and going it alone.

&gt; Are the cultural differences that big?

Not really, especially since millions and millions of people from the South emigrated North and mass media further eroded much of the former cultural divergence.

By the way, if it were in any way realistic I would definitely support the North of Italy breaking off. In every metric, the North of Italy is a region comparable with the wealthiest and most developed in Europe, while the South of Italy is underdeveloped, obscenely corrupt and apparently completely incapable of self-reform, among the worst in Europe.

The one region of Moldova with strong pro-Russian sympathies, Transnistria, is already under the *de facto* control of pro-Russian separatists. The rest of the Russian/Russian speaking minorities in Moldova are largely scattered in a few cities and a handful of villages, but the overwhelming majority of the country consists of rural areas populated by ethnic Moldovans/Romanians.

true,Finnish_Jager,UNSA,United States,"&gt; Without a UN mandate air strikes on another country are an act of aggression

ISIS is not it's own country. If you mean the country *in* the airstrikes will be occurring, then they'll need Syrian approval. The US already has approval for strikes in Iraq.

&gt; Last year the American public were war fatigued to the point they wanted no involvement in Syria

American non-involvement in Syria was more complicated than just some opinion polls.

The targets for American airstrikes are different than a year ago. It's a more complicated Libyan no-fly-zone then, vs. terrorists today.

&gt; too busy infighting with other rebel groups to pose any real threat to the West.

It doesn't have to be a ""threat to the West"" for America and European military's to act. To some degree it's our responsibility to help people suffering and solve the humanitarian crisis in the region.

Man muss sich einfach mal angucken wie unglaublich MacGyverisch Mods, Texture Packs usw. funktionieren, was fürn Flickenteppich die Engine ist (die immer noch unter unterirdischer Performance leidet), wie schlecht Multiplayer funktioniert, und wie kompliziert editing tools zu benutzen sind etc.

Es ist ganz offensichtlich so das Minecraft nie dafür gedacht war diese ganzen Features die es jetzt gibt zu beinhalten.

Eine große Minecraft Produktion muss nicht zwangsläufig auf all die Mods verzichten. Ganz im Gegenteil, wenn die Karten richtig gespielt werden kann es sogar noch viel mehr Möglichkeiten geben. Man muss sich ja nur Skyrim angucken um zu sehen das AAA Titel mit gutem Mod support gut ankommen. Wenn man von Haus aus machtvolle, übersichtliche Tools geliefert bekommt, kombiniert mit nem cleveren Mod launcher gibt es Möglichkeiten von denen Minecraft Modder momentan wirklich nur träumen können.

Wenn man zum Beispiel viele Möglichkeiten hat NPCs zu skripten, so dass sie mit verschiedenen Dingen interagieren können, dann könnt jemand ankommen und ein Dwarf Fortressigen Mod bauen.

Die Sammlung möglicher features auf die Modder aufgreifen können ist riesig. Ich meine nicht halbgare Konzepte die von einer einzelnen Person irgendwie ins Spiel reingehackt werden wie z.B. Redstone, sondern wirklich richtig gut umgesetzte Features.

Ob Microsoft jetzt unbedingt die richtigen sind um ein mächtiges Minecraft 2 zum entwickeln, und ob sie überhaupt Interesse haben sich in diese Richtung zu orientieren, will ich jetzt mal im Raum stehen lassen. 

Für mich ists jedoch Fakt dass ein großes, kompetentes Studio mit viel Geld und ausreichend Zeit ein Spiel programmieren könnte das noch viel mehr Möglichkeiten als Minecraft hat, und sich dabei auch noch gut anfühlt und gut aussieht.

edit: Was Monetarisierung angeht steht man bei sowas natürlich vor einem Problem - wenn man modden kann, wer wird dann Mikrotransaktionen und derartigen Unsinn benutzen? Das ist natürlich ein Knackpunkt. Wenn viel Geld in die Hand genommen wird will man auch profitieren, und zwar wenn möglich langfristig.

I sometimes wonder how strong the ties between British politics and the British press still are. I tend to guess that those bonds are very strong, given how much of a coordinated effort there seems to be against the EU for example.

true,christ0ph,UNSA,Pangea,"TISA ignores the fact that the 2008 global economic crisis happened because of deregulation.

It tries to force much more of it.  TISA is the one that attempts to effect services the most. So, its easy to say TTIP wont impact services, if you pretend that TISA doesnt exist. 

***TISA,*** **is the FTA that is supposed to impact services.**  

They can and do it seems, happily say ***TTIP*** wont, even as they are almost certainly negotiating in secret to use TISA to dismantle them. 

This is how they have been shown to operate here in the USA.  

Google for the exchange between the Maine Citizens Trade Commission and the USTR over GATS and Dirigo Health, the state-based healthcare provider that Maine had to give up because it was unable to do what it needed to do to lower costs, because of GATS. 

Then look at the misleading campaign in Vermont for what they call ""single payer"" but which is actually a big nothing, which seems to ignore the fact that real single payer in the US is made impossible by GATS. 

As other jobs vanish, healthcare begins to take on a very unhealthy aspect where its increasingly looked to as a cash cow which can be milked for revenue. 

That goal is inherently in conflict with healthcare affordability. 

The legislators in the US on both sides of the aisle are complicit in their silence about GATS. They all are trying to hide its implications. All seem to be joining in trying to hide the very real and ugly fact that GATS and now these additional new pending FTAs bend over backwards to block every single thing that could make healthcare affordable in the US.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"I don't think it's that clear cut. To me, China (or the Chinese government) is simply looking out for its own best interest in a very pragmatic manner. The only thing is, they're not being shy about it and don't happen to deploy propaganda to sway *foreign* population, as the US and Europe are doing. What can also be said is that, over the past 30 years, Chinese policy has to a great extend benefited many Chinese who are not part of the ruling class. Their policies, while illiberal, seem to be more along the lines of enligthened paternal despotism than an autocratic regime aimed at subduing the population in favour of the well-being of a tiny elite. What makes China one of the most difficult but also one of the most predictable and beneficial partners is that you can deal with them like you deal with an absolutely ruthless and profit-seeking corporation. And I doubt they'd hold it against us if we do. 

All in all, my impression is that they're set on a goal to dominate at least their region and won't let anyone stand in their way. However, it doesn't seem to me that they'd be particularly irratated by not dominating either the US or Europe, as long as they have enough control to secure their own position. If history has taught China anything at all is that China needs political stability, and that's exactly what their government is pursuing.

Russia as it is now on the other hand goes head-to-head with our current European ambitions to expand the EU/NATO and achieve a stable European continent, disregarding the needs of their own population in favour of Putin's oligarchy. Indeed, their whole strategy is aimed at undermining the current political stability of the continent. 

In this respect, Russia and China are the complete opposite and we shouldn't make the mistake of tagging the Chinese as enemies just because their system of government and their values are different. We should rather look at who is aiming to undermine our security and stability with an aim to divide us, opening us like a tin can to take away whatever they want.  

Edit: I'd also like to add is that I'd be very surprised if we ever see a long-lasting Russian-Chinese friendship. Chinese ambitions to become the hegemonic power in East Asia go against the very existence of a strong Russian state in the East. Their partnership can only be one of opportunity, and a very short one at that with China coming out on top.

Seeing as we and China have no real territorial conflicts and a world in wealth to gain from economic co-operation (done right), the only problem we'll be facing is their resource-hunger, seen for example in how they take bites off the African continent.

true,almareado,PORT,Algarve - Portugal,"* **Angola**

I'd say there's more of a business relationship with Angola, rather than friendship. Many Portuguese have fond feelings for the country, but many Angolans still look at the Portuguese as those to blame for all their problems. Luckily not all, and many Portuguese are emigrating there to get better paying jobs. Some stay but most can't adapt to the anacronisms of Angola. Truth be told, Angola is probably the least favourite ex-colony of Portugal, for more reasons than i care to develop in this post.

Many Angolans came to Portugal in the past decades in search of a better education and a better life. Some created new roots here, others used their education and go back to work in Angola's big companies (mostly those with connections).  

* **Cape Verde**
* **S. Tomé e Príncipe**

Our relationship with Cape Verde and S. Tomé is pretty similar in every way. We've taken thousands of people over the years and there's big comunities of people from these countries in Portugal. 

In Portugal the image of these countries is more positive than that of Angola. People are warmer and not so arrogant. Awesome countries for some vacation too. 

* **Mozambique**

Mozambique has been somewhat neglected diplomatically in recent years, despite having a big Portuguese community and many Portuguese of Mozambique origin living in Portugal. 

Recently though, Portugal participated in an initiative to end military operations from RENAMO, with the Portuguese Embassador travelling to deep Mozambique with other international dignataries, to escort Afonso Dhlakama, RENAMO's leader, to Maputo safely. 

* **Guiné-Bissau**

Portuguese relations with the current government in Bissau are strained after a chain of coups, accusations from the military (the same that are involved in drug trafficking) that the Portuguese and Angolans wanted to take over their military and more recently the forcing of Syrian refugees into a TAP airplane, breaking the trust of both the Portuguese government and TAP, which led to the decision to stop flying to Bissau.

The situation seems to be deescalating, and flights may resume soon. This is a big deal because there are a lot of Guineans in Portugal that regularly fly there to visit their family.

* **Brasil**

Portuguese consider Brasil as a brotherly country, and while many Brazilians still harbor confused ideas about Portugal, others see it as their brethren across the Atlantic. 

Portuguese consume a lot of Brazilian media, so it's natural that we understand them better than they understand us. Economy-wise, Portugal's main impact in Brasil has been in the telecomunication business. Despite recent troubles, it seems that Portuguese telecom giant PT is going ahead and merge with Oi, South America's biggest telecom.

* **Timor Lorosae**

Portuguese are very fond of Timor, being one of the key pushers for its independence, and from the little information i can gather the feeling is mutual. They have mad respect for the Portuguese paramilitary police that helped keep order in the years following their independence. GNR's performance in Timor was outstanding as both a peacekeeping and public relations effort.

The idea that Transnstria could launch a successful invasion of Moldova is frankly absurd. It's true that Moldova's military is woefully unprepared and under-equipped, but Transnistria's forces are not really in a significantly better state. Moreover, by far the biggest cause for confidence is that Transnitria doesn't have a direct border with Russia, so Russia could not intervene anywhere near as decisively as they have been able to do in eastern Ukraine. 

With all this in mind, and knowing that Moldova would probably receive some level of assistance from Europe (material if not military), and with the advantage of fighting on our own territory, I think even Moldova's paltry forces could chase away any Transnistrian attack, fighting with [cheerful faces and heroic hearts like our Orthodox brothers from the 5th Kozara division did two decades ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuDXaw1n8LU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=31).

Essentially, supporting it would give you one of two extremes, a good or a bad one. Opposing it would give you neutrality and some stability, which, if you're reasonably comfortable and happy with life, is not something you want to lose.

Except, right now, if it passes - `P(good)` is *perceived as* lower than `P(bad)`, because governments aren't trusted, especially the American one.

true,Bartsches,null,null,"&gt;No, but the fact Europe and Russia are bitching with one another is neither reason nor justification to hit Asian airlines, regardless of whether the consequences of Europe/Russia is an advantage to Asia. They have nothing to do with it. And they would be likely to hit back, e.g. Europe imposes financial constraints on Asian airlines flying over EU airspace, and in return Asian countries impose the same restrictions on Europe. Its a ridiculous cycle of events that fucks everyone.

There is no reason to hit Asian airlines which fly over Europe and they won't be hit. That's completely different from the matter at hand.


&gt;That depends what the policy is. As has been suggested, Europe would impose sanctions on Russia and Russia exclusively. Europe would then choose whether it wants to impose sanctions on all other planes as well. They are two very different things.

This can be different things, in this case it's probably not, as the main target is the Russian state and not the airlines. As such the main sanctions would be the loss of the traffic money of the airplanes flying above Russia. Again no Asian airline is directly targeted. All contenters do have a bit higher operating costs sure, but that equal to a tax increase on fuel for example in which case there wouldn't be a justification for sanctions as well.


&gt; I completely agree, but getting involved is just imposing the same sanctions on European airlines that you suggest Europe could or should impose on Asian ones. That's not getting involved in anything militaristic, its just responding in kind to airline sanctions imposed on you.

Still it would mark a very heavy diplomatic crisis. Also as there is little difference in the before all sanctions - after all sanctions business there is hardly a justification for any Asian sanctions. The key here is that the European sanctions do not attack Asian airlines in a way which would make them disadvantaged compared to their contenders which would also fall under the sanctions. The EU sanctions would also forbid any EU airline to move over Russia, independant of Russian reglementations. This is about comparable to a temporary closed airspace for other reasons, which actually regulary happens and which no state ever had a problem with unless it interferes with them directly.",0,1410454019,null,0,false,0,ckfga0w,t3_2fvsox,t1_ckfga0w,t1_ckedydx,null,1427070872,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Both the Count of Flanders and the King of England were vassals of the French King, which was also an enemy they shared later on. There was also a lot of trade between Flanders and England/Scotland. And immigration, we lost a lot of population to the British Isle who fled for wars and the unstable political situation in Flanders. Or our weavers who were lured there by the English king.

These days more anglophones associate Flanders with a cartoon character than the region where the surname actually originated from. Although that percentage will probably be lower in the UK. So join us in irrelevancy and be happy that you will always be more relevant than (the duchy of) Brabant, haha.

Concernant l'impact sur nous, je pense vraiment que si on en parlait pas, et qu'on arretait d'en parler comme si ils etaient a nos portes, leur impact serait quasi nul. Ces groupes ils prosperent grace a l'importance qu'ils arrivent a se donner. Je ne dis pas que ce sont des groupes qui ne peuvent rien faire, mais je dis qu'il faut les traiter comme tel en publique. Biensur qu'il faut surveiller et tenter d'empecher des gens de nos pays d'aller se former la-bas pour ensuite revenir et commettre des actes ici, mais c'est pas en allant les bombarder qu'on va ralentir ce phénomène, au contraire ca risque encore plus de les encourager. Ca fait  depuis le debut de l'humanite que les armees qui s'attaquent a des groupes disperses sur leurs territoires se ramassent et ne produisent rien et c'est pas demain la veille qu'on va reussir a obtenir des resultats, donc oui je ne vois juste pas en quoi ces frappes qui vont surement tuer autant de bouclier humains civils que des soldats de l'E.I. vont faire avancer les choses.

Macao was handed peacefully to China in 1999, and many of the Portuguese living there returned to Portugal. Portuguese is still an official language there but since Macau is a part of China, there isn't much interactivity with the region. China, however, is a big investor in Portugal and has bought our public Energy Company, mainly due to it's know-how in renewable energy generation. In 500 years, this is likely a high point in Cino-Portuguese relations.

Goa is a whole different matter. There are plenty of Goans and Goan descendants in Portuguese society, aswell as Goan influence in Portuguese cousine, but any and all connection with the territory of Goa ended when Nehru invaded. Portugal made a weak attempt at pushing for it's independence later, but with no success. AFAIK, Goans still have a right to Portuguese citizenship, and some in Goa try to keep their connection to Portuguese culture alive, but not in enough numbers to justify a formal ""relationship"".

Goa, Daman and Diu are probably the least mentioned ex-colonies in contemporary Portugal. My personal take is that of all the colonies, they are the only ones that got annexed by another country and didn't manage to become independent states. Some feel that we failed Goans, even when there was literally nothing to be done.

I'm not sure what you are saying here.

&gt;  What if you break the treaty and sanction someone it would have more of a middle and long term consequences and instigate a spiral of ""responses"" followed by the other side ""reacting"" to not look weak and ""stand by its European Allies""? 

Break which treaty? I'm a little confused by your arguement here, but both the EU and Russia are already engaged in a spiralling game of tit-for-tat sanctions, and while Russia's responses have admittedly been much less potent than those issued from Brussells it's actions against Estonia and Poland are still indicative of a state that wants to be seen to respond aggressively to external pressure. I cannot see any ""allies"" entering into this engagement who aren't already embedded in it; the EU and US have already made their stance clear and Russia does not have allies that would be willing to risk economic and diplomatic relations with those two entities to join it in sanctions for no gain for themselves. Likewise the idea that any further countries would opt-in to sanctioning Moscow seems unlikely, although I suppose it is conceivable that this could change in the unlikely event that irrefutable proof arises from the MH17 investigation that the Putin regime is to blame for the destruction of the plane.

&gt; What if people often overreact to any bad news and create even more problems/complications, than they initially envisioned? 

I don't think anyone is unsure about the nature of the sanctions/invasion of Ukraine escalating. In fact Merkel's hesitancy in particular to commit to stronger sanctions, as well as Russians own limited sanctions, speaks volumes on this. Although it is true that the amount of sanctions Russia could conceivably bring to bear against the EU/US without damaging it's own economy severely is, at best, moderate.

&gt; There are others what ifs like how population perceives sanctions, who controls ""the perceiving mechanism"" and so on. 

There have been several polls and articles in the media in recent weeks on this topic. The citizenry of the EU seem to be strongly in favour of not just continuing sanctions but continuing to escalate them, and while I haven't seen any polls on the Russian people's opinions of their own sanctions, given the ongoing strong support of Putin and the events in Ukraine I would imagine they are also in support of continuing the current situation.

&gt; Why is everything so simplistic and people think that if Russia would immediately stop the support for ""rebels"" everything happen prior to that would magically go away 

Well for several reasons, mostly because the heads of state of the EU have repeatedly **said** that **this is exactly what it will take to stop the sanctions against Russia**; full withdrawal of forces from Ukraine's sovereign territory, full withdrawal of backing of pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas, and in all likelihood reparations for the damage inflicted on Ukraine by Russia.

&gt; in a span of 1 month with zero consequences for respective parties involved?

No-one is under any illusions that this will be the case. Russia has opened Pandora's box and the reprecussions for the invasion of Ukraine will be felt for years diplomatically. What it can control now is how long the effects will be felt *economically.* What some pro-Russian posters fail to understand, and I say this with no arrogance but as diplomatically as possible, is that these sanctions are not going away. These sanctions are in lieu of military intervention in an armed invasion of a neighbour state to the EU. The EU is not willing to mount an armed invasion, but they are concerned with protecting their neighbour, and their own interests in that region. And yes, part of this is checking the advance of an apparently rapacious Putin regime. So the sanctions will continue to escalate until Russia accedes to frankly absurdly reasonable demands. The Russian energy market, which shores up the entire economy, has already been hit with sanctions in it's oil industry. The obvious endgame option is sanctioning of the energy market in it's entirety, particularly the enormous gas market, and preventing Russia from accessing European capital markets; the result of which would very likely be the collapse of the Russian economy altogether, which nobody is eager to see.
Russia can continue to reply with it's own sanctions or threats of other actions, but the only real power it wields in Europe is a) an enormous military, which it will not utilize against an EU or NATO member-state, and b) it's supply of energy, which it cannot wield in great effect because of the overreliance of the Russian economy upon the energy market. What we're likely to see from Russian are a continuation of it's tactics of targeting one or two of the smaller states with harsh actions, such as it's limiting (or cessation?) of supply of gas to Poland. Considering Poland's contribution to the EU these days I'd expect to see a large fallout from this action however; Poland is very much a different country than the one that left the USSR. Threatening Finland not to join NATO, the kidnapping of the Estonian counter-intelligence agent, threatening to close it's airways to EU airlines, these are the kinds of aggressive tactics I'd imagine we'd see more of.

I've often seen Russian posters compare their country's invasion of Ukraine to the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq, which is in some ways extremely fair. But there are two points to consider here that differentiate those two conflicts (aside from the concepts of annexation versus exploitation of natural resources):

1. Russia does not have the power that the USA did then (or does now) to mount this invasion unopposed, whether militarily, economically or diplomatically.
2. The actors in the theatre of Eastern Europe are much more united, willing to act, and invested in the resolution of this conflict than the states of the Middle East were, or were willing to be, in 2004.

This is why Russia is seeing economic sanctions and diplomatic hostility that it cannot shake, which seems to have taken even the Putin administration by surprise, which is why I assume they are making such loud noises about their new BFFs China and Iran. There's also little Russia can do to get rid of this situation short of complying with demands; the Russian military is hands-down the largest in the region and a very formidable force that would likely overrun Ukraine if brought to bear, but it can't use this force against it's chief opponents because both NATO and the EU have militaries that could subdue it.

So far Kiev did everything it could to alienate Russia and gave zero incentive for negotiations or any deescalation hopes.

&gt; I don't see how they could've been separate states. They're too small, and don't have enough historical base to support nationalism.

[A list of small, yet independent states.](http://geography.about.com/cs/countries/a/smallcountries.htm)

I'll address the second part of your assumption next.

&gt;As for the claims, the regions share language, history and religion with regions around it and except for the Portuguese rule they are the same. Konkani is spoken in Goa and also as far as regions ~350 km away. Marathi is spoken in Goa and also pretty much in every region surrounding Goa, and even as far off as ~1000 km away. Daman &amp; Diu are pretty much really tiny, barely-populated-with-tribals fishing/tourist spots. The French too ceded their enclaves, although peacefully. Not sure what you mean here.

The Portuguese were in Goa for nearly 500 years, so you can't simply neglect the influence of Portuguese culture in these communities. A good example is Galicia, a Spanish region north of Portugal. Portuguese culture is also known as the Galaico-Portuguese culture due to their common roots. However, after all these centuries of being separated, Galicians are now closer to the Spanish (Castillian) culture than Portuguese.

The same thing happened in Goa. Goans had their own culture by the time they were annexed by India, a culture that was formed by both their own Indian roots and European costumes/religion. 

Which brings me to the propaganda pushed by Nehru, that the Portuguese were colonial masters just like the English and that he'd be *freeing* Goans from the claws of the Portuguese. 

In fact, Goan was more autonomous during Portuguese rule than it ever was under India. Most of the administration was done by Goans, and many Goans became high society members in Portugal. Many of these families still have relevant positions in Portuguese politics. 

So yeah, there was a lot of prejudice and a need to galvanize the Indian people by *defeating* the European colonizer by invading a tiny piece of land where people were by all accounts living better than in the rest of India. 

That isn't to say Portugal has or had any rights to Goa, but it certainly should give Goans legitimacy to govern themselves if they chose to. 

Finally, Portugal did purpose the Indian government the same deal we had with the Chinese. Transitional period, and then a smooth transfer. But that wouldn't have much appeal to the then highly nationalistic young India.

Looking at how Macau turned out, i personally think that would've benefited Goans the most. ",0,1410457512,null,0,false,0,ckfi491,t3_2g2yy4,t1_ckfi491,t1_ckfhc9q,null,1427069778,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

The one region of ~~Moldova~~ Ukraine with strong pro-Russian sympathies, ~~Transnistria~~ Crimea, is already under the de facto control of pro-Russian separatists.

Wrong again my friend. **Democracy is when the population of a given geographic area vote for who they believe best represents them and their interests.**

It has nothing to do with outside influence. It has everything to do with citizens being educated about current situations and getting them the correct information. Do you think these NGOs are coercing hungarian citizens to vote for the people they support?

How naive can you be? Im literally astounded right now that you are this dumb.

That is a silly thing to say. Corporations are not all investment banks (and actually, until the last few decades, they were mainly partnerships). Non-profits are often corporations. Many small businesses are organized as a corporation. Hell, I am 1/3 owner of a corporation and I certainly am not anywhere near the wealthy class of people. Most corporations are not on Wall Street or even have publicly traded shares. 

Most corporations are closely held and owned by the main employee. If corporations are built on greed, any employment is built on greed and needs to be kept in check.

true,Fluimucil,null,null,"&gt;The English identity has been a quiet identity for years. Historically people in England have been much more hesitant about their identity compared to other parts of the UK (English tend not to self-identify as English, tend to wave their flag less). 

Well it's normal, it's actual quite common and appears in every country in the world : minority are always way much more demonstrative of their pride and their attachment to their own identity.

The gay pride or black history month are extreme exemple of this : the white anglo saxon heterosexual male is the normative element of the american society, it has been the ""default setting"" of the american citizen for most of american history. The country has more or less been made for this identity. Thus there is no need for him to demonstrate his pride or his love of what he is for he's never been threatened for being himself, unlike the gay man or the black man. He doesn't have to prove that he isn't a freak or that he can achieve anything.

Well it's more or less the same with european countries : even if, of course, there isn't anything remotely close to the oppresive relationship between the white heterosexual man and the black/gay man in the relationship between a country and its regions, there is still a ""dominant"" normative identity in every single european country, relegating the less prestigious or powerful identity to a lesser role.

In France, it's the parisian french identity that completely submitted any other local identity. Thus you won't see any kind of political regionalism or identity pride in Paris : France as a whole already is the suburb of Paris.
Same thing with Spain and Catalonia.

...And same thing with the United Kingdom.

British people, english people in particular, don't like to hear it, but the relationship between Scotland and England has *never* been equal. Scotland, alongside Wales and Ireland, has always been dominated by England, politically, economically and culturally.

Of course it doesn't mean that scot were repressed like the irish were. But it does mean that over the years, scottish identity fade away. It means that they slowly abandonned their celtic language, for the language of the anglo-norman invader, and then once they rebuilt an identity formed with theses anglo-norman people, they abandonned it for the english one, letting scottish english behind to speak english english.

Today, the reality is that Scotland doesn't have a cultural identity particulary more pronunced that the one of a german lander or even of a french region. Scotland is a suburb of London.

And for a lot of people, it isn't really a problem, they love being a part of the United Kingdom, being british. They consider that while such a cultural domination was real in the past everything changed : with the union of 1707 a new identity was born, erasing the scottman and the englishman to create the britishman.

But many other don't, and thus demonstrate their love for the scottish identity. Because the reality is that the english identity is nearly entirely equal to the british identity.

In a game of civ when you go to war with another country with which you have a trading agreement, you immediately loose the resources you were trading with thus penalty is *immediately* effective. Sanctions do not operate like that, they have more of a mid and long term effects which would cripple future growth and create a number of problems later down the line. 

If you were to get on the ""hype train"" of sanctions and fail to recognize when to jump off the loco, you might create a bigger mess than you initially intended to be. Thats all i am saying.


&gt;Breal which treaty? I'm a little confused by your arguement here, but both the EU and Russia are already engaged in a spiralling game of tit-for-tat sanctions


I agree, we are already on the path of ""who is going to inflict the most amount of damage for the other side"", but **the desirable** outcome for Europe might slightly deviate from the path that Russia will choose. Basically i think we *both* might loose more than we initially wanted, with some very ugly developments further down the line. 


&gt;I don't think anyone is unsure about the nature of the sanctions/invasion of Ukraine escalating. In fact Merkel's hesitancy in particular to commit to stronger sanctions, as well as Russians own limited sanctions, speaks volumes on this. Although it is true that the amount of sanctions Russia could conceivably bring to bear against the EU/US without damaging it's own economy severely is, at best, moderate.


I see this a bit differently, in my opinion Merkel has caved in into hawks and is on a path of non-stop sanctions every other month,regardless of Ukrainians developments (non-stop pressure until unconditional surrender so to speak). It is unlikely that Russia will tolerate such treatment, so ""voice of reason"" would be drown in ""hawkishness"" from both sides -&gt; thus making things even worse. 


&gt; Well for several reasons, mostly because the heads of state of the EU have repeatedly said that this is exactly what it will take to stop the sanctions against Russia; full withdrawal of forces from Ukraine's sovereign territory, full withdrawal of backing of pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas, and in all likelihood reparations for the damage inflicted on Ukraine by Russia.


So, Russia must admit that it basically has lost what it considers as its own backyard or ""sphere of influence"", pay the reparations + quietly roll over and die to its Western Overlords? Are you a big fan of Treaty of Versailles by chance? 

You do realize that this is an equivalent of political suicide for Putin&amp;co, right? 


On a side note, how would you describe the role of Turkey in Syrian crisis (and other gulf states)? Not that i am engaged in whataboutism, but i do wonder why is that European officials has repeatedly traveled to Maidan to participate in protests against *elected democratically government* and did **nothing** for Turkish protests? Somethings gotta give, right? 


&gt;No-one is under any illusions that this will be the case. Russia has opened Pandora's box and the reprecussions for the invasion of Ukraine will be felt for years diplomatically. What it can control now is how long the effects will be felt economically. What some pro-Russian posters fail to understand, and I say this with no arrogance but as diplomatically as possible, is that these sanctions are not going away.


I am by no means a pro-Russian poster, what i am trying to advocate is a bit of restrain in eagerness to ""punish evil Russia"". Usually, tunnel visioning something is bad and while i do think that Europe will not lift sanctions out of nowhere, until conflict is over, the idea that Russia itself will stop unless it will be grated a *somewhat* desirable/acceptable outcome is naive. 

Thus the spiral continues.


&gt;TL;DR No-one believes this is going to end soon, but the only way it does end is with Russia acceding to demands to remove itself from Ukraine.


TL;DR to yours - Ukraine is in Western sphere of influence now, Russia can go fuck itself and cannot protect its national interests/backyard because it is too weak. Gotcha.

""Esistono cinque fatti poco noti sulle scoregge:  
1) Le scoregge sono merda senza massa.  
2) Esistono cinque tipi di scoregge: quella sonora e piena, quella doppia, quella sottile e compressa, quella umida e quella larga e soffice. Le donne producono di solito scoregge umide.  
3) Più silenziose sono, più puzzano. Lo dimostra l’esperimento di Carnap: se si fa una scoreggia rumorosa in una camera insonorizzata, puzza di più.   
4) Le scoregge degli altri hanno cattivo odore, le tue invece no, puzzano giuste. Ne fai una (pròot!), la annusi (sniff!), e dici: “Mmm, però!”.

As France deployed only a few thousand troops in Mali, the huge majority of its firepower/destructive ability was conducted by its brand new shiny Dassault Rafales.

Which country had the logistical ability of helping France with that? Uhm?

Scotland?

It may seem like a small detail for you, but that's that was the key of the whole operation.

If you have been paying attention, the current backlash against TTIP in Europe (which has been marred with unnecessary hysteria and suspicion) has caused the US to take a step back and reconsider how they approach new trade agreements.

The new strategy, assuming that TTIP doesn't pan out, is bilateral trade talks with individual European nations. I think that it's fairly obvious that the US would have far more leverage in negotiating a 1-on-1 trade deal with France than they would with the entire EU. 

Free trade is more or less inevitable in the Western world. The intransigence from the EU will not stop it from happening piecemeal if it comes to that.

See how the Eurozone goes: whenever something needs to be done France and Germany 'agree' on something and the smaller countries don't get a say. And since France won't let Germany decide and Germany doesn't trust France with money the answer is (almost always): more EU!

No clue how to fix the banks? Give it to the ECB they'll know what to do!

No clue how to enforce deficit reudction? Give it to the EU, they'll know!

Except the problem is that the EU is ran by the same politicians that (used to) run the national governments. And they, too, have no clue how to fix our banking system. But they just hand the power over to the EU/ECB and *after that* they expect the ECB to come up with a plan...

&gt;Isn't it silly to think the UK is the only thing preventing federalization and everyone else is onboard for it?

We can't leave. We're a German bundesstat economically speaking.. The point is not that no one is agianst it. The point is that the German-France line usually decides because none of the other countries can stop it.

I misread you on NK part. Sorry for that. Was trying to drive home the point that just because someone says he's pro democratic it does not mean he is. You apparently get that as far as NK goes but not in NGO case. 

""You are siding with the Hungarian Government on its crackdown on NGOs that promote human rights, equality and democracy"" - see? You presume that they are what they say they are. 

&gt;Wrong again my friend. Democracy is when the population of a given geographic area vote for who they believe best represents them and their interests.

Yep.

&gt;It has nothing to do with outside influence. It has everything to do with citizens being educated about current situations and getting them the correct information. Do you think these NGOs are coercing hungarian citizens to vote for the people they support?
How naive can you be? Im literally astounded right now that you are this dumb.

Nope. Outside influence can, and often does, represents foreign interests. It can also be antithetic to ""correct information"" and should not be allowed to run wild. 

I dont know what these NGOs are doing because i couldnt care less. Im saying that obviously according to the article they are not transparent and government decided to seize their documentation. 

&gt;I guess thats why you love North Korea so much, because they do what they want. Most of their population is destitute or in gulags and forced labour camps. They have to eat grass for fucks sake, or worse; each other.
Such a glorious sovereign nation. You make me fucking sick to my stomach. I will not reply to someone who condones the things the DPRK does to its people purely because of ""sovereignty "".

Aww cute. Its like when you accused me of being pro government when they allegedly crackdown on Hungarian freedomz and stuff.

I say NK is not democratic, you accuse me of being pro NK

And you wonder why i question your literacy?

&gt;Ah you evaded my question and just insult me again. You are one smart fellow. /s

You mention it is a violation of the democratic process, but all affected countries have to ratify it. Almost all cross border deals are first negotiated behind closed doors. 

The Canadian deal was and it contains an investor state dispute clause (virtually all FTAs do). Yet that was welcome with open arms. There is a deal with Japan currently being negotiated behind closed doors which is almost guaranteed to have an investor state dispute clause. No anger over this deal despite the fact Japanese tech giant Fujitsu recently won a £700 million judgment against the NHS for backing out of a deal (based on contract law, not a free trade agreement). I don't know of one example of an FTA that has been publicly negotiated (although they have to be ratified by legislatures, which gives the public a chance to comment).

TTIP would likely be fairly standard sharing many of the same characteristics as the Canadian and Japanese deal. Clearly the only reason people are upset is because it is being negotiated with the US.

A non-rhotic pronunciation is when the ""r"" is often not pronounced after a vowel, but it does still modify the sound of the vowel.

So if OP is American, he probably has a rhotic pronunciation, and the ""r"" in ""sir"" is very clearly pronounced. If OP is British, he may have a non-rhotic pronounciation, and then he would pronounce ""sir"" very much as if it were spelled ""söh"" in German. The ""r"" isn't pronounced, but it does make a difference to the vowel, which is why a non-rhotic speaker is actually correct in saying that, for him, ""ö"" sounds like the ""ur"" in ""burn"".

The are, by the way, rhotic dialects of British English (e.g. Westcountry, where everyone drinks ""zoiderrrrr"" instead of merely ""cider""), and non-rhotic dialects of American English (e.g. Boston, where the locals are teased about how ""fah"" they drive in their ""cahs"").",0,1410461216,null,0,false,0,ckfk37i,t3_2g456x,t1_ckfk37i,t1_ckfj1xq,null,1427068459,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

Yes, by some criteria you can say that Serbo-Croatian is a language, by others that Serbian and Croatian are languages and by third that Chakavian, Kajkavian, Western štokavian and Easter štokavian are languages. 

How can we tell that Czech, Bulgarian and Slovenian are different languages? Or are they at least western, eastern, southern? The criteria (as explained in the linked post) would be the development of the liquids *r and *l and the dentals *t and *d from Protoslavic and later on the accentuation. Using those criteria Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian are different languages as groups of dialects had common innovations not present in other languages.

If possible give source, dont worry about my tone, Not everyone in the world can talk with  sweet coated words with crocodile tears.

&gt;Obviously you lack reading skills

Not surprised if any one is talking against you, most probably they must be idiots , still neo colonial attitude. good luck with white men burden.


&gt;as i maintained throughout my post that Goans were autonomous and could very well be independent. Not once did i imply it was due to the Portuguese, in fact, i clearly stated that Goans had status in the Portuguese Empire, proof they were regarded as highly capable, intelligent people.

Why on earth did those intelligent people did fought along with Indian against Portuguese? 


&gt;Now what's that got to do with anything being discussed here? I almost feel tempted to reply to you in the same manner and mention something about sanitation and rapes, but that would ultimately be very unfair to all Indians.


When you quote  how macau turned out, i has to point about your country , to make sure earth is not flat.


&gt;I almost feel tempted to reply to you in the same manner and mention something about sanitation and rapes, but that would ultimately be very unfair to all Indians.

NO i am not ashamed of it, coz its the truth. I am not idiot to ask questions for some one and ignore when it comes my part.( And by the way i am curious to check what is per capita rape rate in India to that of European countries )



Last but not least :  I have nothing against you or your country(present not past), Its just when people try to justify moronic things, that world does not exist if not for me/my race i get enraged . (Ok you dint imply anything directly like that, but from being other side of line it feel exactly like  )

A country is no different in essence than a city, a region, or a union of countries (like the EU): it's one more element in a nested hierarchy of political demarcations where people delegate some of their power in order to make common decisions. If the majority of people inside an inner group wants to stop delegating those powers, then they should be able to do so (although, that way, they might stop belonging to the rest of outer groups, and membership should then be re-negotiated).

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Ich vermute wenn ich ein bisschen weiter zurückgehe, finde ich an der Wurzel eines guten Teils des Problems irgendeinen Stellvertreterkonflikt des Kalten Krieges. Bin grad zu faul, das auch tatsächlich rauszusuchen. Insofern könnte man den USA tatsächlich eine Teilschuld geben.

Fühl dich frei dich in die [irakische Geschichte](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irak#Geschichte) einzulesen. Die Probleme sind älter als der Irakkrieg und einen Stellvertreterkrieg gab es nicht.

Und noch was: Wieso vergisst eigentlich ständig jeder die Politik der arabischen Staaten in seinen Überlegungen? Wieso beschränkt sich jeder auf Kolonialismus und Amerika bei der Erklärung der Nahostkonflikte? Dazu unten mehr.

&gt;Stattdessen haben es die USA wunderbar verstanden, dass im Zweifelsfall jetzt alle anwesenden Parteien den Westen im Allgemeinen und die USA im besonderen als Feind sehen.

Das stimmt nicht. Der schiitische [irakische Großajatollah](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_al-Sistani) unterstützte die USA und neue Demokratie und drückt quasi das Gefühl aller Schiiten (60% der Bevölkerung) aus. Die waren erstmal froh nicht mehr reihenweise verfolgt und ermodert zu werden. Aber auch zb seine radikale Homophobie zeugen davon, dass hier immer noch keien demokratische Kultur und Offene Gesellschaft etabliert ist. Aber ich will auch nicht zuviel erwarten.

Also: die USA wird für ihre Fehltritte selbstverständlich kritisiert, aber nicht jeder verteufelt die USA als ultimatives Feindbild. Den USA wird eben durchaus für die Demokratie und anti-terroristischen Bemühungen gedankt. Anders sieht es natürlich bei den diversen vornehmlich sunnitischen Terroristen und Radikalen (zb ehemalige Anhänger Saddams, bzw der Ba'th Partei) die selbstverständlich einen mehr oder weniger ausgeprägten Groll auf Amerika hegen, vor allem nach dem antisunnitischen Kurs des ehemaligen Präsidenten Maliki. Die ISIL/ISIS konnte im Irak auch nur wegen [sunnitischer Unterstützung](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28053496) so schnell Gebietsgewinne verzeichnen. Allerdings scheint sich mittlerweile auch hier wiederrum eine [Konliktlinie](http://www.dw.de/isis-stellt-sunniten-ultimatum/a-17809701) zur ISIS abzuzeichnen. Das wäre im Idealfall ähnlich wie der Zwist zwischen al-Nusra Front und ISIS, vielleicht zerfleischen die sich demnächst noch ein wenig selber.



Leider liest man hier auch nicht so viel von den moderaten [muslimischen Intellektuellen](http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2014-08/islamischer-staat-nahost-diskussion), aber wenn ich das richtig mitbekommen habe zeichnet sich da im Moment im Schatten der ISIS eine Protestwelle ab (insbesondere in säkularen oder allgemein moderateren Oppositionen saudischer oder anderer Staaten), wo die USA und ihr Versprechen der Freiheit gewollt und gebraucht wird:

&gt;&gt;Khashoggi weiter: ""Alle, die von einer ausländischen Verschwörung faseln, verdrängen die Wahrheit und schließen die Augen vor unseren eigenen Fehlern."" Man habe Tyrannei mit Stabilität verwechselt, man habe soziale Verelendung in den Völkern ignoriert, das religiöse Leben sei passiv und inaktiv, Religion diene vor allem der Legitimierung von Macht. Doch niemand wolle eigene Fehler zugeben. Und so ist ""das Einzige, was sich noch dynamisch vorwärts bewegt, die Flut des Extremismus"".

-

&gt; Ich bin gespannt wie lange es dauert, bis wir mit den Kurden die wir grade ausrüsten, wieder Ärger haben. Historisch gesehen kann es maximal 20 Jahre dauern.

Das kann Ich dir sagen: Wenn der Syrien Konflikt zu Ende geht und die Kurden keinen 1A eigenen Staat haben geht das Drama in kleiner Version wieder von vorne los, bzw hört nicht auf.

Deshalb fänd ichs nach dem Konflikt gar nicht mal so schlecht -d.h. sowieso überfällig- die Staatsgrenzen von Irak und Syrien mal ein bisschen an die Ethnien anzupassen, dazu gehört auch die von vielen gehasste Sykes-Picot Linie. Das ist ein Problem das sowieso früher oder später angepackt werden muss. Kurdistan muss auch früher oder später ein richtiger Staat werden. Sie hatten ja jetzt sowieso Autonomie im Irak und waren de facto so gut wie ein eigener Staat, nur eben formal nicht. Vielleicht kann man den ethnischen Kurden in Syrien ein bisschen was von Syrien abschneiden.
