Pas l'article en soi : c'était un premier ouvrage en auto-édition, biographique, pas très bien écrit... le client habituel, pour être honnête. Je rencontre l'auteure, une dame émouvante, qui se sent pas à sa place, qui ne veut pas être prise en photo (« non, s'il vous plaît je ne suis pas belle »), qui hésite sur chacun de ses mots de peur de dire une bêtise. Son livre racontait l'histoire d'une femme de sa famille, réfugiée espagnole qui s'est installée dans la région.

Je fais mon article, et après la parution arrive une chose qui n'est arrivée que trois fois en quatre ans : une lectrice appelle. Elle veut parler avec l'auteure du livre, parce qu'elle aussi est fille de réfugiée espagnole, et que l'article l'a mise en larmes. Et là elle se met à pleurer, et m'explique à quoi ressemblait la vie pour les communistes espagnols sous l'Occupation, comment certains Français les exploitaient, comment sa mère qui avait fui Franco devait faire le ménage à la Gestapo pour survivre etc.

Je les ai mises en contact. L'auteure était contente de parler à une lectrice.

Sweden does that well, even if people claim it discriminates against Swedish nationals. Helping them integrate is better than throwing them to the wolves, like you'd advocate.

So if I understand you correctly. It is better to ensure that the immigrants have jobs than the domestic people? This would mean that we make other loose their livelihood to the benefit of someone else from another country?

How will you find work and a home to everyone coming into the EU illegally and how do you suggest we pay for this?

&gt;Aswell as the Norwegians do, they must work to gain social welfare.

What work do you suggest we give them. We got just hit by the news that 4 million in Spain are without a job. Should we not try to find them jobs within the EU before giving it to others?

&gt;You advocate shooting refugee rafts

Well if you shoot at them they'll stop. If they stop they'll survive. If they drive into the shots fired they decided to... well kill themselves. If someone shoots a warning shot, would you keep on heading towards the same direction or turn around?

&gt;They go there, open up a cafe or so, but only to find the cultures there don't have the same. They end up stuck in a purgatory.

Well then they can go back can't they. Just take ones two legs and start putting one in front of the other. Also what does Spain have to do with illegal immigration form Africa? The discussion isn't about beliefs of wealth or prosperity it's them knowing that what they are doing when hopping on that boat is illegal. If you opt to use a smuggler to get to Europe you know that what you're doing is illegal.

&gt;misinformation and idealism causing these people to die

No what causes them to die is to hop on a boat full of holes in it or if we were to shoot at the boat to drive into the fire. In both cases they can decide to opt out and not try to come here illegally.

&gt;have you ever left your comfortable home in Finland?

Yes I have. I've most likely lived on more countries than you.

They're taking up space, and resources here from the ones that really need our help.

* Short taxi-ride to the beautiful bodega [Parés Baltà](http://www.paresbalta.com). (Make sure to book the visit in advance, tell Silvia that Pär says hi!)
* Taxi-ride back to Vilafranca to visit the wine museum.
* Lunch at [Miquel Soria](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1063738-d4972275-Reviews-Miquel_Soria-Vilafranca_del_Penedes_Catalonia.html)
* Train back to Barcelona

The EU was right to have cancelled these payments. Nobody is holding the EU accountable for the failures of Bulgaria's politicians. And honestly it's really easy to say that from America, a country that has established democratic traditions and a fairly transparent/free-from-corruption government. Corruption is endemic, and it is not going to get solved any time soon, especially since we've only ever had even a semblance of democracy for the last 23 years. Last March Bulgarians protested and ousted the government in power. When the next government came into power and tried to do some sneaky things, the people again protested. Daily. And I believe they still are protesting.

The EU is a positive influence on the country, but the notion that we have received the amount of development funds from the EU that most people claim is wrong - most of our funds have been frozen.

&gt; How will you find work and a home to everyone coming into the EU illegally and how do you suggest we pay for this?

And once more you fail to see my point and try to twist it against me. Once again you try to change my opinion to suit your worldview.

No, I never said that. I said allow them the tools to create a livelihood alongside nationals. Help them find their foot in their new nation. I never at once said we should help immigrants over citizens.

&gt; What work do you suggest we give them. We got just hit by the news that 4 million in Spain are without a job. Should we not try to find them jobs within the EU before giving it to others?

Again, see above. Job creation is not the problem of the Europarliament, but stabilizing the Euro itself is. Job creation is the problem with the nations, and if someone wants to get a job outside their home country, they're welcomed to. If a state won't do it, the people will.

&gt; Well if you shoot at them they'll stop. If they stop they'll survive. If they drive into the shots fired they decided to... well kill themselves. If someone shoots a warning shot, would you keep on heading towards the same direction or turn around?

Oh no, officer! These immigrants ran into my bullets while I was hunting!

&gt; Well then they can go back can't they. Just take ones two legs and start putting one in front of the other. Also what does Spain have to do with illegal immigration form Africa? The discussion isn't about beliefs of wealth or prosperity it's them knowing that what they are doing when hopping on that boat is illegal. If you opt to use a smuggler to get to Europe you know that what you're doing is illegal.

Except when they spent all their money and have no way back? So you just tell them to take a hike and ignore them. What empathy does a person like you give to other people? Absolutely none.

You're again missing the point. They went there in the belief they would make a better life, just like African immigrants to Europe. Yet they come here and find their hopes shattered. Regulating immigration is one thing, and it's another to wantonly kill and maim as many as possible to prove a sadistic point.

&gt; Yes I have. I've most likely lived on more countries than you. I've also worked with refugees in the conflict zones and I know from first hand that the ones that sit on a boat to Europe illegally aren't the ones in most need of help. They're taking up space, and resources here from the ones that really need our help. Hippies like you are the ones that do more damage to these people than the ones that want to stop the illegal immigration flows even if it means taking drastic action. 

Oh, have you? Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

So absolutely anyone that isn't from these refugee zones are clearly up to no good and deserve to be shot? Have you seen these people yourself, or even met one? Europe has plenty of space, but it's the empathy of the people and the decision they want in government that decides their fate. Your decision is obviously morally bankrupt and jingoistic.

Name me the countries you lived in, then. If you believe yourself superior to me in this way, put it on the table. What have you done besides vague talks about living in x and y country, and working in a conflict zone. Name me one zone you've been in.

&gt; Hippies like you are the ones that do more damage to these people than the ones that want to stop the illegal immigration flows even if it means taking drastic action. 

So empathy means I'm a hippie because I don't want to kill innocent people? I'm a man for reforms and comprehension, not to make a fool of myself and my nation on a subreddit. And once more, generalizations and painting me a villain you believe is wrong.

Their ancestors were in the land for centuries, therefore they were Hungarian above anything else.

Modern nation-states depend on the idea that Hungary is for ethnic Hungarians, Slovakia for the Slovaks, Germany for the Germans, etc. etc.

So, despite never having been in the land of Germany, some of my distant relatives were deported from Slovakia and central Hungary because they didn't fit the narrative.

Jobbik isn't trying to get back to those times.

Anyway, these numbers seem to refer to the *state*, not society. In redistributive welfare states, of course immigrants are going to be a net loss if you isolate the cost/benefit analysis to the individual interactions with the state.  

If you measure it this way, *the vast majority of people* are a loss to the state because the state finances roughly hover around being balanced.

Again, try reading the actual posts before commenting. I have already stated the difference earlier in the thread and in the last post.

&gt;these numbers seem to refer to the state, not society.

Of course they do. State finances are what's being harmed in financial terms. 

&gt;If you measure it this way, the vast majority of people are a loss to the state

Nope. In fact the vast majority of Swedes pay well-above what they get back from the state. There is a ton of waste in state resources but it does not largely go back to the citizens paying for it.

&gt;What needs to be taken into account is the contributions made to private enterprise by the growing population, both in generating demand and in supplying labour.

Well that shouldn't be an issue since the government is so desperate to get certain immigrant groups working that they wanted to make their neighbourhoods ""newstart zones"" i.e. no taxation for a period of five years in hopes of getting them to start those companies they so desperately want to back up their claims of it. They had to scrap it once they realized it wouldn't make a difference and be costly as all hell. Getting people from outside the EU into the workmarket at all has been a huge issue for them.

In terms of labour they drive down low skilled labour wages, which is why the second largest political party in the unions are now the anti-immigrant party.

""Convince"", exactly. I don't talk about ""convincing"". That's advocacy, propaganda, public relations. That isn't what is lacking. What is lacking is a bit of research, and people who, even if they may have an agenda, do not necessarily buy their own propaganda. I'm not seeing that. 

EDIT: I'll put it more clearly. This particular discussion started when you claimed that ""international economic agencies"" had found more pros than cons in Catalan independence. So far, you haven't been able to provide such an analysis. Instead you are basically saying ""No, we don't have such independent support, but we have great ads!"".

- major woes in the eurozone re-surfacing
- the eurozone consolidating and enacting legislation designed to harm the city
- the rest of the EU wanting treaty change and the UK not wanting it

Ich glaube, es wird schwierig, sich mit Dir über Politik zu unterhalten.

Aber mal sehen. Bleiben wir doch mal bei einigen Themen aus dem Gespräch: 

1. den Ländern, denen nach der Finanzkrise geholfen wurde, geht es heute wirtschaftlich schlechter. Die Arbeitslosigkeit erdrückt die Gesellschaft und fördert den Zulauf zu extremistischen Parteien. Das einzige, was heute besser aussieht, ist, daß einige Länder sich wieder am freien Markt kapitalisieren können bzw. bald können werden. Aber auch dieser Erfolg ist nur ein Schein, denn sie erfolgt in der Gewissheit der Geldgeber, daß die Steuerzahler - also die Bevölkerung der Mitgliedsländer - das Risiko tragen, nicht hingegen die Banken und Hedgefonds.

2. In der Ostukraine könnten die Voraussetzungen für freie und unabhängige Volksabstimmungen über die Frage zur nationalen Zugehörigkeit geschaffen werden. Dabei geht es nicht um Aufgabe einer ethnischen Identität oder die Unterdrückung einer anderen, sondern nur um die Frage, zu welchem Staat die Leute künftig gehören wollen. Daß das nicht ganz einfach ist, ist offensichtlich, aber eine Mißachtung des Willens der Bewohner ist auf Dauer nirgendwo eine Lösung gewesen.

&gt;The Euro NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme) safety tests are funded by various European governments and motoring bodies. 

Funny enough it costs quite a bit to get cars tested and car makes have to sponsor it all. Most of those are based on other cars that have passed. It's not Audi UK that does the testing so it's probably a mistake after all. This statement makes it look like the testings are state-funded.

The A5 mentioned in the article is just a sportier version of an A4 which does score 5-stars Euro-NCAP. The little difference in upper exterior design and having firmer suspension doesn't affect it's body rigidity by much, if at all. Both cars have the same safety features as standard.

Same goes for the A7, which is based on the A6(5 stars Euro-NCAP) and shares the whole platform. It's a sportier and more luxurios version of the A6 and comes with more safety features as standard. It would definitely pass the 5-star mark.

The A8 is the flagship model, if it doesn't pass it would be a catastrophe. It comes as standard with far more safety features than any of the models that have been tested.

The R8 is a super car based on the Lamborghini Gallardo platform. It's probably got the best body rigidity of the the whole lot. That said, super cars are usually not tested as standard cars because they lack a lot of features in order to boost performance.

When you are there there is a place in the city that has around 50 pichos bars in a 4 block area. People do a ruta de pinchos which is basically bar hopping and each bar has a different pincho. (Pinchos are like tapas) Some pinchos bars only serve one pincho but have a very wide selection in wine.

Speaking of Wine Logrono is the capital city of La Rioja which is the heart of wine making in Spain. You can find lots of wine there for cheap. In June they have the wine battle which everyone goes out of the city and throws wine at each other. I've never been but it looks like a lot of fun!!

It finds that those that receive sanctions (penalties) are more likely to commit crimes again, whilst those that undergo rehabilitation are less likely to commit crimes again, 

Furthermore, they found that when you compare the largest reoffense rate for those that receive rehabilitation and the smallest reoffense rate for those that receive punishment, the ones that are punished still recommit crimes more often. The conclusion is on page 314, second paragraph if you'd like to verify. The results play out in this way in every study they analyzed, which was a considerable number.

In Markup (upon which Reddit comment code is based) every link can have an URL and a title text, separated with a space and the title put in double quotes.

Now your userscript / extension / anything renders title texts assigned to a link to /s as a spoiler.

However, it is essentially only inserting a CSS-snippet which changes the link's color and adds the title to the ""after"" part. However, apparently it adds the title to any link (am I right?) but only colors the background of the links to /s with the same color. This is how it's done in /r/asoiaf for example (except for adding the title to any link).

On a similar sub, /r/gameofthrones however the spoilers are... well, extremely similar, except that the selector for the links to be marked as spoiler is not a[href=""/s""] but a[href=""#s""] (and #b, and #g for other spoilers).

But still, these CSS snippets both work by putting the title text in the link's ::after pseudo-selector, setting its normal color and the link's background color to the same color by default and different on hover.

Normally the link's title shouldn't be visible.

Blaming Islam for this is simplifying at best. People don't just become terrorists because some Imam tells them. It's because religion can give hope, purpose and a future, all of which are hard to come by in our highly individualised world.

1) Now it is the time to look for work. Hotels/hostels are opening and they need workers for the summer (people who works/deal with children, waiters, receptionists, cleaners etc).

2) Be ready to work loooong hours with very short breaks and no/1 only free day.

3) It is not really easy to find a position right now, due to crisis.

4) Most of hotels do not deal well with internet: they prefer to see in person who is handing them the CV.

5) Many hotels where I'm from only work with 2-3 travelling agencies who send them people from 1-2 nationalities. Maybe find a hotel where they mainly got English groups.

My suggestion: I see a lot of people are looking for Italian speaking native English speakers to babysit their children, so they can get familiar with English. Most of the ads are on flyers/newspapers, but I bet you can find something online as well. If not that, a lot of hotels are looking for entertainers and I bet that for the reason above they'd love an English mother tongue.",0,1400095129,null,0,false,0,chhz1ho,t3_25jfqn,t1_chhz1ho,t3_25jfqn,null,1433796331,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

Anyway this is beside the point, I know some of the history of this law and why Scotland didn't go along with the rest of the UK when homosexuality was decriminalized. It was the then Scottish Secretary who decided to block the move for fear of infuriating the powerful Scottish Church, this law was then maintained for the same reason until the 1980s when they felt it was possible to change the law at last (although there was still opposition from some quarters).

Also as any gay man or woman who was around at the time it was still on the books will tell you it does impact on the society. Most homosexuals had to remain under the radar and it helped foster an negative attitude in wider society. Scotland was once a quite homophobic place and this was brought up as part of the debate on same-sex marriage (for example Patrick Harvie the gay leader of the Scottish Greens talked from experience about the attitudes he had to come up against when growing up).

Aneddoto personale.

Sono stato ad una conferenza scientifica che si teneva all'Università di Pechino, e ho avuto modo di conoscere informatici e ingegneri del posto. 

Ci avevano messo le istruzioni per usare la VPN allegate al programma della conferenza. 
Certo, la conferenza era rivolta ad un pubblico internazionale, ma buona parte erano partecipanti cinesi, così come lo staff che organizzava il tutto.
Un giorno eravamo un gruppo di lavoro che dovevamo testare un'applicazione che si usava con la VPN, e il tecnico spiegandoci come si doveva fare ci disse scherzando: ""come avete capito, qui in Cina, la cosa più importante da sapere è come usare una VPN"" (risate generali).

Certo, il contesto era molto particolare: eravamo comunque una comunità internazionale di gente che lavorava nel campo delle nuove tecnologie e avevamo tutti bisogno di accedere, ad esempio, a Google Drive a Youtube e tanta altra roba, quindi non sarebbe stato professionale da parte dell'Università privarci dei nostri strumenti di lavoro; inoltre sarebbe ingenuo pensare che dei dottorandi di informatica non sappiano come bypassare dei blocchi informatici, infine.... quella erano ingegneri! Quale paese avanzato non chiuderebbe in occhio se le migliori teste del paese raggirassero dei blocchi per accedere a maggiori informazioni? Insomma... contesto particolare... ma ci scherzano sopra.

E poi come vi potete immaginare i nerd sono ESATTAMENTE identici in tutto il mondo. Ad esempio: mentre il relatore parlava di massimi sistemi, c'era un ragazzo cinese seduto di fronte a me (eravamo nelle ultime file dell'aula magna) che tranquillo si vedeva il trailer di Iron Man su Youtube.

This group includes myself, with certain restrictions. I'd never use eVoting for national elections, as the risks for abuse grow significantly when there is a lot of power at stake.

Those who are against it are often opposed to the very idea that voting in democracies would be done with a system that is so complex it takes a bunch of PhDs to actually fully understand, design and implement it. The layman has no fucking chance to understand how the system actually works, and why the results are correct.

It definitely is hard - not so much the studies as living on your own so far away from home and dealing with everything yourself. However, I know a lot of international students who are doing much better than me, probably because they actually have social skills. So I guess you'll be fine.

About the language, I don't know anything about your curriculum or your level, but passing a test doesn't always mean you can handle the language when faced with native speakers. I'm not saying you will certainly have problems with this, just an advice to prepare well. Even if you decide not to study here you will have learned a language better.

In terms of cost, I think it should definitely be affordable for an American. I come from a poor European country and haven't had any money issues so far. I live in Munich too, so it's not like it's a cheap city. There is no tuition and the prices are *not* higher for international students. Here we pay 111 euro per semester. Depending on where you decide to study you might have to pay a lot for a room though.

In general, I guess I still can't say if it's worth it, but obviously I believe it is because here I am.

To compare, Cleo was one of the few singers who consistently performed 100% on all her rehearsals. Ruth from Spain, not so much (she has 4 backing singers too by the way). Paula from Romania completely blew one of their runs, and it wasn't just a little bit off pitch - it was the entire climax of the song down the drain. Carl Espen from Norway doesn't sound nearly as good as TV makes you think. The list pretty much goes on and on (don't even get me started on the San Marino chick).

In 2002, the candidate of the Front National also reached the second round but then all the others parties supported his opponent so he was crushed 82% vs 18%. Nowadays, others parties are really divided and its' unlikely they will ally =&gt; it's still unlikely the National Front will win the election because many electors of the ""traditionnal"" parties that didn't reached the second round will still vote against the National Front, but it's not really sure and maybe now that these parties are much more divided, they just won't go to vote and thus Marine le Pen, the leader of the National Front, could become president of France even if the majority of the population don't like her.

Then it's complicated again, because the parliement would still be dominated by the traditionnal parties. The parliementary election comes 1 month after the presidential election. Or she win this election too and she is free to do anything she wants to, or she can't obtain a majority (more likely) and it will be very difficult for her to govern.

It's actually not that difficult if people would actually make use of their right to educate themselves. The reason why many people don't know about this is because national media isn't bringing it to their home via television or radio.    I think it has more to do with the lack of interest of the average citizen in politics.  
The same thing could be said about national institutions.  
Ask a German what the second chamber besides the Bundestag/parliament is. I doubt that they know the name or how it's build.  
Ask an Italian what their perfect bicameralism is. And Italians are generally really interested in politics.   
How many chambers does the EU have?  Nobody is going to tell you that. You need to look it up yourself. It's your duty to actually learn your rights especially if you are living in a democracy where you are the highest instance.    But I totally agree that people should get an easier access to it.  
Also: The Council of Europe has nothing to do with the EU. It sounds confusing but you are correct. 95% wouldn't think that Russia is part of a group that is called ""Council of Europe"" and that it has absolutely nothing to do with the union (even though they share the same flag for some reason).     
While all of your concerns are valid problems I don't see how the EU could solve them itself.  ""More power"" is only going to happen if the members give up their sovereignty to some extend; however this won't happen for obvious reasons.  I already adressed the media coverage but again I don't see how the EU could improve this. Launching a European TV station that broadcasts in 24 (?) different languages could improve this but you can't force people to watch that station rather than BBC, RAI or ARD. They could take an approach like BBC World which is actually a pretty good news channel.  But if the public doesn't care about the EU no national station will give it more coverage.  

&gt;There's a too big influence of the industry

Absolutely. Yet again there are too many interests and a problematic flaw in the current lobby system itself.  While national industries are interested into EU law-making, since they can increase sales in other member states, the other branch of lobbying, unions, are simply not interested in Brussels.  National unions remain national because they only represent national workers who don't work in other countries.   And since job-related laws are still delegated from the EU to the member states they aren't caring about EU laws because often enough they aren't binding to nations.    
A factory worker in Liege isn't going to be interested in Cheese-bacteria regulations concerning Southern France and Italy. That's why this worker's union isn't going to care about Brussels.   
Simply look at the biggest economy's representation in Brussels.  While the German industry federation has a building in Brussels you won't find a huge building of the federation of union workers.  And those guys aren't exactly poor with their filled bank accounts and 6 million members.    
I'm not saying that this excessive lobbying from the industry isn't bad - it certainly is, but I think it's a fundamental problem of the lack of initiative from unions which don't work together.   
Nationally oriented unions have simply a different goals than globally working industries.   This is obviously going to lead to a huge problem in the future and somebody should come up with a good idea to make national unions step up their game. It's weird when the German unions put away a quarter billion each year but won't help out unemployed people across the border because they aren't Germans.

Le rôle d'un trader, c'est pas ""de gagner le plus d'argent possible, n'importe comment, et si tu perds la banque te fais un procès"".

Kerviel a une formation en compta-finance (pas une formation typique de trader, qui est plus matheuse). Il travaillait justement a la surveillance. C'était sans doute un bon employé. Mais il voulait être trader. La banque l'a donc ""promu"" trader junior sur un desk (une équipe de traders, en jargon banquier) avec très peu de risque (""delta one"", je vais expliquer) et ou il ne risquait pas de faire trop de pertes. Notons déjà que c'est un desk de trading situé a Paris, alors que le gros du ""vrai"" trading de SocGen est a Londres.

Le trading que Kerviel faisait, c'est de l'arbitrage ""bête et méchant"" entre actions et dérivés (futures d'indices). C'est une activité par essence avec peu risque de marché. Tu prends une grosse position longue que tu couvre avec une grosse position courte, la position nette est beaucoup plus petite et non-directionnelle (important !) et le risque se limite a la position nette. Il gagne de l'argent avec la position nette.

Le problème, c'est que Kerviel n'égalisait pas les positions longues et courtes. Il cherchait a prendre des grosses positions. Même s'il gagne de l'argent en faisant ca, il est licencié sur le champ et poursuivi en justice car ce n'est pas son métier et cela fait prendre des risques invraisemblables a la banque.

Ce que faisait Kerviel, prendre des positions directionnelles, la SocGen le fait avec d'autres équipes. Des équipes de gestion de biens (asset management), qui sont généralement composées d'un gestionnaire de portefeuille, de plusieurs analystes et d'au moins un trader. Des équipes, donc, avec des gens qualifiés (formations poussées en économie, CFA, etc.) qui travaillent dans un cadre bien défini et surveillé.

Il est absolument improbable que les dirigeants de la banque aient pu penser que Kerviel soit une telle équipe de gestion de portefeuille a lui tout seul. Si ca avait le cas, ils l'auraient muté a Londres dans une telle équipe. Raison pour laquelle Kerviel masquait tout de ses activités.

**Grillo was tapping into the discontent about Italy’s ruling elite that traditional media had largely overlooked. It had been widely assumed that the “Clean Hands” anti-corruption investigations of the 1990s would usher in a new period of good governance in Italy; but what the country got from its “Second Republic” was more of the same, even though many of the leading political figures (including Craxi) had departed the scene. A 2007 book called La Casta (The Caste), by two prominent journalists, fed into the general horror over just how corrupt the Italian political class had become. (Regional governments were revealed to be particularly good at embezzlement.) The message to the electorate was that no matter who they voted for, the thieving among public officials would continue.**

**Opinion remains divided, though, over whether Grillo is of the far left or the far right. His attitude to corruption may be simple enough: no one with a criminal record should be allowed to hold public office. But when it comes to economic policies he is against what he considers to be Italy’s subservience to foreign interests. He believes that the euro — Europe’s common currency — represents Italy’s loss of economic sovereignty, and argues in favour of exiting the currency altogether (and defaulting on debt)**",0,1400110039,null,0,false,0,chi6e8n,t3_25jkqm,t1_chi6e8n,t1_chi5eo4,null,1433799857,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,h33i0,UKGB,London...,"Nice question! I'm very interested to hear about it in other countries as well. I know you're in the UK too, but since there are no comments I thought I would contribute something to maybe help get some discussion going. 


The stand up scene is pretty strong. The local scene is filled with comedy club chains like Glee and Highlight as well as smaller independent comedy clubs. But naturally the largest concentration of independent and chain comedy clubs is in London. Even large cities like Birmingham and Manchester do not have near the same level of concentration of clubs. For most stand ups, it is London or bust. 

A short general description of their career trajectory is once  a standup has a decent set going, one they practised at a clubs (usually in london), they tend to travel across the country at these comedy chains or independent clubs and perfect their material. This usually leads up to the edinburgh festival which is the Mecca of comedy in the UK. Every august, standup comics from across the UK arrive in Edinburgh to showcase the new show they've developed. You tend to find established and upcoming comedians all gathered there. 

After making a name for yourself at the Edinburgh festival the next step is usually going onto radio and TV. The big boys in radio and TV tend to progress past comedy clubs and travel around the country in small theatres and other large venues. They are the ones that are household names and can have very large audiences. Examples would be Peter Kay. 

The main gripe I have with the standup scene is that it is completely dominated by two management companies. Off the Kerb and Avalon. Between them they sign up the best talent, and with their tv production arms (Avalaon TV, Open Mike productions). They end up creating shows simply to showcase their own talent on. Between them they produce a significant amount of stand up comedy programs  or programs featuring stand up comedians in the UK. 

Stewart Lee, another standup comedian described it better as "" You have a ridiculous situation where a client of the management company is interviewing another client of a management company on a programme made by the production company owned by the management company. Basically, advertising money and licence-payer money is being spent to increase the marketplace value of a tiny coterie of people.""

So you get a situation like Alan Carr Chatty Man (Off the Kerb) will be interviewing Adam Hills (Off the Kerb), Jack Dee (Off the Kerb) and Michael Mcintyre (Off the Kerb). 

It's not a complete monopoly as there are many other talent agencies, but its kinda like the la liga, only two guys *really* count (besides this season).

true,Rarehero,EURO,European Union,"&gt;Which clearly shows where the EU's cultural center of gravity is.

If that was the case or a factor, the EU capital would be in France or Germany. Belgium is almost something like a ""neutral ground"" since the country itself isn't very influential in the EU due to its size (and depending on how the country might develop over the next few years or decades Belgium or at least Brussels might in fact become neutral territory). 


&gt;So why would anybody on the periphery of a federal EU tolerate being in—let alone be willing to join—what would essentially be an empire dominated by the Western European nations?

No one thinks of the EU as an empire. It's not like the Roman Empire annexing one country after another. The EU is viewed as an institution that represents and regulates the ongoing process of European integration. It's not a ""All hail our new Western overlords (and abandon our capital)!""-affair.

Plus: The idea of the integration process is to harmonize laws and movement of people, goods and labor between the European countries. And most European countries want to participate in and help to shape that process, and they do so voluntarily. From an imperialistic (but misleading) standpoint you could say that the countries on the periphery of the European countries want to adopt the ""Western culture"" (in reality though it is a ""give and take"" between the members states until there is a solution all partners can live with).

Make no mistakes, it's not like that there are idealistic values. In fact the EU at its basis might all about European ideals. There is a growing ""European identity"", and developing that identity is one major tasks of the EU, but we are far away from being the ""United States of Europe"" (and cheering for other Europeans at the upcoming World Cup, although I will certainly support my Dutch neighbors).

It's a populist political movement that shows an incredibly dangerous disregard for democratic values or the democratic process. Like so many other populist movements, it claims to want to restore the rule of the people, except what they mean is their rule (they don't recognize the legitimacy of any other political party). The leader, Beppe Grillo, enjoys full legal control of the movement's political activities and routinely expells all those critical of his choices.

Aside from the issues of internal democracy (which is virtually non-existent), they have some very dangerous ideas in terms of how to reform the democratic process; currently, their worst idea is that of eliminating parliamentary freedom i.e. the freedom of every member of Parliament to vote even against his party line. Grillo would want it so that in case a MP voted against his party line, the party could choose to recall that MP (effectively turning Parliament into a rubber-stamp office of what the ruling party decides). Since fortunately the Italian Constitution forbids any such mechanism, Grillo has actually forced his candidates for the upcoming election to sign a ""contract"" by which they would theoretically be forced to pay a 250.000€ fine for voting against the party line (this is probably illegal but nobody has brought it to court yet).

You like using the word ""refugee"" because it's sympathetic, but when pressed you refuse to offer any specific definition or proof. Many of these boat people are not under any specific threat, they're economic migrants.

I am not sure why are you bringing up religion in this context.

I don't remember ever being told that religion played part in the conflict, which was mostly about political power with a dash of 'idealist youths' from both sides. This could of course be that we are taught two different histories, but it's also extremely un-PC to insult Islam as practiced by Turks. I went through public education in the south (which is very religious in nature), and I was never told anything against Turkish Islam. Arab Islam, yes. Other branches of Christianity other than Orthodoxy, doubly yes (Orthodoxs hate Catholics way more than they hate Islam). 

And while it's true that Greek Orthodox Cypriots do not have a secular tradition, the 1960 constitution did kinda sorta had secular provisions. Well, more like it was multi-confessional, similar to Lebanon. It wasn't a good system, because it forced you to be either Christian or Muslim, but I am mentioning it to show that Islam wasn't suppressed (atheists and people of any other religion, including the native Maronites and Armenians were suppressed though). 

In any case, if reunification is achieved, secularism on paper is certain, and the Kemalist tradition is strong in the north no need to worry about that. And the state will be a federal one, so no law could be passed to infringe upon the secularism of the north. 

And I am looking forward joining forces with the very vocal secularists of the north, because us secularists in the south are very few, with no political tradition to back us up, and can't do a lot on our own.

Sono giovane, mi sono laureato lo scorso dicembre in *Lingue e culture per la comunicazione internazionale* (tipo Lingue straniere, ma con meno letteratura/linguistica e più economia/scienze politiche). All'università ho studiato cinese per 5 anni.

Molti miei compagni di corso dopo la laurea sono venuti in Cina per studiare meglio la lingua. Io invece ho preferito non seguirli perché in quel genere di corsi ci sono sempre tantissimi italiani/stranieri che inevitabilmente fanno gruppo tra loro e secondo me non entrano molto in contatto con la gente del posto.

Ho scelto di insegnare italiano sia perché mi piace, sia perché mi permette di vivere in Cina in un contesto in cui sono l'unico straniero. Dopo tanti anni di studio in Italia voglio finalmente immergermi in questo paese! 

Detto questo, penso che starò qui a insegnare finché ne avrò voglia, dopodiché tornerò in Italia per cercare un lavoro che mi permetta di tirare su famiglia (come dicevo, insegnare qui mi piace molto, ma non è remunerativo).

Many of these boat people are not under any specific threat, they're economic migrants.

So basically ""I don't know anything about the subject, so I'm just going to listen to the opinion of another guy that knows nothing about the subject and draws a utopian picture"", eh? As to refugees vs economic migrants, asylum seekers put into detention centres in Australia were overwhelmingly (90%+) found to be genuine refugees.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"Based on population, they're about neck and neck. 42% of the EU and 42% of the US population can get a full same-sex marriage. That excludes countries and states where civil unions are legal. 

As far as populations go, they're about the same. The Netherlands was the first country to make same-sex marriage legal, but some US states like Massachusetts were close behind. Right now I'd call it a draw as far as numbers go. 

I think some factors favor the US. Even in the deep south, the Arkansas attorney general came out in support of it (huge step for the south). The Clintons (also from Arkansas) support it. I could see the US Supreme Court striking down any bans/forcing recognition before I could see the ECJ doing the same. 

Overall, the majority of US citizens support same-sex marriage, and opinions seem to have a higher correlation than within Europe. Because of the huge disparity between say the UK, Netherlands, etc. and ex-Eastern Bloc nations I dont see the ECJ deciding that issue and imposing it on all member states. As much as we would like to see courts be non-political there is often some politics intertwined. I dont think the ECB would be willing to decide such a controversial case given the current climate, but that is just a guess, I could be wrong.

But languages are not evenly distributed in the US, and also different states have differen populations. For example, North Dakota (most common language except English: German) has a population of 700,000, while California (most common language except English and Spanish: Tagalog) has a population of 38,000,000. In fact, 1.5 million Filipinos live in California, so it's likely that there are more speakers of Tagalog in California than there are people in North Dakota.

2. Spanish (35 million)
3. Chinese (various dialects, 2.6 million)
4. Tagalog (1.5 million)
5. French (1.3 million)
6. Vietnamese (1.3 million)
7. German (1.1 million)
8. Korean (1 million)
9. Russian (0.9 million)

Also, this is not a final decision. If it works the same as UK, the presiding judge in Spain seeks clarification on a point of law from the ECJ, so that he/she may continue to preside on the case before them. The point of law is now precedence though and must be upheld in other EU jurisdictions.

I cannot really relate to your experience - but should everybody who is seen as not equal by someone else see them as an enemy e.g. people from backwards countries should see the condescending paternalism of people from rich countries as hostile? Should the Roma see me as an enemy? And what about economic inequality? You probably know how incredibly [intersectional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) inequality can be...  Or is it a typically gay thing because gay inequality is worse than the other kinds?

&gt;We want the symbol of marriage, because it is ultimately a public validation of love between two people, and our love deserves that just as much as yours.

This is a bit difficult to understand because I know many straight people who don't see their own marriage the same way. I don't see mine that way. Actually I think if we did not want kids and would not have parents, we could just cohabitate. Many people do that today, many people think ""what is the point in getting that piece of paper"". Our goal was mostly 1) a big thank-you ceremony to our parents, kind of to signalize that we will now stop _being_ kids and starting _making_ them 2) a public commitment and promise that even if the romantic love would one day dissipate we would still keep the vow, keep the public promise and stay and work together for the sake of kids, family. But would not have done it as a public validation of our love becaue we would not feel we need that at all - we would not feel our love is the business of other people at all. Again I cannot relate to the gay experience - it is possible that the general experience of daily prejudice kind of makes that validation more necessary?

It is just confusing. Not sure how to relate to it. Would it be a bit like I would bring a poor rural Roma bride to the family and friends and everybody would go a bit ""WTF?"".",0,1400139924,null,0,false,0,chih7pi,t3_25fyjg,t1_chih7pi,t1_chhx56s,null,1433805090,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

**Bouquins :**

J'ai lu un truc sympa, *[Le linguiste était presque parfait](http://www.monsieurtoussaintlouverture.net/Livres/Carkeet/Linguiste/Linguiste_Carkeet_index.html)* (*Double Negative*, en VO), de David Carkeet. C'est un polar peu commun : ça se passe dans un bureau de linguistes. Pour ceux qui ont fait de la linguistique et/ou qui ont étudié l'acquisition du langage, ça peut être marrant. Ça m'a rappelé les Fred Vargas (que j'avais adoré(e)) avec les trois historiens dégénérés.

J'a trouvé le dernier bouquin de Nicolas Bedos (*[La tête ailleurs](http://www.babelio.com/livres/Bedos-La-tete-ailleurs/541210)*) dans un libraire de seconde main, et j'ai été un poil déçu. J'aurais préféré un livre plus personnel, plutôt qu'un recueil de ses chroniques entrecoupé de petits chapitres sur sa relation avec celle qu'il appelle ""la blonde"". Je l’ai lu a un moment où j’avais besoin de cynisme venant un salopard, donc j’ai bien aimé, mais en rétrospective, sans plus.

D'autres gens l'ont lu ?

**Ciné :**

J’ai enfin vu *[12 Years a Slave](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02Ie8wKKRg)*, très bon film. Django, mais boulversant. Très belle photographie, parfois un peu long mais ça ne m’a pas dérangé outre mesure. Je suis de plus en plus attentif aux belles images, et je n’ai pas été déçu. On comprend pourquoi il sera au programme scolaire aux US.

Je suis allé voir *[Qu’est ce qu’on a fait au bon Dieu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk43HriPEz0)*, et bien que j’ai rigolé (mention spéciale à la Marseillaise), j’ai pas trop aimé. Trop de stéréotypes servis à la louche à nos mirettes. Alors oui, c’est le but du film, mais là on frise l’overdose. Christian Clavier et Chantal Lauby volent la vedette aux autres, mais c’est pas grave, ils sont tous (TOUS !) très mauvais. Je comprends pas le tapage autour de ce film.

J’ai vu *[Jack Ryan : Shadow Recruit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9KAnx4EvaE)*. D’emblée, je préviens : je suis un grand fan des Tom Clancy. C’est pas de la grande littérature, mais c’est un bon péché mignon. Un peu comme Finkielkraut avec la BD. On retrouve son personnage phare, Jack Ryan, qui se fait peau neuve dans un monde dirigé par l’économie. J’ai bien aimé cet hommage aux films d’espionnage de la Guerre Froide – je pense bien sur à *Octobre Rouge* et quelques James Bond, mais aussi à *Gorky Park*, *L’espion venu du froid*, *Le troisième homme*, etc. Quelques grosses libertés par rapport au personnage original, mais c’était quand même cool.

J’ai aussi été voir *[Three Days to Kill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLBnKYDDDq8)*. Bon si vous voulez de l’action, commandez des pizzas et regardez Jack Ryan. Au moins vous serez chez vous et en plus ça sera pas nul.

J’attends *[Boyhood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDztHS3Wos)* avec impatience.

Moins ciné que séries, mais un pote m'a fait découvrir Archer, et c'est super marrant. Juste avant les exams, c'est toujours délicat de découvrir une série dont tout est sur Netflix.

**Musique :**

Pas mal de découvertes.
/u/GolemGorgor m’a fait découvrir Landskapp, grosse claque, je m'en remets toujours pas.

J’ai trouvé une chouette playlist sur Spotify, [Stoner Rock](http://open.spotify.com/user/deadmanspants2/playlist/3EuwifGAra7VpO4FJLEUtD). Ça gueule (parfois), y a des bons riffs (souvent), y a Clutch, Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Truckfighters... que du gros rock avec des poils. C’est cool.

You can already flee the conventional market for Paris. Center of Paris (1st-7th) is a huge no-no, you'd basically need 2500-3000€ of monthly income or very serious guarantees to be even considered.

My advice would be to search for peripheral areas of Paris where you might find something appropriate for such a budget.

Honestly, I don't think it's even remotely reasonable to be considering living within the boundaries of Paris with your budget.

I'm a Belgian historian, I know everything about living near giants. They're only miffed about your alliances if that makes it harder to conquer you when they would like to.

&gt;I'm not sure if you understand the historical and modern situation in the nordic countries when it comes to living near a giant. Western military alliance gaining presence along all of Russias Eastern border, don't you think that would upset them? Consider the Cuban chrisis where USSR tried to get foothold near USA. If you don't know then give it a googlin, opposing superpowers don't want the other one to be too close to themselves.

It's too late for that, they already border and the geographical situation makes Russia and the EU neighbours. Seems it's time for Russia to appease the other power then if they feel so threatened, according to your reasoning.

&gt;That's a whole another subject. 1st they were humiliated on the battlefield, they wanted something to show they infact were succesful in their war against Finland. 2nd Saint Petersburg is 2nd biggest city, and their only Baltic Sea city. HUGE strategic advantages to have a foothold on the Baltic (oil/gas pipelines, trading, military fleet). Securing that by getting a bigger ""buffer zone"" I can understand from a strategic point of view.

There, you have your reason why they would invade.

&gt;Because we can't fight them. Even if we had NATO on our side, a war with Russia on Finnish soil, even if the West was victorious, would leave Finland bombed, potentially nuked/with bioweapon residue around. Would you want that in your country?

How is *not* having a defense alliance discouraging that?

&gt;Even if we'd need it, it wouldn't do much against Russia. As I said, we absolutely cannot compare the military might of Nordics vs Russia. Totally different scale.

There are also the things potential clients of mine will find when they Google my name. I'd prefer that wasn't the case.

I don't see the added value of leaving that shit indexed in google search results, and I for one am looking forward to filing my removal claim.

&gt; This could mean potentially hundreds of millions of removal requests.

Max. about 500 million, I guess.

&gt;  I can guarantee you that this will be exploited, just look at how many DMCA removal requests youtube and others get from labels, rights holders, politicians etc. Many of these are false[1] , but there is no easy way to automate this, while still remaining fair and correct.

Maybe not, but privacy is still worth it. And this law is only for citizens (and corporations aren't citizens in Europe).

&gt; This ruling is proof of a lack of basic knowledge on how the web works

It's not, actually. If they had no 'basic knowledge' they'd be demanding the prime sources to take the material down upon requests. Yet they're asking search engines to remove them from their indexes, which is a whole lot easier and more doable.

&gt; and a complete knee-jerk reaction that won't help the problem at all,

""Knee jerk reaction"". You obviously have no idea how long this case has been debated by the courts and the EU parliament, how much lobbying has gone into this, and how many expert testified on that case. The European Court of Justice doesn't do anything ""knee-jerk"", trust me.

And if this ""doesn't help anything"", there's obviously nothing that could ever help.

&gt; while putting a huge burden on Google

Oh no! Poor huge corporation. If they can't even leave one of the biggest and most profitable corporations on earth alone, then who will ever be at peace?!

1. All EU **countries** pay cash to EU budget - some pay more, some pay less, that depends on their ""richness"". This is agreed upon.
2. Some EU **citizens** get some of the cash back. Citizens in some countries are given more opportunities than others and this is also agreed upon. Notice, that no government received money to distribute it as it wants -- the money comes as part of EU programs and has to be spent accordingly. 

Besides, Polish budget for 2014 is 70 billion €. 82 bln € is cash set for Poland from 2014-2020 EU budget (let's say it's 13,5bln yearly, for the sake of calculation). So, the sum loaned away is: **~0,15%** of Polish yearly budget and **~0,7%** of EU funds yearly value. Not that big of a deal.

So while currently money (at least a chunk of it) actually flows from France to Poland, it is not spent **by** Poland, more like **on** Poland. Also notice that this is only a current situation -- Poland is not some kind of ""eternal beneficiary"" and Poland pays it's share, too. It was just negotiated that more money gets spent on Poland that Poland pay. 

Now, the second thing: the loan Poland's providing. This money doesn't come from the same place as the EU funds. These are funds from Polish budget, set aside for things like that. Yes, if the EU funds weren't flowing in, Poland would probably have to settle for smaller amount, but it's still Polish sovereign decision to loan this money.

I'd say they're on par with Christian pop in the US, but then even those guys have quite a few classics I'm sure...

Yeah it's a joke. And it is at it's most brilliant when the singers treat it as such. Nobody watches it for the music really, at least not in the UK, it's mostly the acts that mater.  The UK gave acts that matched your description for a few years, syrupy, and this year they caught on and gave us pop-revolutionary bird people, which is more in the horrible, magnetic eurotrash style of Eurovision.

And yes, I completely agree here. It's a pan-European version of american christian pop,though a better comparison might be christian country music , and it's kitschy, syrupy and populist. Some of the most like songs this year in fact had the same musical stylings. It is our lowest common denominator. But the fact that our lowest common denominator are things like Wurst or Lordi is somewhat...comforting in a way.

For example, if Poland was not promised substantial funds from the EU it might have not joined at all. Then both France and Poland would hurt, as French products would have a hard time competing with priviledged Polish companies on the vast Polish market. The EU funds for Poland are one side of the transaction that on the other side gave French companies  unlimited access to 40 million consumers. You really don't get to be entitled to the way Poles spend their budget. 

You don't like providing convergence funds and seeing beneficiaries still independent? Remember they could easily embargo the shit out of your company products. But none of us wants that. There are no ""free money"" on the table so don't feel responsible for how they're being spent.

What about if you were to hire a babysitter, and a Google search uncovered that the person has been convicted of child abuse. robbery or whatever? Would you be glad if that info wasn't available?

I don't know what country you're from, but here everyone who want to do a job with kids needs to be able to produce a certificate of ""good behavior and morals in the field of child-related activities""; which is basically a government certificate that you're not a violent person or pedophile. 

And if you're randomly hiring babysitters off the internet, well, then you've got some serious parenting skill problems.


Not to mention that there's absolutely no guarantee that anything on the internet is correct. 

&gt; What if you were to hire a carpenter to fix some stuff in your house? What if they had a fraud conviction associated with their name?

As an accountant, I can assure you there are almost no carpenters *without* (tax) fraud convictions! :)

And that info wouldn't show up on google anyhow.

&gt;Google has no way of determining if this is true or false, at least not on a large scale. Therefore it wouldn't be possible to make this fair in any sense.

That's not the point. The point is that I, and only I, am owner of my information. You have no ""right"" to information about me that I wouldn't want to distribute. And if that information were truly relevant and pertinent, there is a plethora of ways to obtain information about individuals aside from googling them. Therefore it's always fair when a citizen asks for a certain link to be removed from the indexes.

&gt; What about Anders Behring Breivik - that's the maniac who killed a bunch of kids in a summer camp in Norway a few years back. Do his actions have a right to be forgotten as well?

You think those actions would be forgotten without his name returning hits on google? That's not how human and cultural memory works.

Also, most of our lease contracts last 12 or 36 months. For a 12 months lease, you usually have a 1 month notice. If you were to sign a 12 months lease contract, my advice would be to refrain from telling the landlord that you intend to stay for only 5 months, and to give your notice according to the moment you'd want to leave.

On a side note, you're very likely to pay a high amount of money when you move in. If your lease is handled by a real estate agency, you're likely to pay the equivalent of one month of rent as a fee. You'll also have to pay upfront for the first month AND pay a guarantee of one month of rent as a deposit in case you damage anything in the apartment. So, basically, you'll be paying 3 months of rent the day you sign your lease. Be prepared for it.

500-550€/month is very unlikely to be enough to live in a decent place (think &gt; 15m²), except in (very) shady areas. As others have suggested it, I encourage you to contact **immediately** whatever school you'll be studying at, because you're already late for this kind of consideration.

- You quit your job and start looking for a job in another country. Don't get unemployment money in your own country because you aren not looking for a job there. You don't get unemployment money in your target country because you have not worked there. Better save up thousands of €€€, in other words if you are poor and no savings don't try to live in a country where the job market is better!

- Nobody tells you what kind of paperwork you need to fill out (address registration etc.) and it is usually in the local language only. You would expect if the EU is about that you can live anywhere there is some friendly orientation office for people moving over from other EU countries where it is explained - preferably in English or multiple languages what paperwork to fill out? There is usually no such thing. You rely on hearsay.

- Think it makes sense to move with a car? To bring more of your books and  clothes and have a way to get around before you figure out the local public transport? Think again. EU nations are usually super anal about they taxing your car and god forbid that your car would be taxed by another state so you have to go through an incredibly complicated procedure of replacing your licence plate - it is not like you would expect ""yo I want a licence place of this country, here's the cash, gimme!"" it is basically a procedure of importing and licencing a car. It is almost as shitty as if you would be importing some exotic car and licencing it to be road worthy. Ugh.

Three times the rent as net income is indeed a general rule of thumb, and it's enforced by insurance policies that landlords subscribe to in order to make sure that they won't loose any money if you don't pay your rent.

Usually, it's the level of income expected from workers. Students are usually backed by their parents, who, combined, usually greatly exceed three times the rent. Like you said, this is where you having your guarantees back in NZ can become a problem.

By contacting your university, you'll get in touch with services designed to deal with this kind of financial situation. These people will be much more prone to consider your situation as financialy stable since they handle cases like yours all year long without problem.

&gt; Going down the informal subletting road, would I be right in saying that that would require being upfront about the intention to only lease for five months ... but would free me from the more stringent vetting requirements of landlords?

Instead of worthless Bank offshores, we could also setup certain tax havens, with free healthcare, free education and also a place of low cost industrial production. Allow companies to allocate a percentage of their production in those areas, through tax breaks, without exploiting people and giving them rights and better incomes.

Education and training would become a necessity and while at first it could resemble past days of colonialism, most of the profit should be reinvested in those same places and others that would follow. 

If it became slow at first, infrastructure could be a good starter to draw international corporate interest. Build hospitals, schools and universities. Water and drainage. Food crops. All irradiating outwards from those coastal proto-cities.

This is a bit more debatable.  The decision to try and solve all of Afghanistan's problems by making them comply to a westernised system was a stupid plan.  However, an operation had to take place because it is international humanitarian law that civilians should be protected at all times.  Exiting Afghanistan as soon as the first operation had finished would have been a violation of this as you would have left the Afganistani citizens without a government which would have been disastrous.

When Russia had chances of winning the contest with lesbian act t.A.T.u in 2003 there were no complaints from Putin, were there? 

Are the iTunes charts of any importance in Russia? Because the Austrian song is the highest selling Eurovision song at the moment in Russia, [at number 9](http://esctracker.com/), while the Russians own song is at number 41. I can understand why Putin is upset about this chance the people are getting at showing their support to LGBT rights.

I don't like Eurovision becoming political, but if this song can give a voice to people in support of LGBT rights in Russia, I'm all for it. 

&gt;Not that Eurovision was ever about actual quality of music.

The contest hasn't been about quality of music since the mid 1960's. Which is actually why it survived, it's why it's entertaining. A serious music competition won't be watched by 180 million people, or by anyone really. 

I myself am a big Eurovision fan, but it's not because of the music. There's no one I know who watches it just for the songs.

Not to say there haven't been some memorable songs, but I'd say no more than 100 out of the more than thousand songs performed in six decades.

Also if you listen to the winning song this year without looking at the bearded woman, it's actually pretty decent. Not to everyone's taste, but not bad either, and sung incredibly well. Some people like the song only because of the beard, but just as many people immediately dismiss the song the song only because of it.

true,ravingraven,GREE,Greek living in Germany,"It is not that simple.

It would be that simple if the goverment was composed from idependent politicians, but it is not. It is composed from politicans who belong to a party.

Where I come from (a small city in the north) we only elect one MP. Each party just lets one person run (so that it does not split the vote) so you are stuck with one person if you want to vote for X party. You can not say ""I want to vote for the communists but this person is corrupt so I will vote for the other person.)

There were two ruling parties while the corruption was taking place in Greece. New Democracy (ND) and PASOK.

Then the crisis came and we decided that the corruption should go away (why we waited until the crisis to say that will be left as an exercise to the reader.)

What happened then is that [some politicians were imprisoned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akis_Tsochatzopoulos) and [prosecuted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarde_list).

This created the illusion that the two ruling parties (still ND and PASOK, this time as a coalition) were able to cleanse themselves from the inside.

You could ask: ""Why vote for those parties anyway? Maybe you can not vote for another politician, but you can vote for another party.""

The answer is that most Greeks did not have (or thought that they do not have) an option until recently. Until before the crisis the two major parties got more or less over 85% of the vote.

This allowed them to:

* Have huge streams of campaign money (= a lot of votes.)
* Install their people into places of power so that they can ""help"" citizens with their problem (again, in exchange for votes.)
* Have a lot of experience with the governing ""game"" so that other parties were not deemed ""serious"" enough to govern.

Another problem is that most other parties do not align politically with the majority of Greeks.

I could not imagine someone who belongs to the center-right to be willing to vote for the communist party because he knows that the government is corrupt.

Only recently has SYRIZA managed to convince a sizable part of the voter base to vote for it, and this after it has toned down the left part of its political proposals considerably.

Another huge problem is immunity. Even if SYRIZA manages to govern after the next elections, the law protects former office holders. Those laws were voted during the last 20 years from the ND PASOK governments and some people are literally untouchable.",0,1400153699,null,0,false,0,chijgo1,t3_25kquv,t1_chijgo1,t1_chih653,null,1433806150,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

No I don't, because that's completely unrelated and completely not covered by this law, and completely besides the current discussion.

It's not garunteed anywhere in any national ideology or legal framework that you will have access to a job which is high pay and low hours. There's little concrete proof that GMOs are bad for you, and of course you need to pay for utilities, because it costs money to run things. The very fact that you *have* access to GMO food and various utilities means that you're already much better off than a large chunk of the current global population, and better off than pretty much the *entire* historical population.

 &gt; My job is being outsourced, and should I decide to follow it, I have to take a 50% pay cut. 

Or you could get a new job. It sucks, to be sure, but that's how economies work. Progress doesn't hold back just because some people have difficulties adapting. It's hardly a new occurrence. The Luddites for example wanted to destroy automatic textile mills because machines were taking there jobs. Where would the world be if we decided that industrialism was so bad that we didn't bother advancing? I for one don't want to be back in the 1800s. 

&gt; My governments are working at the whim of bankers, paying what could have been healthcare for my father, education for my kids, and a pension for my retirement, to the interest accrued in debt taken out to pay back existing debt. 

You're conflating media talking points with facts. There's not some big banking conspiracy, and any money spent on debt which is a minor part of the budge anyway wouldn't be going to healthcare or education anyway. 

&gt; My parents saw their nest egg decimated following 9/11 (interest rate plummeted), UBS Scandal (Madoff and the sub prime mortgages) and the value of their property fall by almost 75% since 2008

9/11 was an act carried out by outside parties, so you can hardly hold the victim accountable here. As for the whole sub prime mortgage fiasco, the banks definitely should have been held more accountable, but even with that, the loses experienced by many people could largely have been averted if people bothered to read fine print and borrow within their means. A variable rate mortgage is the devil, and no one should touch them. 

&gt; My government also invaded a series of countries, deposed the sitting leaders, and imposed ""freedom"" in the process, they have armed dangerous religious extremists, since they can get results quickly. 

Iraq was wrong, pretty much without question. It was terribly carried out, and based on some really fucking amateur intelligence gathering, with all criticism getting thrown out the window  because the powers at be knew better. Once the US got there and fucked everything up though, there was a feeling of *moral obligation* to stay. Things went to hell because of something *we* did, so we need to at least try and get things on track before heading out. The pullout of Iraq might have been framed as a positive thing to the American people, but at the end of the day it was basically just the US throwing its hands up in the air and saying ""whoops, our bad.""

Afghanistan started out with a better justification, one which most of our allies and the UN supported, but again, the follow through was the problem. The Pentagon grossly underestimated the level of force needed to maintain order in a country like that after you destroy the  government.

&gt; Closer to home, my every move is being monitored, tracked, and cataloged for future scrutiny should the need arise, a complete stripping of my right to privacy, all in the name of security FROM THE SAME EXTREMISTS WE ARE ARMING! 

That's hyperbole in the extreme. The NSA is without question violating civil liberties, but that's a far cry from the 1984 style vision you're describing. Hell, most of the info that's getting picked up is stuff that's already been put out into public consumption. If you don't want people knowing what your facebook status is, you shouldn't have put it on facebook. The wiretapping is a different story, but even that is hamstrung by the sheer volume of data. Still unacceptable, but more for moral and legal reasons than practical ones.

&gt;The WEST is just as corrupt, aggressive, and despotic as Russia. We are the pot calling the kettle black. 

No. This is not the pot calling the kettle black, this is an example of a variation of the golden mean logical fallacy. One side is bad, the other is bad, therefore they are both equally bad. Obviously this is a false equivalency. The west has done things which they should be held accountable for, but the scale is still not the same.

UKIP really do not have glowing admiration for what Putin has done in Ukraine. This is what Farage responded when asked which world leader he most admired:

""As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?""

Personally, I don't think this is how Farage should have answered the question! It is a deliberately (and needlessly) provocative. But that's the type of guy Farage is: provocative and excessively colourful.

However, Farage is obviously distinguishing between Putin's geopolitical brinkmanship (which, however much we dislike him, we should acknowledge) and Putin's politics.

&gt; This seems to conﬁrm that the drafters of the statutes of the ECB have understood the basic asymmetry in the incentives of countries to join the EMU. As a result, they have taken pains to ensure that the ECB, at least on paper, will be an institution akin to the Bundesbank. In fact, the language used by the drafters of the statutes of the ECB is tougher on inﬂation and political independence than the statutes of the Bundesbank. Political independence of the ECB will probably be greater than the one of the Bundesbank. 

As for whether this was a factor in our current troubles, I think most people can plainly see that countries that have different relationships with their central banks (US, Japan, UK, China) than the Eurozone has with the ECB have been much more successful in dealing with the economic crisis.

Those were decisions were made when you were younger and immature; should they now follow you for the rest of your life? 

I would argue no. Some people say they should have known better, and while that's true, everyone did shit when they were kids that they now regret. To have that persist is unreasonable in my opinion. This is a complicated example of technology moving faster than our ability to evolve socially. In the 70s, most mistakes were not documented, so many of our parents could screw-up and not have to relive them.

2. The UK would, and did, get into the European Community as soon as De Gaulle left office. He was only in office for ten years. Yes a lot of change to the European Union happened between 1959-69, but not enough to significantly change the direction of the EU. 

3. +4. Yes. The EU would have been slightly better. The UK is and always has been a core European power. It had a lot to give to the early European project and its goals of post war reconciliation just as much as the rest. Perhaps if we had joined from the start, Euroscepticism wouldn't be quite so much of an 'us and them' scenario as it is now. Instead it might be ""us and us on the continent'. The UK's commitment to free market capitalism has always aided the European project by ensuring that appropriate reforms are initiated and supported. This could have been just as useful in the beginning as it is now and in recent times.

The reason why it's wrong to announce or imply that you hate/dislike blacks, jews or Belgians isn't because they are 'races', which is largely a meaningless term in the first place. The point is that it's wrong to judge or discriminate against a whole section of humanity purely on the basis of your perception of that section, which is invariably coloured by the actions of certain individuals. I don't feel like I really need to explain why racism is wrong anyway, we all (mainly) acknowledge that it is.

The thing that I want to point out is that Gypsies are human beings on an individual level, and it's incredibly harmful to casually bandy around negative stereotypes of entire groups of people. It's deeply dehumanising, and it's no different from all the prejudices through history that have caused, and still cause, so much tragedy.

&gt;è possibile, per te italiano, avere una relazione con unx cinese?

Premetto che sono già impegnato e che dunque non ho cercato una relazione romantica, però la mia impressione è che non sarebbe particolarmente difficile. Ci sono comunque delle cose da tenere in conto:

* La lingua è un'ostacolo. Qui l'inglese non è parlato molto bene, neanche dagli studenti universitari.
* Dovendo fare di tutta l'erba un fascio, ti direi che le ragazze cinesi hanno una visione molto tradizionale se non addirittura puritana di tutto ciò che riguarda la sfera amorosa. Per farti un esempio, le mie studentesse si sono stupite quando gli ho detto che da noi non è considerato strano per una ragazza avere 4-5 fidanzati nella sua vita.
* Sempre generalizzando, le ragazze cinesi vogliono stabilità da un uomo (stabilità &gt; amore), è difficile che si impegnino in una relazione di breve durata. Molto spesso sposano il primo uomo con cui hanno una relazione.

&gt;Hai amici cinesi?

Sì, molti, anche se sono pochi quelli con cui riesco a entrare in profonda affinità. In ogni caso trovo tutti simpatici e gentilissimi ed è impressionante la quantità di gente che attacca bottone con me quando sono in giro.

&gt;Cosa si fa il sabato sera? 

Dipende da dove sei. Nelle grandi città tipo Pechino e Shanghai c'è vita di sera. Qui invece sono in un campus universitario nella periferia di una città secondaria. Fuori dalle mura del campus non c'è niente. Inoltre siamo in periodo di esami, perciò tutti gli studenti studiano fino alle 10 di sera, spesso anche nel week end. Quando esco di sera di solito facciamo una passeggiata nel campus o prendiamo un gelato. Alle 22:30 tutti a casa perché il dormitorio chiude le porte.

&gt;There is much talk of sanctions on Russia. But sanctions can be countered and always ignore a key truth: Russia has always been economically dysfunctional. It has created great empires and defeated Napoleon and Hitler in spite of that. Undermining Russia's economy may be possible, but that does not always undermine Russia's military power. That Soviet military power outlived the economically driven collapse of the Soviet Union confirms this point. And the issue at the moment is military.",0,1400162724,null,0,false,0,chim0rr,t3_25lh2c,t1_chim0rr,t1_chijch9,null,1433807355,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I agree that those were his aims, I just think they were pretty poor ones. 

Western Europe was always going to participate with the USA and forge alliances with one another, in opposition to the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union. US and Western European interests were just too closely aligned for an alliance not to have taken place. With such forgone conclusions, I've never seen the point in resisting them. Why not accept it earlier on and get in on potentially better terms?

I can understand his desire for deeper integration over greater number of participants, but had the UK been included earlier on the UK could have become a member just as integrated with the rest of Europe as German and France are today. There's a much stronger European element to the French and German identity these days than pre-World War. that's because of the almost immediate co-operation between the two states (and others) from the end of the Second World War. The United Kingdom was allowed much time to forge its own post-war identity, focusing on a radical Labour (socialist/progressive-Liberal) government which founded the NHS, the Welfare State and started dismantling the Empire. When France and German were establishing their post war selves their new identities became intertwined with the creation of the Coal and Steel Community, EuroAtom, the Common Market and all the rest. The UK could have developed this identity much like the rest did. People think that the UK is an island and has always seen itself that way. Well France is not an island but saw itself similar to how the UK sees itself, but that changed with the post-war peace settlement.
