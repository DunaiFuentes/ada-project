Breaking (or ""creatively interpreting"") the law and circumventing supervision is about the worst a secret service in a democratic society can possibly do, IMHO. I accept the necessity of *some* surveillance, but it's in conflict with other fundamental rights, so a balance has to be found. I also accept the necessity of *some* secrecy, but it's in conflict with the transparency that is necessary for the electorate to make an informed decision. We have a small body of parliamentary representatives that have been given privileged insight into those secrets to ensure the services stay within the boundaries of the law that we have agreed on to balance security vs. privacy. 

Another group that we have entrusted with making decisions in secret in our behalf are the agents of the intelligence services. We give them access to our communications to ensure our safety, on the precondition that they remain within the limits we set them.  

I don't doubt they had our best interests in mind when they decided to ignore those restrictions and the precondition of oversight, but they simply weren't authorized to make such a decision. To the contrary. This is a violation of the trust that forms the basis of the agreement. It's a clear sign that they, on an individual level, don't have the necessary personality traits to be entrusted with the access they have, and that the mechanisms for oversight are insufficient on an organizational level. They weren't doing a ""better job"", because their job is not primarily to ensure our safety, but to protect the very principles of our society that they had violated when they went beyond their privileges and evaded supervision.  
Such actions erode the trust in the state and disenfranchises the people, and unless they will have serious consequences, assurances that our fundamental rights will only be restricted to a necessary and transparently agreed on degree will be met with cynicism and suspicion.",0,1412439174,null,0,false,0,cl09com,t3_2i9oa1,t1_cl09com,t1_cl05pl6,null,1426687401,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

Exactly. We have enough resources to provide everyone with a good standard of living, it's just that in our current capitalist system resources are distributed vertically upwards because that's where the money flows. 

Especially as automation increases and companies don't need to hire as many people, a bigger share of the revenue end up with the company shareholders. Most of whom are wealthy people, hedgefunds etc.

The added effect is that the consumer base is shrinking as well, which actually incentivizes companies to fire more people, get more unpaid labor (interns), lower wages or simply automate jobs when it becomes economically viable as technology advances. This is called a feedback loop.

Obviously this is not sustainable if you want to maintain a healthy and stable society.

&gt; It's different when it comes to things that have limited resources and are physical objects that you cannot copy for free

Air and sunlight are free, they are the two most vital physical resources we have.

Through technology we can make the rest of our necessities abundant. In fact, in many ways we already have, but what we don't have is a good way to distribute the resources so that everyone has at least their basics covered to an acceptable standard. The capitalist system is great at stimulating growth in consumption, but it's not very good at other things.

And I am not sure where you came up with communism. I'm not suggesting classic communism, in fact I don't even know exactly what system would be the best but just like we can go from riding horses to driving cars to flying airplanes, we can improve our socioeconomic systems.

C'est pas du tout pretentieux, les acteurs sont tres bons (l'acteur qui joue le maire jour le bourre tellement bien qu'on peut se demander si c'est pas de la vraie vodka dans leurs fioles). On rigole  par moments et les dialogues sont tres bons et les images tres belles aussi. 

Le lendemain je suis alle voir Lucy et aller voir ca le lendemain ou on a vu le film qui a rafle le prix du scenario a cannes ca rend le contraste encore plus fort...

J'ai trouve le film vraiment nul a chier pour le coup. Ce que je trouve bon dedans ce sont les images de la nature + les images de synthese de notre univers etc. A part ca les dialogues je les ai trouves super mauvais.

Morgan Freeman c'est un robinet a debiter des conneries a sonorite scientifique. Dans le style je repousse les limites de mon cerveau j'avais largement prefere Limitless qui n'essayait pas de rentrer dans le cote scientifique bidon et cherchait juste a faire un bon divertissement.

Et non je ne m'attendais pas a un truc extraordinaire et je sais que des gens peuvent aller au cine juste pour se divertir mais il y a des films sans pretention qui divertissent un maximum sans non plus etre totalement cons.

I didn't say that, and that's obviously not true. Or, it depends on what you mean by ""good standard"". Economy is not a zero-sum game, you take from some, you give to others and everybody is happy. If you take from some and give it to others if the system is not longer efficient you might share a much smaller pie and the ""others"" will get to have even less then they had before.

&gt;automation increases

It doesn't increase by itself, somebody needs to plan and work on that. In your society where everybody will be almost equal and work will be done for fun, it simply won't be incentive for people to do hard work and making robots and automating things is hard work, it also requires a lot of resources. Efficient resource allocation is a thing that you cannot solve without free market, once you have a free market you don't have communism, they are kind of mutually exclusive. 

&gt; Through technology

Again, technology doesn't grow in trees. While some people might write some free software when they please, I haven't heard of people making CPUs in their free time and building semiconductors factories out of their piggy bank money. I doubt people would build cars only for fun, it's one thing if one person re-builds a Mustang in a year for fun and it's another thing when a factory makes 100,000 cars a year. You can't have that if people work only for fun, even with all the robotization.

You take things for granted: robots, technology, free time of programmers, etc. All of these would not exist at their current levels without an efficient allocation done by free markets. (or at least more efficient than any other system) 

&gt; in fact I don't even know exactly what system would be the best 
&gt;...

&gt; we can improve our socioeconomic systems. 

I agree, you don't know, I don't know either. ""communism"" is just a label, just as ""capitalism"" is. Tell me what you want to do and how you want to achieve, equality, fairness, etc and I can judge if that makes sense or not, till then we discuss fuzzy concepts that mean close to nothing. 

I also agree we should work to improve the socioeconomic system, but you improve it by using good ideas, not ideas that actually harm the economy. If you base whatever improvement you want to make on less free market and free economic decisions for the people you'll not succeed to improve anything.   
 
I haven't heard of any idea that comes from communism promoters that convinces me that free market can be replaced by anything more efficient or that people would retain their economic freedoms in whatever system communist propose. If you have economic freedom: to do whatever you want with your time and effort, it becomes capitalism. If you restrict these freedoms then you can have equality, but not a very efficient one, everybody will be equally poor. Even poorer than they were in capitalism.

false,[deleted],null,null,"I have dealt with these UE people almost daily for years. Some are okey, some are straight up nazis about anything. It is up to you to make sure to adapt and make sure you are as nazi with your work as they will be themselves.

The funding programme they used is not specified in the article but in most programmes you spend money and then you send the proofs of what you do and how much it costs you and the UE reimburses 50% of it. It can be salaries, ad inserts, car rental, hotel, fees to book a venue etc... as long as it is part of the funded project half will generally be paid by the UE (there are a few exceptions but the UE tells you about them beforehand so you know they will entirely be paid by you and plan your budget accordingly).

When they receive the invoices they look upon every single one (sometimes there are 250 invoices to analyse) to make sure everything is okey. If they find something that is not satisfactory as in our example generally they contact you and ask more info about it, if they are satisfied with your answer they pay it with the others, if they think it is still not good they just say ""no, we won't pay for this particular item"". When they are finished they pay you for everything they accepted as a spending respecting the contract you have signed with them. 

In OP's example it is not really clear but I see four possibilities :

The total cost of the insert at fault was 66 000 € and Europe refused to pay their half, meaning the organism has not been reimbursed of the half it expected to see reimbursed potentially making them in trouble if they a bit short on their liquid assets. Highly unlikely as even on several millions euro projects I have never seen an ad in a paper costing 66 000 €

The insert cost was 33 000 € and the journalists did not understand that UE only reimbursed half. Not very likely too, 33 000 €  is still a huge amount for that kind of insert. 

They worked with another funding programme that worked differently but I have never heard of a programme where they cancel a 33 000 € grant on just one small mistake, on programmes where you are given a certain amount to achieve a certain goal and are not paid on the justification of your actual costs, if they spot a mistake they generally just substract a pro rata of the final grant according to the gravity of the mistake. So still pretty unlikely.

The last one I see is they somehow fucked up on all their inserts. It is possible if the PR person made the visual style for all the inserts and published material once and for all and fucked up on the size of the flags, resulting on every single ad and published item having the flag mistake on them. On a big project I can see 66 000 € being the whole PR budget for the year, it is still pretty big but depending of the size of the organism it is possible. It would then indeed result on 33 000 € worth of grant being cancelled. It is the more likely case scenario in my opinion but once again without more info I would not be able to say for sure. :)

For example not having a central government that wants to meddle into our language and education systems. Or having a government that actually represents the (very different) political will of Catalunya. Instead of the (totally backwards IMO) of the rest of Spain. See election results. 

PP is the third or fourth force in here. It won general elections in Spain several times. It is a clearly anticalanist party. Says it all, really.

The referendum got the support of ~920 out of 940 municipalities. Quite impressive me thinks.

This is the very reason we don't want the rest of Spain to vote on this. You have this strange view that we are money hungry. We tried to go the Estatut way. The central government laughed at us and now it's probably too late for that. We have been dialoguing and asking for more competences for decades. 

The central government is the number 1 responsible for this. They fed this movement until we are now majority.

Évite de dire des trucs de ce genre, c'est extrêmement condescendant, ça rabaisse ton interlocuteur, et ça ne fait pas avancer le débat, tout au contraire.

&gt;Déjà j'ai du mal à comprendre comment on peut éduquer ses enfants de telle manière qu'ils puissent croire en une religion.

Une excellente éducation serait une éducation qui permette à l'enfant de pouvoir analyser de manière critique, de manière nuancée, des problèmes, qui soient tout autant personnels qu'extérieurs. Cela n'implique pas que l'enfant termine croyant à une religion, tout au contraire, si c'est le cas, il est endoctriné, on doit être capable de changer de position et de croyance.
Ceci s'applique aussi pour des parents croyants, leur enfant doit être capable de devenir athée, de devenir hindou, de rester dans la religion de ses parents. Il faut laisser de la liberté aux enfants, mais leurs donner les moyens de l'exercer d'une manière réfléchie. 
Ça, c'est une excellente éducation, une bonne éducation, c'est de faire de l'enfant une personne assumée, qui se sente bien dans sa peau (ce qui est compris dans l'excellente éducation). Une mauvaise éducation, c'est de rendre incapable l'enfant de changer d'avis.

It's probably due to a combination of changing attitudes about sexuality throughout the Western world, as well as more progressive attitudes among young people.

The next big change came near the end of the famous ""Purple Cabinet"", named after the mix of red (Labour party) and blue (two Liberal parties).

&gt;In your society where everybody will be almost equal and work will be done for fun

My society? Now you're just putting words in my mouth. I said people do things with their lives for other reasons than money. It has also been shown that increasing salaries for people doing creative work, like programming, art or whatever requires you to use your brain, does not increase their productivity, in fact sometimes it decreases it.

Income inequality is very low in Scandinavian countries, and they are among the best places to live in the world, with the highest living standards, least amount of poverty etc.

&gt;Efficient resource allocation is a thing that you cannot solve without free market

Except you probably can. The free market is horribly inefficient at allocating resources.

&gt;I haven't heard of people making CPUs in their free time and building semiconductors factories out of their piggy bank money.

Wow, just wow. It's like you are ignoring everything I'm saying.

&gt;You take things for granted: robots, technology, free time of programmers, etc. All of these would not exist at their current levels without an efficient allocation done by free markets.

They probably could though.

&gt;If you have economic freedom: to do whatever you want with your time and effort, it becomes capitalism.

Capitalism has only one inherent incentive, to acquire profit. That's essentially an incentive for greed. Now if you combine greed with absolute freedom and absolute power, the result is not always very good, as we are seeing in the world today in terms of income inequality and increasing social unrest, environmental degradation due to pollution, irreversible climate change etc.

The free market has been productive for a long time but now we're starting to see diminishing returns in the form of these environmental and social problems that are so big that it's difficult for people to even comprehend their scale and seriousness.

Not really.  No one got polio, the article says that the risk was low, and most Belgians are vaccinated against it.  I can see why someone might be dismissive, but industrial accidents should always be taken seriously, because the next one might be worse.

Likewise, I didn't have to go down into immense details to interpret his comment as dismissive.  It's obviously and extremely dismissive.

My comments don't sound dumb or offensive, even after re-reading them; I feel no regret about telling someone off for posting a dismissive comment about a dangerous pathogen getting released into a river.  The guy I responded to shouldn't have made a stupid remark that minimized the importance of protecting the public from a terrible disease.  I've studied polio and know what it can do.

In case you hadn't noticed, Canada and the EU signed CETA - much like NAFTA in North America, but with an even deeper economic integration.

Canada has closer ties with Britain than with the US.

&gt; Do you think that Canada wants to alienate it's largest military &amp; economic partner for Europe?

Most of Europe is part of NATO, along with Canada.  Little would change.

As for economic partners, Canada has been distancing itself from the US as fast as it can for the last decade, signing free trade agreements with many other countries.

It's not just the US's runaway debt problem; it's that both parties use it only as a political football and refuse to deal with it.  It's not just America's recent industry-wide mortgage fraud turned industry-wide investment fraud.  Or that those responsible went unpunished.  It's that they were left in charge, and successfully lobbied (bribed) congress to stop laws that would stop them from doing it again.  No, Canada does not want to be tied to a sinking ship.

From lumber to wheat to trucking to lumber to manufactured goods, the US increasingly simply ignores its NAFTA obligations.  Why would CANADA worry about alienating the US by seeking more reliable trading partners?

Nor could Canada join an EU-style North American Union.  The EU has several major powers, and many smaller ones who can band together. North America on the other hand would be dominated by the US's economy and population. To avoid ""the tyranny of the majority"", Canada would REQUIRE an equal say in monetary, economic and other policy. This in turn would be unfair to Americans. It won't happen.

a) ce l'ho io e va bene (ah!) pic related, è la mia [Petomobile](http://i.imgur.com/jPYfztb.jpg)

b) è talmente lenta che è impossibile andare a velocità superiori a 130km/h senza aver prima fatto richiesta in carta bollata ai pistoni

c) consuma come un'assassina quindi ti obbliga a andare a velocità moderate e senza pigiare l'acceleratore a meno che non vuoi sentire tutti i suoi 7km/L sul portafoglio

d) se ne trovano usate anche con bassi chilometraggi perché tipicamente auto da vecchio

e) è molto spaziosa per quanto piccola sia ed è discretamente comoda anche da usare in autostrada per molte ore

f) le versioni UP dal 96 al 98 non hanno NIENTE (no aria condizionata, servo sterzo, abs, vetri elettrici, fendinebbia, radio, airbag). Gli optional sono vernice metallizzata e le 5 porte. Se hai culo anche il motore.

g) Il motore D7F è un 1149cc da 59hp, la macchina pesa quasi na tonnellata quindi sei ben al di sotto della soglia per i neopatentati

It probably does among the russian community and beyond you are just not there to feel it , as many of western news sites , that might be the result of the propaganda we're talking about but they think the same about you so that's a dead end.

The point is that if you wanna be politically unbiased yourself then you gotta read all source of news , i doubt you can read any anti-western news like the one they have at RT.

It's about balance , right now Russia is the one which has the power to oppose the Western-dominance and their politics. Western media is not that unbiased when it comes to foreign politics such as the Middle East or Ukraine . They need some opposition hence Russian media .

Without wanting to confuse you too much, but you know how we use the word ""duck"" to refer to both ducks *and* drakes, when technically only the females are ducks? Or ""dog"" to refer to both dogs *and* bitches?

Same in German, for most animals. There is usually a male version and a female version, but to refer to the animals in a general way (if their sexes are unknown or unimportant), usually one of the versions is sort of the ""default"" version.

For example:

* der Hund = the (male) dog
* die Hündin = the bitch

* der Kater = the tomcat
* die Katze = the (female) cat

The words you learned for dogs and cats in general will have been ""der Hund"" and ""die Katze"", and those are the words usually used in general conversation.

This is true in many, many other cases as well:

* der Mäuserich = the male mouse
* die Maus = the female mouse, or ""the mouse"" in general

* der Bär = the bear, both male and general
* die Bärin = the she-bear

In a few cases, there's a male and a female, and then a generic term which is often neuter:

* der Hengst = the stallion
* die Stute = the mare
* das Pferd = the horse

So the logic is there: in most cases, there is actually a male and a female version, and you pick one to talk about the generic animal. We do very much the same in English, but since grammatical gender isn't marked with different articles and adjectival endings, it's not obvious.",0,1412455626,null,0,false,0,cl0gc9n,t3_2iarae,t1_cl0gc9n,t1_cl0fjp2,null,1426683981,6,false,German,t5_2qq51,6

Also, see *Roe v. Wade*, abortions are legal in the US as well. In fact, they are more accessible in the US than in parts of the EU. Your list only magnifies your inherent bias, acting as if joining the EU would not have similar culture shocks that you point out (albeit incorrect).

Canada and the US will not form a union. It would be unpopular on both sides of the border. Given trade is very liberalized, there would be no incentive to piss off both groups of citizenry.

Le piège de la source. :S bah ça m'a obligé a beaucoup chercher. Et il faut dire que j'ai pas trouver grand choses retraçant l'évolution du taux d’accès aux marché niveau bac. J'ai cependant trouvé ceci :

http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/fporsoc08d.pdf

""Au cours du XIXe  siècle, les effectifs annuels de bacheliers restent constamment inférieurs à 10 000, seuil qui ne sera franchi que dans les années 1920, la proportion de jeunes bacheliers passant alors de 1 à 2 %. La progression reste encore modérée, mais un peu plus forte au lendemain de la seconde guerre mondiale : 30 000 lauréats vers 1950 (5 % de bacheliers) puis 60 000 en 1960 (11 %), date à partir de laquelle les choses vont s’accélérer."" p26

En prenant en compte que seulement 5% des jeunes obtenait le diplôme en 1950 et 11% en 1960, et le besoin de main d'oeuvre ""qualifiée"" c'est pas très compliqué de conclure qu'il était plus facile d'obtenir un travail avec le bac... Le point commun de tout ce que j'ai lu est que le Bac était à cet époque un diplôme bourgeois et élitiste, ce qui va souvent de pair avec une facilité à trouver du travail. ( surtout à l'époque)

Pour mettre en miroir avec aujourd'hui, un Master n'est pas spécialement vu comme un diplôme élitiste, il faudrait donc comparé aux grandes écoles, qui représente l'élite. Avec un diplôme de grande école, aucun problème pour être embaucher, un peu plus si tu veux un gros salaire, mais ça reste un problème de riche.

**Note the trend.**  America's share of trade with Canada has dropped considerably over the last decade.  Canada's trade with all the countries it's signed free trade agreements with over the last few years is just getting started.  And now its just signed a free trade - and more - agreement with the EU.

There's growing Chinese and European investment in Canada's oil and other industries.

The US will always be a large trading partner for other countries.  But the days of it dominating their trade are disappearing.

Again, that's also largely because of US policies.

&gt; Who shares the largest border with Canada and has the most developed intra-country infrastructure with Canada;

Sticking with NATO and trading with the EU does not change this.

&gt; Wait...so...how is Canada more entwined with Britain in a practical sense &amp; **how is America a sinking ship compared to Europe?**

That's an easy one.

**Canada:**

20 years ago Canada, like the US, each year piled an ever larger deficit onto its ever growing national debt.  But then it tightened its belt managed to end the deficits, and used small surpluses to pay down its debt.  And so when the 2008 recession hit, it was in a far better position to weather the storm.

The key here is that it tightened its belt when times were good, when the economy was strong.  And so it hurt a lot less.

Unlike the US, also didn't deregulate its banks.  Outright fraud remained illegal.  And so no banks had to be nationalized or bailed out.

**Europe:**

Most European countries were also piling deficit after deficit onto their debt.  And that made things far worse when the 2008 recession hit.

And so now they tightening their belt.  But it hurt a lot more since they had to do it when economic times were already bad.

**But they're doing it.**  The EU had rules such that any country joining had to have its economic house in order.  They just got a harsh lesson in what happens when they ignore those rules.  And they're fixing the problem.

**The US:**

The US is **still** piling ever larger deficits on it's national debt.  With no end in sight.  They're not even fixing it when times are good.  (Statistically, we're closer to the next recession than the last one.)

Those responsible for industry-wide mortgage fraud turned industry-wide investment fraud and collapsed the economy, were given bonuses for a job well done.  They were left in charge.  They lobbied (bribed) Congress to ensure that no laws would be enacted to stop them from doing it again.  Can you guess what happens next?

When you hear that US national debt is $14 trillion, well, it's the American way of calculating the debt.  It doesn't include unfunded liabilities like public pensions, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which retiring baby boomers will soon be drawing on in large numbers.

That doesn't include the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars after they end. Many soldiers who would have been killed in earlier wars have thankfully been saved. But this means that a great many veterans have survived with brain injuries, lost limbs, etc. Some estimates have the long-term costs of treating them being even greater than the costs of fighting the wars.

By most estimates the bills that will be arriving in Washington for the next few decades will total more than a hundred trillion dollars - several times the size of the entire American economy. America will hit the debt wall like a bug hitting a windshield, far worse than Europe.  If by chance you're under 30 - and stuck with the bill - you're probably blissfully ignorant of just how totally and thoroughly screwed you are.

If you had to tie your finances to someone else, who would you pick?  The person who had been overspending, but finally realized the problem and is spending less....  Or the person still ignoring the problem, still racking up more and more debt, and insists that their new car and new big screen TV shows that they don't have a problem?

Canada is choosing the former.  THAT is why it's been signing free trade deals with other countries as fast as it can, and inviting investment from China and others as fast as it can.

And BTW, if you don't know how Canada is entwined with Britain, you REALLY don't understand the situation.  Canada is still a member of the Commonwealth.  It has much the same military ties to Britain as to the US.

I do agree. These are good alternatives when it comes to classical banking. Spain suffers of many workers and people that have had their accounts for many years, and maybe refuse to go because they got a few ""gifts"" such as dishes and other crap.

&gt; The animosity may not go away, but the Palestinians could accept defeat on Israeli terms. They've lost. If they admitted it, they'd have sovereignty.

This is not (nor has it ever been) how humans work. Waiting for Palestinians to admit defeat as your solution is as stupid as declaring war on the concept of terror.

It is *not* a solution because there's no situation in which it can credibly happen.

&gt; Since they don't, the conflict will continue until the Israelis get fed up and do exactly what the Croatians, the Poles, and the Czechs have done with their revanchist minorities: get rid of them.

Outright ethnic cleansing will deprive Israel of what support it still has. If your solution is ethnic cleansing, you might want to rethink a few things.

But there *is* an inevitable conclusion to this, though. As more and more land gets taken, the two-state solution becomes impossible. So if Israel doesn't want to genocide the shit out of people, there's only two options left; enfranchise the Arabs in their land, or keep them disenfranchised. The former makes Arabs outnumber Jews and ends with the collapse and dismantlement of the only Jewish nation-state. The latter is apartheid, which also ended in the collapse of the last state to try it.

Entiendo tu opinión, lo ideal sería reformar la constitución y seguir el proceso de acuerdo con la legislación española. Pero debes entender que en la última década todos los intentos que ha hecho el gobierno catalán para cambiar la situación en Cataluña (estatut, concierto económico, independencia...) han sido rechazados de forma inapelable y bastante cuestionable por el gobierno español (el estatut fue aprobado en Cataluña, recortado en Madrid y al final el tribunal constitucional directamente se lo cargo... y esto con el PSOE en el gobierno, que teóricamente está más dispuesto a negociar que el PP). No solo no se ha conseguido avanzar ni un milímetro, si no que vamos hacia atrás. El PP ha intentado cargarse la ley de inmersión lingüística que tan bien funciona en las escuelas catalanas, y algunos ministros incluso han amenazado con suspender la autonomía. Ante esta situación parece absolutamente imposible que Cataluña consiga hacer un referendum con el beneplácito de Madrid. ¿Qué hacemos entonces? ¿Qué opciones hay? Si te lo planteas honestamente sabes perfectamente que España nunca va a permitir un cambio en la constitución que permita el referendum, la única alternativa es hacer las cosas por nuestra cuenta. Y eso sin tener en cuenta que el derecho de autodeterminación está en la carta de las naciones unidas y es uno de los derechos humanos (http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho_de_autodeterminaci%C3%B3n), te recuerdo que la legislación internacional está por encima de la constitución.

&gt; Greed is a human trait. You can make a society that's not based on incentives if you talk about a society of robots, it won't work for people, they need incentive and punishment, carrots and sticks, to do anything that's hard to do. 

Every trait is a human trait. Of course people need incentives, nowhere did I say we should get rid of incentives. Again with the words in my mouth, wtf.

Incentivizing greed may not be the best way to drive people, as it produces mixed results. 

Perhaps there are other types of behavior that could be incentivized, that produce better results.

* Das 3x zielfernrohr ist bei Temperaturen um den Gefrierpunkt beschlagen, obwohl Hensoldt das Visier als Allwetter tauglich anpreist. 

* Der Arretierknopf für die Schulterstütze bricht in der Mitte durch bei Temperaturen unter 0, weil er aus billigeren Plastik gefertigt ist als der Rest. Dadurch wird die Schulterstütze unbrauchbar weil sie beim Schuss wegklappt. 

* Der Verschluss friert am Gehäuse fest und muss mit Gewalt nach hinten gerissen werden. Magazine sind ebenfalls sehr spröde und gehen schnell kaputt. 

*  Es gab Manöverpatronen (Platzpatronen) aus Plastik, die sich  beim Schuss in tausend Teile zerlegt haben. Die Fragmente haben dann den Verschlusskopf und das Patronenlager so verstopft, dass teilweise nach einem Schuss die Waffe unbrauchbar war und komplett gereinigt werden musste. Natürlich wurden diese Patronen erst nach langem hick hack ersetzt weil eine Packung ein Drittel von den Messing Manöverpatronen gekostet haben.

Yes, I can. The U.S. organized and backed the entire operation. Those ""war crimes if they stayed"" were simply never going to happen with the U.S. closely watching the Croatian government.

&gt; Although MPRI's core business involves military advice and training, some commentators credited MPRI for the success of the Croat offensive, Operation Storm, which soundly defeated Serb forces holding Krajina in August 1995. the company first gained its reputation with a major project in Croatia, beginning in September 1994. With the explicit consent of the US State and Defense Departments, the firm undertook to modernize and retrain the command structure of the Croatian national army, including the general staff. In the summer of 1995, with such assistance, the formerly inept Croatian army mounted Operation Storm, a successful summer offensive into the region of the Krajina. In less than a month they ejected Serb-supported forces and 150,000 Croatian Serb civilians with remarkably little bloodshed. Control of the region, long held by the Serbs, returned to Zagreb. According to observers, the Croat forces used typical American combined-arms tactics, including integrated air, artillery, and infantry movements, as well as maneuver warfare targeted against Serbian command, control, and communication systems. 

http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/ops/croatia.htm

&gt;Operation Storm was a well-coordinated offensive against the Serbs in
the Krajina region in August 1995. This large-scale, sophisticated operation collapsed Serbian defenses within a week, resulting in the recapture of the region.
The operation was characterized by US-style combined-arms maneuver warfare
targeted against Serbian operational centers of gravity.

Also, you should know that education is much less flexible in Spain than in the USA, and almost entirely focused on test scores. You are given certain career choices (science, humanities, etc...) but aside from that classes are predetermined and you need to pass all of them to graduate. And when you apply to an academic degree (here you don't apply to a university in general but to study something specific) your grades are all that matter. You are not asked for essays or interviews, it's all much simpler: if there are X places to study something, the X people with the higher scores get them. Therefore, extracurricular activities are the exception, not the norm. Most schools are usually underfunded and understaffed to carry on with the general curriculum as it is. Some teachers do find time to set a theatre play, or give extra classes, or maybe train a soccer team, but it's nothing like your clubs and bands and Friday Night Lights stuff.

As for the environment, if your high schools are actually anything like in the movies you should find ours much more laid back. Spain is not culturally as competitive as the USA.

From what I know of nowadays high schools they are not that big on computers, and if they have computers they'll be used only for some specific lectures related to them. Libraries are usually small and not many people visits them (there are many public libraries you could rather visit if you just want to go there to study). 

As the comment above mentioned there are not that many choices regarding the classes you want, for me (about 10 years ago) I could choose either science or humanities, and science would force me to choose one between: economy, biology, technical drawing. On top of that I was able to choose between computer science or German, but there were no more subjects I could choose myself (the rest were Spanish, Maths, Chemistry, Physics, PE, English and I think that's it). I don't know exactly how this works now but I bet it's not all that different from back then.

The schools might be a bit crowded, again depending on which area and which school you're going to.

Regarding extracurricular activities in my school there were many different sport teams (basketball and football/soccer being the most famous, but also hockey and other stuff). But this all really depends on the school.

When I was studying a girl from Australia came to study to our school, she didn't speak spanish but still she managed to make friends and was pretty popular (I guess being a hot australian blonde also helped) so I guess that should be alright. If you can speak spanish though or if you're going to an english-speaking school then you should have it easier. Also the english teacher will love having you around to teach everyone how to speak proper english.

David Lee Roth did something similar in the 80s when he was with Van Halen. His tour group had a huge rider about what each venue must have in detail, what safety mechanisms and wiring had to be in place (because they had a crazy number of stage effects for the time, and improper setup was incredibly dangerous), what food should be put out, etc.

One of the items buried in this rider was ""Bowl of M&amp;Ms backstage, with all brown M&amp;Ms removed"". When this became public, people took this to mean that the group was stuck up and were just being assholes so they could pamper themselves. But it was really a signaling system. They had a problem with venues being so eager to sign them to perform that they didn't really read the rider, which could be a deadly mistake. They put that specific item in there to make sure that the venue actually read the contract and complied with it. If they went backstage before the show and saw brown M&amp;Ms, they would immediately put everything on hold so a safety check could be done.

So while the logo issue seems minor, it's really an indicator of how the project will be run in general. If they are already skirting incredibly simple specifications like a logo size, then it's unlikely that they are going to do the project the proper way.

That is interesting. The majority of Irish people are against abortion on demand, but a large majority are for access to abortion on health grounds or for rape. 

To show my biases, I am pro gay marriage and adoption and also against abortion on demand. I suppose you could say that i have the mainstream position on both social issues. I regard it as killing a human being. Religion doesn't come into the debate, aside from the usual fringe groups.

 I don't believe that being pro-life in Ireland has much to do with religion. Ireland is about as irreligious as any other Northern/Western European country. If Irish people were really pro-life on religious grounds, then it wouldn't make sense that 85% believe that homosexuality is morally acceptable. 

Abortion in other countries has been legal for a long time. It's just become one of a number of issues like discrimination, the environment etc. that marks one as being liberal/on the centre or left of the spectrum. I doubt that abortion is a national debate.  It's just one of a number of things that you believe if you are progressive. 

In Ireland, abortion is, and has been for some time, up for debate and at the forefront of peoples' minds. Being pro-life is acceptable, indeed it's the mainstream position. It's even a normal (though minority) position for someone on the left. The labour party and the Green Party do not have policies on abortion. Many of their members would be pro-life. A member of parliament for Sinn Fein, the major left wing party, voted against legalising abortion in the case of suicide recently (a minority position in Ireland btw), but he has been left back into the party. It's simply acceptable to be against abortion here.

I'd say (maybe my biases are showing) that if abortion became a live issue  in other countries, an issue that is at the forefront of debate, the number of pro-life people would increase, though not become a majority.

Mais tout le problème, justement, pourquoi faudrait-il caser tous les programmes de toutes ces chaines dans une même grille ? Qui décide ?

Avant que la télé n'existe, les ""pauvres"" (vague notion, un pauvre, c'est celui qui est exempté de redevance ? mais passons), les pauvres, donc,  lisaient le journal par exemple. Mais admettons que certains ""services publics audiovisuels"" soient considérés essentiels et indispensables [rires], comme disons, l'information et deux ou trois programmes pédagogiques et culturels, pourquoi pas un divertissement ou deux. Si on vire les merdes comme les séries diverses et (a)variées, la météo en boucle 10 fois par jour en quintuple exemplaires, les jeux débiles et autres émissions pourries où un mauvais chanteur de karaoké assassine la chanson française en direct, apologie décomplexée de la médiocrité la plus crasse devant des millions de gens, de bonne foi on ne fera croire à personne qu'on ne peut pas caser l'essentiel dans une unique chaine publique.

La redevance est un abonnement obligatoire et par définition un sacrifice, aussi minime soit-il, de liberté. Dans le doute, le minimum syndical est souhaitable. Ensuite si l'état dans sa grande omnipotence, veut caser dans ses grilles plus d'émissions de qualité ""supérieure"" au privé, il peut toujours le faire sur des chaines payantes.


Mais passons sur les opinions politiques qu'on ne partage pas. Ce qui me dérange le plus, c'est que le peuple n'a aucun contre-pouvoir là dessus. Il n'y a aucune démocratie directe ou indirecte face à l'embonpoint de ce ""service public"". Je m'explique : jusqu'à maintenant, si on ne voulait pas de ces programmes il suffisait de ne pas avoir de téléviseur. Les raisons ne manquent pas: trouver que c'est trop cher, que les programmes sont médiocres, pas à notre gout, les infos trop superficielles ou trop orientées et tant d'autres raisons d'ordre privé, aussi diverses que d'avoir simplement autre chose à faire, ou de ne pas parler français.

En cas d'augmentation des prix, de baisse de qualité de programmes, de période de crise, les gens pouvaient voter avec leur porte-monnaie : la télé ne me convient plus, je me débarrasse de mon poste et je ne paye plus la redevance. Aux chaines publiques d'assainir leurs finances, d'améliorer la qualité des programmes.

Whether you like it or not, or want to admit it or not, making Switzerland or Norway the 51st state would alienate the European Union *(or at least it's leadership)*.

&gt;Just, uh, get rid of your awful politicians first and reform your democratic system to be less plutocratic and more democratic.

More democratic than the EU Commission &amp; Council? More democratic than a European Parliament which lacks legislative initiative? Less corrupt than Italy, Spain &amp; Hungary? 

Or do you mean more democratic &amp; less plutocratic in the sense of having a monarchy? You know, when you pay to entrench a single family in the upper crust of your society &amp; give them frequent contact with the upper echelons of your government? How about when it's accompanied with Upper Houses like in the United Kingdom &amp; Canada, where Lords/Senators consist of life appointments, life peers, hereditary peers &amp; spiritual peers?

Mostly I agree with you, I really do, but I hate the implication that America is so bad it couldn't join now if it wanted as people are proposing with Canada. I'll be the first to admit things need to change in America, but we're not exactly at the bottom of the barrel like the picture many posters here are trying to paint. 

Personally however I think the West would be stronger with a consolidated European Union &amp; united North American Union working together instead of a overextended European Union &amp; divided North America with a wedge driven between them because of such a scenario.

false,FlickMyKeane,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; It's my understanding that Ireland is still strongly anti-abortion

Certain sectors of Irish society would be strongly anti-abortion but not the whole country. [Public opinion has been broadly supportive of abortion legislation to be introduced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#Public_opinion). 

There is still a sizable enough conservative movement with a lot of clout behind them however in Ireland and they begin their sabre rattling whenever the issue comes to a head. Take last year's *Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill* which allowed for an abortion when a women's life is in danger, including the risk of suicide. It received [strong public support](http://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-ireland-rape-fatal-foetal-abnormality-771180-Jan2013/) but the [conservative brigade and the church still managed to stage mass demonstrations against it](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/50000-join-march-in-protest-at-abortion-law-29401009.html).

Even more pertinently, five TDs (Members of parliament) from the main Government party Fine Gael voted against the bill and were expelled from the parliamentary party because of that. A large chunk of Fine Gael's voting base would be opposed to abortion legislation and, because there's an election in less than a year and a half, they don't want to push the issue again and put through more expansive abortion legislation as it would risk splitting their party. Party politics getting in the way of democratic will. I know, shock.

If the issue went to a referendum I would wager it would pass. Perhaps not as comprehensively as the polls would suggest as people who are more inclined to be anti-abortion (Old and rural, basically) are also more inclined to actually vote but the sizable urban and less-sizable-though-in-this-case-it-might-be-more-sizable-due-to-the-liberal-issue-at-hand youth vote should push it through.

When 50.1 % of the vote makes a country go independent it is the majority completely overruling the minority and unlike a conventional election they cannot file a reverse campaign afterwards.

I said should. As in 'there is no good reason for them to be upset'.

&gt;More democratic than the EU Commission &amp; Council? More democratic than a European Parliament which lacks legislative initiative? Less corrupt than Italy, Spain &amp; Hungary? 

We aren't actually a European nation state. And yes, those three are problems, but doesn't mean we want more problems in the union just for the hell of it.

&gt;Or do you mean more democratic in the sense of having a monarchy? You know, when you pay to entrench a single family in the upper crust of your society &amp; give them frequent contact with the upper echelons of your government? 

Ever heard of a constitutional monarchy? The only function the queen has, in my nation, is to sign the laws, guard the democracy and represent the nation. The monarchy is an excellent marketing tool and is not a detriment the democracy.

&gt;but I hate the implication that America is so bad it couldn't join now if it wanted as people are proposing with Canada. I'll be the first to admit things need to change in America, but we're not exactly at the bottom of the barrel like the picture many posters here are trying to paint. 

You need to get over your national pride then. The thing is that the US is an extremely powerful block to just put into the union, and if that big block is dysfunctional? Yeah, then we'll have a fuckton of problems in Europe as well all of a sudden. I don't want that to happen, thus the cautious approach. Canada is different due to its size and that's just how it is. If the US integrated on a state-by-state basis then it would probably be better and easier to join.

false,Toppo,FINL,Finland,"I think a great shift in Finland happened around the turn of the millennium. But I don't think Finland was that homophobic to begin with when compared to several other countries. Sure, things have been shitty everywhere, but I think the Lutheran history of Finland made Finns softer than in say, catholic or orthodox cultures. Lutheran religion in general does not strongly dictate the private lives of people, so matters like sex and relationships aren't a huge interest for the church. Marriage isn't even a sacrament of our Lutheran state church. And as the church has had an effect on the culture, our culture also has been slightly more indifferent towards homosexuality than many other countries. I would assume Lutheran religion is a factor also with other Nordic countries.

In Finland, homosexual acts were decriminalized in 1971 (and ironically they also decriminalized sex with animals in 1971, as long as the animal does not suffer). Homosexuality was declassified as an illness in 1981. But the downside with the decriminalization in 1971 was a new law that criminalized ""encouragement to homosexual sex"", which was a compromise with the conservatives. In practice this law caused self-censorship in media on accepting homosexuality, as no one wanted to be sued.

The law criminalizing ""encouragement to homosexual sex"" was removed in 1999. After this the media started to be more open about handling homosexuality. Same sex civil partnerships came legal in 2001. After that the public opinion on homosexuality has had a big shift. I would even dare to claim that in the 90's our Parliament was more progressive than our citizens, but during the 21st century the shift has been so big that now the citizens are more progressive than our Parliament.

Now days the majority of Finns support same sex marriage and equal adoption rights for same sex couples, but the Parliament is still struggling to legalize them. The citizen initiative for same sex marriage legislation has been the largest initiative in Finland, collecting twice the amount of needed signatures in one day (the amount needed is 50 000 signatures during 6 months, the initiative got about 100 000 signatures in about 24 hours).

How I see is that the public opinion changed in response to the changes in legislation in 1999 and 2001. When the state declared that same sex couples have the right for civil partnership and freedom to speech applies to talking about homosexual acts also, it sent a message to the people that maybe gays aren't that bad. The more legal equality people have, the less people can base their prejudice on law. And as people cannot base their prejudice on law, a lot of people start thinking that maybe there was no reason for prejudice to begin with. And even the homophobic attitudes have changed. Rarely do homophobes in Finland deny the right for civil partnership from gays, even though they would oppose equal marriage rights. Even majority of the homophobes seem accept that same sex couples have the right to civil partnerships.

In addition to all this, also the general western attitudes and culture, especially in the 90's have had an influence in my opinion.",0,1412468640,null,0,false,0,cl0lqit,t3_2i9rc3,t1_cl0lqit,t3_2i9rc3,null,1426681463,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

IMO as a UE citizen you should be able to open an account with little trouble.

From my experience as a young user is that one thing you must never do is to have a negative balance. Not even for one day. Always be sure that when you receive one invoice (mobile phone or whatever it is) you have enough money to cover an extra cost. You will be hardly punished for being late in most banks.

false,Toppo,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I do still have doubts about the overrepresentation of homosexuality in media, it became a fad for a bit to have a queer character everywhere and to be honest that got on my nerves.

Two points I would like to make:

1. Any tiny minority that has had major trouble being accepted is deemed to be overrepresented in the media. If you think that like, 2% of people are gay, it is such a small minority that if you make 2% of characters gay, you end up having no gay characters at all. A Soap opera or a reality show with 20 characters to be statistically representative, there would not be any gay characters. And if every show does this, none of the shows ends up having gays. Several TV shows acknowledge this, and include gays not to be statistically representative, but to show that *we don't exclude homosexuality*.
2. Majority of the homosexual characters are written by straight people. That's the reason the homosexuals often stereotypical queen gays: that's what homosexuality brings to mind for many people, and they write it out / seek reality tv contestants ""who are like gays"". Many gay people are annoyed that the defining aspect of gay characters in TV is their sexuality.

Nor a bad one. Only the people themselves can decide that.

&gt; Also, you are completely wrong in your idea of what democarcy is.

Then you clearly have a very different understanding of the term than me.

For me, democracy is about a group deciding together what's the best course of action. Many decisions allow for a middle ground to be reached, and democracy can work that out just fine through pacts between voting groups. However, when a decision is binary and no middle ground can be reached, the democratic course of action is to follow the will of the majority, because it's either that or a minority overruling a majority.

&gt; When 50.1 % of the vote makes a country go independent it is the majority completely overruling the minority and unlike a conventional election they cannot file a reverse campaign afterwards.

With the alternative being a 49.9% overruling the will of the 51.1%. And you are wrong, independence can be reversed the same way that it can be enacted: if the majority wants so, and the other country wants the region back, a reunification vote can be made. Compare that to your idea of democracy, where certain decisions you don't like plainly can't be made even if the majority of the population wants so.

&gt; Independence referendums are inherently UNdemocratic.

A referendum with universal suffrage can NEVER be undemocratic, no matter what it is about. It can be many things, and we may like its topic or not, but it's democracy in its purest form: it's the whole population deciding their course together, directly and without middlemen.",0,1412469536,null,0,false,0,cl0m40y,t3_2i9sp9,t1_cl0m40y,t1_cl0kcp6,null,1426681289,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

false,ultimomono,null,null,"Since you call it high school, I'll assume you are from the US or somewhere with a similar system. My son goes to a public high school (high school--instituto--goes from age 12-18 in Spain). One of the first things to know is that there is much less difference in Spain between one high school and another--things are more equal funding and curriculum-wise than in the US. That said, you won't find high schools (or universities, for that matter) with mind-blowing facilities and amenities--things are simpler here. Much more low tech, but I'm not entirely sure that's a bad thing.

My son's school in Madrid has computers at every desk in the classroom. They aren't fancy at all, but they can look stuff up on the internet and do online coursework and tests via an ""aula virtual."" He's in a bilingual program where half of his classes are in French, the rest are in Spanish and he can study another language (he does German). He loves it. 80% of his teachers are top notch. But we're big nerds who do a lot of intellectual stuff at home to fill in the gaps.

These kinds of bilingual programs are optional, but if you go into one, you tend to be with students who are willing to work a bit harder, because they involve a few extra hours of school a week. It's a sort of informal way of stratifying things (for better or worse).

If you are fluent, I don't recommend studying English in the public schools here, unless you want a very easy class. It was absolutely excrutiating for my son (who has grown up in Spain, but has two English-speaking parents at home). He couldn't wait to get out of it. The level is very, very low. 

There are so many other differences--for example, all of the kids in a ""grupo"" take mostly the same classes for the first few years and stick together from year to year. There's much less choice in the classes you take--the general level is higher than it would be in the US for many subjects and it's not at all uncommon to fail a class and have to retake exams in June or September (you get a few chances) or even repeat a grade. The last two years (age 17 and 18--the bachillerato) are not obligatory and a lot of kids drop out at age 16.

Schools have some extracurricular activities, but nothing like you would find in a US high school. Sports tend to be organized in leagues that are not associated with schools at all and even stuff like theater, art, or music tend to take place in cultural centers or conservatories (some of which are public or subsidized).

(For what it's worth, my husband teaches at a very expensive private school in Madrid and we could send our son to school there for free... and we choose not to. It's clear to us that quality of the education is not better there and we see other benefits to being in a more economically and culturally diverse setting close to where we live.)",0,1412474458,null,0,false,0,cl0o3p4,t3_2iaupk,t1_cl0o3p4,t3_2iaupk,null,1426680301,8,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,8

One minute we have to find suppliers who are not fracturing E.U., the next minute a wild ""Portugal"" appears out of nowhere just because I have some flag next to my username. Way to shift the focus of the issue at hand when it becomes less convenient. Sorry for the rudeness but yeah, way to be a dick, Jim.

My country, when talking about energy imports, is E.U.. Not Portugal. Portugal doesn't have shit to do with Algeria, nor Spain has for that matter. It's EU. There's no sovereignty when energy is concerned. I should know. I'm here!

Same thing goes to Algeria. The company that supplies us with gas is the same that supplies oil is the same subsidiary owned by the govt that is an OPEC member which is a [cartel](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cartel).

Implying decisions are made on any lower level than that is a bit naive of you.

And still, aren't we talking about gas here? 
The main gas imports are up north, Algeria is a non issue, they cannot produce more than they already are. It's a dead end. Production has stabilized and started falling. Just by that they're not an option to go to when we need to ""get better suppliers"" as you suggested. 

And they are not an answer to my question, not by any chance. As I said, do they not pressure E.U. with prices? Yeah...they do, they're part of a cartel. The pressure they exert is deliberate and coordinated. One day is gas crisis, the other is petrol..and so on. (EDIT: this is in Portugal. Just before you start minimizing the issue like this is not ""trading as a weapon"". I must insist. To see where this is weaponized we have to look at it at the E.U. vs OPEC scale. It's all geopolitic shenanigans from there.)

Every energy company uses trade as a weapon. That's my point. The ones who don't, are taken over.


Btw...you could have said Norway and you had a better argument than that...but you had to pick on the Portugal thing didn't you? Damn internet, I just want to have a straight forward conversation without all this bickering shit.

Xénophobe potentiellement oui (ils peuvent tendance à avoir peur de l'étranger mais après quelques mots échangés, ça change très vite. Beaucoup n'ont jamais eu l'occasion de discuter avec des étrangers). Raciste non pas vraiment. Nationaliste... peut etre par moments, mais rien de bien méchant. Ils sont globalement fiers d'etre japonais et de leur culture, mais ils vont pas aller se dire ""on est mieux que vous"", jamais, bien au contraire en fait.  
Bien sur faut pas prendre les Zaitokukai comme exemple de la société japonaise non plus. Et c'est peut etre eux qui t'ont laissé penser que le Japon était nationaliste. Ces mecs là tout le monde les deteste et sont une toute petite minorité.

&gt;Peut-être qu'ils ne pensent rien des juifs en particuliers, mais beaucoup ont ce genre de pensées sur les chinois par exemple, même s'ils ne le diront jamais à un étranger.

Sur les chinois oui. Et t'inquiete qu'ils le disent aux étrangers. Mais en meme temps les chinois en face sont 1000x pires à ce niveau. C'est pas une situation évidente la relation chine-japon-corée. Ce qui est sur, c'est que c'est absolument rien en comparaison au racisme général en France. J'ai pas souvenir d'un chinois poignardé par un jap juste parce qu'il était chinois dans les news si tu vois ce que je veux dire. Par contre en Chine eux ils brulent les voitures Japonaises et attaquent les business tenus par des japonais.

&gt;Plus globalement, quelqu'un d'une race différente restera toujours un étranger, il n'y a pas vraiment moyen de s'intégrer. 

Oui et non. Il faut definir ""s'integrer"". Je suis bien mieux loti au Japon en tant que Français que si j'etais Arabe en France. Je connais tout le monde dans mon quartier, les gens me disent bonjour, je suis accepté partout, j'ai bien souvent un salaire supérieur aux japonais, et j'en passe. Mais je suis blanc bien sur, donc oui dans un groupe de japonais je ressors plus que les autres. Et? En quoi c'est anormal? Je n'ai pas à me transformer en Japonais. C'est pas anormal dans une société aussi homogène. C'est un fait qu'il faut accepter (et en général c'est plus d'avantages que d'inconvénients).

&gt;Ce n'est pas du racisme violent du style ratonnades, mais cela reste du racisme. 

C'est mon point. C'est _rien_ comparé à la France. Et ils gardent souvent pour eux leurs pensées plutot que d'aller les cracher sur les autres (du moins dans le cas des japs, les coréens peuvent etre un peu plus virulents envers les japonais). Globalement les gens ne parlent pas de ça. J'ai rencontré sur 2 ans 2 japonais au total qui m'ont dit qu'ils n'aimaient pas les coréens. Tout les autres étaient des gens super ouverts qui voulaient voyager et étaient très interessés par les cultures autres que la leur.

&gt;Je me plains de cela en Chine juste au-dessus, mais je connais des gens qui me disent que c'est encore plus fort au Japon.

Si c'est des chinois qui te disent ça.. =)  
Honnetement, si quelqu'un te dit que le Japon est raciste il n'a aucune idée de quoi il parle et n'a jamais vu ce que c'etait que du racisme réel. Mais c'est très courant chez les étrangers qui passent du temps au Japon et aiment se plaindre (e.g ""- la place était vide près de mon siege dans le metro!"", sacrée parano, ""- Ya des pancartes avec marqué foreigner forbidden!"", ah oui dans certains brothels très interessant..)

That's an incredibly illogical way to vote. That's essentially saying that you should vote against your own interests, and hope that allows the party to catch on in the long term.

The best option isn't either of these paths--it's to push for electoral reform, and push hard.

No it doesn't stand for Turkish nationalist party - it stands for [Movement for Rights and Freedoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms), and while the majority of its members are ethnic Turks, the party's statute does not mention the term [turk or turkish even once](http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=761564) most likely because the Bulgarian constitution bans parties formed on an ethnic basis. In fact there are quite a few ethnic Bulgarians and Roma in the party.  And while there are segments of the Bulgaria population that revile DPS, the party is certainly not in isolation - it has been participating as a coalition partner almost in every single government since the fall of communism.

In the short term, support for Israel from the West might be reduced or cut off, but in the medium and long term, Israel would be rid of a violent, revanchist minority and Israeli political life would be able to function more normally instead of being either directly or indirectly centered on the Palestinian issue.

I don't think the Israelis *should* expel the Palestinians, but if they did, I would not see that as irrational.

It started with the Cold War obviously, where Berlin was *the* hotspot for spying. The US and the West German gov formed pretty close ties in the intel community, and many agents became friends or shared mutual respect. 

This continued after reunification of course, into the present day. What the German government gets is reciprocal intel sharing. The US spies on German citizens and then hands that info over to the German gov, since directly spying on their own citizens would be against the law. German leaders use this primarily to track neo-Nazi members and other groups that they deem dangerous or harmful. The US in return gets the same intel on the Germans, plus alternative intel from the German intel sphere, mostly concerning terrorism. 

There's a reason that most of the cooked intel for the Iraq war was fed through the German -&gt; US intel channel - they work closely together and can do each other favors. 

So yes, if you are German you should be pissed at your government for literally selling you out daily while pretending to hold themselves to a higher standard.

Define deterent? Because if you compare the equipent used be the west it is mostly offensive, regular people don't even do military service, while the sectarians only really fight each other, because they are to underpowered, this has been the case for almost all of history, the big guys have offensive weapons and peacefy the ""foreign threats"". Nobody supports a invasion per se, but give them a moral reason and people will support it.

Also as a FIY, a guerilla defense is very cheap to set up, organise and run(beside the swiss and fins I don't think any other country trains it's people defensively), a militaristic build up however only defends to current goverment, not the people that finance it. 

Most cases where small countries got invaded, they lost the war(army got crushed, goverment got deposed), the only countries that survived, survived by grass roots opposition.

Not necessarily. It depends on the English skills of the teachers and the quality of the education system in general.

There may be perfectly adequate Russian English teachers in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but outside developed areas there will be people teaching English by giving the kids a textbook with an answer key and telling them to get on with it because they have negligible English skills, yet there is literally no one else available to teach the course.

The EU was made to maintain peace on the European continent and if we reduce that down to its essence then it was made to maintain peace. Nothing in its mission statement says it must be placed on the European continent forever and to reduce it to just that is silly.

&gt;The UN, albeit with many failures, already works as a global supranational entity, and what you propose would fit better in the UN or in a reformed UN-like entity.

No, it really does not. The UN will never unite humanity. Our single best shot is to do one step at a time through the EU.

&gt;I think that was one of the main points at the moment of its inception.

Doubt it and even if it was true then it does not mean it's not senseless to restrict the EU to just Europe.

But what you forget is that there are traditionally 4 macro castes or *varnas*, with the Dalits being the 'outcastes' and not included in the system. When you compare Dalits with their 'higher' castes, you are including weavers, tailors, craftsmen classes, etc etc as being higher that them. Most of whom are very disadvantaged themselves (As were my parents, grandparents, etc) A flawed comparison for very obvious reasons.

It would be more correct to say that good education was restricted to the ruling classes, Brahmins, and merchants. But even that only much before independence. 

While Dalits are still left out of most social and economical growth, education to the others, including the other lower classes has actually become *very* equitable and widespread and it's happening at a rapid rate.

Though the obvious suspects among the governors of the ECB certainly haven't helped. But even that's not blocking actions, thx to majority voting and rotation, as much as legal uncertainty over the extent of its mandate when it comes to unconventional policies. OMT case will be a fascinating test thereof, and QE be almost impossible (barring acute and intense manifest political danger), until that is clearly answered.

To put it concretely, if an EU QE didn't entail explicitly buying up sovereign debt of Italy and the like (say due to having either paneuropean debt or more substantial private debt markets), politically spinable for domestic consumption in the north, it would have happened when it economically should have, couple of years ago. Just like it did in the US, UK etc.

Then the only thing needed would be to establish treaties between these larger unions.

I find somewhat ethnocentric to believe it has to be Europe (or ""the West"") who takes charge of ""uniting the world in peace"", as if the rest of peoples that make this planet were unable to do it by their own means. They could use the EU as an example and as a model, but they need to use their own tools as well.

The UN as it stands today is a farce. It can be reformed though. It can be the entity that unites all the other supranational entities together.

Public executions, not mass. The same policy exists in saudi arabia and under sadam hussein the number of executions where more common.

&gt;They are a threat to the whole region.

They are a threat to their people. Demanding concesions, is more beneficial than bombing them along side their people.

&gt;Even Sunni governments in the region are attacking them. 

Their decision, they have direct etnic and political interests interests in that.(Saudi arabia risks a uprising if they fight them to openly and Iran risks a uprissing if they don't fight them). We have no right to arbitrate.

&gt;They are not a government. They are a roving band of war criminals that delight in chopping innocent people's heads off.

Goverment does not need to be civil.(Saudi arabia or even the US if we consider Guantanamo style bases)

&gt;The countries in the region are asking USA for help.

SO is literally every country that is not at war with the US.

&gt;You say perpetual war, but Afghanistan wouldn't have had a war if they weren't harboring Bin Laden and letting him and his associates use the country for a base for hiding and training as honored guests.

Do you hear what you are saying: A enemy of your country isn't instantly extradited, so that is reason for you to invade that country. That is a level of arrogance only a imperialist country has over it's subordinates. Furthermore IS the US goverment responsible for everything that the people within it's borders do?(I sure hope not because that would be very totalitarian)

&gt;You just see USA involved in something and automatically they are the evil imperialists? 

No, I see the trend of US foreign policy for the last 200 years and call it imperialist. You have never been neutral.

&gt;What did you think was going to happen after 9-11? 

COnsidering it was the US, a military solution was pretty obvious, I am suprised by the restraint following the boston attack, but Chechenia is already invaded by the russians.

Oh we lose people in car accidents too, no big deal?

Actually it is a big deal, you just make cars safer instead of banning them. Overreaction is only done when there are strategic benefits.

&gt;I'm not going to defend Iraq.

I actually understand strategically Iraq, keeping it together with a puppet government, was however retarded, but offending turkey was just a price to big to pay. Afganistan was part of that bigger picture of keeping an eye on Pakistan and Iran. Strategically it was smart, the execution was tipical american bluntness. I get that, from the UN, but when it's basically a US unilateral policy, I can't back that up. And hearing your retarded claims that Osama was there therefor you should invade, make me feel scared for germany or the UK, which reportedly have a lot of terrorist cells. So why didn't the US invade frankfurt?

&gt;It isn't imperialistic to be the only country that is strong enough to fight back with overwhelming force to defend allies.

yes it is, that is the main reason both world wars started, a huge country going to war to defend it's vasal.

&gt;USA has no interest in taking land.

taking land is overrated, a puppet goverment and some temporary troops are sufficient, you just give state contracts to rebuild and sell some military hardware and you get all the benefits without the hardship. Britain never actually invaded CHina, you don't need the land when you can take the economy. But again, most middle eastern conflicts are strategical, masive nation wide conflicts would basically shut down saudi oil and that would be very bad for the world economy. BAd world economy, angry people, agry people make for hard to manipulate voters: as you will see when the russian issue turns into a energy issue.

We did support a uprising in what was a crucial post cold war ""neutral zone"". Morally it was the right thing to do(kinda, the new goverment does have some fascist tendecies), historically it's a made up country, again a consequence or arbitrary borders drawn by non natives. Strategically it was a huge FUCK YOU to Putin which was already on shaky terms with his electorate: the radical nationalists.

Lets say the state of new york goes independent, and after 20 years a huge communist revolutions swells up and China embraces and guarantees for their portection. Would the US have been as calm as russia? I doubt it, they would have invalidated the second wall street turned into a open conflict, under the arguent of ""peace keeping"".

They would pile people up into trucks and take them out into the desert and have them leave and just start shooting at them until they all died under the pretense of they were moving elsewhere. It was fucking horrifying just to listen to it. These people are genocidal.

The Boston bomber was just some kid. What they did was awful, but it wasn't a government supported action. There isn't any reason to invade Chechnya. It would make no sense. I also don't care about terrorists living in Germany. I mean, I obviously don't want any harm coming to any Germans, but I don't blame German government for their actions. Osama wasn't just inside of Afghanistan, he was HOSTED there as a honored guest. Why are you creating strawman arguments in saying any country can be invaded for simply having people there. It was no secret that Osama was there.

The comment about cars killing people was me making fun of your civilian shooting comment. A terrorist act that causes insane amount of death and financial damage and fear is not just some random violent criminal. It was a serious matter.

Why is it imperialistic to defend allies? I still don't understand that. USA has ONE base on the planet that pisses people off. Cuba. They obtained it under from a lease from the prior government. Every other base is under agreement with the local government. USA is a guest everywhere. Iraq asked them to leave and they did. They then promptly asked them to come right back. Imperialists don't give a shit about allies and they don't listen to allies either. They take over land and do whatever the fuck they want. If your country was invaded, I would want USA to be there to help you and keep your country safe. I don't support USA taking over countries. I support USA helping people and attacking USA's enemies. I am critical of USA actions judged on their own. I don't sit around and say they are evil because they go to war too much over 200 years.

I thought USA was wrong for Iraq, but the way you talk, you are basically saying USA is wrong for even existing. It has lots of allies that ask for favors. USA takes all of their alliances very seriously. It comes when called otherwise they look undependable and USA would lose influence all over the world. USA needs to be trusted in order to keep friendly relations.

Also, fuck analogies. I've heard so many damn stories about Canada and Mexico and all this other nonsense turning against USA. USSR fell in 1991. Ukraine is not a ""made up country"". They are a group of people that have been invaded a long time ago against their will. They have been trapped in USSR just like the Baltic countries. They have suffered genocide and ethnic cleansing and Russians tried to erase Ukrainian culture over the years. After 1991 Russia had over two decades to make Ukraine a close ally. Instead they have pissed Ukraine with aggression and pushed them away. Putin has no one to blame but himself for having Ukrainians angry with Russia. I genuinely hope Ukraine joins EU. I want them to have a chance to have a good life like other countries that have joined EU. I want them to feel safe. No one should have to live in trapped in poverty and in fear of violence just because of politics. I only wish USA could do even more to help them.

Loser never gets to tell their side? They always get a chance to tell their side. Who said USA is always right? I have said repeatedly Iraq was bullshit.

The reason for this is that Oestrich, Mittelheim, and Winkel have a combined population of about 12,000.  There is not a whole lot to do there.  Almost everything that there is to do there has to do with the wine industry, which, in the Rheingau, is focused on rich German retirees.

Geisenheim, just west of Oestrich-Winkel, feels a bit bigger, even though it's really not.  Rüdesheim is a little bit further down and does have some residential areas, but they are mostly way up on the hill.  Most of Rüdesheim exists for the pleasure of tourists, too.

There is no longer a young population any more.  Most younger people have moved to Mainz, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt, or Koblenz.  There are trains and buses back and forth between Mainz and Wiesbaden at least once an hour.

Also, if you look at maps of the area... Rhein cliffs are generally pretty steep.  The ""Rheinstraße"" area is relatively flat but otherwise, it gets really steep, really fast.  There also generally aren't buses that take you up the hills; be prepared to walk or ride a bike.

But producing something 'in the same way' is impossible when you are talking about most food products. Wine and cheese have different taste when you take the basic ingredients from fields on the opposite sides of the same mountain, it's preposterous to think that they could be the same product when produced in completely different *continents*.

&gt; What do you call a cheese that's functionally, aesthetically, and gastronomically identical to parmigiano if not parmigiano?

This is a spurious argument since imitations are not identical to the real deal. The various 'parmesans' do not taste like Parmigiano, don't have the same consistency, nor smell, hell most of the time they hardly even look the same.

I mean, look at these:

[this is a Parmigiano wedge, the real deal](http://www.agricolagiansanti.it/images/nutri1.jpeg)

[this is a Parmesan wedge, the imitation](http://gentlemaneconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/parmesan_cheese.png)

Do you see the differences? the texture at the point of cut is very obviously different, betraying the very different consistency of the two cheese types. The crust in Parmigiano is much thicker, which gives it a different aging. And with the exception of 2-year aged Parmigiano, you can't grate it in long strips like Parmesan, it breaks up.

The truth is, as we have noticed with muslim insurrectionists in the middle east (i'm not making a comment on wether their struggle was justified or not), once soldiers drop their uniforms (or identifying markers) they're indistinguishable from civilians, making any kind of formal NATO involvement extremely difficult and any casualties we make will be presented as civilian casualties which is something that will turn public opinion against NATO action swiftly. Something Israel can attest to having discovered quite recently. Like hamas, Russia can now start conflicts wherever it wishes. Any action taken by these countries to defend themselves risks quickly being seen as criminal in the eyes of the western public, making any long term defense extremely difficult.

Agree with most you said.

Ukraine was in wounded situation, and I think that is condition needed for Russias new tactics. If they would send their green men today, I think Baltics are capable of eliminating few ""tourists"". But if there is some sort of bigger unrest there might be some problems tackling everything at once. 

I really don't believe in full blown war between Nato and Russia. Both sides will try avoid it at all cost. Unless of course Putin hasn't lost his mind or his life is in danger due to some internal power struggle - which is rather realistic scenario with dictatorships.

*  Birrificio Lambrate (via Golgi): it's a small brewery with lots of amazing beers they personally brew. Usually there's a considerable crowd of people chatting and enjoying a beer on the sidewalks of via Golgi. They also have another pub in via Adelchi (a couple of block away).

* The Moonshine: this is my favourite. It's a small pub in via Ravenna (reachable with Metro 3, piazzale Corvetto stop), with lots of obscure beers from all over the world, amazing cakes (free cakes! You only leave a small offer) and crazy music/movies projected onto a small screen. You need to go there if you are in Milan because it's part of this city's history and sadly it will be closing soon (2/28/2015 will be their last day). 

* ARCI Ohibò: this is a club near piazzale Lodi. You can easily find interesting concerts and djsets there. There's also a pool table (you can play for free). Beware that you will get badly humiliated if you play against the baristas, they are too good. You need to be a member to get inside, but maybe they'll make you an exception with you since you're a foreigner. Also: Green Day played a secret concert there, meaning they came there, were invited on the stage by the owners and they played for free.

* Colonne di S. Lorenzo: people chatting and drinking all night long. It's near the Duomo square, cheap beers everywhere: you take one, you sit on the ground and you enjoy it.

* Love/Picchio bar: although they may seem shallow places to spend a night, there's a good chance to meet interesting people there. Not only locals, but also exchange students from all of Europe. Also, alcohol is quite cheap there. They are in via Melzo, near porta Venezia. 

Avoid Navigli if you don't want to spend lots of money on below average drinks. It's a beutiful place, but not by night.

Also, I'm in for a gelato/beer tonight, PM me if you like. Nothing too crazy as I'm working tomorrow though.

false,Chiara5,null,null,"Obviously I can't speak for all Italians, but to me the most important thing is where you grew up and lived most of your life (hence knowing the language), easily followed by knowing our traditions. Sons of immigrants who were born here and lived all of their lives here can't even get citizenship before they turn 18, but if they integrate, to me they are certainly no less Italian than sons of Italians who emigrated and lived all of their lives abroad. Because they lived here, immersed in our culture. There are exceptions tho, in both cases, some live very isolated in their own original culture and some people, like you, are more near to us than the average italo-whatever. Yet, both had strong influences from different cultures and this does make a difference.

I don't know if this could help you understand my thinking, but I assume you know we usually have some kind of attachment to our region too. In my case I lived all of my life in Lombardia, yet my grandparents came from 4 different regions. I call my father babbo like Tuscan people do, cook Liguria's regional dishes because my grandmother taught me to, use many words that are only common here, yet I don't speak the local dialect. It's common here, because many people immigrated from both the south and north-east of Italy and most of my friends have relatives in some other regions too. As a result, I don't really identify with my region much, I just see myself as a generic Italian. Others are way more attached to their region, or even province, than I will ever be. But that's not an issue, I don't have to belong to a region, I can just be a mix and be happy with it. While I care for traditions and I'm strongly attached to my country, I hope people in Europe will mix more in the future, it can only bring good things ;) After all, Italy itself is still pretty young.

I have to admit I do get a bit pissed when someone who is not Italian tries to convince me they are, simply because they're not. They're something different and perfectly good for what they are, why do they insist they're just like me when they're not? I know it sounds bad, but being different is just that, it's not something negative. You know less about Italy than I do, but sure you know More about Canada, that is part of what you are.

ps. I wrote too much.

Da haben wir doch etwas gelernt: Nicht mehr nationalitisch denken, Partnerschaften pflegen, Handel treiben, diplomatisch agieren, ... Also vielleicht die Gründung der EU im Jahr 1900?

Mein Argument zielte gegen diese Pazifisten, die immer so tun als könnte man Krieg einfach vermeiden.
Ich meine schon ganz konkret Belgien. Die haben in zwei Weltkriegen von uns eins auf die Mütze bekommen, wie hätten die das verhindern sollen? Man kann seinen Beitrag zum Frieden leisten aber das setzt auch immer die Bereitschaft bei den anderen voraus. Belgien hätte 1900 keine EU gründen können.

Gerade der zweite Weltkrieg hätte in dieser Form zu Ende sein können, bevor er zum Weltkrieg wurde, wenn Frankreich und England 1939 einfach in Deutschland einmarschiert wären. Das ist mal ein Paradebeispiel dafür, wie Kriegsmüdigkeit auch nach hinten losgehen kann. Natürlich wissen wir nicht, wie sich die Geschichte (Stalin) weiterentwickelt hätte, aber die oft kolportierte Idee, die Verteidigungsarmee steht einfach an der Grenze und hält dort den Feind auf, hat sich mit dem Westfeldzug von  1940 einfach erledigt.

Das stellt einen natürlich vor die viel schwierigere Frage zu entscheiden, wann und wie ein militärisches Eingreifen denn sinnvoll ist. Beenden läßt sich ein Konflikt so nicht aber gerade im Bosnienkonflikt hätte man vermutlich Schutzzonen für die Zivilbevölkerung auch robust verteidigen können.

&gt;A __rose engine lathe__ is a specialized kind of [geometric lathe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_lathe). The headstock rocks back and forth with a rocking motion or along the spindle axis in a pumping motion, controlled by a rubber moving against a rosette or cam-like pattern mounted on the spindle, while the lathe spindle rotates. Rose engine work can make flower patterns, as well as convoluted, symmetrical, multi-lobed organic patterns. The patterns it produces are similar to that of a [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph), in metal. No other ornamental lathe can produce these ""rose"" patterns. The decoration produced by a rose engine lathe is called [Guilloché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilloch%C3%A9).

But on a European scale, kids go to school either way. Teaching foreign languages is more of a cultural/political decision (what do we want to teach the kids?)  than an economic one. Various countries put different amount of emphasis on teaching languages. Some have no mandatory foreign language, some have more than 1.

In Croatia, every child learns English from an early age. I believe this is also the case for some other less-well-off European countries (such as Romania, probably Serbia, too).

On the other hand, in richer countries such as France, Italy and Spain, the emphasis on English is much lower, while in the equally rich Scandinavia, it is higher.

My country is not an economic powerhouse on its own and our language isn't widely understood, so I guess that  we feel it is more necessary for us to speak fluent English than it is for someone in Germany or France. It is certainly the case in practice - when you work with partners/clients who are, for example, Germans, you either communicate in German or English. The Germans aren't going to learn Croatian... Ukraine is probably in the same situation.

It may sound ""unfair"" (similar to how you hear Americans saying ""why would everyone in the US have to learn English?? Why shouldn't we all learn Spanish instead??"") but it is a fact of life and it is better to accept the fact that not all languages are equal if you want to prosper in life and happen to live in a country that is not large/rich enough for you to have the luxury of ignoring the limitations of only speaking your native language.

The politically correct stance that all languages are equal and OMG WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TO LEARN ENGLISH, WHY DON'T YOU LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE, widespread among intellectually lazy liberal anglophones with a lack of perspective on what life and business are like in other parts of the world is naive, it is simply not a view most of the world can afford to hold.",0,1412511949,null,0,1412529152,0,cl0xqmo,t3_2iadnk,t1_cl0xqmo,t1_cl0eulh,null,1426675734,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt; Keynes's ideas became widely accepted after World War II, and until the early 1970s, Keynesian economics provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries.[3] Governments prepared high quality economic statistics on an ongoing basis and tried to base their policies on the Keynesian theory that had become the norm. In the early era of new liberalism and social democracy, most western capitalist countries enjoyed low, stable unemployment and modest inflation, an era called the **Golden Age of Capitalism**.

Now, I had hoped that you'd have the intellectual honesty to admit that classical keynesianism worked splendidly in the post-war decades, much like I had the honesty to admit that it failed spectacularly later. But I remember from other discussions that intellectual honesty is not really your strong suit, and I'm not really fond of arguing with fanatics.

Also they were really enthusiastic about joining the war!

Willhelm 2. actually tried to stop the war at one point (he was a really weird character that still liked england while beeing an extreme german nationalist and militarist, its really interesting reading about him!) early on, he thought that without the British Empire joining in they could easily do peace negotiations etc. however at that time he heard they were already posturing up (and had been for quite some time) in order to enter the war.

People always try to paint the British Empire as those poor poor people that got sucked into the evil german/austrian war, however it was never as easy as that.

With the rise of nationalism and old hatred (Blutsfeindschaft) most countries were posturing/preparing/welcoming/starting the war, the thing that then finally kicked it off, was the assassination of the crownprince of the austrian empire.

Pour que tu comprennes pourquoi le FN s'y apparente:

http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazisme#Id.C3.A9ologie

&gt;Les nazis étaient xénophobes, demandant par exemple que « tous les non-Allemands établis en Allemagne depuis le 2 août 1914 soient immédiatement contraints de quitter le Reich », et que « tous les directeurs et collaborateurs de journaux paraissant en langue allemande soient des citoyens allemands »N 2. Ils s’opposaient à la « conception matérialiste du monde ». Ils étaient réellement anti-chrétiens, certains comme Himmler voulant instaurer une forme de paganisme alors que le Reich souhaite placer les Églises du Reich sous sa tutelle en imposant la création du « christianisme positif ». Le programme national-socialiste prétendait également avoir une dimension sociale, symbolisée par le rouge dans le drapeau nazi, qu'il imposa à l'AllemagneN 3. D'après les travaux de l'historien Götz Aly, les nazis témoignaient d'un réel souci des classes populaires19 : ils réorganisent les professions, créent des mutuelles et des prestations sociales, luttent contre le chômage, favorisent des loisirs et des fêtes pour les couches populaires, etc. Pour Aly, c'est d'ailleurs là l'une des clés de la popularité du régime. La tendance « socialisante » de la doctrine nazie fut cause de dissensions graves entre les dirigeants du parti. À ses débuts, Joseph Goebbels qualifiait ainsi le nazisme de « bolchévisme national ».

À cela s'ajoute que le FN ne s'oppose lui même à la gauche internationnale, tout comme les nazis:

&gt;L'acronyme « nazisme » est la contraction de « national-socialisme » (Nationalsozialismus en allemand). En effet, le « national-socialisme » se veut distinct du « socialisme international », c'est-à-dire des mouvements socialistes internationalistes, d'inspiration marxiste ou non, tels que l'Internationale socialiste ou l'Internationale communiste, dont la vocation « antipatriotique » était à l'opposé du nationalisme pangermaniste hitlérien. L'idéologie nazie se distingue également d'autres doctrines nationalistes de l'époque comme, en France, le « socialisme national » de Maurice Barrès, qui disait combiner nationalisme et « socialisme », mais rejetait les théories racistes du nazisme allemand.

Bref, en quelques mots, un parti à forte dimmension xenophobe et développant une stratégie socialisante est un parti d'inspiration Nazi.

It's not like over million of Poles from parts of Poland invaded and occupied by Soviet Union in 1939 weren't deported to Siberia in 1940 and 1941 only for what they were. Most of them have not survived until the end of war. I'm pretty sure it counts as ""being massively killed no matter who you are"".

I strongly would encourage a diplomatic intervention, I would bully the syrian, the turkish and Iraqian goverment into allowing a sunni state. I would even support a UN peace keeping force of non muslims. I however do not think proping up a Iraqui, Syrian, Iranian or even pakistani or saudi goverment artificially is moral, just because we rationalise that would reduce casualties.(and bz change it also maintiains our influence in the region).

yes, a Sunni state would create massive problems with Iran, but that would also make Iran a much stronger ally in the region, more powerfull than even saudi arabia.

The difference between radicals and bureaucrats is that the latter have something to lose. Give them a state which they need to keep happy and they will turn into docile politicians within 2 election cycles.(do you think fighting a bodyless ideal like the Istamic state will be won in less than 8 years if zou use bombs?) Within a state, radicalism is just political rethoric(rethoric that as seen in egypt most people reject), outside of the state it is fanaticism.

En mettant en concurrence tous les travailleurs du monde, tu crée une pression sur sur les travailleurs ayant le plus d'avantages salariaux/sociaux. 
Malheureusement, croire que la France peut vivre en autarcie est simpliste, le commerce international est vital pour nous. Il est étonnant de croire qu'en ayant recours à des mesures protectionnistes voire isolationnistes, les autres pays du monde n'en ferait pas autant avec nous. Ce qui logiquement impliques plus de coût pr les produits français, moins d'intérêt pour les consommateurs (étranger) et une perte nette pour nos entreprise. D'autre part, comme on l'a vu avec le référendum Écossais, les multinationales ( en tout cas les financières) étaient prêtes a quitter l'Ecosse en cas de oui. L'arrivé du FN sera mal vu par les marché, et les actionnaires avec probablement des départs.
Rien que la sortie de l'euro, qui engendra une inflation énorme et par conséquent des pertes pour les action cotée en France peut être une raison de migrer économiquement. Sans compter qu'un des avantages principaux de l'euro, est qu'étant attaché à un très grand nombre de pays ( et de monnaies initialement), il est bcp plus résistant aux attaques spéculatives.

To me, it looks like you have a very sensitive spot about strongly wanting to be recognized as Italian, which somehow translates as being recognized as a person, as what you are, so you tend to overinterpret things like this which don't carry any particular meaning, as seen from outside.

&gt; While this is a question of viewpoints, it's also a question of signed treaties and USA isn't upholding theirs.

well, clearly that ""agreement"" is not effective.  otherwise european agricultural co-ops with european regional trademarks would be able to sue U.S. companies for infringement,  and the issue would already be resolved. As it is, the US and european countries are not on the same page.

From what I understand,  the U.S. argues that european countries haven't held up obligations on their end. I haven't sorted through the whole document but it seems like y'all are asking the US to recognize your regional trademarks but providing no avenue for U.S. companies to have any of theirs recognized in europe.

Clairement à l'initiave des USA/UK mais nous en tant que pays ""développés"" c'etait aussi dans notre intérêts et on y a fait des gros bénéfices à travers nos nombreuses firmes transnationnales. Maintenant, il est clair, que la mondialisation a forcé une forme d'éffacement de l'Etat Nation, en créant des entreprises gigantesques qui ont des interêts dans de nombreux pays. Les intérêts principaux de ces sociétés se situent dans le monde et plus du tout leur pays de naissances, en gros elles sont devenues apatrides. Leur puissances et leur influence est telles qu'elles ont fait jouer leur pouvoir de lobby pour influencer les règles internationales en leur sens, vers plus (trop) de dérégulations. 

Cependant, dans le système international actuel, l'Etat Nation reste la seule entité capable de légiférer au sein de l'espace international. 
Les FTN peuvent exercer un pouvoir de lobby, mais seul l'Etat Nation peut emmètre des lois. 
Le système international est totalement dominé par les USA qui restent leader et ont un pouvoir d'influence sur tous les pays, et ce pays est soumis aux millionaires ce qui n'est pas vraiment en faveur des travailleurs. (ça doit sonné Marxiste dit comme ça lol)

Après il faut se rappeler que l'UE en tant qu'entité économique représente un poids plus important que les USA. Cette union, si elle fonctionnait comme une union, aurait la possibilité et la légitimité, de par sa puissance, de  concurrencer le leadership des USA. ( tout comme la Chine pourra le faire bientôt si elle continue à se renforcer)

&gt;Perso je suis pour du protectionnisme a l'échelle européen avec des accords bilatéraux pour se fournir en matière premières.

Perso je suis pour le protectionisme aussi, mais seulement il doit être utilisé pour de bonne raison et non par peur de l'autre. Le protectionnisme européen est une très bonne idée sur le papier, mais bcp trop de nos membres sont à la solde du leadership américains pour oser s'opposer à eux. La preuve est que nombre d'états membre considèrent que la défense européenne sera faite par les USA, au lieu de réfléchir à une défense européenne commune.

Double negatives aren't a new thing, but a relic of very old English grammar. Some European languages use double and even triple negatives to this day -- Russian is a prime example (a phrase I once heard ""ni ne s kem ne gulyai"" literally translates as ""neither don't go walking with nobody""). French also uses a construction that is effectively a double negative, although its history is slightly different.

In the context of those dialects, I would argue that it's not a grammatical mistake, so much as a feature of the language, similar to Spanish, Italian (?), French and certain English dialects. It's not particularly common, though.

The abertzale left identifies itself as patriotic, not nationalist. And although there might be very little difference between both terms, you'll find that modern Basque nationalism is not based on ethnic or racial grounds. Anyway, Bildu does not directly promote independence but self-determination, as the right of any community of peoples to choose their own future. 

&gt;you don't need One language, One people, One nation to defend a culture.

You seem to be implying that multiple nations and cultures can co-exist within the Spanish state. Time has proven that wrong. Unless the whole of Spain changes its mentality towards the cultures that are not part of the mainstream Castilian one (and the fact that the PP/PSOE is still voted by the majority of the Spanish population proves they are not willing to compromise), complete co-existence (without major parts of the population asking for self-determination) is impossible.

&gt;In the specific case of Spain, there has been a transition between a one-party fascism towards a multi-party fake-democracy fascism. Or do you really think a fascist regime walks away because they had a change of heart? Why do you think that Podemos and Guanyem is attacked with lies and ad hominems?

Spain is rotten to the core, I don't need any convincing in that part. 

&gt;The problem of Spain is there hasn't been any major left-wing party, not even IU.

The left is divided and the right is well organized, that's evident, but

&gt; if all the ""left"" independentists would have worked together to form a broad left platform, there would be little periods of PP rule, if any.

Bildu, ERC (CUP?) and other minor left-leaning political parties could work together, there are two problems though; not even together form a majority that could take the PP-PSOE-UPyD out of the political scenario, and two, they have very different end goals. Bildu wants the independence of the Basque Country and ERC and CUP the independence of Catalonia. The rest, while some have stated they're in favour of a consultation, are pro-union.

Once you progressed, I suggest signing up for German speaking chatrooms or using this subreddit, the subreddit's IRC channel to practice your German. If you can afford it, traveling to a German speaking country is always a great way of learning the language and also of understanding German culture (which IMHO is really important if you want to learn and *comprehend* a language on an advanced level.)

Sur l'une d'entre elles était écrit : Le maintien d'un système industriel pourri n'a rien à voir avec le nationalisme. Je peux aimer l'Allemagne et détester le capitalisme33.
&gt;Hitler exprimait, autant en public qu'en privé, un profond mépris pour le capitalisme, l'accusant de prendre les Nations en otage au bénéfice des intérêts d'une classe de rentiers « cosmopolites et parasites »34. Il s'opposait à l'économie de marché et à la recherche effrénée du profit, et souhaitait une économie respectueuse de l'intérêt général35. Il n'estimait pas le capitalisme digne de confiance en raison de sa nature égoïste, et lui préférait une économie dirigiste subordonnée aux intérêts du peuple34. Hitler affirma en 1934 à un cadre du parti que « le système économique contemporain était la création des Juifs34. » Hitler confia un jour à Benito Mussolini que « le capitalisme a[vait] fait son temps »34. Hitler estimait également que la grande bourgeoisie d'affaires « ne connaissait rien d'autre que les profits. La Patrie n'est qu'un mot pour eux. »36 Hitler considérait Napoléon comme un modèle pour son comportement anti-conservateur, anti-capitaliste et anti-bourgeois37.](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazisme#Anticapitalisme)

false,totitiganiisuntgunoi,ROMA,Romania,"This is one issue where a pragmatic EU-wide policy is desperately needed. The problem is twofold, starting with an inconsistent set of policies that draw asylum seekers on life-threatening journeys to try to reach European shores, and ending with a fragmented apparatus for dealing with this flow of refugees, placing an undue burden on those border states such as Italy that are at the forefront of the crisis. 

In regards to the problem of policy, the key ingredient that is needed is honesty. Many EU states have very generous policies towards asylum seekers, guaranteeing asylum to broad categories of refugees *as long as they can reach their territory.* The second part of that sentence is the root of most of the problems, migrants are offered the prospect of asylum, with all its implications of safety and welfare, which must seem like a godsend given their desperate condition, and yet in many cases they are not given a safe way to reach those countries and obtain asylum. Of course, this is not simply an oversight by the well-meaning European countries offering asylum, but is in fact the unofficial way in which governments seek to minimize the numbers of refugees they will be forced to ultimately take in. This policy, however, is completely irresponsible, since it is inevitable that by offering the tantalizing benefits of asylum without allowing those targeted to safely enter into their countries, these countries are directly fueling the problem of countless migrants risking their lives, and often dying, in a desperate trek to reach Europe by any means. 

It would be much better if every country was open about the number of asylum seekers they were willing to absorb and to then provide a safe means for those people to travel to their host country to accept asylum. The total cap on the number of migrants would of course remain contentious, since certain people with legitimate claims to asylum would have to be turned down.
However, this unfortunate reality also exists today, except that in many cases it is enforced through informal barriers (such as the hurdles migrants face in reaching Europe), rather than through official policy.

Secondly, since it would be naive to think that transparent policies could ever hope to stem the migrant problem altogether, European states must come together to create a common mechanism for dealing with the migrants, from protecting European shores, to rescuing migrants whose lives are at risk, and finally to dealing with those migrants that do end up in Europe. It is not fair to place the majority of the financial and logistic burden on the border states. All EU states should help to finance the coast-guard operations and the refugee camps, and if there are migrants in Europe whose case for asylum is such that they cannot be deported, more states should step in to accommodate these individuals such that no one country is overwhelmed by the number of refugees they must care for.",0,1412524068,null,0,false,0,cl11hsi,t3_2ict07,t1_cl11hsi,t3_2ict07,null,1426673912,97,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,97

&gt;la culture de l'autre entraînerait nécessairement la fin de ma culture

Non plus. Ça n'a strictement jamais été dit. Par contre le FN dit simplement que la culture française est la mieux adaptée pour les Français.

&gt;le droit pour les autres impliquerait moins de droit pour moi

Toujours pas. Par contre, dans un environnement contraint où il n'y a pas de ressources ni d'argent pour tout le monde, on préfère donner aux Français avant les autres.

Tes 3 premiers points sont des hommes de paille.

&gt;c'est moins d'impôts donc moins d'argent pour assurer le service publique et plus de libéralisme à la sauce américaine

D'une part moins d'impôts ne veut pas dire moins d'argent... C'est un principe économique de base ([courbe de Laffer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courbe_de_Laffer)). 

Ensuite, le FN pense qu'il y a trop d'impôts sur les PME et les nationaux, mais pas assez pour les multi-nationales. Encore une déformation.

&gt;plus tu as d'argent, mieux tu vivras (tu auras droit aux meilleurs soins, à la meilleure éducation, etc.

C'est une invention pure et simple. Qu'est-ce qui te permet de dire cela sur la base des programmes de 2012 ou de 2007 ?

&gt;il y a tout un système (petit et sans pouvoir mais qui existe) et qui constitue le socle intellectuel du parti. Je ne veux pas faire de la publicité mais il y a une radio nationaliste qui étale les thèses qui seront lois si le l'extrême droite était au pouvoir.

Oui et donc en écoutant radio courtoisie tu t'aperçois que les mesures libérales sont atténuées par des éléments dirigistes et populistes. Tout comme De Gaulle avait [Jacques Rueff](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Rueff) et [Antoine Pinay](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Pinay) au début, puis Giscard et Debré qui ne sont pas exactement socialistes, ça n'a absolument pas mené à une politique ultra-libérale d'inégalités.

C'est exactement la même chose pour le FN.

&gt;Et crois moi, à moins que tu aies 120 ans et/ou que tu sois très à l'aise financièrement, tu ne souhaiterais pas vivre dans une France comme ça en 2017.

Genitori di sesso diverso = Possibilità di imparare a rapportarsi con entrambi i sessi, cosa che poi verrà approfondita dal ragazzo/ragazza per conto suo, una volta cresciuto.

Genitori di sesso uguale = Non si viene esposti a un modello comportamentale di un sesso, perciò la propria educazione sociale tenderà a essere orientata verso i modi di fare di un sesso solo. Buttando giù qualche percentuale random, giusto per rendere l'idea, si avrebbe che una persona ha capacità relazionali con donne dell'80% (esempio) e con gli uomini del 20% (esempio).

Questo potrebbe potenzialmente portare a difficoltà una volta che la persona in questione è cresciuta.

Now, andiamoci giù di proverbi e di matematica:

""Il troppo stroppia"" ; ""La stabilità di un qualcosa esiste se c'è un equilibrio"".

La stabilità emotiva e sociale di una persona è garantita (eccetto nei casi di maltrattamento o altro, vedi DISCLAIMER) da un equilibrio. Equilibrio significa 50/50, e siccome mi sto distruggendo il cervello a ingegneria, a questo 50/50 ci si aggiunge una tolleranza. Perciò abbiamo un bel **50 +/- f** /// **50 +/- m**.

Cosa significa +/- f o m? Significa che durante la crescità alcune persone sono più vicine a modelli comportamentali femminili/maschili, indipendentemente dalla loro esposizione a entrambi i sessi, perciò qualcuno verrà fuori con 40/60 (esempio) nonostante tutto.

In poche parole, non credo che una coppia omosessuale sia in grado (non dipende da loro) di crescere un bambino/a come una coppia eterosessuale.


DISCLAIMER: ho volutamente escluso i casi di famiglie etero dove avvengono abusi, orfanotrofi lager e famiglia dove sfortunatamente manca un genitore. Credo che i primi, purtroppo, siano un fenomeno non completamente eliminabile, mentre la seconda si, annullando dunque il discorso che fanno tanti, ovvero ""Meglio in una coppia omo che in un posto schifoso"".

Personne ne parle de vivre en autarcie... Simplement de rééquilibrer par des droits sur le pays qui font de la concurrence déloyale. C'est exactement ce que proposait Maurice Allais (voir en particulier [cet article](http://www.les-crises.fr/allais-les-effets-destructeurs/) et si vous avez le temps [cette série d'articles](http://www.les-crises.fr/tag/maurice-allais/).

&gt;Il est étonnant de croire qu'en ayant recours à des mesures protectionnistes voire isolationnistes, les autres pays du monde n'en ferait pas autant avec nous.

Les autres pays le font déjà en fait. La Chine évidemment et surtout, mais les États-Unis aussi via le Buy American Act et le Small Business Act. Ensuite, on pourrait parler de l'Allemagne qui mène une politique de beggar-thy-neighbour avec sa stratégie économique et en profitant de l'euro à notre détriment.

Le FN propose donc de corriger ces inégalités déjà existantes contre lesquelles l'UE ne fait rien.

&gt;Ce qui logiquement impliques plus de coût pr les produits français, moins d'intérêt pour les consommateurs (étranger) et une perte nette pour nos entreprise.

Non. Tout comme la TVA sociale, ça permet de redonner de la compétitivité face à une concurrence déloyale.

&gt;D'autre part, comme on l'a vu avec le référendum Écossais, les multinationales ( en tout cas les financières) étaient prêtes a quitter l'Ecosse en cas de oui.

Encore une fois c'est déjà le cas. On perd une usine par jour ouvré.

&gt;L'arrivé du FN sera mal vu par les marché, et les actionnaires avec probablement des départs. Rien que la sortie de l'euro, qui engendra une inflation énorme et par conséquent des pertes pour les action cotée en France peut être une raison de migrer économiquement.

La croissance que permettrait une sortie de l'euro est très bien vue par les marchés en fait. La dépréciation rend l'activité française beaucoup plus attractive, et les capitaux étrangers viendraient donc plus facilement. Sans compter que l'inflation réduit le coût de la dette existante.

&gt;Sans compter qu'un des avantages principaux de l'euro, est qu'étant attaché à un très grand nombre de pays ( et de monnaies initialement), il est bcp plus résistant aux attaques spéculatives.

La spéculation s'est déjà reportée sur la dette (on le voit avec les PIGS). Cet argument n'est pas valide.

Le siège du cab' ou je bosse est à Zürich, et les quelques Suisses qui bossent pour nous nous expliquent que c'est une attitude généralisée en Suisse. /u/canteloupy pourrait confirmer ou infirmer, mais c'est vrai que quelques boîtes suisses pour lesquelles on a bossé nous ont expliqué que si on pouvait avoir un candidat européen francophone non-français, ça serait bien, merci. 

Le seul truc qui, je trouve, à un soupçon de vérité dans ce qu'ils disent, c'est l'arrogance. C'est vrai que les candidats français ont tendance à avoir une haute opinion d'eux-mêmes, plus que d'autres, à l'exception des Britanniques qui se vendent avec plus d'acharnement que le meilleur des camelots de la foire de Paris. C'est un peu étonnant sachant que, parallèlement, le Français n'aime pas se vendre.
