The idea of renaming food to show opposition to a country originated with German foods during the World Wars.  For example, sauerkraut was renamed ""Liberty Cabbage.""  Doing that to German foods during the Iraq War would've been too explicit a reference to times when our countries were at war.  It would've been going too far.

In contrast to that very serious history of animosity (now behind us) between US and Germany, France has long been a target for easy jokes that don't have real hostility behind them.

Some French people (rightly) pointed out that what we call french fries are actually Belgian.

I'm from San Francisco, to most people here and in other major areas like New York, LA, this made us want to pretend we didn't know these people.

I was maybe 14 or 15 years old, had a shovel and a whole day. It got boring that time to just run into the water or paddle on my air mattress like I used to do all the other days. Also my parents didn't plan any sightseeing. That hot Swiss girl that made fun of me by talking Italian to her sister wasn't to find anywhere. So I started digging, maybe if I could drive it deep enough the water of the Atlantic would flood it from the bottom up. That way I would get my own private swimming pool. A few hours and many head shaking tourists later there was a dangerous looking trench with a German in it at the beach. Now sitting in my new constructed bunker I thought how amazing it must be if I could drive a tunnel down to the waterline. I started working on it but shortly after, I realized that this was way too much work for one single person. My little brother had to help me. After a while of painful fight against the burning sun to keep the sand wet and my cave from falling in, our parents told us that we leave now and we have to fill the hole up again. After some minutes of protest I gave up and helped my brother out of the crater. Me and my dad quickly shovelled the sand back into the hole and left. Civilisation had me back again.

The problem with spending too much of their reserves can be found in many other ""non-reserve"" non-stable currencies. For instance the Swiss Franc is far from a reserve currency, but people trust the government of Switzerland so when there is trouble in the global economy money pours into it as a safe haven.

The ruble is *far* from that. Its closer to the situation the Argentine Peso is in. Their currency weakened against the Dollar 19% in just the first month of this year. It was not due to ""printing"" money but rather because they are spending much of their foreign reserves to pay their liabilities and defend their currency's decline against the dollar. 

Foreign reserves of quality currencies are treated almost like gold during the gold standard. They're seen as a backstop to a national currency's weakness. 

Russia has one very notable difference. It has energy. But this is no guarantee. You only need to look to another South American country to see this. Venezuela's currency, the Bolivar, has plummeted this year against the dollar. I believe it even fared worse than the Argentine Peso. The black market rate is at 90 to 1 dollar, the official rate is 6.3. Much of this was caused by dwindling US Dollar reserves and a shortage of dollars in the country. 

It was just proven that Venezuela has more proven energy reserves than Saudi Arabia. This just goes to show, even if a country has ample energy reserves, foreign currency reserves are still the ""gold standard"" when gauging the stability of a currency (for lack of a better term). Their central banks can sell dollars or euros in a single day as a tool to manipulate the price of their currency, ramping up energy production can take years.

Russia's rich might keep their wealth in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Francs, but average people sure don't. And they're the ones that would be forming a Maiden type movement.

Russia is already violating the treaty, especially if they actually go through with annexing Crimea.  I'd like to see the US invoke the treaty and hold it over Russia's head.  Of course, if Ukraine still had its nukes, then Putin would be far less bold in marching troops into Ukraine in the first place.  He's counting on everyone else letting him do what he wants because they are too afraid to do anything about it.  

As I said above, since Russia hasn't hesitated to deploy troops, the US and EU should bring on the sanctions yesterday and perhaps deploy some troops of their own.  Surely if Putin can invoke ""protection of Russian speakers"" the US and UK can invoke a treaty signed by Russia.  Give the Russians a reason to blink first in this staring contest.  Ian Brzezinski's comments on Morning Joe today hit the nail on the head.  Putin is an ex-KGB colonel.  He understands force, and it's going to take more than 6 F-16's to Poland for him to respond.  At the same time, while western economies may take a short-term hit from placing sanctions on Russia, if they all do it at once I think it could bring the Russian economy to its knees.  Also, I think it should be made clear that long-term damage to Russia's diplomatic and economic standing in the world has been done, and western nations should, for example, reduce their reliance on Russian oil and natural gas.

no, society tells you a size 3 women isn't commercially exploitable and can't be a model. Feminism however overreacts and get offended that I am not attracted to someone that has more than 25% body fat. It's not about fat shaming it's about attraction, I have no choice in the matter and it can not be bullied into me with political corectness.

Feminism is not special in this case. Most currents of taught are neutered by this phenomenon. Popular authors sell 2 or 3 books, they get notoriety and gain speaking requests, the money flows in and the former professor ends up earning exponentially more than he did last year.

This is anecdotal, but I heard other Americans say that they could understand German opposition to the invasion, because Germany has a policy of principled opposition to war.  

However, they didn't see France as making such a principled stand, because France had close economic ties with Saddam and stood to benefit from trade with Iraq when the sanctions were lifted, which was about to happen when the war started. 

So perhaps there was some actual animosity against France at the time.  Supporters of the Iraq War cast it as a humanitarian venture, and France was (for a short time) seen as the buddy of a terrible dictator.  

Still, the France-bashing was easier and less controversial because of our history of light-hearted jokes about France.

Tl;dr: Germany opposition to the war was seen as a principled stand based on consistent moral values, whereas French opposition was seen as self-interest based on a desire to conduct economic activity with Saddam.

What are *you* talking about? I never stated anything of the sort in my own comments. Other people have brought it up, but I just said that Europe ought to look out for its own interests and the first step in doing so is to spend more on their militaries instead of relying on the United States to pick up the slack. How does that translate into ""Europe needs to have a *unified* military?""

Anyway the proposition does not necessarily translate to ""Europe needs to have a common army with a common flag, etc."" because that's ridiculous. Nobody seriously expects that to happen and it would never work. In all likelihood it would probably just mean a framework for a joint European military command, effectively NATO minus all the American hand-holding. And as an American I would like that because it would allow the US to cut back its own spending a little bit.

Working with Russia was part of a plan to lower costs while a new fleet of much less expensive to operate spacecraft are made, and as a signal a new era of cooperation has arrived (clearly that part may have been premature). 

NASA could just un-retire its spacecraft, pay another agency more (for instance the ESA) or push back projects until its own/commercial spacecraft are complete.

Ich hoffe, das wird nie eintreten. Ich bin der Meinung, dass Hausunterricht den Unterricht an einer öffentlichen Schule nicht ersetzen kann. Für mich besteht auch die Gefahr, dass der Unterricht mit religiösen Inhalten (Schöpfungslehre, Intelligent Design, Geschlechterrollen usw) überladen wird und diese Kinder im sozialen Vergleich ins Hintertreffen geraten. Es ist auch nicht auszuschließen, dass dadurch eine neue Generation von religiösen Fundamentalisten heranwächst, die abgekapselt von ihrer Umwelt in ihrem eigenen Kulturkreis leben, was in meinen Augen die Bildung von Parallelgesellschaften unterstützen würde.  

Auch wenn man argumentieren kann, dass es auch heute schon die Sorte von Eltern gibt, die ihre Kinder mit fragwürdigen Inhalten füttern und versuchen, sie von der Außenwelt abzuschirmen, gibt es wenigstens im Schulunterricht bzw. den Einflüssen Gleichaltriger eine Art ""Kontrastprogramm"".

France has had, for decades beforehand, a very strong independent foreign policy. Independent from the US' and NATO's. Germany was naturally closer to the US and NATO because the Iron Curtain was right there, and because Germany didn't have a large army anymore, nor nuclear deterrence, nor its own interests in its colonies or former colonies. France however, remained a world actor and did its own things without US approval, sometimes specifically against US interests. This has often pissed off the US government. So the Iraq War refusal was the icing on the cake after decades of France being so insubordinate. 

Also, France had Veto power and used it. Germany doesn't.

La gita consisteva nell'uscire la sera dopo cena per fare un giro in auto, andare in una birreria fuori città a prendere una birra e parlare di eventuali problemi adolescenziali.

Io non ci sono mai uscito da solo ma qualche mio amico sì. In particolare uno di questi una volta mi disse che mentre erano su una collina a guardare le stelle e parlare furono fermati dalla polizia che fece parecchie domande sul perché e percome ci fossero un adulto e un ragazzino in auto in cima a una collina. Siete per caso parenti? Ragazzino come mai non hai i documenti? Sei sicuro che vada tutto bene e che sia tutto a posto?

Questo racconto fu come una madeleine e mi fece capire come mai a pelle non mi era mai andato di uscire da solo con questo signore.

true,Aluhut,null,null,"Der Lucki hat sich bei [Fresse-Buch](https://www.facebook.com/alternativefuer.de/posts/775639062447759) geäußert dazu:

&gt; Die Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung veröffentlichte am 9. März 2014 (und gestern in der FAZ, siehe unten) einen abenteuerlich zusammengereimten Artikel, in dem behauptet wird, die AfD wandle sich zu einer erzkonservativ und christlich-fundamentalistisch aufgestellten Partei.
&gt; 
&gt; Nichts davon ist wahr.
&gt; Die ‪#‎AfD‬ bleibt die Partei des gesunden Menschenverstands und gesunder Menschenverstand verträgt sich weder mit Ideologie noch mit Fundamentalismus. Im Folgenden nehmen Bernd Lucke und Beatrix von Storch kurz Stellung zu dem Artikel Ankenbrands:
&gt; 
&gt; Bernd Lucke:
&gt; Ich bin alles andere als ein fundamentalistischer Christ. Ich bin Mitglied der evangelisch-reformierten Kirche in Hamburg, die der EKD angehört. Rund zwei Millionen evangelische Christen in Deutschland sind reformierten Bekenntnisses, darunter Frank-Walter Steinmeier und der verstorbene Bundespräsident Rau. Refomierte Kirchen sind tendenziell liberaler und demokratischer organisiert als die lutherischen oder die unierten evangelischen Kirchen. Die Zeiten calvinistischer Kirchenzucht sind längst vorbei und die Bezeichnung ""Calvinist"" ist für reformierte Christen nicht mehr üblich. Die Tatsache, dass Herr Ankenbrand mich (ohne jeden Beleg) als ""sittenstrengen Calvinisten"" bezeichnet, ist offenkundig tendenziös gemeint und wohl nur der Frustration darüber zuzuschreiben, dass er mir keine außerehelichen Affären anhängen konnte. Meine theologischen Anschauungen sind so weit vom Fundamentalismus entfernt wie es nur irgend geht.
&gt; 
&gt; Die Behauptung, ich empfände Frauenerwerbstätigkeit als ""ein Problem"", ist frei erfunden. Ich habe so etwas nie gesagt. Meine eigene Frau ist seit langer Zeit berufstätig, meine Mutter war es, meine Schwester und meine Schwägerin sind es, meine Töchter werden es sein. Was Herr Ankenbrand schreibt, ist einfach unwahr. Im Übrigen bejahe ich sowohl die allgemeine Schulpflicht als auch die steuerliche Gleichstellung homosexueller Lebenspartnerschaften. Zu beidem hat mich Herr Ankenbrand überhaupt nicht befragt.
&gt; 
&gt; Herr Ankenbrand hat mich nämlich für diesen Artikel interviewt - wobei man allerdings nicht hören konnte, was er im Sinn hatte. Nach einem langen Gespräch hat er mir eine Handvoll von angeblichen Zitaten geschickt. Zitate sind bei manchen Journalisten nicht etwa das, was der Interviewte gesagt hat, sondern das, was der Interviewer gerne gehört hätte. Deshalb musste ich alle Zitate umschreiben, bis sie wieder so waren, wie ich mich geäußert hatte. Zu Ihrer Information dokumentiere ich Ihnen hier die Zitate, die ich autorisiert habe. Kaum etwas davon hat Herr Ankenbrand verwendet. Es passte nicht in seine Story. Das nennt man ergebnisorientierten Journalismus:
&gt; 
&gt; „Frau Metzger hat aufopferungsvoll und unter einer sehr hohen Arbeitsbelastung ein Jahr lang ehrenamtlich für uns gearbeitet. Sie will sich nun um den Aufbau einer eurokritischen Stiftung kümmern. Ich kann völlig verstehen, dass sie nicht beides machen kann.“
&gt; Daraus wurde im Artikel: „Wer dachte, der Ökonom aus Hamburg wolle mit der Kritik am Euro vor allem früheren FDP-Anhängern eine neue Heimat bieten hat sich geirrt. […] Jene in der AfD, die gegen den Euro sind […] haben verloren. […] In der Partei geht das nicht mehr.“
&gt; 
&gt; „Die politische Ausrichtung der AfD ändert sich nicht im Geringsten.”
&gt; Daraus wurde im Artikel: „In der AfD übernehmen bibeltreue Protestanten die Macht.“
&gt; 
&gt; „Nach den derzeitigen Meinungsumfragen wird die AfD sechs bis acht Sitze im Europaparlament erhalten. Aber wir haben noch nicht mit dem Wahlkampf begonnen, insofern ist das noch ausbaufähig.“
&gt; 
&gt; “Ich bin kein Liberaler, weil ich nun mal Christdemokrat bin. Ich war 33 Jahre lang in der CDU und wurde von meiner Partei verlassen. Das ändert nichts an meiner politischen Überzeugung. Man muss die Kräfte des Marktes sinnvoll nutzen und die Schwachen sozial schützen. Das erfordert auch Einschränkungen individueller Freiheit.“
&gt; Daraus wurde im Artikel: „Ich bin kein Liberaler.“
&gt; „Natürlich bejahe ich den Sozialstaat. Das hindert mich aber nicht, Missbrauch oder leistungsfeindliche Auswüchse zu kritisieren.“
&gt; 
&gt; „Frau von Storch hat keine Funktion in der AfD. Aber sie hat sich durch ihr Engagement in der Zivilen Koalition zu Recht hohes Ansehen erworben.“
&gt; 
&gt; „Ich begrüße es, dass sich Christen in der AfD in Arbeitskreisen organisieren. Das passt zu unserem Profil als werteorientierte Partei.“
&gt; 
&gt; „Für die Erziehung ist zunächst mal das Elternhaus verantwortlich. Die Schulen haben in erster Linie einen Bildungsauftrag.“
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Frau von Storch ergänzt:
&gt; 
&gt; „Ich habe mich nicht grundsätzlich gegen die allgemeine Schulpflicht geäußert. Ich bin aber gegen Denkverbote und habe daraufhin gewiesen, dass die Mehrzahl unserer europäischen Nachbarn statt der Schul- eine Bildungspflicht hat und damit sehr gute Erfahrungen haben. Die Überschrift „AfD kritisiert Rechte von Muslimen“ resultiert von meiner Aussage, ich sei unter Beachtung des Grundrechtes der Religionsfreiheit grundsätzlich für Volksentscheide, auch beim Bau von Moscheen.
&gt; Bei der AfD geht es weiterhin und zuvörderst um drei Themen: Den Euro und die gescheiterte Euro-Rettungspolitik, die EU, ihre Defizite an Demokratie, Subsidiarität und dem ständigen Bestreben nach Zentralisierung aller Macht und um Volksentscheide auf Bundesebene. Alles andere rangiert danach. Wenn wir in der Euro-Krise nicht bald umsteuern und die Krise lösen, gibt es für kein Politikfeld noch einen Handlungsspielraum.
&gt; 
&gt; Vor diesem Hintergrund ist der Bericht von Ankenbrand als tendenziös und mangelhaft recherchiert zurückzuweisen. Wir hätten uns gewünscht, dass der Autor seiner Pflicht zum objektiven Journalismus nachgekommen wäre. Dies hat er in diesem Artikel leider nicht getan.“",0,1394527494,null,0,false,0,cfzpgz2,t3_20320f,t1_cfzpgz2,t3_20320f,null,1432750157,7,false,de,t5_22i0,7

Furthermore...

&gt; Men polisens utredning ger, enligt flera oberoende källor, en annan bild än den som rapporterats om att knivbeväpnade nazister gått till oprovocerad attack mot en fredlig demonstration.
Innan blodbadet ska demonstranter på Möllevångstorget ha känt igen nazister i gruppen. Därefter har demonstranter sprungit mot nazisterna, uppger Kvällspostens källor. Polisen har däremot ännu inte fått några bekräftade uppgifter om att nazisterna i inledningsskedet attackerat eller uppträtt hotfullt mot demonstranterna.
Rusade mot nazisterna
Polisen ska i stället fått bilden, genom en mängd vittnesförhör med såväl personer i nazistgänget, demonstranter och poliser på plats, att en grupp på mellan 15 och 30 demonstranter rusade mot nazisterna, som försökte fly från platsen.
En av nazisterna uppges ha ramlat och skadat sig. När demonstranterna hann ikapp utanför Folkets park uppstod ett vilt slagsmål. Flera av nazisterna var knivbeväpnade och gick då till attack. Någon eller några av dem ska ha använt flaskor som tillhygge. Poliser som snabbt kom till platsen ska ha beskrivit situationen som kaotisk och extremt farlig.

Sì

&gt; Con quale frequenza?

Mah, certi giorni praticamente di continuo, se no di solito almeno una volta al giorno

&gt; In quali momenti?

Mattina, pomeriggio, sera, soprattutto quando non sto compiendo attività ma sono in uno stato di attesa/contemplativo

&gt; Vi spaventa l'idea? Cosa vi spaventa in particolare?

L'idea della morte in sè non mi spaventa, mi spaventano di più il dolore o la sofferenza, che sono caratteristiche intrinseche della vita e non della morte; mi spaventano le possibilità di morte violenta (tipo incidente d'auto)

Niente

No, non dopo aver letto *Tutti gli uomini sono mortali* di Simone de Beauvoir

From what I get, Germany didn't have intercity bus services at all and now that was changed? Am I correct? And what is the purpose of this question anyway besides wanting to know if a certain country had one and for how long?

I am quite surprised if intercity bus services in any country are limited. Unlike busses and roads, you just can't make up new lines and infrastructure that easy. And having a rail service costs a lot more then bus service does. Heck, I'm pretty sure anyone with a proper bus and permits, training and other needed bureaucracy related things can start ferrying passengers around in his own bus too. At least, that's the gist I get from Estonia, especially Tartu area. While a lot of busses do belong to Sebe or Go Bus (2 biggest companies in the area I know about), there are a lot of other smaller companies and routes too. Not to mention a dedicated free city line between 2 biggest shopping malls in the city.

As far as intercity goes, personally, I have not yet traveled with one but I hear it's good. TV, Wifi, student discounts on certain days during certain times, recently they even introduced some premium cards. And cheap too, but some foreign friends and relatives have said it has gone up (from 5 to 10 € to 20 or higher €).

&gt; The young man boards the bus as it leaves the terminal. He wears an overcoat. Beneath his overcoat, he is wearing a bomb. His pockets are filled with nails, ball bearings, and rat poison. The bus is crowded and headed for the heart of the city.

&gt; The young man takes his seat beside a middle-aged couple. He will wait for the bus to reach its next stop. The couple at his side appears to be shopping for a new refrigerator. The woman has decided on a model, but her husband worries that it will be too expensive. He indicates another one in a brochure that lies open on her lap. The next stop comes into view. The bus doors swing. The woman observes that the model her husband has selected will not fit in the space underneath their cabinets. New passengers have taken the last remaining seats and begun gathering in the aisle. The bus is now full. The young man smiles.With the press of a button he destroys himself, the couple at his side, and twenty others on the bus. The nails, ball bearings, and rat poison ensure further casualties on the street and in the surrounding cars. All has gone according to plan.

&gt; The young man’s parents soon learn of his fate. Although saddened to have lost a son, they feel tremendous pride at his accomplishment. They know that he has gone to heaven and prepared the way for them to follow. He has also sent his victims to hell for eternity. It is a double victory. The neighbors find the event a great cause for celebration and honor the young man’s parents by giving them gifts of food and money.

&gt; These are the facts. This is all we know for certain about the young man. Is there anything else that we can infer about him on the basis of his behavior? Was he popular in school? Was he rich or was he poor? Was he of low or high intelligence? His actions leave no clue at all. Did he have a college education? Did he have a bright future as a mechanical engineer? His behavior is simply mute on questions of this sort, and hundreds like them.  Why is it so easy, then, so trivially easy—you-could-almost-bet-your-life-on-it easy—to guess the young man’s religion?

It is a witch hunt if they're not guilty of the actions they are accused of, aka. trumped charges parroted over and over.

And when, eventually one might be ready... none is ready to compromise in relationship (the older we grow, the harder it is to change habits.. ) so money is there, education is there, one is ready... but now there is no ""a good"" partner.

1.3. Career: Both parents suppose to pursue career now... if you do not, you are ... weird/oldfashioned/sexist, whatever... But each child requires significant time sacrifice -&gt; impairment o career -&gt; inequality in chances and so on, and so forth 

1.4.  We grew to appreciate our good time too much and having a child does have an impairment on quality of life.

Another point though... the numbers OP is mentioning are averages.... but I guess if we would limit sample to people who willing, but for some reason ""choosing not to have"" kids... the story would be different.

Les sujets abordés par les législateurs sont techniques, c'est vrai. Par contre, le législateur ordinaire est à peu près aussi renseigné que le citoyen ordinaire. Les seuls élus développant une véritable expertise sont ceux siégeant durant des décennies dans les mêmes commissions... et encore, cela leur permet généralement d'avantager leurs copains à terme. Les élus ayant déjà une expertise (car c'est leur métier, par exemple) sont généralement rangés à un lobby ou emprunte le point de vue propre à leur classe sociale/leur métier. 

Franchement, je ne vois pas en quoi cela changerait grand' chose.

Surtout, penser à un système stochocrate permet de penser à un système où les postes à pouvoir sont dimensionnés pour des citoyens ordinaires. Personnellement, j'en ai marre d'avoir un Président-Roi. Je ne vois même pas pourquoi on en a un au XXIème siècle. J'en ai aussi marre d'avoir un Parlement aussi déconnecté du reste du pays.

Je ne suis pas sûr que des citoyens ordinaires tirés au sort auraient voté aussi aisément HADOPI, les récentes lois mettant sous surveillance constante la population ou même la loi de dépénalisation du droit des affaires. L'immense majorité des sujets traités par le Parlement sont déjà trop techniques pour eux, dès que l'on sort des sujets techniques propres à la comptabilité publique ou... aux lois, hyper-techniques, obèses et se multipliant à vue d’œil. Le député est devenu un professionnel de la politique produisant à la chaîne des lois déconnectées de leur application, et cela est contre-productif.

Après, il suffit de fréquenter un peu certaines ""élites"" pour se rendre compte qu'elles ne sont pas plus renseignées que le citoyen ordinaire sur beaucoup de sujets cruciaux. Si nos élus et leurs assistants étaient si éclairés, le pays ne serait pas dans son état actuel.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"Well there are three main reasons why it's offensive, other than the offense to historical accuracy :

* Cowardice and weakness are largely among the most detested flaws a person can have. I don't mind other French stereotypes, like that we're rude, dirty or whatnot. Those are harmless and can be funny. They're on par with the level of offense of most other national stereotypes, like Americans being fat and stupid. They're comparatively not as insulting as cowardly and weak.

* Most French people have family members, or recent ancestors who have fought and died in recent wars. My grandfather fought in the trenches in WW1 (my father was old when he had me.. he was 50), and he won a medal for bravery. He met my Belgian grandmother when he was stationed there after the war. My uncle was a pilot in WW2, and died in the initial German invasion. My father fought in Algeria. Wars are a large part of recent family histories in France, be it the World Wars, Indochina, Algeria - back when there was compulsory military service. There are only a few (maybe half a dozen) French towns which don't have a monument to those who died in 20th century wars. Everyone understands that an American can feel proud or protective of his family's military history, in WW2, or Vietnam.. Well, here's a scoop : it's the same in France. So it's quite hurtful that our families who suffered during those wars are insulted by some jackass behind his computer.

* Much of the time, the joke is spread through actual, genuine anti-French sentiment. The joke took off largely during a hate fueled rage against France. So very often, when the stereotype is mentioned, it is meant as a direct insult. 

Otherwise, I do find it ridiculous when a European from a country with a less impressive military history than France jumps in the bandwagon and uses the joke. I've seen Norwegians, Belgians, Czechs, and Slovenians, for God's sake, jump in the American bandwagon like that. Very disappointing. They should know better. 

Also, it seems every time France is mentioned in an international forum, there has to be at least one ""surrender monkey"" joke comment. It gets really annoying. When a post on France is on the front page of Reddit, I know with absolute certainty that I'll find that joke in the comment section.

We're going full retard here in the UK. Nuclear power plants are a great candidate for a nationalized industry. They're a hideously expensive but completely necessary thing..

That's what the government are generally good at. 

Instead we agreed a strike price of £92.50 per MWh which is over twice the current market rate. 

Will the government make up the difference if the market rate is lower than that when they go into operation? No. We'll just spend more on electricity. 

So the current gamble the government have played is that electricity prices will more than double in 10 years.

Inflation alone should take the cost of electricity up to £60 from £45.. 

It could work out great, but it's a risk. Might have been safer to just take out some loans and get building.

Non ho domande da proporre ma una considerazione.

Trovo che la vita, in generale, come la conosciamo, e' una vera e propria sfida, considerato che alla luce delle informazioni di cui disponiamo, la stragrande maggioranza dell'universo e' ostile alla vita. Non ho tendenze new age o spirituali, per cui non lego alla vita una sensazione di preziosita' assoluta, o di sacralita'. E' una cosa debole che ha impiegato diverso tempo ad emergere e si puo' estinguere con facilita', per questo tendo a proteggerla quando possibile. Oltre a questo pero', a volte mi balocco con l'idea che la nostra coscienza di noi stessi esista in quanto parte di un tentativo dell'universo di capire se' stesso, e quindi che ognuno di noi sia all'interno di una specie di esperimento improvvisato per arrivare a poco a poco a una qualche risposta. Sempre che ci si arrivi. Tratto da una delle mie serie TV preferite, Babylon 5, episodio 3x04 (non ci sono spoiler):

""[I]f I project a beam of light at the wall, you see the light on the wall, but the wall is not the source of the light. It comes in from somewhere else. The soul is also a projection. It does not exist inside us, any more than the light exists inside the wall, but this shell is the only way we can perceive it.""  
""We believe that the universe itself is conscious in a way we can never truly understand. It is engaged in a search for meaning, so it breaks itself apart, investing its own consciousness in every form of life. We are the universe, trying to understand itself.""

Wer brauch schon OECD-Studien mit knapp 2 Millionen Teilnehmern?!

Alles falsche Werte. Wieso fragen wir nicht lieber /u/leenucks !

So, und jz hörst du mir mal zu, damits endlich in deine Birne passt:

Die 22% sind faktisch der UNBEREINIGTE Gehaltsunterschied.

Je nach Studie findest du jetzt eine BEREINIGTE Angabe, bei der zB Mutterschaft und so weiter **schon abgerechnet** ist.

Die OECD hat mit 7-8% die höchste Angabe dieser Prozentangabe, die *angeblich* die direkte Diskriminierung NUR durch das bloße Geschlecht beziffern soll. (Zum vergleich: Niedrigste seriöse Angabe ist 2%)

Das ist natürlich Unsinn so rumzurechnen und das ganze konkret zu beziffern. Der Wert wird irgendwo im einstelligen, niedrigen Prozentberreich liegen.

Und deshalb nochmal den Sinn des GPG erklärt, der verdammte Kacke nochmal nicht einmal diese abstrakte direkte Diskriminierung ist:

Das is Teil eines soziologischen Wissenschaftsfeldes, das Systemvariablen sucht, die diese 23-8%=15% indirekte Ungerechtigkeit induzieren:

""Die unbereinigte Zahl bildet die gesamte Ursachenkette für das Entstehen der Lohnlücke ab. Für rund zwei Drittel des Gender Pay Gap lassen sich die Ursachen rechnerisch genau bestimmen."" (http://www.equalpayday.de/statistik/ )

Die restlichen angeblichen 8% stellen die unerklärliche Einkommensdifferenz da, wo also Mutterschaft schon soweit abgezogen ist.

Soviel zur Heise-Überschrift dann.

**Edit:**

Die Mutterschaft ist bei den 8% des Statistischen Bundesamtes **nicht!** abgerechnet, sondern in andern Studien.

Soll heißen, nachdem man soweit wirklich alle verzerrenden Faktoren auch noch aus dem bereinigten GPG rausrechnet, kommt man auf ca. 2-4% **je nach Grad der Berufsuntätigkeit** und ""Zerstückelung"" der Berufszeiten bei Frauen. (siehe zb IW Köln)

Notes:

As usual, Portugal is going to ""cheat"" the 2020 target by abusing Big Hydro (predicted +8000MW total by 2017) and completely ignore the other renewables.

EDIT: In total the share of the energies is as follows:

- 26,3% Big Hydro,
- 24,6% Regular Regime non-renewables(gas, coal, diesel, etc),
- 23,2% Wind (thank 2013's bad weather for that),
- 11,6% Special regime non-renewables(I don't know what the heck is this),
- 5,5% Imports (thanks Spain and France nuclear),
- 5,3% Biomass,

- 0,9% Solar (Portugal has very low sunlight, secure sources write)

Starting a federal union inside the EU. Say, two countries which get along well, become one federal country inside the EU. Then progressively, neighboring countries are invited to join. Preferably, this should start with some of the more influential EU countries, ie two of the original 6 founding members, or any large Western European countries. That would encourage neighbors to join the ""new thing"".

Another possibility, is that there are multiple federal unions inside the EU. Those federal unions would regroup similar countries, politically and culturally, thus making it less shocking to the citizens at being ruled by a supranational entity. The most obvious supranational entity would be the Scandinavian union, which I think could work. Others may be harder to create, but I think it could be done eventually. Having sub-unions within the Union would have the advantage of reducing division in the EU, from 28 differing opinions to at least half that number.

Die Frage ist welche Einwanderung wollen wir in Zukunft?

Durch die EU-Freizügigkeit geht es so oder so ausschließtlich nur um Nicht-EU-Einwanderer. Und bei diesen würde ich ein Punktesystem bevorzugen.
Deutschland wird wie die meisten ""westlichen"" Länder bis zu einem gewissen Grad ein Einwanderungsland sein, aber wir müssen darauf achten das wir Einwanderer ""erhalten"" die dem Land auch nützen. Die Herkunft sollte keine Rolle spielen, aber die Qualifikation. Es sollte z.B. eine Selbstverständlichkeit sein das Einwanderer *vor* der Einwanderung nach Deutschland auf einem gewissen Level Deutsch sprechen können. Dies hilft nicht nur der ""Aufnahmegesellschaft"" sondern eben auch den Einwanderern selbst, ohne Sprache geht auch gesellschaftlich gar nichts.

Den ""Familiennachzug"" in seiner derzeitigen Form z.B. sehe ich sehr kritisch da er Probleme verfestigt.

Das Asylrecht ist ein vollkommen anderes Problem.

Wer ernsthaft verfolgt ist muss in Deutschland *immer* Zuflucht finden können.
Wenn Asyl nicht berechtigt oder von vornherein versucht wird den Staat auszutricksen (""verschwinden"" der Pässe) muss eine schnelle Rückführung geschehen.
Jahrelange Wartezeiten in Heimen helfen niemanden.

Außerdem sollten Asylbewerber bei denen es auf berechtigtes Asyl hinausläuft in Deutschland arbeiten dürfen. Das Menschen über Jahre ""bei der Stange gehalten"" werden und nicht arbeiten dürfen ist kontraproduktiv.

Desweiteren bin der Meinung das Asylbewerber dezentral untergebracht werden sollten, vorallem im ländlichen Raum. Aber die Ausführung wäre für den Kommentar jetzt etwas zu lang.

Let's check the list of characteristics of fascism:

A. Ideology and Goals:

- Espousal of an idealist, vitalist, and voluntaristic philosophy, normally involving the attempt to realize a new modern, self-determined, and secular culture

- Creation of a **new nationalist authoritarian state** not based on traditional principles or models

- Organization of a new highly regulated, multiclass, integrated national economic structure, whether called national corporatist, national socialist, or national syndicalist

- **Positive evaluation and use of, or willingness to use violence and war**

- **The goal of empire, expansion, or a radical change in the nation's relationship with other powers**

B. The Fascist Negations:

- **Antiliberalism**

- Anticommunism

- Anticonservatism

C. Style and Organization:

- Attempted mass mobilization with **militarization** of political relationships and style and with the goal of a mass single party militia""

- Emphasis on aesthetic structure of meetings, symbols, and political liturgy, stressing emotional and mystical aspects

- Extreme stress on the **masculine** principle and male dominance, while espousing a strongly organic view of society

- Exaltation of youth above other phases of life, emphasizing the conflict of the generations, at least in effecting the initial political transformation

- **Specific tendency toward an authoritarian, charismatic, personal style of command, whether or not the command is to some degree initially elective**

Wenn ich meine Wahlentscheidung nach Lobbymitgliedschaften der Parteimitglieder treffe darf ich niemanden mehr wählen. Ich wähle nach Programm. Ich finde die Diskussion über Lobbyismus meistens ziemlich scheinheilig. Einige führende Mitglieder der Grünen und der SPD sind in Lobbygruppen der ""erneubaren Energien"", z.B. der Windkraftindustrie. Auch dort geht es nur ums Geld.

True, but at least in The Netherlands that's not even the principal concern. The problem is that sending your child/baby to daycare is enormously expensive, and that's partly caused by your point 1.3; Everyone works and as such there's a much higher demand than there is space.

Another problem lies in the educational setting for children. If I'd have kids (I don't, but I want to eventually) I'd have to register them for a primary school *before the child is born*. That is insane. The same goes for daycare btw.

  She wishes to have children one day, I can't really think about it for now. We can barely afford to live as it is,so getting children anytime soon is the least of my concerns. The whole situation left me depressed and anxious to be honest, I'm without income right now because my student funds were cut because I'm too old. The money in my bank account that I saved up is the last I have and I'm desperately looking for a job but it's ridiculously hard to find anything if you don't have connections. Most of the time people don't even respond to your application or they're flooded so much it takes them weeks to tell you they picked somebody else. If I look into the job offerings it's all gastronomy with years of experience, retail work with years of experience, shady multi-leveling marketing shit, entry level jobs for certain degrees (like doctors looking for receptionists working on a medical degree).

As to eastern states fear, let me paint a picture of how real it is. I live in Romania. Near us to the east lies Moldova, the second Romanian state. Moldova is a part of the historical province with the same name (the other half which resides in Romanian borders is also. naturally called Moldova). It has been anexed in 1940 by the soviets which proceeded with an accelerated russification of this territory. Presently they have a significant Russian minority. With the same tactics the Russian have started a separatist conflict on the Estern border in Transnistria  where there are more Russians. Romania hopes that sometimes in the future the two states would unite similar to the German model. The roadmap for this as Romania is integrated in Western structures would, at first be , Moldova's EU ascension. And this year Moldova managed to sign, as Ukraine was preparing to, the EU Trade Agreeement. This was received by the Russians with the same approach as it has been in Ukraine. The deal went through, but in light of the recent events I don't think they will let it slide. They are just momentarily preoccupied with Ukraine. They can always ignite the frozen conflict in Transnistria, which will make EU ascension impossible. A lot of Moldova's citizens are also Romanian citizens by birthright and by blood right . So you see how Russian actions has an impact on EU citizens, and plans directly.

It's hard for people in countries that had not deal with the Russians to understand what a plague they've been and why a lot of the Eastern Bloc is allergic and paranoid about them..

The whole point of ""allowed to vote if citizen"" is based on the common assumption that if you're a citizen then you also live or have a vested interest in a certain region and it was designed to allow people influence over regional decisions that affect them. However, we live in a globalising world and the premise is changing. Not only are people able to move out of their native territory leaving little interests behind, but furthermore, regional governments are heavily influenced by outside powers - as such the decision to allow all and only citizen to vote is slowly losing its purpose.

I personally believe we should look back at the original purpose - that is, people should be able to vote if they have a legitimate stake in the referred territory.

The main reason is, indeed, because Europe is a post industrial society. Having kids isn't a necessity, and women have careers to take care of.

This is why the US has a renewed population for example, but white-Americans, born in the US, have birth rates just as low as the average European. After a couple generations, immigrant families start having just as few kids as the native populations.

Culture does have an impact, however. The Mormons in the US, for example, have a high birthrate for white Americans. Israel has a high birth rate as well. Those are exceptions. ",0,1394540108,null,0,1394540362,0,cfzrhcc,t3_204i6i,t1_cfzrhcc,t1_cfzqq7f,null,1432751107,60,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,60

I disagree. 

&gt;At least in Australia's case, there are limits for postal voting where you have to intend to move back to Australia within 6 years, but there is no proof required of this, nor do you have to follow through with it in which case it becomes unethical if you have no intention to move back.

It must be remembered that most EU member states have a larger diaspora than Australia and many offer citizenship through descent.

Let's take my country, Ireland, as an example. Paddy Reilly moved to Boston in the fifties. He married and had four kids. His four kids married and had two kids themselves. So one natural born citizen emigrated and we have twelve more citizens through descent. It is estimated that up to one million American citizens in New York and New England alone can obtain Irish citizenship. Factor in the diaspora in the rest of North America, Australia, the UK, the rest of Europe and we are talking millions. If we allowed them vote through a postal system, they would have a bigger say in running the country than people who actually live here. A lot of them would look back at the 'old country' misty eyed and full of romantic notions. They would vote for Republicans. No fucking way would I want them having a say in how the country is run.

Nope. Russians don't care about heritage. They ruined way to many historic buildings in old Moscow center, they don't have photos of Russian Empire, they only use history as propaganda tool and to prise themselves while drinking vodka.

&gt;Is it taught as the beginning of both Ukrainian and Russian civilizations, or just one of the two?

It is taught that Kiev was capital (prestol, stolniy grad) of huge old Slavic state which collapsed into separate ones ruled by different lords. At some point one state built an empire and conquered others and now claiming old capital as their own province.

&gt;Is this fodder for Ukrainians who want to be part of Russia?

Nope. Most of these people are Russians who deny existence of Ukrainian ethnicity and people with nostalgia for old soviet times.
Also some people believe that Russian would simply feed them money, that Russia is some sort of sibling state, while Europe is something alien with different culture.

Also many people still think in terms of USSR vs West with West meaning America and completely ignoring the fact that Europe itself have different states with different laws, culture and many of them are Slavic as well and far more close to Ukraine than Russia.",0,1394540700,null,0,1394541179,0,cfzrly8,t3_202d3j,t1_cfzrly8,t1_cfzquvx,null,1432751165,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Grundsätzlich richtig und bedenkenswert - die Demokratie hat sich  in griechischen Stadtstaaten entwickelt, wo die Partizipation aller Bürger an Verwaltung, Gesetzgebung und Rechtsprechung tatsächlich noch möglich war.

&gt;Bei x-verschiedenen Sprachen (es werden noch mehr neue Mitgliedsstaaten dazukommen) ist eine für eine freiheitliche Demokratie nötige politische Diskussion und Teilhabe garnicht möglich. Dies ist nur in einer gewohnten, in einer Muttersprache möglich.

Aber ich würde das wesentliche Problem einer europaweiten Volksvertretung nicht unbedingt an der Sprachenvielfalt festmachen:

Distanz und Komplexität sind m.M. nach das größere Problem.

Stell dir vor, ein finnischer Abgeordneter muß sich mit Korruptionsproblemen bei Fördermitteln für den spanischen Olivenanbau beschäftigen. Oder ein irischer MEP hat sich im Verkehrsausschuss mit den hohen Unfallzahlen im Baltikum zu beschäftigen.

Wo sollen sie sich ohne Kenntnis der örtlichen Sprache, Kultur, politischen und wirtschaftlichen Verhältnissen, landeseigener Gesetzgebung, öffentlicher Meinung etc.  informieren, um angemessene Entscheidungen zu treffen?

Es ist zu befürchten, daß sie, schon aus Zeitmangel, sich weitgehend auf die offizielle Vorlagen der EU zum Thema beschränken, ggf. mit Anweisungen aus ihrer Fraktion. 

Da ihre Wiederwahl nicht von der Qualität ihrer Arbeit in anderen als den eigenen Ländern abhängt, gibt es auch kaum Sanktionsmöglichkeiten gegen uninformierte Entscheidungen. Die von eventuellen Dummheiten betroffenen Balten wählen ja nicht in Irland…

And also cost more because children require specific infrastructure (from playgrounds/kindergartens/schools to paid maternity leave and other healthcare costs...).
Either only parents should provide for all of this and receive pension dependent on the number of their children, or everyone should have the same pension because everyone pays the same taxes regardless of their parent status.

Afaik the French write Israël or noël to show it's Is-ra-el or no-el.

It would make sense to also write Israël in German, to indicate that it is Isra-el and not Isräl (since ae would be an Umlaut). But trema aren't used in German, since they don't occur in the German language and almost not in English.

That is certainly not the case where I live, not anymore, not for some time now.

Not even the people who are retired now can live off their pension (1/3 of them has income below the poverty line, on average monthly pension is 300 eur or less than 40% of average salary and less than minimum wage).  

So the younger generations have no such illusions, especially with youth unemployment being over 50% (for the 15-24 age group, overall it is 21,9% where 45% of all unemployed is between 15 and 34 y.o.).

We can justify it with his good services and the good sides to it, but it escapes the fact that its both a failure of meritocracy in industry and a mis-use of the whole machinery of government to subvert it in favour of one particular industry, Its also a failure of the free market if corruption is whats getting companies ahead. 

It may or may not be that bad in Mr Schröders case, like I say I dont know enough to comment. But It is corruption even if people only think the government aren't entirely above board. And it is exactly the same in Japan where you talk about, and the consequences of this type of lax attitude to corruption are evident in the Olympus Scandal in Japan. We also see the consequences of this in the failures of banking regulation due to Revolving door employment between regulator and industry. 

Like I say, I dont care about Mr Schröder in specific, but I do care when we say that its inevitable, because a) its not inevitable b) in the long run it costs us financially, socially and morally more than what we gain by not rocking the boat.

Da werden u.a. solche ""Lösungsansätze"" wohl offen diskutiert). Der Shitstorm der dem folgte lies das Thema in den Hintergrund gleiten. Das was geblieben ist sind (für Wirtschaftswissenschaftler) sehr unrealistische Ausstiegsszenarien inkl. der fehlenden Erklärungen wie man die Schäden die für Deutschland entstehen würden begleichen wolle und eine meist eher oberflächliche Kritik an allem was irgendwie nach Regulierung (ist ja in letzter Zeit meist Regulierung durch die EU, was das viel einfacher macht. Siehe z.B. Bankenunion) riecht.

So you admit that Daiichi had inadequate safety measures.  Then why was it allowed to continue operation long after this was understood (see article further down)?

&gt; The 10 year younger Fukushima Daini was hit by the same natural disaster and barely made any headlines as it turned off as planned.

Your statement is as true as it is irrelevant because you gloss over the reason for *why* Daini shut down as planned: Was it because the regulation worked properly or was it due to sheer luck?  If the regulatory body failed to ensure the safe operation of the older plant, why should anyone heed their expertise on the newer ones?

&gt; There is no conspiracy here.

[Of course not](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/world/asia/17japan.html?_r=0).

BTW: It is intellectually dishonest to a) put words in my mouth and b) call something a conspiracy which was nothing more than a mix between regulatory capture, corruption, and national economic interest at the expense of individual safety – which is exactly my point.

&gt; If there was, the newer plant should have had even lower safety margins, which was demonstrably not the case.

Once again you leave out the question of whether that was due to the safety standards being sound or due to luck.  Maybe it only worked because it had ten years of wear and tear less.

true,mucco,trentino,,"First and foremost: this is all my personal opinion and some people may disagree a lot. Torino has two universities, which are very different from each other.

Università di Torino (unito.it) is very par for the course as far as italian universities go: mostly good education level paired with huge inefficiencies that severely hinder the academic career in some cases. As far as I know, Unito covers almost all of the possible academic careers, ranging from literature to mathematics and law.

The other, Politecnico di Torino (polito.it), is a technical school much like the american MIT. It ranks among the very best universities in Italy, mostly thanks to huge private investments by international companies. It offers study courses in all branches of engineering as well as architecture. It is especially excellent in automotive, aerospace, and computer engineering (which is closer to computer science than the US ""computer engineering"" degree).

Unito, as far as I know, has limited access to English language classes, while Polito has pushed very hard in this direction for the past few years and as a result a high percentage of the classes are available in English as well. The quality of the English language in these classes will vary (in both places) from fair to abysmal and it might very well happen that teachers say ""fuck it"" and finish lectures in Italian when they can't explain themselves properly.

Unito is a lively university with several different locations spread around the city center; personally speaking, it has a strong ""university"" feel where there are a lot of people together all the time, you get to know many different and interesting people, etc. Polito is way more calm and serious feeling, also due to the big gender imbalance (might be 80/20) and to the high percentage of nerds and geeks. There are also a lot of foreigners and southern italians creating many sub-groups which do not really intermingle a lot, really.

As far as the system goes, it's pretty simple: you pick a major and you complete a 3-year BD course (Laurea Triennale) in which you will have to pass exams for a combined value of 180 ""credits"". You can then (strongly advised) go on to the MD (Laurea Magistrale/Specialistica), which requires further 120 ""credits"" or two years' worth of exams. Unito allows great freedom in choosing your exams, while Polito is very very strict and you'll be lucky to pick two exams per year out of a shortlist.

Exam marks in Italy go from 1 to 30, where 18 is the minimum ""pass"" mark. An especially good performance will earn you a ""magna cum laude"" award along with the 30; this will be reflected in the final degree grade, which is given based on the exams' average as well as your performance in the final thesis, and which is expressed in a value up to 110 - and you can earn the ""magna cum laude"" here, too.

I think it is very unlikely that either school will recognize all of your efforts in the USA; it is possible that they will accept a few of your exams, ignore some, and require you to pass a verification test for the remainder. Then you'll be assigned a certain amount of ""credits"" and you'll move on from there.

true,VincentClebard,ZZZZZZchiot,Chiot,"*Mon parcours, ma position sociale*

Je viens d'une filière ""qui recrute""... au passé ! J'ai été diplômé l'année de la crise (2009) durant laquelle toutes les embauches étaient figées. Ce fut le début, pour ma génération de diplômés, de départs massifs à l'étranger.

Je me suis acharné à rester en France, et j'ai désormais une situation relativement stable (CDI, paye sympa) sur le plan professionnel. Pendant longtemps, j'étais le seul membre d'une ""classe moyenne"" dans mon entourage ; entre les RSAistes/chômeurs/galériens et les salariés bien payés pour leur âge et pour l'époque. 

Finalement, j'ai rejoint très récemment la seconde catégorie, au moment où j'hésitais d'ailleurs à partir (refus de stagner). Ce fut exceptionnel, selon mon entourage et même mes supérieurs hiérarchiques, que l'on puisse ainsi m'accorder de nouvelles opportunités, une belle augmentation, etc. dans la même boîte. Depuis, je pars du principe que ce n'est que temporaire, tant cela me semble improbable.

Je ne connais quasiment plus d'entre-deux au niveau social. Les seuls galériens que je vois vivre correctement ont des soutiens de leurs parents (capitaux, propriété/logement, etc) ou vivent dans des zones à très bas coût de la vie. Et pour la classe des ""aisés"", nous sommes sûrement deux fois moins avantagés que nos aînés au même âge. 

Cela fait des années que les jeunes fuient ! La grosse différence, c'est que les gosses de bourgeois, grands-écoliers, Science Po, etc. commencent eux aussi à galérer en France, acceptent des salaires plus bas, se sentent moins à l'aise, etc. 

Donc les médias en parlent. Alors que le taux de chômage à deux chiffres des jeunes ne date pas d'hier. Sauf que maintenant, des types sortant d'école de commerce se plaignent de leur salaire ou des difficultés à trouver un job. Des mecs ayant fait une grande école se retrouvent au chômage à 35 ans et découvrent qu'ils étaient sur-payés. Des enfants de bourgeois s'étonnent de ne pas avoir les mêmes opportunités que leurs parents à niveau de diplôme équivalent. Les jeunes cadres dans la finance et le conseil ont bien moins d'avantages que leurs aînés quelques années/décennies auparavant.

A l'étranger, il y a de tout dans mon entourage. Avec exactement le même diplôme que le mien, une de mes amies est devenue consultante ""internationale"", se baladant de pays en pays pour participer à des projets concernant des centaines de personnes. Un autre (même diplôme) est devenu manager dans les jeux vidéo dans un pays d'Asie du sud-est. 

A noter qu'ils bossent comme des fous furieux. 

Sans donner plus d'infos personnelles : malgré une paye plus que correcte, je ne suis pas manager, sait parfaitement que l'évolution dans mon job sera soit trèèès lente, soit inexistante. Et je crois être dans le haut du panier en termes de salaire parmi mes anciens camarades ; mais je travaille à Paris (salaires plus élevés, mais loyers démentiels -je vis en banlieue-).

*Ce qui me fait rester en France ?*

Ma petite amie est étudiante. Mon boulot est cool sans être exceptionnel. J'ai atteint un niveau de revenu qui me convient. Je ne suis pas carriériste et j'accorde beaucoup d'importance à mes projets personnels et ma vie sentimentale.

Daiichi hat a construction error that Daini doesn't have: the backup Diesel generators are not placed in an area that is easily inundated.

To elaborate on this, here's some copypasta of an earlier post of mine:

&gt; For me, the issue is not neccessarily worries about exploding nuclear power plants, but what to do with the nuclear waste. There have already been [huge problems with the disposal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schacht_Asse_II) in Germany in the past, and despite decades of fission-based power plants nobody has figured out yet where to permanently dispose of it [\(although the search has been going on for decades as well\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorleben_salt_dome). Germany is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. I have doubts that other nations have less problems with this issue. The thing is, a solution for final disposal of nuclear waste has to bear up for at least a couple of thousands of years. Imagine there had been nuclear power plants in the bronze age. I don't think these would have been maintained for that long. Consider that what we do now will have consequences for many, many generations.

Just imagine wars break out in the centuries to come - not really unthinkable, is it? Who would guarantee for the maintenance of said disposal sites?

When we moved to our current house in 2001, the house was in a very poor state. The boiler was an old monstrosity, nearly all the beams for the roof were rotten and it was surprising that it was still standing (there were tiles missing as well).

We had the whole house rewired and repiped, along with fixing up the roof and the windows upstairs (they were old iron-framed single-glazed windows from the industrial revolution) and putting oak flooring down and proper doors (oak). The walls were all solid, even the inside ones. The wires are encased in a metal tubing and then it was plaster over, so basically, from the outside, you've got the outside render - then stone - then plaster on the inside.

The house is much better, efficiency-wise since we've done these improvements. Especially new windows and fixing up the chimneys, it's amazing. In the summer, the old part of the house is very cool because of this, but in winter it doesn't retain the heat well. As I said, recent work over winter has improved it quite a bit.

Okay, I might be able to say diffrence between Slovak and Czech, because I understand more from Slovak.

However, that school gives you chances to build connections with important people in the industry who could find you a job after that.

&gt; EU already has a joint command structure a-la NATO 

Which is strictly defensive more than anything else and is largely dominated by the US, Britain, and France. Which is great for them but not for other member countries who may wish to prosecute their own interests. So either you need arrangements that either complement NATO or replace it outright.

&gt; As for US spending, it does it because it wants to, not because it has to

The US *wants* to remain relevant on the world stage. In order to do that it needs to project power but even then there are limits to that. For example, those supersized carriers are of no use in the Black Sea.

&gt; I don't think that the US has any interest in the EU becoming a superpower

The EU will never be a ""superpower"" in its own right. Many of its constituent countries are (or may become) *great* powers, but that's it. They won't magically coalesce into some massive superstate overnight. And even if they were they would never really be in *opposition* to American interests, due to both geographic location, economic interdependence and shared values/culture.

&gt; It has nothing to do with what I care or don't care about

That is not the point. By ""countries we care about,"" obviously I mean NATO. After all it is a binding defensive pact by definition, and we would not pledge to defend NATO countries if we did not care about them. Anyway, invading a sovereign country is politically unacceptable. If we are not even really willing to impose sanctions over it, we are basically giving them a blank check to invade whomever they feel like for whatever reason, or create another one of those absurd ""frozen conflicts"" in order to keep countries perpetually unstable.

&gt;but anyone with an ounce of sense or military experience knows that starting a land war with Russia is insane.

Not if it's on the defensive. Nobody is talking about sending tanks towards Moscow.

&gt; This means that Putin is looking for an off-ramp and a mutually acceptable one is to allow Crimea to have its referendum, have international observers ensure that it's free and fair, then respect it.

They don't. Most of them are integrated. If they were even half as bad as you make them out, our society would have been in ruins decades ago. You read stuff on the internet. Yet many of your neighbors are most likely Muslims. Ordinary people. Just like Christians.

&gt; You are ignorant. You are proud of your ignorance. I am done with you.

&gt; You're so ignorant you think that Rush Limbaugh started talk radio...

Why would you mention Limbaugh in this discussion?

&gt; Free Speech to demand the suppression of Free Speech by claiming damned near anything is an insult. 

People do this everyday. NPD wants to end the free world. Christians get butthurt all the time and use Free Speech in order to be against it. Yes there are individual idiots from all walks of live and all religions. There isn't any reason to say that Muslims may be more or less at fault here than Christians. 

Get me a single, no nonsense, practical example of someone using ""freedom against freedom"" stuff that is not about ""Free Speech"". Even in a theorectical sense freedom only works as freedom. You can't protect your preciouse freedom by making the world less free in order to protect it. There is only more or less freedom. So by throwing Muslims in jail for thought crimes or speech crimes or hate speech or whatever, you limit freedom itself.

The most backwards ass Muslim countries that are really deplorable are Kuweit, Baharain and Saudi Arabia. They finance radical Muslim groups all over the world. In Christianity we have the household regular church next door and then we have those missionaries and new churches going around with bible study shit. Same with Muslims. And who finances the radical guys? Our guys. Because Saudi Arabia, Kuweit and Baharain are protected by the West. In order to get their oil. Without our decades of support, these backwards places wouldn't exist. When Saddam finally had enough in 1990 and threatened to tear down the kindom (yea, that backwards) of Saudi Arabia, we came to their rescue. So they could lead on their way of live of the 1500s. 

We in Europe went through the Enlightenment. And then we had christian Hitler. Nothing any Muslim ever did or even attempted comes close to what European powers did in the first half of the 20th century. Nothing. You don't even need any religion to do horrible stuff. 

And religion is replaceable. Just ask Kony and his Lords Resistant Army. Devout Christians using child soldiers to terrorize a country for decades. Or how about Liberia? All Christians. In India Muslims and Hindus are killing each other. The Muslims must be the bad guys, right? Because? Well because they are Muslim. And you have somehow proven (copypasta some more?) that Islam is the root of all evil. Too bad they bodycount pales in comparison to Colonization, the World Wars, and so on and so forth. And we keep piling it up. Look at the war in Iraq. When it comes to the body count, the conflict in and around Israel also has a clear result. But maybe it's not the amount of people you kill, that determines how evil you are? Maybe it is the amount of people you think you want to kill? Thoughtcrime again?

Your excuses don't matter. Wether you are Muslims and try to use it as an excuse to blow up people or condemn your Muslims neighbors for what some asshat is doing thousand miles ago, because he says he is doing it for Islam.

This may be difficult to do considering any historic personality will be more associated to some countries than to the others, and he'll need to be a peaceful figure, because if not he likely fought against another European country... I was thinking someone like Victor Hugo, who represents a lot of the EU's ideals, and also was one of the first to dream and write about the united states of Europe. However, as you know, Hugo was French, thus other nationalities may feel left out. Then again, I remember reading a study about the designs of the Euro bills. It turns out most Europeans would have preferred that the bills had pictures of real monuments representative of Europe, like the Eiffel Tower, even though it's not a monument in their country, and even though it's likely not every eurozone country could get a national monument represented on the currency. 

Anyway, if we can't get a transnational European hero, maybe we can think of something else to reinforce EU unity and pride. I'm thinking of a pet project. One of the most potent ones would be funding ESA, and aiming for a high visibility space exploration project, and planting that EU flag somewhere.

Falsch angewendet birgt homeschooling eben ein unerschöpfliches Missbrauchs- und Gefahrenpotential. Die Deregulierung der Bildung ist einfach viel zu riskant. Wird doch eh missbraucht werden.

Auch wenn wenigstens seriöses homeschooling angeblich sehr viel effizienter ist, so hat die Schule auch eine kleine Reihe von Vorteilen.

Die Sozialisierung, der geregelte Tagesablauf und allgemein die geregelte Bildung die ja so schon more or less Sinn macht. (Wobei ich schon natürlich schon gerne die eine oder andere Bildungsreform hätte)

Tiefer werde Ich jetzt nicht gehen, weil Ich kein studierter Pädagoge bin und mich das Thema grad gar nicht interessiert und zum ins Fachwissen einlesen animiert.

Das Missbrauchsargument ist mir eh genug, um homeschooling abzulehnen und die angebliche Effizienz des ordentlichen homeschoolings kann die normale Schule meiner Meinung nach bei ausreichendem Etat und Reformierung auch erlangen.

I'd also fear that growing exclusively a few select kind of tree could be damaging to the earth, but a rotation system of what you grow could probably prevent that.

In a biodiversity perspective however it's the most boring forest possible. This can sound trivial and insignificant, but lots of people use forests as a place you can visit, and animals use it as a place living. The very homogeneous forest would be a like a field of trees, rather than a forest.

Of course other good (and economical sound) alternatives can be really hard to get by, and using wood can be an easy solution, but I don't think it's going to hold up in the long run, I think the demand for more energy rises too quickly for foresting to be able to keep up.

Regarding ethanol it seems like a great way to produce CO2 neutral gas for cars, since regular combustion engines can use it without any change. At least up to about 25% ethanol in the regular gas, then the solution gets too acidic for the engine. But as far as I know, it's solvable with a relatively cheep (less than a thousand dollar a car) upgrade of the engines. I'd guess it's about coating some parts, but I honestly don't know about the specifics.

Ethanol is something most countries can produce from crops in one way or another, but I don't think there is political will behind it in EU, since we have a law that no more than 5% of crops area can be dedicated to producing bio-ethanol.

Wrong. The constitutional process was not followed in the removal of Yanukovych, hence why he and Russia claim he is still the legitimate president. Since the rest of the government can not be confirmed without the presidential approval, it too is currently not constitutional.

To impeach the Ukrainian president, the parliament needs a 3/4th majority (338 MPs) and a review by the Constitutional Court. When Yanukovych was ousted, a mere 328 MPs voted in favor and no Constitutional Court review was asked or delivered.

Thus, according to the Ukrainian constitution, the current government is illegitimate.

So I guess a good policy would be to build reactors where, if they went Chernobyl, you wouldn't have to abandon anything like a whole metropolis.

&gt;The problem is that such risks can not be quantified.

It's strange that the consequences from fossil fuels can be quantified (asthma, cancer, acid rain, global warming, etc) and yet we still use them. I don't think that being able to quantify the risks has anything to do with it, since we choose to do things that are quantifiably killing us and the planet (which seems to me as the most horrible thing we could choose to do). Even though there are dangers, I think ultimately the response to nuclear power is a knee-jerk response by our primitively-wired psyche and does not come from reason. It's a shame the use of fossil fuels doesn't evoke the same response, it could have saved us the trouble of going down this path. 

James Lovelock explains this eloquently. In *The Revenge of Gaia*, he writes:

&gt;One of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife. This is true of the land around Chernobyl, the bomb test sites of the Pacific, and areas near the United States' Savannah River nuclear weapons plant of the Second World War. Wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous, and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets...

In my opinion it shouldn't have to come to violence for even a unilateral bid for independence to be justified. I *do* think there should be a fairly high bar for ensuring that the region really does want to secede, and that this opinion is durable (not just due to temporary sentiment) and really is widespread, not merely 50.1% of the population or gotten in a rigged vote.

But if, say, 70% of Catalonia wanted to secede, and this situation continued for years, I would say they have the right to secede without Spanish agreement— despite the fact that Spain is not ethnically cleansing Barcelona.

In the Crimean peninsula's case, my guess is most people really don't want to be part of Ukraine, although now is not a great time to accurately gauge that sentiment, so I wouldn't put a ton of stock in the current votes. Partly that's because it hasn't really historically been part of Ukraine; it's joined to the country due to the whims of a 1950s Soviet leader who gave it as a ""gift"" to the Ukrainian SSR, which is a fairly capricious way of deciding which country a group of people should be part of.",0,1394553131,null,0,1394553347,0,cfzvs6i,t3_204ozh,t1_cfzvs6i,t1_cfzrw1j,null,1432753196,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Abbastanza spesso, dipende dal livello di depressione.

&gt; In quali momenti?

Prima di dormire, da solo nel mio letto e al buio. Il momento più terrificante della giornata.

&gt; Vi spaventa l'idea? Cosa vi spaventa in particolare?

La morte in sé non mi spaventa particolarmente. Quello che mi spaventa è quello che si lascia in chi rimane: so che se venissi a mancare, la mia famiglia ne soffrirebbe troppo. Non è un dispiacere che voglio dare ai miei. E poi mi spaventa il dolore fisico: se deve succedere, spero succeda nella maniera più indolore possibile.

Mi piace credere alla teoria di uno scrittore, Terry Pratchett: ognuno dopo la morte troverà esattamente quello che si aspetta. Se tu credi nell'aldilà, andrai nell'aldilà. Personalmente, credo che finirò a concimare un pezzetto di terreno.

Greece is a special case, but defense spending being the first cut in every year's budget can be dangerous as well. Greece has been one of the very small handful of countries meeting NATO targets, many for well over a decade, sometimes two. 

The US would like to move much of its military resources out of Europe. It has gotten so bad the US threatened to leave NATO since virtually all members are not even making an effort to meet their targets. In a speech in Brussels the US Secretary of Defense said he realizes meeting the targets would be impossible for many NATO members any time soon, but if they consolidated forces to avoid redundancy that would be acceptable too. 

Since his speech there have only been more cuts, and no real efforts to integrate or consolidate. Granted Greece will probably not be the deciding factor, but given one less NATO member will now not be meeting its targets, the US could say ""its been 20 years since most members met their obligations, we no longer have any contractual obligations to NATO"" and call it quits.

He fled the capital that was at that time embroiled in some serious fighting between rioters and police. He was in Kharkiv, where no riots occurred and he has plenty of supporters, until his impeachment. Every single piece of Western media confirms this.

&gt; I never claimed he'd left Ukraine by that time. His physical location is unimportant, his apparent unwillingness to fulfil his presidential duties is what matters.

What you call unwillingness I call incapability. It's kind of hard to do your duties when outside your window a violent mob is calling for your blood. As long as he was in the country, he was fulfilling his duties.

Again, violently running a guy out of town and then claiming he isn't doing his job because he isn't around is not democracy. That's mob rule.

I think it's clear that the consequences of a catastrophic event involving highly radioactive materials can easily dwarf the consequences of even the most dirty and hazardous means of non-nuclear energy production. The only reason why nuclear energy is considered feasible is because we're heavily pushing down on the probability of any mishaps.

Still, while the Fukushima incident was a combination of many rare unfortunate events there also was an amount of luck involved. The molten core could have turned the place into a geyser and the wind could have transported the material towards Tokyo (population 36 million, impossible to evacuate).

I'm not a nuclear engineer. But every time I encountered one on reddit during the beginning of the Fukushima incident they were using their educational advantage for nothing but to mislead and downplay the situation, just as it unfolded. For instance the blog of the MIT's nuclear science department titled ""Fukushima Nuclear Accident – A simple and accurate explanation"" which said ""There was and will \*not\* be any significant release of radioactivity."" All to the great applause of the reddit hivemind and a lot of ridicule for the concerns (most of which were strawman exagerations which they put up themselves), just as the roofs exploded in Fukushima.

As for the kerngedanken blog post (the author of which works for a nuclear waste treatment firm), the fact that the barrel dump was allegedly planned that way makes it more bothersome, not less.

How about some background info.

During SFRY (and FRY later on), every republic and socialist autonomous provinces (Kosovo and Vojvodina) could make their own decisions, EXCEPT for Serbia. If Serbia wanted to make a decision for itself, it had to have a consent of Kosovo and Vojvodina. This follows the 1974 Constitutional changes. Serbia was the only republic with this ""problem"". At the same time, Kosovo could make its own laws without Serbia's consent.

What Serbia tried to do was NOT remove Kosovo's autonomy, but change Serbia's constitution so that Kosovo (or Vojvodina) don't have to agree with every law Serbia passes for itself. Since Kosovo didn't like this, they thought of it as a threat to their autonomy, even though in this case if Serbia passed a law, Kosovo could override it (though it would apply elsewhere in Serbia). 

This is all that was supposed to happen. Not ""remove kosovo's autonomy"".

For instance for the 100 meters dash, if you assume each participating country can send up to 3 athletes (provided they pass the minimas). Then the 3 best of any EU countries would be in the EU team.

[Basically Ukraine gets cheap gas from Russia, which it then sells at a profit to the EU.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ukraine#Fuel_and_energy_complex) Amongst other trade advantages. The closer Ukraine goes to the EU, and consequently to NATO, the less Russia is inclined to give Ukraine good trade deals and cheap gas. 

The Ukrainian economy is in very bad shape. [Ukraine asked the EU for $20 billion in loans and aid back in 2012.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan#Initial_causes) The EU was willing to offer $830 million, on the condition of large-scale legal reforms. Yanukovych tried to push these reforms through parliament so the deal could be accepted. [This association deal would tie the Ukrainian economy closer to the EU and would be one step towards EU membership.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Association_Agreement)

Russia however applied economic pressure not to accept the deal, including tougher customs regulations. Ukraine also has about $2 billion gas debts with Russia, and Russia threatened (as they are doing now) to cut the flow until debts were settled.

Yanukovych thus went back to the EU, and asked for a better deal to compensate for the economic losses from pissing off Russia. The EU refused. Yanukovych then asked to negotiate a new deal, including Russia. The EU once again refused. 

There is no proof whether or not Russia would actually agree to a joint trade deal or whether it was merely a stalling tactic. However, Ukraine is already split between EU and Russia. A joint trade deal would keep the status-quo, with Russia maintaining partial influence. And thus Ukraine would remain a buffer for Russia.

You see back in the day and in less progressive countries women didn't have anything to do. They got married and all they had to do is have children. Nobody asks for their voices, nothing. Just breeding/sex/cooking machines. In modern European society women are equal to men. They educate themselves, go to universities and all. In the end there's no time for a kid-always trying to climb up the corporate ladder. When being an established person they are like 30 or so and it's too late to have more than one kid, sometimes two. Same goes for men. When they are ready for a family they are in their thirties.

Raising your kids. You see for a family on the third world the kid doesn't  carry the same value as in Europe. It's a wealth thing. If you're wealthy you want to give your child the best possible with resources. For an African family 7 kids without education and sometimes food means nothing because they live in the same conditions. The European, having taste for what's good in life-education, a full stomach, a car, clothes etc. wants his children to have all these luxuries as well. So the middle class can usually not afford more than one or two children.

No need for a work force and low infant deaths. A third world family brings kids to the world because they need their help. They'll need those kids to help with all the work on the field, in the house and marry them to someone wealthier by which increasing the household's prestige and wealth. So third world people have kids to be served by those kids because it's the only way to survive. Europeans have kids to serve the kids and make them nice human beings, which means giving them attention and in your 30's you only have attention for a one or two kids.

No wonder my grandpa had 4 brothers and sister, 2 children and 3 grandchildren. You see how it's going downhill with introducing more equality and wealth to the average European family?

You want Europeans to have more kids? There two ways: one is very complicated reforms that will lead to more fertility the other is-take away gender equality, take away wealth and watch Europe explode with kids.

This is not a culture or a race thing. It's all about how life is.

And he considered the ""rumour"" to be credible enough to mention to Catherine Ashton. I assume such phonecalls typically do not occur just to gossip around.

&gt; In a peaceful society, yes. In a society in which a tyrannical regime is ruling, you cannot claim tyranny when that regime is deposed.

And yet this ""tyrannical regime"" has a legitimate and democratically elected parliament ready and waiting to take over, with an established procedure for such events. What a strange tyranny that must be.

&gt; A coup is undemocratic by nature, but as you can see it is supported by the majority of the people, which gives the preceding interim government democratic legitimacy.

Nope, that is not democracy nor legitimacy. That is merely the right of the strongest. A significant portion of the country does not support this coup, and right now they have little to no representation in the new government. Hence the current Crimean crisis and the risk of it expanding in the rest of Eastern Ukraine.

The spirit of the law is likely to make sure the impeachment only occurs when there is sufficient support in the entire country, not merely in the pro-EU half that happens to be violently rioting in the streets of the capital.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Sure. But the CAP scandal is largely bullshit. France still gives more to the EU than it gets back. It still gives more to the EU than Britain does. It still feeds its neighbors with its vast agricultural sector in an open border economy. Without the EU, France would give that lost money to its farmers. That's why French farmers are largely anti-EU, because they don't see the CAP as better than if all that money stayed in France.

It sounds like we have a deal and are agreed that agricultural spending should be a national competence rather than an EU competence and that agricultural spending should not be part of the EU budget at all. It is interesting that in France the French public would want to continue to subsidise farmers to the same extent without the EU. In the UK I expect we would want to subsidise our farmers by much less than they currently get (and put that money elsewhere).",0,1394559441,null,0,false,0,cfzynei,t3_204xhd,t1_cfzynei,t1_cfzxdx5,null,1432754552,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Oh, and who confirmed that wild rumour? Russia? Ofcourse they'd *never* lie. 

Now, I wonder where Ukrainians would get Russian BDUs, Russian vehicles, Russian IFVs, and the latest Russian rifles many of which show the insignia of Russian Federation guard infantry units. Surely they're not part of the Russian military, oh no.

&gt;The spirit of the law is likely to make sure the impeachment only occurs when there is sufficient support in the entire country, not merely in the pro-EU half that happens to be violently rioting in the streets of the capital. So I somewhat have my doubts the spirit of the law was treated any better than the letter.

Pretty sure the spirit of the law would dictate that when the guys with all the guns wearing government uniforms are shooting all the unarmed(OK, *some* were armed) guys with civilian clothes, it's time for things to change.

&gt;Nope, that is not democracy nor legitimacy. That is merely the right of the strongest. A significant portion of the country does not support this coup, and right now they have little to no representation in the new government. Hence the current Crimean crisis and the risk of it expanding in the rest of Eastern Ukraine.

They have plenty of representation in the new government. Because it's a national unity government. Meaning it comprises of parties from across the spectrum. That's generally what interim governments do.

It's the right of the most numerous. And guess who gets into government in a democratic election? The party with the most popular support.

&gt;And yet this ""tyrannical regime"" has a legitimate and democratically elected parliament ready and waiting to take over, with an established procedure for such events. What a strange tyranny that must be.

&gt;Anyone calling Ukraine under Yanukovych a tyranny really needs to get a reality check.

The Yanukovych was so peaceful and democratic that it's responsible for over 100 dead civilians by gunshot and sniper fire. Got it.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"I'm sorry, but I disagree. The CAP needs to be at an EU level with the single market. First, under the agreement on agriculture of the WTO, the level of which agricultural subsidies must be dropped was lowered for the EU as a whole, and not for each member state. To scrap the CAP (what a slogan!) would lead to chaos with respect to how the agricultural levels would be set per country. Furthermore, rules regulating subsidization for manufacturing are very solidly built already under WTO architecture, however the rules for agriculture are much more up in the air (and with the failure to address agriculture in the latest Doha agreement, it's only going to be more murky in the future). This means that whilst there can be no subsidization escalations with manufacturing within the EU, with agriculture there is no such guarantee.

Regardless, the rules governing the single market mean that many protectionist policies that could be put in place under a unified regime are simply and absolutely ineffective on a national level, when a supranational single market is thrown into the mix. If WTO laws regarding agriculture were as stringent as they were for manufacturing, there'd certainly be some scope for compromise. But they're not, and so any devolution of the CAP to the national level would attack the heart of the single market as many countries are unwilling to trade away food security, the idea of multifunctionality in agriculture, or maintaining the rural character for... what? A hard neoliberal wet-dream that ignores many political, social, economic, and security realities? This is simply politically unfeasible, and even from a cost-benefit standpoint undesirable. 

So in summary, I can't help but feel that you're woefully misinformed on the matter and are speaking more out of populist sympathy (after all, it's one of the most common complaints of the EU - albeit by people that have no understanding of the policy), or out of misguided libertarian free-market ideology.",0,1394560715,null,0,false,0,cfzz94o,t3_204xhd,t1_cfzz94o,t1_cfzynei,null,1432754832,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It's needed to protect from imports. Let's say France is trying to subsidize their wheat production, but Germany brings in a lot of cheap wheat from outside the EU, so much that they need to offload some of it. France can't impose quotas or duties on non-EU agriculture because that's an EU competency, and since Germany wanted to abandon food security it needs to be able to import as much foreign food as it needs. But the goods that are in Germany can now be shipped around the EU to countries that are trying to protect their agricultural industry, and undercut the prices. Grain doesn't have a serial (ha) number to identify it's place of origin. So to counteract that, with your proposal of EU set maximum subsidization, there's also need to be a common policy on tariffs and quotas. And once we're at that point, it's simply easier, cheaper, and more responsive to crises to have a CAP.

I would personally do this: when a woman is pregnant I'd give her, by law, 2 years of leave. Her salary before leaving will be cut 50%, but she will still have 50% of the money and her job will be there when she's done. Meanwhile this same job is take by someone young and inexperienced who just graduated and is ready to face life. Doing that job he will get the other 50% of the salary and gain experience. That way we solve the problem with females who don't wanna lose their job due to pregnancy and give an easy start in life for someone, thus reducing youth unemployment. Of course salaries need to be increased dramatically so one salary can provide a middle class life for two people.

What is more I would like to cut on the social welfare that people fit for work receive. And cut deep. The money we save will be given to some kind of privilege for families with kids. And parasites who are able to work but unwilling to will stop leeching on the back of hard working people.

What is more-create more kinder gardens, more schools where the children will be taken care of the entire work they until they hit high school-that way the family can keep working and the children should have a nice, stable place to grow in.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; It's needed to protect from imports. Let's say France is trying to subsidize their wheat production, but Germany brings in a lot of cheap wheat from outside the EU, so much that they need to offload some of it. France can't impose quotas or duties on non-EU agriculture because that's an EU competency, and since Germany wanted to abandon food security it needs to be able to import as much foreign food as it needs. But the goods that are in Germany can now be shipped around the EU to countries that are trying to protect their agricultural industry, and undercut the prices. Grain doesn't have a serial (ha) number to identify it's place of origin. So to counteract that, with your proposal of EU set maximum subsidization, there's also need to be a common policy on tariffs and quotas. And once we're at that point, it's simply easier, cheaper, and more responsive to crises to have a CAP.

If wheat can be purchased more cheaply from outside the EU than in the EU, then obviously I would much prefer to purchase it from outside the EU. I see this as in my interests as a consumer of wheat.

If there is a choice then between having a free market in wheat within the EU together with equalised but high subsidies or having no free marker of wheat within the EU, but some countries free to have no subsidies but import from outside the EU as well, then my strong preference is for the latter option.",0,1394563223,null,0,false,0,cg00g0o,t3_204xhd,t1_cg00g0o,t1_cg000ya,null,1432755397,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Wenn es nichts verwerfliches in den Berichten gäbe, bräuchte man sie nicht verstecken, also ist doch ganz klar, dass es dort brisante Informationen zu verteidigen gibt, vor allem wenn sich alle Fraktionen so schnell einig sind über einen Gesetzesbeschluss.

Meine Hypothese ist, dass es eine Entkopplung gegeben hat zwischen Wählern und Politikern.  Da erstere mit den Details des Politikbetriebes überfordert sind und diesen lange schon nicht mehr verstehen, sind letztere gezwungen, unter sehr schwierigen Bedingungen zu operieren.  Einerseits müssen sie die Kunst des Möglichen betreiben, damit der Laden nicht vollkommen auseinander fliegt, andererseits die Ressentiments und Befindlichkeiten des Volkes bedienen, um wiedergewählt zu werden.  Allzu große Transparenz ist bei diesem Spagat hinderlich, weil  sonst allzu leicht auffällt, wie *fake* die Veranstaltung Politik heute ist, und das wissen sie in allen Parteien.  Deswegen die Einhelligkeit.  Es sollte uns dies Anlass zur Besorgnis sein, weil es ein Symptom eines erkrankten Parlamentarismus ist.

Dass das übrigens nicht nur in Deutschland so ist, hat man sehen können, als ein heimlich gefilmter Mitschnitt von einer Rede Mitt Romney auf einem Wahlkampfdinner die Runde machte.  Er redete dort Klartext, weil er wusste, dass sein Publikum sehr genau versteht, unter welchen Bedingungen er zu operieren gezwungen ist.  In der Öffentlichkeit hätte er *niemals* so geredet, weil es das Ende seiner Karriere bedeutet hätte, und solange das der Fall ist, braucht sich niemand darüber zu wundern, dass Politiker doppelzüngig erscheinen: Sie sind doppelzüngig, weil sie doppelzüngig sein müssen.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"I can't help but think that this is just a point of fundamental disagreement we're going to have, but here's my reasoning for why I think food security in Europe is important. 

In 2008, staple crops (grain, rice, wheat, maize, etc) rose drastically in price, some even going as high as 118% increase. This caused a number of countries to institute export bans to keep the price down in their own countries. In quite a few other countries, there was rioting, looting and demonstrations as a response to those high prices. You think Bangladesh will export their crops to Europe when their people are clamouring for affordable food at home? Think again. Not to mention that the Amazon and old-growth forest in Indonesia is being deforested to make way for more agricultural land, and Europe is already being blamed for that.

Regardless, in western countries, around 10% of oil and gas consumed goes directly into the food process (growing, transporting, packaging, etc). Whilst we're finding a number of unconventional sources for those resources, the price is still rising and as a finite resource will continue to rise. Other associated resources, such as potash, are also beginning to run dry. This is going to increase the price of food globally.

Now, I know you're a reluctant UKIPer, and so I'm hoping you're not one of those climate sceptic loons, but global climate change is making food production increasingly less predictable and unlreliable, not to mention destroying arable land. Sea rises from melting ice caps will flood a good portion of arable land across the globe over the coming decades (remember a good portion of arable land is close to rivers and river deltas). Not only that, but the changing weather patterns also means river floods are more likely to occur damaging production, excessive rains or dry spells ruining production, and so forth.

But as I said, we probably have strong ideological differences here. I think that food, much as water, is a resource that needs to be carefully managed.",0,1394565039,null,0,false,0,cg01aw4,t3_204xhd,t1_cg01aw4,t1_cg00g0o,null,1432755865,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Everyone uses economic leverage to get what they want, disguised as both gifts and punishment. In this case Russia merely brought the best leverage.

&gt; I don't think it was so much the idea of good guy Yanukivich trying to keep everyone happy but more so him trying to give the impression of proper negotiations with the decision already made.

It's more Yanukovych trying to get the most of the deals for his country. Ukraine needs the money, and much more than the EU was willing to give. Using Russia as a leverage of sorts, he was obviously trying to rewrite the EU deal to better favour Ukraine.

&gt; The Maidan protests after all didn't just appear out of absolutely nowhere.

Violent protesting because people are unhappy with the state of affairs in a country are relatively common. They also rarely improve matters, because the things are wrong with most countries are deep-rooted into society, not easily fixable by ousting the scapegoat in charge.

&gt; Remember when the EU talks were halted by ourselves and not Yanukovich and for what reason?

To use Timoshenko as leverage over Yanukovych. We regularly do business with countries with far worse human rights abuses than a show trial for a corrupt politician. And her continued imprisonment was confirmed last november by the very same parliament that is now supposedly championing for freedom and democracy.

&gt; Though I know real life isn't as easy as all armchair rhetoric makes it seem I don't think Ukraine should've let itself get bullied into a choice as the other option is not willing to use that tool.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; In 2008, staple crops (grain, rice, wheat, maize, etc) rose drastically in price, some even going as high as 118% increase.

While there may have been some years in which staple crops have increased in price, the long term trend of costs of food production, particularly with new technologies such as GM foods, particularly with the scope to develop parts of the globe which currently have very inefficient agriculture (and as someone who has spent considerable time in Kenya and Ethiopia, I have seen terribly inefficient agriculture in extremely fertile places with my own eyes), is downwards.

Even noting that the energy costs in food production are variable and even noting that Europe depends partly for energy on Russia etc. Europe can (and should) do a lot more to become energy independent (like USA is fast becoming) by making use of nuclear, shale etc.

I really don't know anything about climate change, but your argument sounds like an argument for food security across the globe, rather than an issue which is specifically European.

A limited war, like one in Ukraine, which would be a conflict neither on NATO or Russian soil, could play out in a conventional manner, with the *threat* of nuclear holocaust keeping it limited and from spreading out of Ukraine/Crimea. Hence making fast-response and well-trained conventional forces capable of actual power projection*(and fielding the logistical/intelligence infrastructure necessary for it)* that much more important** 

That's not accurate, that's not accurate in the slightest. 

Hell, if it was, the Fulda Gap wouldn't of been garrisoned for half-a-century and the Soviet Union wouldn't of been in a conventional arms race with the West all the way up until it's fall. 

Plus, **what if Ukraine goes hot with NATO intervening?** Do you think it would instantly go nuclear? Do you think it would be a *""total war""* scenario?

Perhaps, but I don't think it will. I think it'll be a a *limited conflict*, one where both sides try not to escalate or expand the conflict outside of Ukraine, and one which power projection through conventional militaries will be the deciding factor....which....as far as power projection goes....with the exception of France and the United Kingdom....all of Europe is absolutely fucking useless at without the United States pulling most the weight, specifically in the areas of logistics and intelligence. And even with the United Kingdom and France helping, American support, even if significantly lessened, is still needed, as Mali demonstrated. 

Also, if Russia looses a conventional war in Ukraine, would they go nuclear? Well...fuck they might...I'm not going to deny that Ivan be going buckshit crazy and shit at times....but **would Europe go nuclear over Ukraine if they lost conventionally to Russia there?** Would they mobilize for total war? No, I don't think so, and Russia knows this. 

Worst-case scenario, everybody plays M.A.D., but Ukraine is special because Ukraine isn't in the European Union and it's not in NATO. Honestly, it's not even completely in the European Union's sphere-of-influence, and the chances of it becoming a EU member is still a long, long way off. In Putin's mind, perhaps correctly, all he has to do is a win a limited, fast war, not a long, drawn out one. 

And this is the same reason why China is practicing *""quick, limited""* wars, because them, like Russia, know they have absolutely no fucking chance of winning a extended war against the United States.

Regulierungen sind nur dort zulässig wo ein wirklicher Schaden entsteht und der einzelne Mensch keine Entscheidungsmöglichkeit hat und diesem vollkommen ausgeliefert ist.


&gt; und wenn ja, was hältst du von seinen Aussagen?

Einige Dinge sind interessant und nicht von der Hand zu weisen.

Aber der Grundgedanke dass die Wirtschaft bzw. der ""Kapitalismus"" daran Schuld ist ist in meinen Augen eine Falschannahme.

Die Verantwortung liegt bei jedem Einzelnen. Der Grundton des Artikels ist allerdings ""wir sind alle fehlgeleitete Wesen, dem System vollkommen ausgeliefert"".

Ich für meinen Teil kann sagen das ich glücklich bin, nicht überarbeitet und nicht reich. Ich besitze im übrigen nicht mal einen Fernseher und mein Auto ist ein Passat bj.96. Und den ""McKinsey-Manager"" sehe ich nicht als ""Vorbild"". 

Trotzdem ist der Kapitalismus das einzige System das mir die Freiheit gibt für mich selbst zu entscheiden *wie* ich leben möchte.
Das Leute sich blenden und treiben lassen kann man nicht dem System vorwerfen.

Ein wirkliches Problem sind für Lobbyismus anfällige Politiker und Monopolschaffungen. 

Und noch eine Anmerkung zum in dem Artikel vorkommenden Armutsbegriff.
Die wirkliche Armut in Deutschland (und erst recht weltweit) hat sich massiv verringert. 
Wenn in den Medien und in Parteien von Armut in Deutschland die Rede ist reden wir immer nur von *relativer Armut*. Dieser Fakt wird aber meist außen vor gelassen.

No, but we do have the most professional and well-trained personnel core to expand upon, and as far as the United States is concerned, the most extensive and advanced intelligence/logistical  infrastructure the world has ever seen to facilitate decisive and timely power projection just about anywhere in the world. 

Also, numbers for numbers, the United States *alone* has more men than Russia, and as I said above, a more professional and trained personnel base to expand upon.

2. Even if in some countries child support is impressive... it is apparently not sufficient to stimulate people to have children... the number one complain in this treat is financial constraint

3. There is a **HUGE** misunderstanding about how most pension systems work: one think that your taxes get stashed somewhere, they put in financially profitable assets and then they are distributed back to one, when retirements comes. But I do not think there are ANY country where one pension plan is managed as a totally separate account - rather money are pooled together and then distributed according to promises and needs.

We can talk about details of different pension systems, but I would rather give you one example, why children are essential for one's pension:
Let's say there is a population of 100 people, who are very-child averse, so they gave birth to 10 offsprings all together. And for the sake of argument let's say... there are no immigration (no one wants to live in this country except people born there). These 100 people save 90% of their earnings... so they are filthy rich... at the retirement time. But because there are only 10 people in next generation... so these 10 people will have to service 100 people of older generation... It is not possible (time-wise, following inflation - due to scarcity of labor etc.). So we will witness an abandonment of this first rich generation, and second generation will simply emigrate.

So children are necessary, how to achieve that goal... I do not know, but Sinn's solution is among the least invasive I can think of.

Well, that's at the very least an exaggeration. Mine is working quite fine, and I consider attempts to bottle up and ration an 80-year-old technology which virtually guarantees immunity from attack to be a rather childish exercise doomed to failure long term. Actually, forget long-term, it has failed multiple times since it was introduced. North Korea and Israel have nukes, Iran will definitely have them as well. Is letting Poland get one really so irresponsible?

Nukes aren't banned. Plenty of countries have them, including some that didn't sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Which includes an out clause in case of imminent threat to a signing country's security. You have to give a three-month notice, so that's about it (other than possible reactions by other countries).

&gt;If you think you know the face of nuke war, i suggest you look at the fucking moon or mars. A radioactive cindar blasted by solar wind where not even bacterias would survive. Because that's probably what our planet would be after WWIII.

Yep, I'm sure Arab leaders have thought about this long and hard before deciding to invade Israel again. And then you know what they did? Nothing. Because this vivid mental imagery itself is enough to cool a lot of hot heads.

I don't know what got you so riled up about nuclear war, I guess you missed the part where no one gets nuclear weapons to actually use them. They are a deterrence mechanism, insurance against war.

He needs the oligarchs to run their vast businesses so that millions of Russians can keep working. A lot of Russian towns that industrialised during the Soviet periods are monoindustries. The local economy is based on one big company or factory. Without them the economy would just collapse and the local government wouldn't be getting any taxes. However these factories are outdated and uncompetative. If they were run in a strictly business sense they would be shut down. The oligarchs keep these towns going by using money they earn from more profitable sectors to modernise these places and cover up the losses. 

For example during the global recession the prices of commodities collapsed. A town outside of St Petersburg had it's local economy sink when the Alumina plant that hires the biggest chunk of workers stopped paying wages for three months and shutdown. The locals blocked the Federal Highway and tensions rose. The plant was owned by the billionare Oleg Deripaska who was having problems with debts due to the global recession. Putin came to visit and ordered all of the wages opened and the plants reopened. The wages were paid in full immediately and Deripaska managed to get new loans from Russian Banks to restructure his debts and modernise the plants. Putin came out looking like a hero to the average Russian, Deripaska was saved not only from bankruptcy but also got help to modernise his factories and stay wealthy. If sanctions hit Russia, Deripaska is not going to back away from Putin easily. He needs him.

It's also why I don't think sanctions will be that hard hitting against Russia. They will probably target people in government rather than the Russian economy.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"Was für ne beschränkte Logik. Ich sag dir jetzt mal zwei Sachen, und dann überdenkst du diese Logik mal nochmal bitte.

So eine vor allem eindimensionale Kausalität herzustellen scheitert an der Realität und ist beim Thema Wirtschaft sowas von Stammtisch.

&gt;Da das nicht überall passiert, gehe ich davon aus dass das GPG eben KEIN generelles Problem ist.

Da wir nicht unendlich Frauen und vor allem nicht unendlich Frauen in jeder Branche haben, gehe ich auch nicht davon aus, dass das überall passieren kann.

&gt;Der nächste Punkt: das ist ein Durchschnitt. Wie sieht der Median aus? Wie ist die Verteilung?

Ja du, glaubst du Ich wälze jetzt drei Studien komplett durch um einen derartig detaillierten Überblick zu haben? Das wird dort wohl graphisch sicher zu finden sein, hab aber auch nicht nach diesen Parametern recherchiert.

&gt;Damit würde es sich trotzdem lohnen nur Frauen einzustellen.

Guck mal, was ich kann:

&gt;""Meine Behauptung"": Junge Arbeitskräfte kriegen bei gleicher Qualifikation immer weniger, als bereits ältere Kollegen.

&gt;""Deine Folgerung1"": Damit würde es sich lohnen nur 20-30 jährige einzustellen.

&gt;""Deine Folgerung2"": Da das nicht überall passiert, gehe ich davon aus, dass Neueinsteiger dasselbe Gehalt bekommen, als Alteingesessene.

Äh, siehste wo so ne eindimensionale Logik hinführt? Wie willste mit dieser beschränkten 3-Zeiligen Logik die Empirie mehrerer Studien unterspülen?

1. Deine Logik kann ja schonmal gar nicht auf die Realität zutreffen, weil es nur eine endliche Menge an Frauen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt gibt. (Also mal angenommen, jeder Unternehmer würde profitgeilerweise aus Jux Frauen über den Tisch ziehen-&gt; irgendwann keine Fraueneinstellung zur Profitsetigerung mehr möglich, da kein Nachschub mehr)

2. Der GPG ist flächenübergreifend und durchschnittlich. Es gibt jetzt wirklich tausend Möglichkeiten, für die Situation wenn Frauen durchschnittlich -sagen wir 2%(niedrigst angesetzt)- weniger Lohn bekommen.

Zb könnte ein Personaler den Lohn niedriger ansetzen, weil er die allgemeine /durchschnittliche Mutterschaftsbelastung für den Betrieb (extra?) zu hoch ansetzt.

Wenn der später als Übertreibung vorgerechnete Betrag bei jeder Frau zu durchschnittlich 2% passieren würde, würde das Unternehmen denken, die Frau leiste dasselbe für denselben Preis. Das Unternehmen stellt also Frau und Mann für sie P/L mäßig gleich ein, die Beurteilung der P/L ist aber diskriminierend, da überzogen. In der Studie nach Abzug aller Mutterbedingten Einbußen kommt dann aber raus, dass Männer pro Stunde einfach mehr verdienen für diesselbe Leistung.

Würde interpetiert heißen: die P/L Beurteilung von Unternehmen ist unterm Strich um diese (höchstens, da ja auch andere Effekte mitspielen) 2-4% Frauendiskriminierend.

**Btw**, wegen deiner eindimensionalen Logik: Ich hab schon aus Quellen hier im Sub Erfahrungen mitbekommen, nach denen manche Personaler wohl doch exakt das denken, was du verneinst: Dass Fraueneinstellung lohnend ist. Sie setzen das Gehalt extra tiefer an und drücken es so. (Eine der ""Tausenden"" Möglichkeiten, wie das bereinigte GPG mit zustandekommt.)

Und schon ist deine ""Milchmädchen""-Logik doppelt untergegangen.

Ich versteh sowieso gar nicht wie du mit solchen Aussagen an das Thema ""Wirtschaft"" ranwillst. Mein lieber Mann.

Vor allem sag Ichs mal so: Wir reden von Wirtschaft, auch wenn ein Effekt messbar is, lässt sich jetzt nur schwer durchblicken, wie er zustande kommt.

Beim GPG wurden ja so rangegangen, dass alle externen -sprich *indirekt* diskriminierende- aus den momentanen Gesellschaftsverhältnissen resultierenden bekannten (so wird das auch extra bei wikipedia gesagt) Effekte verrechnet wurden, also können soweit nur noch direkt diskriminierende (bekannte) Effekte übrig geblieben sein.

Da alle Studien auf eine unterschiedlich kleine Zahl von 2-4% kommen, kann also schlecht ein Rechenfehler vorliegen.

Deshalb ist Fakt, dass dieser Effekt vorhanden ist, und eine Erklärung tut somit Not.

Ich nannte jetzt als mögliche Gründe Profitgier (die wiederrum durch zB begrenzte Menge an Frauen in der Auswirkung begrenzt wird), oder die ungerechtfertigte und stereotype Geringerschätzung der Leistung der Frau wegen Mutterschaft u.a.

Noch ein nennenswerter Aspekt ist die Möglichkeit, dass die 2-4% zumindest teilweise unterbewusst entstehen und gar nicht gewollt sind. Denn wir reden nicht von einem auffallendem Effekt wie

&gt;ein Viertel

wie oben gesagt. Sondern von vllt 2-4% Personalkostenersparnis im Durchschnitt!

Das wären jetzt zB auch einigermaßen plausible Gründe, so versucht man sich also an die Lösung des Problems heranzutasten.

Vielleicht merkst du ja daran wie viel Ich hier schreibe, wie umfassend (nicht kompliziert) diese Thematik ist und wie wichtig mir auch umfassende Verständnis ist. Ich kann es auch verstehen, wie man da leicht fehlinterpretieren usw kann, aber wenn du mit soner Logik rangehst wird das ja gar nichts.

Some perspective here from [2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami)

&gt;On 10 February 2014, a Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,884 deaths,[23] 6,148 injured,[24] and 2,633 people missing[25] across twenty prefectures, as well as 127,290 buildings totally collapsed, with a further 272,788 buildings 'half collapsed', and another 747,989 buildings partially damaged.[26] The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse.[18][27] Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, ""In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan.""[28] Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water.[29]

Pensiamo ad esempio ad una donna il cui aspetto fisico è l'unica fonte di guadagno, e che non può quindi permettersi una gravidanza dal punto di vista meramente economico.

Ma so che nel tuo esempio estremo intendevi fare riferimento a motivi puramente estetici. Il principio prevede che si debba valutare caso per caso. Personalmente non avrei un pregiudizio aprioristicamente negativo, seppur possa convenire con te che si tratti di un motivo piuttosto futile. Ma starei applicando la mia morale su un altro individuo, cosa sbagliata sempre, figuriamoci in un rapporto medico-paziente. 

In casi del genere però (ripeto, estremi), raramente la gravidanza è il problema principale. Si tratta nella maggior parte dei casi di donne con un rapporto disfunzionale col proprio corpo, la propria sessualità, e i metodi di contraccezione.

Die einzige Gefahr die in solch einer Situation bestünde wäre eben das Wahlrecht. Natürlich wäre an der Stelle auch klar welche Gesellschaftsschichten dieses System gefährden würden.

Das ist der Ton in dem das Diskutiert wird. Natürlich ist dieser ""Endzustand"" utopisch weit entfernt. Deswegen muss man auch nicht darüber sprechen. Jetzt. Es ist aber eben eine dieser neoliberalen Utopien. Diese Idee ist auch nicht neu.

&gt; * Wir fordern die Wiedereinführung nationaler Währungen oder die Schaffung kleinerer und stabilerer Währungsverbünde. Die Wiedereinführung der DM darf kein Tabu sein.

Hell, the logistical capability of European countries is so bad they were reduced to dropping cement training bombs on Libyan targets instead of actual bombs. 

The same goes for intelligence gathering capabilities and first-strike capabilities. The United States wanted to *""lead from behind""*, but despite that, was forced to be the tip-of-the-spear in taking out AA positions *(mainly with Tomahawks and stealth fighters)* before the other European militaries could begin their bombing runs.

And even Mali, with France's military funding and military preparedness, still required US military support. *MUCH, MUCH LESS*; but still necessary overall.

And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations.

Any attack from Russia would be swift and decisivie.

The best case hope for an invasion from Russia would be a drawn out battle for Tallinn that galvanizes international support for a counterattack.

The problem for NATO is that by the time they could muster a credible defense of Estonia, the country will likely have already fallen. Additionally, the most credible force to relieve a beseiged Tallinn is the American forces stationed in Germany. This is important because any attack on Estonia would have to be treated as a precursor raid on Poland, and allowing a Russian attack to draw those German-deployed forces would be the height of stupidity.

Most likely the best course of action would be sail an American carrier group into the Baltic and begin raiding Russian forces and shipping wherever they could be found. Likewise Russian shipping could be harrased in the Pacific. It's impossible to guage where the battles would go from there. The idea of American marines staging an amphibious assault on Tallinn is an idea out of a Clancy novel, but such seem to be the times we live in.

Das ist kein Argument. 

Versetze dich in die Situation einer angeregten politische Debatte über ein zukunftsweisendes Thema. Möchtest du ernsthaft behaupten dies wäre mit Übersetzern und/oder Fremdsprachen zufriedenstellend möglich?

Eine demokratische, parlamentarische Kultur kann überhaupt nicht entstehen.


&gt; Aber ich würde das wesentliche Problem einer europaweiten Volksvertretung nicht unbedingt an der Sprachenvielfalt festmachen

Nicht ausschließlich, nein. Aber dies zeigt von vornherein das es nicht funktionieren kann.
Zumindest nicht unter den demokratischen und freiheitlichen Umständen die wir aus den Nationalstaaten der letzten Jahrzente gewöhnt sind.



Deine restlichen Ausführungen finde ich sehr interessant, damit habe ich mich noch garnicht genau beschäftigt.

Die Sitzaufteilung auf die verschiedenen Staaten ist auch ein wichtiger Punkt.

Derzeit ist Deutschland, gemessen an der Einwohnerzahl, unterrepräsentiert.
Das demokratische Grundprinzip ""one man, one vote"" hat bei der Wahl zum Europaparlament keine Gültigkeit. Die Stimme eines Maltesers gilt 10-12x mehr als die eines Deutschen.

Man muss es aber auch aus der Situation der kleineren Nationen betrachten, es werden Gesetze und Regulierungen beschlossen die sie zu befolgen haben. Ein Mitspracherecht darüber haben sie aber kaum. Darüber hatte ich vor einigen Wochen erst eine Diskussion mit einem Finnen.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; ""Europe not handling its own defence"" problem won't solve itself anytime soon, as that would require a level of consensus that the EU is incapable of atm.

That I would agree with 100% the Defense Secretary said (when he said the US could leave NATO) that he understands meeting the minimums is impossible for most NATO members to meet their financial objectives any time soon. But stressed that integration and consolidation could take their place. The only real efforts towards this seem to be between the UK and France, who are already the most capable militaries in Europe by far. 

&gt;Also I would argue that war-making enjoys great economies of scale. It would cost less over all for a US-centric solution than for a seperate EU one.

Again I cant disagree. But for whom does it cost less? It certainly costs more for the US, and taxpayers, the DoD, and politicians are getting sick of if. It is not as if NATO members are financially contributing to the US defense budget, or those of the UK and France. If that was the case, I am sure you would hear much less complaining from the US. As of 2011 (according to the US Defense Secretary) the US provides 75% of NATO's funding, I am sure France and the UK make up a sizable portion of the rest. That is more than even during the cold war. 

So yes, it costs less overall, but for European NATO members its much more remedial. They are thinking of it in terms of what costs less for *them*, not what costs less for everyone (or they would be contributing to the budgets of the US, France, and the UK). 

I used this example in the past. It would be akin to signing an insurance agreement that costs $20 per year. The first year you pay $15. You get a letter saying if you dont pay the premium your policy will be cancelled. The second year you pay $10, same warning. The third, $8, same warning. The forth, $6, again, the same warning. If the policy ever was cancelled the policy holder would be the first to cry foul even though he was blatantly not holding up his end of the bargain.

&gt;Also, I know the US often says stuff like ""screw you guys, we're going home! (maybe)"" a lot, but that's more of a bargaining tactic than a real threat.

How is it a bargaining tactic? European nations know the US would prefer a stable Europe, so they keep cutting their budgets banking on the fact the US will keep picking up the slack. The US seems to lose out on every one of these bargains. If it was a bargain the US would get something in return. 

Many Europeans want the US out, and so do many Americans. All it takes is a presidential candidate running on the partial platform of withdrawing resources out of non-conflict areas, namely Europe, and the free ride might be over. Then European governments would have to decide whether to assume the UK and France would fill the same role, or if they could. Whether to remain unprotected, or to increase their spending, which could be very difficult during a recession and at a time when many European nations have high borrowing costs. 

It is not a bargaining tactic, its more of a warning. One that most European nations have brushed off  for decades. Even things that would not cost them a penny like consolidating forces to avoid redundancy (might even save some money). Given all of the warnings, I would hope European nations would not cry foul if the US ever did leave NATO or pull resources out of Europe (which it has been slowly doing over the past few years).

It's the easiest and cheapest way to get a new phone line. 

There is 2 different offers:
For 2e/month you get free sms/mms in France, 2 hours (France and 100 other countries - landline only) and 50mo of data.

For 20e/month you get unlimited calls/sms/mms in France and 100 countries (landline phone only). You get 3Go of data / 20Go if your phone supports 4G (I think it'll be 3Go for you).

You have 10e setup fee (to ship the sim card).

If you are already a client of Free (the internet service), the prices drop to 0e/month and 16e/month. 

All you need is a RIB (you can get that if you have a french bank account) and an address (in order to ship the sim card). 

There's no fees for unsubscribing and you can do it anytime you want (no yearly subscription).


Other mobile services like Orange/Sosh, Bouygues and SFR have generally higher prices and it's a pain in the ass cause you have too much different options that can sometime be free or not. The main asset of Free Mobile is that it's simple and it works.

&gt;__Kildare__ ([Irish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Cill Dara*, meaning ""church of the oak"") is a town in [County Kildare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare), Ireland. Its population of 8,412 (2011 Census ) makes it the eighth largest town in County Kildare and the [55th largest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland_by_population) in the state, with a growth rate of 8.0pc since the 2006 census. Although Kildare gives its name to the county, [Naas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naas) is the [county town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_town). The town lies on the [R445](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R445_road), some 50 km west of [Dublin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin) – near enough for it to have become, despite being a regional centre in its own right, a [commuter town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuter_town) for the capital.

Therefore normal people have to trust the experts.  The experts have failed time and time again at giving dependable judgment, positively proven by a long line of nuclear accidents.  Why should anyone continue to trust them?  When the nuclear reactors of the first and second generation were to be constructed, they, too, were advertised as failure-proof, rock-solid technology that is so reliable that even my comatose granny can operate it, but when the rubber hit the road, catastrophic accidents occurred.  Now the engineers want a ~~third~~ fourth chance.  On what grounds should they be trusted if the nuclear engineers along with the politicians and the executives have a record of betraying the trust put into them?  The nuclear-industrial complex has proven time and time again that it cannot be trusted to deliver and operate nuclear energy technology with an acceptable amount of risk, and it was usually the public that had to foot the bill for repairing any damage produced during catastrophes (I won't even begin to speak of who will have to pay for the cost of nuclear waste disposal).

true,Nemo84,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; Funny, you were claiming the government was illegitimate without giving any sources,

Which is a widely known fact. [If it can be found by 2 seconds of google](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/opposition-looks-to-start-impeachment-proceedings--7602.html), I hardly feel the need to link sources that will inevitably get dismissed out of hand because it doesn't fit some people's biased worldview.

&gt;  Do you need to reread rediquette?

Which, as everyone on this site knows, is worthless and never followed. Besides, I'm pretty sure the reddiquette allows downvoting for posts depicting lies as fact.

Here are the ""don't"" for voting, from the reddiquette:

- Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

- Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

- Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source. Quality of content is more important than who created it.

- Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

- Report posts just because you do not like them. You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules.

Note how it doesn't say: ""please don't downvote the guy spreading lies and propaganda""?

Well if that's the worst that can happen then that's not too bad.

&gt;people from small countries get way too overrepresented for me to consider this democratic.

This is to make sure that small countries aren't simply disregarded by the larger ones, in a tyranny of the majority/largest countries. Otherwise, no small countries would ever join the union. Look at the US electoral college or the apportionment of any federal state, and you'll find they follow the same logic.

&gt;distribution of seats should be ""degressively proportional"" to the population of the member states [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament)

Even in the case of the German Bundestag (which I pick as an example of a federal system that tries to force constant population/seat ratio), the only way to make it so that the seats are proportional to the population is by changing the size of the constituencies, redrawing their borders, if their population ever diverges too much from the average. Were you planning to redraw the European borders? I wouldn't be in complete disagreement for such a thing under a full-blown European Federation, actually, but that's still a long way off.

&gt;On average, each constituency has 222,000 German residents. The Federal Electoral Law prescribes that an average population in a constituency may not be more than 33 1/3 per cent more or less than this average figure. This is the absolute limit for population discrepancies. If the divergence is greater, the constituency boundaries have to be altered. This has often been the case. [(Source)](http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/literature/introbwg.htm)

Larger countries already have a huge weight due to their economic power, so much so that they *in effect* rule the Commission and the Council and as such control legislative initiative in the EU.

Nobody is arguing that Yanukovych should remain president until the next election. The point is merely that at this point, legally speaking, he still appears to be the president.

USA in the last 10 years has had one, a uranium miner died when a support beam collapsed. Japan has had 7 from legitimate accidents. This should tell you something about the nuclear industry in Japan, not about all kinds of nuclear reactors forever. 

You're also ignoring the data from all the nuclear reactors who do run well, and all the other types of power generation which are prone to accidents. It's actually similar to airlines and cars. Just because airline crashes make the news more than car crashes doesn't mean cars are safer than airlines. If you do the math, you'll find out it's the opposite. I find normal people are quite capable of doing this, so long as they are given the time to think.

Compare nuclear for example to wind. Wind turbines kill 14 people per year in England, mostly maintenance accidents. Why aren't you banging on the doors of the wind-industrial complex? ""Oh, that's mostly poor people anyway?""

Or take the coal plants that are now being built to replace nuclear. In the England, coal kills 3000. That's from pollution mostly, which the public foots the bill for via healthcare. That's why coal is so cheap. No matter how much you value a human life at, I'll take the combined cost of all nuclear accidents ever over that.

I was first year at University, I didn't know anyone in the city, I didn't know about the living conditions in the dorms, this one or the other ones, so I applied for this dorm. 

People have to ""bribe"" to get room in the dorms, not actually to give money, but to find friends in the student associations to give you more points.

We were allowed and were expected to ""fix"" things to make the room more livable. Students paint the walls, many bring beds or mattresses...
But I wasn't able to fix things so I quit the dorms as soon as I found private room for the same price plus bills, just without food. 

You are seeing this post and pictures as part of the campaign which have goal to introduce the people in Macedonia with the conditions in the dorms, many people don't even know that it is this bad.

There is no need to try and predict the future (how many kids one will have) and discriminating in taxes is possible and happening. 

Parents get tax breaks and refunds as well as other direct and indirect benefits that draw money from the state budget (paid maternity leave, more holidays, more sick days, prenatal/delivery/post birth healthcare, advantage for buying subsidized housing...). If and when you have a child, your income and partially real estate taxes could be (and are) adjusted. Childrens' products have lower VAT.

Now, should we adjust them in such a way that parents pay more or less? Why more? Because parents and their children require certain public spending that would not be necessary for adults only


2) Neither child support nor any other form of direct public funding for stimulation of procreation can provide sufficient long-term financial stability, not alone. 

Economy as a whole has to be functional and that is what countries and governments have to guarantee in order to stimulate population growth – stimulating and good enough living conditions. Enough jobs, fair payment for that work and good working conditions in general (e.g. 40 hours working weeks instead of 70 for a liveable wage), available healthcare, quality education, affordable housing, healthy environment... 

That is what countries can do and should provide if they want their citizens to have children. Political demography, politics in general, macroeconomics and microeconomics are interdependent and inevitably all the factors affect each other. 


3) I don't agree that there is an issue of misunderstanding. State budget is not that much different than personal budgeting. 

If I earn 10 of something a year for the next 40 years, I will earn 400 alltogether during the 40 years. Does that mean I can spend 400 during those years? 
Well, if I know that I have an obligation to pay 5 a year for the following 20 years when I won't be earning anything, then no, I have to put some of it aside. To be precise, I have to put a 100 aside over 40 years, 2.5 a year, meaning I can spend 7.5 every year that I earn 10. 
Retirement funds usually are separate and they are not and shouldn't be government's spending money.

By the way, since 2001 one of the 2 parts of our pension system does stash the taxes somewhere and puts them in financially profitable funds in order to distribute them back to each person, according to the amount that person invested/contributed to the fund over the years. The other part is the generation solidarity one where money is pooled together and then distributed according to promises and needs.

There's a third part as well, state-subsidized voluntary personal retirement saving.




As for your example, it is not applicable because it is not realistic.
In reality, the 100 people in a country with low fertility rate would have 80-90 kids, not 10. (I live in a country with one of the lowest rates in the world and negative population growth and even here it would be 72-75.) The 100 people would not all be of the exactly same age and would not all retire at the exactly same time. So the process is gradual which makes it easier to handle, to react and adjust. And the fertility rate cannot decline continuously forever.

Also, there *is* migration/immigration. If globalisation works for goods and services, it should also be encouraged and work on other levels and in all parts of the system.

And if your 100 people were filthy rich by the time they retire, they could easily pay for the services that could not be provided by their own next generation. 


You are saying that children are necessary as if we're choosing between high and zero birth rates and as if there is not enough people eligible for work in the world (and even in the countries with negative growth themselves).




Finally, Sinn's solution suggests forcing people to have children for the economic wellbeing of a  country (procreate or the state will punish you). I can hardly imagine a more invasive one. 




Croatia has 1.45 fertility rate. 32,7 is the average age for becoming independent from your parents (as in – moving out and providing for yourself). Negative GDP growth for the past 5 years. Constant (and increasing) massive foreign debt since before we became an independent country. 21,9% unemployment (with a steady rise since 1980s, even 1950s). Low purchasing power. War on our soil 25-20 years ago (complete with infrastructure damage and large refugee and displaced population).  Very difficult political and economic transition including mishandled privatization and unimaginable levels of corruption and bad governing.

Trust me, the concept of being childfree by choice is still science fiction for the vast majority here, it is not the people who don't want to have children that have brought us to the point of 1.23 employed providing for one retired person.



TL; DR Forcing people to procreate and punishing them if they choose not to is not the solution, providing political and economic stability and good governing/budgeting is.

It's quite simply because children are an economic burden and a medium-term sacrifice, and one that you will not usually get any payback from. A child cannot reasonably expect to start becoming cashflow-positive until they are in their early to mid-20s, and even then it's just usually enough to survive on for a while.

And during those entire 20 years, you're sacrificing time, money, and possibly even career advancement to raise them. That last point is especially why Asian countries have such a low rate: Your company will think less of you for taking more leisure time for dating/children, and most don't fight against it. It's quite sad, really: They are working themselves to negative population growth. Negative growth means a larger retirement population with respect to the younger generation, which means they need to work more to pay for everyone, thereby meaning that they will have less time/money for kids, and so the rate goes lower, etc.

A lot of people are just deciding that it isn't worth the hassle if one of them isn't going to become a full-time parent (and very few people want to become one). Others will have one child, remember what was involved and then not want to go through it again.

The only cultures that don't seem to have this problem are cultures that put extreme emphasis on children over things like career or material possessions (which just so happens to be religious most of the time). Non-religious tend to focus on career and standard of living.

The only solution to this problem is to make children less of an economic burden (and I don't mean free daycare or something like that, that only shifts around the costs, it does not get rid of them).

I'm very proud of the United States military and the stability, even if you deny it, it brings to the world.

true,Gypsiesdonthavehoney,DENK,Denmark,"So I'm going to tag along here:

First, the [statistics](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Fertility_statistics). After declining rapidly since the economic boom after WWII, the fertility rates have been rising slowly since their nadir in the early 1990's. The last average for EU27 from 2009 was 1.59.

Then, a couple of reasons.

* **Women in the work force**. As /u/MartelFirst points out, women's work force participation generally drive the birth rate down. However, in countries like Italy and Poland, who have some of the lowest percentage of women working, the fertility rates are still among the lowest in Europe. 
On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries, who have some of the highest percentage of women working (also over 30 hours a week), the fertility rates are much higher.
* **Institutionalised child care and benefits**. Scandinavian countries have universal benefits for children and institutionalised child care is (almost) free and the social norm. This helps alleviate the curb on fertility rates caused by working women and...
* **Education**. More and more people are taking secondary and vocational training. That makes more young people postpone their first child, which has also caused the average [maternal age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age) to rise to almost 30 in many European countries [citation needed]. If you look at socio-economic differences, the wealthiest generally also get less children and they get them later. As Europe still has much less economical disparity than the U.S., this *might* be one of the reasons why the U.S. has a higher fertility rate than Europe [citation needed]
* **The economic crisis** since 2008 has obviously surpressed the desire to have children. There is a correlation between the number of people living with their parents and the fertility rates. When many young people (espcecially in Southern Europe) [can't even afford to move way from their parents](http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-447811-galleryV9-fcmy.jpg), that means that starting a family is not a priority for them.
Though I don't have the numbers, this *might* have caused the fertility rate to drop again since 2009.

true,BoilerButtSlut,UNSA,Amerikai Egyesült Államok,"&gt;But such way of thinking is a never-ending hole, and it is very dark. I am not active in sports, yet the taxes I pay build stadiums and swimming pools... etc

This is why I am generally in favor of taxes that only affect the people who use the services. So a roadway or gasoline tax is great because I can just choose to not have a car and avoid it altogether. The same for stadiums, etc. Everyone getting taxed for services that they don't use creates two problems: 1. Apathy, because very few people are going to bother to look where their money is going or whether it is being spent efficiently because it's hard to determine how much you are actually paying and 2. Corruption, for the same reason above.

&gt; Anyway, the pension system is not based on children having to provide for their parents pensions but on each person providing enough during their working part of life to sustain them when they retire

But the problem is that pensions are not structured this way. They are pay as you go. The current working generation pays for the retired one. I think there are actually very few countries, if any, that have a worker save for their own retirement and not pay for someone else's. This is why basing it on children has some appeal: A worker isn't paying for someone who didn't contribute to the working pool, nor contributed toward the next generation who will pay for their retirement.

I don't think basing it on children is a good idea, partially for the reasons you stated above, but I think making people only responsible for their own retirement would go a long way.",0,1394582772,null,0,false,0,cg09w3x,t3_204i6i,t1_cg09w3x,t1_cfzrq6n,null,1432759978,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I don't think anybody is saying this is a moral thing, though I think morality plays a strong factor, but I agree it's mostly realpolitik. 

That said, compare American realpolitik in Western Europe to Russian realpolitik in Eastern Europe, or Poland/Estonia to Kazakhstan/Belarus. I think it's pretty easy to see which one is more beneficial, and which one, specifically in Europe's case, leads to a more open and democratic society with a more dynamic economy. 

Also, there comes a time when the negatives outweigh the positives. Back during the Cold War, the influence our military protection bought us in the continent was invaluable. But now? *Not so much.* We are moving away from our old Europe-based strategy and *""Pivoting to the Pacific/Asia""*. There's a reason they're calling this the *""Asian Century""*, and America doesn't want to be left behind, especially in a multi-polar world. 

With this in mind, having to carry most of Europe's weight, as evidenced most strongly by Libya *(and The Balkans I guess)*, and to a lesser degree Mali, is taking away from our overall strategy, instead of being the center-piece of it.

And I believe it is important that we all pay taxes even for the services that we personally don't use. Society needs sports and arts and roads etc. and we all benefit from it in some way. We need to provide the whole package to have whole people. 

Top of mind example: if only people interested in arts and culture paid taxes for those purposes, then kids whose parents weren't interested would never have access to any of it. Collective knowledge and access to it is important. 
Or, if one didn't see the benefits of scientific research and declined paying that part of taxes, would he not benefit from the results just the same as everyone else? Same as you benefit from roads and cars by using services that require them and buying goods that were transported on those roads; you benefit from other people's use of those resources.

Also, apathy can and should be solved by politically educating citizens. When that's done, corruption will be much more difficult (for politicians).

If by ""getting the memo"" you're suggesting that we should invest more into military, I would strongly disagree. Influence via militaristic power is more characteristic of imperialistic countries from the past and current federations like Russia and the us and a. Investing more money into something as useless as a military won't do anybody good. 

Unfortunately, since americans/chinese/russians love a dick measuring contest and have to drag the rest of the world with them into this stupid and juvenile game. 


The time of satan-like characters like Kissinger should be coming to an end. 




American influence doesn't come cheap. Your ambassador has the nerve to ""condemn"" a decision that our democratically elected parliament took today. In a backwards country, something like this would be meet with violence repercussions at the american embassy or something like that. But in Romania, those statements make the news across every station, and are regarded as very respectable comments from a respectable source. 


The russians don't do things like that here. And if they did, they wouldn't make the news. 


That's why companies like Exxon and Chevron are being defended by some news agencies for fraking, and Gazprom is instantly discredited using the most vile and outrageous fox-news-like statements. 


We survived the russians and the soviets before there was a nato. Before any organization like that gave a shit, and before the soviets gave a shit about nato. 


What we didn't have back then, and we still don't have now is a good health system, educational system, infrastructure, and a lot more other more important stuff than some contribution to an american organization. Unfortunately, our assholes in the government decided to buy some american jets. 



Every time I see a westerner complaining about ""giving"" money to poor countries, I have ask (most of the times I ask myself) how many of their companies are making money here and how many romanian companies are making money there. Almost always, the western companies, western government(partly/fully state-owned companies) or western businessmen are making more money here than their government is spending here. 



Saying that the help we get is charity is simply ignorant.

I'm not saying we should get out of the nato/eu, and I'm not saying that being apart of bigger world organizations isn't beneficial to Romania, but it's not like you're doing it for free.

Well, my first reaction is to wonder why they didn't save enough (barring some catastrophic inflation or financial collapse) when they had 30-40 years to do so. But to answer your question, you could offer a government ""safe"" plan that people could pay into that puts your money into a government-managed savings plan that you cannot under any circumstances withdraw from until you are retired.

While you might be right about popular sports activities (partially right, IMO), the same could not be said for arts. Quality, inventiveness and popularity don't necessarily coincide in culture (or science, for example), as has been proven through history. And popularity and commercial value should not be our only or even main criteria. 
Art/culture does get a lot of government funding in Europe, too. 

I look at it this way - if you've ever watched a football game, you benefited from something you wouldn't want to pay taxes for. If you ever read a book written by someone who traveled by car or was inspired by some piece of art they saw in a museum - you benefited from the roads and the museum and maybe a public library that writer frequented as a child, if you enjoyed and learned something from a documentary about space, you benefited from science and technology provided by those who paid related taxes...

These shitty ideas work well nowadays, because they are opposed to the inadequacy of our political class.

Berlusconi often flirted with this nostalgia, minimazing the horror of our past. He event brought one of Mussolini's grandsons in our parliament.

Long story short: Mussolini and fascism are much more tolerated than you can expect, and the idea that ""he did nothing wrong"" is surprisingly strong, despite the effort of intellectuals and (some) media.",0,1394588425,null,0,1394588854,0,cg0cc0r,t3_206q7f,t1_cg0cc0r,t3_206q7f,null,1432761262,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

I kind of saw it as directed towards non-Europeans. It seems to advertise the entire continent as a destination. The European Commission promotes [Europe abroad](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/tourism/documents/communications/commission-communication-2010/index_en.htm) as a tourist destination fairly heavily. 

Although it certainly would make Europeans want to travel within Europe as well I would assume. ",0,1394589196,null,0,false,0,cg0coqm,t3_204n4v,t1_cg0coqm,t1_cg01lkf,null,1432761427,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
