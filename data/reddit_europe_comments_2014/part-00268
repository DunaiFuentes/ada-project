Magari sono stato poco chiaro, per ""dibattito sulla liceità della satira"" non intendevo parlare di leggi e ordinanze, ma semplicemente della questione etica che uno si pone prima di fare una battuta scorretta (posso? è giusto? è di cattivo gusto? ferirò qualcuno?). è un richiamo all'autocensura, non alla censura: 
 
A me ad esempio il thread su Spinoza avrebbe fatto sorgere molti interrogativi: posso far ridere con questa notizia? posso utilizzarla come esercizio per affinare la mia abilità di autore satirico? è giusto che la mia battuta derida la vittima e non l'omicida? ha senso utilizzare una tragedia appena avvenuta come appoggio per una battuta molto banale sui napoletani / la politica / la trattativa stato mafia?...e così via. Alle prime due avrei pure risposto di si, poi ponendomene altre probabilmente avrei lasciato perdere. su Spinoza invece mi sembra che valorizzino le battute facili e banali ma politicamente scorrette, che fanno tanto antieroe iconoclasta che scrive commenti sprezzanti fumando gitanes senza filtro, e se ne fotte del parere del lettore (anzi, gode nelle critiche perché lui è anche un provocatore e il lettore è sicuramente un rosicone).

* It includes enough people to guarantee a significant variety among them, enabling a real social debate, and preventing secessions to happen on whims.

* For the same reason, it makes it difficult for ""*two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner*"" kind of situations to arise.

* The number is big enough to prevent secessions motivated by criminal schemes (or similar loopholes). It would also make it more noticeable if a part tried to non-democratically influence the vote's result (for instance, moving other people to the place just to vote).

* We have current examples of city-states that manage just fine.

---

&gt;

&gt;In [Spanish dialectology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dialects_and_varieties), the terms ___distinción___, ___seseo___ and ___ceceo___ are used to describe the opposition between dialects that distinguish the [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) /θ/ and /s/, and those that exhibit [merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_(phonology\)) of the two sounds (*neutralización*) into either /s/ (*seseo*) or [s̄], a sibilant fricative similar to /θ/ (*ceceo*).

&gt;Dialects that distinguish the two sounds, and thus pronounce the words *casa* ""house"" and *caza* ""hunt"" differently, are described as having *distinción*, whereas the dialects that lack this distinction and pronounce the two words as [homophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone) are described as having *seseo* if both words are pronounced with [s] or *ceceo* if both words are pronounced with [s̄].

&gt;*Seseo* is typical of the [Latin American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America) and [Canarian dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canarian_Spanish) and some dialects of central [Andalusia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), whereas *distinción* is typical of most dialects in Spain, except in much of Andalusia and the Canary Islands. *Ceceo* is found in some dialects of Spain, in the southernmost part of Andalusia.

true,Nilbop,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; In a game of civ when you go to war with another country with which you have a trading agreement, you immediately loose the resources you were trading with thus penalty is immediately effective. Sanctions do not operate like that, they have more of a mid and long term effects which would cripple future growth and create a number of problems later down the line. 
&gt; If you were to get on the ""hype train"" of sanctions and fail to recognize when to jump off the loco, you might create a bigger mess than you initially intended to be. Thats all i am saying.

So it's a videogame?

&gt; I agree, we are already on the path of ""who is going to inflict the most amount of damage for the other side"", but the desirable outcome for Europe might slightly deviate from the path that Russia will choose. Basically i think we both might loose more than we initially wanted, with some very ugly developments further down the line. 

I'm still confused; what was the treaty you referred to breaking earlier?

&gt; I see this a bit differently, in my opinion Merkel has caved in into hawks and is on a path of non-stop sanctions every other month,regardless of Ukrainians developments (non-stop pressure until unconditional surrender so to speak). 

That may be your opinion, but the facts are there in the open for anyone to see: for the first few months Russia had to deal with minor sanctions based on the travel abilties of several of it's political elite. Then as it insisted on maintaining it's stance of aggression the sanctions slowly ratcheted up and are only now starting to effect the Russian energy market. There have been highly visible calls from within Germany and in the greater EU to sanction the entirety of the Russian energy market, gas and oil, from the very outset to force a quick resolution of events. Merkel did the most she could for Russia by keeping these sanctions small and relatively painless for as long as she could, a more determined leader would not. Even now, there is talk about the sanctions being lifted next month if Russia can be seen to be facilitating a peaceful resolution to events. Europe has been bending over backwards *not* to hit Russia with hard sanctions.

&gt; It is unlikely that Russia will tolerate such treatment, so ""voice of reason"" would be drown in ""hawkishness"" from both sides -&gt; thus making things even worse. 

Here is the crux of the issue that I took pains to illustrate in my previous post: Russia has no choice *but* to tolerate the sanctions. There is no force it can wield to convince Europe to drop these; it cannot forestall gas shipments to Europe because it's economy is dependant upon that revenue, and it cannot match the EU or NATO in force of arms. It's only recourse is diplomacy, and there has been little sign of reasonable diplomacy from the likes of Sergei Lavrov while Merkel has been extremely accomdating to the point of pissing off her own voter base.

&gt; So, Russia must admit that it basically has lost what it considers as its own backyard or ""sphere of influence"", pay the reparations + quietly roll over and die to its Western Overlords? Are you a big fan of Treaty of Versailles by chance? 

Okay two points:

1. You asked me ""Why is everyone so sure this would end if Russia agreed to demands?"" I told you why; because the EU are setting the sanctions and they have stated repeatedly that they will lift them if Russia accedes.
2. Was that question in bad faith? Because now you are talking about imperialism.

Russia does not have any right to dictate terms to Ukraine. Ukraine is a sovereign European nation bordering the EU and is perfectly within it's rights to seek closer ties with Brussels. There are obvious reasons for why it would do this:

1. The EU's economy is strong and varied and opens up avenues for investment in Ukraine and for Ukrainian businesses to act within the EU free trade zone.
2. The EU has a history on transparency of law and respect for human rights.
3. Russia has shown a willingness to impose it's will on what it views as it's ""backyard"", which it cannot do to members of the EU without reprecussion.

Why would Ukraine not seek to pursue the self-determination and economy-building that the EU allows? Look at the examples of Russia, whose economy is moribund and shored up by the energy market it uses to exert political will (and thus minimize private-sector profits) with a history of corruption and human rights violations, and Poland, whose economy has blossomed in the EU, whose international standing has only grown and has seen it's governmental accountability and justice systems improve? The EU simply offers more freedom and more possibility for growth and getting out of Russia's ""backyard"" as you call it. Why would any nation choose to be under Moscow's hegemony? It doesn't make sense. I'm sure it does for *Moscow*, but Moscow doesn't rule Ukraine, or Poland, or Estonia.

I want to focus on a few things you said that rubbed me the wrong way:

&gt; pay the reparations 

If one country invades another and helps destroy parts of it then they should be expected to pay reparations. It happened in World War 2. It happened to the USA in Iraq and Afghanistan, costing their economy billions and billions of dollars. Why *shouldn't* Russia pay for invading? It makes no sense.

&gt; quietly roll over and die to its Western Overlords

Let me put this in context for you; Russia is being asked to pull it's army out of a peaceful country that it has invaded and stop backing the insurgency that is costing the citizens of that country their lives, and you are telling me this is asking Russia to roll over and die?

The EU is not asking for billions of euros and priceless artifacts it can take back and house in the Louvre and the Royal Gallery; it is asking Russia to be reasonable and to respect the sovereignty of it's neighbour.

&gt; Are you a big fan of Treaty of Versailles by chance

I'm going to give you a chance to explain yourself about this.

&gt; On a side note, how would you describe the role of Turkey in Syrian crisis (and other gulf states)?

I'm not following the Syrian crisis so I don't feel knowledgeable enough to talk about it. You can check my post history if you like, it's simply not something I'm currently interested in.

&gt; but i do wonder why is that European officials has repeatedly traveled to Maidan to participate in protests against elected democratically government and did nothing for Turkish protests?

I'm sorry, what officials are you talking about? I'm not denying they went there, if any did, I just can't think of any off the top of my head. I will say that relations with Turkey have been extremely cool for a long time with several member states strongly opposed to including them in the EU, so I'm not sure why you would expect EU involvement in Turkish protests. The EU is simply not interested in including Turkey on certain levels.

&gt; I am by no means a pro-Russian poster, what i am trying to advocate is a bit of restrain in eagerness to ""punish evil Russia"". Usually, tunnel visioning something is bad and while i do think that Europe will not lift sanctions out of nowhere, until conflict is over, the idea that Russia itself will stop unless it will be grated a somewhat desirable/acceptable outcome is naive. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being pro-Russian; Russian is a wonderful country with an incredible history and a stoic people that have contributed many things to the world that they can be eminently proud of. Furthermore, I have no problem with talking to someone who supports Russia's recent actions in Ukraine as long as they can reasonably defend their opinions. With that in mind:

1.There is no policy of ""punishing evil Russia""; Russia is being sanctioned because it is an aggressor state that has invaded a peaceful neighbour, continues to occupy it, wages a propaganda war against it (and the EU and US at large on this issue) and has backed and continues to back an armed insurgency within the country's borders. There is no attitude of sanctioning Russia just because it is *Russia*, these sanctions are in place because the Putin adminstration broke international law and continues to violate them.
2. As I've said earlier I will repeat now; the EU has been more than accomodating to Russia. The slow-burn attitude towards sanctions has angered many citizens who wish a swift end to the invasion of Ukraine, but several leaders, chiefly Merkel, have been extremely concerned with the effects on Russian trade and impacts on the Russian economy as a whole. To repeat myself: Cameron has come out today and said these sanctions can be lifted within the month if Russia is seen to be accomdating a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian conflict.
3. The idea that Russia be offered a reward in order to convince it to cease it's actions is **absolutely absurd.** Let me put this into perspective: Russia has invaded a peaceful nation, annexed part of it, fomented a rebellion in another and by many reports mounted an armed invasion which it insists to the world does not exist. The sheer **audacity** of saying Russia must be *rewarded* for it's actions before it will stop is *mind-boggling* to me. Russia decided on it's own to invade a country that posed no threat to it or it's holdings. It sought no diplomatic solution. The only outcome that is reasonable to any impartial bystander is the return of Ukraine's sovereign land to it, Russia pulling it's forces out of Ukraine, and ceasing to back the rebellion. **That is not asking a lot from Russia.**

The idea that it would ask the EU to disregard it's own interests in the region and moreso *reward* it for it's actions is so far estranged from reality that I'm shocked you can even ask that of me.

&gt; TL;DR to yours - Ukraine is in Western sphere of influence now, Russia can go fuck itself and cannot protect its national interests/backyard because it is too weak. Gotcha. 

I have been polite to you about this and argued in good faith while backing up reasoning as logically and reasonably as I can while seeking not to offend your sensibilities. If you continue to be snide to me, that won't happen again.

Now, to deal with your final point, as impolitely as you phrased it: there is no reason for Ukraine not to seek closer ties with the EU. There is no reason for the EU to stop Ukraine doing this. Russia openly invaded Ukraine and continues to occupy and attack it. There is *no going back to Russian hegemony for Ukraine.* You cannot expect a nation to agree to be on good terms with you again after you've killed it's people and taken it's land for your own, and I say that as an Irishman who grew up as part of the United Kingdom.

Bukovina and neighboring regions were the nucleus of the Moldavian Principality, with the city of Suceava as its capital from 1388 (after Baia and Siret). The name of Moldavia (Moldova) is derived from a river (Moldova River) flowing in Bukovina.*

While I don't find that objectionable, a lot of people from the Republic of Ireland would. I've not looked in to it enough but I've seen many of them claim that, while yes the term does have origins which date back to ancient Greek times, it fell in to disuse and was only repopularised in the 19th century to try and quell Irish nationalist sentiment and homogenise the two cultures. 

As I've said, I don't know whether that's true but I do know, for Scotland, that the English (by that time British I guess) Government of the day did act similarly towards Scotland and tried to popularise the terms 'North Britain' and 'South Britain' to achieve much the same ends as the Irish claimed the revival of the ""British Isles"" terminology was about. 

I won't make a judgement on the name for the wider archipelago but, since Scotland is predominately located on Great Britain, the demonym 'British' will continue to be applicable indefinitely. The larger, more common, meaning of British, however, is 'a citizen of the UK'. While that could change, Scots will only continue to be British in that sense if they hold dual nationality (which most Scots currently alive would continue to do, as would the next generation be entitled to by virtue of descent). 

TL;DR It's not just a geographic term, there is at least a lot of baggage associated with it. That said, the argument about the archipelago's name is irrelevant to fact that the island Scotland is on is 'Great Britain'. Scots will also continue to have British citizenship so, even without geographic meaning, the applicability of the name would continue on for a length of time anyway.

German took a major hit from the Chernobyl nuclear plume. Asides from some mildly radioactive boars, nothing happened. An accident, in the unlikely case that one should happen, would be hard pressed to be worse than that.

The main damage would be psychological.

The chance and the impact of a waste incident are small. Since radiation is dependent on concentration to do damage, the leaking of waste would actually make it less harmfull.

Besides, we dumped thousands of tonnes of waste (mainly nuclear programs) in the North Sea in earlier times. Most of that is leaking, yet no effects are noted.

&gt;Also nuclear plants are really really expensive, thats why energy companies don't really build them, it takes a long time of them working for them to pay for themselfs...

To be fair, a lot of Swedish people I know complain about people not speaking English when they go abroad too. I get that it looks bad when people from the UK expect other places to speak English but, at least in the service industries near tourists areas, it's not entirely unreasonable or arrogant to expect Europe's lingua franca to be spoken. 

That said, the only time I, personally, have got annoyed with there being no English speakers around was in Galeao International Airport, in Rio. Then again, I'm pretty sure they could speak English better than they pretended and were trying to use a faux language barrier to scam us out of more money for the taxi fare.

You can also believe that the world is 6000 years old if you want too. The consensus of historians is that WW1 was mainly caused due to German foreign policy of the prior decade, which consisted of a swaggering and bullying approach which angered the French-British and Russians so much that three enemies formed an alliance over the German threat. The Moroccan incident, shows exactly how the Germans were conducting themselves on the world stage. Also a great deal of blame goes to Germany because they invaded a neutral country during the war. Which is the height of unlawful conduct and the 'strong will do what they can, weak must suffer what they must' mentality which the German government espoused during those years. There was a significant right wing portion fo France on which a portion of the blame can be put, but the majority rightly falls on the german government.

As for WW2, the treaty of Versailles was no harsher than the treaty which the Prussians forced on the french after the franco-prussian war. Not only were the German treated in the same manner they had treated the French prior, but they, unlike the French, who had conceded defeat and paid of reparations; did everything possible to subvert the treaty of Versailles, often damaging the German economy doing it, just to spite the French.

There is no real controversy here, this is the current consensus of historians. ",0,1410467805,null,0,1410468100,0,ckfnpg1,t3_2g3fe5,t1_ckfnpg1,t1_ckfbpf6,null,1427066144,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

EU could put a stop to it through a unified energy market used to negotiate pricing, but then Germany would likely not get the same lower price so they naturally would be against it.

That cheap price keeps Germany trapped and in Russia's pocket since they have zero need to look at alternatives with cheap Russian fuel and instead take ""morally superior"" stances on alternative fuel types.

I think it's ""io te voglio bene assaje, tutt' quant' l'italian'!"", which means ""I love you so much, love you so much, to all Italians!"".

The key difference is the L before ""italian'"".

**""Tutt quant' italian'""** means **""Everyone is Italian"".**

**""A tutt quant' l'italian'""** means **""To all Italians"".**

""Tutt quant l'italian"" means ""to the whole Italian"" which doesn't make any sense.... Nevertheless, he wouldn't have said ""l'italian'"" if he meant just ""everyone is Italian"", so I'm going to go for ""to all Italians"". So if you're absolutely sure that he said ""L'Italian"" instead of ""Italian"", it means ""i love you, I love all Italians"". If he didn't say that L, it means ""I love you, you're all Italians"".

true,Aerrae,FINL,Finland,"One of the issues I have been paying attention to recently has been indigenous land rights in Finland. 

As an example reindeer herding has been recognized as a traditional livelihood of the Sami people by the finnish state. Reindeer mainly eat lichens in winter and spring. Tree hanging lichen Bryoria Fuscescens is especially important to the reindeer reproductive cycle as the females are pregnant that time of year. Tree hanging lichen primarily occurs in old-growth forests, which tend to grow rather slowly in the arctic.

Despite the state's promises of respecting the Saami culture, the state-owned enterprise Metsähallitus continued industrial logging in herding grounds. Many locals saw logging as a means of employment and had little sympathy for herders when their own livelihood would have been at stake. The decades long dispute pretty much came to a close when Metsähallitus, pressured by Greenpeace and the UN human rights council, agreed to preserve around 80% of the disputed 107,000 hectare area in 2010.

It is my understanding that Norway has within the last decade had similar land right issues with their interpretation of ILO 169.

It's important, to begin with to look around. If you have not the right referencies (""female friends"") i can introduce them to you...(they all work, they are the majority..).
Secondly, the language factor. Outside Italy you have to learn one, two or more languages to enter the job market, so you ""start in disadvantage"". etc. etc. Third point: here (in italy) exist the true meritocracy. Outside italy it doesn't. In order to work you have to have studied in (prestigious) universities..here, we all (young people) have studied a lot (semi-obligatory school) and so we have not to be tested..(?!) abroad they test you with closed tests. Our training in the job is more practical than the foreign one. Fourth point. A really important and true thing: people abroad dress badly. This is a typical tract of italians; we invented it, the discovered the beauty, the blonde-black haired contrast (?!). Democratic and meritocratic way, again. In Italy exist a particular consideration in reguard of these aspects, for example, if you are a cool boy/girl and you can dress well, then you are preferred=&gt;meritocratic  (?!). fifth: the most important. Abroad you age sooner. (etc. etc. stupid examples). (i lost her logic connections). In Italy you can choose if go on public services=worse, or take your own/private services=better but not cheapy.

People here on reddit sure treat sanctions like it is one. Sanctions are being implemented and everyone screams ""they don't work, they are shit, MOAR!!!"". Reddit culture of immediate gratification dictates the narrative if things are not immediately go the way the consensus want them to be, its all ""we are doomed, nothing is working, Germany are selling out Eastern Europe for gas!"" Thus the gradual escalation in extremist views and desire to go further and further, but when would be a time for slow down, you won't have an opportunity already, since that train has long gone.


&gt;I'm still confused; what was the treaty you referred to breaking earlier?


Video game treaties, i made an analogy of what happens in games when treaties are broken and tried vaguely to point out that life is not a video game and things don't work they do on the screen. Sanctions = consequences, but they don't work immediately as a lot of people here seem to think, that is all i was trying to say.


&gt;Even now, there is talk about the sanctions being lifted next month if Russia can be seen to be facilitating a peaceful resolution to events. Europe has been bending over backwards not to hit Russia with hard sanctions.


I doubt it, Russian food import ban is 1 year long. Putin visited Latin America at what, July? How will it make him and his business partners in Russia look, if Russia lifts sanctions and fucks with Latin American suppliers? How will he look domestically? Sanctions are here to stay for at least half a year if not more, this is a case of ship long sailed. Supply lines are being established, Russia is seeking money &amp; possibly technologies/market opportunities in Asia, we are slowly drifting away from each other.


I agree that initial sanctions were pretty mild (slap on the wrist of Putin inner circle), but the ones which followed the suit are quite different from those. If you implement even harsher ones, well it might be not as their architects imagined they would work :)

As a Scot I personally don't see Spain refusing us entry to the EU given the issues that could cause. I believe a non-negligible number of Spanish as well as other EU ships fish in Scottish waters, I don't see them forfeiting that personally.

I also don't believe EU member states want the headache of creating rules for the removal of EU citizenship, loss of business or potentially having to deport Scottish citizens/accept their own back.

Our existing integration with the EU makes me firmly believe that our acceptance by the EU as a country of EU citizens is pretty much a formality of treaty nigotiations.

* After FR, DE and the NL are the countries least bothered by a UK exit
* the UK is third for unhappiness about immigrants after Spain and ~~Golden Dawnia~~ GR
* The UK, NL, FR, are the countries where the most people think immigrants are  benefit scroungers
* The majority in the UK think 1st generation immigrants are not integrating well (50% NO, 46% YES) - but not as bad GR (70%) and SE (65%)
* The UK is in the average for 2nd generation immigrants (SE remains the worse)
* After GR, the UK has the second highest number of people complaining there are too many immigrants without knowing the actual numbers (54%). They become the highest when the actual number of immigrants is revealed

""Ich habe erwartet, dass ich nur die Telefonanrufe beantworten und Kaffees holen müßte""

Notice that the main clause is just the usual perfect tense ""I have expected"" but the subordinating clause uses the Konjuntiv II 'tense' to express conditionality. That is why 'mussen' looks like the simple past (musste) but with an umlaut. KII is used to translate phases like ""would"" or ""could"" or ""should"". E.g.

&gt;Kaufte ich ein Auto, hätte ich weniger Geld. = If I bought a car, I would have less money.

But KII is weird, There are two ways of forming it; either it is simple past + an umlaut. Or you use the KII of the verb werden, which is würden, and an infinitive auxillary. So we could have written the sentance above as 

&gt;Wenn ich ein Auto kaufen würde, hätte ich weniger Geld.

However, some verbs always use the special form, e.g. haben -&gt; hätten, sein -&gt; wären. Some use it often but not always e.g. kommen -&gt; kämen, geben -&gt; gäben. Most others just use infinitive + würden.

true,RealSourLemonade,WALE,Cymru,"&gt;The question is how fast. When it comes to a quite large intervention, setup quickly, only the U.S can do that at a large scale, because of these, these and those.

The question is not how fast, it's how long and how far. 

It depends on what you mean by large scale.

As I said, 70,000 is large and both the UK and France are capable of deploying around that many anywhere.

Also the UK, France and the US are all a part of NATO, as such the UK and France are short in the strategical aircraft area because the US has prioritized those. If NATO did not exist and we weren't such close ally's with the US we would have many more of our own.

The US has by far the most power projection capabilities of any country, that is why I put it at the top of my power projection list... This is for two reasons. 

1. The US has such a large military budget, it's somewhat to be expected.

2. The EU (if we take it as a whole) has perhaps 50% the military budget of the US, however it does not have 50% the power projection capabilities, this is because many of the countries in the EU, during the Cold War, built large standing armies, to defend against a possible soviet invasion. For obvious reasons this is not something that would work for the US (The Atlantic dictates the US must be able to deploy troops over seas).

As such you have the US with the most power projection capabilities, followed by the UK and France. China and India currently are expanding their capabilities in this area.

&gt;because of these, these and those.

Je n'ai pas envie, pour pouvoir me payer un logement décent, de devoir en plus travailler plusieurs semaines par an ""gratuitement"" pour Kevin, 25 ans, qui ne branle rien et passe sa vie à jouer aux jeux vidéos sur son PC et a glander sur Reddit au lieu de se former, de lire des bouquins et de construire son expérience professionnelle pour contribuer à la société d'une façon un peu en rapport à ce qu'il reçoit.


Rappel, ne rien apporter à la société alors qu'on le pourrait, au final il reste moins à partager pour ceux qui sont VRAIMENT dans le besoin (pas de qualif, handicapés, retraités, en recherche active d'emploi...). C'est donc une pure forme d'égoïsme. Et tenter de rationaliser ça en 6 bonnes raisons, c'est juste se mentir à soi-même.

People often cite the UK challenge to the bonus regime as an issue. However, there are several legitimate reasons for this challenge which the Treasury outlined. The EC has not responded to these points. Also I would point out that the UK has proposed the toughest bonus clawback regime in the world (7 years clawback), this goes far beyond anything else in Europe.

The financial transaction tax has significant issues (see Sweden). The UK also already has other taxes in place (share tax) which do a similar job better. 

The problem with a lot of European financial policy which the UK ends up opposing (bonuses, FTT etc.), is that it is done on the basis of populism instead of sound economic policy.

The immigrants in a country likely went there because something over there WORKS BETTER than at home. I don't think that they would want to make their new country a part of their old one by default. They might want to have a relationship with their home country but not necessarily make their new home just like the old one that they left.

I'm talking about a civilized and educated people having a right to choose how they are governed. If the 30% are heavily disadvantaged by the other 70% that is not fair. It's not like 30% of a country's population (ignoring ethnicity) can move out and find a suitable new home. Smaller percentages can migrate to where they would feel better treated so minorities below 2% I'm ignoring, since they can likely just move.

It is a flawed argument because it is based on the premise that there is no resentment/hatred between the peoples and that a peaceful agreement can be reached. This would have to be respected by the majority.

By the way, the US's particular form of republican government is constructed to explicitly restrict the ability of the majority to govern at will. Good democratic government does *not* respect the majority simply because being the majority gives you unlimited moral authority--it doesn't, and recognition of this fact has profoundly influenced the course of US history, especially in the 20th century (cf. the Civil Rights Movement, but also, of course, the post-Civil War constitutional amendements, Women's Suffrage, the 1964 Civil Rights act itself, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which allowed the federal government explicitly to intercede and nullify the actions of state governments--even policies arrived at by democratic means, in areas normally reserved to the authority of the states, like voting rights--if they violated princples of basic fairness). Then there's filibusters, the structure of the legislative branch, the principle of judicial review... I could go on.

The point is, ""The majority wants X"" is not a basis for sound or ethical government. ""The inhabitants of Madrid are attached the the pretty shape Spain makes on a map"" is not a justification for the rest of Spain to forbid Catalonia the opportunity for self-determination, and any such justification has to account for the fact that in the modern theory of democratic government (which I think we can assume applies in Western Europe) self-determination is the whole justification for the power government wields in the first place. That Spain isn't allowing a Catalonian referendum is in fact (in my opinion) *deeply harmful* to the moral authority of the Spanish state, similar in kind (albeit not degree) to Russia's annexation of Crimea. And if Spain's only recourse is to petulantly forbid Catalonia to even express an opinion via a nonbinding vote, and not even try to convince the Catalonians that it's worth it to stay part of Spain, then that's all the more reason why, if I were Catalan, I would want even *more* to be independent.",0,1410474970,null,0,false,0,ckfrd6i,t3_2g2i0i,t1_ckfrd6i,t1_ckffnsp,null,1427063999,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

To strengthen the EU position and to avoid being dependent on Russia any more than Germany already is, it makes sense to support these kind of developments, similar to how Germany supported Euratom.

&gt; That cheap price keeps Germany trapped and in Russia's pocket...

That's just Merkel doing whatever gets her elected for another four years. Public opinion on atomic energy in Germany has always been extremely low for whatever reason.

In Cologne, besides the [Cathedral of Cologne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Cologne) there are many other churches. Check out for instance the [St. Ursula Basilica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_St._Ursula,_Cologne) which has walls embellished with human bones. (See the article)

In Cologne, there is also [Odonien](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odo_Rumpf) (article in German, but pictures are worth to take a quick look) which serves as a bar / disco etc. Check their website for events!

(I don't mention the [Chandelier in the Cologne Sewage System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_sewerage_system) here, as it's only accessible with a guide)

Here in Germany, I believe we have a duty to uphold the fight against fascism; museums can be found all over the place. I recommend to visit a concentration camp such as [Buchenwald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchenwald_concentration_camp) or in Cologne the [EL-DE Haus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EL-DE_Haus).

Buchenwald is very close to [Weimar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar), a city that was home to the two most famous poets - Goethe and Schiller - as well as birthplace of the ""Weimar Republic"".

In southern parts of Germany there are many ""Klams"" (slot canyons?), such as the [Breitachklam](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitachklamm) beautiful and safe!


Other cities not on everybodys list includes [Leipzig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig) (check out the [Monument to the Battle of Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_Battle_of_the_Nations)!!!) and [Erfurt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erfurt) as well as [Kassel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassel) (especially worth seeing is the [Hercules monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_monument_(Kassel) )


As always, make sure to eat decent *local* food, not fast-food bullshit. Tripadvisor may give you an idea of what to eat and where to eat. German beer is a good call but you may also try to find out about other drinks, such as ""Radler"" (shandy). Make sure to order different kinds of German bread in a real bakery (do NOT buy at chains or supermarkets if you want the best bread around).

Oh, and there are some more attractions:

* Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven and capital of West Germany. I deem the ""Haus der Geschichte"" (House of History) easily to be one of the best museums I've ever been to. [Haus der Geschichte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_der_Geschichte)

--&gt; In Bonn, you may want to visit the Haribo Factory store ;-)

* Ride the train from Cologne to Koblenz, there are many castles on this tour along the river.


Most people (especially those from the US) are crazy about castles. I think there are specific websites about where to find castles and palaces; sorry I'm to lazy right now to link to that as well :)

Oh and for those who like adventures: Take a look at the [Europa-Park Theme Park in Rust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa-Park), voted as the No. 1 Theme Park *worldwide* by www.themeparkreview.com (when sorted by ""TPR Rating"") and No. 3 when sorted by ""Members ranking"".

He's one of those people, but he also knows that most of his voters aren't.

According to a survey 83% of Hungarians have not left the country in the past 12 months. For a vast majority life and the universe can only be defined as something centered around Hungary.

Brussels making a fuss? Must be because they hate Hungarians. Slovakians not doing everything ethnic Hungarians demand? That's because they are anti-Hungarian. Obama not meeting with Orbán? Because they are angry at us for not conforming to their liberal ideals. 

Everything and everyone is anti-Hungarian and nothing else. His voters can only imagine a world where every non-Hungarian and non-ERHMAGERDHDSOHUNGARIAN (liberals, sexual and ethnic minorities or basically anyone disagreeing with them in Hungary) actors are caricatures of a person. Only they are real people with real feeling, all their enemies are two-dimensional cartoon villains. 

He plays along this tune with a mix of faux nationalism, populism with the added charisma he certainly carries. Enough people buy his shit so he remains in power.

I absolutely agree with this: people refuse to accept that other people can think outside the constraints of our nation, to offer constructive criticism instead of knee-jerk reactions, to do something proactive instead of reactive.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;I was talking about entering a market. It would be easier for an insurance company to enter a new market than a healthcare service provider.

Perhaps. But not impossible. You can privatise public services, sell public infrastructure to private companies or turn over public services for private management. All of these have been done in Finland during the past 15 years due to neoliberal belief that private is always more cost-effective than public. 

Should this belief turn out to be false, the FTA as it exists in publicised drafts would stop Finnish counties from buying the services back, founding a new service to replace the sold or from waiting for the contract to expire. 

&gt;No state systems were dismantled under any other FTAs. Im confident European regulators would not let that happen with virtually 100% certainty.

You forget that neoliberals don't exist just in the States. Certain people are more than happy to let certain things slide through the fingers and then blame it on a work-mishap or EU bureaucracy. 

&gt;You mention it is a violation of the democratic process, but all affected countries have to ratify it. Almost all cross border deals are first negotiated behind closed doors.

And seldom subjected to democratic discussion. Just that things have been done this way doesn't mean they SHOULD be done this way. 

&gt;The Canadian deal was and it contains an investor state dispute clause (virtually all FTAs do). Yet that was welcome with open arms. 

By whom? Why? 

&gt;No anger over this deal despite the fact Japanese tech giant Fujitsu recently won a £700 million judgment against the NHS for backing out of a deal (based on contract law, not a free trade agreement).

Why isn't there anger? 

&gt; I don't know of one example of an FTA that has been publicly negotiated (although they have to be ratified by legislatures, which gives the public a chance to comment).

Usually the negotiators are given a limited writ to do negotiate from parliament. This time parliaments aren't even allowed to look at the drafts. Further, when negotiations are finished, the political pressure to sign is much greater than the pressure to renegotiate (which would mean opening the whole agreement, undoing years of work). 

&gt;TTIP would likely be fairly standard sharing many of the same characteristics as the Canadian and Japanese deal. Clearly the only reason people are upset is because it is being negotiated with the US.

You write all the above that you did and then you have the guts to say it's only because it's with the USA..

&gt;Case in point, as I mentioned above, I have not seen one thread on the deal with Japan.

Just because you haven't seen doesn't mean it doesn't exist (do you read Japanese and follow Japanese media extensively?). Just because it isn't discussed doesn't mean it SHOULDN'T be discussed or that not not being discussed it something that people would regret later.

&gt;In [Spanish dialectology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dialects_and_varieties), the terms ___distinción___, ___seseo___ and ___ceceo___ are used to describe the opposition between dialects that distinguish the [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) /θ/ and /s/, and those that exhibit [merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_(phonology\)) of the two sounds (*neutralización*) into either /s/ (*seseo*) or [s̄], a sibilant fricative similar to /θ/ (*ceceo*).

&gt;Dialects that distinguish the two sounds, and thus pronounce the words *casa* ""house"" and *caza* ""hunt"" differently, are described as having *distinción*, whereas the dialects that lack this distinction and pronounce the two words as [homophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone) are described as having *seseo* if both words are pronounced with [s] or *ceceo* if both words are pronounced with [s̄].

&gt;*Seseo* is typical of the [Latin American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America) and [Canarian dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canarian_Spanish) and some dialects of central [Andalusia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), whereas *distinción* is typical of most dialects in Spain, except in much of Andalusia and the Canary Islands. *Ceceo* is found in some dialects of Spain, in the southernmost part of Andalusia.

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"&gt; Okay two points:
You asked me ""Why is everyone so sure this would end if Russia agreed to demands?"" I told you why; because the EU are setting the sanctions and they have stated repeatedly that they will lift them if Russia accedes.
Was that question in bad faith? Because now you are talking about imperialism.


This is not a logical issue for Russia but an emotional one, in Russian media this conflict already shifted to a matter of ""prestige"" and if Putin&amp;co bends over, it is equivalent of political suicide for him. This is not a matter of how i describe anything, but how *russian public and officials* view Ukraine. Nothing more, nothing less. 


To put it simple, i **highly doubt** that your proposal of Russia completely pulling out of Ukraine and a paying reparations will be accepted by any party involved. 


I am not going to argue that EU is better for Ukraine, since i am not a supporter of Russian ""adventures"" in South-Eastern Ukraine. I posted my views back when Euromaidan only started and wondered why we even need them and what are our long term strategical goals or directives. As far as nowadays Ukraine goes, i want nothing to do with it, its a country on the brink of economic disaster which will cost an enormous amount of money to fix, i want Russia nothing to do with that.


&gt;If one country invades another and helps destroy parts of it then they should be expected to pay reparations. It happened in World War 2. It happened to the USA in Iraq and Afghanistan, costing their economy billions and billions of dollars. Why shouldn't Russia pay for invading? It makes no sense.


Russia paying reparations is an insult which no Russian will *ever* tolerate in Russian mindset (as far as i can tell). Not going to happen.


&gt;Let me put this in context for you; Russia is being asked to pull it's army out of a peaceful country that it has invaded and stop backing the insurgency that is costing the citizens of that country their lives, and you are telling me this is asking Russia to roll over and die?


European jihadists travel to Syria to fight Assad or establish Islamic caliphate through Turkey (zero obstacles on the border and probably is encouraged by them) with money and support from Gulf states and full knowledge of U.S intelligence. Russian jihadists travel to Ukraine to fight what they perceive as ""insert required propaganda here"". I will not deny that Russia is involved heavily in South-East, but the amount of Russian troops involved is vastly overestimated. You can think of them as ""advisors being deployed"", since you are from West and probably heard that phrase once or twice. Since Russia lacks puppets or client-states and is acting against a somewhat united U.S+EU combo, it had to resort to ""not so covert means"".


The reasons for Russian invasion are only known to Putin and his inner circle, i am not in it unfortunately, so i cannot give you an insight what he is thinking and why does he acted the way he did. The main topic is Russia is not satisfied with current Ukrainian establishment and want ""regime change"" for whatever the reasons, the fact that we resorted to such means is not a sign of strength, but weakness as you pointed out previously. Completely loosing face domestically would be devastating and Russia is lacking in terms of ""prominent capable opposition leaders"". Who is going to replace mr.Putin?


&gt;I'm going to give you a chance to explain yourself about this.


I tried in the part above, this issue is no longer logical one and will have huge impact on domestic audience, the idea of Russia paying reparations is like a spit in the face of Russian population. Whoever would come up with it would immediately be lynched.

Treaty of Versailles was one of the main reasons for Nazi Germany to appear, Russia has quite a number of similarities with pre WW2 Germany already, if history is any indication - things might get worse is an understatement. One of the reasons would also be the way West treated Russia after Soviet Union collapse - something like ""no one is forgotten, nothing is forgiven/forgotten"".


&gt;I'm not following the Syrian crisis so I don't feel knowledgeable enough to talk about it. You can check my post history if you like, it's simply not something I'm currently interested in.


http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/qatars-support-of-extremists-alienates-allies-near-and-far.html?_r=0


read between the lines, how come Turkey border is not secured? How come there are no outrages or media hype? How is it fine to arm ""moderates"" who later have a tendency to become ISIS, but Russia doing what it considers in its own national interest is unjust? (this is me speculating, i obviously don't have a complete picture)


&gt;I'm sorry, what officials are you talking about? I'm not denying they went there, if any did, I just can't think of any off the top of my head. I will say that relations with Turkey have been extremely cool for a long time with several member states strongly opposed to including them in the EU, so I'm not sure why you would expect EU involvement in Turkish protests. The EU is simply not interested in including Turkey on certain levels.


there is a russian joke for that - ""Once upon a time ambassadors of United States, France, Spain, Germany and Denmark; secretary of state staff member Victoria Nuland; american senators Cris Merphy and John McCain; minister of foreign relations of Germany Guido Westerwelle; High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton; former Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili; minister of foreign affairs of Netherlands Frans Timmermans; european mp Yacek Protacevich; minister of foreign affairs of Lithuania Linas Linkyavichous; speaker of Lithuanian seim Loretta Grauzhinene; former prime minister of Poland Yaroslav Kazcynski; senator of Czech Republic Yaromir Shtenina gathered on Maidan and - accused Russia of meddling in Ukraine internal affairs.""


The reason i bring Turkey &amp; a constant support of EuroMaidan in Western press (favorable coverage, NGOs and other shit) is to indicate that perhaps you were quite interested in a certain outcome, pursuing your interests. 


As for the part about rewarding Russia, i never said anything like that, what i suggested is giving Russia a way out, not a complete humiliation which would backfire domestically tremendously. 


&gt;I have been polite to you about this and argued in good faith while backing up reasoning as logically and reasonably as I can while seeking not to offend your sensibilities. If you continue to be snide to me, that won't happen again.


I tried to be polite and argue in good faith as well , but the stuff i've been reading between lines here and in other treads gave me an impression that the way Europe + U.S envision the conclusion of the conflict slightly deviates from Russian political reality. If i offended you, i apologize, this was not my intention; if i read between lines a little too much, i apologize as well, force of habit to look at things through different perspective/prism.


&gt;Now, to deal with your final point, as impolitely as you phrased it: there is no reason for Ukraine not to seek closer ties with the EU. There is no reason for the EU to stop Ukraine doing this. Russia openly invaded Ukraine and continues to occupy and attack it. There is no going back to Russian hegemony for Ukraine.


Which is why i questioned Putins actions as soon as Crimea was announced and wondered why are we completely ruining our relations with Ukraine and Europe for decades to come. I also wondered about the consequences of Russia's actions around the globe, the precedent of protecting ""oppressed minorities"" in 21st century with China's newfound hobby of cartography and others. 


I am not anti-EU, ""fuck the West"" type of guy, but i fail to see the conclusion of the current conflict any time soon, given the rhetoric and ongoing trends. This is a talk of deaf person with a blind man, reality for both of them slightly deviates from their respective vision.

This sentiment appears in other areas of art as well: people getting appointed to similar director positions based on political loyalty instead of having a clear-cut vision for the institute they are about to govern, alternative theater groups getting de-funded because they are staging political plays, artists without the 'right' credentials not getting any opportunity to appear in exhibitions, events, newspapers, etc. unless they demonstrate what they want to see.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; FTA as it exists in publicised drafts would stop Finnish counties from buying the services back

That is not typically how ISDs work. Finland would have to pay back any investment a company made before the industry was nationalized. Given that, some protections already exist. The Fujitsu GBP700 million judgement for the NHS shows many of these protections already exist. It would essentially apply these protections to the entire block, although I would assume most of the more developed countries in the EU already have these protections. It does not give companies free reign. For example, Canada has state providers but also private insurance. Most Canadians have private supplemental insurance as well, and you have not seen US companies overrun Canada. Either at the provider level or insurance level. 

&gt;You forget that neoliberals don't exist just in the States. Certain people are more than happy to let certain things slide through the fingers and then blame it on a work-mishap or EU bureaucracy.

You have to remember *all* member states have to ratify it. If there is any funny business like that it will not pass through the parliaments of all EU countries, and therefore it would be invalid for all countries. It would have to be acceptable to everyone at the national level to pass, so it can not be too radical. Middle ground harmonizations for certain industries but nothing that would amount to tearing apart European heath or education systems. Even if it passed in Finland, unless it would pass in France, Germany, Italy, etc. it would be invalid for Finland even if they passed it.  

&gt;Just that things have been done this way doesn't mean they SHOULD be done this way.

I personally prefer it this way. Given the amount of lobbyists Brussels and Washington have, I am glad they do it behind closed doors then put it to a vote. If there is something unpopular with the populace local parliaments will have a good excuse not to ratify, but will be pressured to ignore lobbyists unless they are willing to admit they are going to allow an EU deal fail due to lobbying. 

&gt;Why isn't there anger?

That is a fantastic question. The only anger I have seen over it has been when people incorrectly attribute it to investor-state dispute clauses and say this is what Europe has to look forward to if TTIP is passed (which they didn't sue under an FTA or ISD clause anyway, simple contracts case). I can only guess it is because it is not a US company. If it was google I can only imagine the front page of this sub talking about how awful the US and its companies are. 

&gt;You write all the above that you did and then you have the guts to say it's only because it's with the USA..

I am talking about opposition to the Japanese agreement from the European public. Given it is similar to TTIP but there is zero outrage, yes, I think it is safe to say it is because TTIP is an agreement with the US. Not only that but a similar deal with Canada was not protested, but celebrated, despite containing an investor-state dispute clause. It is almost guaranteed the Japanese deal also contains an ISD clause, bu there is no outrage.

They just don't want the uncertainty. Uncertainty is a business killer so any doubt about the stability of the UK's government or economy or currency will all push investors away to the many many other places which are less unstable. When they predict economic problems they often mean economic problems for themselves. Now, economic problems for major companies in small countries can be really bad - Ireland is the perfect example. I think people are right to say there won't be economic armageddon for Scottish people and this has been overblown by the NO campaign. However it might harm Scottish businesses which would in turn hurt the Scottish economy. Much will then rest on how Salmond responds to the instability after independence to regain the type of investor confidence that the UK enjoys right now and that will be a long process that will take 5-10 years to play out. Saying there will be no harm done at all is to say that the constitutional arrangement of the UK is not significant particularly those people that stake their own money on the performance of Scotland and it's economy, namely international investors - ergo it's stupid. Of course there will be harm (both to Scotland and the UK) but Scotland's future will either be a slow recovery or slow decline. Any prediction of a massive earthquake moment is wrong I think.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"The reality is that the working class is doomed either way. 

You stay in the EU and you risk getting undercut by other, poorer workers from other parts of the EU terkin yer jerbs. The EU is also fairly neoliberal and the Juncker Commission is not going to improve that trend. 

On the flip side, what do you think will happen if you leave the EU? The Tories were the original champions of free market neoliberalism and, if anything they've gotten a bit worse since the Thatcher era. You're not going to change these fundamentally anti-worker policies, especially with the rise of New Labour and the death of red Labour, and UKIP is possibly worse than even the Tories, as they proscribe a ""Libertarian"" stance(i.e. deregulation, deregulation, deregulation). 

The issue here is not the EU. If you stay in the EU, you're not going to solve the problems. If you leave the EU, that is also not going to solve the problems. This is not a matter of the EU's influence, it's a matter of fundamental policy on every level - but *primarily* on the national level in Westminster. 

If I were an English worker, I would advocate staying in the EU, not for what it does now, but for the future further integration. Yeah, your country is going to lose some of its sovreignty, probably most of it in a Federal EU. So what? It's not like you, the average working class joe, are in charge of anything in your country anyways. Whether its from Brussels or London, the government is going to be a load of disconnected fucks that don't understand the plight of the working class. What staying in the EU does is allow a framework to be created that could potentially, down the line, favour the working class people. 

With that said, it's terrible but I don't think there's ever going to be a real improvement as a working class person in either situation. We're going to get undercut on a global scale as time goes on - first it's China, but soon when Africa starts coming into its own, it'll be them. And there's nothing we can do about that except either massively degrade our living quality or fundamentally change the economic system. 

However, the EU also provides a safety net of regulations - and it's these regulations that make UKIP want to leave the EU, they can't deregulate if there's a supranational entity telling them they're not allowed to. The EU is neoliberal, but it isn't far gone or even that far down the road of neoliberalism, so the workers are still gaining benefits from more regulations akin to a Social Democracy. 

So those workers who are employed will benefit, but those who are not will actually be penalized as job growth using standard methodology(Attracting Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) and encouraging Small &amp; Medium Enterprise(SME)) will be more difficult due to these regulations making it more expensive for businesses, as such they'll probably just leave the country to get cheaper labour elsewhere(cus they're a load of greedy pricks).  

I think I went off on a bit of a tangent. Anyways, the long story short is that when it comes to the lot of the workers, the EU isn't really the primary issue here. It *can* help in many cases, but it can also be indirectly detrimental as a result of that.",0,1410479728,null,0,false,0,ckftlvj,t3_2g5bn5,t1_ckftlvj,t3_2g5bn5,null,1427062702,82,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,82

To compare, the UK governments expenditure for the [same year was £671 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_Kingdom_budget). 

Some advantages: 
No customs, mostly. 
Single currency for the Eurozone, so no messing around in banks with exchange rates etc. 
65 years of peace. 
Single market means a reduction in cross border taxes, cheaper stuff like my personal favorite Red wine. 
I'm Irish so I don't know how much this applies to the UK but EU directives/laws towards the Environment, worker rights and human rights have been generaly progressive and inclusive in Ireland.

Some Disadvantages:
There is democratic deficit at European level politics, the best solution to this problem would be to move to a fully federal system which I suspect is what the Eurosceptics Europe wide are afraid off and all the square banana and health &amp; safety scare stories are really about drumming up opposition to the EU for this reason.

It's true that we currently have more people than jobs, but adding more workers to the economy keeps wages low and makes workers more willing to put up with poor working conditions. The economic recovery is still very fragile and we need low wages to maintain profits.

Because I feel it's important in the context of this discussion: I'm American.

If you think having a unique history and culture as a people qualifies that people to be an independent state, then how does Texas *not* meet your requirements? (I'm not a separatist, nor a Texan, but hear me out.) Consider:

1\. The people of Texas have a long history. There were at one point in time [its own nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas). Certainly, it existed for a short time, but it has a very rich history in terms of its founding, the wars its people fought to establish and defend it from becoming part of the US as a whole, and in the fact that the former nation's culture still influences Texas' culture today. Texas is called the Lone Star State. From wikipedia, ""Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico.""

2\. The people of Texas not only could support themselves on their own, but would be quite a rich nation - a lot of our oil comes from Texas. On top of this, Texans who support separation believe they would be able to handle Texan issues better than the US government has been doing. Namely, illegal immigration and related crimes are a huge problem in Texas.

Texas is [HUGE](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr02/2012/11/16/17/enhanced-buzz-wide-28632-1353103917-7.jpg), and has a population of about 27 million. 27 million people that *very well may* be able to do better for themselves as a sovereign state than as a member of the union. 

3\. Texas has its own culture. It may be the subject of mockery, but like any other place there is good and bad that could be said about it. Regardless, it DOES have a unique cultural identity.

Given the aforementioned points how is Texas a good argument *against* independence movements? Further, who are you, as a non-Texan, to determine whether their wish for independence is legitimate or not? 

As a non-Catalan, what qualifies you to determine whether they should want their independence or not?

But don't *ever* argue that the law has superior moral authority just because it's the law. That argument is essentially authoritarian and has no intrinsic merit. Bad laws ought to be changed, and where they create excessive hardship, should not be enforced. Much of the debate *about* US immigration law boils down to one side pointing out that US immigration law as it stands is unjust. We've gotten to the point where call centers in Mexico can rely on enough people being deported from the U.S. (who grew up in the US, who have no personal or cultural ties to Mexico, except they were born there, who don't speak Spanish) that ""English monoglot who grew up in the US but happens to have Mexican citizenship"" is a defined niche in the Mexican job market. Frankly, I think that's fucked up. I also think denying 11 million people (3.5% or so of the population) who contribute to your economy and who pay taxes (sales and payroll certainly, if not income) access to civic participation and social welfare programs is even *more* fucked up.

All this predicated on, what, the fear the US will run out money? Jobs? That the third-biggest country on the planet by population, the fourth biggest by size, and the hands-down largest economy, can't afford to treat immigrants better? The US didn't even have laws restricting immigration for the first century of its existence, and only created them because of explicit racism against the Chinese (it was called the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act), and used this as the basis for a racist quota system until the 60s. It can't plausibly be argued that US immigration law isn't steeped in racism from the beginning, and that this attitude doesn't continue to affect public policy and debates about that policy. There were Republican politicians calling the child refugees over the summer disease-ridden vermin, and you think this is a debate about enforcing the *law*?

If they accepted conditions of that kind in exchange for their independence, that is not independence at all. 

They can, freely and independently of having their sovereignty, confer authority over any matter including these mentioned to an international authority however. And will do so if they join/remain in the EU in a fair number of areas, just as intimate to the sovereignty of a country. 

There is further no such thing as channeling foreign policy of the EU member states - they're not cats one needs to herd to a goal someone else sets - rather they are equal negotiators drafting a common document, over which all have a veto. 

Now as to the outcomes we hope for and seek, like majority voting in foreign policy in the EU and a common defense (which I see as essential, NATO fairly optional and subject to political whims of the electorate) - I'd fully support them, but the procedure for getting them is clear. Luckily not a treaty revision, but just a unanimous vote in the european council, or a coalition of the willing unanimous to do so. 

If the pressures - ie difficulty and weakness of unanimity combined with the need for more effective action to protect their own interests - continue to pile up, such a vote might even happen.

Probably not as long as the UK is a member, and other countries continue to be keen on keeping it as integrated as possible. Especially on foreign policy and defense.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I think, looking at this from the perspective of a blue collar worker, or someone who is lowly qualified and in the service industry (and I do not say English because these arguments apply to a lot of different countries), there are two strands to the pro-EU argument that I would pick up on. Obviously there are benefits to you which do *not* concern you being working class (such as environmentalism, space, consumer protection and reduced trade barriers which are areas the EU has a huge positive influence in and much more besides) and this is often enough to make people pro-EU on its own, but you will hear these arguments elsewhere (and I have written such arguments elsewhere). 

The two strands I think you have to consider is firstly and quite obviously, the role the EU plays in ensuring you rights that you would not otherwise have. The big thing I am going to point out is [the EU working time directive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Time_Directive) which ensures that you cannot be worked to death for 13 hours everyday by your employer and that you have to be given breaks. If employers were allowed to do this it would lead to a race to the bottom where the working class get fucked over because they need money to live and so get forced into jobs with awful hours because otherwise someone more desperate will come along and take the job and you're left with no work. 

There's also some things in the [European Convention on Human Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) which protect employees. For instance, the right to freedom from discrimination. Obviously, the European Convention and the European Union are different, but the European Union demands that each of its members has ratified and complies with the European Convention and if the UK broke with the ECHR, (which many Conservatives want to, including Teresa May, second most powerful person in the country after only David Cameron and I think Cameron has also made murmurs in that direction) then the UK would be banished from the EU, meaning the EU is ensuring your right to freedom from discrimination, and other things. 

However, time for the second strand of the argument, the EU also does many things which are *ostensibly* damaging to the working classes in [rich] Western European countries. What I am talking about, of course, is EU migrants moving from [poor] Eastern European countries and into Western European ones, and depressing wages for manual and service jobs. This is one of the main UKIP issues. But the thing is, the immigration problem, as well as many other problems, are not really problems with the EU, but problems of our time. They are problems of globalisation. Now, globalisation brings problems such as high movement of people from a variety of regions, but in the modern World this large level of movement is not something which can be stopped without making *huge* economic sacrifices which *will* hurt is in the GDP and ultimately make the working classes poorer than they would have been, had this movement of labour continued. We can't shut out economies off anymore. They need to be opened up, or face stagnation of economic growth and living standards and maybe even recessions. So, Nigel Farage and such like are effectively arguing for an untenable position, and they know this. This is why they don't argue for leaving the European Project *completely*. They argue to stay in the European Economic Area like Norway, Iceland and Switzerland are, but the problem *then* is that most of the problems of globalisation are still biting at our ankles but we no longer have the worker protection that I talked about in the first strand of the argument, like ECHR stuff (because we'll opt straight out of that) and the Working Time Directive, as well as many other examples (I only pick on those two specifically because they are big pieces of legislation which are easy to understand, a lot of the really beneficial stuff is hidden in the small print of complex documents). 

So, there are some good examples of the EU's work protection, but there is also not much of a viable alternative to the problems Mr Farage and the EUskeptics talk about. ",0,1410481322,null,0,1410481879,0,ckfud2a,t3_2g5bn5,t1_ckfud2a,t3_2g5bn5,null,1427062197,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

This one gets tritted around a lot, but I don't really see it. The amount of democratic legitimacy the EU itself has is pretty directly proportional to how much power it has. I mean, if you look at how much power the EU has acquired over time, the amount of democratic elements and the power of those elements has increased significantly. And lets not forget, that ultimately, the leaders of national governments are in control and so the *entire European project* derives huge levels of democratic legitimacy from them. As European leaders give more power to the European Union (which has historically been the trend for the last 60 years), the EU loses a tiny bit of legitimacy because it is no longer deriving it from the national governments, so in order to counter balance that, the EU creates twice as much democracy as was derived from the member states.

Once it becomes cheaper to replace the working class with robots, it will happen.  Then it will happen to other jobs.

Once machines can understand natural languages, we could get rid of lawyers and judges.

true,gahmex,null,null,"I don't think autonomy or independence are wrong. I fact I think the smaller the states the better (that way people have better access to their governemnts).

It's national identities that I think are wrong. It's great to have a cultural identity, in fact people often have several. As someone from southern Spain I'm sevillian, andalucían, Spanish, european, and western. There are more things that define me as well, but it's a huge list. You get the point: we all have a lot of things we identify with.

What nationalism is though is taking a specific cultural identity and telling people who feel identified with it ""hey, you should have a state of your own"". 

Problem number one, this ignores all other forms of identity: it's saying this one identity is so important it needs a government and administration for itself where all the others aren't. 

Problem number two: where does this right to have a state even arise from? Why should all these people who have a common identity share a goverment? There is no logical reasoning behind it, it is only the result of history. And by history I mean people conquering and ruling other people by the force. Europe showcases a few fine examples of how nationalism initially arose as a way for the elite to brainwash the people into thinking it's them that should be ruling, and not someone else.

Why does nationalism arise though? Because at the time (think 18th-19th century, sort of) people were starting to have ideas of democracy and civil rights. Their systems of government at the time, absolute monarchies, here simply the result of certain people winning wars and making money and then deciding to take power. So how did these ruling people justify being in power now that people were wondering why it wasn't themselves who were in power? They went like: everyone under our rule are a single people. By people they mean a bunch of individuals who supposedly have a common will.

Now this is great for the ruling elite: they can manipulate these people into voting them and them, ta dah! Intead of they being in power because of money and wars, they are now in power because of the people's will! Isn't that a lot better? Of course it doesn't always work out for them and often the elite gets voted out of power, but you get the idea. The gist is: nationalism is an economic and political elite using a cultural identity to justify itself.

We have loads of evidence for all this. Spain is actually a great example of how nationalism is a political construct designed by the elites. Take Spanish nationalism and the two most important nationalism within the country: Basque and Catalan. 

Let's analyze Spanish nationalism. It's the idea that all these people share a common will. What people, you may ask? Well, the ones who after centuries of conquer and gaining and losing land ended up being ruled by the Bourbons. Now the bourbons rule a pretty varied country, but supposedly all these people share a common identity. You have Galician people who are obviously closer to the portuguese having to identify with people from the Basque country (who culturally have more in common with other basques), with people from Castille, with people from Melilla, and even with peole from de Canary Islands. What do you think happened here: all these people decided to join hands and become one people, or did they have a ruler before hand that had an interest in having all these people think they were one people?

Now let's look at other nationalisms within Spain. As I said Galicians and Canarians are pretty different, obviously. But they don't have a strong nationalism like the Basques and the Catalans. Do you think it's a coincidence that Catalanoia and Euskadi are the richest regions in the country and Galicia and the Canary Islands among the poorest? Hint: it's not. Industrialization in Catalonia and the Basque country created an eocnomic elite that still had to submit to the rules imposed from Madrid. They don't like this, of course: they have to go all the way to Madrid in order to influence the government so that they can have laws that benefit them. What's the solution, then? Well look, people in these industrialized regions have a culture of their own! Let's make this cultural identity into a national identity! That way the economic elites that arose from industrialization can mess with the governemnt more comfortably.


I know this is all very simplistic but this topic is really long and complicated. I'm studying politica science so I can recommend some stuff to read if you think this whole deal is interesting (I find it fascinating).

* First, the EU tries to make Europe more productive, so that businesses can produce higher value more easily. In theory, if workers are more productive, they have more power, and higher wages. It's not all that political in terms of redistributing wealth, the idea is more 'a rising tide raises all ships', if you see what I mean. The EU attempts to do this through various methods, for instance, investing in improvements in power systems, transportation, trying in general to make trade more efficient. This clearly works to some degree - to take an extreme example, one reason why people are poor in Africa and wealthy in Northern Europe is because our infrastructure is much better - if you work in a factory which is closes half the time because of power cuts, the business can't make enough money to pay decent wages. But the problem is this can look quite a lot like the EU is only interested in increasing business profits, and a lot of people say they are too receptive to lobbying from industrial interests.

* Second, the EU tries to balance this out by having strong worker rights to limit how much individuals can be exploited by their employers. As you say, people talk about taking rights away, but in general the EU's major role is in forcing countries to give minimum standards of rights, which more right wing countries like Britain would want to remove. But then, the UK opts out of many of these, so they may not have much impact.

I would also mention Hindi and Urdu languages (which are spoken literally by hundreds of millions of speakers, and are fully mutually intelligible), Bulgarian and Macedonian, Ukranian and Rusyn, Malaysian and Indonesian, etc. There are numerous examples of languages which can be considered just dialects of the same language but are nevertheless classified as separate for no better reason than the fact that native speakers belong to separate population groups - nationally, culturally, religiously, or any number of other factors. In that sense, so-called serbo-croatian is curious only insofar that these separate dialects coverged due to political circumstances at one point, and then diverged some time later, again due to politics, but this happened recently enough that the differences between standard languages are still small enough that for some linguists it's easier to treat it as one language rather than two (or four). Still, language is a living thing, it changes and reinvents itself constantly. It's undoubtable that serbian and croatian will drift further apart now that there are two competing language authorities, but more than this, for dialects to converge there needs to be vigorous cultural exchange. This existed in Yugoslavia when Serbs read Croatian books, watched Croatian movies and visited or lived in Croatian cities and vice-versa. Today, when there is bitterness and resentment, and almost no cultural exchange (compared to 30 years ago), there is no driving force that keeps the languages close. Of course, things won't change overnight, and serbian and croatian languages will surely still be very much mutually intelligible in 50 years, but at some point in the not so far future linguists will have to ""concede defeat"" and treat these languages as separate and distinct.",0,1410483630,null,0,false,0,ckfvi4m,t3_2g2m74,t1_ckfvi4m,t1_ckfggry,null,1427061366,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The vibe I get from you is that your coworkers vote UKIP as a way of saying no but have they ever considered that the powers that be are way ahead of them and are probably manipulating them to do exactly that. Because of course, positions can all be figured out by computer and the electorate sliced and diced by wedge issues. Thats what they do here in America. 


Don't let them privatize the NHS. Here in the US, the forced privatization of healthcare is costing each American (from what i can tell) around $300,000 more than an identically situated Canadian for health insurance and (potentially huge) out of pocket costs. The amount of extra, additional money thats spent involuntarily on the for profit system is difficult to calculate because it requires knowing the healthcare inflation rate since 2000 which is debatable, but it is at least $250000-$300000 over their lifetime, in today's money, probably more, and for that most Americans get increasingly abysmal, abbreviated health care.

&gt; As someone from southern Spain I'm sevillian, andalucían, Spanish, european, and western. There are more things that define me as well, but it's a huge list. You get the point: we all have a lot of things we identify with.  
What nationalism is though is taking a specific cultural identity and telling people who feel identified with it ""hey, you should have a state of your own"".   
Problem number one, this ignores all other forms of identity: it's saying this one identity is so important it needs a government and administration for itself where all the others aren't. 

You do have various levels of administration that roughly correspond to other forms of identity. Sevillians have a city council, Andalucians have municipal authorities, Europeans have the EU, etc. These are all various levels of autonomies. Independence, though, is a special kind of autonomy, radically different in many respects to all others and you have to draw the line somewhere. You say there is no logical reason why it should be drawn at the national identity level. Where else then? You could say the same about any other identity. It seems to me like you effectively oppose the idea of a state because, according to your logic, there is no good reason to create it at any level.

&gt; Do you think it's a coincidence that Catalanoia and Euskadi are the richest regions in the country and Galicia and the Canary Islands among the poorest? Hint: it's not. 

Sure it isn't, but it doesn't necessarily imply what you say it does. Ordinary citizens also have motivations for not sharing their income with other, poorer regions.

You do have a good point regarding how national identity has been used by the elites both historically and (to a lesser degree) today, but I think you are overstating it a bit. There are other factors behind the emergence of national identities in the 18th century and there are certainly other major factor behind contemporary separatist movements.

By the way, let's not use the terms ""national identity"" and ""nationalism"" interchangeably. The latter carries much stronger connotations.

true,casio85,SCOT,Scotland,"Ok so I'll try to apply those same things to Scotland and see what you think.

Language- Well we do have people who speak Gaelic in the highlands and island. Some lowland schools teach in it but its not big. Most people in Scotland speak a mixture of Scots and English. They are very similar(as I believe Spanish and Catalan are). It is debated whether Scots is a language or a broad dialect. Probably a dialect in my opinion but I'm just putting it out there.

Culture- There is clearly a distinct Scottish culture. Scottish people will use different references and different words than others in the UK. Of course we have the whole men in kilts with bagpipes eating shortbread part of it as well. Some of this may seem trivial but political culture is without a doubt different. Scotland proves every general election that it is more left leaning than the UK. We are much more opposed to nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, more in favour of the EU, renewable energy, the welfare state and less opposed to immigration compared to the rest of the UK. I don't think it can be denied Scotland has a distinct political identity.

Dictator- not really. I mean if you go back far enough certain aspects of Scottish/Gaelic culture were attacked. Such as the banning of tartan. But none of that seems relevant. However, I will say that you could probably compare how Catalans felt oppressed and treated unfairly by Franco to how Scots felt treated unfairly by Thatcher and other conservative governments. Of course the treatment by Franco is in a whole other ball park and I don't mean to diminish it. I'm just trying to find parallels(maybe even where there are none).

Fiscal issues- I imagine your referring to how the Catalans put more money into the Spanish government than they get back. Scotland, after London and the south east is the most profitable part of the UK and contributes more to the UK treasury than the UK average. This is how our higher public spending is justified. Whether you think Scotland is only this economically strong because of being in the UK or the money spent on each person in the UK should be uniform  is a different matter. The fact remains, Scotland, like Catalonia, is one of the strongest economic regions of their respect countries. 

I think this presents a solid argument of why Scotland independence claim is credible. We have a different nhs, education system and law system also, the backbone of a country. We were a separate country in the past and joined this union as a partner. I think the differing political identities is the major reason for this independence push. It is why I, an undecided voter, am still undecided despite believing many of the economic warnings.

true,ekrst,null,null,"Where did you attend high school? From what I've experienced of German vs. American - the liberal arts aspect is in high school education in Germany. I've met Germans more educated in a well-rounded manner straight out of high school than some Americans with a college degree. If you went to an American school, you could probably benefit from the liberal arts aspect of American colleges. In Germany, you are expected to be well-educated in a general manner before entering university. University is more specialized education. You are also expected to be self-reliant. They do not baby students the way American professors do. 

I think the education is at a higher level in most German universities but there are certain parts of American education which are advantageous, particularly in small schools. For example, the focus on communication (ie writing and presentations) and the opportunities for discussion and sharing ideas. From what I've seen in Berlin and Rome, these are generally less common in European universities.

As far as social aspects, German universities are less structured. It's more like a job - you show up to learn and go home. Students socialize, but without the uni doing much to organize it. Never knew anyone who lived in a dorm in Europe, know nothing about that. Again, in Germany uni is more like adult life - you are there to study, it is like a job, nobody is taking care of other aspects of your life.

For example, in furniture, food packaging, dental restorations, plumbing, pesticides, insulation, supermarket receipts, fracking fluids, plastic bottles, non stick cookware, fabrics, and so on.

Those chemicals are just as dangerous in the US, but many have largely escaped regulation. this has a direct effect on families and peoples health that is completely ignored by the people promoting deregulation. its as if that problem does not exist to them.

Well it seems that you completely misunderstood my argument then.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Finland would have to pay back any investment a company made before the industry was nationalized.

From news and references I understand that the payback isn't the investment, but the expected worth of the investment. This seems logical too, otherwise stuff like health service providers would be put in a real hard spot. After all, most of the equipment isn't exactly expensive: a general practitioner needs a rented room and a computer along with some wooden sticks. Supported housing for elderly isn't much more complicated. And so on. 

County could simply announce that the contract would be terminated at the turn of the year and pay back for few computers. At worst they would have to buy some infrastructure that they need in any case if they are going to continue the operation in any form. 

I don't think this is the case, otherwise some lobby group would have mentioned it in the news already. 

&gt;The Fujitsu GBP700 million judgement for the NHS shows many of these protections already exist.

I'm not familiar with the case. If you are going to use it as your main support, could you give me a link?

&gt;It would have to be acceptable to everyone at the national level to pass, so it can not be too radical.

""Radical"" is under discussion. After all, the pressure for any national operator is immense to accept. Normal peer pressure. Nobody wants to be the guy who's face is plastered in media worldwide with the title ""WRECKER OF MULTIBILLION DEAL"". Particularly if there are people in the home country who would gain from the deal.

&gt;I personally prefer it this way. Given the amount of lobbyists Brussels and Washington have, I am glad they do it behind closed doors then put it to a vote. 

According to TACD, USA shows the drafts to corporate advisors (that is, the biggest American companies). It's only private citizens who are left out.

&gt;I am talking about opposition to the Japanese agreement from the European public.

Why should Europeans be in opposition to what Japanese do? Even if it would concern us, we hardly even get outraged on stuff that directly affects us, not to mention stuff that might have something to do with us a decade down the road. 

And anyway, what could we do? We aren't a negotiating party.

Do all the people that speak Catalonian want their own country or just the people in the province of Catalonia? 

As an American in a super-liberal Western state, I don't feel like I have anything in common with someone who has chosen to live in Florida or South Carolina but I like that we all live together and I can go there, move there, trade there, etc. without any barriers. If Catalonia became a country but stayed in the EU, what would really be the difference apart from A) They wouldn't have to share their wealth with the rest of Spain (I'm looking at you, Andalucia) and B) They could say they have their own country so they'd feel better, I guess.

All seems pretty petty to me. Spain is such a great country because, much like the US, it is a great big grab bag of wonderful people, cultures, climates, attitudes and ideas and that variety and constant disagreement (much like a long-term relationship) is a good thing that it seems is worth the cost to maintain.

If you are a German citizen it means that you can study anywhere in Europe and also receive a grant from the government to help you. Also in most European Universities there is a thing called an [Erasmus programme](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm) which allows you to study at another University in Europe for a year or semester, which is incredibly awesome. My brother went to Italy and I may be going to Germany. You actually get *additional* grants for doing this.

In regards to clubs and sports, I can say that my University has a massive variety of Sport clubs and Societies and there's more every year! If you can think of a club/society then we probably have it. 

I have worked in Germany(Bavaria) in the past and I've had some of the best nights of my life out there. It's by far my favourite country in Europe. The people, food, beer,women and the nature are amazing. I don't know a person who hasn't enjoyed Germany.

I've never been to the US so I really can't compare the two. I don't think this is the exact answer you are looking for but if you have any questions feel free to ask.

The institute then became under controversy when his replacement, Andrei Marga, wanted to promote Romanian culture abroad in the same line that Hungary is doing now: old painters, nationalist tendences, etc. Luckily, the guy didn't last much.

Then you have the tremendous cuts for cultural activities, including several festivals that have [had long tradition](http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutul_Cultural_Rom%C3%A2n#Festivaluri_neeligibile).

With the sole exception of the MNAC in Bucharest (that I can think of), the rest of the cultural spaces sponsored by the state in province devote themselves to old fashion art, and rarely to contemporary, critical works. 

The good news here is that they are a load of organizations all around Romania that have been working with foreign grants and forming public for a while now. They have created networks, festivals (like the ones mentioned above), residencies and fights for recover public spaces. But from the Romanian government, the cultural tendency is rather archaic, IMO.

The decrease in production from nuclear is an order of magnitude away from the increase in fossil fuels. Even if the report was off by several TWh, it seems clear that nuclear power wasn't simply replaced by fossil fuels. Additionally, these numbers don't even take into account that less efficient fossil fuel plants were phased out, and more efficient ones came online, meaning that the increase in electricity production from fossil fuels doesn't even equal an equivalent increase in fossil fuel consumption and CO2 production.

I'm not even arguing that everything here is rainbows and unicorns. There are huge challenges ahead, ranging from efficient storage options to a grid that could efficiently handle extremely distributed production. And the current implementation has its range of problems as well. Production opportunities are, by necessity, unequally distributed between geographic regions as well as between urban and rural populations; all while the feed-in tariffs essentially assume equal production opportunities for every consumer.

But there's this lazy narrative that consistently gets promoted that Germany switched off its nuclear power plants due to a knee-jerk reaction after Fukushima, and now replaced pretty much the entire capacity with fossil fuels - when in reality the phase-out of nuclear power has been decades in the making (albeit with a different timeline up until 2010), and fossil fuels have only replaced a fraction of former nuclear production.",0,1410505346,null,0,false,0,ckg3qfr,t3_2g3z49,t1_ckg3qfr,t1_ckg34ba,null,1427056289,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I think this view represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the creature that is Homo Sapiens. Its ingrained into our DNA to fracture, seek differences, and create the ""smallest, large group possible"" in order to maximize resources. Nothing in our history suggests humans are willing or desire to ""all be in one huge happy group"". Its why the UK is splitting in half despite being incredibly wealthy, successful, and part of the same country for 300 years. The reason being, (to Scots) the size of the group needed to acheive the same amount of wealth can now be reduced to Scotland, rather than needing to be in the large UK.

This isnt a matter of simply needing the right argument to convince everyone. This is evolutionary psychology you are fighting against. It would be like trying to convince everyone in the world to stop having sex permanently. Because when everyone is a group, what is the point. That is why every country that stands unopposed delves into political infighting and civil war (see the USA currently or Rome or any dozen other ""victorious"" empire).

&gt; What staying in the EU does is allow a framework to be created that could potentially, down the line, favour the working class people.

This is a big and important point. The reality, and it is absolutely crucial that we all realise this, is that the working classes of Europe are really one group. There is not an English working class that is separate from the French, or Danish, or Polish working classes. Each of their individual governments will want to keep the illusion that they're separate, because it makes them politically manageable, but at this time in history it has never been more appropriate to revisit the old marxist idea of ""international solidarity"".

I know many readers, especially Central and Eastern Europeans, flinch at the word 'marxist', but we must be able to take seriously the founding analyses of Karl Marx, which still hold true today, without simultaneously presuming the vast and tragic humanitarian catastrophes previous (non-)attempts resulted in.

The dream of the European left is that the European Union would be a platform upon which such an international solidarity could be implemented, but as you say with the election of Juncker and a strongly neoliberal and neoconservative European Parliament, it doesn't really seem around the corner.

The task now must be to show European working classes that the extreme right and the centre-right don't actually have the workers' best interest at heart. They are, and have always been, in the pockets of the existing powerful classes, be that business owners, the financial class, or simply the aristocracy.

Few years ago I was doing some research for an article about migrations to FLOSS (Linux and/or OpenOffice/LibreOffice), and long story short:

- Most on unsuccessful cases failed because municipality didn't allocate any money for it — they suddenly realized they have no money for an upgrade, decided to switch to FLOSS because it's free and *of course* they don't need a cent to migrate, but when it miraculously failed they somehow manage find few millions to buy new computers and proprietary software.
- Cost of training staff and maintenance is comparable. Cost of converting documents is a bit (but not that much) higher in case of migrating to Linux and/or OpenOffice/LibreOffice. Cost of converting/rewriting of in-house software depends on how it's written — web based an multiplatform software (Java &amp; co.) usually require none to only a little work, other may require more work and sometimes it's better to keep Windows on a few computers or use it via thin client when it's needed.
- Low-tech staff isn't really a problem — they always whine a lot, not only when you switch from Windows to Linux, but also from one Windows version to another. It's just what they do.
- Biggest problem for administration unit when migrating to FLOSS isn't money, or staff, but other administration units who didn't migrate. ",0,1410506464,null,0,1410506693,0,ckg40cl,t3_2g5192,t1_ckg40cl,t1_ckfvdrl,null,1427056117,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Le plus dangereux dans le terrorisme, c'est pas la mort. Cinquante personnes qui meurent dans une explosion terroriste, c'est que dalle à l'échelle d'une nation comme la France. C'est bien entendu une tragédie, un drame national. Cinquante citoyens massacrés dans leur propre pays. Il faut des réponses, des coupables; ils faut des mesures. Augmenter la sécurité et la surveillance. Arrêter des suspects. Mais le danger, c'est pas un pignouf dont le cerveau est passé à la machine à laver coranique.

The icing on the cake was when I updated my last Ubuntu installation through the regular update process, and the system wasn't able to reboot anymore after that. Linux is for people who like to understand what is happening and why, but I would never recommend it for people who would just like to use their computer and want things to simply work. Maybe one day it will be, but after 10 years I'm still waiting for a Linux for the average user (excluding Android here).",0,1410507118,null,0,1410514267,0,ckg460z,t3_2g5192,t1_ckg460z,t3_2g5192,null,1427056044,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Unless a system is consistent with all EU member states, then it will simply run into trouble down the line. An inconsistent system serves nobody except the few in the epicentre that are ready to exploit it. 

What the prospect of nations breaking apart is showing is, not a *potential* problem, but an *existing* problem. Even if both Scotland and Catalonia remain part of their respective countries, the need for reform in this regard still remains. 

This is very much why for countries such as Ireland, Catalonia or Scotland the prospect of NATO membership is unattractive. They are willing the join the EU because they will at least have the least bit of voice in overall matters. With NATO on the other hand foreign policy is already set by outside entities. Good if your foreign policy interests are straightforward and align with that of NATO HQ (as is the case with Baltic countries and increasingly Eastern Europe), but not for anyone else. Thus the EU needs to thread well as to not fall into that trap.

Having mentioned that subject, a good reform to clamour for is for European nations to be represented in NATO by the EU and not individually, thu sadapting NATO to the realities of the 21st Century rather than keeping it as it was designed for the 20th. This would simplify matters in a Transatlantic alliance by reducing the moving parts and, more importantly, allowing European security to develop more organically and domestically; in contrast to the current state of affairs where CSDP is put on hold simply because it is seen as mutually exclusive to NATO when, ideally, its product should be a constituent participant of NATO.

stop-working-and-start-making

Ven a probar MOB, te encantará. Confirma que eres un maker durante la semana del 22 al 26 de septiembre. Abriremos la Zona Móvil de 9.30 a 19.30 de lunes a viernes a indecisos, curiosos e inconformistas. 
Aquellos que den el paso y decidan formar parte de nuestra comunidad tendrán un 15% de descuento en octubre en cualquiera de las tarifas.
Durante estos días se organizarán una serie de actividades que reflejan cómo funciona el MOB. El miércoles 24 tendrá lugar un “We hear you”, un foro de intercambio en el que los mobbers asentados y los recién llegados se presentarán y explicarán sus respectivos proyectos. El jueves 25 se celebrará el tradicional  Surprise Sandwich Day, en el que cada uno trae un ingrediente para acompañar el pan con tomate y el vino cortesía del MOB. La semana acabará con una demostración de fabricación digital introducida por Cecilia Tham en el FabCafe y culminará con la Quit your job party, en la que las cervezas correrán a cargo de Estrella Damm. 
MOB es una comunidad de creativos que está en constante interacción. Lugar donde conviven arquitectos, start-ups, desarrolladores web, publicistas, diseñadores, artistas y estudiantes de diversas índoles. Este espacio, diáfano y transversal, es idóneo para la innovación, la colaboración y  está rodeado de algunas de las tecnologías más punteras. Sin ir más lejos el FabCafe, a parte de un bar, es también un laboratorio de fabricación digital, en el que la impresora 3D y la cortadora láser atraen todas miradas.
En un ambiente así no se trabaja, se crea. Por eso, sal de tu rutina, libérate de tu trabajo y conviértete en maker.

As soon as you set foot into MOB you will love it. MOB is offering YOU one week to see what you’ve been missing in the art of making, from the 22nd to the 26th of September. Our Mobile Area will be open and free to the public from 9.30 to 19.30 Monday to Friday for the undecided, curious, and hip.

And, if you decide to become part of our community will have 15% discount in October on any of the memberships.

During our trial week, MOB will be hosting a variety of events and workshops to show-off some of our serious perks and resources. On Wednesday 24th we will host We hear you, a forum to pitch your project and exchange views between newcomers and old MOBbers. On Thursday 25th the traditional Surprise Sandwich Day will take place, a potluck style lunch where everyone brings an ingredient and MOB supplies to bread, tomato, and wine. The week will end with a bang! in a digital manufacturing DEMO introduced by Cecilia Tham in FabCafe culminating with Quit Your Job Party, where beers will be provided by Estrella Damm.

MOB is a community of creative people who are constantly empowering each other. Where architects, start-ups, web developers, publicists, designers, artists and students and so much more. This open, lateral space is tailored to innovative collaboration, all surrounded by the most advanced technologies. Just on the other side of our glass doors FabCafe, more than a coffee shop, is a digital fabrication laboratory, in which the 3D printer and laser cutter attract all eyes.

In an environment where we are constantly creating and redefining, we don’t simply work, we make. MOB invites you to get out of your routine, you have one week to stop working and start making.

Why is it impossible to have everyone represented in a parliament? It really is not. It just requires proper democratic institutions. It requires giving enough seats in the parliament so nations with a mere two million population won't find themselves with just one seat if they all vote for one candidate. It requires to be innovative and work out a better democratic model for the 21st century and set an example for the world to follow.

&gt;Look at Scotland and the UK. You will not find a more homogeneous union of two states in the world, and yet the Scots don't feel that London is capable of catering for the needs of Scotland and the rest of the UK at the same time. They want their own government, not just devolved powers as you describe, but a proper government with full powers within the existing framework of the EU. 

It isn't actually comparable - Scotland alone is dominated by London. If you seek to balance population throughout regions you won't have this problem of a unbalanced power balance. And yes, Denmark alone would be dominated by London as well, but together with the rest of Scandinavia we can challenge them.

&gt;Speaking of which, some member states (the UK being one) are saying they want some powers returned to them from the EU. UKIP - a ridiculous party - is, nonetheless doing well here on just that issue.

Yes because we stand at a middle ground. We can either go forward and survive, go backwards thus stand alone and be taken over or stand still and be partitioned. ",0,1410509599,null,0,false,0,ckg4p5l,t3_2g55d2,t1_ckg4p5l,t1_ckg4jyt,null,1427055678,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I don't know if you're aware of it, but there's also a stong call for self-determination in the Basque Country, and it isn't something new: pro-independence Basque nationalism is as old as the Catalan movement. Pro-autonomous and pro-independence Basque political parties are currently in power in the Basque Government and the Basque Parliament. Galicians also have their own claims for independence, although they're a minority for now. The Cantabrians *used* to have their own language, but not anymore since long ago.

&gt;I know they have their own language and culture but why do you need your own country for that?

Ideally, you shouldn't need your own country or state. But we're talking about Spain here. When your language and culture is historically and continously attacked, when your rights of self-government are continously questioned, and especially when the language of other region (in this case Castilian, aka ""Spanish"") is imposed over your language, continously promoting the disappearence of your language in favour of the other, then you realize that coexistence is impossible. Catalans and Basques know much about that.

A ""verb phrase"" means all the verbs that go together. It's slightly complicated in German because verb phrases are frequently split, like this:

&gt; Ich **habe** den Film gestern schon **gesehen**.

The two verbs are actually part of the same verb phrase, ""habe gesehen"". If you construct a sentence with two verb phrases, you need a comma:

&gt; Nachdem ich den Film **gesehen habe**, *bin* ich nach Hause *gegangen*.

That's two verb phrases, ""habe gesehen"" and ""bin gegangen"", separated by a comma. A typical mistake made by German native speakers is this:

&gt; Nach dem Kinobesuch, *bin* ich nach Hause *gegangen*.

This is what Bastian Sick calls ""das gefühlte Komma""; because in speaking there's a natural pause, the temptation is to put a comma there. But the phrase ""Nach dem Kinobesuch"" doesn't contain a verb phrase, so the comma is actually unnecessary. It should therefore, according to the current formal grammar rules, be:

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"First, let's take a look at what the EU is and where it came from, because it really helps with the understanding of most related issues and it may help to predict where the union is heading.

The EU has its origins in post-WWII Europe. At the time. three major wars between Germany and France were still in living memory. Back then, coal and steel were the two industries necessary for armament, so what French foreign minister Robert Schuman suggested in 1950 was that, if French/German/European industries were 'entangled' (read: dependent on each other), then another large scale European war would become practically impossible, and the European Coal and Steel Community was founded the year after with France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg as its members. Gradually, this economic community expanded to involve other industries and countries, and today we have a Single Market for practically the entire economy.

This Single Market is really at the core of the whole thing. It's important to understand that this goes far beyond a mere free trade area. Not having to pay duties on goods is just a small aspect of it; we have free trade with e.g., South Korea and a customs union with Turkey, but those countries' status is far from the same as that of other countries that are members of the EEA (European Economic Area, that is, the Single Market), which are Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and, more or less, Switzerland.  
In a free trade area, you don't have to pay duties when you import/export goods between members, and typically there are other agreements that simplify trade related bureaucracy. The Single Market is all that, but also harmonizes regulations that affect the economy, and removes all barriers that used to distinguish between domestic companies and those located in other member states (e.g., the breakup of the various former state monopolies on telecommunication). 

One such regulation that you directly benefit from, and that is one of those regulations the UK government would like to negotiate an exception for, is the [Working Time Directive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Time_Directive). If it wasn't for that and related regulations (other worker's rights and safety regulations, environmental regulations, etc.), countries would have to compete in those areas to become more ""attractive"" for companies that were making a decision on where to e.g., build another factory. All other factors being equal, the ""lowest bidder"" would get the investment and jobs, which would result in a race to the bottom.

Another barrier of trade that the EU removes are various regulations on things like product safety or standards, say, what kinds of materials are allowed or what kind of crash tests and emission standards cars need to pass. What this means is that whatever parts your factory produces automatically adheres to the same standards in all of the EU/EEA members, and they can be exported within the EEA without having to go through another certification process in each individual member state -- one certification is enough and will be recognized within the entire Single Market.

It's similar in other areas that affect you as a consumer. I'm sure you've seen the [CE mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking) on various packages or products before. It means that the product conforms to EU standards. Before those product regulations were unified, manufacturers had to go through a certification process in each individual country, and depending on the product it just wasn't worth it. But since, together, we're the single largest market in the world, manufacturers make sure their product conforms to our standards before it even gets built.  
This also means we can have things like the EU's mandatory two-year warranty, the electronic recycling directive, or the bans on animal testing for cosmetic products and on keeping chicken in cages. If individual countries would try to introduce similar regulations on their own, companies might just decide that it's not worth selling their products there, but since we're such an important market as a whole, we can do that and the companies will just have to cope.

Of course, this is a two edged sword. Your company can compete with those in other countries and access their home markets just as if it were the UK (really, what it means is that your company's home market *is* the EU/EEA), and you could move to and take a job elsewhere within the EU, but it works the other way round just as well. What the criticism is really about, though, is sovereignty. If we want the benefits of the Single Market, which in essence are those common regulations on all aspects related to the economy, then we need a mechanism to agree on those regulations, which the British press likes to refer to simply as 'Brussels'.  
Traditionally this decision making process required *all* member countries to reach a unanimous agreement, but lately, more and more decisions are being made by the European Parliament and through a *qualified* majority in the Council (the body where the respective national governments are members of). ""Qualified majority"" means that not *all* countries have to agree, but only a majority that represents both a certain percentage of the EU's population and the number of member states, because finding a compromise between 28 national governments that all have a veto (and may be in election campaign mode) is just impractical and only results in the endless debates and horse trading the EU is so well known and loved for. This trend is likely to continue, and the EU will eventually resemble a federation where decisions in some, especially market related areas, will be made on the federal level whereas those that are better kept on the national level will remain there (""Subsidiary Principle""). Of course, reasonable people may disagree on where the appropriate place for the various areas of competence are, and whether we should have a ""Europe of two speeds"" with a more closely integrated core than the rest, or not, but the trend is there. I'd even argue that it's a necessity if we want to have a say in a multi-polar world and see eye-to-eye with the US, China and others. Whether that's worth accepting that some decisions are being made in Brussels instead of London is a matter of debate, and some people certainly seem to have a problem with this transfer of sovereignty.

In case of a 'Brexit', the UK would have to renegotiate its relationship with the EU, and which party would have the bigger leverage should be obvious. The EU can't accept the UK treating the Single Market like a buffet where it chooses the areas it wants to be a part of and which not à la carte, because that would set a bad precedent and really would unravel the core principle of the EEA, that is, that the same regulations govern the whole of it everywhere (that's the whole point, after all). So, after exiting the EU (the body that decides on the common regulations of the Single Market), the UK could remain in the EEA (i.e., keep access to the Single Market), but that would mean still having to adhere to the regulations without having a say in the decision making process (like e.g., Norway) and would kinda defeat the purpose. Or the UK could leave the EEA, not be subject to regulations from Brussels and regain full sovereignty in all areas, but at the cost of losing direct access to the Single Market.

Regarding your third point, I don't think it's that simple. ""The rich"" aren't a homogeneous group and their interests depend on what kind of business they're in. Companies that serve customers outside the UK typically are very much pro-EU, whether they're in such diverse areas like manufacturing or in finance.  
The EU is a convenient scapegoat, in a sense. ""Brussels made us do it"" is a nice way of justifying unpopular decisions. The EU tends to be invisible when it works well, but very much visible when it doesn't. Playing the national sovereignty card is always popular whether you're rich or poor, and the simple fact is that, at least in the UK, headline about real or perceived scandals in the EU sell paper.

What you're saying is both contradictory and paradoxical.  It is possible that I both understand what I'm saying, and you're just plain wrong.

When I said we would need to lose diversity in order for a central European Government to work, I backed it up with an example. It is not unsupported.  Maybe you should read it again.  Your assertion that it's not a good example doesn't really hold up because it is a REAL example, not some hypothetical dreamed up, and is therefore realistic.

Your version of going forward would be to put all member states in the same position as Scotland and Catalonia, small powerless states with very little voice in what happens to them.  Eventually we might end up with something like the USA, but we're just too diverse for that to happen for a while yet.

&gt;Yes because we stand at a middle ground. We can either go forward and survive, go backwards thus stand alone and be taken over or stand still and be partitioned.

And you talk to me about unsupported assertions?  also this is a particularly glaring false dichotomy.  

There's nothing to suggest we will be taken over, go backwards or otherwise be defeated if we don't follow your blinkered vision of how things should be.  There are other ways to proceed from where we are.

I'll probably receive a lot of hatred for this, but I know a lot of Spanish and Catalans so I've heard both sides' stories waaayy too many times. In general the Catalans like to vastly exaggerate and twist their history (starting in school) by mixing truth with lies so it makes look like they've always been victims. Catalans are also, in general, quite a bunch of hypocrits. They claim they don't feel Spanish, they claim they are Catalans and not Spanish, they bore strangers to death with these stories of how repressed they are, but at the end of the day, guess who are the Catalan expats' best friends? That's right, the Spanish. And guess what? They speak Spanish with them without complaining and they even talk about Spain as their country! And what about football? Oh, that's when things get funny. That's when they stop referring to Catalonia as a country of its own and start saying that what they *really* want is an independent state, as Monaco with France.

Let's be clear that Franco was a fucking disgusting dictator, but it's also true that he made Catalonia rich, which the Catalans always seem to forget about when they argue they would be wealthier and better off without the debted Spain, amongst many other things.

It would be completely fine and acceptable to me if their argument would be that they don't feel Spanish and they don't want to be ruled by the assholes in Madrid, as the Scots argue. That would be consistent, at least.

If you want to be independent under these circumstances, take your goddamn state/country but be prepared to face its consequences.

true,TacticalNukePenguin,UKGB,United Kingdom,"In an **ideal** world, for me, I'd like to see the EU more integrated. I know there are many arguments against it, but I think that a full federal model would make the EU stronger overall. So bring fiscal control into the European Parliament. I'm not sure exactly how I'd go about making the transition from National governments to Federal governments, but that's the direction that I'd like to go. Get to a point where the decisions of one state aren't bringing down all of the other states, and where companies can't get massive trade bonuses in one country because they've got their head office in a country that has different corporate laws.

I think countries like the UK and Denmark should be given the choice to either become full members or leave the union. I'd like for both of them to go all in, but on a domestic level I know there'd be wide spread opposition to that (as I'm sure there would be to my federalisation ideal). Really I'd want an all in union. Federal states that can do their own thing, but a central government (that doesn't necessarily have its fingers in everyone's pies) to give a strong back bone.



**Realistically**, I expect very little to have changed. A few more member states (Bulgaria, Ukraine, etc.), but the UK (or rUK depending on how the referendum goes in Scotland) and Denmark will still stand apart.

I imagine there will be a bit of a shift to the right for quite a lot of member states. Maybe not by much, but a shift, probably in retaliation to continued immigration and to the Middle East, Israel, North Africa, etc. Countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal, I can see them shifting a bit further to the right than countries who aren't still struggling from the recession.

There will still be conflicting objectives for each nation. Germany will still be a power house moving towards green energy. Spain will still be struggling with high unemployment.

If Scotland gets independence from the UK, I imaging there will be bigger pushes from other areas wanting to separate from larger countries....",0,1410511936,null,0,false,0,ckg54yi,t3_2g6o1f,t1_ckg54yi,t3_2g6o1f,null,1427055440,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

Ask some of the other guests about the Hochzeitstisch (some other relatives who are likely to be invited) if you don't want to ask the bridal pair.

but there is a huge misconception that nuclear power is supposed to be bad.


http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2013/09/29/forget-eagle-deaths-wind-turbines-kill-humans/

so basically wind power is less safe than nuclear power, thats pretty much a fact if any.

what else do we have, best form of Electricity... 

well, http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2013/11/07/wind-power-and-nuclear-power/ 

sure Dams might be up there in terms of production, but they are insanely destructive in terms of environment, next up would probably be wave driven generators, which might work but it is quite expensive and you are limited geographically to heavy tide areas

next up... cheapest? 
i cba to find a source but my windpower engineer buddy mentioned a nuclear power plant pay itself off in 2-3 years while a windmill takes 8-9 years to pay itself off, and while a windmill has a lifespan of 12-14 years depending on model (or something like that) a nuclear power plant has a lifespan of 30-40 years, where you can easily upgrade it plenty of times.

sure a dam could be better/cheaper but still dams are poop :o

and on the subject of cleanest, you still need to produce and reprocess a windmill/dam/nuclear power so i guess they would be even on that scale when it comes to cleanest, A gen4 nuclear power plant would only have to store the waste matter for 900~ years, thats pretty clean considering it gets done deep in a mountain shaft where nobody visits anyway. a generation 5-6 might take that waste and reduce it completely.

* The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (the regional equivalent to a constitution), which was approved by the Catalan parliament, approved (with modifications) by the Spanish parliament and also approved by referendum by the Catalan people in 2006; was finally declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. It must be noted that the Constitutional Court of Spain is heavily controlled by the two big Spanish political parties and, to keep their control, they have blocked the due renewal of its members for more than five years. (Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Autonomy_of_Catalonia) )
* The Spanish government has intensively tried to modify the [Mediterranean Freight Rail Corridor project of the European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t-guidelines/corridors/index_en.htm) to pass through the capital Madrid, instead of going along the Mediterranean coast connecting all the seaports there, which is the option defended by the European Commission.

* The last bill to reform the education system in Spain threatens teaching in Catalan in Catalonia, as it has been the norm for the last 30 years. (Source: [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2012/12/language-nationalism) )

After the continued actions of the Spanish government against the interests of Catalonia, it is not very surprising that so many Catalans do not feel to be represented by that government and want to detach themselves from it.

It's cleanest. No pollution, waste is burned in newest reactors. Amount of fuel needed is extremely small and nuclear reactors produce **LESS** radiation than conventional coal power plants. 

It's the safest - the only accidents outside of Russia took natural disasters combined with human mistakes, one of which was placing a reactor in a region prone to natural disasters.

It's the cheapest and most dependable form of energy that can be utilized in every place on earth. There's just no arguing that. Sure, geothermal would be best, but it's already used everywhere it can be. Renewables are great in principle, but they are expensive and resource intensive, on top of being surprisingly damaging to environment and prone to causing accidental deaths.

En reprennant le texte de [Let's Stop Pretending That French Is an Important Language](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116443/new-york-citys-french-dual-language-programs-are-mostly-pointless), ça donne ça:

|A somewhat ~~surprising~~ ~~piece~~ in The New York Times this week ~~reported~~ that the French ~~dual-language~~ ~~program~~ in New York's ~~public~~ school ~~system~~ ""is booming,"" the third- ~~largest~~ such ~~program~~ in the city, after Spanish and Chinese. That commitment is a ~~beautiful~~ thing—for children of Francophone ~~immigrants~~. But for we ~~natives~~, the ~~idea~~ that kids need to pick up French is now ~~antique~~.

Make no mistake: For ~~immigrant~~ kids from anywhere, ~~bilingual education~~ is ~~invaluable~~. But the ~~idea~~ that American-born children need to learn French has become more ~~reflex~~ than ~~action~~, like ~~classical music~~ played at the wedding of people who live to ~~modern~~ pop. French in ~~educated~~ America is now a ~~class marker~~, ~~originating~~ from that ~~distant~~ day when French was Europe’s ~~international language~~. Fewer Europeans spoke English then, which made French ~~actually~~ ~~use~~ful—at least for Americans who could ~~afford international~~ travel. Those same Americans were also still ~~suffering~~ from an ~~inferiority complex~~ to Europe’s ~~“sophistication.”~~

~~Enter~~ the ~~idea~~ that a ~~language~~ that began as a ~~mere peasant dialect~~ of Latin is a ~~language~~ of ~~precision, savoir-faire~~, and ~~romance~~: Molière, Voltaire, Pepe Le Pew. ~~Naturally~~, then, our little ones must even now know some French to ~~qualify~~ as what ~~used~~ to be called ""~~people~~ of ~~quality~~ .""

But the ~~era~~ of Henry James is ~~long past~~ . When I was a teenaged ~~language~~ nerd in the seventies and eighties, it was the tail end of a time when kids of my bent knew French first and foremost, and then likely ~~dabbled~~ in other ~~Romance languages~~, ~~plus~~ some German and maybe a dash of Russian. ~~Grand~~ old pop-~~linguist~~ ~~authors~~ like Mario Pei could write about what they ~~termed~~ the “~~languages~~ of the world” in books where European ~~languages~~ took up a good half of the ~~space~~. 

After all, between the twenties and the ~~Immigration Act~~ of 1965, ~~immigration~~ to America was lower than it had ever been. Betty Draper and Lucy Ricardo likely never knew a Chinese ~~person~~ in any ~~real way~~; to them, ~~immigrants~~ were Italians running ~~restaurants~~. But as Fiddler on the Roof’s Tevye had it, “It’s a ~~new~~ world, Golde.” Somewhere in the nineties, I noticed when teaching ~~linguistics~~ ~~classes~~ that Spanish had overtaken French, and that students were more likely to have studied Japanese, Chinese or Arabic than German or Russian. These are children of the ~~post–Immigration Act era~~, either by birth or ~~just experience~~ . 

What, then, will be a ~~new marker of linguistic classiness~~ ? One could be to seek ~~languages~~ for ~~actual use~~ rather than as a fashion statement—i.e. to be more like Europeans, where English has become the ~~international language~~. One learns French to ~~communicate~~ with … who, exactly? Some will yearn to read Sartre and Molière; more ~~power~~ to them. But what about ~~languages~~ like Spanish and Chinese, which are ~~useful~~ to learn ~~because~~ we ~~encounter~~ them in everyday life? I have seen ~~medical professionals just~~ miss getting plum jobs in New York ~~because~~ a ~~competitor~~ happened to speak Spanish, and Chinese will be increasingly ~~important~~ in the business world. Arabic skills, meanwhile, are achingly needed on the ~~geopolitical scene~~. It’s swell that knowing French allows you to ~~ignore subtitles~~ in the ~~occasional art~~ house ~~film~~, but ~~unclear~~ why this would be ~~considered~~ a ~~priority~~ of childrearing.

And ~~especially~~ with Chinese, beginning to learn the ~~language~~ at 18, in a freshman ~~course~~, is too late. Someone with a few years of Spanish can often ~~communicate~~ on at least the ~~basic~~ level of Chris Farley’s Matt Foley on SNL, but that’s much less likely with Chinese. You have to speak each ~~syllable~~ on one of four ~~tones~~—bi can mean ~~compare~~, nose, than or ~~force~~ ~~depending~~ on the ~~tone~~. That’s easiest for tots with ~~maximally~~ ~~plastic~~ brains and ~~minimal~~ self-~~consciousness~~; later, for many, it is ~~simply impossible~~ . ~~Plus~~ , you have to ~~master~~ a few thousand ~~symbols~~, most of which ~~resemble~~ nothing in ~~particular except~~ one another, in ~~order~~ to even be able to read a ~~newspaper~~ headline or a children’s book. Many ~~adults~~ gamely hoping to learn a little Chinese are ~~defeated~~ by the ~~demands~~ of the ~~characters~~ alone. Kids have more time and less else to ~~focus~~ on, and can learn the ~~symbols~~ more as Chinese kids do. 

What, then, is the ~~benefit~~ of kids ~~internalizing~~ Comment allez-vous? rather than ¿Como estas?, Nǐ hǎo?, or even Hindi’s Ap kaise hai? All I know is that if my two-year-old ~~turns~~ out to be the ~~language~~ nerd I was, I will ~~counsel~~ her to think of French as a ~~distinctly~~ low ~~priority~~ . I’m trying to learn some Chinese ~~lately~~. As I ~~laboriously~~ stuff the ~~characters~~ into my head with flash ~~cards~~ and watch ~~natives~~ sweetly wincing as I mangle the ~~tones~~, I only wish that even as far back as the Watergate ~~era~~ they had been teaching me Chinese instead of the likes of pomme de terre and je m’appelle.

Il piano di rinascita democratica contiene un sacco di punti condivisibili in una società moderna. Che, senza stupirsi, sono applicati in un sacco di paesi e apprezzati anche dagli italiani. 

Non c'è bisogno di fare i complottari e credere che quel gruppo di spostati della p2 abbia avuto *davvero* tutto questo potere.

Ho chiesto già agli admin di scrivere uno *statement* pubblico riguardo la vicenda su /r/italy o almeno di darmi l' autorizzazione a postare le loro risposte. Non mi hanno ancora risposto.

Se /u/louisbeta è stato shadowbannato è perchè a questo punto assumo sia coinvolto nell' operazione.

I understand if you choose not to investigate this, but i thought it was worth a try. Thanks anyway in advance.

&gt; Thank you for the interest.

&gt; This would probably be a good example. Disregarding the question discussed there (which, to give you some context, is one of the topics that the group in question doesn't want to be discussed) i would guess that there is a group of people that downvotes my user and upvotes /u/andreahb 's answers, and that group of people comes from a subreddit called /r/300pd, which they use for coordination during this kind of raid.

&gt; If you want more info from me I am more than available to help you.

&gt; Thanks again!

************

&gt; First of all, thanks again for your interest in this matter.

&gt; I am not sure if you're permitted to share exactly what those ""couple things going on"" you mentioned are - i realize that there might be some issues relative to privacy and generally relative to what is reddit's position regarding to political matters like this one. But, if you are allowed to do so, I would greatly appreciate if you did share them.

&gt; Again, just to give you some context: there are currently several filo-governative influence groups active on the internet, paid directly by political parties parties that are in charge or by institutions politically close to those parties, that have as their purpose the stifling of online debate about actions taken by the italian government. You can find some more information here, unfortunately in Italian only (although I can translate for you if you wish so). They have been really good at hiding their actions up to now, so the informations available on the internet about them are scarce.

&gt; They are active on various forums in Italy (libero.it is being most prominent) and on almost all of the major newspapers' websites. They have been publicly exposed already in some cases. The mainstream media has just avoided the issue.

&gt; My idea is that they are active on reddit too, especially on /r/italy.

&gt; I am a software developer, and I am working and living in Oslo, Norway. When I still was in Italy, I have been working with some social media agencies and (as the economical situation is generally bad in Italy) have lately been struggling to stay afloat. I know, thanks to personal connections I still have with employees still working there, that at least two have now started working directly for the government with the sole purpose of stifling counterinformation online.

&gt; Personally, as much as my life in Norway has been awesome, there is no denying that I was basically forced to leave my country. Because of that, it is very sad for me to witness all of this. That is the reason why I kept ""fighting the trolls"" and that's the reason why I am wrote to you about the situation.

&gt; For those reasons stated, I would really appreciate if you could share, with me or even better publicly on /r/italy, what is exactly going on on the subreddit. It is not about me personally of course (I am using a throwaway account and I will delete it when this matter is over, for the better or worse), it is about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly (online, if there's any such thing :) )

&gt; Again, thanks a lot for your involvment no matter what happens next.

****************

&gt; Hi! Sorry to write you again. I wrote you yesterday too, and I write you again now to ask you if you could give me a very short explanation about what was going on in /r/italy that you ""took care of"".

&gt; Thanks again, if you will not reply to this one I'll take it as a no and won't bother you again.

****************

&gt; Hi! Thanks again for your reply.

&gt; I am not sure if that was clear or not in my last message, but what I was asking you was not details on how this happens, but a statement about what happened and, if that's not possible for you to share, at least a statement about the fact that something happened.

&gt; The discussion is in italian, so even with google translate I guess that would be hard for you to follow (but again, I can translate for you if needed), but if you take for example this thread there are tens of people openly mocking and downvoting everyone that is hinting at the fact that there's a group of people controlling the political discussion there.

&gt; So, a public statement from you or from one of the mods about the fact that yes, something is/was happening and that you took precautions against it happening again would be extremely helpful to the discussion there, which again is monopolized by that group of around 50 people in /r/300pd.

&gt; That is what I was asking for. Sorry if I wasn't very clear.

true,ultimomono,null,null,"Hi there--
I'm a hiking fanatic based in Madrid and have hiked all over the country. Spain is a hiker's paradise. I can't think of region where you can't do a beautiful, isolated hike. 

One thing: there's no one ""Camino de Santiago""--there are many caminos that fan out across Spain. One of the most beautiful is the ""ruta primitiva"" that goes through the interior of Asturias--a very remote area. Spain also has a network of GR (Gran Recorrido) trails that crisscross the country and are well marked. Then there are the vías pecuarias (livestock paths) that also go great distances.

Most of the Spanish countryside is empty. So very, very empty. Even 40 minutes outside of Madrid, once we get away from the easy-access spots, we rarely cross paths with other hikers or bikers. Yesterday I took the light rail to the end of the line, walked 15 minutes past the end of the 'burbs and didn't see a soul for three hours.

To narrow things down, you should decide what else you want to do or see and then look for hikes nearby. Two beautiful coastal hikes I did this summer, that I would highly recommend: the Cap de Creus circuit on the Costa Brava in Cataluña and the Ruta del Flysch from Zumaia to Deba in the Pais Vasco--both just spectacular and not particularly difficult.  

Just a word of caution--I'd recommend avoiding mountain hikes above 2000 meters if you aren't already used to doing them. The conditions in Spain can get harsh very quickly up there and you are usually far, far from anyone who can help if you make a mistake.",0,1410515372,null,0,1410521884,0,ckg5prd,t3_2g5lfc,t1_ckg5prd,t3_2g5lfc,null,1427055026,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

I don't know if you are able to drop everything and study full time. If you can I would suggest doing a 1 year GCSE course where you can get several GCSEs at the end. The next year I would suggest doing an Access course in a topic that you like, the course is only a year. These courses will be intensive and you will need a lot of time to study. Once you do that you are qualified to go to University.

One of my friends however has to work full time to afford the bills. He wants to get into IT. So at the moment he's studying for an IT certificate on his time off. Once he gets that he will be qualified to work in tech support. Once he has his foot in the door he plans on studying for more IT certificates and working his way up. From what I have heard it's a very though career choice since there will be a lot of competitors who are better qualified and with more experience. However IT is an industry where experience and ability counts over all. The hardest part will be getting the first job. After that its up to you.

The most important thing however is losing the attitude you have regarding Maths. Saying ""Maths is Not a strong point"" means you already failed mentally before you started. The vast majority of people learn to dislike Maths at school. I hated it and I thought I was an idiot. The problem was that I couldn't keep up at class and consequently I avoided it which only made the situation worse. It was only years later when I decided to learn at my own pace that I discovered it wasn't that hard. You just have to do a little bit at a time and make sure you understand the concepts fully before moving to the next topic. I've seen people struggle with multiplications and a year later they were doing Calculus as if it was easy like breathing.

Interesting how Russian enemies are invariably nazi-linked in Russian influenced media...

You don't even seem to acknowledge you don't have a foot to stand on even though he just called out you on grounds of hypocrisy - using a flag yourself that was itself a collaborator's flag? another example:

I get your idea, these guys are ethnic Russians, but they are also ""Latvians"" in the sense that (two of them) are Latvian citizens and all three are probably born in Latvia. If people keep this mindset, of people from a different ethnic group not being able to ""belong"" to the country or be ""real Latvians"", then there will always be alienation strong enough to draw young people to these kinds of ""adventures"", especially since Russia is actively trying to attract them to its ideology of a ""Russian world"" and all other such bullshit.

To an extent, I think this is a big failure of the Ukrainian national project over the last 20 years - Ukrainian nationalists, instead of trying to consolidate the nation on the basis of shared political values such as freedom of speech, transparent government, and so on, tried to consolidate the nation on the basis of the Ukrainian language primarily.

Now, I can understand that, since Latvia also has a similar approach - Latvian identity being tied primarily to speaking the language - but there are a couple of problems with it. First of all, when you have such a large amount of Russian-speakers as there are in both countries, they're already in their own self-sufficient world and will resist having another language forced (in their view) upon them. Second, a *sovok* remains a *sovok*, and will continue to espouse digusting, anti-democratic, ""Putin za best"" views in fluent Latvian or Ukrainian.

Of course, these people who have already been sucked into this neo-fascist idea of the ""Russian world"" and are working towards realizing it - they should be repressed.

The second the conversation start it is just a monologue of pre made statements pull from some kind of pro independence manual that someone must have failed to mail me, and within the first minute you will be called ""fascist"" no matter your stance on the matter, for them there is only 2 shades, either you are pro independence or you are a fascist.

For many people, independence have stopped being a mean to obtain an end and the independence has become the end on itself with little to no plan besides it. Yeah there is always the vague ""We'll be better off alone"" and the ""They will stop stealing our money"" (as if the local govern haven't ever stolen anything). On the topic of corruption, I've seen people justify Jordi Pujol on the grounds that, yep, the central goverment is corrupt too!! Welp, fuck the central goverment, the day we are independent they might aswell shit gold turds, our independence its going to be tailored by the stoling corrupt incompetent fuckers that are ALREADY on our goverment and instead of demanding them to come out clean, people its apologizing them in the name of the future nation we are going to be. HOW THE FUCK IS THAT OK?

And also, we want to be in the UE, because that's what Mas has said, well fucktard, how on earth are we going to make it to the UE if Spain can veto us? Greece its been veting Macedonia for quite a while because they don't like the name, what do you think it'll happen if we break up in bad terms with them? And the currency, the euro? seriously? What could possibly go wrong? How are we going to secure our right to print Euros?

Not to speak about the need for an army, border security, etc etc, I reckon these things are far easier to acomplish since as soon as we get recognized by any major country we can purchase weapons from them, but guess how much its talk about this stuff? Nothing nothing at all.

But hey, we OF COURSE want to keep playing in Spain's liga, because somehow, F.C Barcelona playing Espanyol over and over for a whole year gets somewhat tiring. And Football, THATS important.

And for the love of christ, stop painting the independentist movement as leftist, I don't know about Scotland, but here in Catalunya most people vote rather right wing parties or moderate. And hell, those village people are the most Xenophobic bunch I've crossed my path on, independentists on Barcelona are slightly more open minded, but hell meet someone from Tarrasa or whatever other village, whoever is foreign its the devil itself. Its always those fucking Spanish fascists or those fucking German nazis when its not those fuckwards imperialist americans. For the average villager, there is nothing to blame on ourselves, its always the outside to blame, because we are Catalanes, and we are flawless and just plain better than the rest.

My best wish at the moment its that whenever something happens, the UK is still on the UE or that the USA fixes their migration rules, because the day independence comes its going to be the biggest fuck ever, for as much as the current politicians know to manage the pursue of independence, they are going to be lost whenever we ever achieve it. Luckily Mas wants a referendum as much as Rajoy wants it, which is nothing at all, so its going to be status quo for a while longer.

So well rant over, hopefully people start planning for the eventual real independence sometime soon, because it would be nice to have a plan well before we go on our own.",0,1410516375,null,0,false,0,ckg5vru,t3_2g55d2,t1_ckg5vru,t3_2g55d2,null,1427054948,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

Das soll schlußendlich auch der Integration helfen. Ich favorisiere demgegenüber Wahlfreiheit: Jeder soll entscheiden dürfen, wie er das Geld, was der Staat bereit ist in die Hand zu nehmen, einsetzen will. Das hat den - da stimme ich dir zu - unangenehmen Nebeneffekt, daß die, wie du sie nennst, Bildungsfernen, ihre Kinder nicht in den Kindergarten geben, sondern lieber das Geld einstecken. Das ist nun einerseits eine Frage der Prioritäten und andererseits muß man sich anschauen, wie das nun in der Realität aussieht. Wenn es tatsächlich zu viele Leute sind, die ihre Kinder nicht nicht ausreichend vorschulisch fördern, dann sollte es aber keine Herdprämie geben, weil es keinen Kindergarten mehr gibt, sondern eine verpflichtende Vorschule. Wobei man sich dann neben der Eingriffsintensität auchüber (verpflichtende) Ganztagsbetreuung etc. streiten könnte. Da wird es schwer auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu kommen, aber ich hoffe es ist klar geworden, wo die ideologische Bruchstelle zwischen mir und der ""die Linke"" (aber nicht nur der) verläuft? 

Und was Steuern angeht, muß man auch den Tatsachen ins Agge sehen: wir haben freie Wohnsitzwahl innerhalb der EU, d.h. die Superreichen kriegst du nicht. Du kannst es auch niemandem verwehren sein Geld in der Schweiz zu parken. Wir haben demgegenüber eine relativ kleine Minderheit, welche den Großteil der Einkommenssteuerlast trägt. Wo du nun mehr Einkommenssteuereinnahmen herzaubern willst, ohne umzudefinieren, wer reich ist, oder die Steuern doch zu erhöhen, frage ich mich allen Ernstes. Aber hoffentlich können wir uns darauf einigen, daß der Staat wenn nicht sparen, dann doch besser haushalten sollte?

Und zur Privatisierung habe ich kein Wort verloren, wie du darauf kommst ist mir ein Rätsel.

&gt; 
&gt; Woran machst du das fest? Das bedeutet, dass 50% aller Bürger kein Interesse haben, am politischen Prozess teilzuhaben, obwohl sie könnten. 

Wozu auch?  Wozu ohnehin knappe Freizeit opfern für die unbezahlte, dröge Arbeit, eine politische Entscheidung zu finden, die einem wenig bis keinen Nutzen bringt?  Nicht jeder ist so gestrickt, dass ihm die bloße intellektuelle Auseinandersetzung mit der Thematik als Lohn ausreicht.  Dass Du hier offenbar allen Ernstes die Erwartung hast, dass so gut wie alle sich das ungeachtet der übrigen Lebensverpflichtungen wie Kinder- und Altenpflege aufbürden, zeugt entweder von jugendlich-idealistischer Naivetät oder von einem Mangel an Empathie: nicht jeder hat wie Du den Luxus, sich von Berufs wegen mit politischen Themen zu beschäftigen.  Vor diesem Hintergrund ist ein gefühlter Wert von 50± Prozent exzellent.

&gt; Meinst du jetzt Diskussionen innerhalb der Parlamente? Die können tatsächlich von der Qualität her besser sein. Wenn ich mir so eine Diskussion im Bundestag ansehe, ist das schon recht ... ernüchternd. Da kann die Opposition gute Argumente bringen, die Minister spielen lieber mit dem Ipad. (In der Schule würde ich das Teil direkt einziehen, he. ;)) Aber in der breiten Bevölkerung ist die Entscheidungsfindung wirklich nicht anders: Da gibt es den Blick, ist genau wie die Bild. Und die breite Masse lässt sich genau so beeinflussen wie in Deutschland auch.

Man kann die Qualität der Diskussionen innerhalb der Parlamente nicht von der Qualität der Diskussionen außerhalb ihrer trennen, denn erstere ist eine Funktion letzterer.  Repräsentanten des Volkes repräsentieren das Volk eben nicht nur politisch sondern auch ontologisch, und wenn das Volk vornehmlich aus mentalen Lederwesten besteht, dann wird sich im Parlament sicher nicht die Crème de la crème finden, und genau darauf will ich hinaus.  Indem Du also bekundest, dass Dir der Qualitätsunterschied zwischen den Parlamentsdebatten in Deutschland und der Schweiz auffällt, dann konzedierst Du im Grunde, dass ich Recht habe.  Es mag sein, dass »Blick« der deutschen »BILD« entspricht, aber worauf es ankommt, ist der Niveauunterschied zwischen bürgerlicher Presse in Deutschland und der Schweiz, und ich bin mir sicher, dass man, wenn man hier mit der Lupe zu suchen begänne, einen glasklaren Unterschied zugunsten der Schweiz in Dingen wie Anspruch an den Leser und Thematisierungstiefe erkennen würde.

Ich habe ferner den Eindruck, dass es in der Schweiz nicht das Problem gibt, dass Politiker nicht offen reden können, ohne Abstrafung durch den Wähler fürchten zu müssen (wie Horst Köhler damals bei seinem Rücktritt).  Hier besteht ein tiefer Graben zwischen Politikern und Volk, und die Politiker müssen ihn wohl oder übel überbrücken mittels Lüge und einlullender Sprache. Und dieser Graben zwischen Politikern und Volk, der in Deutschland seit Jahrzehnten besteht und meines Erachtens eine Remanenz der von Reaktionären und Nationalsozialisten der Weimarer Republik geschürten Parlamentarismusfeindlichkeit ist, macht Politik in Deutschland zu einer Zumutung und zu einem absolut unappetitlichen Geschäft.  In der Schweiz gibt es das meinem Empfinden nach so nicht.  Ich frage mich, ob sich das sprachlich in den Wahlprogrammen widerspiegelt.",0,1410517484,null,0,false,0,ckg62tu,t3_2g6hra,t1_ckg62tu,t1_ckg5lq6,null,1427054858,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

The thing is, PNV is going on a similar path as CiU went. They don't want to lose votes, yet they know they are losing the younger generations, whom in case of being pro-independence will vote for Bildu instead of them. So, they are starting to radicalize their message. Just in the last elections they proposed to renegotiate the political status of the Basque Country within Spain, and even set up a deadline: 2016. They would not have done anything to mess with the status quo if it wasn't because they fear losing the political majority in the Basque Country (already a lost case in Navarre) to Bildu.

They're not completely wrong about all that but they don't really know the darnest thing about modern French life and politics. 

I mean, honestly, that can be said about American's perspectives on most European countries. Either they can't find it on a map or they have an outdated vision of it left over from their high school European history last. I guess that's why you always hear references to Nazis if Germany is brought up, the fact that French are pussies when it comes to war, or reference the fact that they have a family heritage from X country-- because they have no other reference to refer to. I guess it's hard to acquire full exposure to a European country's modern zeitgeist, trends, culture, etc. unless you visit, but only 1/3 of Americans even have passports.

So in this case, it is not accepting the memes of the right, it is rather redefining the symbolism as less nationalistic and more civic. The fact that some of the right wing also uses it, does not make it their property.

&gt;The __Beretta 92__ (also __Beretta 96__ and __Beretta 98__) is a series of [semi-automatic pistols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_pistol) designed and manufactured by [Beretta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta) of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). The model 92 was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today. The [United States Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) replaced the [Model 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_1911)A1 [.45 ACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.45_ACP) pistol in 1985 with the military spec Beretta 92F, the [M9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_M9).

&gt;Although only 5,000 copies of the original design were manufactured from 1975 to 1976, the design is currently produced in four different configurations (FS, G, D and DS) and four [calibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber):

That's never going to happen. The problem with creating a program is to specify precisely what you want to happen, and natural language is very poor at this task. It is much easier for a person to learn a programming language than to learn how to formulate an English instruction so precisely that a computer will not misinterpret the instruction. The problem is not that the computer can't understand, the problem is that the human can't speak. Another human trying to execute English instructions would run into the same ambiguity problems. Advancement in this area will only come in the form of better programming languages.

On the topic of automation: As the prostitutes are sometimes called the first profession, I jokingly refer to us as the last. The last person to ever work will be a programmer. His job will be to program the first robot that can design and build a better robot. The might be some leftover clerical duties, due to inefficient social organization, but actually necessary work will end once this happens.

No, of course not. They definitely should learn Latvian, because Latvian is the national language and there's no discussion about that, *however* what I'm saying is that it is difficult if not impossible to create a positive national identity on the basis of a shared language alone. Nor is having the attitude that ethnic-Russian Latvians aren't ""real Latvians"" going to help. For that matter, /u/gonios is mistaken when he says that no Latvian can have a connection to pro-Russian rebels - that's not true. There are a few ethnic Latvians that I know of who are simply very old-school sovoks, who have decided that affinity with Russia and its Soviet past is the life for them, and accordingly at least vocally support the rebels in East Ukraine. Anecdotal evidence of Afghan veterans and former (ethnic Latvian) Red Army men supporting ""the right to self-determination of Novorossiya"" and Putin's ""strong hand"" also suggests that there are ethnic Latvians who are anti-democratic and have a Soviet way of thinking.

Even now, we have ethnic-Russian youth being ""hurrah-patriots"" for Putin's Russia... and speaking, expressing their thoughts in perfect Latvian. I would be surprised if there aren't similar people in Estonia - ethnic Russians who have grown up with and learned Estonian to a very high level, but who are anyway infected by the idea of a greater ""Russian world"", etc.

Sowas nennt man im allgemeinen Politikverdrossenheit. Übrigens kann man in manchen Kantonen sogar Online abstimmen. Das dauert 5 Minuten. Jeder bekommt auch Unterlagen zur Briefwahl. Und glaub mir, praktisch niemand setzt sich so intensiv mit diesen Themen auseinander. Die meisten lesen vielleicht noch den Prospekt, den es dazu gibt. Das sind ca 12 leicht verständliche Seiten zu jeder Abstimmung, Pro und Contra und die Empfehlung des Bundesrates ( = der Regierung). Viele stimmen auch einfach aus Bauchgefühl heraus ab. Das hat nichts mit meiner ""mangelnden Empathie"" zu tun oder Naivität (danke für die Beleidigung btw, das ist echt nicht nötig), sondern damit, dass eine demokratische Entscheidung auch ein Mindestmass an Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung haben muss. Das sag ich jetzt nicht aus irgendeinem akademischen Elfenbeinturm heraus. Abstinenz in der Politik bedeutet irgendwo auch eine Abstinenz in der Gesellschaft. Wir reden hier auch nicht von etwas, was sich öffentlich ereignet, sondern höchstens alle 3 Monate. 

&gt;[Demokratische Gesellschaften sind auf eine Beteiligung breiter Bevölkerungskreise angewiesen, sei es auf der konkreten Ebene politischer Aushandlungsprozesse, im Rahmen von Interessenverbindungen oder im engeren Lebensumfeld, beispielsweise bei der Mitsprache in Quartiervereinen oder auch innerhalb der eigenen Familie. Sonst werden gesellschaftspolitische Lebensgemeinschaften und Kulturen zu hierarchischen Gebilden, gesteuert von den Interessen einiger weniger. In der Schweiz wie in anderen westlichen Staaten besteht aber eine Tendenz zur gesellschaftspolitischen Abstinenz und damit zur Gefährdung von Demokratien.](http://www.politischebildung.ch/grundlagen/gegenstand/politische-bildung/?details=1&amp;cHash=c30579d6a20ee8b98e9f708375b5a677) 

.

&gt;einen glasklaren Unterschied zugunsten der Schweiz in Dingen wie Anspruch an den Leser und Thematisierungstiefe erkennen würde.

Den Eindruck habe ich nicht. Ich glaube aber, das ist auch persönliche Präferenz. Auf die schnelle fallen mir auch nur zwei Schweizer Zeitungen/Zeitschriften ein, denen ich eine gewisse Bekanntheit im deutschen Raum nicht absprechen kann: Das eine ist die NZZ, das andere ist die Weltwoche. Erstere ist eher liberal geprägt, letztere verfolgt ganz klar eine (rechte) politische Linie. Da ist das Angebot in Deutschland schon pluralistischer aufgestellt. Aber: haben die ""intelektuelleren"" oder anspruchsvolleren Zeitungen mehr Einfluss als die Bild/Blick? Ich denke mal eher nicht. Vielleicht beim gebildeten Publikum. Bild wirbt ja nicht umsonst damit, die meistgelesenste Zeitung (darf die sich noch so nennen?) in Deutschland zu sein. 

&gt; Und dieser Graben zwischen Politikern und Volk

Naja, das Volk ist ja qua definition immer der Wähler und will es wohl auch so. Der Unterschied dürfte wohl eher darin liegen, dass Politiker in der Schweiz keine Berufspolitiker sind sondern das quasi ""nebenbei"" machen. Finde ich auch nicht so positiv, denn dadurch ergibt sich eine Scheinlegitimation von Politikern, die ""Hauptberuflich"" im Aufsichtsrat von Bank xyz oder Nestlé oder... sitzen.",0,1410520275,null,0,false,0,ckg6lo9,t3_2g6hra,t1_ckg6lo9,t1_ckg62tu,null,1427054424,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

That started in the 1800s with protectionist policies that pretty much forced Spaniards to buy Catalan goods over British imports and it didn't stop with Franco. They also like to go back to the Middle Ages, before the inception of the nation-state, when kings were less powerful and every little institution and every little corner had their ancient privileges. In my opinion, that had nothing to do with national identities and more to do with weaker kings that needed to constantly bargain with everyone for support, money, men, etc. Those ancient laws started to disappear since the 15th Century (see [what happened](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Los_Comuneros_de_Castilla_en_el_Pat%C3%ADbulo.jpg) to the Castilians that wanted the King to respect their old laws and institutions).

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;What you're saying is both contradictory and paradoxical. It is possible that I both understand what I'm saying, and you're just plain wrong.

It really is not. You don't seem to understand the meaning of those words at all if you think so.

&gt;When I said we would need to lose diversity in order for a central European Government to work, I backed it up with an example. It is not unsupported. Maybe you should read it again. Your assertion that it's not a good example doesn't really hold up because it is a REAL example, not some hypothetical dreamed up, and is therefore realistic.

Your example doesn't relate. It is irrelevant. I already told you that.

&gt;Your version of going forward would be to put all member states in the same position as Scotland and Catalonia, small powerless states with very little voice in what happens to them. Eventually we might end up with something like the USA, but we're just too diverse for that to happen for a while yet.

No. There is a very big difference to what I wish to do to Europe and to the Catalonia/Scotland situation. I wish to balance Europe out so no one area gets a completely overwhelming upper hand. That is where your example falls to the ground.

&gt;And you talk to me about unsupported assertions? also this is a particularly glaring false dichotomy. 

It's not a false dichotomy. It presents the options Europe has in its fullest - more integration, less integration or to stand still. We have plenty of examples from history of what happens when a tiny country or person block the entire thing with veto. They get partitioned. We also have plenty of examples of what happens when nations decide isolation is better when great powers roam the Earth: They get conquered one way or another. The preferable option is thus to create a state of our own, capable of wrestling with the problems we will and already face in the 21st century.

&gt;There's nothing to suggest we will be taken over, go backwards or otherwise be defeated if we don't follow your blinkered vision of how things should be. 

Oh no, nothing at all. It's not like we have an expansionist China looming, with their upper class buying up land all over the world. It's not like we have gained a plutocracy in the US in the last ten years. It's not like we have a warmongering Russia waging war on our borders. It's not like we have free trade agreements that intend to put corporations on the level of nations. Nothing like that at all. Everything is sunshine and unicorns.

&gt;Interesting chat though. Over and out.

&gt; The estimated cost of the fuel is projected to be between US$3.00 and $6.00 per gallon (US$0.79 - $1.58 per liter) and that may be something of a problem because the current price of jet fuel is about $3.30 per gallon ($0.87 per liter), which makes the NRL product potentially almost twice as expensive.

There is a lot that is technically possible but economically infeasible and that's what matters in the end. So you need to develop methods to make it more efficient, but there is still a theoretical upper bound to how efficient it can become. This requires research which requires money which nobody wants to spend when you can just drill holes. Or you need drastically cheaper power available to reduce the cost of producing fuel this way. 

You can even make fuel out of sun light (energy) and air (Mostly water vapor, CO2 etc), but with horrible efficiency.

true,Auditor-Of-Reality,null,null,"Depending on what you mean by ""nice"", I think that the salary should not be an issue. Together with physics, computer science and chemistry, graduates in mathematics are among the highest entry salaries after the graduation. In academia or research in general, you are paid less, but the main problem here is that you will most likely be only employed for a limited period of time (2-3 years) after which you will have to find a new job, so moving to a new city every 2-3 years, not the best conditions to have a family for example.

Maybe you could elaborate a bit what you mean by a job in engineering? For example, I know some people who work at Bosch or Siemens, and who develop mathematical models for new complex pieces of metal hardware or production robots. Essentially, they model how certain parts will behave in different conditions and so on. This is all built on complex numerical modelling and requires good computer programmin skills as well as knowledge about numerical modelling. Then I also know people who work in a chemical engineering context where they essentially develop and model the behavior of the stuff that reacts in certain conditions, and by optimizing the conditions they try to optimize the outcome off whatever happens in the reaction.

In general there are some ""Jobmessen"" (job fairs) all over Germany, where companies present themselves to university students and explain who they need and what they offer. Visiting one of those might be interesting for you. I attended one near Stuttgart some years ago which was also centered around engineering and  computer science, but I cant remember the name of it.

Completely reformed. I'd like to see a federalized EU that is an extremely limited minarchist state; where it's only function is to maintain and manage armed forces and defense policy, protect citizens from infringement of their human rights by nation states, to negotiate single market trade agreements with external nations, and to represent the EU on the international stage.

1. An executive that is democratically elected, via the popular vote. One commissioner per nation state like it is now, but elected by popular vote. Yes, this would make commissioners biased for their own nation states as they would be answerable to the electorate, just like most national executives/cabinet members are still answerable to their local electorate. The president is elected in a separate European wide election, not appointed by parliament.
2. A parliament that has the ability to propose legislation, but due to the limits mentioned above this legislation can only refer to human rights, defense policy, ascension of new states, and single market regulations (Personally this is still shit, but is a necessity for a single market).
3. In the case of deploying armed forces internationally, executive must seek parliaments approval in all cases unless retaliatory. No exceptions. Executive has full control over military for defensive actions, retaliation and in the case of non retaliatory international deployment (i.e. versus ISIS) only when power granted by parliament. Each member state must contribute 2% GDP to this federal army (lol this would be so unpopular).
4. The only power the EU parliament has over national spending is setting limits on borrowing. Taxes are still national.
5. The court of justice is similar to the US Supreme court. Presidents make new appointments. They ensure parliament does not try to pass laws outside of its mandate and ensure presidents do not steal power from the parliament.

Rights enshrined in founding documents, including the freedom of the press, freedom of movement, limits on laws imposable from the EU. Presidents and members have limited terms.

The EU can not stop national governments from seeking additional trade agreements on a national level with other nations outside the EU. They can not dictate national tax policy or spending.

Three main elections,

- For election of MEPs, done exactly as it is now.
- For election of President, European wide popular vote.
- For election of cabinet members, popular vote in each member state. This occurs after a presidential election. President elect would be involved in the campaigning for the cabinet members.

As these would be elections additional to nation elections, this might be too many. Would need to be sufficiently spaced out.

*Realistically*:

We will continue to become more federal but with the current democratic deficit. In the future this will lead to extreme internal strife possibly ruining the entire institution.

true,Fuku22us33hima,FINL,Finland,"&gt;In the meantime, the EU, led by Germany, has to deal with Russia and Ukraine. When it comes to developing a long-term EU strategy toward Europe’s East, Merkel will need much support from Poland and France to make the region stable and democratic. As for Putin’s Russia, whatever the outcome of the Ukraine crisis, Moscow has turned away from the West for the moment. That makes the future of Eastern Europe more urgent than ever.

The last chapter.

This is a step to the right direction. IMO east-Europe can and should act like they need to: as NATO members start to react and show unity. And drag Finland into that actions. Finland would need strong support when they are going to apply full membership. Now it looks ""not so good"" as some politicians are opposing stronger sanctions, but that's an economical response. Not that we are militarily scared but that a sudden NATO membership could lead to major economical disaster and that's what we need to handle first. I understand that but I hate how our leadership has managed to make us look like Putins puppets, the Russian media is writing utter propaganda about how Finland is ""with their side"" etc. when the truth is not that. That's also a part of their strategy: to divide EU. 

The Germany is still so beaten and humiliated from the WW2, they hear the Hitler jokes and Israel keeps up the Holocaust everyday so that they are seriously paralysed to touch ""anti-Russian"" talks or discuss about military involvement. I think it's time to stop humiliating Germany and forgive their sins. After all it was over 70 years ago. But meanwhile, lets ie. UK take military lead or Poland or NATO. It is defence what we are talking about. Let Germany handle other aspects like economy. Europe needs now team work more than ever. 

Do we really let an country with an economy size of Italy to bully us with gas? Do we really believe that the same country with population slightly bigger than Poland and Ukraine together to threat us with expansionism? yes, That's Russia I'm talking about.

- Clarity in thinking and vision, simple and efficient structure. Currently EU seems to me as a complicated mess of various institutions. The line between EU and local government competence seems messy and blurry too.
- E-government as a top priority.
- For example, every public transit provider should be legally obligated to publish timetable data in a standardized format. That would allow to build pan-European public transit journey planners.
- Another example, it should be possible to found a company online through your web browser, within 1 hour.
- European electronic id card as a replacement for current id cards.
- It should be as easy for companies to expand and operate in other EU countries as in the US. Currently, you have to hire a lawyer, create a subsidiary, etc.
- In the more distant future, I wouldn't mind merging with Russia's union. China and India have a combined 2 billion population and fast economic growth, they could become quite geopolitically powerful.

Non è così, non è vero, basta una veloce occhiata alla sua post history (quando era disponibile), per vedere come sistematicamente faceva deragliare la conversazione, finendo poi ad accusare tutti quelli che non erano d'accordo con lui, di far parte della grande cospirazione.

per quanto riguarda l'intervento degli admin, la cosa mi è difficilmente comprensibile.

Oppure che il nostro amico abbia omesso una parte della conversazione con gli admin.

I love how this completely fails to address anything I said. I didn't deny that there are pros of nuclear energy, I simply denied that it is the best option because of the cons.

&gt; Newest plants are able to reuse the great majority of the waste from the others, and the rest is disposed in a safe way, underground.

The great majority =/= 100%. Nuclear energy is definitionally not renewable.

There's no such thing as safe disposal of nuclear waste with our current technology. People used to think the same thing about dumping garbage in the ocean, because they thought the ocean was so big there's no way it could cause any harm. That was, until they found sea lions and turtles choked to death on plastic rings and plastic bottle started washing up on beaches thousands of miles away.

Simply putting something underground is not gonna solve anything. Containers break. The waste WILL leak. The question never was, whether they will leak, the question was always *when* they will leak. I'm not kidding. Every defense of nuclear energy on this subject I've ever read always deals with people saying, ""Oh, don't worry, they won't leak for another X number of years."" In essence, you are passing on the burden of dealing with the waste to the people or animals that live X years from now. That's not just, and that's what got us into this mess in the first place: because past generations thought that using up the Earth's resources and polluting it was okay, simply because someone else would have to deal with the problem.

&gt;(there is no problem with that, the Earth's internal heat comes from radioactivity after all)

This is so fucking disingenuous. It's an outright lie, really- and the fact that pro-nuclear folks have to resort to just outright bullshittery tells you everything you need to know about nuclear energy.

The radioactive energy of the Earth comes from very deep within, where it has no chance of harming life on the surface. Where we bury waste is within the Earth's crust, because we have yet to dig past that. That means it can still leak out into our soil and our water, harming future generations.

&gt; No, not really. You either don't seem to understand the meaning of those words or grasp what I am saying.

I'm affraid you aren't grasping the incoherences inherent in your wishes.  The point /u/GetKenny makes is quite clear: if a central european government exists, one which is given power to dictate policy that is applied to and by all EU members, smaller states do have to lose their sovereignty.   They have to, because they cease to have a say on what EU policies they will and won't comply with.  

Moreover, democracy and the democratic process doesn't save anyone from having to comply with policies that they don't agree with.  It only guarantees that you have the right to participate in the process and to be heard, but once the votes are counted, the outcome is to be applied to everyone, whether they've voted for or against it.

Hence, the remarks regarding the contradictions and paradoxes inherent in your statements.

&gt; It isn't actually comparable - Scotland alone is dominated by London.

No, it's not.  To the best of my knowledge, [Scotland is represented in the house of commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MPs_for_constituencies_in_Scotland_2010%E2%80%93)  and participates in the democratic government of the UK.

Much like any EU member has the right to be involved in the EU government through its democratic process.

I believe I understand what you're trying to say: you wish that everyone in the EU gets along, agrees in any policy, that no policy is imposed against anyone's wishes and everything runs smoothly.

But that's not what happens in any government, let alone democracy.  Votes are cast, factions lose, the policy is still implemented.  Democracy only guarantees that everyone is represented, every position is represented, every relevant political group is heard.  It doesn't guarantee that everyone agrees with the conclusion, or that everyone will always have their way.",0,1410527362,null,0,false,0,ckg8h2v,t3_2g55d2,t1_ckg8h2v,t1_ckg4p5l,null,1427053278,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You can't just ignore the real reasons why Germany was cut in half and just put the fault on France.

You are a part of the problem. Germany deserve indeed admiration for what it did post WW2 and particulary the last 15 years.

But Germans **don't have any right to play the victimes in any way**. Germany brought what happened to her by herself.

I don't know why you are so hung up on Norwegian oil. Just a few years ago a large share of Finland's oil imports were from Norway, and the reason Finland switched to Russian oil was not lacking capacity in Norway but the Russian pipelines (plus the business opportunity to refine Russian crude into Brent crude and export it - yes, Finland is crude oil exporter).

And while it could be possible that Norway would decline to sell oil to Finland I don't think that particular *speculation* of yours is likely, and Norway is not the only oilproducer anyway.

&gt; No we don't.

**Yes, we DO** have other options readily available for Russian natural gas. Like I said it can be replaced by other fuels. The power plants affected are even designed with that in mind, and as I said there are plans ready if such situation was to arise.

&gt; There are no LNG terminals in Finland and there is no pipeline from Estonia to Finland.

Those are planned and years away. But so is the possibility of Finland's NATO membership, which was the basis of your *speculation* of Russia closing down oil and gas pipes to Finland.

Die Küche ist nicht für die Tiere. It's die Küche because it's in the nominative form, as it's the subject you're talking about.

Die Katze ist hier in der Küche. This time, die Katze is the subject, and it's in the kitchen. This time the kitchen is the object that the cat is sitting in so it's dative and 'der Küche'. Interestingly, if it was 'Die Katze geht in die Küche', the kitchen would be in the accusative form as the cat is moving to the object.

Basically nomimative = subject, accusative = object and to do with moving something somewhere and dative = indirect object or talking about the object of the sentence that's just sat there.

It seems I did, and I retract my previous statement, except for the part where I say some things can be more important than economics... a peaceful national identity that wants liberty is not necessarily a bad thing. There is also historical claim and a great deal of autonomy in the region including the police force and other authorities.

All that said I feel highly dubious about Catalonia's independence bid... I question the glossy nature of it all, the fact that they are all wearing mass produced identical clothing kind of reeks to me of some other party looking to piggy back off the Scottish independence bid. When you look behind the scenes, someone wealthy is funding this, and they are sure to have certain *interests* in gaining sudden power... a national spirit is an easy thing to take advantage of. The (seeming) fact that key figures behind the scenes have a family history of fraud and tax evasion... it all makes me smell a rat.

I guess my only reason in disgreeing with you is because I don't like hearing economic arguments against liberty, I fear the past repeating itself yet again, to the great disadvantage of those living in poverty.

No it's not. Citation here.

&gt; Amount of fuel needed is extremely small and nuclear reactors produce LESS radiation than conventional coal power plants. 

It's still more radiation than renewables.

You say:

&gt;It's the safest - the only accidents outside of Russia took natural disasters combined with human mistakes

but then:

&gt;Renewables are great in principle, but they are[...]and prone to causing accidental deaths.

When an accident with a renewable happens, a couple of people die  because a turbine was caught on fire while they were doing maintenance, or a roofer falls 10 meters while installing a solar panel. 

When a nuclear accident happens, cities become inhabitable waste lands out of a zombie apocalypse, food markets are shut or incapacitated for weeks until the threat has been dealt with and billions are spent on decommissioning the plant. Decades later you are taught about those disasters in school and the people who died trying to contain the problem are called heroes. All around the world you remember the victims and morn their deaths.

Things like Chernobyl and Fukushima happened and you have the nerve to say that renewables are ""prone"" to causing accidental deaths? 

Without searching, tell me **one** accident involving a renewable source that was half as bad as either Chernobyl, Three Miles Island, or Fukushima that caused comparable lost of human lives, comparable waste of land, comparable world disturbance (economy, markets, etc), comparable monetary costs and most importantly, comparable social impact. The fact that you can't should prove my point, but go on and search; you won't find anything anywhere near the same magnitude, let alone half.

&gt;It's the cheapest

I'll be damned if I get a source on this today! Let me show good faith, here are two articles showing how one renewable source (wind power) drives energy prices down:

[Article 1](http://aweablog.org/blog/post/wind-energy-blows-away-records-across-europe-driving-emissions-and-electricity-prices-down)
 [Article 2](http://tcktcktck.org/2014/07/wind-declared-cheapest-energy-source-denmark/63626)

Now do the same for nuclear.

&gt;they are expensive

Quite funny coming from someone advocating nuclear power, where a single nuclear plant costs more than any conventional solar or wind plant. Initial construction of the nuclear facilities **alone** [start at tenths of billions of dollars.](http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionC.htm#darlington) Do you have any idea how many wind turbines can you construct with 10 freaking billion dollars? So many that the peak power output is actually **higher** than a power plant.

Not to mention the second part, which is decomissioning the plant once it's life span is over. [That will only cost more $500 million dollars](http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/decommissioning.html), and this is the **typical cost**, the median value. I'm excluding things like [Fukushima costs'](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety) which are so high I won't even try to start an argument around this.

But, perhaps, you were referring to cost per kWh as the true assessment of nuclear's cost. Fair enough. In that case, [here's a graph citing 6 out of 7 studies which concluded that nuclear's cost per kWh is actually more expensive than even traditional coal and gas](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Nuke%2C_coal%2C_gas_generating_costs.png)

&gt;and resource intensive

R-resource... intensive? Their fuel is free! It's focking free! The only resources you need is the metal necessary to build the turbine, or the solar plant's mirrors, or the concrete's dam, which you'd need with any other power source. You can't expect to have a working plant without that minimum ""resource"" investment, but after that you're set! The sun shines for free, the wind blows for free, water goes downstream for free, gravity works for free.

Remember how I cited you the costs of a nuclear power plant? [Here's an article](http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/19/markets/uranium/index.htm) that shows that almost 30% of a nuclear plant's operating expenses come from it's fuel, uranium. And remember, uranium needs to be mined and refined much like traditional metal mining, or rare earth metal mining for photovoltaic panels. Then, it's waste needs to be continuously dealt with, needs to be stored AND cooled in a safe placed until we finally figure out what to do with it, something we've been trying to do for the past 50 years, and don't start throwing ""Gen IV"" power plants for which not a single one exists yet.

Now how is that for resource intensive?

&gt; John Hancock was a wealthy shipping magnate, who made the bulk of his money illegally by smuggling. Many colonials were smugglers, Hancock just happened to have a flair for it. Because the ever-tightening British policies that came about after the French and Indian War were aimed at his sort, he wholeheartedly took part in the call for Revolution.

&gt; John Hancock did not directly participate in the Boston tea party. But he stood to lose the most from the East India Company imports of English tea to Boston. On the other hand Samuel Adams who led the Mohawks aboard the British ships was so close to John Hancock that Bostonians even joked that ""Sam Adams writes the letters [to newspapers] and John Hancock pays the postage"".

""Kitchen"" is the object of the preposition ""in"" here, which means that you must use the *feminine dative* article, which happens to be ""der"", the same as the *masculine  nominative* article.

German has four such categories: *nominative*, *accusative*, *dative*, *genitive*

Basically,

nominative = subjects

accusative = direct objects

dative = indirect objects

genitive = possessors

It's important to note that the *gender* of ""kitchen"" never changes. The article of the noun phrase simply changes based on the role of the object in the sentence.

true,DanielShaww,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; so basically wind power is less safe than nuclear power, thats pretty much a fact if any.

If your understanding of ""safe"" is solely based on human lives lost, and, even worse, based on wind power (which is just one of many renewables) alone, then yes, I guess nuclear is indeed safer.

However, to tackle your point since you are a rare breed of people who provide sources around here: people die somewhere in the process of making or installing the turbine and, because that number turns out to be higher than the **direct** nuclear related deaths, you, and the article's author, assume that wind is indeed more dangerous than nuclear. For several reasons, that's decieving.

In that same article you linked, the author realizes that and even goes on saying:

&gt;Harness and personal protective gear for maintenance workers is also an easy fix and one that many other industries adopted to reduce worker death and harm.

and finishes it:

&gt; these are reasonable actions to take to make wind energy safer, especially since we anticipate wind farms to grow dramatically in the next 30 years.

Reasonable, don't you think? It's the way people are dying that makes the difference here, not necessarily the amount. They are dying in ways **parallel** to wind, not ways that are caused by it. They die in the same way [vending machines kill 13 people per year](http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/07/things-likely-kill-than-shark).

When someone dies in a nuclear power event, that's secondary and part of something way bigger.
If you don't mind, I'll quote myself in an answer I gave to someone before and forgive the rather agressive tone:

&gt;When an accident with a renewable happens, a couple of people die because a turbine was caught on fire while they were doing maintenance, or a roofer falls 10 meters while installing a solar panel.

&gt;When a nuclear accident happens, cities become inhabitable waste lands out of a zombie apocalypse, food markets are shut or incapacitated for weeks until the threat has been dealt with and billions are spent on decommissioning the plant. Decades later you are taught about those disasters in school and the people who died trying to contain the problem are called heroes. All around the world you remember the victims and morn their deaths.

&gt;Things like Chernobyl and Fukushima happened and you have the nerve to say that renewables are ""prone"" to causing accidental deaths?

&gt;Without searching, tell me one accident involving a renewable source that was half as bad as either Chernobyl, Three Miles Island, or Fukushima that caused comparable lost of human lives, comparable waste of land, comparable world disturbance (economy, markets, etc), comparable monetary costs and most importantly, comparable social impact. The fact that you can't should prove my point, but go on and search; you won't find anything anywhere near the same magnitude, let alone half.

Onto the another point

&gt; i cba to find a source but my windpower engineer buddy mentioned a nuclear power plant pay itself off in 2-3 years 

Yeah... when people start bringing anecdotes to an argument then the discussion starts going downhill (and you even started so well with a source try and prove your point). ""Well, uh, I also happen to have an engineer buddy and he mentioned nuclear plants kill kittens and their staff are literally Hitler."" Point is, and while I don't accuse you of lying, this won't lead anywhere. 

Not only that, it's completly bullshit. Not that you have an buddy engineer, but that it pays itself off in 2-3 years. Why? Because a **typical** power plants [costs short of $10 billion, e.g in link](http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionC.htm#darlington), **not to mention operation costs**. To pay itself in that time span means a revenue of $5 billion plus, so unless you can link me a source here, I'm calling bullshit. The windmill one tho seems right.

&gt;has a lifespan of 12-14 years depending on model (or something like that)

Nope, it's around 20 years, with modern ones expected to work for 30+.

[Article 1](http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2329938/study-wind-turbines-remain-efficient-for-at-least-25-years)    
[Article 2](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/02/25/3325551/wind-turbines-durable/)    
[Article 3 confirming 1](http://orendaenergy.com/wind-turbine-life-span-new-study-confirms-25-years/)

&gt;where you can easily upgrade it plenty of times.

No you can't. In fact, upgrading a nuclear plant is something you entirely won't do because of the core's radiation. Once its lifespan is over, it's decomissioned (and you pay top dollar for it) and that's it. If you disagree, link sources to it.

&gt;sure a dam could be better/cheaper but still dams are poop :o

Dams are cooooooooooooooool !  [Dams gone wild](https://www.google.com/search?q=dams&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=942&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bwMTVO7LI-WQ7AanpYHQBA&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ)

&gt;A gen4 nuclear power plant would only have to store the waste matter for 900~ years, thats pretty clean considering it gets done deep in a mountain shaft where nobody visits anyway. a generation 5-6 might take that waste and reduce it completely.

Neither of those exist at the moment, and Gen IV is expected **not to exist** for at least 30 more years. Who knows how muchrenewables will advance until then? I wonder why people assume inovation is only, or at least, mainly possible with nuclear power alone.

&gt;but it is bloody brilliant

Agreed

&gt;for the buck in most if not all categories.

Disagreed. And if you don't mind, I'll quote myself again:

&gt;Quite funny coming from someone advocating nuclear power, where a single nuclear plant costs more than any conventional solar or wind plant. Initial construction of the nuclear facilities **alone** [start at tenths of billions of dollars.](http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionC.htm#darlington) Do you have any idea how many wind turbines can you construct with 10 freaking billion dollars? So many that the peak power output is actually **higher** than a power plant.

&gt;Not to mention the second part, which is decomissioning the plant once it's life span is over. [That will only cost more $500 million dollars](http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/decommissioning.html), and this is the **typical cost**, the median value. I'm excluding things like [Fukushima costs'](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety) which are so high I won't even try to start an argument around this.

&gt;But, perhaps, you were referring to cost per kWh as the true assessment of nuclear's cost. Fair enough. In that case, [here's a graph citing 6 out of 7 studies which concluded that nuclear's cost per kWh is actually more expensive than even traditional coal and gas](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Nuke%2C_coal%2C_gas_generating_costs.png)",0,1410532463,null,0,false,0,ckgaku8,t3_2g3z49,t1_ckgaku8,t1_ckg59rv,null,1427052115,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The People of the United States put a two term term limit on Presidents *because we are rightfully afraid that any one leader would become too powerful if they remained in power too long.* Additionally, we assume, apparently, our assumption is now endangered, that any acts by any Legislature could be reversed by a subsequent Legislature if it was found to have been the product of an extrinsic fraud, as it were, for example, lawmakers serving under the wrongful presupposition that they acted on the people's behalf when they were actually in the employ of corporations, legal fictions that are not even human, a major ""conflict of interest"". 

 But these ""trade"" (trade is just a pretext) ""agreements"" which run ""forever"" violate that term limit, and I would venture to say that almost NO Americans realize that these abominations can be enacted by one corrupt (or honest) Legislature in such a way as to be irreversible. 

(Also, for the record, *they aren't really agreements if the people know nothing of them and have not been able to vote on their true contents in a referendum*) There is a very big reason that ISDS is suddenly a bone of contention globally - Its because ISDS is clearly being used as a vehicle for corporations to bypass democratic processes and grab power which is not rightfully theirs, not being the people. (Additionally. despite their being fictitious people, - a so called ""legal fiction"" used to allow them to be sued and sue, corporations, although composed of people are not living things, nor are they human, therefore to give them human rights as if they were, is a very big mistake.)",0,1410534352,null,0,1410534770,0,ckgbh1y,t3_2g2svc,t1_ckgbh1y,t1_ckg1vll,null,1427051516,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;The units in this table are so-called trend indicator values expressed in millions of [U.S. dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_dollar) at 1990s prices. These values do not represent real financial flows but are a crude instrument to estimate volumes of arms transfers, regardless of the contracted prices, which can be as low as zero in the case of military aid. Ordered by descending 2013 values. The information is from the [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRI).

Ordered by descending 2000–2010 values. The information is from the [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRI). 

&gt;Next to SIPRI there are several other sources that provide data on international transfers of arms. These include national reports by national governments about arms exports, the UN register on conventional arms and an annual publication by the [U.S. Congressional Research Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Congressional_Research_Service) that includes data on arms exports to developing countries as compiled by [U.S. intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_intelligence) agencies. A list of such sources can be found at the SIPRI website.  Due to the different methodologies and definitions used different sources often provide significantly different data. For example, according to [Statistisk sentralbyrå](http://www.ssb.no/vis/english/magazine/art-2008-03-12-01-en.html) (Norway state statistics), Norway exports a greater value (in USD) of arms than many of the nations listed above.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Sowas nennt man im allgemeinen Politikverdrossenheit.

Ach, Quatsch! So etwas nennt man ungerechtfertigte Enttäuschung angesichts unrealistischer Erwartungen.  Jeder, der trotz genug verfügbarer Freizeit die Ableistung seiner politischen Arbeit mit der Ausflucht, dass er ja sowieso nichts bewegen könne, begründet, versucht lediglich, dies vor sich und anderen rationalisierend zu rechtfertigen.  Wer nur dann sich politisch interessiert, wenn er gewinnt, ist ein demokratischer Opportunist.  Und auch Verdruss entbindet nicht von der Pflicht, sich selbst über die Themen auf dem Laufenden zu halten und sie verstehen zu wollen.

&gt; Und glaub mir, praktisch niemand setzt sich so intensiv mit diesen Themen auseinander. Die meisten lesen vielleicht noch den Prospekt, den es dazu gibt. Das sind ca 12 leicht verständliche Seiten zu jeder Abstimmung, Pro und Contra und die Empfehlung des Bundesrates ( = der Regierung).

Das ist zumindest schon einmal eine ganze Ecke mehr als, was meinem Eindruck nach in Deutschland vor Wahlen an Meinungsbildungsarbeit geleistet wird, nicht zuletzt deswegen, weil man sich hier seine Informationen selbst zusammensuchen muss, was eine signifikante Hürde ist.

&gt; Das hat nichts mit meiner ""mangelnden Empathie"" zu tun oder Naivität, sondern damit, dass eine demokratische Entscheidung auch ein Mindestmass an Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung haben muss. Das sag ich jetzt nicht aus irgendeinem akademischen Elfenbeinturm heraus. Abstinenz in der Politik bedeutet irgendwo auch eine Abstinenz in der Gesellschaft.

Das ist erstens eine absolut unnütze Aussage, weil sie vollkommen davon abhängig ist, wie man »Mindestmaß an Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung« definiert, und zweitens auch dann, wenn man es wie von Dir wohl intendiert interpretiert, nicht richtig, denn die Staatsform der Verfassungsrepublik, wie sie in Deutschland besteht, hat ja ihren Zweck gerade darin, dass die Verfassungsorgane die ochlokratischen Auswüchse des Pöbels abfedern sollen.  Dass das in Deutschland nicht wirklich funktioniert, ist Symptom der Tatsache, dass diese Staatsform hier im wesentlichen an die Wand gepinselt wurde.  Und selbst wenn Du in diesem Punkt Recht hättest, stellte sich aber hier die Frage, was bei politisch dringend notwendigen Entscheidungen zu tun wäre, wenn die für die Bildung von Rückhalt nötige Arbeit nicht mehr zu leisten wäre?  Sollte man dann einfach nichts tun und das System zur Not den Bach runtergehen lassen, sobald die Bevölkerungsmehrheit an ihre intellektuelle Tragfähigkeitsgrenze stößt? Oder sollte man doch auf die Alternative Gehorsam gegen die Obrigkeit zurückgreifen?

&gt; (danke für die Beleidigung btw, das ist echt nicht nötig)

Falls Du es als Beleidigung empfindest, wenn man Dich der Naivetät zeiht, dann solltest Du zum einen Deinen Begriff von Beleidigung schärfen.  Sein wesensbestimmendes Merkmal ist Ehrenrührigkeit, und Du wirst keinen Richter finden, der Dir in diesem Punkt beipflichten würde.  Zum anderen solltest Du einmal darüber nachdenken, was es über Dich aussagt, dass Du Anstoß daran nimmst, wenn jemand sich zu erdreisten wagt, Dich als naiv zu bezeichnen.

&gt; Aber: haben die ""intelektuelleren"" oder anspruchsvolleren Zeitungen mehr Einfluss als die Bild/Blick? Ich denke mal eher nicht. Vielleicht beim gebildeten Publikum.

Ach ja, und welche Zeitungen werden diejenigen, die ein Land wirklich am Laufen halten, eher lesen?  Boulevard- oder bildungsbürgerliche Presse?  Zeitungen wie die Bild mögen ob ihrer Auflagenstärke große Teile der Bevölkerung als Maneuvriermasse durch die Gegend bugsieren können, aber die Elite bildet sich ihre Meinung über das, was zu tun ist, immer noch in Zeitungen mit viel Text, langen Sätzen und wenigen Bildern.  Und die sitzen letztlich am längeren Hebel, weil sie auch in zehn oder zwanzig Jahren noch ihre Einflusspositionen innehaben werden.

&gt; Naja, das Volk ist ja qua definition immer der Wähler und will es wohl auch so.

Angesichts eines in allen westlichen Republiken signifikanten Nichtwähleranteils erschließt sich mir der Sinn einer solchen Aussage nicht.

&gt; Der Unterschied dürfte wohl eher darin liegen, dass Politiker in der Schweiz keine Berufspolitiker sind sondern das quasi ""nebenbei"" machen. Finde ich auch nicht so positiv, denn dadurch ergibt sich eine Scheinlegitimation von Politikern, die ""Hauptberuflich"" im Aufsichtsrat von Bank xyz oder Nestlé oder... sitzen

Dass Du das als schlechten Zustand ansiehst, irritiert mich, denn der Berufspolitiker, wie er in Deutschland und den USA besteht, wird allgemein als ein Missstand empfunden, da er mangels ökonomischer Unabhängigkeit in seiner Entscheidung nicht gänzlich frei ist (in Deutschland sichtbar an der Hörigkeit zur Linie der Partei, die über Karrieren entscheidet und diese beendet) und ferner über zu wenig Wissen über die alltägliche Lebenspraxis der normalen Leute hat, also weltfremd wird.  Oder wolltest Du so verstanden werden, dass in der Schweiz die meisten Politiker mittlerweile bloß Vollzeitlobbyisten irgendwelcher Großkonzerne sind?  Wenn ja, kannst Du hierzu Nachweise liefern?

true,masiakasaurus,ESPR,III Spanish Republic,"The formation of modern Basque and Catalan nationalism is directly tied to the end of the 19th century. The main factors were:

- Romanticism and the rediscovery of local languages by the upper, educated classes, until then relegated to the rural and popular world.

- Industrialization. Since the Middle Ages, the Basque Country was a hotspot of shipbuilding and trade with northern Europe, and so was Catalonia in regards to Italy and later the American colonies (which were ironically opened to them by their hated House of Bourbon, with the Habsburgs the only port allowed to trade with the Americas was Seville). The Basque Country also has the most important iron mines in the Iberian Peninsula. These money hotspots attracted industries and with them immigrants from elsewhere in Spain looking for a job, which led to a nativist sentiment among the locals who had to compete with them.

- Local institutions. The Basques have kept their autonomy from the Middle Ages to the modern day, and even during the Francoist dictatorship in the case of Alava and Navarre, by picking the right side in civil wars or being too much of a pain in the ass when they didn't. The Catalans of the 19th century made their loss of autonomy in the 18th a symbol and centerpiece of nationalist rethoric. 

Castile, for the most part, was fields and sheep. It was a place of emigration, not immigration. The popular and upper classes and the government all spoke the same language so it was hard to create a sentiment of ""us vs. them"". Finally, see how much Catalans bitch about their poor autonomy taken from them in the 18th century? Well, Castile went through the same process after the Comuneros revolt, under the Habsburgs, in the 16th century. Probably too far in time to be remembered and mourned by the 19th century generation(s).",0,1410534731,null,0,false,0,ckgbnkf,t3_2g0li2,t1_ckgbnkf,t1_ckfhku5,null,1427051382,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Come i parlamentari si appoggiano a tecnici per scrivere le leggi, pure la Pinotti avrà gestito gli accordi internazionali, preso la decisione di spedire armamenti e poi delegato ai tecnici del ministero il compito di produrre gli atti affinchè ciò avvenisse, se un giornalista è veramente interessato ai dettagli tecnici va alla conferenza stampa o contatta l'ufficio stampa del ministero, non insegue per strada il ministro cercando di metterle in bocca le risposte che lui preferisce; hanno rotto il cazzo i talk show politici che mandano in giro emuli di enrico lucci sperando che qualcuno li meni in diretta. un certo tipo di giornalismo ha senso solo se fatto con serietà (vedi report), altrimenti è un'espediente da due soldi.

[Picture of him](http://i.imgur.com/L7hFAlS.jpg)

During the 2003 EU referendum, this guy used his scare tactics to keep Malta out of the EU. He proceeded to run for MEP this year and won a seat with almost 50,000 votes. Do those people know what they voted for or is their mind only limited to Labour Party and Nationalist Party? I'll bet the same people who voted for him (who are Labour supporters themselves) also voted 'NO' in 2003.

From Wikipedia:

&gt;Sant campaigned heavily against Malta's European Union membership. During the run-up to the March 2003 referendum, Sant was also critical of what he called a ""sham referendum"" insisting that a general election alone would settle the EU membership issue. He called on Labour supporters to either vote No, abstain or invalidate their vote. He himself abstained. The Yes side won the referendum by a 54% to 46% margin but Sant claimed to have won the referendum as the Yes vote was less than half of registered voters. In view of the lack of consensus on the interpretation of the result, Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami asked the President to dissolve Parliament and call fresh elections. These were held in April 2003 and the Labour Party was again defeated at the polls.

&gt; Sant was the candidate who got the most votes with 48,739 votes of the electorate.

With stuff like this going on, who can blame anyone saying that Malta is Europe's greatest open-air insane asylum?

Neither party are trying to solve the problems of poverty and inequality and in fact they both want to make further cuts to public spending.

67% - Various forms of part of Ukraine

The ECB mandate is to maintain inflation stable and at an acceptable level, which is defined as a little bit under 2%. However the inflation in the Eurozone is very close to 0%, which raises fears of deflation. 

Deflation is very dangerous for economic growth, because in a way it compels companies and individuals to hold onto cash. The cash becomes an investment in itself, because it appreciates due to deflation. You can see this in action if you look at the big cash holdings of Apple, Microsoft and other big name companies. Also banks become hesitant to extend loans, and individuals spend less.

Two new recent factors add to existing deflation trend in Europe. First, after the Russian food embargo, the food prices in Europe decreased. And second, the oil prices are on a downtrend.

The deflation problem is actually quite acute in the Eurozone and a big concern for the ECB.

An increase in oil prices would act like the tide that lifted all boats, since the price of oil, directly or indirectly, affects the entire economy.

I guess we don't have the language differences between states or parts of states but we definitely have political and philosophical differences between communities. A minority of the legislature caused a government shutdown. The state of California with 38 million people has two senators, same as Wyoming which has like 500,000 and you can't pass anything through the congress without the support of the senate so an overwhelmingly popular political opinion from the liberal states can be held off indefinitely by a majority of Americans. 

What I'm saying is that living in a place with people you disagree with is just part of being a country. You shouldn't break up because you don't like how your money is spent. That's why we have democracies. We do have this happen on smaller scales in the US.
