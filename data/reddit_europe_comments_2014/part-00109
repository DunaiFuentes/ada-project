I'm sorry, what is disingenious? Recognizing that investments come with risks? Do they not?

&gt; Investing in other countries and having economies intertwined is an important deterrent to the escalation of conflicts. This is precisely why the EU started as the EEC - the European Economic Community.

Indeed. And that has also been one of the rationales in relation to Russia. Now, after Russia's actions how has the idea of intertwined economies worked as a deterrent so far? It hasn't. And it's not even a deterrent at all if you're not ready to use it as such and instead insist on business as usual whatever happens.

&gt; Of course such a relationship is not always symmetrical, and it sucks when your side would like to escalate things further and feels the resistance to do so. But that's the whole point and it's very hard to argue that we'd be better overall should we not have any economical ties to Russia.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; What we really need is a European Defense Pact, because only if people see Europe as one Entity they will see an incursion on a part thereof as an incursion against all.

This is ideal of course, but a little too idealistic. As of now, that sort of unity does not exist in Europe. This poses a problem. A side of effect of Russia's funny games in Ukraine is that Europeans are inherently looking at existing structures for security, i.e. NATO. Does Europe want to be in a position where it relies on an outside force for security? If not, is that reason enough to finally unify behind a common security apparatus? 

Many European countries are distracted right now with an economic crisis within their own borders. Sooner or later, they will need to look outward again and ask serious questions about a unified military force. Here is the paradox. Right now European countries have other problems in mind, yet the reasons for a unified military are more glaringly obvious than ever. So if now is not the time to be discussing this issue, then when is the right time?

There were plans to create unified army, but with the raise of nationalists and Eurosceptic parties - it's extremely unlikely to happen.

EU defence pact will never fulfil that role. EU countries are way too selfish and concentrated purely on self-defence to do anything at all. Even now in France there are plenty of voices against sending their forces to Poland in an act of solidarity with eastern EU countries - solidarity that doesn't require anyone to put his life on a line of fire (though French government did send them anyway).",0,1397747202,null,0,false,0,cguvgjn,t3_239ott,t1_cguvgjn,t1_cguupb9,null,1433397243,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

There are two things wrong with this statement, at least to a German. First, the statement ""I am proud to be [insert nationality here]"" is, to a German, very offensive. There is nothing to be proud of: it's an accident of birth. Second... you are not German.

You may *call* yourself German on the basis that your great-great-great-great-great-great-gandfather came from a place that is in what is now Germany, but you're American. And that's something you need to understand, because it is very important: you are not German. Germans -- and Europeans everywhere in fact -- hear Americans talking about how they're German, or Swedish, or Irish, or Polish, based purely on where their distant ancestors came from. Europeans would never do that, and find it weird and even creepy that Americans insist on doing it. You were born in America and know nothing of the German language, or of German culture, or (clearly) or German moral values.

&gt; Being proud of my own people emphatically does not mean I despise others.

No. But (a) there is no point in taking pride in an accident of birth, and (b) they are not, absolutely definitely not, ""your people"".

&gt; I am bound to Germany by my descent

Nobody is ever ""bound"" to a state by their descent.

&gt; Germany is the land of my forefathers

Is it, though? Did Germany even exist when your ancestors came over?

&gt; Why don't I listen to more modern music to build vocabulary? Put simply, it isn't my cup of tea.

So, you say that you feel some kind of mystical special bond with Germany and want to improve your vocabulary, but the vocabulary you want to learn is vocabulary that is out of date and would make you sound like either a 19th century poet stuck in a time warp, or a political extremist.

And why only patriotic music? That's ridiculous: there are plenty of other songs. Why specifically the ""patriotic"" ones? Why the ones that the Nazis used and misused? You'd never be able to sing them in Germany unless you went to a neo-Nazi rally.

&gt; I mean you no harm, but was truly offended by the accusations I have received.

And a lot of Germans were truly offended by your request. You wax lyrical about some of Germany's proudest achievements, but one of the things Germans are most proud of is that they have risen from the ashes of WW2, rebuilt their country and -- and this is their proudest boast by far -- rejected patriotism, jingoism and nationalism in favour of a more tolerant and equitable outlook.

If you truly believe yourself to be German, you will understand that what you are asking for is strictly taboo in German culture. You will respect that, and you will also understand that your pride in a nation on the basis of where your distant ancestors came from *will* be judged very negatively.

If you're not willing to even take this on board, you have even less right to call yourself ""German"".

The European Commission has a mandate to consider much stronger sanctions, but large European energy firms like BP, ENI and others are applying an incredible amount of pressure (aka lobbying) on the Member States not to impose tough sanctions on Russia, because it will harm European economies and consumers (and, coincidentally, the energy firms' bottom lines, but they somehow forget to mention this...)",0,1397747913,null,0,false,0,cguvt06,t3_2391ra,t1_cguvt06,t1_cguvle4,null,1433397406,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

That is a lie. Ukraine was never going to buy any gas from EU. The deal was for less trade regulations with EU, meaning Ukrainian businesses had more freedom to co-operate with EU businesses.  Russia however said they did not like this, as it would tie Ukraine closer to EU, and forced the president to avoid signing the agreement.

&gt;Why did violence suddenly reach extreme levels?

Because peaceful protesting was made illegal, and people werent willing to be stripped of their freedom.

The police used live ammunition against protesters. They also brutally beat and in some cases tortured them. The action of the police is persisely what escalated the problem.

Easily? Over 100 people died, the economy is on the verge of collapse, and now Ukraine is being invaded by Russia.

""Plenty"" does not show the percentage, ""can't afford anything"" does not say what you consider ""affording things"", it does not show where you live (living in the center of London is expensive, no one is arguing over that) that your rent and heating costs so much. 

People from rich countries are entitled, they do not see the superiority of their society and the plentifulness in which they live. I don't even want to talk about this, it makes me mad. Just compare simple things like this:


A Snickers bar costs less than 1$ in the U.S., assuming you're living on minimum wage (which we'll assume is 9$) you can buy at least 1440 of those a month. 

Now, in Moldova it costs the same (or more), assuming you're living on minimum salary (70$), you can buy 70 of those. Nice, huh? Meanwhile, gas prices are going to be the same as in Europe for Moldova if we don't stick with Russia. How are we going to pay for the same heating with a salary *twenty* times smaller. Think about that - twenty. times. 

How often do you fully cook your meals and how often do you buy pre-cooked meals? Honestly? How often do you just order a pizza? You know that the latter are much more expensive and no average man can afford buying prepared food here? Everyone buys potatoes and fries them and that's your meal. Fried potatoes. And also the cheapest brand of pasta with a little bit of butter. Don't tell me potatoes are so freaking expensive in the U.K. that you can't afford eating.

In Europe universal health care will cover your medical expenses, in Moldova insurance gets you 7 free days a year in a hospital and free *consultation* (any tests price not included), and *some* help for those with chronic diseases.

true,vasotheserb,SERB,Serbia,"&gt; That is a lie. Ukraine was never going to buy any gas from EU. The deal was for less trade regulations with EU, meaning Ukrainian businesses had more freedom to co-operate with EU businesses. Russia however said they did not like this, as it would tie Ukraine closer to EU, and forced the president to avoid signing the agreement.

Russia did not ""force"" Ukraine, it was just a better business deal for the Ukrainians to pay less for gas.

&gt; Because peaceful protesting was made illegal, and people werent willing to be stripped of their freedom.

Or because the west hired fake demonstrators to spark the Ukrainians into riots (mob mentality)

&gt; The police used live ammunition against protesters. They also brutally beat and in some cases tortured them. The action of the police is persisely what escalated the problem.

No, it was the actions of the mislead people that escalated the problem

I actually should have clarified, because I meant ""swift"", not easily. How fast did the revolution take? A month, maybe? Only a month? How?

&gt; No they werent. Yanukovych was impeached for abuse of power. His own political party abandoned and condemned his actions. The last 3 presidents of Ukraine also condemned his actions. Many of the people in power were part of the ""legitimate"" government, which scheduled a fair election to get back on track.

Even though Yanukovych was corrupt, he was legitimately elected and had legitimacy ruling authority. Acting fascist PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk is illegitimate and that's the point I was trying to make.

Is it not legitimate for one entity to defend another entity from a third entity?

The general unrest in the Ukraine began with western interests destabilizing the country.  And, for better or worse, like it or not, Russia might reasonably be expected to have an interest in the political affairs of a neighboring country and ally after it has been destabilized by foreign interests.    

And note... this isn't really about taking Russia's side.  I think Putin is a corrupt authoritarian and I think the EU powers are corrupt and authoritarian.  But few people seem inclined to discuss the events honestly and comprehensively from a neutral perspective.  And fewer people still seem concerned about reducing the conflict in Ukraine.

Even though the revolution happened in 1989, the King was still banned from the country until '92. When he returned in '92, 2 million people were shouting "" Majestate nu pleca ! Romania e a ta !"" (""Don't leave, your Majesty ! Romania is yours!"" - it rhymes in Romanian. :D). Upon seeing that, Ion Iliescu (the first president after the revolution), fearing that he might lose power, decided that it would be best to ban the King again. So the King was banned yet again until '97. 

Secondly, because it makes me sick to look at our political elite. There is so much corruption, so many petty quarrels between them, so much stupidity and dumbness. You might think- oh, those things are present here in Belgium as well - but believe me, Belgium's political landscape is heaven compared to Romania's political landscape. King Michael is a honorable, intelligent, mannered gentleman. He is FAR superior to the president.

FYI, majority of American's family's have immigrated in the past 150 years.  A sixth generation grandfather would put the immigration date around the turn of the 18th century (based on avg lifespan). 

You seem to be confusing nationality and ethnicity here (so is OP in thinking germanic ethnicity means he should have national pride) at least in the context of the American's general discourse.  Ethnicity is denoted by literally your DNA (check out [haplogroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup)).  Ignorance of culture or language does not change your ethnic background.

Unfortunately ignorance is somewhat prevalent in the US in terms of this discussion because kids grow up knowing they are ""American"" (nationality) and stating they are German or Irish or Polish to denote their ethnicity (when in reality they should state it as being American of Germanic descent).

&gt;  Germans -- and Europeans everywhere in fact -- hear Americans talking about how they're German, or Swedish, or Irish, or Polish, based purely on where their distant ancestors came from. Europeans would never do that, and find it weird and even creepy that Americans insist on doing it.

That's incredibly wrong.  So a Dane who's parents immigrated to Britain and is raised within the British system no longer calls himself Danish?  His nationality may be British, however he is still of Danish ethnicity.  The difference here for Americans is that most of the time their ethnic backgrounds is a slurried mix, with the majority being Germanic and Irish background.

I realize this, and they're failing. They should change their mandate to read price stability *in Germany*. 

&gt;But that will raise bunch of other issues, for example even more permanent transfers from north to south. Or should the north suffer from inflation to save the south?

This is what happens in every currency union except the Euro. Federal taxation smooths out instances when one monetary system doesn't fit every user. When you look at the USD, the right monetary policy for New York might not be the right one for Mississippi. Federal transfers help smooth this out. This difference becomes even more acute when you look at US territories. 20-25% of Puerto Rico's economy is made up of federal transfers. It is very clear Puerto Rico's economy if much different than New York or California's but these transfers allow it to use the Dollar relatively problem free.  

The high output states (including mine) pay for this. Federal income tax are by far the largest tax burden in the US for people and companies. For me, 30% of my federal taxes go to lower income states. One state its up to 45%. That is what happens in a currency union, unless you want the low income users to suffer at the expense of the high income users.

Ukraine needs reforms and open to trade with more countries.

I didn't start looking at whats going on in Ukraine in the last few week. Things don't come out of nothing. It is all a continuation of a reality that now is news and tomorrow is history, and the best knowledge you can get from it is when you have lived through that same history when it was news, or have been close to it in person.  

I don't only read news from English sources, and any source for me is good as I know how to spot a good article and a biased piece of shit. Why? Because I'm not a kid that just started discussing politics and economy yesterday because it makes me look like an adult. 

I don't rely only on what I read, but also on what I see out there on reality, and that is the best way that anybody can discern and draw conclusions out of what we watch and read. That is what gives us the wisdom to discuss this matters, otherwise, just by feeding ourselves with information without experiencing the real world, we will be nothing more than stupid sheep.

Fortunately, due to my field of work, and other opportunities, I lived temporarily in Ukraine, Russia, and many other countries that got me to know and understand better what's going on around the world in many aspects. Now if you think that I don't have arguments, why don't you try to start with question rather than with bullshit that makes any decently informed human to feel ashamed of his own race?

How close is she to the family otherwise? Taking out of paid holiday for sickness is definitely not right as it states in any German Au Pair regulations. Has she just expressed that concern with the family? If she has and they don't care maybe she should find another family. I found one within a week of leaving my first family.

Nah. Governments have the right to do stuff only at the behest of the people. If the people don't know what's going on, then it's no longer a government by the people for the people. It's cowards who forget what it means to be a free person, who think that the government is some sort of super special organization that's designed to keep them ""safe"" at any cost against the ""bad guys"" so they can do whatever they want, that are the real traitors. These idiots will rave about ""terrorists"" but at the same time get pissed off that they have an obligation to pay into healthcare, and ignore the 400,000 killed annually by tobacco (what is that like, 130 9/11s? Math isn't their strong suit, either.)  

The entire world has a right to know what these governments (not just the US, but all of 'em) are up to.

&gt; You seem to be confusing nationality and ethnicity here

Nobody in Europe thinks that ""German"" is an ethnicity.

&gt; Ethnicity is denoted by literally your DNA

Yes, but you can't drill down to that kind of level. Even if you managed to isolate the part of his DNA that came from his German ancestor, it will probably be a mix of haplogroups from all over Europe and very likely North Africa and Mongolia as well. In terms of DNA, it simply doesn't make sense to talk about an ""ethnic German"" as distinct from, say, an ""ethnic Dutchman"", not if you go by DNA. And land borders have changed so much -- they change constantly, all the time. What about the people of Schleswig-Holstein: do they count as ethnic Germans or ethnic Danes? What about ethnic Austrians -- they're more closely related to Bavarians than Bavarians are to Prussians. Are Austrians Germans, or are Bavarians Austrians?

You're right to point out that there is a difference between nationality and ethnicity, but then you commit the same error. Ethnically, DNA analysis might reveal that some of us are mostly West European, Finnic, Scandinavian, Caucasian or Balkan. Well, almost certainly a mixture of most of them, actually. But you won't get much more detail than that.

&gt; So a Dane who's parents immigrated to Britain

We've got lots of those. They used to be called ""Vikings"", though.

&gt; no longer calls himself Danish?

He might. More likely, though, going by personal experience, he will say that his parents are Danish. If he marries a Brit and they have children, they will probably identify as British with a Danish father. *Their* children will be fascinated to learn that one of their grandfathers was born in Denmark; the next generation won't care because such things are unimportant.

Why is this ""incredibly wrong""? Look at a map of Europe and read up a little on European history: the tiny, tiny countries, the wars, the mass migrations, the invasions, the intermingling of cultures -- do you really think that ""ethnic German"" makes any kind of sense at all?",0,1397755745,null,0,false,0,cguzs5v,t3_239ssn,t1_cguzs5v,t1_cguxdgt,null,1433399346,1,false,SCHLAND,t5_2w5wj,1

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"That's exactly what I mean though, his game theory analysis is terrible. Or rather, elementary; it's the sort of thing you'd see in the first half of a game theory introduction class, used when you're just learning definitions and how decision trees work. It's not really applicable to real situations.

To begin with, his endpoints are ""US responds causing nuclear war"" (terrible), ""US responds, causing conventional global war"" (terrible) and ""US does nothing"" (neutral). But these points are flawed. Nuclear war would obviously be terrible, no argument on that point. Conentional war though is a bit different. By any relevent metric, Russia is outmatched. NATO has more soldiers, better soldiers, better equipment, and multiple staging grounds to launch an attack. A conventional war with Russia would certainly be much worse than any conflict we've seen over the last couple decades, but it would most definitely be a NATO victory. While war is bad, victory would completely cement the dominance of NATO in Europe, and greatly increase its position when dealing with future conflicts in Eurasia. I'd hesitate to call this outcome ""good"", but it's certainly not a catastrophe. 

The non action option however is much worse. In this instance, it's presented as a sort of neutral position; we don't gain anything, but we don't lose anything of value. This is patently false. Not respecting NATO commitments would utterly destroy all credibility that the US has in the international sphere, and would likely take the economy, which would cause a negative spiral throughout the West. While not as bad as a nuclear war, this option is still pretty bad.

The other issue is that the author is assuming that all actors are selfinterested and completely logical, by which I mean that each actor is only out for their own benefit (has no particular interest in hurting their opponent), and will always pick the ""best"" choice, even if the ""best"" option is awful (as long as it is less awful than the alternative). Note that while this actor archetype is one of the basic actors used, even in introductory game theory, it is not the *only* archetype used.

The problem is that, using this logic, we shouldn't even be having this conversation, because it would be in the best interests of NATO to just invade Russia immediately. If this were to happen, the Russians would be left with three options, conventional war, nuclear war, or surrendering to whatever NATO has planned. With nuclear war they risk their own extinction, so that's out. They'll probably lose a conventional war, so this choice is the same as surrender, but with more pain first. So their only reasonable choice is to just give in to NATO. 

Obviously, that's not a realistic outcome. In the real world, it's assumed that each side is perfectly willing to spite the other, and it is entirely possible that one side might choose death instead of defeat. While there's no way to know for certain, each side potentially operates as a vengeful player instead of a logical one, which breaks down the game logic.

**tl;dr The author is trying to apply very basic theory to the real world, and is doing a bad job of it. His proposed endpoints are not good estimations of the real endpoints, and he does not take into account player characteristics.**

&gt;
“Our answer was and remains a categorical refusal — the jurisdiction of Russia does not extend to Ukrainian users of VKontakte. Turning over the personal data of Ukrainians to Russian auhtorities would not only be a violation of the law, but betrayal of all those millions of residents of Ukraine who trusted us.
&gt;
In the process, I have had to sacrifice a lot. In particular, I sold my share in VKontakte, since its presence could prevent me from making the correct decisions. But I don’t regret anything — protection of people’s personal data is worth it and much more. Since December 2013, I don’t have any property, but I have something more important — a clean conscience and ideals which I am prepared to defend.”

No, but ignoring deflation as long as its not happening in the North is stretching the definition of maintaining price stability. 

&gt;And what you are suggesting- permanent transfers to the south demands a renegotiation and new treaties to. And- approval by all the countries. Do you think the citizens in the north will vote yes to permanent transfers?

I think it would be next to impossible to pass a federal taxation/spending/budgetary policy. Germany completely dismissed the idea of centralized financing through a Eurobond. They are more concerned with their national stability than the entire Eurozone, and I certainly dont fault them for that. But monetary integration without fiscal integration is like walking on egg shells. Usually these two things go hand and hand, and with the Euro they are completely separate. 

&gt;Your suggestions are not legal and I am sure you do not want only legal, but also democratic and popular support. So what will you do?

I completely understand this. So did the framers of the Euro. There is not much that can be done now given the structure. A federalized spending system would be unpopular in the north due to transfers, and unpopular in the south due to the fact they would lose control of their budgets. So I understand what is best is not going to be what happens. 

But these things should have been discussed and plans should have been made before the Euro was implemented. They likely were discussed, and that is what the Bloomberg case was all about. But I guess that information is for the governments to know not the public, according to the ECJ.

All of this said, the ECB could say it was following its mandate if it started tackling deflation in the south. It could direct currency creation at the southern nations. Granted, all of it would not stay there, but it could try to cause higher price increases there than in the North. I definitely dont think QE would be illegal at this point.

Until they can break that incredibly bad and self destructive habit, they are bound to lives of servitude, starvation and destitution at the hands of their perceived 'superiors'.

The community to watch is the one currently most oppressed by the smallest margin of oppressors to subjugates; that is China.

So you assume that all mainstream news sources are all biased or manipulated with agendas?

Well... Conspiracy theorists love non mainstream sources only, most of them with non verified contents, and they don't care from their reputation since they don't care for the average citizen but for their niche which is enough for them to make a buck. 

&gt;  I am arguing that the current government in Ukraine is fascist and Neo-Nazi

What makes you believe that??

The current government only got 20 seats replaced out of more than 300... so you are saying that they were Neo Nazis before also, right?

You know where the Nazi rhetoric comes from?  

&gt;  I just view myself as someone who has a formulated opinion after careful evaluation of all data.

Really??

Well, I have been been watching carefully all data and have formulated an opinion that the current government in Kiev is not Nazi, is working hard to stabilize the country but still being undermined by corrupt politicians that have strong connection with Russia, and being destabilized by Russian insurgents in the east to prevent them from carrying on with their work. So, what makes you more right than me??

The former president was overthrown not by, but with help of a group that are considered Nazis, however they are smaller than pro-Russians try to make it, and their party only got 4 seats in the government. Since they are a group, and from the moment that they live and act under the law, they have the right to have members representing them in the government as any other group. This is the basis of democracy. The same democracy that gives right to pro-Russians to have their representatives in the government as they have, even when they are preventing progress on stability.

The fact that there are Nazis in the west there's also in the east. Russia is always putting up with their rhetoric about it, but deny and hide the fact that Neo-Nazis is a big problem in Russia, where they commit crimes almost on a daily basis. 
Also, the eastern Ukrainians point the western as Nazis, but in fact they are the ones wanting to divide the people based on ethnicity, wanting Jews to get registered or face deportation and so on. 

It is known as a strategy by Russians to points others as being Nazis and Fascists to hide their Nazi and Fascist tendencies. 

What do you call to Putin actions of wanting to protect Russian ethnics, divide people and separate them according to ethnics, while most of the world already learned and live in balance with multi-ethnics and multi-culturalism, and is leaving peacefully ? Do you think that Nazism is just being anti-Jews?? If you knew the Russian society well, if you lived there you would have learned that it is one of the most xenophobic societies, that heavily cultivates xenophobia and hate against people other than Slavs.

&gt; All sides must refrain from any violence, intimidation or provocative actions. The participants strongly condemned and rejected all expressions of extremism, racism and religious intolerance, including anti-semitism.
&gt;
All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets, squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated.

So, what's in it to prevent the extremist groups to continue being armed, occupying buildings and using violence? 

They weren't in the negotiations and they haven't made any of the promises in the agreement. And they could just as well wipe their asses with it especially now that Ukraine has agreed not to use force, and Russia still has its 40,000 troops ready for action right across the border.

Ukraine is likely to have succumbed to at least some of these demands. However, I doubt those demands will be permanent. Austria has constitutionally enforced neutrality, which is why it isn't a NATO member, but it still joined the EU which largely gets round the neutrality clause. Given democratic will within Ukraine and the desire by many Europeans for Ukraine to become more integrated with the EU, I doubt the EU or even US would have agreed to anything which would compromise Ukraine's ability to join the EU.

Wir leben in einer pluralistischen, demokratischen Gesellschaft. Daraus folgt zwingend, dass es viele verschiedene, konkurrierende, im Widerspruch stehende Meinungen und Weltanschauungen gibt, (leider auch Antidemokratische.)

Damit müssen wir aber klarkommen, auch wenn wir manche Meinungen nur sehr schwer ertragen. Wir können diese Meinungen bekämpfen, mit Kritik, mit Argumenten, mit Satire, etc... 

Aber für geistig unmündig erklären! Das Wort hat ja auch eine juristische Bedeutung. (Wahlverbot, etc.) 

Wenn wir fordern Bürgen aufgrund ihrer Gesinnung das Recht auf Selbstbestimmung zu nehmen, dann sind wir keine astreinen Demokraten mehr. Dann haben wir eine pluralistischen, demokratischen Gesellschaft nicht verdient. 

Dann wollen wir die Gleicheren unter den Gleichen sein.

On propose de tester 500+ élèves sur la base du volontariat. Outre le problème que ça pose déjà au niveau de la vie privée, allez on peu dire que pour le bien de l'enquête on passera les problèmes de vie privée.

On se rend compte ensuite que tout refus sera sanctionné d'une garde à vue et donc dans le cadre de la garde à vue, on fera quand même un test ADN. Mais en plus, sans même parler de garde à vue, on voit bien que l'élève qui a refusé s'est vu intimider par un magistrat.


Grave manquement aux droits de tous ces élèves mais on est prêt à taire cela sous la pression. Si on proteste on est à la fois étiqueté directement comme une espèce de monstre qui refuserait la justice à une fille violée mais on est en plus accusé par la justice d'être un violeur.

C'est grave, atroce, et franchement ça me dégoûte. J'espère de tout coeur que cette fille recevra justice mais ici ce n'est que de la parodie.

&gt;L'article 63 du Traité sur le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne interdit toute restriction aux échanges de services et de capitaux entre les Etats membres et les Etats membres et des pays tiers.
 
Je ne comprends pas le rapport avec la phrase précédente. 

&gt;Avant, une entreprise devait demander l'autorisation au ministère des Finances pour investir à l'étranger, et l'Etat décidait si c'était conforme aux intérêts des Français ; si ça l'était, c'était oui, si ça ne l'était pas, c'était non. C'est d'ailleurs comme ça que Peugeot à pu s'installer en Iran, puisque le savoir-faire allait être conservé, la marchandise n'allait pas être revendue aux Français mais aux Iraniens et il y avait un marché prometteur.

Ouf, si l'Etat dit oui alors on est sauvé. 

&gt;Maintenant ça n'est plus possible, les traités européens sont un feu vert généralisé pour les délocalisations vers des pays à très bas coûts de salaire, et le rapatriement des produits. L'article 32 encourage tout cela. Bien évidemment que les entreprises françaises ne peuvent pas survrivre si elles sont placées en concurrence directe avec des Vietnamiens ou des Marocains...à moins qu'elle délocalisent elle-aussi. 

Elle ne peuvent pas survivre non plus sans les innovations, les matières premières, les marchés de l'étranger. Sauf à rester dans un aquarium clos et là je rigole grave.

&gt;Cerise sur le gâteau, ces ouvertures n'ont pas été acceptées par les pays en-dehors de l'UE, d'où leur émergeance. L'UE qui nous ""protègerait"" de la mondialisation est un mythe.

Oui, c'est uniquement l'Europe qui a créé la croissance chinoise. Arrêtons la fumette. **SVP**

&gt;La France fait partie du marché interne. Pour autant que sache, ça n'est pas elle qui décide des droits de douane pour l'UE à l'OMC, c'est le Commissaire au commerce (actuellement Karel de Gucht), et il décide du même coup de ce qui peut rentrer ou non en France.

Non, ce n'est pas le commissaire européen qui décide seul. Il écoute ( en fait obéit ) les recommendations du Conseil Européen : La commission et l'Europe sont un échelon de tractation pour la France. Ce que j'ai dit exactement. Je vois que la désinformation@latroïka a bien focntionné. 

On peut quand même se demander pourquoi personne n'écoute la France ? Parce qu'on envoie des tocards au Parlement, qu'on fait la leçon à tout le monde, qu'on a des clows au pouvoir et qu'on est quasiment aussi crédible que la Grèce sur la parole donnée ( voire moins en 2014 ). 

&gt;Il me semble également que la PAC fait partie du budget européen ; or la France est un contributeur net...ce qui voudrait dire que les aides que reçoivent nos agriculteurs proviennent de notre poche.

Enfin, c'est normal ? Les subventions viendraient d'où sinon ? De mon c.. ? C'était un exemple. Je dis juste que la défense de la PAC dont le poids dans le budget est énorme provient avant tout de la France qui en a fait son cheval de bataille ( notamment Chirac ), forcément on doit faire des concessions. Cela s'appelle la diplomatie. Pour faire simple, on peut pas avoir le beurre, l'argent du beurre et le cul de la crémière. On a abandonné le textile pour que Chirac puisse aller donner des claques au cul des vaches pendant le salon de l'agriculture. Pas que le textile soit foncièrement important pour l'économie française. 

&gt;N'exagérons pas non plus, sinon comment expliques-tu que la France soit dans le top 10 mondial des puissances économiques...

En s'adaptant, en profitant des innovations qui ne sont pas faites chez nous, en exportant, en important et en produisant. D'autres questions ? 

&gt;De Gaulle avait voulu une Europe libre de l'influence des Etats-Unis et menée par la France avec le Traité de Paris. Les Allemands ont ratifié un préambule qui incluait ce que De Gaulle avait voulu éviter, notamment l'entrée du RU, l'appartanance à l'OTAN et une alliance étroite avec les Etats-Unis. Le ""couple franco-allemand"" est un mort-né. Ca montre qu'il n'y a pas ""d'autre Europe"" possible et que ça fait 45 ans que ses anaylses sont confirmées par les évènements. Les européistes auraient peut-être besoin d'une paire de lunettes, sinon de jumelles

De Gaulle est un menteur et un mégalo, ça tombe bien on a eu quasiment que ça dans la Ve qui est bien à son image. La France n'a jamais quitté l'OTAN, la France n'a pas laissé entrer le RU par altruisme, on y a beaucoup gagné notamment sur notre programme nucléaire qui avait du mal à décoller. On était complètement en position de force avec le RU qui crevait la gueule ouverte en dehors du marché européen ( la preuve qu'il est indispensable et qu'on se tirerait une balle dans le pied en le quittant ). Si 40 ans après, on s'en mord les doigts, c'est notre faute d'être incapable de jouer une main gagnante. 

&gt;C'est surtout le droit européen qui prime sur le droit national, plus précisément la compétence exclusive que détient l'UE concernant l'établissement des règles de concurrence nécessaires au fonctionnement du marché intérieur (article 3 du TFUE)

Non, c'est surtout de dire ""C'est la faute à l'Europe"" alors que l'alternative dans le cas d'Arcelor était de spolier les actionnaires. 

&gt;Exemple parfait des intérêts nationaux divérgents, quelle industrie voudrais-tu que le Luxembourg protège ? Ce qui compte pour eux, c'est la libre circulation des capitaux et une fiscalité plus souple que tous les autres. Comment harmoniser cela avec les intérêts de la France ?

L'entreprise étant franco-luxembourgeoise, les intérêts n'étaient pas divergents. Donc 1) tu ne lis pas 2) tu tournes à vide.

Hab ich was verpasst, oder fehlt bei mir jegliche Beziehung zu dir/ Vergleich unserer rhetorischer Fähigkeiten? Mal davon abgesehen, dass Ich gar kein guter Rhetoriker bin. Zumindest denke Ich das.

&gt;Wir leben in einer pluralistischen, demokratischen Gesellschaft. Daraus folgt zwingend, dass es viele verschiedene, konkurrierende, im Widerspruch stehende Meinungen und Weltanschauungen gibt, (leider auch Antidemokratische.)

&gt;Damit müssen wir aber klarkommen, auch wenn wir manche Meinungen nur sehr schwer ertragen. Wir können diese Meinungen bekämpfen, mit Kritik, mit Argumenten, mit Satire, etc... 

Jaja, schon klar, inwiefern das Prinip ""Pluralismus"" aber das Prinzip ""geistige Mündigkeit"" aushebelt, verstehe Ich nicht. Wenn es viele verschiedene Denkweisen gibt, gibt es ja immer noch welche die rational begründet werden können und Irrationale. Dementsprechend gibt es politische Anschauungen die ich nicht vertrete, aber deren Vertretern Ich nie ihre geistige Mündigkeit absprechen würde.

Betrachte Ich dagegen zb religiöse Fanatiker, Esoteriker, Antisemiten, Rassisten usw, dann bekomme Ich leichte Anfälle. Die Liste lässt sich mit beliebigen absurden, irrationalen Gedankenstrukturen fortsetzen.

Würden die Leute ihren Verstand benutzen, hätten sie ordentlichen Zugang zu Bildung und würden den Wert schätzen, dann würden die nie im Leben auf so ne Scheiße wie Freie Energie usw kommen. Allgemein würde niemand dieser ganzen Szene auf den Leim gehen.

&gt;Aber für geistig unmündig erklären! Das Wort hat ja auch eine juristische Bedeutung. (Wahlverbot, etc.)

Hat sich also doch herauskristalliersiert, dass alles ein Missverständnis ist. Wunderbar. Wieder einmal hat sich bewiesen, dass das Konnotat-Denotat Verhältnis der Sprache uns manchmal trollen kann.

Ich meine natürlich  [Kants](http://www.philolex.de/kant.htm) [philosophisches Prinzip der ""Mündigkeit""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCndigkeit_%28Philosophie%29), welches rein gar nichts mit der[ juristischen Definition](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entm%C3%BCndigung) zu tun hat und [begrifflich abzutrennen ist.](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCndigkeit)

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"Die Frau redet natürlich jede Menge Blech. 

Beispiel: ""Warum werden die Vorgänge in der Ostukraine immer mit der Krim verglichen und nicht mit dem was in Kiev passiert ist? Das wäre doch treffender."" 

Ganz einfach: Weil in Kiev Demonstranten auf der Straße waren. Auf dem Maidan. Ganz zum Schluß gab es ein paar Heckenschützen, bei denen nicht ganz klar ist, von welcher Seite die kamen. Das wird noch untersucht. In der Ostukraine und auf der Krim sind es unformierte Soldaten mit automatischen Waffen, die nichts mit Demonstrationen am Hut haben und strategisch wichtige Gebäude besetzen, bzw. dort Waffenlager plündern. Auf der Krim stellte sich schnell heraus, dass es sich um russische Spezialeinheiten handelte, was Putin ja bis gestern abstritt. Jetzt gibt er es zu, um zu erklären, dass es einen Unterschied gibt zwischen der Krim (ja, da waren es russische Soldaten, die dort die Krim besetzten) und der Ostukraine (ja die sehen genauso aus, sind aber in Wirklichkeit keine russischen Soldaten, vorher habe ich gelogen, jetzt sage ich die Wahrheit). 

Und so redet sich die Frau um Kopf und Kragen. 

Ich finde diesen Beitrag jedoch unglaublich erhellend, weil er mit endlich erklärt, warum sooooo viele Spinner glauben, dass unsere Presse angeblich einseitig berichtet. 

Das geht los mit Brüssel als Hort der Freiheit und Moskau als Hort des Bösen, was angeblich nicht so wäre. Tja. Ist aber so. Auch wenn unsere EU-Außenpolitik (siehe Ruanda, Lybien, Somalia, Irak) irgendwie nicht viel besser aussieht als die von Russland (Tschetschenien) sind jedoch innerhalb der EU die Zustände viel, viel besser als anderswo. Und indem die Ukraine sich der EU zuwendet, wendet sie sich der Freiheit zu. 

Und das scheinen viele Leute nicht zu begreifen. Weil sie eben keine Ahnung von den Zuständen in Russland haben. Die Journalisten sind dagegen sehr sensibilisiert. Besonders, weil gerade Russland sehr hart mit kritischen Journalisten umgeht (die werden von dunklen Männern in der Regel erschossen). 

Putin ist offenbar sehr populär, weil er es geschafft hat, die Probleme Russlands unter den Teppich zu kehren. Indem er die Pressefreiheit abgeschafft hat, die vorher immer über diese Probleme berichtet hatte. Und so steht er als strahlender Held da. Daher kommt auch viel von dem ""angeblich"" und ""behauptet"", das immer zu den Aussagen von Putin dazugefügt wird. Was ja die Frau Kron-Schmalz so doof findet. Jedoch unter der gegebenen Umständen völlig berechtigt ist. Wenn ein Staat so effizient die Pressefreiheit abschafft und eine Propagandawirklichkeit einführt, dann darf ein kritischer Journalist nichts anderes tun. 

Und natürlich hört es sich dann doof an, wenn der britische Regierungschef kein ""angeblich"" für jede Aussage bekommt. Er hatte ja damals gelogen, was die Massenvernichtungswaffen im Irak angeht. Vergessen wird dabei, wie die BBC ihn dafür fertig gemacht hat. Und die englische Öffentlichkeit hat Blair dank dieser Aufklärung nie verziehen, dass er das Land in den Irakkrieg geschleift hat. Blair ist bei den Briten wegen der Irak-Toten ziemlich unten durch. Putin hat solche Probleme natürlich nicht. 

Ein wirklich erhellender Beitrag. Danke, Danke. Jetzt verstehe ich die ganze Aufregung viel besser. Ich hatte immer befürchtet, dass Putin deshalb so populär ist, weil er militärisch so potent ist. Was wir Deutschen ja nicht sein dürfen. Also eine Art nationalistisches Ventil. Diese wesentlich gemäßigtere Interpretation, dass die Leute einfach Putins Propaganda auf den Leim gehen, ist mir wesentlich angenehmer. Und dass sie (vollkommen zu Recht übrigens) viele außenpolitische Doppelmoral-Finten der EU-Länder ablehnen.

Lustig wie du keine Argumente findest und dann anführst, dass Ich meine Posts wegen Rechtschreibung und Formulierung nacheditiere, ohne dass es Auswirkungen auf die Diskussion hat. 

Das mache ich immer, weil ich beim zweiten Mal lesen *immer* Rechtschreib und Satzbaufehler finde. Das nachträgliche ""Edit: Grammar""-Gespamme ist imho lächerlich unnötig.

Übrigens: Kant war schon in meiner ersten Antwort drinne, und das selbstverständlich auch in der ""ersten Fassung"". Du hast sogar drauf geantwortet.

Mettre en images sa fiche Wikipédia ?

Perpétuer les mythes qui se sont créés autour de lui (aussi bien légende noire que légende dorée), parce qu'on ne doit pas écorner le mythe et que c'est ce que le public attend ?

Et je suis assez énervé par la tendance de décerner des Oscars aux acteurs de biopic pour leur ""extraordinaire performance physique"", alors qu'ils se sont souvent contentés d'avoir un bon maquillage et de reproduire par pur mimétisme un tic du visage ou un accent. 

Le potentiel dramatique des biopics est faible. Cela donne lieu soit à un objet cinématographique très académique et convenu, soit à un mélo dégoulinant. 

Mais je suis d'accord que Sfar s'est plutôt bien débrouillé, puisqu'il a proposé son Gainsbourg à lui, de manière tellement personnelle qu'on l'a forcé à sous-titrer *Gainsbourg (Vie Heroique)* par **un conte de Joann Sfar** sur l'affiche du film.

Aucun biopic que j'ai vu ne m'a vraiment enthousiasmé. Je pense à *La Chute*, mas ce n'est pas vraiment un biopic, car décrivant un moment bien précis et tout à fait fascinant de la vie d'Adolf Hitler. Un film qui arrive miraculeusement à conjuguer rigueur historique et intensité dramatique, parce qu'il ne dilue pas son message en tentant de raconter toute la vie du dictateur allemand.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt;Do I finish all of my food to show that I loved it, or leave a tiny bit to show that what they gave was plenty?

Try to clear your plate, it's generally considered impolite to leave food on the plate. With that said, the problem is that it's difficult to try to limit your portions since people (especially older women) may physically try to stuff your plate, especially if you venture into the countryside. 

&gt;Should I ask for things directly or talk my way around it? 
I'm not sure what you mean about asking for things directly. 

This obviously depends on the context, but in general I would say that in this regard customs aren't really that different in Moldova compared to the rest of Europe. In general being more direct makes it more likely to get what you want, so that's the approach I usually take. 

&gt;Should I dress modest even in the heat or will it be acceptable to wear shorts?

Again this clearly depends on the setting, but I would say by and large Moldovans like to dress up more often than is the case in civilized countries. Now of course, ""dressing up"" may be a bit misleading since Moldovans have a horrible sense of fashion, but they at least make an effort. In general if you're expected to be dressed nice/decently nice shorts are a no-no. For men these are considered too gay and/or uncultured. Real Moldovan men dress in the tightest shirts/T-shirts available and skinny jeans to show off their bird-like physique. If you're a woman, than shorts are again considered unladylike and are hence inappropriate. The garb of a true lady in Moldova consists of Turkish knock-offs of cheap Italian dresses or semi-dressy pants. 

&gt;The last thing I want to do is come across as ungrateful or be a hassle, so any advice or thoughts even somewhat relevant would be lovely.

A good way of always being welcome wherever you go is to always bring alcohol with you. Go to a market, buy a six pack of 1.5L water bottles, dump the water out and fill it with wine from the peasants who sell it. In many cases you may not even need to secure the bottles beforehand as the peasants will usually have recycled water bottles of their own in which to package the wine.

&gt;In May 2013 Snowden took a leave of absence, telling his supervisors he was returning to the mainland for epilepsy treatment, but instead left Hawaii for Hong Kong where he arrived on May 20. WikiLeaks reported that he was seeking asylum in Iceland because of the country's ""shared values."" Iceland's ambassador to China said Icelandic law requires that asylum applications be made from within Iceland. Snowden explained why he did not go directly from the U.S. to Iceland: ""Leaving the US was an incredible risk, NSA employees must declare their foreign travel 30 days in advance and are monitored. There was a distinct possibility I would be interdicted en route, so I had to travel with no advance booking to a country with the cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained. Hong Kong provided that.

Ukraine is a complicated country. It's essentially two countries mashed into one with very distinct political alignments and so on. One side wants Russia, the other wants Europe.

The EU tells Ukraine that it can't have both. It can't sign any agreement with the EU and then do the same with Russia. Which is justified, it makes things difficult for EU to work with Ukraine if Ukraine also has to mind its agreements with Russia. 

But the thing is, Ukraine is divided. It was poor political maneuvering, not malicious, but the Ukr. Gov got forced to make a decision, either of which pissed off half of the country. Lose-lose. And here we are.

So, it's not that the EU intentionally exerted its influence to create this problem. In fact, I do honestly think they realized precisely where the fucked up when they sent the three Foreign Ministers to negotiate, but the fact is European, Western, interests, created a situation whereby there was going to be political unrest in Ukraine, due to its inherent conflict with Russian interests.

Weil Du Nicht Da Bist Songtext

Auf dem Gerüst vor unserem Fenster
Kommt kein Maurer mehr vorbei
Das Bett wird immer größer
Und das Bad ist immer frei
Der blöde Hund,
der mich sonst jeden Tag verbellt
Liegt nur noch stumpf im Gras
Und glotzt mit leeren Augen in die Welt
Weil du nicht da bist

Ein Vogel, der nur Körner frißt
macht Regenwürmer kalt
Im Bus, der nur noch stündlich kommt
sind alle angeschnallt
Die alte Frau, die mich sonst jeden Morgen grüßt
Kennt mich nicht mehr und tut,
als ob sie Groschenhefte liest
Weil du nicht da bist

Vom Nachbarn kommt Musik
Nach der schon lang kein Hahn mehr kräht
Eine Maus holt sich ihr Nachtmahl
Und auf meinem Nachttisch steht ein Schokoladenhase
Traurig und allein
Ich weiß ihm nicht zu helfen
Und stopf' ihn in mich hinein
Weil du nicht da bist

""I had to travel with no advance booking to a country with the cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained. Hong Kong provided that. Iceland could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current US administration.""

&gt;He also could have flown to the US, crossed the border into Mexico on foot or by car, and gone anywhere he'd like to.

As he explained on the above quote, he needed a place that wouldn't fold instantly after the source of the leaks came public. Mexico couldn't offer that. And he couldn't have gotten out of Mexico without crossing borders, meaning he would have been trapped there till they found him. You remember that not only did Hong Kong allow him to stay there for weeks, they even played time to allow him time to leave Hong Kong.

&gt; He arrived in China and immediately started granting interviews to Chinese papers and telling them about US efforts to monitor sensitive locations within China.[1] 

That's published 22.6.13. He had arrived to Hong Kong over month before and this interview was granted after he had haddone his bit with Greenward and others and given over the hard drives. He had also published his name with that video tape the day before.

At this point he was doing everything he could to make a household name for himself and granted interviews to speed it up. Chinese papers are naturally on the top because they had (1.) reporters close at hand and (2.) Snowden needed sympathy from the local politicians and population. 

Also, why do you keep saying ""China"" as to suggest that Snowden was on the mainlaind? Hong Kong has autonomy and representative democracy. I'm sure you don't refer visits to Greenland as ""going to Denmark"". 

&gt;That has nothing to do whatsoever with protecting the 4th amendment rights of US citizens, which he claimed was his motivation.

""I really want the focus to be on these documents and the debate which I hope this will trigger among citizens around the globe about what kind of world we want to live in."" He added: ""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them."" [Link](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance)

(1.) The fourth amendment doesn't talk of US citizens but of all people that come to contact with US government.

(2a.) At no point does Snowden claim he is doing this solely for US citizens.

(2b.) The quote specially says that he wants to change the way the world works, not just exclude US government from some particular technique. 

&gt; He had a long time to think about where he wanted to end up.

Yeah. That would have been Iceland, as said above. But to be safe there he needed to drum up support first. Alas, for some reason his passport was cancelled and the only country that promised to take him in was Russia.

&gt;It's no coincidence he ran to America's two largest enemies, who also happen to be two of the biggest human rights violators in the world.

(1.) Human rights in Hong Kong: ""In general, Hong Kong is perceived to enjoy a high level of civil liberties. The Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of the citizens, although core issues remain. There are concerns over the freedom of assembly which is restricted by the Public Order Ordinance. The police has been occasionally accused of using heavy-handed tactics towards protestors and questions are asked towards the extensive powers of the police."" [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Hong_Kong). 

Sound pretty good to me, particularly if calibrate our moral compass with the country that really screwed the Occupy-protests, did the ""Free Speech Zones"", the highest number of prisoners per capita and Guantanamo Bay. 

(2a.) For China: ""Greatest enemy"" is rather big word to be used for your second biggest trade partner and a big holder of your public dept. 

(2b.) Last summer Russia was just one regional power among many. Sure, the relationship was riggidy, but hardly in a state of Cold War. Moscow hadn't made any threads about nuking USA. Heck, your whole space strategy hinged on Russian co-operation. That's not a ""greatest enemy"". 

And again, Russia wasn't the first choice. He kept speaking of Europe and Iceland until he had to get to somewhere and only one country stepped up.

&gt; two of the biggest human rights violators in the world.

The US is investigating Google for breaking anti-trust regulations. Given Google's history of being fined, I'm not sure I agree it has created a ""superstate"" where anti-trust regulations dont apply.

&gt;With the exception of biological viruses, there is nothing with such speed, efficiency and aggressiveness that spreads like these technology platforms, and this also lends its creators, owners and users with new power.

And on that note, why does he not start his own ""technology platform"". He is in a much better position than 99.999% of the world's population. If ""technology platforms"" spread so quickly, efficiently, and aggressively his company should be more diversified in ""technology platforms"" instead of dying media.

I was thinking about moving to Madrid and find a job there, but honestly, moving to a foreign country and starting from zero on your own is very difficult. Even more if you don't know the language. So instead, I looked for a job as an au-pair, wrote some presentation letters and posted on several websites, and within 2 weeks found a family that was willing to take me in for the year. We skyped a lot before my departure, so I got to know the parents and the kids and start a relationship with them before setting foot in Spain. Knowing I would have people there for me on day one was truly relieving.

I took a plane in september and as soon as I got there, I was imediately adopted by the family. Everything went great! I lived with them, took spanish classes during the day with the money I had saved, and took care of the kids in the evenings and on the weekends. Seriously, that year was one of the most fun and rich experiences I've had in my life. And it was way easier than I thought. I'm so glad that we're in the EU, we don't need any visa, you just go there with your ID and that's all you need!

Putin is most definitely not suicidal and there is absolutely zero way he lives through any nuclear exchange Russia initiates.  America will systemically drop Minutemen IIIs on any rock that the fucker who launched on us might be hiding under.  Putin throws away all his power the minute the launch order goes.

I don't really see Russia wanting to take this hot.  If Europe starts to look too risky, Russia will go engage in border fuckery in Central Asia or elsewhere and the Russian news will switch to focusing on that poor oppressed Russian population/rebuilding the USSR by getting the Central Asian 'stans back.  Or else they'll sulk and blame the warmongering American bastards for all their ills in the world.

American actions legitimize shadow wars, whereas Russia's actions legitimize real wars.

Ryanair? Well, no it wasn't their fault.

Ultimately: my fault! Should have given myself more time. Also, I should have had travel insurance.

So what did I learn? Get travel insurance.

In DB's defence, I once missed a DB train due to an NS cancellation and DB refunded the ticket, even though they were not at fault.

Edit: I guess I'll actually try and give some advice. Be nice to Lufthansa and they may try and help you out. When I missed my Ryanair flight i was charged a ""missed flight"" fee to get on the next flight. It was 100€, but it was still cheaper than buying a new ticket.

Seriously though, moving to a different country and finding both job and home is far from easy. You don't even have the (relative) benefit of a similar currency, so you'd have to keep an eye on the euro-krona exchange rates at first, until local money started coming in.

You won't need any ID beyond your passport or national ID to stay for a long time, though, so there's that - Sweden's in the Schengen area.

I strongly, **STRONGLY** advise against moving and then trying to find a job locally. Job **must** come first, the rest will follow. When renting a place, for instance, any landlord will want to at least see a job contract (and a bunch of other things, let me tell you) before they let you move in.

What /u/1044 said is a good bet, being an au pair will probably help. If you're looking for something else, hit up both the Swedish consulate in Paris and the French consulate in Stockholm. You're also lucky in that Paris is the only place outside of Sweden where the Svenska Institutet maintains a cultural center. They would be another place to look, either for a job or advice to move in.

Finally, I know in France a bunch of companies have international internship/summer job programs, where you apply at the HQ in France and get sent to work for a short time in one of the subsidiaries elsewhere. There's a bunch of Swedish companies operating in France, so you could look them up: Ikea, Saab, Atlas Copco, Trelleborg AB, Tetra Pak, Volvo, Electrolux...

Parlando di prezzi del solo ricevimento (immagino che le altre spese come abiti/fedi/inviti/auto etc siano simili tra nord e sud), il mio matrimonio costerà 145€ a persona, ed al momento abbiamo circa 200 invitati. 145€ sono un prezzo assolutamente nella media da noi per un ricevimento che include buffet di antipasti, 2 primi, 2 secondi e buffet di frutta e dolci finale. Considerando che circa 20% degli invitati statisticamente verrà meno, immagino saranno 160 confermati. 145€ x 160 = 23.200€ il costo del ristorante.

But people report the same thing just about everywhere, including big cities, so there's something else going on as well. I had a client who ran a relocation agency, and I asked her specifically why Americans always feel ""stared at"" wherever they go in Germany. She said that Germans simply maintain eye contact for a split second longer than Americans are comfortable with. As a result, Americans feel Germans are always staring at them, while Germans get the impression that Americans avoid eye contact. In reality, it's a matter of a fraction of a second, but it's enough for you to notice subconsciously.

On lui donne une voiture télécommandée et les autres des poupées. Elle a eu un gâteau d'anniversaire rose et un autre avec Scooby Doo.

Par contre il y a des trucs dans les vêtements où tu peux pas trop. Les robes, c'est féminin, ça peut faire joli sans faire gnan-gnan, du coup j'achète des robes mais pas que du rose. Je les lui mets juste pas quand ça pourraît entraver ses mouvements quand elle joue, donc plutôt le week-end ou pour des occasions. Les pantoufles pour l'école, c'est hello kitty parce qu'il y a presque que ça qui est pas trop dégueu (l'alternative c'est des trucs Cars ou avec des chiens, on s'en lasse aussi). Elle réclame tous les trucs roses horribles et pailletés et on fait un tri pour éviter que ça devienne extrême. Chez H&amp;M t'es presque obligé d'aller chez les garçons pour du neutre, mais même chez eux ça devient hyper-sexualisé dans le sens macho, avec des énormes logos ou images de dessins animés. Mais chez Verbaudet ou Cyrillus ou Zara, ça va.

Le truc c'est qu'il y a quand même des gens qui s'en rendent compte de ça, par exemple on a trouvé un costume de femme pirate qui incluait une robe et aussi un sabre et un patch pour l'oeil, c'était parfait. On peut aussi choisir ses livres. En plus elle aime bien les trucs comme Ben 10 et on l'encourage à s'identifier au héros et pas au perso féminin (même si en l'occurrence c'est pas un mauvais modèle). La Barbie qu'elle a c'est celle qui fait informaticienne, et la maîtresse d'école. On encourage le vélo et quand on la mettra au sport on essaiera de pas faire que du ballet...

And contraception methods are a great way of preventing abortions. 

I think in Switzerland we have a rather sensible way of dealing with abortions. Here abortions are legal into the 12th week, after that an abortion may only be done if the life of the mother is at (high) risk. Through this abortions can be conducted in a save environment, the mother can be properly informed of the dangers and the alternatives, the abortion is covered by basic insurance removing financial problems from the equation. 

Abortions rates are on decline in Switzerland and some of the lowest in the world, which I believe shows that we have found a good solution. The solution has also strong support in the population as votes have shown in the past ten years.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"Just for the record, here's Putin's views on gas (and oil) from the [transcript](http://eng.kremlin.ru/transcripts/7034):

&gt; MARIA SITTEL: More from anxious pensioners. “If the West refuses to purchase gas from Russia, how will that affect people’s well-being, especially that of pensioners?” –  Lyudmila Budarina, Tambov Region.
&gt;
VLADIMIR PUTIN: I have to say that oil and gas revenues make up a large part of the Russian budget revenue. This is a serious component for us in addressing economic development, budget funding for our development programmes and, of course, and meeting of our social commitments to our citizens.
&gt;
I’ll tell you what. I am not sure that I’ll get the figures right, but, if my memory serves me correctly, the bulk of oil and gas revenue comes not from gas but from oil. In terms of the dollar equivalent, our oil revenues last year amounted to $191-194 billion and gas revenues to about $28 billion. See the difference? 191 from oil and 28 from gas.
&gt;
Oil is sold on world markets. Is there any way to do us harm? One may try. But what would be the result for those who would attempt to do it? First of all, how would this be done? Of all the countries in the world, only Saudi Arabia has the real potential to increase production and thus bring down world prices. Saudi Arabia’s budget assumes a price of $85-$90 per thousand cubic metres.
&gt;
KIRILL KLEYMENOV: President Obama has already visited them.
&gt;
VLADIMIR PUTIN: I’m sorry, I meant oil, not gas. The budget assumes a price of $85-$90 per barrel, and our budget, I think, $90. So, if one goes below $85, Saudi Arabia will be on the losing end and have problems. For us a drop from $90 to $85 is not critical. That is first.
&gt;
Second, we are on very good terms with Saudi Arabia. We may, for example, differ in terms of our views on Syria, but we practically have identical positions on the development of the situation in Egypt. There are many other things where we see eye-to-eye.
&gt;
I have great respect for the custodian of the two Muslim shrines, the King of Saudi Arabia. He is a very clever and balanced man. I don’t think that our Saudi friends would make any abrupt changes to harm themselves and the Russian economy.
&gt;
Furthermore, they are members of OPEC, where we have many supporters. It is not that they have sympathy for us, but that they have their own economic interests and sharply reducing production – which can only be done in a manner agreed upon within OPEC – is a fairly complicated business.
&gt;
Finally, in the United States, which is developing shale gas and shale oil production, production costs are very high. These are expensive projects. If world prices tumble, these projects may turn out to be unprofitable, loss-making and the nascent industry may simply die.
&gt;
And one last point. Oil is priced and traded in the world in dollars. If prices fall, demand for dollars will plummet and the dollar will start losing its significance as a world currency. There are very many factors involved. The wish to bite us is there, but the opportunities are limited. That said, some damage can be caused.
&gt;
Now about gas. We sell gas by pipeline (most of our sales are by pipeline) mainly to the European countries that depend on Russian supplies to cover about 30-35, 34 percent of their needs. Can they stop buying Russian gas altogether? I don’t think that this is possible.
&gt;
Some of our neighbours, very good neighbours with which we have very sound relations, such as, for example, Finland…Finland gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia. Some countries that used to be called People’s Democracies in Eastern Europe depend on Russian gas if not for 90 percent, then for 60, 50 or 70 percent of their needs.
&gt;
Can supplies be stopped altogether? I think that this is totally unrealistic. But one can do this at one’s own cost, by hurting oneself. However, I cannot imagine such a situation. Therefore, of course, everyone is keen on diversifying their sources of supplies. Europe is talking about greater independence from Russia as a supplier, and similarly we are beginning to talk and act to become less dependent on our consumers.
&gt;
However, so far, there is a measure of balance between consumers and suppliers. The only problem is transit countries. And the most dangerous part, of course, is transit via Ukraine with which we have tremendous difficulties in agreeing on energy problems. But I hope that we will be able to bring things back to normal, considering the contracts that have been signed and are functioning.

EDIT: Putin is wrong when implying it's not possible for Finland to do without Russian gas. Finland is not dependend on Russian gas. 

While Finland currently gets 100% of its natural gas from Russia, gas is only about 10% of all primary energy usage. It's used in some power plants producing electricity and district heat. If the gas was suddenly cut those powerplants would switch to other sources of energy (air-propane mix, biogas, oil, coal etc) or get compensated by other powerplants. In Finland there are [existing plans](http://www.huoltovarmuus.fi/static/pdf/607.pdf) for such case to arise, and legislation requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time. The [National Emergency Supply Agency](http://www.nesa.fi/) is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution.

So basically Finland *could* do without Russian gas. In case of sudden closure of Russian gas pipes no-one would freeze, no-one would die, steel making would not halt as it doesn't use gas, but there would be some costs in switching over to other energy sources in affected power plants.

There are plans and proposals for a more heterogenous gas supply such as the new LNG terminal with Estonia, the proposed Mid-Nordic Gas Pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland, the Nordic Gas Grid and the North TransGas Project. But all those would be years away.",0,1397815204,null,0,1397817270,0,cgvmeay,t3_23bx16,t1_cgvmeay,t3_23bx16,null,1433410136,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

&gt; Not respecting NATO commitments would utterly destroy all credibility that the US has in the international sphere, and would likely take the economy, which would cause a negative spiral throughout the West. While not as bad as a nuclear war, this option is still pretty bad.

I get the credibility point, which is NATO's strongest suite right now. Article V has never been tested, and therefore it can be argued that it's been successful. But as soon as it's tested a single time and NATO doesn't uphold Article V, then NATO is dealt an enormous blow, and its credibility disintegrates. But my question is how would not respecting NATO commitments lead to the West's economy tanking?

Now i don't completely rule out on  companies not  willing to hire PhD's though,  but if they do then they would be shelling out a hell load of money (Hiring a PhD is expensive). And most of the positions are as a Scientist at the project management level, for which one needs to be exceptional at management skills ( which again most PhD's are not used to :)).

Normally, a good Masters degree with work experience ( in the form of Praktikum, traineeship or experience in the field ) would suffice.

J'ai beaucoup aimé la série Daria à l'époque, ce n'est que plus tard que j'ai réalisé que c'était notamment à cause des personnages féminins intéressants et étoffés, et donc de la perspective nouelles qu'ils offraient. Un des problèmes avec la promotion des modèles (*role models*) féminins chez les enfants et les ados c'est que la pression sociale est très forte pour décourager les garçons de s'intéresser aux ""trucs de filles"". Etant curieux, quand j'étais gamin j'ai voulu une fois ou deux jouer à la poupée avec les filles ou enfiler une bague fantaisie, mais adultes et enfants m'ont très vite fait comprendre que ce n'était pas mais alors pas du tout acceptable.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Cheaper credit does not automatically produce a bubble. It's necessary for the government concerned to treat the cheaper credit as a consequence-free money tree for that to happen.

Irish governments responded to the availability of cheap credit by creating a mass of tax breaks for property development and property purchase, which had the effect of helping divert the cheap credit into the creation of a housing bubble. They did nothing to try to divert that credit towards building or expanding indigenous businesses - instead, they created conditions where most Irish SMEs bought into the property market, and are now burdened by negative equity.

Cheap credit is not a bad thing in itself. It becomes a bad thing when policy responses are inappropriate, as the certainly were in Ireland. What's required is for a responsible electorate to elect governments with marginally more control than a two year old faced with a pile of sweets.

As to where the money actually comes from - there's a popular myth that banks lend you other people's money, and that therefore the money being lent out into the Irish bubble ""must have come from somewhere"". This isn't what actually happens - banks create money by lending, and Irish banks created most of the money they pumped into the bubble because they saw big profits in doing so, and we didn't have a regulatory regime that slowed them down, let alone stopped them.

You can't put them in the densely populated areas where they would be the most useful, because even a minor accident that just requires the permanent evacuation of the surrounding area would dislocate millions of people and be a major economic blow.

Especially in Spain it's a total no-brainer to go for renewables. You've got empty, dry stretches of land that aren't being used otherwise.

People seem to think that the causes of the Eurocrisis are solely the fault of those countries which received bailouts; Primarily Greece and Ireland. What people seem to forget that for each irresponsible borrower there is also an irresponsible lender.

What people don't know is that it was *German* banks doing the lending, *German* banks had the highest amount of assets in Ireland, and the second highest in Greece and Spain. 

On top of that, during the years prior to the Eurocrisis, Germany was enjoying a very hefty surplus at the expense of the rest of the Eurozone's export industries. It stimulated no domestic demand and it out muscled everybody else in intra-Eurozone exports. So while Germany was benefiting from all those exports, it was doing so at the expense of those countries which it would be later bailing out.

It was *Germany* that torpedoed the Stability &amp; Growth Pact, which would have prevented this whole mess in the first place, and massively undermined the Maastricht Treaty, which removed all pressure for any kind of fiscal responsibility from Eurozone states. *Germany* broke the fiscal rules before any of us.

All I'm saying is that there's definitely more than one party at fault here. When we fell over we expected Germany to pick us up, not break our legs, give us a wheel chair then tell us we should be thankful for the service.

The loans we've been given are nothing short of humiliating, and Greece has it far worse. Neither of us have improved at all in the years since we were bailed out and all the austerity policies have done for us have dramatically reduced our quality of life.

When we talk about the European Union, we're meant to share the prosperity when things are great, and then share the burden when things go bad. Instead of sharing the burden, Germany acted entirely out of self-preservation as opposed to any benevolence, and still haven't recognized their own responsibilities in the lead up to the crisis nor their own poor decisions during it.

&gt; Elle ne peuvent pas survivre non plus sans les innovations, les matières premières, les marchés de l'étranger. Sauf à rester dans un aquarium clos et là je rigole grave.

En quoi est-ce qu'établir un contrôle des mouvements de capitaux empêcherait l'innovation, la procuration de matères premières ou l'accès aux marchés étrangers s'il est auorisé dans l'intérêt des Français ? Pour rappel, les pays qui s'en sortent bien aujourd'hui contrôlent ces mouvements, vient-ils dans un aquarium pour autant ?

&gt; Oui, c'est uniquement l'Europe qui a créé la croissance chinoise. Arrêtons la fumette. SVP

Non, l'oligarchie étatst-unienne a aussi réussi à envoyer l'industrie de l'autre côté du Pacifique par exemple. L'euro est un facteur aggravant puisque les produits fabriqués en zone dollar coûtent moins cher qu'en zone euro. Trop facile de dire ensuite que les Français ne demandent pas de produits français.

&gt; Non, ce n'est pas le commissaire européen qui décide seul. Il écoute ( en fait obéit ) les recommendations du Conseil Européen : La commission et l'Europe sont un échelon de tractation pour la France. Ce que j'ai dit exactement. Je vois que la désinformation@latroïka a bien focntionné. 

Et la France doit se battre dans le Conseil européen contre des pays qui ne partagent pas ses intérêts. 

&gt; On peut quand même se demander pourquoi personne n'écoute la France ?

Parce que le reste de l'UE ne partage pas les intérêts de la France, ça n'a rien à voir avec sa prétendue nullité. On voit que le French bashing  a fait son boulot.

&gt; Enfin, c'est normal ? Les subventions viendraient d'où sinon ? De mon c.. ? C'était un exemple. 

Exemple qui tombe à l'eau alors, puisque ça montre que les aides que reçoivent les agriculteurs français sont en fait des aides qui viennent des Français eux-même ; on estampille le drapeau bleu aux étoiles d'or pour faire croire que ça vient de l'UE. Nous n'avons donc pas besoin de l'UE sur ce point, et nous pourrons d'ailleurs les aider d'avantage.

&gt; Pas que le textile soit foncièrement important pour l'économie française. 

Va dire ça aux Vosgiens. Ca marchait bien avant, pourquoi changer cela ? Parce que les bénéfices engendrés par le différentiel des coûts de production partiront dans la poche des multi-millionaires, dont le nombre a explosé ces dernières années. Bravo la libre circulation des capitaux !

&gt; En s'adaptant, en profitant des innovations qui ne sont pas faites chez nous, en exportant, en important et en produisant. D'autres questions ?

Et tout ceci peut se faire sans l'UE. 

&gt; De Gaulle est un menteur et un mégalo, ça tombe bien on a eu quasiment que ça dans la Ve qui est bien à son image. La France n'a jamais quitté l'OTAN, la France n'a pas laissé entrer le RU par altruisme, on y a beaucoup gagné notamment sur notre programme nucléaire qui avait du mal à décoller. On était complètement en position de force avec le RU qui crevait la gueule ouverte en dehors du marché européen ( la preuve qu'il est indispensable et qu'on se tirerait une balle dans le pied en le quittant ). Si 40 ans après, on s'en mord les doigts, c'est notre faute d'être incapable de jouer une main gagnante. 

De Gaulle n'a effectivement pas assuré sa succession, ni sû analyser les changements sociétaux, ni prévoir la véritable piège qu'est l'UE.
Je ne vois pas le rapport avec l'OTAN, et c'est Pompidou qui a fait rentrer le RU, ce qui est une trahison totale du Général. Je ne vois pas en quoi est-ce que son entrée (en 1973) aurait fait décoller notre programme nucléaire puisque la première bombe H française date de 1968. 

Pour le marché européen, je te laisse méditer cet échange entre De Gaulle et Peyrefitte :

Alain Peyrefitte : – Est-ce que nous pourrons changer de fusil d’épaule ? »

Charles de Gaulle : – Mais bien sûr ! Croyez-vous que nous ayons besoin du Marché commun pour respirer ? En face de la manœuvre des Anglais, des Américains et des Allemands, notre manœuvre à nous ce sera de dire : « la fin du Marché commun, ça ne nous contrarie pas.»
« Je n’avais pas été favorable à l’intégration européenne. Mais dès lors qu’on avait signé le traité de Rome, j’ai pensé, quand je suis arrivé aux affaires, qu’il fallait qu’on l’applique. S’il n’est pas appliqué, la France s’en tirera très bien autrement. »

Alain Peyrefitte : - Il y a une conviction répandue dans les esprits, surtout dans la jeunesse, c’est que, sans l’Europe, la France ne sera plus rien ».

Charles de Gaulle : – Il est possible que la fin du Marché commun, ce soit justement la fin de ce mythe. Ce serait heureux : il a été forgé par les fumistes qui ont voulu faire croire à l’Europe supranationale. [...] Nous avons voulu faire une politique d’entente avec les Allemands. Si les Allemands nous glissent entre les doigts, eh bien, nous avons les moyens de nous retourner !

**Le monde est vaste et la France a un grand jeu à jouer. »**

&gt; Non, c'est surtout de dire ""C'est la faute à l'Europe"" alors que l'alternative dans le cas d'Arcelor était de spolier les actionnaires. 

Je te montre qu'il est illégal de faire du protectionnisme en vertu des traités européens. Si Obama bloque l'achat d'éoliennes sur le sol américain par des entreprises chinoises, c'est parce qu'il n'en est pas empêché par des traités.

&gt; L'entreprise étant franco-luxembourgeoise, les intérêts n'étaient pas divergents. Donc 1) tu ne lis pas 2) tu tournes à vide. 

Un peu de sérieux,  les différents Etats-membres n'ont pas les mêmes intérêts et avec l'euro, tout ça mène à un feu d'artifice général. Réponds à ces questions : comment pourrait-il y avoir une harmonisation fiscale quand le Luxembourg n'a pas d'industrie à défendre ? Pourquoi l'Allemagne accepterait-elle de faire baisser le taux de change externe de l'euro alors qu'elle enregistre des excédents commerciaux exorbitants ? Pourquoi les pays de l'Europe de l'Est accepteraient-ils de monter les salaires alors qu'ils fouteraient ainsi en l'air leur competitivité vis-à-vis de nous ? Pourquoi les Français devraient-ils accepter des salaires plus bas et abandonner le service public fort auxquels ils sont attachés ? Pouquoi les Pays-Bas accepteraient-ils de remettre en cause l'article 63, sachant qu'ils n'ont pas du tout le même avis que nous sur le libre-échange ?",0,1397822846,null,0,1397823553,0,cgvnp30,t3_2360io,t1_cgvnp30,t1_cgv592z,null,1433410815,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

Obviously a simple mistake people make is that people are willing to lose money to Greece. The thing is, more money is to be made by giving Greece bad conditions for loaning.

In any case, having your own currency allows you to devalue it, unlike a common currency like euro. This means in practice that you can sell resources at a lower cost and therefore export more. There is a reason why we have three different kinds of kronor in scandinavia.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Yep, but pumping fluid into the ground to crack rocks and release gas is a hard to predict process. A new generation nuclear reactor on the other hand is. People's drinking water has already been poisoned - they can set light to it and there has already been a minor earthquake caused by it. Also I'll make the point that fracking is a very very new technology, and like when nuclear was a very new technology, much more potentially unpredictable and likely to go wrong. Frankly, fracking is being lobbied to hell by those whose pockets will be lined by it way before adequate studies into how it can affect things. There really is concerning lack of concern by those pushing it, into how it can affect the enviroment. I'm sure it can be done safely, but I highly doubt they will ignore sites where it can be a possibility - they haven't already. Forgive me for not trusting in the motives of those doing the fracking.

Well, to me that looks like promoting a very vague set of fears in a similar manner as is often done regarding nuclear power. See how easy it is:  
*""Yep, but storing highly radioactive nuclear waste in underground tunnels is a hard to predict process. A new generation solar panels on the other hand is.

Do not look like very convincing arguments to me. While I'm sure nuclear industry and hydraulic fracturing both have examples which deserve critisism for their failures, I do not apply that wholesale to all of it because that would be disingenious. A failure in Chernobyl is not a failure of all nuclear industry, and a failure in Virginia is not a failure of fracking everywhere else.
