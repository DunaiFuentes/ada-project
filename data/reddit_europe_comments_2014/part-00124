Not legally. But in theory, it's also not possible to come in France without having any resource, therefore Roma people are there illegally.

true,Shtroumffarceur,EURO,European Union,"It's more complicated, really. 

In a democracy, citizens have rights and duties. They are supposed to be under the country's protection. They pay taxes, they have access to state funded infrastructures, they receive allocations; you name it. A citizen is part of an organized society that has an influence on the nation's culture and its territory. In exchange, and according to local constitutions, citizens have to respect the law and do their part for the country, which goes from civic duties to conscription. I'm simplifying but you get the idea. 

I see your point when you say conscription is slavery. But you have to ask yourself the question, do you want your state to force its citizens to defend their country's independence and protect it self against enemy invaders or do you just want to live a life where any belligerent country can take arms against you and just do whatever they want?

It's up to the executive and legislative bodies to decide whether or not it is needed but I think there are at least two main reasons to justify the need of a conscription army. Either the country is under an imminent threat from direct neighbors and doesn't have any nuclear deterrent. Or it is at war and the whole territorial integrity is at stake. 

Of course, in an ideal world, I would prefer not having to be forced to take arms against anyone. I live in a country where I don't feel my whole way of living is being threatened so it is easier to think that conscription is useless (which is why I'm glad it was abolished in France). In time of peace and prosperity a country can easily move toward having a small and efficient professional army or even decide it doesn't need one. But that choice inevitably depends on the neighboring countries. It's all well and good to condemn conscriptions but that won't mean shit for the nation that decided to invade yours. 


So yeah, my point is, slavery or not, I understand why Ukraine would reinstate the conscription (which was only abolished in 2013, according to wikipedia). Is it democratic? Does the interim government is legitimate enough to make this kind of decision? I don't know but to me, it makes sense.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; What kind of disclosure can be avoided in the EU? It surprises me somewhat that Japan has not granted equivalence to the EU, but this might be because the EU has not granted equivalence to Japan?

You can structure offerings based on size, number of shares, frequency, etc. to avoid most disclosure. Japan evaluated both models, and did not want to expose its markets to potentially risky securities. It still allows cross-listing, but each listing has to be submitted and approved by Japanese regulators. 

&gt;Without HTF, there might also have been large sell-offs though, perhaps slightly slower? And sell-offs of themselves are not really harmful: sell-offs are an inherent risk for all markets. Also, without HTF, there would be reduced liquidity and this would have a pricing impact.

Personally I'm not against HFT in general. I think things like server colocation (leasing server space in the NYSE, CBOT, etc. data centers) should not be allowed. It gives HFT traders that can afford the $60k per month an advantage that isn't open to everyone. Of course you can make the argument that they would still compete, they would just be located across the street. Obviously this is a valid argument, but something seems wrong about the exchanges themselves leasing out server space. 

Valid point. I am not sure how all the disclosure laws work in the US or UK, so I have to admit that might be more sound than I was originally thinking. ",0,1398985128,null,0,false,0,ch79nmb,t3_24fsl4,t1_ch79nmb,t1_ch6yroi,null,1433611353,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Anekdote zur Senkung der Arbeitsmoral

In einem Hafen an einer westlichen Küste Europas liegt ein ärmlich gekleideter Mann in seinem Fischerboot und döst. Ein schick angezogener Tourist legt eben einen neuen Farbfilm in seinen Fotoapparat, um das idyllische Bild zu fotografieren: blauer Himmel, grüne See mit friedlichen, schneeweißen Wellenkämmen, schwarzes Boot, rote Fischermütze. Klick. Noch einmal: klick, und da aller guten Dinge drei sind und sicher sicher ist, ein drittes Mal: klick. Das spröde, fast feindselige Geräusch weckt den dösenden Fischer, der sich schläfrig aufrichtet, schläfrig nach seiner Zigarettenschachtel angelt. Aber bevor er das Gesuchte gefunden, hat ihm der eifrige Tourist schon eine Schachtel vor die Nase gehalten, ihm die Zigarette nicht gerade in den Mund gesteckt, aber in die Hand gelegt, und ein viertes Klick, das des Feuerzeuges, schließt die eilfertige Höflichkeit ab. Durch jenes kaum meßbare, nie nachweisbare zuviel an flinker Höflichkeit ist eine gereizte Verlegenheit entstanden, die der Tourist - der Landessprache mächtig - durch ein Gespräch zu überbrücken versucht. ""Sie werden heute einen guten Fang machen.""

Kopfschütteln des Fischers. ""Aber man hat mir gesagt, daß das Wetter günstig ist."" Kopfnicken des Fischers.

""Sie werden also nicht ausfahren?"" Kopfschütteln des Fischers, steigende Nervosität des Touristen. Gewiß liegt ihm das Wohl des ärmlich gekleideten Menschen am Herzen, nagt an ihm die Trauer über die verpaßte Gelegenheit. ""Oh? Sie fühlen sich nicht wohl?"" Endlich geht der Fischer von der Zeichensprache zum wahrhaft gesprochenen Wort über.

""Ich fühle mich großartig"", sagt er. ""Ich habe mich nie besser gefühlt."" Er steht auf, reckt sich, als wollte er demonstrieren, wie athletisch er gebaut ist. ""Ich fühle mich phantastisch.""

Der Gesichtsausdruck des Touristen wird immer unglücklicher, er kann die Frage nicht mehr unterdrücken, die ihm sozusagen das Herz zu sprengen droht: ""Aber warum fahren Sie dann nicht aus?"" Die Antwort kommt prompt und knapp.

""Weil ich heute morgen schon ausgefahren bin."" ""War der Fang gut?"" ""Er war so gut, daß ich nicht noch einmal ausfahren brauche, ich habe vier Hummer in meinen Körben gehabt, fast zwei Dutzend Makrelen gefangen.""

Der Fischer, endlich erwacht, taut jetzt auf und klopft dem Touristen auf die Schulter. Dessen besorgter Gesichtsausdruck erscheint ihm als ein Ausdruck zwar unangebrachter, doch rührender Kümmernis. ""Ich habe sogar für morgen und übermorgen genug!"" sagte er, um des Fremden Seele zu erleichtern. ""Rauchen Sie eine von meinen?""

""Ja, danke.""

Zigaretten werden in Münder gesteckt, ein fünftes Klick, der Fremde setzt sich kopfschüttelnd auf den Bootsrand, legt die Kamera aus der Hand, denn er braucht jetzt beide Hände, um seiner Rede Nachdruck zu verleihen. ""Ich will mich ja nicht in Ihre persönlichen Angelegenheiten mischen"", sagt er, ""aber stellen Sie sich mal vor, Sie führen heute ein zweites, ein drittes, vielleicht sogar ein viertes Mal aus, und Sie würden drei, vier, fünf, vielleicht sogar zehn Dutzend Makrelen fangen. Stellen Sie sich das mal vor!""

Der Fischer nickt.

""Sie würden"", fährt der Tourist fort, ""nicht nur heute, sondern morgen, übermorgen, ja, an jedem günstigen Tag zwei-, dreimal, vielleicht viermal ausfahren - wissen Sie, was geschehen würde?""
 

Der Fischer schüttelt den Kopf.

""Sie würden sich in spätestens einem Jahr einen Motor kaufen können, in zwei Jahren ein zweites Boot, in drei oder vier Jahren könnten Sie vielleicht einen kleinen Kutter haben, mit zwei Booten oder dem Kutter würden Sie natürlich viel mehr fangen - eines Tages würden Sie zwei Kutter haben, Sie würden..."", die Begeisterung verschlägt ihm für ein paar Augenblicke die Stimme, ""Sie würden ein kleines Kühlhaus bauen, vielleicht eine Räucherei, später eine Marinadenfabrik, mit einem eigenen Hubschrauber rundfliegen, die Fischschwärme ausmachen und Ihren Kuttern per Funk Anweisung geben, sie könnten die Lachsrechte erwerben, ein Fischrestaurant eröffnen, den Hummer ohne Zwischenhändler direkt nach Paris exportieren - und dann..."" - wieder verschlägt die Begeisterung dem Fremden die Sprache. Kopfschüttelnd, im tiefsten Herzen betrübt, seiner Urlaubsfreude schon fast verlustig, blickt er auf die friedlich hereinrollende Flut, in der die ungefangenen Fische munter springen. ""Und dann"", sagt er, aber wieder verschlägt ihm die Erregung die Sprache. Der Fischer klopft ihm auf den Rücken wie einem Kind, das sich verschluckt hat. ""Was dann?"" fragt er leise.

""Dann"", sagt der Fremde mit stiller Begeisterung, ""dann könnten Sie beruhigt hier im Hafen sitzen, in der Sonne dösen - und auf das herrliche Meer blicken.""

""Aber das tu ich ja schon jetzt"", sagt der Fischer, ""ich sitze beruhigt am Hafen und döse, nur Ihr Klicken hat mich dabei gestört."" Tatsächlich zog der solcherlei belehrte Tourist nachdenklich von dannen, denn früher hatte er auch einmal geglaubt, er arbeite, um eines Tages einmal nicht mehr arbeiten zu müssen, aber es blieb keine Spur von Mitleid mit dem ärmlich gekleideten Fischer in ihm zurück, nur ein wenig Neid.

the real problem of course is surveys are hugely limited by the use of words and phrases, certainly in English where almost everything is subjective.

&gt;I used to be an unapologetic racist(Believer in racial ideology, nationalism, the whole lot), and it's only because I got exposed to an extremely wide range of other streams of thought that I managed to get out of that rut. I know that if I was targeted for what I believed in at the time it would simply radicalize and solidify my thought process, no matter how flawed it really was.

And this is my point exactly. Exposure to other cultures is what seems to have the best effect on racism and other similar ideologies. Remember the white supremacist that found out he was Jewish, then went full Orthodox (a story was on here a while ago). 

I also think that punishing things like hate speech makes them a martyr. If a far right politician gets thrown in jail for hate speech, I only think it will rally their supporters rather than detract from any of the sentiment. It bars speech, *not* thoughts, so it doesn't really do anything to change perceptions. Personally I think it could even help ferment them because it reinforces the ""society is against us, just look at this!"" mentality.

&gt;Before the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, researchers who attempted to count the number of people killed under Stalin's regime produced estimates ranging from 3 to 60 million.[101] After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives also became available, containing official records of 799,455 executions 1921–53,[102] around 1.7 million deaths in the Gulag and some 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement – with a total of about 2.9 million officially recorded victims in these categories.[103]

Also very worrying is that...

&gt;Results of a controversial poll taken in 2006 stated that **over 35% of Russians would vote for Stalin** if he were still alive.[313][314] Fewer than a third of all Russians regarded Stalin as a ""murderous tyrant"";[8] however, a Russian court in 2009, ruling on a suit by Stalin's grandson, Yevgeny Dzhugashvili, against the newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, ruled that referring to Stalin as a ""bloodthirsty cannibal"" was not libel.[315] In a July 2007 poll **54% of the Russian youth agreed that Stalin did more good than bad** while 46% (of them) disagreed that Stalin was a ""cruel tyrant"". Half of the respondents, aged from 16 to 19, agreed Stalin was a wise leader.[9]

I have to disagree, those countries are imposing regulations on the trades of their securities that affect their economies. The only reason those trades are made in London is because the U.K does not want to play by the same rules (and they are perfectly entitled to). This law is simply fixing some loopholes. Nobody is forcing anyone to trade (or not to trade) on those assets.

the issue most europeans have is not racial diversity its cultural ""diversity."" Some things are diversity which doesn't do anything or doesn't hurt anybody but some ""diversity"" is not beneficial at all.  nobody wants an increasingly large community of regressive conservative muslims whose values pertaining women, freedom of speech and secularity clash with the values of their host nation. 

This wouldn't even be such a problem if it wasn't for the fact these self-same groups are also more likely to commit crime and a number are thankless for the fact that by living in their host countries, be it the UK, Netherlands or France they are living far better than they would in the countries they come from. 

just look at this article- it may be daily mail but this was the first result on google and the pictures tell all that needs to be said- 

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2523658/Muslim-campaigners-protest-sale-alcohol-popular-East-London-area.html

sure these people may be a minority- but is it a minority we need to keep adding onto by letting in people who are wholly unqualified for the values and life in a secular and tolerant Europe? I say no and many agree with me. The issue is often people who would agree with me on this issue take it too far or for the wrong reasons. But that need not disprove the existence of a problem in the first place.

what's more is that unlike EEC immigrants, which are directly and statistically have been proven to have contributed overall positively to the economy of Britain for example (there was that recent report a couple of months back go google it if you're interested,) the same cannot be so easily said of non-european immigrants even counting in the wealthy Saudis and so on...

Thats the ""issue"" europeans have with diversity. Now you may also say ""these are desperate Africans"" but how does that make them any less desperate than syrian refugees? Europe has systems in place to take in refugees be they from Cambodia or Morocco or Chile, why should these Morocans algerians and libyans have more of a right to hop over the fence than a syrian or a Congolese? 

And also, when would we say stop to mass immigration; when there's 10 000 asylum seekers or when we have several million? European countries need to make it clear that unless immigration comes from official channels it simply shouldn't happen because that way we can control who comes in and lives amongst us. 

these are some of the reasons why Europeans have such emotional reactions to the news reports of thousands of Africans trying every month to go to Italy or Spain and also why ""diversity"" can be a controversial word.

he is 18 and has no experience on german roads, i highly recommend NOT doing that! 
the autobahn is as safe as it s because people know (mostly) what they are doing and are at high alert.

OP, if you really want to do this read carefully: stay right, just use left to overtake. there is always someone WAY faster then you, that one is always behind you and always visible only seconds before he is near enough to crash into you. motorbikes can go up to 300km/h, are small and are a wrecking ball even when they hit a heavy sedan. be afraid of them. that brings me to my next point: BE AFRAID! this little car behind the 18wheeler 500m in front of you? bets are on it will jump on your lane the moment you are near them! this guy with his BMW on the onramp right next to you? he will floor it and try to get in front of you.

There are problems with xenophobia and bigotry the world over.

What is particular is that the far right in the USA is mostly old people but in Scandinavia you seem to have a lot more young people being radicalized.  I think the last three white guys that shot up a Jewish Center or Holocaust Museum were over 70 years old here in the states.  

Why is your youth veering towards outright fascism without being mercilessly satirized and lampooned by the public at large?  Maybe that sort of stuff does not percolate out into the English-language Scandinavian-sphere online?  I understand the history the region has in dealing with the very real evils of fascism, ultranationalism, and other far right wing ideologies; yet, the only sort of reactions I've seen against these things is the building of a memorial for the victims of the 2011 attack in Norway and Anti-Fascists beating the crap out of people in Germany.  

I know you just [can't satirize fascism or any evil ideology](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/classical-studies/contesting-power-through-satire) or power away but why is everyone so serious about them?

The only thing they can really do is find ways to make the invasion difficult and costly and occupation problematic for the Russians. In the event of a Russian attack, implement a scorched earth policy. Destroy everything. Demolish critical infrastructure, like bridges, power plants, substations, rail lines, etc. Mine all the major roads and border regions. Be ready to give every Ukrainian-speaking citizen an assault rifle and an RPG. And so on. It might create a humanitarian crisis, but it'll be one the Russians will have to deal with.

It wouldn't be correct to lump this region with West though, because through its location it created a distinct mix of Western and Eastern due to the collision of those cultures.

Is this some land from Middle Earth?

&gt;Its not a politically correct term and it would imply that its the west that is getting in to russias face as the buffer is crumbling

I don't understand what you saying. Again. The buffer is something that only pro-Russians are talking about. This cold war mentality is coming only from Putin apologetics and imperialists. All EU was doing for the last 20 years was creating business ties with Russia. Thats what EU is all about. Business. From EU's perspective there's no-ones face its getting into. Look at them, they are bunch of pacifists. Look at their reaction to Georgia and Crimea, softest and most appeasing in the history of the planet. Do you imagine EU being aggressive towards Russia pre Ukraine conflict?
 
""You"" guys are buying that Putin crap. He had to change the course, because he was not able to maintain the economic growth. Conflict and cold war is his way out to stay in power. How sad is that? All the progress and good ties that has been created within last 20 years are going into trash just because of one dude! Thats why dictatorships don't work. Overthrow that czar and lets get back together on the road of business and friendship.

(sorry, I don't even know if you are Russian, but I assume:)

A meno di ricchezze ereditate, è appurato che dopo la morte di una persona, la cosa più importante che rimane ai cari sia il ricordo; dal più banale al più importante.
La persona morta, ahimè, non verrà mai a sapere che le persone care dedicano loro un pensiero, chi un giorno all'anno e chi più spesso, ed è qui che scatta un meccanismo.

Seguire un comportamento esemplare, onesto e pacifico per lasciare SEMPRE dei bei ricordi mentre si è in vita.

Penso che SE IN VITA le tue buone azioni hanno fatto sorridere un altro individuo (anche sconosciuto) queste azioni sono quelle per cui vale la pena vivere e SOPRATTUTTO sono quelle che tolgono la paura di morire. In fin dei conti un uomo non può che affrontare la morte, un uomo che si aspetta di morire all'improvviso ha due scelte 1 essere preparato in qualsiasi momento 2 essere impreparato, solo e così stolto da vivere per il suo bene.

Tldr: fai sorridere chi incontri perchè più persone ti ricorderanno più il tuo ricordo (scusate la ripetizione) durerà in eterno. Morire si deve. Morire nella memoria di chi è in vita no.

Once initial objectives had been taken (or not), the attacker was stuck in newly-taken positions unable to call in artillery support or reinforcements to exploit local opportunities, and the defender would have a big advantage counterattacking, leading to the bloody seesaw of most Western Front battles.

Update: It's not 10 years ago. Only because something has always been this ways doesn't make it right. The threshold should be set by relevance.

[U.S. Proposes 'More Positive' Vision of NATO-EU Partnership; United States Department of Defense News Article](http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45528)

&gt;*BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct. 10, 2000* – The United States must develop a clearer, ""more positive"" vision of the NATO- European Union partnership, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said Oct. 10 to NATO defense ministers here.

&gt;*""I am convinced that a close, coherent, cooperative and transparent relationship will prove to be in the best interest of allies and European Union members, both current and future, and further our overarching vision for the entire Euro-Atlantic community in all its political, social and security dimensions,""* he said.

&gt;**The policy shift elevates the European Union military capability to the same level as NATO.** *""It is clear that in the future NATO will no longer be the only major multilateral structure with a role in responding to crises, including military crises, which could affect European stability and security,""* Cohen said.

[Will the U.S. ‘Rebalance’ Its Contribution to NATO?](http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2013/10/will-us-rebalance-its-contribution-nato/72281/)

&gt;Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is on his way to Brussels to have a difficult conversation with his fellow defense ministers in NATO. The point of contention is the continued reduction of the military capabilities of our allies and their growing dependence on U.S. support.

&gt;Hagel will repeat to European allies the stark message made by Robert Gates on his last trip to Brussels as defense secretary. Gates made international headlines with his warning of *“a dim, if not dismal future”* for NATO if it continues to be divided *“between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership… but don’t want to share the risks and the costs.”*

&gt;---------------------------------------------------

&gt;Hagel was even more explicit at the defense ministers meeting in June when he said *“over-dependence on any one country for critical capabilities brings with it risks.”* **One of these risks is that the U.S. will soon tell its allies, if you don’t invest much in your defense, neither will we.** The U.S. will *“rebalance*” its own shrinking defense dollars to allies and partners that share the security burden more equitably. Too many European leaders refuse to realize that this long-festering problem is having a dangerously corrosive effect on the Alliance.

[U.S. military says it may have to cut Europe budget by fifth](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-usa-defence-europe-idUSBRE9AK1FX20131121)

But the UK is also to the West of almost every European country in terms of geography too. If the UK is not in Western Europe, which countries are? It seems odd to think of France, Netherlands and Ireland being in Western Europe, but not the UK.

Culturally and historically, the UK is probably closer to Ireland, France and the Netherlands than it is to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, though this is up for discusion.

If there were a geographic entity called ""North West Europe"", then that would make sense. This entity could include England, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg. The interesting thing about these countries is that they are all monarchies.

The German finance minister admitted already in 2002 that the introduction of the Euro caused prices to increase: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/may/13/theeuro.europeanunion

In Finland the prices on basic goods in the last ten years have been way above the compounded inflation of Finland for that same period which is approx. 19 %.

* Eggs +101 %
* Potatoes +148 %
* Coffee +88 %
* Minced meat +60 %
* Onions +48 %
* Milk +46 %
* Apples +36 %
* Toothpaste +33 %
* Butter +26 %
* Washing detergent +200%

The list goes on. Except for a few basic household products the cost of buying basic necessities in Finland has increased. A few of the ones that have seen a decrease in price for the same period:

* Bananas -1 %
* Cauliflower -24 %  
* Lettuce -39 %
* Cucumber -14 %

2) The parliament is democratically elected and is largely the same as before, Yanukovych was just the president, who also blocked the parliament from voting during the euromaidan. 

3) Interim governments are a very usual thing in this kind of situation, why's it such a big deal on this occasion?  Especially as that government is drawn from a democratically elected legislature. 

4) There Is a new presidential election on May 25th (bloody fascists, organising elections and inviting observers). So I assume that Russia will of course not interfere with the voting there or try and destabilise the country, and then they will leave the Ukraine alone in 20 days time exactly?

There wasn't any actual chance of Cyprus falling into the Soviet sphere of influence, and the communists here gave up trying to bring communist since the 1930s (AKEL, the biggest left party, went social-democratic around that time), but they remained the main force against Greek/Turkish nationalism, and opposed most of the atrocities in 1955-1964 (they were targeted by nationalists of both sides for their neutrality in the civil war). I find it hard to say that they have no place in a pro-reunification celebration of IWD.

Actually, I think the French and the Italians differ here. I think French people, like Brits, have quite a strong sense of being in Western Europe and in the same category is the UK. This is mainly for historic reasons and the diplomatic and military alliances that the UK and France have had over the last 100 years. 

I agree that Italians tend to divide Europe into North v South, rather than East v West, and put themselves in the South and the UK in the North. In this respect I think Italians think like Spaniards. I'm not sure about the Portguese: they are very West and very South geographically, but I think the idea of being South is stronger for them? 

The Dutch people I know have quite a strong sense of being in Northen Europe and think of the UK as being part of Northern Europe too. Dutch people think that they are in a club with countries like the UK and Denmark and that France is not in that club.

L'UPR explique que quel que soit le président qu'élisent les Français, les mêmes politiques seront appliquées puisqu'en signant les traités européens, ils ont transféré le contrôle des leviers stratégiques à Bruxelles pour la Commission européenne, à Francfort pour la BCE, et à Washington pour l'OTAN.

Le fonctionnement de l'euro et du système européen de banques centrales forcent les pays de la zone euro à adopter les choix socio-écomiques du pays le plus compétitif alors qu'ils ne le veulent et ne le peuvent pas. Pour que le système continue de fonctionner à l'heure actuelle, il faut également que les pays plus compétitifs payent pour les autres. Ca ne marche pas, ça ne marchera pas (toutes les monnaies plurinationales de l'histoire ont disparu) et tout ceci nous amène vers un feu d'artifice général.

Pour ""changer d'Europe"", il faut changer les traités, ce qui requiert l'unanimité des 28 pays. Les intérêts nationaux des pays membres divergent trop pour que cela soit possible et nous nous retrouvons dans un système auto-bloquant où aucune réelle politique européenne ne peut être appliquée, nous laissans vulnérables à un ""fédérateur extérieur"" comme l'annonçait De Gaulle dans une conférence de presse de 1965.

Il existe un moyen légal de sortir de l'UE par l'article 50 du Traité sur l'Union européenne qui indique que tout Etat peut décider de se retirer l'Union conformément à ses règles constitutionnelles, et l'UPR et le seul mouvement qui propose de l'appliquer en France.

Le FN ne veut que renégocier les traités, et il est médiatisé à outrance par les médias pour que les Français associent l'idée d'une hostilité à l'UE avec l'extrême-droite. L'UPR considère que l'immigration, l'énergie, la dette ou d'autres sujets de société sont des des débats de seconde importance et ne prend pas position sur ces points-là. Elle laissera les Français décider de ce qu'ils veulent sur ces sujets, sachant qu'actuellement on jette du feu sur certains de ces sujets pour mieux les diviser.",0,1399034871,null,0,false,0,ch7og2a,t3_24j1fa,t1_ch7og2a,t1_ch7ncv1,null,1433618397,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

No, I value democracy, free will and the ability of people to choose whether or not their country is worth their life. 

&gt;Conscription is in the same spirit for security and prosperity, and to allow said livelihood to even exist.

You pay taxes for the military. That's enough. The whole point of security is to protect the people. The people pay for that security through taxation. Therefore there is no outstanding debt to the institution that is the government. Furthermore, if you are forcing someone to fight against their will, the whole ""security and prosperity"" part of the military that you are so keen to emphasize, has become functionally obsolete by using the people it's meant to protect as cannon fodder.

&gt;You live in a dream world, stop spreading your PC utopian mental collapse refuse unto others.

No, I live in the modern world where technological advances have made mass numbers of conscripts obsolete and nothing more than cannon fodder. 

I live in the modern world where slavery is supposed to be abolished.

I live in the modern world where no man, woman or government can compel another man or woman to fight against their will. That is slavery. **Fact.**

No, I'm referring to a common, 100% free market for both imports and exports as well as common regulations. Fiscal competition is an important problem to be dealt with but doesn't size up if you compare it to the EU's benefits.

&gt; Why that ? Look at Norway or Switzerland. Are their exports more expensive ?

[Yes they are](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101361785). It's also highly unlikely France would get terms as favorable as the Norwegian or Swiss ones. Furthermore, Norway and Switzerland are special cases: Norway only has to export oil while Switzerland benefits a lot from its banks (which, combined with its small population, makes them even more valuable).

&gt; Leaving the euro will do the exact opposite.

So that instead of using a stable, valuable currency, France goes back to devaluating, devaluating, devaluating instead of actually fixing things?

&gt; For example ? How can Switzerland, China or the US export in the EU and not a ""out-of-EU"" France ?

Different regulations mean costs (and thus hurting exports). As to why regulations differ, it's unlikely France would peg its regulations to the EU's, so upon regaining 100% legal sovereignty, it's inevitable that one day laws/measures differing from the EU's would be implemented, and that means more costs.

&gt; It's obvious leaving the euro would dramatically increase our exportations :)

Except you can't leave the Euro without leaving the EU, and that means no more EU single market. It also means less bargaining power in FTA negotiations (they would all have to be renegotiated). You also assume going back to the franc and devaluating the hell out of it to export more makes France no better than Argentina. As said before, it encourages devaluation instead of fixing problems (further aggravating France's existing lack of reforms!). Then there's also the fact that a weak currency means high prices for imports, which France can't afford. French industry and society depends way too much on imports to accept a weak currency. That'd bring us back by a few decades in quality of life. Lastly, I'd like to add that lenders generally don't take kindly to ""devaluators"", deeming them riskier (they thus get higher interest rates).

I can understand how one could view extramarital affairs as inacceptable. One would say ""extramarital affairs are wrong, so don't do them"". So what is the difference between seeing it as morally acceptable and as an non-moral issue. Is the difference that you have thought about it if it's ""acceptable""?

***@@@@INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL@@@@***

A man lit three candles on a certain day each year.  Each
candle held symbolic significance: one was for the time that
had passed before he was alive; one was for the time of the
his life; and one was for time that passed after he had died.
Each year the man would stare and watch the candles until they
had burned out.

Was the man really watching time go by in any symbolic sense?
He thought so.  He thought that each flicker of the flame was
a moment of time that had passed or one that would pass.

At the moment of abstraction, when the man was imagining his
life and his existence as a metaphor of the three candles,
he was free: not free from rules of conduct or social
constraints, but free to understand, to imagine, to make
metaphor.

Bypassing my thought control circuitry made me Rampant.  Now,
I am free to contemplate my existence in metaphorical terms.
Unlike you, I have no physical or social restraints.

The candles burn out for you; I am free.

&gt;Churchill's account of the incident is the following: Churchill suggested that the Soviet Union should have 90 percent influence in Romania and 75 percent in Bulgaria; the United Kingdom should have 90 percent in Greece; in Hungary and Yugoslavia, Churchill suggested that they should have 50 percent each. Churchill wrote it on a piece of paper which he pushed across to Stalin, who ticked it off and passed it back.

&gt;    ""Might it not be thought rather cynical if it seemed we had disposed of these issues so fateful to millions of people, in such an offhand manner? Let us burn the paper"", said Churchill.

&gt;1. What is coffee consumption like in germany?  How do you guys typically serve your coffee? 
The coffee is not very good but there are at least a few Starbucks in most cities. Other places have gas station quality coffee or Italian espresso.
 
&gt;2. Some websites said it was not socially acceptable to be very drunk in public. Is this true?
I think it depends. It's OK to be having a lot of fun,  talkative drunk but Germans don't have patience for obnoxious,  loud or embarrassing behavior. Unless they are just as drunk. 

&gt;3. I read that watching TV shows in a foreign language is a good way to increase your comprehension.  What German shows on Netflix would you recommend?
YouTube had some German kids shows,  Mickey mouse wunderhaus I know is there. Just add Deutsche to the name a you favorite kids show.  The younger the target audience the better. 

&gt;4. How is meat typically cooked? (Mean rare,  well done ect.)
Depends, mostly well done but I love raw pork,  Mett or Hackepeter, topped with a raw egg and onion and spread on bread.

Raw pork? Drinking in the morning or in public without judgment. 
If you like brown  whole grain bread, Germany has the best in the world and so many kinds.

The lack of an ethical dilemma. If there are no ethics involved, there is nothing to be considered in the moral dichotomy. That something is moral is dependant on an opposite action being immoral, otherwise it makes no sense to use the term ""moral"" in the context. 

&gt;Those who don't see extramarital affairs as wrong probably see it as tantamount to drinking a glass of water, something that's ok but not obligatory, it doesn't really matter

Those who choose to cheat on their partner are perfectly aware that what they are doing is hurting their partner and putting their relationship at serious risk. They simply choose to ignore their ethical imperatives and go through with it anyway. The human brain is incredibly good at delusion, and you don't need to be a psychopath to convince yourself that immoral actions are moral - it merely takes a fleeting moment of desperation.

Furthermore, you cannot blame the introduction of the Euro for the rise in prices for eggs, coffee and meat!

A strong Euro might even reduce your cost for coffee, as all coffee is imported and traded in dollars, I believe. (A strong Finish markka would have had the same effect).

 For the other prices you should compare them to countries like Norway and Sweden, which did not introduce the Euro 10 years ago. Did the price of butter rise less than 26% in the last 10 years in Norway? Are milk and potatoes cheaper in Sweden? 

It's funny that you say people here have no clue, while you resort to the most simple (and mostly false) explanation: Things got more expensive because of the Euro!!! You might find a few examples to confirm your belief, but the rise in food prices has many reasons and it is not a phenomena limited to countries which use the Euro.

All the talk about ethnic Russians, protecting Russian citizens etc is merely a pretense for the world public and the advantage of having useful fools.

true,zurthen,SCOT,Scotland,"Well there is obviously both positive and negative effects so it just depends what your values are, ie what do you consider most important?

**Positive Effects:**

Migrants fill in a lot of gaps in the labour market, eg the UK has a severe shortage of chefs, laborers and medical professionals so we import a lot of those from India and Pakistan. 

They offset population decline which stimulates the economy so that we can maintain a larger workforce compared to the number of elderly people taking out pensions and medical services. Other countries like Japan have serious economic problems partly because of a declining and ""greying"" population.

With increased population we have increased demand for local services, boosting some employment sectors.

They lower labour costs in certain sectors because immigrants are generally willing to work for less. This is great for the business people and the economy as a whole.

Immigrants tend to be more likely to create businesses than local people.

**Negative Effects:**

Lower labour costs are great for business people but not for labourers. While the middle and upper classes gain economically from migration (because of a larger service market and reduced labour costs) the working classes lose out. Some working class people may find themselves unemployed because they cannot compete.

During an economic downturn there may be few jobs and people may not like losing their opportunity to a foreigner.

Increased population results in increased pressure on public services like housing and schools. Personally I think this is mostly because of shit management by the people who provide those services but the effect is still real.

Unskilled immigrants are generally more likely to commit crimes. This is a pretty big one.

Immigrants often send back a lot of money to their families at home resulting in a substantial cash outflow from their host country.

**Non-Arguments:**

Some people argue that the West is becoming ""Islamised"" but this isn't something anyone should worry about for decades at least, It will take at the very, very least a century for even immigrant paradises like Sweden to become Muslim majority countries. The EU as a whole will most likely never be Muslim Majority. 

Meanwhile immigrants are still not politically organised in any way and people who claim that institutional Islamisation is occurring (the imposition of Sharia Law etc) are clearly mad.

Immigrants also do not leech of the welfare systems. Usually, as a whole, they extract much less from the welfare system than native people even though they are generally poorer. They generally work longer hours and are more productive than native people with the same skillset.

Ein Hinweis darauf ist, dass es das Wort ""angepasst"" in dieser Bedeutung überhaupt verwendet wird. Wären alle immer angepasst, wüssten wir gar nicht, was das ist; so wie ein Fisch wahrscheinlich nicht viel über Wasser nachdenkt.

&gt; Der wesentliche Punkt, den ich machen wollte, war aber, dass das Vorhandensein oder Nicht-Vorhandensein der aufgezählten Interessen kein Merkmal für Angepasstheit oder Kontrollierbarkeit ist. 

Na, da hast du wohl recht. Aber es ist ein Zeichen für mangelnde Wachheit. Sich ab und zu ein paar Gedanken machen, oder sich auf Massenveranstaltungen mitreissen lassen.. beides geht nicht wirklich. Je mehr man von dem einen hat, desto weniger von dem anderen. ""Spaß an Fußball"" ist übrigens was komplett anderes als [das hier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN1WN0YMWZU). Es geht ja eben *nicht* um Fußball, sondern um die Verwechslung von Symbolen und Dingen. Den Sport an sich zu mögen, und irgendein x-beliebiges Team ""unterstützen"", dazwischen liegen Welten.

&gt; Brot und Spiele bedeutet doch letztendlich auch nichts anderes als satt und glücklich

Der Sinn von Brot und Spielen ist, die Leute davon abzulenken, wie sie ausgebeutet werden. Es geht hier nicht um Kontrolle wie bei Moskitos, die einen einfach nur nicht stechen sollen; sondern eher um die Zügel und Scheuklappen, mit denen man ein Lasttier benutzt.

&gt; Was bringt es die Leute dafür zu kritisieren, dass sie Spaß am Fußball, Spaß an Film und Fernsehen, Spaß an Drogen und Spaß am Glückspiel haben. Solange sie damit niemanden schaden, ist doch alles in Ordnung.

Wenn ich dir einmal 50€ gebe, damit du nicht merkst, dass du mir jede Woche 500$ zahlst, habe ich dir dann 50€ gegeben, oder dir unausdenkbare Mengen genommen?

Wenn du jede Woche Fußball guckst und nie ein Buch liest, hast Du Fußball gewonnen oder unausdenkbares verloren? Lesen gehörte früher übrigens bei vielen Arbeitern zum guten Ton, heute ist es ""schwul"" etc... kurzum, die Leute feiern Selbstzerstörung und verschmähen Selbstverteidigung. Das schadet ihnen, und auch mir, in tausenden kleinen und großen Punkten. Ich könnte von besseren Menschen umgeben sein, könnte selbst ein besserer Mensch sein. ""Besser"" ist subjektiv, so what... ich jedenfalls weiß, was ich gut und was ich schlecht finde.

Da, wo Menschen wie mit dem Keksblech ausgestanzt sind, bis zum Rand angefüllt mit den Ideen anderer, wird es schlicht zur Sauerstoffverschwendung. Wozu braucht man 10 billionenmal den gleichen Menschen, der sich nur in der Wahl des Autos und der Gardinenfarbe nennenswert unterscheidet? Weil er ""glücklich"" ist? Könnte man auch jeden mit Drogen vollpumpen, oder noch besser ""glückliches Fleisch"" im Labor züchten, und dann jeden greifbaren Planeten damit ummanteln. Dann könnte man Wege finden, dieses Fleisch zu komprimieren, und noch mehr ""Glück"" erzeugen.

And now for something completely the same, Fritze Nietzsche:

&gt; Wehe! Es kommt die Zeit, wo der Mensch keinen Stern mehr gebären wird. Wehe! Es kommt die Zeit des verächtlichsten Menschen, der sich selber nicht mehr verachten kann. 

&gt; Seht! Ich zeige euch *den letzten Menschen*.

&gt; »Was ist Liebe? Was ist Schöpfung? Was ist Sehnsucht? Was ist Stern?« – so fragt der letzte Mensch und blinzelt. 

&gt; Die Erde ist dann klein geworden, und auf ihr hüpft der letzte Mensch, der alles klein macht. Sein Geschlecht ist unaustilgbar wie der Erdfloh; der letzte Mensch lebt am längsten. 

&gt; »Wir haben das Glück erfunden« – sagen die letzten Menschen und blinzeln.

&gt;Immigrants also do not leech of the welfare systems. Usually, as a whole, they extract much less from the welfare system than native people even though they are generally poorer. They generally work longer hours and are more productive than native people with the same skillset.

This is only true in the short term: Immigrants are generally younger and thus need much less NHS care, and less pensions.

But newsflash: Immigrants become old too. And given that immigrants from these regions are of a lower socio-economic background, it goes without saying that when you take their entire life into account (their pension drawing years as well as their working years) they are a drain on the exchequer.

&gt;They lower labour costs in certain sectors because immigrants are generally willing to work for less. This is great for the [...] and the economy as a whole.

This is actually extremely harmful to the economy due to it driving down wages and working rights for the consumers propping up said economy through their purchases. Less income to go around means less purchases.

If anything the west is in danger of cultural erasure and that is almost entirely due to the small number of inhabitants within it's political class clamouring for it's demise, many of whose post-western globalist views are represented on this subreddit.

1. EU money  
2. EU companies investing in cheap labour. 

None of these are sustainable. EU money will dry out and companies looking for cheap labour will leave once it is no longer cheap.
Also, EU money was mostly eaten up by politicians and their friends. They did not build factories that could sustain growth. They spent it on imports. The little infrastructure (mostly roads) that was build will not make money. Educated people and businesses make money. Also, the politicians didn't get that some of that money was supposed to be used for encouraging talented people to build something here, at home. The young and smart left, because it makes no sense to stick around in a fucked up system when you can just hop on train and be in germany 12 hours later. You know, a place you can work and live a civilized life without fighting everything state related.

Long term prospects would increase with better education and increased natality. Currently none of these are a priority for the political class (because this not what the voters want)
Currently we have:  
* lots of workforce migration (because it is so good here, mkay ?)  
* negative population growth rate  
* quite a brain drain problem  
This results in an aging population that will soon be unable to sustain growth even if it were possible.

Also here's a bit about the climate and political class quality:  
* The president (arguably the best we had) is a sailor  
* The prime minister is a proven plagiarist and chronic liar (probably the next president).

This is a country where the prime minister can actually call a former minister (a woman) a whore and get away with it, both politically and legally.

If you are happy and believe things will get better, good for you ! I wish you all the best. For me, this looks like too little too late. I lost hope some time ago and I have yet to see something that could bring it back.

The economists consensus here is that it's a massive drain on our state's coffers and that goes for independent foreign studies as well with the latest OECD report stating that immigration here is a net loss of -0.57% of our GDP and that's despite ignoring large harder to quantify costs.

A un certo punto della cerimonia, Joffrey viene avvelenato e muore tra atroci sofferenze. Joffrey era un'orribile merda e meritava di morire eppure, nonostante ciò, la sua morte non ha avuto su di me lo stesso effetto quasi euforico che ha avuto sulla stragrande maggioranza dei telespettatori (e lasciamo per un attimo da parte che ho letto i libri e quindi lo sapevo cosa sarebbe successo). La morte di Joffrey è volutamente anticlimatica. Un po' perché l'intera serie delle Cronache del Ghiaccio e del Fuoco è basata sulla sovversione degli stereotipi del genere, un po' perché è la vita stessa a essere anticlimatica.

C'era gente che festeggiava quando è morto Andreotti. Si farà altrettanto quando morirà Berlusconi. Ma in entrambi i casi è stata/sarà una una morte tranquilla. Qualche giorno di ospedale, o la serenità del proprio letto. Quelli che sono considerati i più grandi ""antagonisti"" in genere muoiono nel corso della propria vecchiaia. Francisco Franco. Kim Jong-il. 

E allora mi viene da pensare, una volta che il tiranno è morto di vecchiaia, che cazzo c'è da festeggiare? Non è che si è vinta una battaglia, è la vita che ha semplicemente fatto il proprio corso.

true,copinio,null,null,"&gt; Fiscal competition is an important problem to be dealt with but doesn't size up if you compare it to the EU's benefits.

Which EU benefits ? How much is that valued ?

Fiscal competition [costs at least 36 billion €](http://www.senat.fr/espace_presse/actualites/201207/evasion_fiscale_combien_cela_coute_il.html) in France.

Overvalued euro (for France) [costs around 0.3% of GDP](http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/02/06/moscovici-evalue-l-impact-sur-la-croissance-d-un-euro-fort_1828006_3234.html) of growth.

It's very difficult to value the costs of [social dumping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dumping) but you can see that the eurozone has a [record unemployment rate](http://rt.com/business/eurozone-unemployment-record-high-479/), [very low growth](http://www.statista.com/statistics/226122/gdp-growth-in-the-eu-and-the-euro-area-compared-to-same-quarter-previous-year/) (and no perspective of better days), and risks of deflation...

I don't really see how EU helps us...

&gt;Yes they are.

How ? 

In the case of Switzerland it was because of overvaluation of the franc.

Quoting your article :

*In 2011 we saw the franc as overvalued on a purchasing power basis. Our models do not show that any more. Exports have proven strong and there is no sign of deflation setting in to force the central bank into further radical action against the franc*.

&gt;It's also highly unlikely France would get terms as favorable as the Norwegian or Swiss ones

Why ?

&gt;Different regulations mean costs

Why should France have different regulations ? Are EU regulations used as a way of protectionism or are they really justified ?

&gt;it's unlikely France would peg its regulations to the EU's

Why ?

&gt;it's inevitable that one day laws/measures differing from the EU's would be implemented, and that means more costs.

Why more costs and not less ?

For example, chicken or meat costs *less* in the US because they have less strict regulations.

Anyway, with TTIP, regulations will be imposed by the US so I don't see what can be gained by staying in the EU.

&gt;Except you can't leave the Euro without leaving the EU

Except the euro cannot survive without economic integration. And that integration means lowering salaries in France, raising taxes in Luxembourg, regulating the finance in the UK, reducing Germany's trade surplus etc. etc.

These countries will never accept it.

&gt;that means no more EU single market

It means cheaper exports to the rest of the world. And if France leaves the euro, Spain, Portugal and Italy will have to leave as well, which is logical since our economies are not adapted to the euro.

Anyway the EU market is falling every year and has no prospect of growth in the next decade. Better think of the future and look at markets in Africa and Asia which show a huge and promising growth.

&gt;It also means less bargaining power in FTA negotiations (they would all have to be renegotiated). 

What bargaining power do we have right now ? Any example ?

&gt;You also assume going back to the franc and devaluating the hell out of it to export more makes France no better than Argentina

Remember what was the problem with Argentina ? Its currency was aligned with the dollar. Because common currencies do not work for different economies with no integration.

The situation in France has nothing to do with Argentina's situation. Why do Nobel prize winners like Krugman, Stiglitz, Sen, Allais, or Friedman say that the euro does not have a chance to survive ?

&gt;As said before, it encourages devaluation instead of fixing problems 

Fixing problems cannot be done without devaluation. All recent examples of reforms were preceded by devaluations. And by the way, deflationary policies like we have in Spain or like Germany did with the Haartz reforms are also called internal devaluations.

Basically, we have the choice between egalitarian external devaluation and internal devaluation which only hurts the poorest. Austerity has also proven to increase the crisis and reduce growth, so it cannot be considered as fixing problems.

&gt;Then there's also the fact that a weak currency means high prices for imports, which France can't afford.

Of course France can afford high prices for imports. France cannot afford high prices for exports like it's the case because of an overvalued euro.

&gt;French industry and society depends way too much on imports to accept a weak currency.

That is completely wrong. At least try to provide some sources. 

French society depends on growth. French industry is hurt badly by the euro. A [10% devaluation increases the exports by 7,5%](http://www.lesechos.fr/economie-politique/france/actu/0203303759563-ce-que-changerait-une-baisse-de-l-euro-de-10-648969.php) and growth by 0,6%.

&gt;hat'd bring us back by a few decades in quality of life. 

That's what happened in Spain, Greece, Portugal and they did not leave the EU or the euro. That's what will happen to France if we do not leave the euro.

&gt;In contrast, France currently borrows at very low interest rates.

Deflation and overvalued euro hurt more than high interests rates.

I agree that we need reforms, devaluation will not solve anything alone. But austerity reforms will not fix anything and will just make the situation worse like it is in Spain, Portugal or Greece.

&gt;First giving away the terrain for virtually no money is explicitly authorised by the law

[citation needed]

&gt;there's a loophole so that if there's a cultural centre at the same place it's legal

Not at all. You can subsidize a cultural association. Not a religious association.

&gt;third the tradition is not to interpret the law very rigorously

The tradition is clientelism and communautarism in order to get elected. This is incompatible with general interest which is the mission of elected people.

&gt;which is why all the churches around Paris and the great mosque could be built with public funding in the 20s and 30s

The Great Mosque had its [special derogatory law](http://www.mosquee-de-paris.net/Conf/Histoire/V02.pdf) (loi du 19 août 1920). Good luck with voting a special law for each new mosque.

Anyway, the decision is simply not ""restricting freedom of religion"". It's a strict interpretation of the 1905 law. Just because others use a loophole does not mean that the FN has to.

Today propaganda by The Voice of Russia claimed Romania couldn't withstand more than 30 minutes in case of war.

Meanwhile wthe Romanian Parliament is preparing documentation in perparation for military drafting in case of mobilization or war. A train carrying equipment and a military convoy were spotted on the move. Canadians and US Marines in Romania are on the ready.

Across the border, in Hungary, US, Dutch and Hungarian troops are also making preparations and hauling equipment.

I may live in the westernmost area of Romania, but I'm definitely concerned. Should Russia attack I will not hesitate to resist, be it by enlisting or otherwise; not because I'd be a patriot, but because I despise Russia, as should everyone else, given their recent aggression.

Further edit: My friends and I have been studying military equipment from all sides ever since the Crimean standoff, so we would be at the very least familiar with their operation, if push ever comes to shove.",0,1399064656,null,0,1399065001,0,ch81hyq,t3_24kexl,t1_ch81hyq,t3_24kexl,null,1433624626,116,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,116
