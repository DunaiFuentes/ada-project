There is a small enough, but vocal part of the CPO that is fighting it.  I voted no at the time because they were not telling us a damn thing, just that we might move.  At the time the rumor was heavy it would be Earl's Court and it was to be a boring stadium like the New Library.  Now with the talk of moving to Battersea and the single tier end along with preserving the historic look of Battersea, bravo Roman why the fuck didn't you tell us this the last time.  I think Earl's Court was the cheap place to move and when the CPO pushed back, even against all the back room deals and crap the Chelsea board was trying to pull, he realized he needed to something amazing to get support.  I've seen a lot of my mates who were no voters saying this will be awesome.  It's a shame to leave our home of 107 years and all the history in the area (and the Nandos), but we have to increase capacity to compete on the world stage.  The Bridge is a neat stadium and miles better than most grounds in the UK, but when you go to Europe and you see the places Bayern, RM, Barca, Inter/AC, et al. play in you just can't help but feel that while we stack up on the pitch with our players, we need to compete.  Hell Quest Field in Seattle is a fantastic venue as well, saw Chelsea play Seattle there a few years back and just loved the views it had and the way it held noise.

(Not saying all will see it like that, as those who do vote when they can will be unaffected, but those who choose not to, for whatever reason, may well do).

The good thing about democracy is that you can choose your level of participation: you can choose to fundraise for a campaign, you can choose to go door-to-door campaigning, you can choose to donate to a party, you can choose to work for a party, you can choose to stand as an MP, MEP, or local representative (MSP, councillor, etc).

In the same way, you can choose not to be involved, you can choose not to even vote.

Yes, it is a tragedy when we see such low turnouts, and such voter apathy, but this says as much about the system as it does about the people. One of the functions of elections is to legitimise the system of government. Low turnouts can suggest dissatisfaction with the system.

Lets not forget that it is the system that works for the people, not the people for the system. Therefore, if the system doesn't seem to be working for the people, change the system, don't try and change the people.

Can't wait to see Chelsea again in Seattle come July. I wonder what they will do with the pitch this time. As you probably know, last time grass was laid down at Chelsea's request. As you probably do not know, new FieldTurf was installed in February that just got certified as a Star-2 field by FIFA today. If you're not familiar, FIFA has a 2 star rating for field. Star-1 is only qualified for amateur FIFA events and Star-2 is qualified for Professional FIFA events. I.E. CenturyLink Field (formerly Qwest) can now be used for FIFA events all the way up to the World Cup, with the FieldTurf that is currently installed and without needing to put grass down. FIFA field qualification tests includes measurements to gauge shock absorption, foot stability, rotational resistance, linear friction and ball-to-surface interaction, and a few others. 
**TL:DR** New FieldTurf at CenturyLink reacts more like grass and recieved FIFA star-2 certification.

The media will skew the democratic deficit though. We do have representation and although they cannot legislate they have a huge say in what goes on. 

My ideal EU is one where states are given representation based on their population, the president is elected by the people (or maybe we could have a parliamentary system?), and the people we vote for are the ones who legislate. The EU then takes a certain responsibility in certain fields (i.e. we have a unified military, a unified currency, etc), but countries/states can take it upon themselves to legislate in areas that the EU doesn't have a say. Canada is very loosely tied together, and provinces have a big say on what happens. The point is, a system where the central government has too much power never works. What we need is democracy the whole way up with powers given to the necessary levels.

On top of that, the democratic deficit is not a reason to be anti EU, it is a reason to want reform. The EU is the first non-violent union of states, I think it's something we should be a little proud of. We have come together because we are more powerful as one.

A few loose points on the referendum

* I'm stoked that Bristol bucked the national trend. I think the other YES campaigns lost because those campaigns fell susceptible to a protest vote against the coalition (similar to the AV vote last year), rather than an informed rejection based on the pro's &amp; con's of the subject at hand.

* The most interesting result of the day was the vote of the people of Doncaster to KEEP their elected Mayor by a ratio of almost 2:1. Doncaster was being held up as an example of a failed elected Mayor system too. So much for the people NOT wanting it.

* The winning of the Yes campaign is a sign that the people of Bristol want to do - something, ANYTHING. We don't want to remain static. We're yearning for a change. We're trying. This is good, and to be commended.

* I would like to vote for a Mayor who endeavours to promote investment, deregulation and help for small businesses, and a Mayor who will try to invigorate the vote in the poorer neighbourhoods. (9.9% in Filwood is not good enough).

true,CircleTheFire,lfc99,,"Ack. Didn't realize this was behind the paywal. Here's the text:

&gt;There is a common theme across team sports when it comes to offense: The closer you can get the ball to where you need to go, the more successful you will be. In basketball it means getting shots near the hoop. In football it means starting your possessions in good field position. In hockey it means getting the puck close to the net. And so on.
&gt;
&gt;In soccer, it's no different. The teams that set themselves up with the most opportunities close to their opponent's goal will almost always be more successful than those that don't. This seems simple in theory, but in practice it's quite difficult. Obviously opponents will not just allow a team to set up shop inside their penalty area and hope for the best. It wouldn't be much of a game if they did.
&gt;
&gt;It requires a certain amount of teamwork to penetrate a defense, but more importantly, it necessitates quality athletes and decision-makers on the pitch. Once you make it to as high a level as the Premier League, it becomes less about the X's and the O's and more about the Jimmys and Joes. This is seen clearly in the correlation between spending and winning in the EPL, which is higher than in any of the major American sports leagues.
&gt;
&gt;Then, of course, there are always teams that buck the trend.
&gt;
&gt;Liverpool entered the season having spent most of the $80 million it received from Chelsea via the Fernando Torres transfer on a potpourri of new players. In came Stewart Downing, Jordan Henderson and Charlie Adam, joining Andrew Carroll and Luis Suarez, who were signed less than a year ago. Off the field, the Reds were doing everything necessary to win.
&gt;
&gt;But in an unpredictable manner, Liverpool has endured arguably its most forgettable season on the field as a member of the Premier League.
&gt;
&gt;The Reds are in eighth place, behind archrival Everton, and miles away from the side they thought they would be entering the year. The Reds have been great outside the EPL, winning the League Cup and are set to face Chelsea in the FA Cup final on Saturday, but in the league their results have left a lot to be desired.
&gt;
&gt;So naturally, you would think the Reds have been poor at getting good looks close to the goal, right?
&gt;
&gt;As it turns out, they have been staggeringly efficient at getting the ball near their opponent's goal and keeping it away from their own. While the top three in the table -- Man City, Man United and Arsenal -- are also the top three in passes completed into the penalty area, it's Liverpool that comes in surprisingly at fourth. The Reds have completed 570 passes into the box, 226 more than Newcastle, despite trailing the Magpies by 16 points in the current table.
&gt;
&gt;Even more unbelievable, the Reds have allowed the fewest number of completed passes into their own box in the entire league.
&gt;
&gt;So how can a team that is so good at penetrating defenses and at not being breached itself be so far out of contention?
&gt;
&gt;For starters, the Reds have had been incredibly unlucky. They have had a league-high 29 shots denied by the woodwork, 10 more than any other club. Conversely, their opponents have hit the post only six times. This is the biggest spread in the big-five European leagues.
&gt;
&gt;Certainly this has adversely affected the Reds' results, but the real reason they are stuck in the middle of the table is their dreadful shooting inside the area. So far this season, Liverpool has scored on a mere 9.1 percent of its shots inside the penalty box, nearly two full percentage points behind the next-worst squad and more than five percentage points off the league average. For context, if Liverpool would have converted its shots inside the box at the league-average rate, it would have scored 19 more goals this season, a 44 percent increase in scoring.
&gt;
&gt;On the other side of the field, Liverpool's opponents have been finding the net on a league-high 18.2 percent of their shots. If Liverpool's opponents had converted their shots inside the box at the league-average rate, the Reds would have allowed seven fewer goals this season.
&gt;
&gt;All together, if Liverpool and its opponents had been scoring at the league-average rate on their shots inside the penalty area, the Reds would be plus-31 on goal differential, solidly in third place behind the Manchester squads.
&gt;
&gt;As a good example of Liverpool's struggles in the penalty area, look no further than the team's struggles on penalty shots. To date, the Reds have been awarded five penalties (right at the league average, for those conspiracy theorists out there), but have converted only once. Meanwhile, their opponents have also been awarded five PK's, but have been successful four times. If we flipped teams, that would have been a six-goal swing toward the Reds in only 10 shots.
&gt;
&gt;There is little the Reds can do this late in the season to change the trend. Surely winning the League Cup/FA Cup double will give them momentum heading into next season. But a domestic campaign of wasted chances will stay with this team for a long time.

Kingston, when first introduced, showed this incredible talent in handling complex emotions. She managed to nail this sense of savvy experience one would expect of a seasoned companion, the mystique of someone from the Doctor's future, and the wisdom to understand she can never tell him all of what she knows.

She managed to portray this *deep* love for the Doctor, and managed this complex pain in knowing that he has no idea who she is. That's a rich character with so much promise behind everything she hid. When she said ""spoilers"", it wasn't a cheap catchphrase, it was a promise.

The next time we see her ""hello sweetie"" is reduced to a catchphrase, as is ""spoilers"". She wears slinky dresses and high heels and winks and flirts and in general acts like a *much* less interesting character.

***However***, this isn't hyper-prevalent in her portrayal, at least in Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone. She manages to swallow most of this superficiality and become something vaguely similar to the professor we saw in the library.

The *real* issue is Amy. She causes so many issues to all stories in Doctor Who and is simply not portrayed as a relateable or complex character.

Doctor Who doesn't have a canon. (I feel strongly on this one, canon is like a legal term in how specific its definition is)

The Doctor can be half human, loomed, and naturally born all at the same time. (tie in theory of awesomeness explains it). He has romantic relationships with more people than just Rose, perhaps 13 kids, a deceased wife, a brother, a granddaughter and greatgrandson and parents.

If you note his way of speaking it's actually deceptively flat.

Moffat did not ""revitalize"" either Doctor Who *or* Sherlock Holmes. He just happens to be the latest author stepping in on the franchises during periods *after* they have already been brought to promenence and have become popular again.

There *were* people who revitalized Doctor Who and Sherlock Holmes, but those would be Russel T Davies and Guy Ritchie, respectively.

RTD's run starting in 2005 had become a runaway success and was at the height of it's popularity when Moffat came in. He stepped in only *after* it had been ""revitalized"".

Similarly Guy Ritchie had brought the great detective back to silver screens years before Moffat began his own interpretation, and the property was already very popular by the time that he stepped in.

I mentioned it to my brother, who had seen precisely one episode a few years back: Aliens of London. His description of the show was ""well, there's this random guy who travels around in a phone booth, and then there's something they think is an alien, but it's actually a pig, and then it turns out that the real aliens are in human suits and you can only tell them apart because of their constant farting."" I was more than a little confused, and ended up convinced that it was some sort of parody show.

true,ashmaht,tardis,TARDIS,"I love when the Doctor goes full on ""superhero"" with his epic speeches and his ability to make people cower at the mere mention of his name. For that reason, I thought Night Terrors was an absolutely brilliant episode. 

I also very much enjoyed Tennant's ending. People are always saying that it was a crappy way for him to leave the show. My opinion? He absolutely relished his life throughout the series. And then all his friends slowly slipped away from him. By the end of season 4, he'd been forced to basically destroy his best friend, and see the woman he loved make out with a more human version of himself. First of all, how many previous incarnations of the Doctor have even shown themselves to be capable of romantic love? And secondly, HIS inability to be ""human enough"" to be with Rose probably weighed on him heavily due to the whole ""Family of Blood"" affair when he had to kill off his human self.

Then there's the whole issue of being forced to relive the genocide of his people by ONCE AGAIN sending them into the time lock (including sending his own mother in this time). When I see that scene of Ten saying ""I don't want to go,"" I don't see it as some wimpy, whiny, emo crap. I see it as him realizing all the ways he's failed as this incarnation. All the people he hurt, all the people he failed to protect, and at his worst when he tried to take absolute control as ""the time lord victorious""... I think he was just terrified that ""the next guy"" would just get worse. I think he thought that he had at last learned from his mistakes and that he could do so much more to make the universe a better place... 

I think it was a great ending for Ten. And I think it carried over beautifully into Eleven. Especially now when he's decided that he has to go back into the shadows. He's realizing that the best way to save everyone is by not being there. But at the same time that he's compelled to act, no matter how much it will hurt him.",0,1336192097,null,0,false,0,c4kb0zk,t3_t7rdt,t1_c4kb0zk,t3_t7rdt,null,1428860462,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

as for the the whole ""court"" idea, it makes sense, especially tied into the whole ""first question"". think about what happens when someone is called to the witness stand. they are asked to ""state their name"", which isn't a question. now the doctor would of course reply ""i am the doctor"" which would lead to the first question ""doctor who?"" and since ""no living creature may speak falsely or fail to answer"" the doctor will have to speak his name and that apparently is a big deal. examples:

the shakespeare code - 
Lilith: And as for you, sir Doctor—[she pauses as he stares back at her] Fascinating. There is no name. **Why would a man hide his title in such despair?**

forest of the dead -
The Doctor: River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. **There's only one time I could**...

the pandorica opens - 
The Doctor: [about what is in the Pandorica] There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior... A **nameless**, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.

my guess, since apparently ""silence will fall"" when the question is asked, is the the silence do some serious fucking up to the earth/universe/whatever and the doctor has to go to the fields of trenzalore, knowing very well what will happen when he gets there but also knowing it's the only way to stop the silence, especially considering the extent that the silence have gone to in an attempt to prevent him from getting there since they too know what will happen when the first question is asked. that's why they tried to kill him and will likely continue trying to kill him.

i really shouldn't try to think about these things when operating on only a few hours sleep. i doubt any of it makes sense.

However, you wouldn't want me voting anyway. I was thinking of who I'd have voted for (most likely Labour), but in reality, I don't think any of the parties that will get in, can actually change things enough to make a notable improvement to the UK economy (my primary concern). If, by some miracle, they did enough to actually help, I think whatever they'd do would piss off such a significant portion of the UK population, that it'd probably go against them in the next election, ensuring that whatever plan they'd put into action would be changed before it had time to make any dramatic effect on the economy.

Yes, I know the economy isn't the only concern with who we vote in, there are a great many concerns, in fact. My point being that on the political scale, the parties are a heck of a lot closer, and share far too many interests to actually make any significant difference, *sure* one party will cut funds in the NHS to allow for better education, another will cut funds in education to give more to the NHS. Sure one will block websites that it feels do more harm to the country than good, the end result is still that some people will hate what happens, others won't.

McGann (the Eighth Doctor), on the other hand would love to be involved, and I would love him to come in and sort of bridge the gap between Classic and New Who, and most importantly provide insight on that ol' Time War.

Overall here's what I'd like to see:

A reuniting of *at least* all major New Who characters. The anniversary simply would feel empty without all the Doctor's many friends. Some of Classic Who would also be *brilliant*. (Here's looking at you, Sophia. I want Ace, dammit!)

As for the ""big question"", I do *not* want it to be a name, because that's just not what the question is. I suspect a build up to where you *expect* a name, until someone wisely notes that the question is not ""what is your name?"" but it is ""who are you?"".

The Doctor has been caught between two paths. That of the wise man and the healer he's meant himself to be, or the great warrior, the Oncoming Storm, the Time Lord Victorious.

The question is: Who is he? 

And depending on that answer we may see the Silence in a whole new light as well. Are they trying to prevent the redemption and formation of a good man or are they trying to spare the universe from an angry god at all costs?

And finally this really ought to be Smith's goodbye. I could not imagine a better point to step down as an actor, and ""the fall of the Eleventh"" is going to be playing a big part in the whole climax of this prophecy.

But more than anything I want this to live up to every drop of hype. I want this to be the single greatest success in all of Doctor Who. I want this to live up to every ounce of the show's potential *and then some*.

Having said that, I fear like I'm sailing into ""I don't want to sound racist, but…"" territory, so feel free to sharpen your blue arrow(s).

I don't know whether this is just one show. I don't watch that much TV, so I assumed this was representative of BBC policy, not ""just one show"" that I can ""handle"". 

So I take this in the context of being told repeatedly that Britain is a multicultural country and the fact that I don't have a clue what that's supposed to mean. I mean, I guess I could interpret it to mean that Britain is no longer a country in which the culture is no longer supposed to be English, Scottish and Welsh. But I don't really know.

I believe that it is (or was a few years ago) a question on the citizenship exam, that you have to answer ""Britain is a multicultural country"", and I don't know that my dad, who's 70 and who grew up in Manchester during WWII, would get that right. Likewise, I'm pretty sure we tell our kids in school that Britain is a multicultural country, and I just have to ask, *""well, hang on - when did Britain decide it wanted to be this, and did they ask us if that was ok?""* I mean, ok, fair enough, maybe that was just something that happened, but I just keep hearing this ""multicultural"" word being thrown around without anyone ever bothering to stop and explain to me what it means. 

So, yeah, in that particular series there are 7 characters as part of the main group - one of them is black and two of them are muslim (I'm not sure if asian or middle-eastern). In fact, it's a really good, well-balanced group, because the twenty-something playboy of muslim extraction matures and becomes a role-model for the younger muslim boy whose missing parents have raised him to respect his religion and culture. There are two big, physically strong guys as part of the group, and the black guy is unquestionably a good guy, the white fellow is an ex-convict and nae'er-do-well whose actions we often find dubious.

And I can see it would be iffy putting the black guy in that latter stereotypical bad-guy role. (The show also has a really great recurring minor character who is strong black and female, but unpleasantly authoritarian.) And I can see that maybe a group of 5 whites and 2 middle-easterners might not be diverse enough, but it would be much closer to the national demographic. As it is, minorities are about 4 times over-represented amongst the lead characters.

So it turns out that the BBC *does* have a policy that ""[as part of \[its\] ongoing commitment to diversity [they] ask all producers to discuss … how they plan to make their content and their productions as diverse as possible](http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/resources/diversity.shtml)"", so when I see a group like that that's just *unrecognisably* diverse - that's ""four times as diverse"" as I'd expect amongst a statistically average group of friends in the pub, I do think *""hmmmn… aren't they ramming it down my throat a bit?""* And it turns out that [Samir Shah](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/26/bbc.television), a member of the BBC's board of directors, and [Sarita Malik](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/26/bbc.raceandreligion) (academic in Media, Sociology and Communications) seen to agree.

I have a bit of a problem, really, with the government telling its citizens what to think. I'm unhappy with the idea that the government might achieve that through the spending of revenues it collects from those very same citizens. And I'm particularly uncomfortable with the feeling that the government seems to be able to do this fairly subtly, unnoticed by the general public, not only because most people don't really realise how much we're influenced by marketing and the media, but also because they're able to shape our social narrative over periods spanning decades at a time.

Now I have to admit that I probably wouldn't be saying that if the values that I saw on the BBC were my raging socialist ones - if they were pushing an agenda of ""tax the rich"" and ""end generational wealth"" then I'd be all pompous and like, ""well, I think that we as a society should share these values with our children"" and ""it's important that we should shaping our world for the better"".

But as I've said [elsewhere in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/t7r71/why_do_people_moan_about_the_tv_licence_fee_when/c4kblul), the BBC tends to shows cops as reasonable, over-worked and not at all authoritarian, and with all this it just feels like the BBC are a bit of a vehicle for what the government would like me to think.",0,1336215194,null,0,false,0,c4kd8xm,t3_t7r71,t1_c4kd8xm,t1_c4kc2ju,null,1428861509,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

*According to John Vanderveen, PH.D., director of the FDA?s office of Plant and Dairy Foods and Beverages, ""the more you restrict your diet, the more difficult it is to get the nutrients you need. Vegetarians who exclude all dairy and animal flesh products face the greatest nutritional risks, because some essential nutrients exist only in animal products.*

*Vegans face the risk of inadequate vitamin and mineral levels. Vitamin B12 deficiencies are found in vegans, and this deficiency can lead to irreversible nerve deterioration. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded in 1988 that elderly people should be especially careful when adapting vegetarian diets, because their bodies may absorb vitamin B12 poorly.*

*Vegans and ovo-vegetarians (those who eat eggs but no meat or dairy products) may have low vitamin D and calcium intake. Lack of vitamin D can cause rickets in children, and lack of calcium can lead to osteoporosis later in life. These vegetarians are also at risk for iron-deficiency anemia, not only from exclusion of animal products, but also because of the high dietary fiber content of foods such as soy protein, bran, and fiber. The dietary fiber in these foods actually inhibits iron absorption. Protein deficiency must also be guarded against, which can lead to loss of hair and muscle mass, along with abnormal accumulation of fluid. Care must be taken to ensure proper caloric intake for all vegetarians.*

*Barr, Prior, Janelle, and Lentle (1998) have examined the association of vegetarian diets with spinal bone mineral density. The study used a cross-sectional comparison method of bone mineral density of 23 vegetarians and 22 non-vegetarians, all premenopausal. The subjects were between the ages of 20 and 40, and had normal body weights and menstrual cycles. Twenty of the women participated in repeat measurements 13 months later. Methods used to make comparisons include descriptive statistics, independent samples and paired tests, 1-way analysis of variance, correlation analysis, and stepwise multiple regression. Results showed vegetarians having a lower mean bone mineral density, 1.148 versus 1.216 for non-vegetarians. Vitamin B-12 and body fat were factors used in predicting baseline bone mineral density. Participants in the follow-up study differed only by being slightly older. In one year, mean bone mineral density increased by 1.1% in the diet group, non-vegetarian?s bone mineral density increased, while vegetarians stayed the same. No other monitered variables affected bone mineral density. Conclusions from the study state that vegetarian women should be aware of the association of low bone mineral density with a vegetarian diet.*

*Children with vegetarian diets face additional risks and health concerns. Gretchen Hill, Ph.D., associate professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Missouri, Columbia, believes that many health problems arise among child vegetarians. My bet is those kids will have health problems when they reach 40, 50, or 60 years of age, she says, mostly because of imbalances with micronutrients [nutrients required only in small amounts], particularly iron, zinc, and copper. Hill believes that while vegetarian children will be missing iron from animal products, the most valuable vitamins may be copper and zinc. Copper is essential to the human body in that it builds the bodies immune system, and strengthens and builds red blood cells. A lot of Americans are marginal in this micronutrient, and as a result, are more susceptible to diseases. Children can?t meet their zinc needs without eating meat. Children are also at risk of developing protein defeciency, which can lead to stunted growth.*

*Scientific evidence in support of Hill?s claims does exist. Nathan, Hackett, and Kirby (1997) assessed the growth of vegetarian children as compared to non-vegetarian children. Fifty vegetarian children ages 7 to 11, were compared to a control group of 50 omnivores of similar age, sex, and ethnic group. Main outcome measurements include height, weight, upper arm skinfold thickness, and mid-upper arm circumference measurements, and were taken at baseline and one year later. The results show that only the height increment of non-vegetarians was slightly greater, .47 cm, than that of the omnivores. The difference, however, was only apparent after allowing for father?s height, maternal smoking habit and number of siblings. The tendency for vegetarians to be leaner than the omnivores was not significant. It was concluded that vegetarian children grow at least as well as non-vegetarian children.*

*Women of childbearing age, especially pregnant women, also face additional risks. Ann Pederson of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that vegetarian women have an increase chance of irregular menstruation. Nine of the study?s 34 vegetarians missed periods, as compared to 2 of the 41 non-vegetarians. The groups were indistinguishable in regards to height, weight, and age at the beginning of menstruation. Pregnant vegetarians must take precautions against inadequate caloric intake, which can lead to low birth weight. In addition, low Vitamin B12 levels in many vegetarians can become very dangerous during pregnancy.*

TL;DR;

Veganism is the most dangerous, but even simple vegetarianism can lead to vitamin B12 and D, calcium, iron and copper deficiencies, rickets, lowered bone density, and other problems later in life.

These fads are like most other bad things ... safe enough for normal healthy bodies, but unsafe for kids, the elderly and pregnant women. And if you force your kids to be vegetarian, you are probably condeming them to health problems in their 40s to 60s, despite your ""new-age wisdom"" that we are not omnivores.",0,1336223308,null,0,false,0,c4kdtnm,t3_t86xm,t1_c4kdtnm,t1_c4kdoh7,null,1428861803,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,anudeglory,eng-devon,Devon,"&gt;At least 80% of halal meat sold in the UK is pre-stunned.

There is no source for your figure of 80% in that link, nor is there any mention of 80% in any of the sources mentioned in the link.

At most is says:
&gt;&gt;Studies indicate that a ***substantial*** proportion of British Halal meat comes from animals which are stunned before slaughter.

Also,
&gt;it is illegal to sell meat in the UK which isn't stunned [1] unless it's solely intended for the Muslim/Jewish communities.

The law, which is clearly stated in the accompanying pdf in your linked article, states:
&gt;&gt;One of these exemptions refers to slaughter, without the infliction of unnecessary suffering, by the Jewish method (Shechita) for the food of Jews or by the Muslim method (Halal) for the food of Muslims.

There is, however, no method or control within that law on how to decide who is a Muslim or Jew nor what constitutes a Muslim or Jewish community.

The letter sent to Jim Pace MP, indicates that there might be an implication of a break in the law:
&gt;&gt;If they [food outlets] serve unstunned meat to customers, pupils or patients who are not 
Muslims or Jews they are to ***some degree*** implicated in the unlawful slaughter 
without stunning of animals that are not being slaughtered to supply food for Muslims 
or Jews

My emphasis, 'to some degree implicated', is far from being illegal. There is of course no implication here that any Muslim or Jewish community, or non-specific religious or otherwise stockist, may on purpose supply meat from a non-stunned source.

But;
&gt;&gt;**This law is designed to ensure that meat from animals that have not been pre-stunned does not reach the general market** for consumption by non-Muslim and non-Jewish communities. **We have recently written to the Minister of State at Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) Jim Paice MP calling for the law to be upheld** so that meat from unstunned animals is not sold or served to the general public but only to Muslims and Jews.

Again, my emphasis - clearly there is some concern that the law is not being upheld!

&gt;If you've ever eaten halal meat it's been stunned.

&gt;basically, every bit of good british nature documentary in the past 50+ years is down to him. he either featured it in, produced it, or oversaw it, if not all 3. he does far more than just voice them, and is largely responsible for the BBC producing such awesome wildlife shows for most of that time. he's also responsible for bringing snooker to tv, and basically defining the whole character of the BBC2 channel since 1970 to now. he'd be in charge of the BBC by now but he resigned to go back to making TV shows.

&gt;he's also in his 80s, and is still making amazing wildlife shows, and travelling around the world to do it.

&gt;In my opinion he's directly responsible for bring the most amazing and beautiful parts of the planet to generations of people, and there really is no replacement (seriously, the BBC keep trying, but no-one else they have has got his enthusiasm or love for the natural world).

true,DSQ,scot-Lothian,Edinburgh,"&gt;I just keep hearing this ""multicultural"" word being thrown around without anyone ever bothering to stop and explain to me what it means. 

I feel I am in a unque position to anwser this question because I'm mixed race (Afro Caribbean Scottish and I grew up in Scotland in case you were wondering) and so I suppose my family life is what you would call multicultural. 

Basicley my understanding is that saying Britain is multicultural isn't saying we arn't British or English and Welsh and Scottish and Northan Irish any more because we are, but saying that we won't be mega upset if someone desides to make sure their children still know how to speak Urdu even if it is unlikey they will ever live in a place where that is the main language or that they still celebrait Passover. 

It just means that people don't have to drop everything that has made them who they are in order to be British. Sure everyone has to change a bit to fit into a new country, that goes without saying, but you don't have to pretend to like tea. This is a frivolis example but I hope you understand my meaning. People have been intergrating into British culture and bringing interesting things from there home culture to become apart of British culture for years but with the new media we are more highly aware of it and of represtenting all types of britains.

That said the media's policy of shoehorning in diversity in the most awkward way isn't ideal:

&gt;so when I see a group like that that's just unrecognisably diverse - that's ""four times as diverse"" as I'd expect amongst a statistically average group of friends in the pub, I do think ""hmmmn… aren't they ramming it down my throat a bit?"" And it turns out that Samir Shah, a member of the BBC's board of directors, and Sarita Malik (academic in Media, Sociology and Communications) seen to agree.

So I can kinda agree with you here. However I don't think things like the casting in Survivors is done to try and tell you what too think but because we have seen in the past that left on it's own the media behind the scenes and the casting does underepresent ethic minorties, but not just ethnic minories but also the working class and any walk of life that isn't like the type of person who is most likely to be hired at the BBC like Samir Shah said:

&gt;""Despite 30 years of trying, the upper reaches of our industry, the positions of real creative power in British broadcasting, are still controlled by a metropolitan, largely liberal, white, middle-class, cultural elite - and, until recently, largely male and largely Oxbridge.

But the fact the diverseness of the country isn't strickly represented in the BBC offices shouldn't be a problem for talented showrunners and producers (also it is pretty much impossable) because they *should* buy the scripts off and cast only the best people for the job. However that is often not the case and if left on it's own TV especially often - by accident or not - massively underrepresent the cutlure of pretty much everyone who doesn't live in London. I remember in the 90's knowing more about what the school children in London were in to or were talking about than I sometime what was going on in my own School in Edinburgh. 

So it is less about race or trying to control what people think and more about lazyness. Until resently almost all of the BBC accept small offices and studios for the news was based in London so it was just easier to source talent from the city. London is big but it has less people living in it than the rest of the UK.

Bringing it back to race it is true that ethnic minority roles in British film and TV is very underepresented and often when there are non white role they are written as [insert race here] first rather than people meaning they are crap characters. Again comming from the article you linked to:

&gt;And how often has the writer been so culturally out-of-touch or terrified about criticisms of stereotyping that they forgot to make the ethnic minority into a fully rounded character?

When it comes down to it tokenism is annoying an should be avoided but until the media get their own ranks in order (because trust me when I say the lack of diversity isn't for lack of trying to be hired by the underepresented) it looks like tokenism is here to stay and it makes me sad because it is people like you and I who suffer. (that is if we wanna work in film or TV and I do xD)

You because tokenism could mean you would lose out on a job you were the best person for and me because I'm a Black Caribbean Scottish woman with a thick scottish accent who doesn't fit in any sterotypicle 'ethic minorty' mold.

By trying to promote ""diversity"" you are actually drawing more attention to peoples differences. And you're essentially singling out certain groups and labeling them as the ones who ""need help"" to be equal to white people. That is FAR more racist.

I don't think it's a surprise that most people in UK TV shows are white. I mean, the UK is a majority white country. It's not a coincidence that most TV shows in Thailand have Thai people, or most Bollywood shows have Indian people. It's not racist for shows to reflect reality in their demographics.

But by shoving a ton of minorities into a show and then going ""OMG LOOK THIS ACTOR IS A BLACK GUY"" and making extra effort to include him and paint him in a non-sterotypical way, you're actually being more racist than if you just treated him like any other person. It's also insulting to the audience to treat us like morons who can't see through this, especially when the BBC has written policies to try and include as many minorities as possible.

The best way to end racism is to stop drawing lines between us all. Yes, sometimes you want a person of a certain colour to play a certain role. That's fine.

It may be in the mouth, the stomach, the gut or, if it goes so far as to pass through all of those, it must get through the liver, which is key in the body's regulation system. Simply put, eat testosterone and you do not absorb testosterone.

As for the claim regarding adrenaline, the website you have linked to describes neither adrenaline nor epinephrine. As such, you have misinterpreted the information given to you.

Whilst eating meat may be bad for (yet so, so delicious), it has nothing to do with how much fear, exercise or manliness the animal experiences before dying.

&gt;The law states that you need to be covered by a TV Licence if you watch or record television programmes, on any device, as they're being shown on TV. This includes TVs, computers, mobile phones, games consoles, digital boxes and Blu-ray/DVD/VHS recorders.

&gt;**You don't need a licence if you don't use any of these devices to watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV - for example, if you use your TV only to watch DVDs or play video games, or you only watch ‘catch up’ services like BBC iPlayer or 4oD.**

The piece of legislation you want is the Communications Act 2003, section 4
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/part/4 

Basically, they deliberately made the wording confusing by saying that you need a license to ""install and use"" TV equipment. But that comes down to the definition of ""install"" and ""use."" Notice that it does not say ""own"". You can own whatever equipment you like without needing a license.

""Use"" is meaning to receive *LIVE* tv as it is being broadcast. Using your TV for any other purpose to watch a video, a DVD, play Xbox or whatever is absolutely fine. You can even watch a TV show, as long as you didn't record it live.

""Install"" is more complicated, and I don't remember the exact meaning because it is in another subsection. It's to do with connecting your TV to a viable source or signal like an aerial. But the point is that you don't need a license if you only own the equipment. 

Wiki gave me this:
&gt;The BBC have stated that a licence is not needed simply because a television receiver is owned.

And their source is FOI request:
http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/foi/classes/disclosure_logs/rfi20080234_tv_licence_requirement_question.pdf

Eating meat pretty obviously means killing some cute animals. And I don't see why anybody thought supplying enough meat to feed 60 million people would be ""nice"". It's a production line, and it's designed to be fast and efficient. 

I don't agree with animal cruelty or support their suffering in any way, but the reality is that we are killing the animal for food. I think whether it gets a bolt to the head or strung up with a slit throat in those last few minutes is fairly irrelevant, and it shouldn't weigh on your decision to eat meat or not.

In my line of work (scientist) I have visited slaughterhouses, and honestly I wasn't surprised by anything. At the end of the day, it's a factory for killing animals on a mass scale. It isn't ever going to be nice. If hearing about animals being lifted up by their back legs and being distressed (right before they are killed) is a shocker for you, you were hopelessly naive before.

A few years back I pirated a Paramore album, then went on to buy them all and take 5 people to their concert. Of course, this is an exception, but without fanmade Youtube videos/torrents I'd still think they're a shit band with a cute singer.

Another example is Steam. Steam is massive for a number of reasons, but the overarching theme is the amount of market research they've clearly done. We as gamers were sick of needing to buy new CDs every time the old one got scratched, so they did away with that and made it **easy** to both buy and maintain games. Netflix, Amazon and iTunes are other examples of how listening to the consumer is the best way forward.

If I want to buy a song/movie and my options are buying it from Amazon and downloading it in seconds, or having to buy an entire album that I won't listen to, for a price I don't want to pay, and on top of that I have to go out and buy it from a store, it's obvious which I'll pick. When the buying process is made easy, we're far more likely to actually buy things. That really is as simple as it gets.

Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe (yeah, I'm not too proud to admit I love this song) has sold about 24,000 copies online in the last 24 hours. Making 1,000 sales an hour just by having a website is an absoutely incredible return. Why other companies can't see this is a mystery, but all digital media should be this **easy** for me to pick up.

I would rather make Terry turn and run with Suarez then let him just get into an aerial battle with Carroll.

That being said, I expect to see Carroll at some point.  If we are behind he is the natural choice but even if we are leading he might come on because of what he can do defending set pieces.  That's actually my biggest fear with this lineup; that we won't be able to deal with Terry and Ivanovic on set pieces.

I personally think making voting compulsory is a step in the wrong direction, we should be doing more to make people *want* to vote rather than *have* to vote.

It's basically set around the premise of two universes which are the same but a little bit different, kinda like Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel...except done a lot better and for most of the series. The actors who play two totally different versions of the same characters are brilliant and the scene in the 2nd to latest one with two versions of the same characters was brilliantly done. Could rival Micky Vs Ricky any day.

There's only **one** story that focuses on time travel though and it does skimp on one or two fairly important things (like two versions of yourself in the same place) but makes up for that in thinking of other bits. It does go into alternate realities and alternate timelines a fair bit elsewhere though.

I believe they age at the rate of a normal human, they simply live past where a human would normally die, so I'd say the first Doctor was really only around 72 when he first regenerated. But then thus is contradicted by Matt Smith, whom in the first episode ages 200 years withou looking a day older. They may only age by outside interference, and therefor, can only be killed or forced to regenerate by outside causes. Counter evidence to THAT is when we see the master looking into the time vortex, he looks like a child.

Without a warrant they have no right whatsoever to come in.

They might turn up at your door, and they start to bullshit you, asking if they can see and check for a TV. They make it sound like it isn't a big deal. ""Just let us pop in and have a quick look so we can stop bothering you."" Stand your ground and tell them to leave immediately. This is your property, and they have no right to be there.

The ONLY way that they can legally come in without your consent is if they have a search warrant. And this is highly unlikely. In order to get a search warrant they need to go to a judge with reasonable evidence that you are breaking the law. That means they need to show evidence to a judge that you are watching live TV. I'm sure you can appreciate how unlikely and how difficult that is. Simply showing that you have a TV is not enough evidence to get a warrant.

I'm not a lawyer and I'm not suggesting that you lie to them, but if you genuinely don't watch live TV, just tell them to get lost. They have no right whatsoever to harass you. 

They wrote me letters. I told them I didn't watch live TV. Then they said they would send someone to check. I wrote and told them that they would be wasting their time. They sent somebody anyway.

&gt;encouraging producers/directors to hire people of colour

Sorry but how is that NOT racist behaviour? Selecting for or against somebody because of their race IS racist. How about hiring people because of their acting talent? Or because that's what the viewers want?

And of course these policies draw lines between us. We are all people. But you're not longer characterising minorities like the rest of us. As soon as you label them, you're creating division. With these policies you are actually singling them out and saying ""these are the people who need help, so be extra nice to them"". That's incredibly racist and offensive!

If I was a minority I would be pretty pissed off that we had to have a policy made saying that people should make more effort to include me. Are you saying that I can't cope on my own? Why should I be any different to anybody else? My Pakistani-English friend says the same.. he doesn't want special treatment, and he always cringes at the token ""brown person"" on TV. And it's insulting to suggest that one group of people needs some help so that they aren't under-represented.

The fact is that the least racist thing to do is to NOT KEEP TALKING ABOUT RACE and to just let people be people. As soon as you decide that black people need to be more represented, you are saying that they are worse than white people and couldn't ever get on TV based on their own merits. That is stupid, and racist.

Also, I haven't really seen any proof of anybody being under-represented in the first place. According to the 2001 census, the UK is 91% white, about 2% brown and about 2% black. If I had to guess, I would say that according to that, black and brown people are certainly well represented on TV. Off the top of my head I can think of numerous news readers, sports commentators, radio personalities etc who fit those descriptions. And I'm sure any of them would be annoyed if you told them that they got the job because the BBC was encouraging diversity. I'm sure they'd be happier that they were chosen because of their talent.",0,1336240047,null,0,false,0,c4kg4af,t3_t7r71,t1_c4kg4af,t1_c4kfudv,null,1428862862,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That puts them ahead of most other people who don't give a shit and whatever, whenever and most of us are fat, overweight and lazy.

That said, I know some vegetarians who eat like total shit. Tons of bread, pasta and other empty carbohydrates. And they make up their fat with tons of cheese on everything. I'd bet that they are no better off than people who eat meat when it comes to cancer.

He's busy trying to stop the war and then he discovers that Susan has somehow gotten tangled up in it, and has been killed by the Daleks.

The Doctor then turns and begins to fight the Time War, eventually becoming a general of some sort, to avenge his granddaughter. Then he finds out that it was really the Time Lords all along who'd do anything to get the great and powerful Doctor into the fight, just moments before the Time Lords kill him as well, forcing his regeneration.

The new Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) emerges, hatches a plan to seal the Time War forever, and enacts it in the thrilling climax of the movie. Following that, he's trying to figure out what to do next, and discovers that a species called the Nestene Consiousness had been allies of the Daleks in the Time War, and had escaped to hide on 2005 Earth.

We were much better with Carroll in the lineup, who looked very dangerous.  Suarez and Carroll are starting to understand each other now, and are gelling pretty well as a strike team.

We've got to bring in some additional personnel this summer - at the very least a striker and a right-winger, and I'd like to have a backup left-back, another left winger and, again, cover for Lucas that's not Spearing.

2. Drogba is a fucking cunt and I hate everything about him. The diving, the bitching, the time wasting. I couldn't stand it. Despite being as talented as he is, I have absolutely no respect for that piece of trash. He's a disgrace to the game in my book.

3. That ""goal"". Should've been counted. If FIFA don't implement goal-line technology, then they're fucking high and out of their minds. We got robbed.

4. Carroll should have started. That man was fantastic and played like a man possessed. 

5. Daniel Agger (or was it Henderson? I forget) Fucking stood like a deer in headlights in the box when he could have run up to the ball and had a shot (I forget when specifically but it was late in the second half...off a rebound). Incredibly frustrating.

Unfortunately Bellamy didn't have a good game which is uncharacteristic of him, Spearing was terrible and it shows how much we need Lucas.

Gerrard had an average game, Henderson was meh.

Carroll had an excellent game, working hard up front and coming back on defense, I've given him a lot of shit this season but the past 2 months he has really surprised me. I think next year he will have a very respectable goal scoring tally.

Our defense wasn't bad at all, except we should not have been caught with out pants down for that first goal. Drogba's goal was just a good play by him, nothing anyone can do.

By losing the FA Cup the season is now a failure. The silver lining is that management will need to take a good long hard look at the team and see where changes need to be made, because there needs to be changes if we are to not be the laughing stock of the premier league next year.

In my personal opinion I don't think Dalglish is the man for the job. I do love the man, but I don't think he is that great of a manager. There are a lot of very good managers out on the open market right now, but I suppose that discussion is for another day.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"Was absolutely disgusted with that first half performance, we started off too cagey, no urgency in our attack, Suarez was too isolated and Downing was god awful. Nobody showed any bit of heart except Agger.

Starting off the second half, it was much of the same until Carroll came on and did brilliantly for his goal. What's sickening is that Carroll could have been brought on half time, the way we played in the first half clearly wasn't working and we needed more of a threat. After the goal we started to get back into it but it was too late, that performance in the first half cost us the game.

* Reina was poor, thought he should have done much better to stop the first goal
* Skrtel and Agger showed heart, can't fault them really.
* Johnson was decent going forward
* Gerrard was below par, I expected more tbh. 
* Bellamy was poor, as was Spearing.
* Downing and Enrique were awful, they don't look like they're on the same wavelength at all(and its not the only time I've noticed this).  
* Suarez wasn't his usual self (wasn't getting much help in the first half) 
*Carroll was great when he came on, he shook up the Chelsea defense and showed he had heart, moreso than most other players

Was the ball over the line? No, I don't think so. The ball has to fully cross the line for it to count and it looked like it didn't, linesman can't give unless hes fully sure.

I think Kenny's time may be up, the goal for this season was to get to the Champions League and he failed to do so. A League Cup win and an F.A Cup final is not going to paper over our dreadful performance in the league and there's a very real possibility we could end up below tenth place.

Next year Liverpool hope to be challenging in four competitions; depth is going to be an important issue.  All successful clubs have problems with injuries, but they find ways to use their depth and succeed despite it.  (This is why I hope we only sell players this summer who *want* to leave.  We are going to need the depth)

Spearing should *not* have started this match.  Just no way, no how.  All season long he has struggled with one-on-one defending, passing (all aspects), and I have never seen him win a ball in the air.  Yet, he was stuck right in the middle of the park in a position that is supposed to dictate play both ways!  Carroll has been in form lately, Kuyt has a history of big goals in big games, and I am sure people are going to clamor that Maxi deserved a chance too.

(Side Note:  I know a lot of people are upset Carroll didn't get more time, but you never know how he would have played as a starter.

Look at Spurs and the progress they've made. Their reserve holding midfielders are the likes of Sandro and Huddlestone.

Modric should not play behind the main striker or on the wings.  He's the guy that collects the ball deep and dictates play.  He's far less effective when he's not sitting in the middle getting the ball.

vdV is an ideal second striker. He's good enough to play anywhere in midfield or up front, but he's the guy with the technique and football brains to provide that killer one-touch pass or creativity in the final 3rd. 

Bale of course is great at running at defenders.   We've seen he's not nearly as effective coming inside.  Maybe he can bring that into his game, but when he abandon's the left wing, we lose a big threat in our attack.   

Lennon not playing has also really affected us by pushing vdV or Modric out wide where they're not effective but also we lose that quality in the center.  We could really have used Corluka playing RB and Walker RMF in those situations.

Then you'll have multiple threads all posted at the same time and who is in the wrong?

I can't help but feel that the whole ""terrorism"" thing is overblown anyway. I fear that we are catching the American disease of being super paranoid and going all mental again.

I mean seriously, the amount of security for flying is absolutely insane, and I can't understand why. What's special about a plane? There is zero security in trains, buses, shopping centers, market squares or hundreds of other areas where people gather. So why I need to be irradiated, stripped and have my mouthwash and my girlfriends nail scissors confiscated before flying?

And let's be honest, even if we made planes 100% terrorist proof, that won't stop terrorism. They would just use a different target. All that security does nothing to address underlying issues about WHY people want to kill us and destroy our way of live.

If terrorists really WERE out to get us in the numbers that the government would have us believe, why are there almost no attacks? I really can't believe that we are so amazing at stopping them. It really isn't that difficult to cause domestic terrorism if you were so inclined. You could cover a big 4x4 in ""allah akbar"" or whatever and plow it through a pedestrian area. Or you could throw concrete blocks off motorway bridges. Instant effect. Instant news coverage. Highly repeatable. You could carry it out every single day for months with almost no resources. Public panic would be massive. Way of life disrupted. It delivers your terrorist message. Terrorism achieved. Yet I still can't take my hair gel on a plane.

Well for a start, directing MPs to websites that refer to the proponents of these measures as ""religious fanatics"" is likely to at best, have no impact at all - and at worst it'll paint people in such a light as to detract from any meaningful viewpoint they might wish to express.

The PM is supposed to be meeting with representatives from various major ISPs in the near future - they should be able to explain to him the technical argument as to why such a scheme would be the wrong avenue to pursue - but as individuals? I'd advocate the following:

**Find out who your local MP is**. You can use [this website](http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/) - just punch in your post code and it'll bring up the details of your ""elected representative"". Clicking their name will take you to a page with their details - when they were elected to office, what percentage of the vote they scored - and more importantly, contact details for 'em - typically a website and an email address.

**Send 'em an email.**

It doesn't have to be war and peace - just something outlining your concerns in as neutral a tone as possible. Below is a rough first draft - suffice to say it needs reeling in a little [I tend to write long, then dial it back in when editing], but the general ""jist"" of the counter-position is there, I think.


**Dear Mr Kelly,**

[Because as I found out from that website, my MP is to be addressed as Mr. Kelly, as opposed to Dear Chris""].

I write to your as my MP, in reference to the Governments' Planned public consultation on the issue of introducing additional safeguards, to prevent children from accessing content of an adult nature - namely pornography - on the internet.

Such measures being put forward for the public's' views include a so-called ""Opt In"" scheme. This scheme / system, which is favoured by some campaigners, would see Internet Service Providers [herein referred to as ISPs] be forced to block access to ""inappropriate adult content"" by default, with customers having to register their interest in viewing said content, either when they sign-up for an internet service, or later on.

Proponents of this measure believe, in good faith, that it will prevent young children and impressionable young adults, from accessing material that isn't appropriate for them. Not only do I personally disagree, I believe such measures actually have the potential to cause more damage than potentially envisioned - that by introducing measures that are designed to prevent children and young adults accessing these types of material, that it might simply serve to draw their attention towards them.

Hence my reason for writing to you.

Simply ""blocking"" access to information has been shown in the past to be highly ineffective - due to the nature of it's inception, the internet has been said, much like life, to ""find a way"" - indeed, due to the very nature of both the underlying technology upon which the modern internet is built, and the ""surface level"" - i.e webpages that we browse, the internet as a system is designed to facilitate the distribution of information, even if parts are broken - which measures such as those being proposed would do - they would, in affect, ""break the internet"" for users.

For an example of how blocking access to content has been shown to backfire, allow me to draw your attention to the recent High Court ruling, that required all UK based Internet Service Providers to block access to a well known file sharing website, on the basis that said site was facilitating the distribution of copyrighted materials. Starting this week, ISPs have started complying with this court order and ""blocking"" access to the site.

Which, if you follow the logic as put forward in the High Court judgement, should mean that the website is no longer accessible to users, and that the copyright infringement levelled at it, has ceased.

It has been reported this week that since the High Court judgement was handed down, the site has seen an additional twelve **million** users access it - in other words, by raising the profile of the site, it has only encouraged more people to use it.

The same thing will happen, if this proposed ""Opt In"" scheme were to be introduced, with regards to adult content [in this instance, pornography]. Children are naturally inquisitive, and are prone to testing the boundries of what they can and can't ""get away"" with - if they find out that a certain website is ""out of bounds"" - a website they might not have known about previously - what's to say they might not try to circumvent the ""block"".

Which as any I.T. professional - or your average Pirate Bay user will tell you, will be ridiculously easy. In order to realistically introduce a blanket ""ban"" on anything - sites that infringe copyright laws, extremist websites that espouse hateful vitriolic notions, or - in this case - access to pornography, it would necessitate the introduction of a national ""Firewall"" that would rival the system in place in communist states such as the Peoples Republic of China, and North Korea.

I'm sure you'd agree, that's not a list the United Kingdom should be joining anytime soon - countries that devote countless resources, to block, on a national level, the content its citizens can access.

Not least of all, because parents / guardians who're concerned that their child[ren] might seek out such content can block this access themselves. It doesn't require intervention from the Government for a parent to block access to certain ""types"" of website - they can do it themselves. Typically using the bundled software that came with their internet service.

The problem, it seems, is that *some* parents aren't technically ""up to speed"" to do this.

If that's the case, surely the solution lies in education, rather than attempting to block something, and hope it goes away?

What better barometer is there, when it comes to judging what a child is ready for, than their own parents? It strikes me that this already happens across a variety of other areas:

For instance, we have a legal age at which people can buy - and consume, alcohol. And yet if a parent decides their child can have a small sip of wine with their Sunday dinner, that's seen as OK.

The same applies with films - 12A films can be seen by children under the age of 12, *provided their parent deems them mature enough* - and emotionally capable of understanding what they're watching, and the context.

Surely the same view should be taken when it comes to pornography. Educate parents how to filter the sites their child[ren] can access - and when they decide certain types of site are appropriate, allow that access.

Otherwise - were an ""opt in"" or ""blanket ban"" type system introduced - what would be to stop a child going to a friends house, whose parents have decided to opt in?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Your Faithfully,

true,Pizza401,wight,United States of America,"&gt; Guns do not solve all problems, especially if you wake to find yourself being violently attacked.

You don't just ""wake to find yourself being violently attacked"" inside your own home. If you secure your home properly, an intruder is going to make tons of noise and take a bit of time breaking in. If you've got a holstered handgun on the nightstand with a round in the chamber, I think it's very unlikely an intruder would get the ""upper hand"" on you.

As a homeowner, you have a huge ""home court advantage"" over a nighttime intruder if you're armed. You know the layout of your home perfectly, you know roughly where the intruder is from their moving footsteps, you're operating under the assumption they're armed, your eyes are already adjusted to the darkness, and most importantly you have time on your side. You can just remain in a dark corner of your bedroom with your weapon covering the door until police arrive; in contrast an intruder is going to be more reckless, moving as quickly as possible knowing that police may be on the way. They don't know the layout of your home, they don't know where you are inside the home or if you're even awake, they don't know if you have a dog, and they don't know if you're armed. You could be silently waiting with a loaded shotgun around any dark corner.

An intruder is also going to be a bit more hesitant to shoot, giving you yet another advantage; if they shoot and kill you, they're getting the death penalty... if you shoot and kill them, the police are going to give you a pat on the back once they arrive.",0,1336261085,null,0,false,0,c4kjmte,t3_t7ife,t1_c4kjmte,t1_c4kj0zd,null,1428864584,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.

Arsenal Football Club started out as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London, and was renamed Royal Arsenal shortly afterwards.[4] The club was renamed again to Woolwich Arsenal after becoming a limited company in 1893.[5] The club became the first southern member of the Football League in 1893, starting out in the Second Division, and won promotion to the First Division in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall.[6] Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, North London; they dropped ""Woolwich"" from their name the following year.[7] Arsenal only finished in fifth place in 1919, but were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, by reportedly dubious means.[8]

true,anudeglory,eng-devon,Devon,"&gt;[1] According to the RSPCA it's 93%.

Well, they can't even cite the source properly - They cite ""DIAREL"" when it should be ""DIA**L**REL"" - the source being [this](http://www.dialrel.eu/images/factsheet-assesment-practices.pdf) [pdf] document. And the figure the RSPCA report is only for small ruminants not cattle or poultry.

Moreover, their report states:
&gt;&gt;The data collected from competent authorities and abattoirs in this survey may not constitute a true 
representation of the ritual slaughter practices in the EU and surveyed countries because of the **low 
number of questionnaires returned**

More worringly, data from ""competent authorities"" does not mention the UK
&gt;&gt; [data] in 2006 was provided by the competent authorities of Germany (DE), Italy (IT), Spain (ES), Australia (AU) and Israel (IL)

Looking at Shechita - the Jewish method of killing - they found that.
&gt;&gt; Data on Shechita practices were received from France, Italy, Spain,** the UK,** Australia, and Israel. In 
**all** the abattoirs surveyed, **cattle, small ruminants and poultry** were slaughtered **without stunning**

Further in their report, a report from **some** abattoirs you can see it [here](http://www.dialrel.eu/images/factsheet-assesment-practices.pdf) - page three -, mentions that **only 74%** of cattle were pre-stunned, 93.2% of small ruminants and 100% of chickens were pre-stunned.

Nowhere does it state, a) how many abattoirs are in the UK, b) how many abattoirs were surveyed, and c) how many of the abattoirs returned results!

[Desperately worrying](http://www.dialrel.eu/images/factsheet-market-uk.pdf):
&gt;&gt;There are no official statistics on religious slaughter, but in 2007 it was estimated that 114 million animals were slaughtered annually in the UK using halal methods.

Shockingly, the source for that figure is an article in the Independent newspaper! Post DIALREL's study from 2006!

&gt;I don't know why you've quoted the part about religious slaughter being excepted from stunning, of course this is true. In practise though, almost all halal meat is stunned.

Because, wading through the shockingly bad statistics and data on the subject, it seems that there are massive methodological flaws in their data collections and summaries.

Thus, I cannot - with good conscience - trust that any potential Halal and certainly not a Shechita source of animal meat has been definitely pre-stunned before slaughter.

true,Hishutash,null,null,"&gt; What a ridiculous statement. So, because some white people in the past have committed attrocities (completely unrelated to modern terrorism targeting air travel) then the white old lady must be an evil terrorist?

What do you mean in the past? The biggest group of mass murders on the planet currently are Anglos/Wasps (not simply ""white people"" you bigot). The Anglo culture has consistently been one of the most violent cultures to have ever existed. So a mass murder and terrorist is more likely to be white Anglo person than some Asian dude.

&gt; Also, yes, the IRA has killed more people than Muslim terrorists. But the IRA is practically non-exist and inactive at the moment. It's absurd and ridiculous to say that because other groups have been bad in the past, we must act like they still are.

Doesn't change anything. Muslims are statistically much less likely to commit terrorism than any other groups in the west:

http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/01/not-all-terrorists-are-muslims/

http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/01/terrorism-in-europe/

&gt; Statistically speaking, no the white old lady is not more likely to blow up a plane than a young Asian man, and you are mentally deficient if you think otherwise.

Statistically speaking the old white English lady is much more likely to be a mass-murderous psychopathic terrorist than the young Asian man. It's because of her upbringing in a violent, barbaric culture. 

Contrary to PC lemmings, not all cultures are same. Some cultures happen to be much more ruthless and inhuman than others. British culture (English culture in particular) is among the worst in that regard.

true,laxguy,present,John Terry,"Honestly, the number of repeat posts and fragmented threads has really disuaded me from posted in the past few weeks. Granted, I haven't been here that long, I think I subscribed around Christmas time, but even then it was more manageable and I was able to have multiple discussions about things at once without jumping between threads and repeating myself. 

Personally, I don't mind threads for goals and such AS LONG AS there aren't multiple for the same event. As happy as I was for Torres after the Barca game and the QPR game, I really had no desire to post or talk about it because there were 15 threads about the same thing with different people talking in each and everyone repeating the same thing. 

My final two cents: Pre and Post match threads are plenty, with occasional posts about major events. I like the pre-match threads because it allows me to gauge what people are thinking and the general feel about the match. A few times SG has put up the post-match thread early and I feel that's where most of the discussion of game play/events should take place.

While you could carry on a low level brick throwing campaign if it was sustained you'd get caught fairly quickly, after all it doesn't take a substantial amount of effort to put people on bridges with flash lights and if it went on for long enough (daily incidents for a week, maybe 2) you wouldn't even need the state to organize it, people would just start doing it. 

A car driven into a pedestrian area would work, but your only going to kill a few people doing that. And importantly, you would be caught pretty quickly because you won't die, so you can be made to talk. A 2008 Mumbai style attack would be more effective, but automatic weapons are hard to get hold of, the armed police are better in the UK and the country is small enough to bring in the military or special forces far more quickly if they can't handle it. And high profile targets would be guarded. And as with bombings, the security forces are looking for this type of thing. At most, you'd probably kill 10-20 people.

But with a plane, not only can I kill 50-600 people instantly by crashing it or blowing it out of the sky, I can use the thing like a missile and take out a high profile target without worrying about the police, the army, snipers, road blocks etc, any of the things that would make a car bomb hard to do. And I can do far more damage to whatever it is I hit. Time it well and you could go from eating peanuts in business class to impacting Parliament in less time than it would take to get an interceptor into the air, let along find out why it's veering off course, visually confirming there are no problems (engine fault, bird strike etc) and deciding to shoot it down.

Long time listener, first time caller...

My seat was almost directly in line with the goal line (on the opposite side from the camera in the gif) and it looked over the line from where I was. 

What's more, my decision is final.  :)

Whilst I'm at it... Our formation at the start was all wrong. Bellers and Downing playing as flanking forwards looking to cross to... who? Luis? Spearing making forward runs into the box? We didn't have anyone winning headers anywhere on the pitch let alone in the box. Having two wingers looking to play up the pitch meant a midfield of 3 which was swamped. When we've played like this against Chelsea before we did so with 3 at the back which meant 4 in the middle. 4 at the back yesterday. No chance. 

The game changed entirely with Carroll on - Luis had support, 4 in midfield started to win more of the ball and there was a connection between midfield and attack. It wasn't just ""half an hour to go let's start playing"" - it was the change of formation. 

In the end, having suffered for most of the first hour or so, we all felt like at least there was some play worth getting excited about in the final half hour or so. 

Oh, and the highlight of the day was before the game - 3 loads of Chelsea fans had hired open top buses to go to the game (cocky gits). But they all had to pass under the Wembley walkway - and they all got covered in beer from reds fans as they did. That shut them up, I can tell you!

&gt;It often sounds so noble when someone says they are trying to ""cure"" cancer... Oh the irony. Germany has recently banned GMO corn because of the Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium that the toxin producing genes it contains. Which by some coincidence is directly related to the research you are doing. 

Huh????? Source on that one please, I am genuinely interested if that is the reason they have banned GMO corn and asking for a source in that light. 


Sigh. Ok I will do a quick Bt 101 in the spirit of being a good scientist, and because it makes it easier to refer back to if you start spouting your shite about me elsewhere on the net. 

* *Bacillus thuringiensis* is a spore forming gram positive bacteria that exists naturally in our environment. It is usually found on plant leaves, but also in soil, dusty areas and some swampy areas. Basically everywhere, if you dug about in your back garden you would find some. 

* When if forms a spore, (endospore) it makes a protein crystal, contained within the spore. This crystal is a toxin, when the spore is eaten by an insect larvae on a leaf, the toxin attaches to a cell receptor on the epithelial lining of the midgut of the insect larvae. The rest of the spore is the genetic information needed for the bacteria to 'wake up' and start multiplying again. The toxin forms a pore in the gut lining, effectively stopping the insect from eating in its tracks. The bacteria leave through the pore in the gut wall, into the blood stream where they are haemolytic and start multiplying prolifically. This is what finally finishes the larvae off as well as the starvation. 

* The dead larva is what the Bt use to multiply and grown on, when there are no nutrients left, they sporulate and the whole process is ready to start again. 

* There are many different strains of Bt, each producing toxins that kill a wide variety of insects, beetles, mosquitoes, or the strain we worth with with kills [Diamondback moths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamondback_moth) *Plutella xylostella*. The toxin does not effect humans, we do not have the same receptors in our gut lining for the toxin to attach to. Therefore our bodies treat it like any other bit of protein we eat, and degrades it down. 

* Bt has been used for decades by farmers, both normal and organic as a way of controlling pests in their crops, it has been applied directly as a bacterial application, and as an application only containing whichever toxin is applicable for that crop and that pest. 

* This toxin, like all proteins is encoded by a gene, what biotech companies like Monsanto did, was to put the gene that encodes this toxin directly into the plant genome, so instead of having to spray crops with either a chemical pesticide, or organic Bt one, the toxin was already expressed there in the plant, so as soon as the insect took a bite, it was killed off. 

* There are some forms of Bt that produce a crystal toxin, but that toxin does not have any insecticidal activity, they are called parasporins. We actually have no idea why they exist, or how they have evolved, but we can speculate that they are 'cheats' in that they are eaten at the same time as the spore of the insecticidal strain, and cheat by using the insect cadaver to multiply on as normal. 

* These parasporin crystals have been found to preferentially kill cancer cells, in our case HeLa cells, while leaving healthy cells alone. Again we do not know why ( which is why we and others are researching it) but we speculate it is a mutated receptor on the cancer cell allowing the toxin to bind, that is not present on healthy epithelial cells. 

* The toxins, as they are discovered are given different nomenclature, because they are all very similar in structure. We have Cry1A, Cry1Ab, Cry1ac etc because their effects are all different but there are literally hundreds of them listed. Therefore, when you see Monsanto referenced or listed, it will be because they have used a toxin that has a similar structure, or from the same toxin family, or from the same strain as one that is being discussed in that paper. That is not uncommon for a scientific paper. It is also not uncommon for the same people to have worked on toxins that Monsanto, or any other company use in the past. They are scientists who work on Bt, it is their area of research whether that be an insecticidal strain or a parasporin strain. 

&gt;Like i said do your research you ignorant and belligerent ass of a human being. 

You are the one who is ignorant, your above post has demonstrated that. You have NO idea how science works or how people in that field of study work. You do not have any other argument other than Monsanto is bad, well yeah, Monsanto have shitty business practices, but there are other biotech companies out there. GMO does not rest on Monsanto alone, it is only truly stupid people like yourself that insist on GM only ever being the domain of Monsanto. I do not work on GM, I work on parasporins, your above post was so desperate to try and discredit me somehow, even after I had disengaged with you, that your focus is nothing to do with outrage at GM, but a desperate desire to boost your own ego by proving someone wrong. You know what, life is way too short for that shit, and I cannot be arsed with people who are truly that ignorant. Whatever you come back with now, I suspect it will include how bad monsanto is, or how scientists cant prove something is safe, or how all want money, are being paid lots to say this by monsanto.. blah blah. If you knew how little I get paid you would know I do all this research out of pure love and fascination for my field of work, not because some mythical biotech rep is giving me backhanders.

* **Find out who your local MP is.** [You can use this website](http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/) - just punch in your post code and it'll bring up the details of your ""elected representative"". Clicking their name will take you to a page with their details - when they were elected to office, what percentage of the vote they scored - and more importantly, contact details for 'em - typically a website and an email address.

* **Send 'em an email.**

It doesn't have to be war and peace - just something outlining your concerns in as neutral a tone as possible. Below is a rough first draft - suffice to say it needs reeling in a little [I tend to write long, then dial it back in when editing], but the general ""jist"" of the counter-position is there, I think.

**Dear Name of MP**

I write to your as my MP, in reference to the Governments' Planned public consultation on the issue of introducing additional safeguards, to prevent children from accessing content of an adult nature - namely pornography - on the internet.

Such measures being put forward for the public's' views include a so-called ""Opt In"" scheme. This scheme / system, which is favoured by some campaigners, would see Internet Service Providers [herein referred to as ISPs] be forced to block access to ""inappropriate adult content"" by default, with customers having to register their interest in viewing said content, either when they sign-up for an internet service, or later on.

Proponents of this measure believe, in good faith, that it will prevent young children and impressionable young adults, from accessing material that isn't appropriate for them. Not only do I personally disagree, I believe such measures actually have the potential to cause more damage than potentially envisioned - that by introducing measures that are designed to prevent children and young adults accessing these types of material, that it might simply serve to draw their attention towards them.

*Hence my reason for writing to you.*

Simply ""blocking"" access to information has been shown in the past to be highly ineffective - due to the nature of it's inception, the internet has been said, much like life, to ""find a way"" - indeed, due to the very nature of both the underlying technology upon which the modern internet is built, and the ""surface level"" - i.e webpages that we browse, the internet as a system is designed to facilitate the distribution of information, even if parts are broken - which measures such as those being proposed would do - they would, in affect, ""break the internet"" for users.

For an example of how blocking access to content has been shown to backfire, allow me to draw your attention to the recent High Court ruling, that required all UK based Internet Service Providers to block access to a well known file sharing website, on the basis that said site was facilitating the distribution of copyrighted materials. Starting this week, ISPs have started complying with this court order and ""blocking"" access to the site.

Which, if you follow the logic as put forward in the High Court judgement, should mean that the website is no longer accessible to users, and that the copyright infringement levelled at it, has ceased.
It has been reported this week that since the High Court judgement was handed down, the site has seen an additional twelve million users access it - in other words, by raising the profile of the site, it has only encouraged more people to use it.

The same thing will happen, if this proposed ""Opt In"" scheme were to be introduced, with regards to adult content [in this instance, pornography]. Children are naturally inquisitive, and are prone to testing the boundries of what they can and can't ""get away"" with - if they find out that a certain website is ""out of bounds"" - a website they might not have known about previously - what's to say they might not try to circumvent the ""block"".

Which as any I.T. professional - or your average Pirate Bay user will tell you, will be ridiculously easy. In order to realistically introduce a blanket ""ban"" on anything - sites that infringe copyright laws, extremist websites that espouse hateful vitriolic notions, or - in this case - access to pornography, it would necessitate the introduction of a national ""Firewall"" that would rival the system in place in communist states such as the Peoples Republic of China, and North Korea.

I'm sure you'd agree, that's not a list the United Kingdom should be joining anytime soon - countries that devote countless resources, to block, on a national level, the content its citizens can access.

Not least of all, because parents / guardians who're concerned that their child[ren] might seek out such content can block this access themselves. It doesn't require intervention from the Government for a parent to block access to certain ""types"" of website - they can do it themselves. Typically using the bundled software that came with their internet service.

The problem, it seems, is that some parents aren't technically ""up to speed"" to do this.

If that's the case, surely the solution lies in education, rather than attempting to block something, and hope it goes away?
What better barometer is there, when it comes to judging what a child is ready for, than their own parents? It strikes me that this already happens across a variety of other areas:

For instance, we have a legal age at which people can buy - and consume, alcohol. And yet if a parent decides their child can have a small sip of wine with their Sunday dinner, that's seen as OK.

The same applies with films - 12A films can be seen by children under the age of 12, provided their parent deems them mature enough - and emotionally capable of understanding what they're watching, and the context.

Surely the same view should be taken when it comes to pornography. Educate parents how to filter the sites their child[ren] can access - and when they decide certain types of site are appropriate, allow that access.

Otherwise - were an ""opt in"" or ""blanket ban"" type system introduced - what would be to stop a child going to a friends house, whose parents have decided to opt in?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours Faithfully,

Dear mrs. perry

Although I am not one of you constituents I find you actions of trying to push though an 'opt in' pornography plan for the internet quite worrying and have some questions about said proposed measures.
Rightly or wrongly you have been accused of censorship over the campaign and you have made a seemingly misguided retort.
The gardian on there website claimed that you have argued that ""The internet was no different to TV and radio and should be regulated accordingly.""
I do hope that this is taken out of context because anybody who feels that the internet should be regulated in the same way as the T.V. and Radio just does not understand the internet. 
I would really like to know where you have got your conceptions about the internet and the way that it works from. Have you any technical experience in the field? Do you realise that the reason that Talk Talk is the only ISP that is in positive dialogue concerning your plans is because your views on how the internet operates are uneducated.
Now I am sure that you have received some council about how the internet works only I would be interested to know where such ideas have come from in these reacent times. In the past it does not seem as though the issue has been one of your primary concerns ever before. My fear is that you have been taken in by individuals with a private agenda. It is not an assumption just merely a question have you or have you not been persuaded propose these Opt in measures by other individuals? If so then can you please state what individuals have approached you about the matter or tell me how first you felt the issue should be adressed.

""Dear Mrs. Perry,

I am writing to you about the proposed plan to enforce a filter at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to protect children using the Internet. I have two major concerns about this plan. 

The first concern is that this plan will not prevent children, or anyone, from accessing sites blocked by the filter. This week following a court order a popular file sharing website was blocked by every major ISP in the UK. However, rather than cutting of access to the site to UK citizens it saw its number of site visits in the UK jump by 12 million. The Internet is a vast, uncontrollable global network, trying to block off a site is akin to trying to block off a city by closing a single road. Today children grow up on the Internet with computers, they will be very familiar with methods to get around such a ban (changing DNS servers, using a proxy site or a VPN etc.). In fact the presence of the filter will only act to draw attention to these sites, and add a level of challenge and excitement that will encourage children to explore the metaphorical 'forbidden fruit'.

My second major concern is that the presence of such a filter will make parents complacent about letting their children use the Internet. If you ask parents to devolve the responsibility of protecting their children online to a government body, which, as I have stated above, will be ineffective at blocking out unsuitable sites, then you will be essentially 'letting children loose' on the Internet. No one knows better how to look after a child then their parents, and supervision at the parental level is the only effective way to monitor a child's use of the Internet. 

In conclusion, I would warn that is would be dangerous to underestimate both the technical prowess of children in their use of the Internet, which will make short work of any ISP level filter, and the role of parents in supervising their children. Surely this idea of the government swooping in to take a role best left to their parents is unreconcilable with the idea of the Big Society? The answer to protecting children online is better education for children and parents. Just as children are warned about the dangers or drugs and sexual assault in we should educate them on safely using the Internet. Parents need up to date information on how their children will be using a technology that is alien to many, explaining terms like Social Network, Message Board, Instant Messaging etc.. Better education for families on living a safe life on the Internet will have a far greater effect on protecting children than an ineffective ban that will serve only as an incentive to explore.

* **The issue of impartiality.** -  As **pandorasnet** [stated here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/t8fpd/the_religious_fanatics_behind_the_tory_plans_to/c4kob85), there's an issue of neutrality to be addressed with these proposals - i.e. do the people advocating them have an agenda to push¹

* **Impact on the Economy.** - One could argue that such measures *could* have a detrimental affect on the UK economy. The economy already relies heavily on tech orientated industries - something that'll further increase as manufacturing declines due to better economies of scale in foreign countries. By essentially ""breaking the internet"" on a national scale, such measures could dissuade companies from investing in the economy, by being based here.

* **Impact on the Governments I.T. Drive.** - Initiatives like the Raspberry Pi [which I've argued won't have much affect anyway.] as well as the [much needed] revamp of the I.T. curriculum in schools, are designed to foster innovation. The aim is to create a generation of Turings, Sinclairs, Molyneuxs etc, etc. By ""fiddling around"" with the internet at the behest of people who likely don't come from a technical background, we run the risk of stunting what's already a difficult task.

¹The problem with this, is that it leaves ""us"" as individuals open to attack. By questioning if the proponents of these guidelines have an agenda to push, it would leave us open to the exact same question. Clearly, both sides - i.e. those advocating these measures, and those of us who're vehemently against them, both have a vested interest.",0,1336306346,null,0,false,0,c4kp8qa,t3_t9kqh,t1_c4kp8qa,t3_t9kqh,null,1428867227,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

**hart**: no need to do anything here. in hart we have everything we need.

**panti**: seems competent. had some problems with the rebounds but overall he cuts it. I say we sign him permanently, neither the transfer nor the contracts shouldn't cost us that much. it should also be good to have a young and hungry keeper willing to show his worth in case hart gets injured.

**taylor**: guy seems solid. doesnt complain with his role and has routine enough to probably do OK in a pinch. what more can you ask?

**transfers in**: panti.

**transfers out**: -

-----------------------------------------------

**central defenders**

**kompany**: the captain and backbone.

**lescott**: stepped up his game this season, have some improving to do in his passing-game but overall he fits there perfectly alongside vinnie.

**kolo**: seems fed-up with his situation. pretty solid but slow and past his best days, if PSG offers; let him go.

**savic**: great calm and overall he works OK, so far he hasn't played a single game without making a major error. def need some grooming there.

**boyata**: home-grown carrington product, didn't get much confidence in bolton. is he ready?

**next season**: if kolo leaves we probably need someone with top-flight experience to fill his shoes. if mancini believes savic or boyata will be ready for the starting eleven in a couple of years; bring in a 30-something to do the job for a short period of time. if not; javi martinez should be our guy, mainly a holding midfielder but has played in the defence for bilbao this seasons and done so with competence. should definitely fit our needs.

**transfers in**: javi martinez

**transfers out**: kolo toure

-----------------------------------------------

**wing backs**:

**micah**: has really gone greath lenghts this season. i barely remember the at moments shaky defender we had last year. in my opinion the absolut number one choice among the lot.

**zaba**: plays with heart and seems to always do more than he is capable of. big reason the other spanish-speaking players feel at ease in the club. solid.

**clichy**: has gone a little unnoticed, in my eyes the man of the match in the 1-6 (apart from silva of course), and a great season otherwise.
kolarov: I really like him. heavy shot, shows great heart and spirit and rises to the occasion when needed. bit slow, though. because we have the money we have I say he could make place for someone greater, but it's no worries if he stays.

**transfers in**: no-one's needed but if it has to be done; baines?
**transfers out**: no-one's needed but if it has to be done; kolarov

-----------------------------------------------

**holding midfield**:

**yaya**: absolute giant.

**barry**: mr. consisency. has done a great season.

**de jong**: great let-down seeing him this year with the 10/11-season in mind. if he really is troubled with his role in the rotation I say let him go. great guy who has worked wonders for us, but now we need a offensive spark in this position and if martinez comes, de jong goes further down the pecking order.

**pizarro**: did some good games. don't think we'll keep him though. a shame we didn't get de rossi (and since he signed a new contract I don't think we will either, that guy was born to play in roma).

**hargreaves**: poor guy, best wishes.

**transfers out**: de jong (if that's what he wishes), pizarro, hargreaves.

**transfers in**: javi martinez or cabaye.

-----------------------------------------------

**offensive midfield**:

**silva**: at his top he's the greatest player in the premiership.

**nasri**: stepped up his game when silva lost his form.

**milner**: another player with heart, I wish he got more time on the field. hard-worker with finesse. my personal favorite.

**a johnson**: our only ""winger"". I think the main think we lack at the moment is offensive speed down the flanks. sure we have micah, zab and clichy to do that but someone with a starting-point higher in the pitch to do deadly turn-overs in real madrid- or bayern munich-style would really step up our game. johnson is the guy to slow down and challenge his defender before stepping into the field himself and fire of a cracker towards goal. we need someone to rush straight down the flanks and get the ball to someone in front of goal. for this reason I say: go buy iker muniain or eden hazard (or sturridge for that part, not really that kind of player but he has the speed and power we need).

**transfers out**: maybe adam johnson

**transfers in**: eden hazard or iker muniain

-----------------------------------------------

**strikers**:

**agüero**: plays like he has always been there. our number one at the top.

**balotelli**: we can't handle the guy. not sure if anyone can. will always remain the wildcard. however: I say we keep him.

**tevez**: OK, OK. he's great. but a asshole. I may forgive him but i'll never trust him. let milan have him.

**dzeko**: as a swedish reporter once put it: ""i can't figure out if he is a bad player with good moments or a good player with bad moments"". I think he's proven to belong to the earlier. if juventus really is interested: let him go.

**guidetti**: been great in feyenoord but he's still too young. let him grow further in a smaller club in germany or england (he should leave netherlands asap, that league won't offer any growth beyond this point).

**next season**: if tevez and dzeko goes we should get a new target player (since we already have a tevez in aguero), no idea who would fit the role but i'm sure there's someone out there.

**transfers out**: tevez and dzeko

Oh I would imagine that they do - I think that any parent who is honestly worried about porn being viewed by their kids *and* not a hand wringing moron who refuses to accept that they have responsibility, will be doing something like that.

The main motivation of people who want an opt-in system is to align everyone else with their sense of morality. They're of the opinion that people don't know what's good for them, are going astray and don't understand that it's 'bad, mkay?'.

&gt;  so why is the onus on us to have to put up with this and call our ISPs?

Because then people will have to think about it and take steps to making a conscious decision to get porn. And people will feel guilt or shame in calling their ISP to say ""Can you make ladyboys come on my computer?"" and, as a general consequence, fewer people will have porn available to them.

A lot of filters that you see in operation consider anything about sex to be porn, whether that's a Wikipedia article on the concept of same-sex marriage, an HIV/AIDS prevention site or a gay rights website like Stonewall.

Teenagers not being able to get access to legitimate non-pornographic material is a real problem: it means they can't find safe sex information or find supportive material if they are gay/queer etc.

And it's important: kids will always be able to get porn, whether that's nicking their dad's Playboy or editing their hosts file or trading USB sticks with their friends - never underestimate the creativity of horny 15-year-old boys seeking porn.

But these days, for better or worse, the first place teenagers will turn for information about sex and sexuality is the web. And when the websites that should be helping them get censored (and they always do), that's basically telling them ""society cares more about your parents image of you as an innocent child than it cares about you being able to get frank, fair and empowering information about who you are"".

&gt;Maybe it isn't such a huge threat after all?

There's no maybe about it. You are twice as likely to die by being crushed by a vending machine than you are by being killed by terrorists. 

You know what actually **lets list some...**

You're over 200,000 times more likely to die in an automobile accident.

You're far more likely to be shot by law enforcement officers (in America).

You're more likely to be legally executed.

You're more likely to deprive your own miserable self of life.

You're about *as* likely to be killed by lightning. (Strangely enough I do actually know someone who has actually been hit and survived!)

Smoking, alcohol, drugs (including perscribed ones), Flu, heat-exhaustion, accidental drowning, falling over, generic everyday socio/psychopathic murderers, accidental poisoning, work, electrocution, walking down the street, accidental firing of a gun and a massive list of other things are all *more* likely to kill us than anything terrorist related.

Yet, our level of fear when it comes to terrorism outweighs pretty much any of them it seems. Not only is it not such a huge threat, but our fear of it is massively disproportionate to the threat it actually presents. And importantly, the amount of money we spend on it actually massively outweighs the amount we put into other things that *will* probably kill us. Not sure of the statistics for the UK, but in America they spend more money on terrorism than they do on cancer, which will **kill one in three people!!**

That's the level of ridiculousness.

Okay so perhaps it's maybe a little unfair of me to simply provide one side of the argument. So the commonly provoked retort to this level of spending is along the lines of *""If we didn't spend this much money on terrorism, it'd be a much bigger problem. Many more people would die as a result of it.""*

So frankly speaking, when we think about terrorism in this sense, our main thought, and our primary associated threat is extremist Islam. At least that's the narrative shoved down our throats by the media (and given entirely too much attention by the way) since 9/11. Terrorism was still around before then, but it's since 9/11 that it's become the huge issue it is today.

Okay so to slightly paraphrase from [this](http://www.dangardner.ca/index.php/articles/item/90-remember-that-eurabian-civil-war) article:

------

Well that's interesting because **the European Union's *own* Terrorism Situation and Trend Report from 2010** (linked [here](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/TE-SAT%202010.pdf), check the link - it's authentic) states that in 2009 there were ""294 failed, foiled, or successfully executed attacks"" in six European countries. This was down almost one-third from the total in 2008 and down by almost one-half from the total in 2007.

So in most of Europe, there was no terrorism. And where there was terrorism, the trend line pointed down.

As for who's responsible, forget Islamists. The overwhelming majority of the attacks- 237 of 294 - were carried out by separatist groups, such as the Basque ETA. A further 40 terrorists schemes were pinned on leftist and/or anarchist terrorists. Rightists were responsible for four attacks. Single-issue groups were behind two attacks, while responsibility for a further 10 was not clear.

Islamists? They were behind a grand total of one attack. Yes, one. Out of 294 attacks. In a population of half a billion people. To put that in perspective, the same number of attacks was committed by the Comité d'Action Viticole, a French group that wants to stop the importation of foreign wine.

------

THAT, is how outrageous this whole situation is. And... where is all the media coverage of these other attacks? Perhaps they simply don't fit the narrative of the 'Islamic Threat' which is supposedly worth spending literally trillions on.

Talk to them first to see if they'll accept you, but if you need to take another year to improve your qualifications it's usually not a problem.

And you may be in real luck -- see this [link](http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/international/entry/accept.htm) which I found while Googling for an ""Access Course"" for you.

I will leave the rest of the comment that I had been preparing, as it may still be useful:

Grades matter less if you are not applying straight from school, but if your schooling was elsewhere then the admissions officer may be a bit more doubtful. You can just email them or ring them.

Probably your best option is to get some recent successful studying  done in the UK. There are various courses available specifically  to help people get themselves sufficiently upgraded and ready for University. They are called ""Access courses"" and may be run at a College of Further Education or at a university. Some of these are a bit low-level and general. Getting some other qualification may be more appropriate. Some places run an evening course for  the Institute of Mathematics Polymaths Certificate, but I can't see one at Lancaster. Look around, and see if you can get some info out of the admissions officer for the university department.

I did have a sentence or two in my previous post about ""If you have been suffering from depression...."" and took them out again. If your ""no motivation"" phase was really bad, I think you need to be a bit more careful about setting yourself up so that life is not too stressful. Of course you can succeed, and if you have managed to self-study consistently this year there should be no real problem. But try to put together a solid platform of academic knowledge and properly-sorted living conditions before you start. And if life delivers another big blow, signal that you need help early, and maybe arrange formal time out rather than struggling to a less satisfactory grade.",0,1336326510,null,0,false,0,c4kryit,t3_t90bz,t1_c4kryit,t1_c4kpd3v,null,1428868576,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,amacg,null,null,"&gt; Yeah - but the risks are lower than people assume.
I mean Gates, Branson etc. could all afford the risks of their endeavours because they had wealthy families to support them if it went wrong - they would never end up ruined and unemployed or in some dead end job, most people can't expect that level of support and thus the risks are too high.
These aren't Randian Übermenschen using their vast intellect to create wealth that us mere mortals live off - they are people fortunate enough to be born into a situation where they can found businesses and reap the benefits. And yes of course many of them are very intelligent and work very hard, I'm not denying that, but such a path is only viable for them due to good fortune.

Fair comment. I guess though where do you stop if we're talking about the 'ovarian lottery' to quote Buffet? I mean, there folks in really poor parts of the world that are born into poverty and can't even think about starting a business or even getting a job.

Craime Fraiche with your own chives, garlic, etc.  Boil the garlic cloves in their skins rather than crushing, frying, and then adding, to give a more delicate and complimentary flavour which won't overpower the chives.  Once boiled for a few minutes you just cut one end off, squeeze it out and then *smush* with a spoon or fork. Whip in with maybe a few finely sliced chili peppers if you like a little zing.

It's a little more clumpy but get a fresh pan really hot, roughly chop some leeks and sear with no or very little oil.  When the pan is smoldering hot and things are starting to turn a little brown throw in some soy sauce and the sugars in it will caramelise.  Toss like a fury because things are going to get sticky (oo-err missus) and then take off the heat.  That there is an alternative to your chives and if you time it you can make it so it starts melting into your lovely craime-fraiche.

true,nolono,null,null,"You have to be a bit careful here. One of the curses of teaching programming is having to handle the people who have learned bad habits, Students who know that they don't know are much easier to teach!

Really, the courses are set up to teach people to do things properly and it is not necessary to put a load of effort into learning something you will be taught anyway. People who are really into programming are welcomed because they are really into programming, not for their specific knowledge. There is no need to go off and learn something in difficult conditions just so that you don't have to learn it in the purpose-built conditions at uni. Admissions tutors know that they can't expect programming from all students and have a list of other things they look for.

I don't agree with your point about drop-outs. Programming is hard, but it can be taught to pretty well everyone. People leave because they find that this new-to-them field is not what they want, not because they really can't manage it. Certainly people should think about what they really want before applying for a course. But most university courses suffer from the fact that they are very different from ordinary school, and students really have no idea what they are getting themselves into. That is why transferring between courses is normally made fairly easy in the first few months.

Go [here](http://www.nhs24.com/FindLocal), select ""GP Surgeries"" from the drop-down list and enter your postcode. That will show you a list of GP practices near you. In case you're not sure of how it works, GPs (General Practitioners) are the first point of contact for non-emergency medical services in the UK. You need to choose the closest GP practice (called a ""surgery"") to where you live and go down there. Go inside and tell the person behind the reception desk that you would like to register. He/She will give you a form to fill out, which you can do right there. Once you give them the form back, tell them you would like to make an appointment. 

If your stomach pain becomes worse, you might want to try the [nhs 24 website](http://www.nhs24.com/) and use the ""Self Help Guide"" to get more advice. Also, you can phone the NHS 24 helpline for medical advice: 08454 24 24 24

If your stomach pain becomes severe, get in a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the nearest hospital with an emergency department (called ""A and E"", for ""Accident and Emergency""). Alternatively, do not hesitate to call 999 if your pain is severe.

They get involved in any case (on request) which fall falls within their remit.  Deliberately breaking a condom to have unprotected sex without permission counts as rape and could certainly involve Interpol.

But note that Interpol also issue Red Notices for [drink driving](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16324216) cases.  They are not just for serious crime; they are for crime.  Period.

Also note: they send notices between police forces.  That is *all* they do.  They do not arrest people, run investigations, or do anything that could be called ""police work"".

Thanks for the link.  Sadly, I found it a bit typical of some of the FUD that has been around.

&gt; How do I know that Interpol, Britain and Sweden's treatment of Julian Assange is a form of theater? 

Glaring ignorance about Interpol in the first sentence isn't a great start.

Interpol performed their role correctly.  In fact, due process has been followed at all times during this process as far as I can tell (and I have been paying close attention).  Even the expert legal witnesses for Mr Assange stated this in court.

&gt; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is in solitary confinement in Wandsworth prison in advance of questioning 

Misleading: since the EAW, Mr Assange has been wanted for arrest and trial.  Charges cannot be brought before final questioning in Sweden; that will be the next step, then charging, then trial.


Craig Charles (a British actor) was [remanded in custody for several months](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Charles#Rape_allegation) ahead of his trial for rape.  He was found innocent in the end, but I don't think anyone called that trial ""theater"".  He was less of a flight risk.  If anything, the treatment of Mr Assange is lenient.

The author then compares the policing situation in the UK, the US, Morocco, and the Bosnian war zone(!) among others.  Hardly a relevant - or fair - comparison.

We're a small, densely populated island with a lot of architectural history and, at some point, we may have to start letting go a little.  

I live directly overlooking Britain's oldest rollercoaster, a Grade II* listed cinema of international importance and Grade II listed menagerie cages, the oldest zoo cages in the UK. We have a £3m Heritage Lottery Fund grant to turn it all into a Heritage Theme Park and are fighting the Tesco - who would rather it became UKs first seafront Tesco (24 hour - to add insult to injury).  I think we have a good chance because we hope to restore it to the purpose for which it was made.

But if we are to keep all these historically important and unique buildings, such as Battersea, we need to start making them sing for their supper.  And I don't think a football stadium is going to improve Battersea either.  But I do think that all those responsible for turning the CFC offer down could at least start looking into ways of using this iconic London monument in more suitable ways. 

Otherwise we'll end up admiring these wonderful buildings when we pass by from time to time and one day they'll be beyond repair and no longer fit for anything.

As for AVB, I think the main reason he failed at Chelsea was that his style of play was basically incompatible with their core players. Drogba, Lampard, Terry, etc are not a passing, pressing team.

The opinion of the writer.  It was her views and it made interesting reading and she made interesting points which I tend to agree with.  There are more serious things the Interpol police could get involved in then when a condom breaks - like **actual rape** cases.  

A  broken condom during sex, (not deliberately breaking a condom as you stated) is not rape and it makes a mockery of actual rape victims.




Bottom line:

1.Statistically  how often Interpol gets involved in broken condom cases?  
2. If that is how Sweden  typically handles charges when a condemn breaks????

3.Would you want a broken condom during sex to be a considered as  a valid  reason to bring a rape charge against a man    - and this legal precedence would have to apply to all men.


When a feminist writer argues is  favour of the male then most of the population would similarly call this charge bullshit - unless they were prejudiced and wanted assange in  jail for other reasons.

It appears to be routine to get Interpol involved in Sweden, just as anywhere.  It's standard practise if your suspect is abroad.

[Here](http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons) is the site: you can search for yourself.  There are 25 outstanding notices for Sweden.  I checked the first page:

Theft: 3
Kidnapping: 2
Drug-related crimes: 4

Nothing for sexual crimes at the moment; but that just means that no suspects are currently in foreign countries.  

It really, really, is a normal thing to do. If a suspect is abroad, you ask Interpol for a Red Notice.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is, quite simply, either very ignorant or lying to you.

&gt; That he ""deliberately molested"" Miss A ""in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity"".

Dear MP,

I believe you severely underestimate kids. Like, *really*. You do not understand how resourceful kids are with the internet. They know how to hack and code their way into anything. Blocking pornography is going to accomplish... precisely nothing. At all. 

Porn exists. Furthermore, it's just sex. Children learn about sex this way, and through school sex education classes - but also online. They may not really *understand* any of it at first, but it's there and as they grow older everything'll slip into context for them. They're kids - young people - not aliens. There's a very interesting fact about children that adults tend to forget. They're curious. VERY curious. This curiosity is so strong that no matter what blockades you may place online, they'll find a way around those blockades.

Why? Because they're kids. They're curious. That's an unstoppable fact. The only way you're going to stop them is by making sure they can't go online at *all*, and that won't happen unless you're policing every single household in the country, a method way beyond your means (thankfully).

Kids also need more credit. Heck, when I was a 13 year old I was exposed to all sorts of porn online. I had pedophiles trying to find out my address around the clock, but the twist here is I had a BRAIN! I knew what porn was, I chose to ignore it and I didn't give a stranger my address online. I know, right? It's NUTS. Kids knowing common sense? Get outta here.

Instead of trying to mollycoddle the precious children, the parents need to be charged with teaching them what not to do online. The internet is a part of our society and it's here to stay. Will your kids look at porn online? Oh, absolutely. Will it corrupt them and turn them into evil demonspawn? No, not likely. Your kids are smarter than you think. They're capable of separating ficticious acting from reality, even at their age.

Wanna keep children safe? Don't let them out late at night, don't let them give their address to strangers online and *teach them values*, as a parent is supposed to. The internet has no part in this, at all.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Last of the Time Lords really only stumbles in that it exacerbates all of the mistakes ""The Sound of Drums"" made. From aging the Doctor to a comically bad CG dwarf to underutilizing Jack's character *even more* to only giving cursory investigation int the Master and the Doctor's relationship or explanation of the drumming/the Master's motivation for conquering Earth the way he does this episode really doesn't do well.

And Tinkerbell-Fairy-Jesus-Doctor really didn't help matters.

As for Let's Kill Hitler, that's an *enormous* dissertation to get done. To explain in a cursory method we have ""been here the entire time, just trust us this has always been the plan"" Mel coming in *immediately* after we realize that River is Melody (and the fact that her name is ""Mel"" makes this infinitely more transparent) and yet the episode attempts to play her identity off as some large real, which only insults my intelligence and wastes precious screentime trying to create a pointless ""surprise"" that need not be made.

Mels barrels a car so close that it nearly hits the Doctor (which is the first chance to kill him she passes up for no reason) and then, having a loaded weapon aimed at her (very unarmed) target point-blank and not taking the shot (again, another meaningless passing up of her purpose).

And can we just focus on how absolutely, fundamentally, stupid it is that the Silence, a group whose greatest strength is the ability to control people flawlessly without their knowledge with perfect hypnosis would not only let River be consciously aware that she was supposed to kill the Doctor, but also unwilling to do such *immediately* when she had the opportunity?

This, like so much in the episode, is done purely to support the plot in a *hugely* superficial manner. Mel passes up moments to kill the Doctor simply so that her reveal as River Song can happen. Mel orders them to go kill Hitler for literally no reason other than making the title make sense (I mean really, the title's ""Let's Kill Hitler"" and Hitler is forgotten about in the first act, it's such an enormous gimmick to bring him in).

The Tesselecta was an absolutely absurd concept that was already burnt-out by the absurd Eddie Murphy flop ""Meet Dave"". The Time Agents in there act with an absurd level of unintentionally written idiocy, including not realizing they had arrived too early to kill Hitler to their odd choice of torturing River Song *before* she had actually killed the Doctor.

The baddies in the episode were both pointless in their inclusion (why would such a needlessly dangerous security system even *be* in the Tesselecta?) and ridiculous in their execution, being one of the first baddies in a long time to be *obvious* as cheap puppets.

The story is littered with flashbacks to scenes we saw a mere *minute* ago. Flashbacks are the mark of a lazy writer and should *only* be used if the flashback tells a story that is not just informative, but actually meaningful and entertaining and even then should be used sparingly. The mini-flashbacks are only made all the more painful by the fact that the episode is *already using longer flashbacks to show Mel's childhood*.

The whole point of the episode was only to undo River being a Time Lord and on analysis really does absolutely nothing for the story *at all*. No major character realizations are made (except for River, which was done in the most hurried and inelegant way possible) and none of the plot is progressed. Ultimately, this episode did nothing but provide needless exposition the entire episode.

But I don't view it as ""an amazing achievement"". We got there 2 years ago, and with the aging squads that Pool and Chelsea have, we had just as good a shot, if not better, than they did. The bar needs to be set higher than the Europa League.

Also, I'm not
&gt; just another fan that's been around for 8 months that doesn't understand what an amazing increase in stature that tottenham has undergone since harry was the gaffer

Because I've been around long enough to know that the fact that you think THFC's stature has had an ""amazing increase"" under Harry is utter bullshit. He replaced Juande Ramos, whose tenure didn't end well, (as do most managerial posts) but he did manage to win a cup, something that Harry hasn't done. Before that, Jol took us from a side that was usually top 10 to the brink of the Champions League. We'd likely have qualified under Jol if an Arsenal fan hadn't dosed our lasagna. 

I'm not saying that Harry isn't a good manager. He is. But what he does best (right the ship, give the players some confidence) isn't what we need anymore. It was exactly what we needed when he was appointed. 

But it isn't anymore. He seems to expect talented squad players like Krancjar and Sandro to sit quietly without complaint for months, then be able to come into the side and instantly make an impact. He picks a XI from his bag of choices, then if we win, rides it until we lose. Anytime we play another team that has a manager with any degree of tactical nous, Harry looks, at best, befuddled. If he reacts at all to in game changes or adjustments by opponents, he does so at a glacial pace. And when he does try show his tactical acumen, he ends up doing something stupid (like today's Parker for VdV sub) or just generally outsmarting himself (like having Lennon and Bale switch flanks).

He doesn't rotate the squad at all, and when questioned, he says [things like this.](http://www.sportsvibe.co.uk/diary/football/don-t-get-harry-redknapp-on-rotation-policies-and-tired-footballers-16272/) If you can't figure out why Harry comparing Sir Bobby Moore not needing a rest to today's game is an awful analogy, then you should just turn in your kit now.

[This](http://moxycoxy.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/dont-bring-harry-redknapp/) was posted earlier on r/coys, but I want to repost it in the context of Harry as our manager. I certainly think this article rings true for his behavior at Spurs.

I want Harry out because I sincerely believe he's taken us as far as he can. He is a good manager, but a somewhat limited one. We will never win the Prem, or god forbid challenge for a CL title, under Harry. And we have the talent, and should have the ambition, to do both.

HOW WE QUALIFY FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

SCENARIO 1: WIN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE (preferred)

SCENARIO 2: PLACE AT LEAST 4th IN PREMIER LEAGUE

The Situation: Chelsea currently sit at 61 points with two games remaining. Arsenal (67 points), Tottenham (66 points) and Newcastle (65 points) all have 1 game remaining. We must end the season higher or equal to 2 of these 3 teams.

* Step 1: Win our two remaining games (@Liverpool, vs. Blackburn). If we don't take 6 points from these games, its is impossible to finish above 5th.

* Step 2: TWO of the three teams above us must lose or draw their last match. The fixtures are Arsenal @ WBA, Tottenham vs. Fulham, Newcastle @ Everton. Our maximum possible points is 67, so if more than one team is above 67 points, game over.
&gt; Corollary: Arsenal cannot draw. They must lose, as they are at 67 points currently. A draw guarantees them having more points than us.

* Step 3: Assuming all the above happens, we must have a better or equal goal differential to any teams we are level on points with. Chelsea's current goal differential is +21. Winning our final two matches guarantees us at least a goal differential of +23.
&gt; We cannot be level with Newcastle, because at 65 points a win (68) draw (66) or loss (65) put them in position where they are not at 67 points. Lose or draw and Newcastle is out of the picture.
&gt;&gt; We can pass or equal Tottenham on points. With a draw (67) Chelsea will be level on points with Tottenham. A Spurs draw puts them at +23, level on GD with Chelsea.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We can only equal Arsenal, and only with an Arsenal loss. The maximum GD (assuming a loss) Arsenal could have is +23. Level with Chelsea's minimum possible GD and Spurs draw GD.

* Step 4: ASSUMING all the above, that Chelsea is equal on points and GD with Spurs and/or Arsenal, we must have a higher goals scored. Chelsea has currently scored 62 goals, Spurs 64, Arsenal 71.
&gt; AT MINIMUM, Chelsea will be at 64 goals scored (because we're assuming 2 wins in our last two game and the least goals you can score an still win is 1. x2 matches=2. 62+2=64), Tottenham's minimum possible is 64 (assuming a 0-0 draw in their final match), Arsenal's minimum possible is 71 (assuming a 1-0 loss in their final match).
&gt;&gt; SO, to pass Tottenham, Chelsea must score 1 more goal than our minimum possible, or a total of 3 goals more than Tottenham during the next week. To pass Arsenal, Chelsea must score 8 more goals than our minimum, or a total of 10 goals more than Arsenal over the next week (bloody likely).

* Step 5: ASSUMING all of the above, that Chelsea is level on points, GD, and goals with Arsenal and/or Tottenham, a tiebreaking match will be played at a neutral site. And we know how good we've been this season at elimination matches :)

If the teenager can just throw away their identity and the system or sites will treat them like an adult then it's not much use, is it?

So what we must assume from this is that the plan is to have every adult register with the government, and use these credentials when they connect to a site with content unsuitable for minors.

So this means that the government no longer knows that you turned the smut filter off, but it knows that you visit cuckoldedhusbands.com or spankingsite.co.uk

Almost all web-based forums - whether they be about guitar playing or videogames, bodybuilding, football or cars - allow adult pictures, and have off-topic sections in which the members can run wild with smutty jokes.

So the government will know practically every site you visit.

I mean, from a liability standpoint, can you even risk having your blog registered as ""safe for kids""?

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"1) He was born in Harlesden in North London in December 199[4].

2) He joined Queens Park Rangers aged just 10 years old.

3) A lightning-quick striker with good all-round ability, he has already been compared to Theo Walcott, while some coaches rate him as highly as Wayne Rooney at the same age.

4) QPR's head of development Steve Gallen said of his young protege: ""He has loads of natural ability. This boy can pass, shoot, head it, score goals, tackle, defend, anything."" 

5) When he was just 14, Sterling was already a regular in QPR's under-18 side and even scored on his debut for the team.

6) He has also already played for England, having made his debut for the Under-16 side in 2009 in the Sky Sports Victory Shield against Northern Ireland at Chester City's Deva Stadium. He came on late in the first half and provided the assist for Matthias Fanimo to score England's second in a 2-0 win.

7) Before Liverpool swooped for Sterling, a host of other Premier League sides were jostling for his signature including Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Fulham. But it was the Reds who got there first, signing him for an initial £600,000 in early 2010 after the club wooed him by taking him and his agent as VIP guests at Anfield for a Liverpool vs Manchester United match.

8) He made a great start to his Anfield career by scoring on his debut for the Under 18s against city rivals Everton in a thrilling game. Liverpool's youngsters came from two down to eventually beat the Blues 4-3.

9) His academy boss was quick to praise the youngster. ""I was pleased with Raheem's contribution and that he scored on his debut,' said Rodolfo Borrell, the former Barcelona coach. ""He is quick and skilful but still only young. He can improve tactically and has a long way to go, but he is a great signing for this football club.""

10) Sterling has earned his place in the first team squad for the Europa League tie against Sparta Prague, after impressing Reds boss Kenny Dalglish in a 9-0 win over Southend in the FA Youth Cup on Monday, during  which he grabbed five goals.

Look up the crown estate. Many, many years ago, The King agreed to give up his land to the government in exchange for a regular income. Now the Crown's estate actually makes more money than the money the UK tax payer gives to the royal family. We actually get a rebate in affect.


The Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom with a portfolio worth £7.0 billion, with urban properties valued at £5.179 billion, and rural holdings valued at £1.049 billion; and an annual profit of £230.9 million.

That's £230 million that goes to the tax man. That's a lot less than we pay the royal family! If we no longer have a royal family, that estate defaults back to the Windsors.

Yes. If taxes have to go up, it's entirely fair to raise them on the people who will feel the impact the least.

Studies have shown, that because of the way cannabis works, driving ability often goes up for light to moderate intoxication. Its like drunk driving, where one might overcompensate in speed, except with cannabis it is a lot easier to do.

I do no think it is safe to drive under the influence, however there wil not be a distinction made as with alchohol as to a blood thc concentration that is safe to drive with. There is also the issue of tolerance, with regular users having genuinely diminished effects even with a high blood thc. 

Reading that article, I get the feeling that we were not being told all the facts. The vast majority of RTA's that involve drivers under the influence of cannabis, are also under the influence of alchohol. I dont want this story to be used as total and undeniable proof that it is not safe to drive if even a little bit intoxicated, that simply isnt the case. I agree there is a line, but this needs to be established first.

Finally, THC is only in the system for a short time (shorter than alchohol) but can be tested at the roadside.

&gt;Thank you very much for this and you make some very good points which I have also been trying to make for some time in my position as Chairman of the UK Council of Child Internet Safety. UKCCIS consists of over 180 members including the main ISPs ,mobile operators, Facebook, Google, CEOP, computer retailers etc etc. Because the internet is such an all encompassing ‘Leviathan’ there is no single silver bullet and our approach has been to try and cover as many bases as possible so that wherever you turn young people and their parents cannot avoid warning messages and choices about access to potentially harmful content.

&gt;I am greatly frustrated that the whole issue has been rather hijacked by the Daily Mail who have made into  a rather sterile debate about opt in/opt out on the back of Claire Perry’s otherwise very worthy report which focussed too much on just pornography. As well as access to violent images which is an even greater concern for parents than pornography it does absolutely nothing about what I believe is the more menacing threat of the misuse of social media leading to cyber bullying, harassment and ultimately sexual grooming in some cases. This was the clear message from the young people at Childnet who advise the UKCCIS board. You may also have seen my recent response in the Westminster Hall debate on ‘Sexting ‘which is also available on my website.

&gt;Thank you again for your comments and please do follow the progress of UKCCIS which I hope will be getting rather more coverage in future given that we encompass all the major players who are in a position to bring about practical solutions working with the Government and already are.

&gt;Thank you very much for this and you make some very good points which I have also been trying to make for some time in my position as Chairman of the UK Council of Child Internet Safety. UKCCIS consists of over 180 members including the main ISPs ,mobile operators, Facebook, Google, CEOP, computer retailers etc etc. Because the internet is such an all encompassing ‘Leviathan’ there is no single silver bullet and our approach has been to try and cover as many bases as possible so that wherever you turn young people and their parents cannot avoid warning messages and choices about access to potentially harmful content.

&gt;I am greatly frustrated that the whole issue has been rather hijacked by the Daily Mail who have made into  a rather sterile debate about opt in/opt out on the back of Claire Perry’s otherwise very worthy report which focussed too much on just pornography. As well as access to violent images which is an even greater concern for parents than pornography it does absolutely nothing about what I believe is the more menacing threat of the misuse of social media leading to cyber bullying, harassment and ultimately sexual grooming in some cases. This was the clear message from the young people at Childnet who advise the UKCCIS board. You may also have seen my recent response in the Westminster Hall debate on ‘Sexting ‘which is also available on my website.

&gt;Thank you again for your comments and please do follow the progress of UKCCIS which I hope will be getting rather more coverage in future given that we encompass all the major players who are in a position to bring about practical solutions working with the Government and already are.
 
&gt;Regards

I totally understoody all of this already, because I've already had run-ins with them, and I did research and stood up for myself. The problem is that most people don't. Most people think that the TVLA have power. Most people think that you should let them into your home. Most people think you need a license if you own and use a TV.

And that's not accidental. The TLV arseholes have crafted this message carefully through their threatening adverts, threatening letters and threats of vans and checks and surveillance. They have mis-stated the law so often so that most people now think you need a license just to own and use a TV.

The fact is that you don't need a license unless you watch live TV. If you buy a TV and the store asks for your address, just lie. If you get a threatening letter, write back and tell them to bugger off. And if they ask to come and check, tell them to go away. They have no legal right to enter without a warrant, and they won't get one. Even if they SEE a tv through your living room window, that isn't any proof that it is being used to watch LIVE tv.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"They've looked at both ""sobriety"" testing and presence/absence testing, but I'll bet you money they're considering the latter here, despite its at best tenuous relationship to intoxication/impairment (particularly as regards drugs with long half lives or that are lipophilic like cannabis).  That's because they're really interested in a deterrent.  For the same reason, they don't want people to know that most of the testing kits currently available aren't particularly sensitive.  So, for example, the executive summary from the EU's Roadside Testing Assessment project:

The Rosita-2 project was carried out in 2003-2005 in order to evaluate the usability and analytical reliability of the onsite oral fluid (saliva) drug testing devices.

The study was carried out by National Institute for Criminalistics and Criminology in Brussels, Belgium, the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki, Finland, the Institute for Legal Medicine in Strasbourg, France, the Institute for Legal Medicine in Homburg/Saar, Germany, the Division of Forensic Toxicology and Drug Abuse, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway and Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. It was coordinated by Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

The study was performed in cooperation with the Unites States, where it is funded by The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human Services, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), US Department of Transportation and the Office of National Drug Control Policy Executive Office of the President. The US part is coordinated by The Walsh Group (Bethesda, Maryland). The study is carried out in the following states: Florida (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Manatee County Sheriff's Office), Washington (Washington State Police, Washington State Toxicology Lab), Utah (Salt Lake City Police Department, Center for Human Toxicology) and Wisconsin (12 Police Jurisdictions, Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene).

In the US, the study continues until the end of 2006. The complete results for the European part and the partial results of the US parts are presented here.

2046 Subjects were included in the study and 2605 device evaluations were performed.
Nine devices were evaluated: American Biomedica Oralstat, Branan Medical Oratect, Cozart Bioscience RapiScan (only in the USA), Dräger/Orasure DrugTest/Uplink, Lifepoint Impact, Securetec Drugwipe, Sun Biomedical Oraline, Ultimed Salivascreen and Varian OraLab.

The devices had tests for the following drugs: amphetamines, methamphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opiates. Three devices also had a test for benzodiazepines.

During the study, two devices were withdrawn form the market: Dräger/Orasure DrugTest/Uplink and Lifepoint Impact.

Subjects for whom a suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs existed were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis. In most cases the following samples were taken: a blood sample and an oral fluid sample with the Intercept™ sampler for analysis in the lab with reference techniques (gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, sometimes after screening with an immunoassay), and one (or two) oral fluid sample for analysis with the onsite device.

For some devices, a very high percentage of failures was observed. Depending on the type of device, this was apparently due to too little or too viscous saliva (the fluid didn't migrate until the control line, or it caused smears), or to a malfunctioning of the instrument that read the results. For six devices (Varian Oralab, Lifepoint Impact, Branan Oratect 2nd generation, Sun Oraline, Ultimed Salivascreen and Branan Oratect 1st generation), more than 25% of the devices failed to run. For the other devices, the number of failures was less than 10 % (American Biomedica Oralstat and Dräger DrugTest/Orasure Uplink) or less than 5% (Cozart Rapiscan and Securetec Drugwipe). The evaluators considered that a failure rate of maximum 5-10% was acceptable.

The number of evaluations per device varied widely, with two devices evaluated more than 500 times, one 190 times and 6 less than 50 times. The explanation lies in the large number of failures for Branan Medical Oratect, Ultimed Salivascreen and Varian OraLab, which led to their exclusion from the study and the late start of the evaluation of the American Biomedica Oralstat, Lifepoint Impact and Sun Biomedical Oraline.

The percentages of positive samples were: amphetamines (including methamphetamine, ecstasy and analogues) 20 %, benzodiazepines 32 %, cannabinoids 36%, cocaine 19% and opiates 8%.
The analytical evaluation of the amphetamine and methamphetamine tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity (percentage of the true positive samples that tested positive with the onsite assay) varying between 40% and 83% and a specificity (percentage of the negative samples that tested negative with the onsite assay) between 80% and 100%.

The analytical evaluation of the benzodiazepine tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 33% and 69% and a specificity between 85% and 94%.

The analytical evaluation of the cannabis tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 0% and 74% and a specificity between 70% and 100%. Detailed analysis of the data for cannabis showed that some devices (e.g. Drugwipe) gave a negative result even when very high concentrations of THC were found with the Intercept. The reason is unknown, but one hypothesis is that with an improved (more thorough) sampling technique more THC could be captured, resulting in more positive results.

The analytical evaluation of the cocaine tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 0% and 97% and a specificity between 91% and 100%.

The analytical evaluation of the opiate tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 51% and 100% and a specificity between 86% and 100%.

No device met the criteria proposed during the Rosita-1 project (sensitivity and specificity &gt; 90%, accuracy &gt; 95%) for the amphetamines, benzodiazepines and cannabis. The Varian Oralab met these criteria for cocaine and opiates, but it gave 26% failures, so it cannot be recommended.

The operational evaluation of the Drugwipe showed that the sampling technique was well accepted by the police and the subjects, but the results, particularly for cannabis, were difficult to read. There were also problems when using it in cold weather.

The operational evaluation of the Dräger DrugTest/Orasure Uplink showed that sample collection was easy and hygienic, but that the procedure was long and complicated. The test must be read by an instrument, so it cannot be used in remote areas or when no instrument is available.

The operational evaluation of the American Biomedica Oralstat showed that the collection stick lost one of its collection sponges in some cases. This test could also be read with or without the reading unit, but the scanning of the test strip by the electronic reader was sometimes difficult.

The operational evaluation of the Branan Medical Oratect showed that the test was liked by the police officers, because it is very small and portable and no additional equipment is needed, but the sample collection was too complicated, it could be outsmarted by the tested persons and it took too much time. The number of failures was too high.
The operating procedure of the RapiScan was fairly direct, but was found to intimidate officers if they were not able to use it soon after training. Many officers were uncomfortable using the instrument, stating that it was difficult to remember the procedure.

The operational evaluation of the Lifepoint Impact showed that in many cases the collected sample volume was not sufficient because the instrument stopped the sampling automatically after a preset time.

The test procedure of the Sun Biomedical Oraline was simple with few steps but a rather large sample volume was needed and it took too much time. There were problems to use it in cold and rainy weather. The lines indicating positive or negative results were too pale.

The operational evaluation of the Ultimed Salivascreen showed that the device gave more invalid than valid tests. Officers reported smearing of the result bands or not enough saliva collected by the device to give a reading.

The operational evaluation of the Varian OraLab showed that subjects were often unable to provide sufficient oral fluid during specimen collection, resulting in many invalid tests. Officers also experienced difficulty observing the presence or absence of the test lines making interpretation of results inconsistent.

At the end of the study, no device was considered to be reliable enough in order to be recommended for roadside screening of drivers. However, the experience in the state of Victoria in Australia shows that random roadside oral fluid testing of drivers for methamphetamine and cannabis (using the Securetec Drugwipe followed by the Cozart Rapiscan and chromatographic analysis in the lab) has a deterrent effect. Government officials should carefully weigh the pros (deterrent effect) and the cons (risk that drivers will realise that they often test negative after having used drugs due to the limited sensitivity of the test) of introducing random drug testing with the currently available devices.

2) we did get cover for the back four; Scott Parker. And he's done a great job. No, he isn't a center half, but he has helped prop up the defense. You can't look at the records and say that his signing hasn't helped.

Moreover, my point was that after last season when we narrowly missed the CL, we were generally optimistic about Next (this) season, and saying we needed a striker and some defensive help. We got it; Adebayor and Parker have been immense for us, you can't claim we haven't gotten miles better as a squad. And bringing in VdV  made us miles better as a squad. So if our squad keeps getting better, why aren't the results following? We have to start looking at what's stayed the same... Harry. Still bungling substitutions and basic math.

And don't say that every team has gotten better; they haven't. Man U has stood still the past few years, Chelsea is getting older and regressing, Arsenal just let Nasri and Cesc go and brought in little to replace them, Liverpool seems to have fallen off a cliff... On Man City has gotten better each year the past 3 years. So, I ask again; why are we still struggling in the same place? If it's not the squad, what is holding us back?

If you're a rich person, you have benefited hugely from taxpayer funding. Tax money has provided you with an educated workforce, a road network to move your goods on, a police force to keep you safe, and a university education so you can put letters after your name on your business card.

And because you have benefited to such an extent, and because all those things combined with your own hard work have placed you in a hugely fortunate position, you can contribute more back than a poor person.  

A moments thought should tell you that increasing taxation on people who are a drain on the system (and I'm going to go out a limb here and assume that you mean benefit claimants, not university students) would be a self defeating operation at at best. If you're a drain on the system because you don't have enough money taking more money away from you just makes you a bigger drain.

It really all comes down to whether you believe we should all be in this together or not. If we are then it surely follows to say from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.

If it's elected also, why should the Commons be allowed to bypass it, and also would it end up like the US system (from what I've heard) where legislation can just bounce between the houses continuously.

That, and you'll run into an issue with the *feel* of the show: it changes drastically over time, and with each new doctor.
