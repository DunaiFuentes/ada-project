Season 5 and 6 have heavy references to Season 1-4 which will be completely lost on a viewer starting at Season 5.

I don't think you should suggest that someone rush through episodes and skip over seasons just so they can catch up to when Season 7 starts.  They will get to Season 7 when they get to it, no need to rush them through.

Starting at Season 5 will not benefit you in anyway. You will be missing out on a lot of important aspects of the show and history that is important to the character of the Doctor. Sure you'll be able to catch up in time for Season 7, but without knowing what happened in Season 1-4 the episodes won't be as special for you.  It will also ruin the excitement and fun of Season 1-4 as the production value has gone up since then so the old episodes will look more low budget and cheesy.

But massive amounts of human and alien life should fall by the Daleks doing, and the Doctor needs to be helpless to stop them, not just for a few moments during the episode... but for several seasons.  A win for the Doctor should be escaping with his life and preventing as many deaths as possible, but more are lost than saved.

Finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, we need to see the Doctor actually fear them again. The reason the Dalek in Season 1 were so terrifying is that the Doctor was actually scared of them! He wasn't tricking them with cookies, he was running for his life and building a weapon that would destroy human life on earth just to stop them! We need to see that kind of reaction again from the Doctor. If the Doctor isn't scared, then we as the viewers don't really have a reason to be scared either.  We trust him and if he feels like he can handle the Dalek, then we believe that.  We need the Doctor to fear the Dalek, not the other way around.",0,1342453586,null,0,false,0,c5es7w6,t3_wn4lg,t1_c5es7w6,t3_wn4lg,null,1429389657,53,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,53

Season 5 is a new Doctor, new companions, and new writing team, but they don't catch you up on a lot of things. They don't re-introduce you to the world. They write it very much like you already have existing knowledge on who the Doctor is.

true,godsdebris,tennant,Tennant,"When we first meet the Daleks they aren't that great of a species. They can't leave their metal city because they are powered by static electricity and they don't seem very fearsome. I honestly viewed them to be the weaklings in that episode. In fact they don't really even say their catch phrase ""Exterminate!"" as often as they do in the new series.

I haven't gotten far in Classic Who to speak on whether or not they become more terrifying, but I know when Eccleston met them for the first time I found them a little frightening. I think the whole point was that they could then fly because previously they couldn't.

A side note... in Classic Who when the 1st Doctor meets them, he and his companions are [spoiler](/s ""taken prisoner. Eventually the four of them (Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara) decide it's time to bust out and they trick a Dalek by covering it's ""eye"" and moving him onto a non-static surface. When they looked inside, Ian told the girls to go out in the hall and stand guard; after the girls left he reopened the Dalek and asked the Doctor to help him get the contents out. When they got the contents out, you could see a black, disheveled hand wiggling out of the tarp they moved him with. As far as I know they never touched back on it. The Daleks we see in the new series seem different from that of the previous. In this episode they made it out that, due to radiation, those ""humanoids"" decided to turn to machinery for protection. The other humanoids on the planet had medicine to counteract the radiation, but the Daleks didn't. When they finally got some of the radiation medicine and they tested it, it ended up killing them."")


Digression aside, the Daleks have come a long way. I think to make them scary, they would have to win. They would have to kill someone close to the Doctor and get away with it. Too much time is spent with the Daleks simply monitoring the Doctor or someone. Every time the Doctor meets them I already know what will happen: They meet, some witty banter from the Doctor ensues. The Dalek's talk about how awesome and powerful they are and how nothing can be done to stop them now. The Doctor gets his serious face on and perhaps he's driven into a corner that might seem impossible to escape from--but it's all okay because he's the Doctor. His companions are spared, for some reason, and he buys time to figure out how to get out of the situation. Stuff happens, Dalek's are thwarted... End of episode. Cue the fez.

There was a similar situation when it was rolled out on the Cambrian line in Wales. One of the local transport groups was complaining about the delays, the railway can't show extra seats or more trains from this pilot scheme so it was being questioned at one point I believe.

The Tesco in question had been fined the week before for staff not checking properly for ID and a police tester who was 15 had managed to purchase a bottle of wine. Apparently they had had a meeting about this and everyone knew that it was instant dismissal if you got caught not asking people for ID if they looked under 25.

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"Lampard and xavi both play center mid Lampard is more attacking minded than Xavi. Xavi to me is way too overrated, because he give 136 backward and sideways passes doesn't means that he's the best midfielder. Xavi is miles away from being the best. Compare Xavi style of play to any other player that play the same position and you see that he is mediocre. Xavi cant play through ball, long ball or give a perfect square pass which is suppose to be every midfielder taboo. Looking at his stats which people says make him the best midfielder an astonishing 72% of his passes went backwards, meaning he contributed little to nothing to the Barcelona offense. Makakele did exactly the same thing Xavi did, he pass most his ball going backwards, why didnt he get the same recognition as Xavi, and his completion rate was even high. 
The entire fiasco is based on the teams he played for. Barcelona and Spain tactic allows him more time on the ball than any other midfield player in his position, but still he the least creative. The only thing on Barcelona and Spain you can give Xavi credit for is that his short five yards passes which keep the ball in their possession for a considerable number of time. without the tik tak Xavi wouldn't have the recognition he have right now. If you think i am lying look at xavi under frank Rjikard when Barcelona wasn't playing tik tak, there was  no hype or anything about him. He was just another dude in Barcelona and Spain midfield. Comparing Xavi to Lampard Scholes, Pirlo, Gerrard, and all those great who been doing this in any kind of formation is idiotic. Last season Thiago of Barcelona completed 0.3% more passes than xavi, why dont we start calling him the best midfield player ever. You and half the people who made this argument about Xavi being the best midfeilde player have your entire idea based on something someone wrote you havent actually witness game and just focus soley on Xavi, you came to this conclusion because you are just following the Xavi is the best trend.

true,MtHammer,smith,Smith,"*Blink* may not be a good example of ""average"" Doctor Who, but it does serve as a great introductory episode for a couple of reasons.

First and most importantly, it's universally popular and compelling as hell.  The number of people who like Doctor Who but don't like Blink is miniscule.

Secondly, the whole thing is told from the perspective of someone who doesn't know any more about the Doctor or the premise of the show (Sally Sparrow) than the new viewer does.  As a result, she discovers who the Doctor is and what he's all about along with the viewer.

Because *Rose* is kind of mediocre and is almost immediately followed up with several episodes that range from decent to bad (the first good Eccleston episode is probably *Dalek* and the first season doesn't get great until *The Empty Child*), I like to start people out with *Blink*.  As I alluded to above, *Aliens of London/World War III* caused me to give up on Doctor Who *twice*, and I don't want others to repeat my mistakes.

true,GypsieGenie,EN,england,"Can't believe I'm wasting my time on this, but here goes.

You say Xavi plays backward passes all day, and you would be correct in saying that. Xavi's role isn't to score goals, it isn't to create goals, it's to dictate the tempo the game runs at. By playing short, passes Xavi can dictate the pace of the game, and he is the best at it. 

I'm not going to go into your hilarious comparison with Makelele, given that they play different roles. Here's an extract from Wikipedia on his role.

Some players prefer to set up an attack from a withdrawn position, and are often coined deep-lying playmakers, mainly because of their ability to spread play and dictate the game from a withdrawn position. Despite their deep role, they are not classed as defensive midfielders as tackling and defence are not the main function of their roles, and they may have to be supported by a holding midfielder.
Deep-lying playmakers are typically given a moderate amount of defensive responsibilities, but are granted freedom positionally to dictate the play as it evolves, as well as a license to attempt long riskier balls, to the forwards.
The essential attributes of a deep-lying playmaker include:
Good long passing ability, to play balls towards forwards and wingers. Crossfield wangers are typically attempted from deep when the opposing full back is drawn towards the middle and there is an open channel in the flank for the on rushing winger.
Stamina, to cover large distances in professional football. In the top football leagues, a midfielder covers upwards of 10 kilometres per game.
Short passing ability. Although many deep-lying playmakers have natural talent and creativity, they are expected to play short simple passes when deep in their half to avoid the possibility of a counter-attack. They are however given some degree of freedom in playing long passes deep into opposition territory.
Creativity/Vision. The deep-lying playmaker needs to spot openings and opportunities to build up play.
A good and sure first touch to control the ball when receiving passes under sustained opposition pressure.

Look at the qualities mentioned, Xavi is the best, or near the best at them qualities. Gerrard isn't anywhere near Xavi in terms of a regista. Look at Italy vs England, a good regista vs a mediocre regista, and Pirlo completely controlled the game. Now, look at Spain vs Italy in the final, Xavi stopped Pirlo controlling the game and Spain won 4-0. In Euro 2012, Xavi averaged 4.2 key passes per game. The next highest CM, Pirlo at 2.8. 

People don't say Xavi is the best because he completes many passes, or plays for Barcelona or Spain, the say he's the best, because he is the best. He is the best regista in the world. He's better than Scholes, Pirlo, Modric, Schweini and Moutinho. Xavi is a puppeteer, if you can't appreciate what he does, then I suggest you take a day of, and watch tapes on Xavi playing. 

Also, there's a reason Modric is going for £40 million. I mean, he only managed 4 goals, and 4 assists, surely he's not worth £40 million is he? 

There's a reason why you don't fully rely on statistics to form an opinion on a player, because there's no statistics to tell us how a player controls a game. ",0,1342462885,null,0,false,0,c5euo9x,t3_wmd4z,t1_c5euo9x,t1_c5euckt,null,1429390819,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"Without no doubt xavi is the best at giving those short passes that keep his team in possession but never in Xavi career have he been the midfeilder to dominate the game with his passes. on barcelona it Messi and Iniesta on Spain the creative spark is Iniesta. Just because Xavi hold the ball doesnt make him the best midfeilder with the system barcelon play, even my grand ma could do a better job at depicting the flow of the game than Xavi. The dude is just another overrated and over hyped media sensation. Controlling the flow of the game is what Luka Modric did in the euro against Spain for the entire 90 minute Xavi and his team couldnt be found. Xavi cannot depict the flow of the game when sitting in his own half like you just said ( regista ) possession is used in Italy and South America. hands down Xavi is a consider as a playmaker not a deep playmaker so stop google searching to make xavi look like a beast talk about what you have seen from Xavi not what you read from a blog or comment session of a article. Playmakers are people like maradona zidane Pirlo Scholes not Xavi. Xavi style of play is only suited for tik tak formation barceloan and spain plays. putting xavi in any other formation that require him to go forward with the ball and not play it back to his defenders will lead to us seeing the real xavi from Ronaldinho and Rjikard day. so far for the last four years xavi been hiding behind the tikn tak system. Against Portugal when Spain needed goal they sub the so called best playmaker because he was slowing the game from there on Spain went on strings of attack against Portugal all because xavi wasn't there to play the ball backward or delay the counter. Why do you think no teams have pursuit the singing of Xavi, it not because he expensive or in his 30 it because every manager knows he cannot fit into any other formation other than the tik tak. 




There's a reason why you don't fully rely on statistics to form an opinion on a player, because there's no statistics to tell us how a player controls a game.

That's one thing that has to be mentioned though is that we really are spending big again. Since the summer of 2010 I figured we've spent over £200Million on transfer fees alone, and we're still not done in this window because we are in need of another striker. Pressure is on RDM for sure now to get this team playing good quality football. 

It'll be interesting to see how our midfield lines up next year. Assuming RDM maintains a 4-2-3-1 formation I figured it'll most likely be a midfield partnership of Mikel and Frank, with Mikel operating as a ball winner breaking up play and Frank offering a more positive playmaker role. But I was worried we would have a proper replacement for Frank as I question how good Ramires is on the ball, he comes across as uncomposed at times and lacks the eye for a good pass. I just don't think Meireles is good enough for Chelsea. And it's to be seen whether Essien will return to playing his best football. Although I've never seen Oscar play, he's Brazilian so he's gotta be good.

I'm glad that we are investing in youth though, you only have to look at the top Spanish teams to see that youth is effective. With players like Ozil, Di Maria, Sanchez, Higuain, Benzema playing at world class levels while all still being relatively young, its the way to go!

true,scg30,1953,Frank Lampard,"&gt;There is always a need for good attacking options.

Agreed, but seriously, look at our squad. 

At the moment we currently have on our books: 

Florent Malouda 

Yossi Benayoun

Juan Mata

Daniel Sturridge

Eden Hazard

Marko Marin

Kevin de Bruyne

Gael Kakuta

Lucas Piazon

Ulises Davila 

and Josh McEachran. 

All of whom represent attacking options, and nearly all of whom are under 25 years old.

The possibility of deploying him as a deep-lying playmaker would make me feel a little better about this possible signing, as that *is* a position for which we currently have very few options. However, it would also seem to signal that the club have little to no faith in Josh's future development :( seeing as the deep-lying playmaker role was where he had shown such promise for the first team under Ancelotti. If we think of it in that light, we're pretty much paying £25m to bring in another Josh McEachran (i.e. another 20 yr old Regista in the making with little top-european experience). Granted, from what I've seen of them, Oscar's performances for Brazil at international level have been much more impressive than Josh's for England. But I would still love to see Josh given a proper chance in the first team for Chelsea, and signing Oscar to play in a deep-lying role or otherwise, would be *another* huge obstacle to that.

No, the Doctor made the mistake of trying to plop her back down where she could change Observed History (more on this later).  If he had taken them to a time and place where they could live the rest of their lives out of History's way, they would have been right as rain.  
Her subsequent suicide was just an attempt to bring history back into line.  
  
&gt; crossing back and back into your time stream is risky  
  
Yeah, that part is right up there with the Bill and Ted trick I mentioned elsewhere in this thread.  It only works if you can force a stable time loop from the beginning, and we've never seen that occur in this universe.  
  
&gt; destabilizes the Web of Time  
  
I had to look that one up.  The Web of Time is a Gallifreyan invention.  No more Gallifrey, no more Web of Time.  At one point the Doctor even says history is in flux because his people aren't around any more to keep it stable.  
    
&gt; IF we use the ""we can just go back and fix this"" excuse, there will be no story.  
  
Yeah.  That's... pretty much why I don't expect any of my frustrations to be addressed.  
  
&gt; Plus the ethical implications of- do I have the right to screw around with time and existence like that?  
  
Would I have the moral right to go back in time and save somebody's life in such a way that it doesn't damage the universe?  Absolutely.  The universe is my bitch.  
  
&gt; See he caused a glitch in the universe and brought reapers.  
  
Technically it was Rose's attempt to save him that summoned the reapers.  And that was because they weren't doing it the SMART way.  They were coming at a Historical Event head-on, so of course something Bad was going to happen.  Hell, they even observed the crash once before Rose tried to change things.  Talk about a Dumb Idea.  
  
&gt; You can't just put a fake father in there to die. The universe isn't a person- it isn't fooled like that. It's the very fabric of existence- it'll know when something is the original or not.  
  
Bad Things happen when you try to tamper with time.  But the only way anybody can know what's wrong or right is by observing it.  If there's no obseration, there's no paradox.  
  
If somebody sees events unfolding one way, then goes back in time and changes it (Rose, I'm looking at you), Bad Things Happen, because you just observed a different timeline.  One or the other must be false in a self-consistant universe (which is what the Blinovitch Limitation Effect seems to enforce).  
  
BUT!  All this means is you have to be careful about what you observe first-hand.  If you see something bad happen, all that means is what you observed Has To Happen.  If you see a person with your father's face get hit by a car, then that Absolutely Has To Happen.  If your mother tells you about your father's death, then history has to happen in such a way that she still tells you those stories.

When you come stay in the city centre, get down to a pub called Mary D's 2-3 hours before kick off and take that it, then you'll want to head down to the ground a bit before kick off and have a walk around, get some photos and have a pie. Turn up early enough and see the players arrive maybe? 

Talk to people, in the pub/ground people will be mad friendly. Also don't deck yourself out. A shirt and scarf maybe, dress warm. I would personally avoid looking overly tourist but that's a personal thing. Buy stuff after the game not before.

Also, because I'm a platinum member I can buy tickets on the city exchange. So if you can't get one through the ticket office I can maybe get you one at the last minute. Always towts around as well but they cost a bomb.

Just because the Time Lords are gone doesn't mean the Web of Time is. They just don't maintain it anymore. Plus, it's not confirmed that the Web is gone. It's probably useless now...since its only purpose was to help the TLs keep their grip on the verse. But it would still be pretty bad if that thing broke. It's probably helping to keep important/good things in place. If it breaks, crap could get loose. Now that the TLs aren't around to maintain it, it's probably getting all kinds of glitches and paradoxes stuck in it...

&gt;Yeah. That's...pretty much why I don't expect any of my frustrations to be addressed.

I don't see why they're even frustrations. Besides the fact that all these things you have a problem with make sense to me, I just assume that time is too complex and varied for us to understand. Plus I assume that the Whoniverse is a separate universe from our own and its physics might work a bit differently. I mean it is a fictional universe after all.

As for Rose's dad, I guess you're not talking about fixed points. Well the Blinovitch L. Effect isn't being broken here, because in the end, he did die and Rose saw him die. Just as it was meant to happen- she mentions how her mom saw this blonde haired girl with him. Again I don't see the problem you have with this at all.

true,scg30,1953,Frank Lampard,"Possibly not, but as things currently stand that is our squad.

Ulises Davila is already on loan and definitely will be gone next year.

Piazon seems a bit young for the first team and will probably spend another year in the reserves or on loan, but he has been given a shot to impress this pre-season and could remain with the first squad if he pulls something amazing out of his ass in America.

Kakuta should remain with the first team or be sold, imo. He's paid his dues on loan, impressing for Dijon last year, and has really developed physically. This is his time to prove he's good enough for Chelsea.

Kevin de Bruyne has been given the number 14 and appears to be in Robbie's and Roman's plans for the first team next year. People have suggested he should be loaned out, but he's 21 years old, impressed against us in the UCL last year, getting the best of Bosingwa repeatedly, and we paid £7m for him(a sensible, yet not small, fee for a youngster). I think he'll see substantial playing time as a winger next season.

Wee Josh is an interesting case. I personally would like to see him kept on with the first team playing and training as a 3rd string deep-lying playmaker in the double-pivot behind Lampard and another, quality/proven CM passer who our squad as yet does not possess, (like a Modric or a Moutinho). A lot will depend on how he performs in this pre-season and how highly Robbie rates him. He could very well end up out on a season-long loan spell somewhere, and that might not be the worst thing for him.

Marko Marin and Eden Hazard are clearly in the frame, as are Daniel Sturridge and Juan Mata.

Benayoun could go, and that would be fine with me. But I also wouldn't be surprised to see him stay on and become a sort of Paulo Ferreira of our attacking midfield: a solid quality pro with a good attitude/ethic, and an experienced head, solid when called upon and doesn't mind just playing his part.

As for Flo, no one seems willing to meet his high wage demands given his age and declining form, and lord knows he seems perfectly happy to warm the bench at Chelsea and keep collecting those wages at the current rate for the remainder of his contract. We basically begged Santos to take him, and they just couldn't because his wages are too high. I'd like to see him moved on, but I'm afraid we might be stuck with him for another year. If that's the case I can only hope he pulls out some sort of vintage swan-song routine.",0,1342473495,null,0,false,0,c5exgtd,t3_wno5y,t1_c5exgtd,t1_c5ex49d,null,1429392197,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,ffhfhffh,null,null,"Actually, many scientists have been begging for this for years, and are overjoyed that it's finally happening.

Generally, academics have control over their own funds and how to spend them. When applying for grants, they outline their costs in advance, and then they either get approved or declined. Under the system, every UK research group would add a few thousand pounds a year to their grant applications (which are in the millions).

The real benefit of this system is that the scientist making the decision of which journal to publish in is also the one paying for it. This introduces cost-based competition into the publishing industry that has been sorely lacking, and has lead to astronomical subscription costs. Nature currently charge in the region of $10,000 for an open access paper, but this is obviously artificially inflated due to poor competition in the marketplace. PLoSOne do it for about $1,500, and the true cost of checking for typos, contacting peer reviewers and typesetting a PDF is in the region of $100 tops. We're also seeing some really innovative business models come out of this. One is [PeerJ](http://peerj.com), which offers lifetime publishing for $99 per author.

You are right that it will be a little more expensive during the transition period, but the momentum is behind this worldwide. For example, all research funded by the NIH in America already has this requirement (about $32 billion), and work funded by the Wellcome trust does as well (about $1 billion). With literally *all* UK publicly funded research in open access journals, subscription costs are going to fall dramatically, along with current ""necessity"" to subscribe to every journal under the sun. Also, the benefit members of the public and scientists that work outside large institutions is huge.

Personally, I am really not pleased with the turn the show has taken since Moffat took over. Seasons 5 and 6 are just not my cup of tea.

When I was in your position, I was constantly told by people, ""if you like it now, just WAIT till you get to Season 5 and 6!"" I was told the production value increases, Matt Smith was incredible, the adventures were amazing, and the relationship between Amy and the Doctor is fresh.

What I found after starting Season 5 was a TARDIS console room that looked like the set of a Disney show, rainbow colored daleks, a decent yet underwhelming interpretation of the Doctor (which improved overtime though), adventure filled with plot holes, and a stale overused ""companion is in love with the Doctor"" story arc.

My girlfriend (who loved the series) ended up giving up on the show halfway through season 5 and hasn't been back since.  I had to take a break from it as well because it simple wasn't the same show.

I understand that Doctor Who is a show all about change and changing the Doctor, but the changes made between Season 4 and 5 were just too jarring for me. I felt like it was almost insulting the older seasons at times. I just didn't understand what was so wonderful about Season 5 and 6 that warranted the glowing recommendations from so many people. Many episodes left me more frustrated than excited, and I begrudgingly finished Season 6 just so I would have a complete knowledge of the show before judging it and commenting on it, but both Season 5 and 6 left me extremely underwhelmed. It was missing the charm for me, and I never got that feeling back.

Matt Smith's version of the Doctor seems more bumbling, absent minded, and not heroic.  Coming off of Tennant playing the Doctor as a natural Hero, it seems like you are getting a weak Doctor.  In Season 5 alone, there were only a handful of episodes where it seemed like the Doctor actually DID anything. That made him look weak in my eyes.  When his companion is the one saving the day on the second episode, it tarnishes my respect for the Doctor. And that is hard to get back when each episode gives me another thing to complain about.

I am also not a fan of his companion for Season 5 and 6.  Amy is what I consider to be the absolutely worst companion I have watched.  No fault to Karen Gillan, but the character is just a mess.  Her motivations change from episode to episode to what is convenient for the plot.  One episode she might be tough and fearless to give the episode an adventure-y feel to it, but in the next she is scared and running away and hiding to give the episode a more scary feel.  Not to mention her drawn out love of the Doctor which we already saw with Rose AND Martha. I don't want to spoil too much for you, but from the very first episode of Season 5 she annoyed me with her actions and she hasn't stopped since. In fact, Amy seems to be the focus of the show more than the Doctor at times.  

Then we get to River Song, who is just a train wreck. Her over the top entrances and hammy acting ruin any kind of atmosphere an episode has going for it.  She is wedged into stories to basically flirt with the Doctor and run around in a slinky dress. Her character is a completely embarrassment to Doctor Who.

HOWEVER, that's not to say Season 5 and 6 are BAD. There are a few episodes I did actually enjoy from those Seasons and I'm sure I'm just being overly negative because I'm so let down. They are fine seasons, but don't go in expecting to be blown away. Moffat has dropped the ball both seasons on his season-long story arcs for me.  They fell flat and disappointed me.  I couldn't believe this was coming from the same man who wrote The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, and Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (some of my favorites).  It was as if the show had become a parody of itself. 

I suggest watching them, as discussion of all the episodes is a great thing to have with friends and on the boards, and without watching all of the episodes you can't truly discuss the show. Since you and I seem to have similar feelings going into Season 5, I would be curious to know your take on the show after the changes.  If you like them, then that is wonderful and you can continue to enjoy the show! If you hate them, then you can discuss your reasons and try to get explanations from fans as to how the various plot holes actually make sense. Please give them a go, and let us know what you think.  I think you'll know after a few episodes if you are going to like it or not. The quality, writing style, and production don't really change between the Season 5 premiere and the Season 6 finale.",0,1342474015,null,0,false,0,c5exlju,t3_wmvk1,t1_c5exlju,t3_wmvk1,null,1429392262,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

He scored a hat trick in a comeback, extra-time victory in the 2011 U20 World Cup Final, all from an advanced midfield position.

In a match between two teams with some of the best under 20 talent in the world, Oscar was the best player on the pitch by a mile.

He got his first cap for Brazil at 19 years old, and he has 6 appearances and a goal despite only being 20 years old. If you can be capped and played by a Brazil squad with this much talent, you're on the path to being a great player in my book.

Obviously he is still young, but it looks like he is turning into the player that everybody thought Ganso would become. Great passer, smart player, nose for goal, leads by example.

Walcott is not a good fit for our new system. He's a cracking, pacy, cutting-in type forward, but he is not a smart player. He has woeful positional sense, absolute no idea when to pass and when to run and is probably the least tactially understanding player in the Arsenal squad.

If Arsene Wenger's years of work and support for Walcott (which has been excellent) has been unable to convert him into a smart pass and move player, then there's more hope of us training Jamie Carragher into a bombadiering winger.

While we need attacking players, Walcott really isn't what we want. He would become the most expensive signing of the transfer window and as it stands, he would be direct competition for suarez and borini up front. Since that's where all our most recent and most useful investment has been, why add another when there are other areas of the squad to be strengthened on an already admittedly limited transfer budget.

We have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to offer walcott over Arsenal. Walcott is an increasingly large part of the Gunners plans. We have already stressed that we're going to keep to a good wage structure like arsenal. We can't offer champions league football or any more realistic title challenge. He's a native londoner.

Regardless of what people may have heard, Arsenal by no means need the transfer funds to either balance their books or to buy extra depth for the squad.

true,daveduckman,null,null,"&gt;Even the most sensible football fans are guilty of over-simplifying complex issues. The Andy Carroll dilemma is far from straightforward and difficult to solve.

Is the end to an article that does exactly that.

* Claiming Rodgers new from day one what he was going to do with Andy Carroll is absurd. This isn't football manager where the moment you start at a new club you get a perfect readout of all their stats and their mental conditioning, you need time to actually assess the players and to see what else is available. This is evidenced in the limbo the cole, aquilani, rodriguez, bellamy, sigurdsson and others have existed in this season. We don't have a blank cheque book, we don't have massive pulling power, and we clearly don't have a squad that is ideal to the Rodger's dream system. Rodger's is simply assessing all the options and deciding what is the most expedient based on the options that are available to him and what the potential financial benefits/consequences of moving certain players are. He's not a zealot who knew day 1 who was going to leave, he's simply speaking as someone who has no emotional attachment to a player he didn't sign and gave a broad answer about being open to anything.

* ""with fans thirsty for a premier league title"" (you could at least say 'cup' to complete the metaphor). No kopite with even a grain of reason expects us to win the premier league this season. Nor does anyone's rationale run ""oh, well if we're going for a european position i'd let carroll linger around, but I want a title and so Carroll's got to go"". Whether we were fending off relegation or focusing on a champions cup, we would still want the same set of players (ie the best for the club). The motivator is not the desire to win things, but the desire to play a different brand of football.

* To suggest it is goals alone that are Carroll's failure is a gross simplification. No one is saying Carroll has got to go because he's not clinical enough. Sure if he was hitting in 30 goals a season, then we wouldn't be having the conversation. But that's not the point, Carroll is under pressure not because he can't score goals, but because the skills and attributes he brings to the team (footwork, pace, high pressure attacking, pass and move game) are lacking. If he looked more promising (not to say that he isn't) in any of those domains he would stay, even if he was scoring less.

* A loan move is not neccessarily about developing a player. If we truly wanted Carroll to develop and improve so he can return to our team, we would loan him out to either swansea or wigan. What possible benefit to Carroll fitting into out pass and move style of football would there be in sending him to play for Sam Allardyce's West Ham or a similar proposition? Since we're obviously not going to get a massive fee for a loan move (in fact probably far less than is required to even sign a backup striker let alone a replacement) and probably not even 100% of his wages, there is far greater rationale to keep him in the squad and see if he can adapt. The primary role of a loan move would be to 'fatten our cow for market' let him get game time and sit in the shop window, hoping that we can get a better price for him in january or next year when he's played a bit more and the bigger clubs are looking for a striker.

* The entire article places far too much emphasis on the apparent role the fan opinion plays on motivating the new manager's decisions. Rodgers isn't going to be thinking ""well it's much easier for me to justify letting go of Carroll now than be seen as a failure with him after a few months and then have to sell him off"". Nor will it be ""well I can't have a 35mil lad sitting on the bench or the fans will 'thrust their hardened judgement' into me."" The owners have made it clear that this is year 0 of a new project and that gives all the cover required to experiment and do what they think is best with a ""trust us, we know what we're doing"" carte blanche. The decision to keep players like cole and aquilani becuase no one will give us enough for them while fan favourites on similar wages kuyt and rodriguez were allowed to leave is emblematic of a pragmatic, future orientated approach than any desire to appease the ill-informed and short-termist fans who think that one good transfer window is all we need to challenge for a title again.",0,1342479363,null,0,false,0,c5eyx4y,t3_wne6a,t1_c5eyx4y,t3_wne6a,null,1429392895,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Each season has an underlying story that develops across multiple episodes building to the finale, but most episodes are almost entirely stand alone.  Additionally each season usually has at least one (and sometimes two) two-part episodes, with the finale also usually coming in two or three parts.

Also, once season 5 starts and Steve Moffat takes over as show-runner, the show starts getting *a lot* more serialized.  Season 6 wasn't quite in Game of Thrones territory, but it was definitely the most serialized season of the show to date.  The overarching season long plot has definitely been much more front and center under Moffat's run during seasons 5 and 6 than it every really was in seasons 1 through 4 under Russell T. Davies.

That said, I think you'll enjoy season 1's Bad Wolf arc.  It's a subtle presence in most of the episodes, but it's still quite fun.

My point, however badly made, was rather that you wouldn't really consider ""twat"" a classist insult of the rich, as class, in the first place, because it's so clearly targeted at a specific subset of rich people. Most rich people are not twats - well, ok, *many* rich people are not twats. ;-) Similarly, many or most working class people are not chavs - so why interpret ""chav"" as a slam on the working class and the poor, categorically?

Like, I dunno .. think about the various stereotypes that exist about working class people, because there's a whole bunch, good and bad, not just in England. Take a soap series ... take, like, Eastenders or eh, does Coronation Street still exist? Those are chock-full of stereotypes, because that's what soap series are all about, right? They need to represent the full range of stereotypes to make the viewers feel they know exactly what's going on. But how much of the cast of Eastenders would you describe as ""chavs""? I mean, I dunno, I can't get it here, so I only watch it like twice a year or something, but aren't almost all of Eastenders' characters working class, but less than half what one would call ""chavs""? Wouldn't many working class Brits in fact also disdain and distinguish themselves from a subset of ""chavs,"" based on distinctions in style and behavior?

If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a month, and no one could do anything about it, pretty soon there'd be all sorts of philosophers, pretending to be wise as you put it, who found all sorts of amazing benefits to being hit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you tougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you're not getting hit with a truncheon. But if you went up to someone who wasn't getting hit, and you asked them if they wanted to start, in exchange for those amazing benefits, they'd say no. And if you didn't have to die, if you came from somewhere that no one had ever even heard of death, and I suggested to you that it would be an amazing wonderful great idea for people to get wrinkled and old and eventually cease to exist, why, you'd have me hauled right off to a lunatic asylum! So why would anyone possibly think any thought so silly as that death is a good thing? Because you're afraid of it, because you don't really want to die, and that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to rationalize it away, do something to numb the pain, so you won't have to think about it -""",0,1342486723,null,0,false,0,c5f0lyi,t3_wmu2w,t1_c5f0lyi,t1_c5ezs6y,null,1429393677,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"Aight, got your back bros.

I'm going to try to be as objective as I possibly can, so here goes.

Salo has the potential to be the greatest player my country has produced up to now.

Please not that this sounds more impressive than it actually is, considering we're kinda shite. But in any case, he's a solid player, I think. His goal tally in 2010-11 was higher than this past season, but they also went on their spending spree last summer, and Rondon was one of the few players from the 2010-11 squad to retain his place, although Van Nistelrooy was preferred towards the beginning, and this past season they had more scoring outlets, resulting in him not being the focus of the attack quite as much.

In any case, as far as how he actually plays, he's a big, physical, target man-type player with decent technique. He's capable of taking on a defender one on one with the ball at his feet too, if need be, but normally plays with his back to goal (I think that in La Liga, only 3 or 4 forwards won aerial duels more often than he did). His positioning and runs have improved a lot in the past year or so, but his finishing is still poor at times, and passing isn't the best part of his game (although to be fair, his passing success rate is higher than that of players in a similar mold like Drogba). Compared to Ade, who would be his main competition here, he's a more physical presence despite not being as tall (186 vs 191 cm), wins more aerial duels and finishes at a similar rate, although Ade has the slight edge. Ade created more chances this season too, but Rondon gets dispossesed far less often and has a better first touch imo.

How would I feel about the signing? As a Venezuelan, I'd be ecstatic. As a Tottenham fan, it'd be a signing for a year or two down the line. He's not the statement striker signing we're looking for right now, though. Barring another breakthrough season with him, I don't believe he'd start over Ade, but given his consistent development, in 2 or 3 years he could be massive for us. If Malaga are actually in financial trouble and are looking to make some quick cash, we might be able to get him for somewhere in the range of 5-7m pounds, which I think would be worth it as a young, developing striker. He's 22 right now, so assuming he continues improving, he could be worked into the starting lineup as Ade approaches 30. He's still young, and from what I've seen, receptive to different training methods, comparing the NT and Pellegrini's style.

So overall, for a cheap price, he could be a solid squad player with the potential to work his way into the starting lineup in a year or two and would give us another big man up front to work with in case Ade goes down or needs a rest. He's done equally well when being the focus of the attack and when responsibility has been spread around, so I don't think he'll have a difficult time adjusting to not being the main guy. But he's not our big signing, and unless he impresses a considerable amount in training, I don't think he'd start at first either.

Honestly, if I were going to take anyone from Malaga, it would be Cazorla. He can play anywhere in midfield (he's even been slotted in at CDM, where he did well), but he's an outstanding right winger. Not the fastest, but he's a tricky player that can create for himself and others. Probably the best La Liga player outside of Madrid and Barcelona, imo. He'd be a bit more expensive (rated around 17m pounds on transfermarkt), but I feel like Levy could haggle down to 15m or so.",0,1342488631,null,0,false,0,c5f11ps,t3_wo1v3,t1_c5f11ps,t1_c5ezkv7,null,1435700821,18,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,18

He's 23 years old and already he's a monstrous forward, capable of being truly unplayable at times. Look at how he bossed Terry around in the 2 Chelsea games at the end of the season. Did you see any other player at the Euros give Terry as hard a time?

And forwards like him, who don't rely on out and out pace, tend to improve until they are 30 or so.

Look at Didier Drogba. Where was he when he was 23? He was finishing a 4 year spell at French 2nd Division side Le Mans where he managed 12 goals in 64 appearances. Carroll is way ahead of that in terms of current development.

It takes time for a player (especially if young) to settle into any side. Last season was a tough, rebuilding one, for the whole club and OP is correct in stating that he was showing huge mental toughness in overcoming a big pricetag and showing signs of improvement towards the end of the season. 

No one has mentioned how useful he was defending from set pieces and the shear confusion he caused last season in the opponents box should have counted for at least a couple of assists I can think of. 

I fear we'll get rid of him after a slight suspect start to his Anfield career, only for him to turn into a world class physical centre forward. 

Even if he's not playing every week, I'd much prefer to see him stay and at least be given a chance under Rodgers. I feel he currently offers a great tactical option to our squad and I'm pretty sure he'll only get better as he learns his role with time.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"I appreciate the desire to defend our players and I really wish it worked out for him but there are certain realities we have to deal with:

1)  If Andy leaves it will not be that he wasn't ""given a chance under our new manager.""  It will be that our new manager decided not to give him a chance.  Everyone feared that we would bring in a Director of Football that would take these decisions away from the manager (something I personally don't think would be too bad) but we didn't so you cannot separate the personnel decisions from the manager's decisions.

2)  There are only eleven starting spots and, at most, three strikers.  If the manager feels that there are better options available, either from within the club or on the transfer market, then it the manager's responsibility to play those players, regardless of past transfer fees or ""fairness.""

3)  A player's technique can be underrated but still not good enough.  People believe Andy has no technique and that is not true but it is true that his technique is poor for a striker on team that wants/needs/expects to be playing in the Champions League and wants to do it with a passing heavy style.

4)  Sometimes players just aren't a good fit on a team.  It happens.  It doesn't mean the player isn't good or doesn't work hard or that the team is doing something wrong.  Most players have personal strengths and most teams have a chosen style.  If those things don't match up it is sometimes best for the player and team to look for a better situation that benefits both.

5)  Kenny may have taken Andy as a protege but Kenny isn't the manager any more.  Kenny undoubtedly knew how to BE a striker but we don't know if he ""knows"" modern strikers.  We didn't score enough goals last season.  That's just a fact and Andy's poor play was a significant part of that.

I personally like Andy.  He seems to work hard, have a desire to improve, and to have taken steps to put some his past issues behind him.  If Rodgers decides that it is best for the club to retain him then I will, of course, root for him to succeed.  If we decide that it is best to move him on then I will continue to root for him 36 times a season as I do for most former Reds.  It's not a personal attack on him, I just want the team to win games and move forward and part of doing that is giving the current manager the opportunity to shape the philosophy, style and roster of the club as he sees fit.",0,1342490585,null,0,1342492444,0,c5f1ix2,t3_woc6n,t1_c5f1ix2,t3_woc6n,null,1429394108,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

Third, Death's Head has tangled with Hulk. [Link the second](http://i41.tinypic.com/2hs5g5c.jpg) (from scans-daily.dreamwidth.org)

Summary: The Doctor is 2 degrees (Death's Head to Hulk, Hulk to Nick Fury) from joining the Avengers. Or, more likely (because he's the Doctor), the Doctor is however close to joining the Avengers as he wishes.

The real question is: Is this canon? (Which is no small [question](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Death%27s_Head_%281988%29#The_Doctor_and_the_Marvel_universe) (from tardis.wikia.com))",0,1342491154,null,0,false,0,c5f1o0o,t3_wn5v4,t1_c5f1o0o,t3_wn5v4,null,1429394179,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Urgh. I am going to have to disclaimer my *opinions* again. That I'm commenting on a fictional character not a person so this isn't an insult. And it's not really off topic to the thread. So people shouldn't be downvoting because- *oh my god*- I don't know who he is and a random screenshot of him imparts no magical knowledge into my brain of his cultural significance. Because I am not a clone of everybody here meaning I may not know everything everybody else knows. Or else the human race could just have each person focus on one topic and we'd know everything.

Seriously, this is worse than people downvoting controversial opinions. This is like Twilight fans or any other kind of hardcore fan who cannot accept the idea that you don't share their enthusiasm for something.

As far as i can tell, unless we get a very *decent* offer for him before July 23, Andy will be given the chance to prove he can play this style of football during pre season. Remember the window is open till september, this could well drag on till then. I can't see anyone putting up £20m for him right now so i expect he's got a season at Anfield yet.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"To me, the most important reason to keep Andy Carroll is not necessarily the goals he may score, the flick-on assists he may provide, or even justifying his transfer fee.

When describing the Euros, another poster on another forum I frequent commented that ""Portugal is a team that only has a Plan A. Spain is another team that only has a Plan A. The difference is, Portugal's plan isn't good enough"". Although Spain might have something of a Plan B with Torres, the idea is clear. We're not Spain.

Even if Andy Carroll cannot pass to save his life (which I don't believe) and our passing game works 9 times out of 10, there will be complications. There will be teams that we just can't break down. There will be days when we're off, or have injuries. Andy Carroll may or may not be an important member of Plan A, but he will always be the focal point of Plan B. With our attacking movement on the wings, we can put balls into the box from touch. Andy can beat defenders in the air. If passing the ball around isn't working, we can shake things up.

Our game works beautifully sometimes (See Suarez hat trick against Norwich, Gerrard against Everton, post FA Cup final against Chelsea). Other times it doesn't. Part of our struggle last season was not having a solid backup plan, and I think Andy Carroll can provide that. Unless we can sign an absurdly good player with the money, our best option is to hold onto Andy and work at developing his Plan A game, and becoming a useful Plan B.",0,1342495333,null,0,false,0,c5f2os5,t3_woc6n,t1_c5f2os5,t3_woc6n,null,1429394662,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

 is a link to his filmography, probably best known for his work in Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, Stripes, Lost in Translation, and my personal favorite Groundhog's Day, although you have probably seen him in a few other roles.

He first rose to prominence as an original cast member of the show Saturday Night Live.

Bill Murray also has a rather large internet following due to the abundance of anecdotal stories surrounding him, such as the ones detailed [here.](http://www.billmurraystory.com/tag/no-one-will-ever-believe-you/)

Another enduring reason for his popularity is that most of the stories about him depict him as a cool down to earth guy who hasn't let the celebrity go to his head and he is still entertaining both on screen and off.

I was going to write some pithy thing asking how you could have lived your entire life and not heard about him, but then I remembered we don't all share the same experiences and some things we have taken for granted could be completely alien to another person.

I'll elaborate. For one thing, most people cannot afford to buy them. For another, it's a great way to advertise. I've downloaded things before, and often I've found I liked them so much, I went out and bought them. And I've spent hundreds of dollars based on the premise of downloading something then going and seriously buying it. Doctor Who things.

Also, that's how I watched the classic series. And it hasn't stopped me from buying stories I really like. With sites on the net we can get people interested in classic Who enough to discuss it and buy it.

Neil Gaiman is the one who told me this- that letting people see/read uploaded stuff, lets them sample it and decide to buy it. Like seeing songs on youtube you like. I'm against uploading things and sometimes downloading them (depending on content), but I don't see anything wrong with watching what's been uploaded.

Especially when it's so hard to watch classic Who. Buying thousands of dollars worth of DVDs. Plus, not all of them are for sale. Or even in some countries.

People: wonderful/awful/inspirational/vacuous/bigoted/kind Creatures

Q - Do we import a huge and unceasing supply to jewish emigrants?

A - No, surely there is a clue in there somewhere.

I want no-one living in Britain to be subject to unjust abuse, regardless of their religion, but if the principle goal of government is the welfare and wellbeing of its citizens - and less-advantaged citizens identify an influx of muslim (brown) people as 'flooding' the areas they live in, and decreasing the social cohesion of the community they depend upon - then surely the answer is to reduce immigration.

The fact they they might be muslim is, in and of itself, a canard, the repetition of which does nothing to get to the root of the problem. The 'visible' immigrants tend to be brown (and muslim), thus they are branded the problem.

Why did i put the description of people above? Because, regardless of their flawed judgement, unless we have no faith in the judgement and competence of the electorate to partake in indirect democracy, then government must respond to their demands.

The scale, and uncontrolled nature, of immigration is reducing the welfare and wellbeing of a significant chunk of the electorate, or at least they perceive it as so, and they are lashing out inappropriately.

Want a solution? Reduce immigration

Hopefully then, immigrants of all stripes can pursue their lives in Britain free from injustice.

The windows are surely boarded up because it's an adult-entertainment licensing requirement, and because it's not a modern building - it had to be retrofitted. I guess this pub was built around WWII, and it must have seen a lot of passing trade before the M1 was opened. I rather admire the licensee for finding a way to keep it viable in changing times - of the many pubs built on other A-roads throughout the country during this era, so many are now derelict.

Inside it's very much a regular pub, and you'll find a few locals there around the pool table and travelling salesmen taking in the atmosphere. 

Compare it with Phoenix Club someone else has mentioned and (although I haven't visited Phoenix) I find the cheesy strip bar much more genuine. Like Louisblack85's mate, I stop there for just one shandy any time I'm passing (which isn't that often, unfortunately). The cheesy strip bar is a real pub inside, with with added bonus of naked ladies, and it charges a fair price for a drink. 

If you live in Milton Keynes, Phoenix clearly makes a lot more sense, but I'll bet it's a much more expensive night out.

We were guided by the greatest quarterback of all time, Joe Montana, to 4 Super Bowl titles in the 80s, who was coached by ""The Genius"", Bill Walsh. He went undefeated in Championship games, which is pretty remarkable. The Montana to Jerry Rice (greatest receiver of all time, as well) combination may never be topped. Montana was succeeded by Steve Young, who won us another one in 94/95. We've had a long and frustrating road since 2001, but experienced somewhat of a rebirth last season under our new coach Jim Harbaugh. We got to the NFC Championship game, and lost to the eventual champions on a fumbled punt. The names in this paragraph are essential for any Niner fan. 

We play our home games at Candlestick Park, which is a dreadful place to see a game. The team is moving to Santa Clara because they couldn't get approval from the city to build a new stadium.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"The thing with LIBOR is that it's a factor in nearly *every* financial product out there. Mortgages, loans, derivatives, all of them use LIBOR as a base for their cost/rates to a lesser or greater extent so fixing it means that you're fixing things way beyond your original target. As for who overpaid/underpaid it's very hard to disentangle as LIBOR applies to so much. However, what we do know is this:

In the first instance of LIBOR being fiddled it was largely the US municiple bond market that got fleeced. The Muni Bonds are basically IOU's written by the governments of American cities and I won't get into too much detail because it starts sounding very complicated very quickly. In essence it's not, but finance likes to make things less than straight forward. Anyway, the long and short of it that the cities would often make loans to banks as a 'hedge' (so sort of as an insurance policy in case interest rates went up unexpectedly) and the interest that the banks have to pay Detroit for these loans are pegged against LIBOR. By manipulating LIBOR down, the banks then pay an artificially low rate of interest which is in effect free money for them: Free money that the cities could have otherwise spent on health care, schools, the common good, etc.

The other part of the LIBOR scandal was more straight forward and followed the 2008 crisis where everyone thought that the entire banking system was going to collapse. LIBOR is important here because it's basically like a bank's heart and blood pressure reading. If it posts high LIBOR figures that means it is in trouble and has to pay more to borrow. Again, Barclay's (and most likely many other banks) manipulated their LIBOR figures down to give the impression that they were healthier than they were and that they could borrow at a cheaper rate.

Why is this important? Because it breaks the market. The banks are the first people to scream about how great the free market is and how governments should stop messing with it yet a free market can only work if there are objective and impartial ways to measure things like risk. LIBOR was supposed to be one of those objective measures but in reality it wasn't. It was being fiddled and that fiddle affected *everyone*. As to how it affected people is a question so big that it would take years to work out but basically some people would end up paying over the odds, some would pay under. However, the fundamental point is the banks did it explicitly for their own gain and without heed to the consequences for everyone else.",0,1342521640,null,0,false,0,c5f6rio,t3_wohs3,t1_c5f6rio,t1_c5f6g79,null,1429396649,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There are eleven starting spots but there is a definite need for rotation, particularly with the Europa League this year. 

Selling him or sending him out on loan will most definitely leave us light in the strikers department. Yes, we now have Borini and we of course have Suarez, but realistically who else in the squad could you consider a striker (and I'm talking first team quality only; i.e. not reserves)? I've intentionally excluded Bellamy because he cannot be a consistent starter and his tenure is under doubt.

Quite simply, you create a flat-tax where everyone pays the same. No loopholes, no exemptions, nothing.

As you are now taxing the poor at a higher rate, you create a benefits system that refunds their taxes - and often can refund more so they are on a negative rate.

However, you also cut the percentage rate applied to the rich. Ignore the fact that they are paying more cash, all people will see is headlines about ""poor people paying more and rich paying less"".

That it means more money for the government from the rich, and that in cash terms, the poor pay less - wont matter. All people will see is snide headlines.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Well here's the thing:It's next to impossible that Barclays could manipulate LIBOR on their own. The simple verson of how LIBOR works is that every London based banks submits a figure each day saying how much people are asking in interest to loan them money and then an average is taken which gives you the LIBOR figure. There's over 20 banks involved so just one under/over reporting isn't really going to affect the overall rate very much (especially as the 2 highest and 2 lowest rates are excluded from the calculation) so other banks had to be in on it as well. Barclay's is the first to be caught out but they won't be the last by a long shot.

So how do you fix it? Basically you regulate it properly. At the moment the body that collates the LIBOR figure is the British Bankers Association, a non-statutory industry body. The BBA were willing to take bankers at their word on LIBOR but clearly that was foolhardy. So if you really wanted to fix it you'd have to appoint a statutory regulatory body who have access to the banks books and the teeth to enforce their will. Will that happen? Most likely not. The banks will howl and gnash their teeth about the state meddling with the free market/having access to commercially sensitive data and use the usual threats of ""we'll just move some place else"" and the politicians will cave.

Their structure is built around the squad consisting of team players, not standout superstars.

From a [Soccernet](http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1088771/arsenal-alter-wage-structure-to-land-?cc=3436) article on how Arsenal want to change their structure:

&gt; ""Our wage structure has been based around a flatter salary structure - that is part of a team ethos the manager develops, it's about interaction between players - not superstars.

So *most* of the Arsenal squad of 30 players is earning close to what is the maximum contract at Spurs.

from [this post](http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/john-cross/The-Arsenal-column-Why-Gunners-hope-copying-Manchester-United-s-wage-structure-will-help-keep-stars-like-Robin-van-Persie-by-John-Cross-article868943.html):

&gt; It is important to stress that there is no wage cap or formalised structure at Arsenal. Just a long held belief by Arsene Wenger that there should be some kind of equilibrium among players who share the same dressing room.

Last year Liverpool and Arsenal wage bills were [around the same](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WhbOhsr4oLY/T_p_CuBIOQI/AAAAAAAAGFA/HuIiZ-7y0_k/s640/21+Utd+Wages+Growth.jpg). Since then, we have almost completed our project to remove the 25M or so of deadwood we have in the squad, which will bring us back to around 90M prior to the new signings and new contracts (Suarez, Skrtel and Agger) this window.

Arsenal themselves are[abandoning their own wage structure](http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/john-cross/The-Arsenal-column-Why-Gunners-hope-copying-Manchester-United-s-wage-structure-will-help-keep-stars-like-Robin-van-Persie-by-John-Cross-article868943.html) this summer because it simply doesn't work. If you take a peek into /r/gunners or their supporter blogs, you will find that prominent supporters have been appealing for their wage structure to be abandoned, and have been doing so for years. Because of the number of contracts, their size, and their terms, it will take Arsenal 2-4 years to clear their books and implement a competitive structure similar to City and United.

You can't call yourself a fucking expat if you're relying on government funding.

If he came with money in his pockets from Saudi Arabia to study at Oxford or Cambridge then he can scream 'expat' til his voice is hoarse. 

Whats more if you have no capital you can't call yourself an expat. Expats typically retire where they want to after spending a huge chunk of their savings buying their dream home. They still are living off their pension they paid into for however many years so money is coming into an area. 

That's the key defining feature of an expat because in order to live they rely on being a citizen of their own country to retain a pension they paid into for most of their working life and spending a huge chunk of those savings to buy property where they want. Money comes in every month from their pension so they don't take away any jobs yet they have no interest in becoming a citizen of that country as they would lose their pension.

I think you're getting confused between two concepts. The IOC requires this protection in order to protect The Olympics brand. The bidders for sponsorship are obviously interested in promoting their brand above all else, but they are not the people responsible for requiring this law.

&gt; But that's not the real problem, I don't think. Like others said, that's what the olympics is, and that's what you have to expect.

Agreed.

&gt; I think what gets people is that the way our government seems so eager to please the sponsors, and to chase the money, it's indicative of all the things that's wrong with this country.

This is a weak copout ('all the things that are wrong'). The Olympics come part and parcel with strong laws to protect the brand, the same as they require the investment in broadcast and transport infrastructure. The building of whole stadiums. The government is trying to push an aggressive austerity policy, and so any economic activity, especially making the UK the focus of worldwide attention seems good in their eyes. I don't consider this some barometer of failure, and I have literally no interest in the Olympics.

&gt; I think it's just bad timing, really. 4 years earlier, and I think these Olympics would have had a much better reception.

true,FishbeardWaddy,lfc55,,"A bit of non article really as we had one of the best defences in the league last year which was because of the passing game we played. Our passing game is only going to get better under Buck and that will only ensure the the opponent should see less of the ball and our defence should have less to do.

One of Rodgers' key philosophies is defending with possession, this is the art of passing and dribbling it out from defence as this keeps the team in possession and allows the team to pass out of pressure and rest on the ball. Rodgers will out law the hoofing the ball out/clear by defenders unless it's really necessary as when you kick the ball up field it more often than not falls back to the opposition and once again you are put under pressure without a chance to compose yourself.

This is the philosophy Guardiola lives by at Barca, the philosophy Bielsa when he was at Chile and what Rodgers tried to do at Swansea. You can see the success it has brought to all three teams to varying degrees and I can safely safe we have a much better quality of player than Swansea and Chile whilst Agger and to an extent Johnson wouldn't look out of place in a Barce team so defence will not be an issue under Rodgers' ""Tiki-Taka"" style.

2. Its uncouth to shout about how amazing you are. Which is basically what overt patriotism is. British people are often rather reserved and self effacing.

But when the new owner, [Zhu Jun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Jun_%28businessman%29), came in, he basically tore the club apart.  He failed at money management and had to sell top players, causing the team to fall from 3rd in 2010 to 11th last year out of 16 teams.

It's been tough this year as well, as the bottom two teams in the Super League are relegated to the Jia League, and before the match on the day of this interview, Shenhua was only 1 point from the bottom of the table.  Nicolas Anelka seemed to have motivational problems playing for Shenhua as well, only scoring 2 goals this year, and stirring speculation that he would leave the club when French manager Jean Tigana was sacked.

It was much better on the day of this interview, as even though Anelka didn't play, Shenhua seemed to be a totally different team, beating heated rivals Beijing Guoan 3-1, giving hope that maybe this team will do better in the near future.  They still will have a long way to go to even come close to challenging Guangzhou Hengda though, who are the Manchester City of the Super League as they just have a ton of money to spend.

Others claim that the Etra Prime Incident began the escalation of events. But whatever the cause – and its almost certain that the full story has yet to be uncovered – the terrible War began. The Time Lords reached back into their own history, to assemble a fleet of Bowships, Black Hole Carriers and N-Forms; the Daleks unleashed the full might of the Deathsmiths of Goth, and launched an awesome fleet into the Vortex, led by the Emperor himself.""

You need to get that started ASAP.

As for late applications; I think your best bet is probably to try applying directly for a course. University courses this year might be slightly empty due to the fee changes, so you might be able to bypass UCAS and their charge for handling your application (When I did my UCAS application, it cost £10. It might be more now.)

As for a ""history-based"" course, what sort of History are you specifically looking for? I completed a History degree at Huddersfield and I enjoyed it there. There's various ranking tables based on UCAS tarriffs and whatnot, but History really depends on what topic you want to specialise in and if you've studied the subject before at all.

In fact a friend fought tooth and nail to get me an internship and couldn't. He told me the only way I'd get into it at this point is if somebody in the industry died. Another friend graduated from the same degree and refused to do anything else, so he's been sat on the heap since then. 

Back to Web Design though, after picking up the basics I've been in fulltime work with a lot of freelance on the side since then and I can massively recommend it. Learning the basics and then pitching for jobs using animation as your angle will put you in very good stead, especially considering how prevalent Flash banner ads are yet the people with Flash skills are getting harder to find, plus the fact that animation is starting to play a bigger part in modern web design.

&gt; * On census night the population in England and Wales was 56.1 million, 53.0 million in England and 3.1 million in Wales. This was the largest the population had ever been.

&gt; * The population of England and Wales grew by 3.7 million in the 10 years since the last census, rising from 52.4 million in 2001, an increase of 7.1 per cent. This was the largest growth in the population in England and Wales in any 10-year period since census taking began, in 1801.

&gt; * The median age of the population in England and Wales was 39. For men, the median age was 38 and for women it was 40. In 1911, the median age was 25. 
The percentage of the population aged 65 and over was the highest seen in any census at 16.4 per cent, that is one in six people in the population was 65 and over.

&gt; * There were 430,000 residents aged 90 and over in 2011 compared with 340,000 in 2001 and 13,000 in 1911.
In 2011, there were 3.5 million children under five in England and Wales, 406,000 more than in 2001.

Basically; more old people now than ever both as a fraction and in real terms. Which explains the lack of ideas, the overall negativity/bad moods and the increasing smell of urine we've *all* noticed on the buses in the last 10 years....

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"Too many central midfielders? I disagree.

Current CMs: Essien, Romeu, Ramires, Lampard, Mikel, Malouda, Meireles, McEachran.

Ramires seems to be primarily used as a right winger, especially given our lack of natural right sided talent. McEachran is too young and inexperienced to make a lasting impression on the first team this season. I'm willing to bet that de Bruyne would not be moved to CM in his first season.

Chelsea typically play two deep CMs, each with a different set of tasks, the defensive midfielder, and the central mid, who is in charge of link up play between the midfield and forwards, acts as a playmaker but also supports the defensive midfielder when defending.

Our DMs are Mikel and Romeu.

Our CMs are Lampard, Meireles.

Malouda showed last year that he's a shadow of his former self and doesn't really fit into the side anymore, at any position.

Essien is in a precarious position. He hasn't looked himself since returning from his latest injury, and given the severity and frequency of his injuries, his time at the top level may be drawing to a close.

Meireles is a jack of all trades midfielder. He can do a lot of things competently, but not a lot expertly. A squad player, nothing more.

Lampard is quality but also aging and unlikely to be able to handle the stress of an entire season.

Do we have too many CMs? No. Do we have too few *quality* CMs? Yes. Does Oscar solve our needs for this? Not exactly. People claim he can drop deep without a problem but buying a player with no EPL experience and asking him to play out of position, and in an area that's highly physical (the Brazilian league is very much not) is a gamble, to say the least.",0,1342541127,null,0,1342544812,0,c5fa80o,t3_wpf89,t1_c5fa80o,t3_wpf89,null,1429398305,18,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,18

That's a very good way of putting it and the LIBOR scandal is just symptomatic of a wider problem: We have been told for years that this stuff is too important to leave to governments and that the only way to run an economy is to simply let the market figure everything out. That's a very elegant and seductive idea but the evidence of the last 30 years suggests that it is fatally flawed. Why? Because the basic component of a market is the participants and the participants are human. Regular, venal and irrational humans. 

The crash of 2008 made it patently clear that this perfect system was actually just a cheaters manifesto but nothing really changed since then and this is because no-one, neither from left nor right have been able to articulate an alternative that is both feasible and palatable. Until that happens these scandals will keep coming to light until outrage gets to such a pitch that the financial system as we know it cannot function anymore.

true,The_OncomingStorm,smith,Smith,"I've noticed that in some scenes, the Doctor actually uses a surprising amount of violence, but through careful writing/screenplay we still get the impression that he's not a 'fighter' and always takes the defensive. *But*, he still gets pretty violent and aggresive sometimes. I've been watching through the David Tennent series, and noticed a sortof pattern of his - he'll be all defensive-laid-back-save-the-world-guy, and then something will make him *mad* (usually, yet another needless death), and then he'll be all dark-burning-agressive-hero-save-the-world-kill-all-the-bad-guys man. I think part of the mysteriousness of the Doctor is that on the one hand he seems utterly weak and defenseless physically, but on the other hand, when he has to, he seems to have super-human strength and stamina.
Of course, violence generally causes harm or death, which the Doctor isn't fond of. After all, he's a *Doctor*.

* Your CV needs to look good, and I mean **good**. We get hundreds, and most get binned straight away. Get a very literate and smart friend to look at that shit for you, and try really hard to avoid the standard crap that everyone puts. ""I have great communication skills"" means literally nothing on a CV.

* You are the best advert for getting a job. Go into the store and talk to a member of management. Have a chat (not too long, they are busy) and show them what a great communicator you are. Don't try to impress them - just have a good conversation.

* If you get an interview, bone up beforehand. Know more about the company than they do. This will automatically put you in the top 10%.

* Bear in mind that, while being one of the most populous and easiest jobs to get in the UK, retail is not for everyone. You have to be hardworking, unflappable and outgoing to do well.

If there anything else I think up I'll add it later.

Edit: One more thing - try to be smart about your look. You can probably get away with the rainbow mohawk at the indie game store.

true,whitefalconiv,smith,Smith,"I'd recommend watching some of the classic episodes for story ideas.  Some of them were quite epic, depending on what direction you want to take the campaign in.  The first few doctors didn't know everything and, while clever, didn't know everything, and sometimes the companions saved him, plus the third doctor got to spend a lot of time stranded on Earth, both of which are significant deviations from the recent incarnations.

You need to watch Blink.  The angels are honestly the scariest monsters the doctor faces.  You also need to watch Eccleston's season (he's the 9th doctor, only had 1 season, but had some very memorable episodes, including The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, my favorite episode of the new series, and a potentially terrifying enemy)

Daleks are always going to be a recurring foe, but don't limit yourself to the descriptions in the book (which I admittedly haven't read yet, although I would love to get a DW campaing going).  Daleks have evolved with the show (in their first appearance, they couldn't operate if they weren't in contact with a static charged metal floor, now they can levitate/fly and travel through time, perhaps better than the time lords can).  For a long time, stairs/elevation changes were a good foil for the Daleks, get your players used to that, then throw in flying Daleks.

Also, feel free to post on /r/rpg, the people there might not be familiar with the system, but I'd imagine a good number are familiar with the setting.

Of course there are going to be a few people in America who would take down a UK flag because they hate the UK.  Similarly, there are also a few people in the US who dip their pizza in mayonnaise.  That does not mean I'm not justified in saying ""Americans do not dip their pizza in mayonnaise.""  Why?  Because I understand my culture, and I realize that this is really not common enough to say it's part of the culture.  It isn't.  It is part of the culture to dip french fries in ketchup though.

&gt; I'm not doubting that you've described your personal experience honestly but are you also trying to say that, because you never experienced it, xenophobia isn't actually problem in some areas?

I didn't say that xenophobia isn't a problem.  Didn't you read the last sentence of my comment?  Of course xenophobia is a major part of American culture.  I'm not discussing xenophobia.  I'm discussing hatred of the British.  The amount of people who hate the UK so much they'd rip down some stranger's flag.

&gt; I'm not doubting that you've described your personal experience honestly but are you also trying to say that, because you never experienced it, xenophobia isn't actually problem in some areas?

This is like saying that the only way to be sure that Americans really do dip their fries in ketchup is to set up a nation-wide experiment. (Note: you really don't need to test the entire population to have more than enough certainty about something.  You really only need a few dozen randomly selected people in order to pass the standard alpha test of 95%). I don't need to do that experiment, because my experiences-- interpersonal and seeing people do it on tv, talk about it on radio, talk about it on the internet, etc--convince me that it's just obviously true.  It's more than just my personal experiences.

I have never met anyone personally, met anyone else who met anyone else personally, heard about on tv, saw references in a show, lyrics in a song, words in a book, etc, of an American who really hated the UK.  So it's not even in question.  It's not like France or anything.

&gt;Besides there is a minor historical precedent for tearing down Union flags that I'm sure some Patriots would enjoy re-enacting. 

...why the hell did you think this would be a point in your favor?  That's the Revolutionary War.  When we were fighting against the English.  Hundreds of years ago.  So long ago that it has absolutely no bearing on how Americans feel about the British today.  That's like saying that since the Romans fought so long with Germans, that Italians still hate Germans to this day.  Uhh, no.

&gt;that I'm sure some Patriots would enjoy re-enacting. 

If they do, it's only for the love of re-enacting, and not out of any real modern-day hatred for the English.  Same with civil war re-enactments.

The silence should be sacrificed if targeted (common for an illusion), since it's way overpowered (a 1/1 unblockable for 2 is considered annoying enough).

Something Blue should cost a lot more.  Blue is already overpowered with combos. 

Automated sickbay's first ability seems a bit too unfun.

Torchwood is more powerful than cards already banned in most formats.  It needs some mana costs associated with its abilities.

Star Whale is too exploitable considering players could easily use blanket land destruction spells to win the game, regardless of color.  It may work better as a creature.

Martian Water is off-color, and way too powerful for its cost.  

Heroic ambition is interesting, but it could be abused with the right cards.  It should probably cost more.

River's Journal - Again, tutoring (searching for cards in your deck) is very powerful, and usually costs at least 4 or 5 mana.  Same with Agatha Christie and Wilfred Mott and Psychic Paper.

With Ood, you could give them an ability that allows you to put any number of them in your deck to make Ood Sigma stronger.

Torajii Sun - This is more powerful than black lotus, which is currently the most expensive card in the game, often going into the 1000s and 10,000s of dollars.  Maybe this would work as an expensive artifact, but not a land.

Lazarus should be legendary

Dalek/Human hybrid can cost less for what it's body and abilities are.  In fact, it should be much stronger, since there are 1-cost creatures with similar abilities and same body.

Cybermat is a bit strong considering it has no color, which means it can only be blocked by artifact creatures, which many decks don't have.

Jagrafess needs to cost a bit more, and can also probably have more power/toughness.

World's End is off-color.  It would work better as a black and/or red card.

Bad Wolf is a bit powerful since it is pretty versatile.

Weeping Angel could use a different ability, since first strike, flying, deathtouch aren't all that useful unless you found a way to tap all enemy creatures, which is usually only possible with blue or white.

true,Aspel,silence,Silence,"UGH, I want to just go through and tear into the bad design space of these. Even more so because they're *Doctor Who* cards. But I'm too lazy.

That said, 

* Order of the Headless are too strong, 3/3 is the upper limit for human sized creatures. 

* Jenny and Vastra don't really need to be Red/Green, and would probably be better off Black/White (heroic, but also dangerous and bloodthirsty. Red/White might also work). Also maybe use the same archetype and templating that the [Duo](http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Aduo&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) cards have, maybe with Creature and Artifact cards instead. Their abilities, P/T, and cost are also all way too much, and would put them at incredibly broken Mythic level. They're almost better than Thrun. 2/2, Doublestrike when you play an Equipment spell, Lifelink when you play a Creature spell. 2WB, rare

* Tesselector should be an artifact creature. {3}, Artifact Creature - Shapeshifter Construct, 1/1 ""{2}, {T}: Tesselecta becomes a copy of another creature on the battlefield and gains this ability.""

* 1B unblockable 3/1 is broken. Latch Seeker is a 3/1 unblockable at 1UU. Go 1BB, can't block and is unblockable. Also, ""~ is unblockable"", not ""unblockable"". Unblockable isn't templated like that. I'd also suggest something more fitting for The Silent. Maybe 2B Creature - Advisor Alien, 2/2, Hexproof, 2BB: Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. Make it Mythic, too.

* The Flesh occupies the same design space as the Tesselecta. I'd suggest something more akin to Cackling Counterpart. Perhaps {4} with ""{3}, {T}: Put a Token into play that's a copy of target creature, except that it's an artifact in addition to it's other types. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.""

* Stormaggedon is just silly. So I won't judge it.

* Something Blue is a single colour Diabolic Tutor at Uncommon for 1 less. 1B, ""search your library for blue card, reveal it, then shuffle your library and put that card on top.""

* Sexy: Too high cost, especially for a Mythic. Make her 4. W: target creature gets protection from the colour of your choice until end of turn; U: Counter target spell that targets a player or permanent; B: Target creature gets -X/-X where X is the number of artifacts you control; 1R: Target creature gets Haste and First Strike until end of turn; G: Target creature gets +2/+2 and Trample until end of turn.

* Automated Sickbay. Nice fluff and design space. Turn the CMC down to 3. Kind of a junk rare, though. Any deck that would play this would want pingers, but any deck that has pingers is generally going to be red and not want to waste time with this. Better would be giving you and creatures you control Hexproof, and remove creatures that are damaged from the game until end of turn, which would be about 5CMC (basing it off Asceticism, changing out the Regenerate)

* For Van Gogh, Shroud no longer exists, or at least, new cards won't be printed with it. Much like Fear, it's been replaced. Hexproof, All permanents are all colours. 

* Call it Torchwood 2, and I'm not sure saccing their base is good fluff. Either way, if you sac a land to tutor an artifact, make sure to reveal it, give the sac a cost, and make the artifact tutored be of a certain CMC. I'd say {2}, {T}, Sacrifice ~: search and reveal an artifact CMC 3 or less.

* There's no reason for the Dream Lord to be colourless. If anything he should be Black/Blue. Shroud is outdated, and his abilities make no thematic sense. 

* I don't know if I like any of the design of the Supreme Dalek. Why bring back Infect? Use core set keywords, or make up new ones. Don't throw around keywords willy nilly. And why a Mutant? Yes, Daleks are Mutants, but does it make sense for it to be a Mutant Lord? Dalek should be it's own Creature Type. And if you are bringing back keywords, then Living Weapon might be more appropriate for them.

* Smiler could be CMC2, or even 1. 

* At least give the Silurians some flavourtext. I hate vanilla creatures, but this one is basically just a green Elite Vanguard.

* Make the Saturnynian a Merfolk. Make it 3/2 at least, and... maybe give it a better ability. Or not. 

* Star Whale should be Mythic.

* Make Rassilon smaller. Specific tutors are also outdated, the only one in recent years I can think of is Nissa's Chosen. His ability is also lackluster. I'd say make him 1WR, Mythic, Legendary Creature - Timelord Lord, Doublestrike, 3/3. When Rassilon attacks, tap target creature {T}: Destroy target creature; If you're intent on him being RB, then have him destroy target creature when attacking, and {T}: Choose a creature target player controls. That player sacrifices that creature; Fits his super glove.

* Nonland permanents would be better. A similar ability is Planar Cleansing, which is 3WWW. Should also *not* be an Instant, at least not at that cost.

* Likewise, maybe restrict it to ""this turn"". Also, specify permanent cards.

* At the beginning of their upkeep, each player chooses a permanent at random and removes it from the game. When Crack in the Wall is exiled, return all cards exiled by it to play.

* I don't like any of the design space of Amy. She's stronger than Rafiq of the Many at 4/2, and with her abilities she becomes a 10/8. That's ridiculous. Likewise, that tutoring is badly templated, and tutoring for specific cards is an archaic mechanic. This isn't Scion of Darkness. Also, Legendary Creature - Human Companion.

* Make Tritovore 2W, Insect Soldier, 2/2, {T}, Sac: return artifact. Although I'm not sure if White fits. Blue might be better.

* The Doctor's Hand is a reprint of Mirror Gallery, which is CMC 5

* Midnight might be better served as Coming into play tapped unless you sac a creature.

* With Mickey you're again basing cards around other specific cards. Yes, this is flavorfulish for *Doctor Who*, but not for Magic. Also, why green? Seems more Red or Blue. Other than the ability you gave him (which is Red or White anyway)

* Blue doesn't do ""Destroy Target Creature"" and especially not at CMC better than Murder. The Martian Water didn't even destroy anything.

* Heroic Ambition is at once stupid, and yet... kind of cool. Not sure what you'd do with it, though. And it would need some clearing up, since you'd obviously need an End of Turn. Maybe pay mana and put out a few creatures so that your Upkeep triggers work better? I actually really like that idea, though I'm not sure if it fits with Jackson Lake.

* Seriously, first off, Legendary Creature - Human Timelord. Also, Mythic. CMC is fine, G: Regenerate target Creature; 1W: Exile target creature, put a -1/-1 counter on DoctorDonna (one word, CamelCase). I... actually think with that in mind, her Toughness is fine, though maybe 3 would be better. Also, 1U: Destroy target artifact.

* Don't like the Vashte Narada, and it's templating is bad.

* Don't bring back Battlecry. Go like the M13 wolf. For each other Sontaran, +1/+1

* River's Journal. 2U, reveal it before you put it in your hand.

* Jenny. Legendary Creature - Timelord.

* Data ghost is cool. Similar to an existing card I can't think of, but the exile is at the end step and you're bringing the creature itself back to play.

* Agatha Christie would be a creature, not an Instant. And that's not remotely Green.

* Same with Wilf. Those two don't even feel like their characters.

* Pyrovile is kinda cool. Make it an Elemental Soldier. Also, give it the same RRR cost as Ball Lightning. I'd also have you exile it at the next end step.

* Don't know if I'd go with Ood as a basic 1/1 weenie. Blue doesn't usually have 1/1 vanillas. In fact, it has none. Give it a {T}: Draw, at least. There's about a hundred blue cards that do that.

* Don't give Max fear. Fear is outdated, use Intimidate. Also, draw two cards when he goes to the graveyard. And he should really be a Legendary. In fact, why card draw? Why sacrifice? Sacrifice another creature and get cards equal to it's toughness. Blargh.

We only have four players who can play as the striker. Torres, Lukaku, Sturridge and Piazon (who prefers AM and CF). Out of these four only two can be considered full on strikers who are Lukaku and Torres. Sturridge wants to be the main man like he has said many times in the past but he is better as playing just behind the target man. This means that Lukaku will definitely get many starts in the league, perhaps even besides Torres. Then there is the league cup, F.A and all that. Really don't see the reason why we should loan our only other back up considering the club is going to keep their word and not sign another big name striker besides Torres. 

If Lukaku goes on loan then we need Hulk or we might be screwed upfront with risking everything on just one main striker. You cannot rely on just one main striker in the full squad no matter who you are.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"&gt; if someones history is complex can you blame a doctor for missing one thing that may be underlying when others are more evident? 

Of course it's difficult, but doctors being the clinicians will clearly get the blame when someone dies. The public don't know what it's like, but when the news calls it 'basic' errors it makes it seem like people are just incompetent. No-one is perfect, and in a country with £50m with a national health service there are going to be deaths, but sadly that's no consolation when it's your partner or relative that's died.

That said, I read an article in an MPS newsletter (a medico-legal publication for doctors) where it presented a case with a junior hospital doc who was sued for negligence because he misdiagnosed a patient resulting in disease which affected the patients ability to have children. Because the diagnosis was not a common one, the MPS felt that doctors can be rather quick to dismiss something which is unlikely, but nevertheless possible, simply because they don't encounter it that much. So when there's a complex case you may miss something quite critical when there's so much info being thrown at you and you're looking at the most predictable things.

&gt; In my department we lost 2 nurses in the past year and neither will be replaced

I don't get this either. This happened in our hospital, only with a doctor. After a consultant left he was supposed to be replaced, but the trust never authorised hiring a replacement for them, so there was no substantive consultant in place. This meant locums were frequently required, and because they generally don't have much experience at our hospital there's the issue with the 'settling in' factor that causes delays.

The cuts have undoubtably put pressure on management, but the issue is they rarely have clinical experience so they have no idea what a setback things like this can do. And they only listen to other management types, if you're a clinician they ignore you because you 'don't know how to run things'.

It's going to be hard to fill Luka's boots in that exact role, but THudd can do some of it while providing a more physical presence in midfield.  Also, Jake Livermore's passing was exquisite whenever he got a game last year.

If we sell Luka, I'm not convinced we need to try to improve in that position a whole lot more than we've got.  I'd be excited for Moutinho, and he might be the only player we could reasonably get that could do what Luka does, but I'd much rather spend the money on a player like Falcao, if those rumors have anything to them.

That way it gives everyone at least a week (or more) to view the episode via DVR, etc.  Does that make sense?

That's absolutely what it means.  America being one of most diverse single nations on Earth cannot be generalised by the personal anecdote of a single human being.  It's too little to describe too much, it loses meaning.

I certainly wouldn't say that Brits would never tear down a flag, or that Britain is not xenophobic or racist despite me having such lovely neighbours and wonderful friends.  It would be foolish of me to generalise so (and would be more than a little insulting to the Asian community).  I'm making an entirely semantic argument.

&gt;Because I understand my culture, and I realize that this is really not common enough to say it's part of the culture.

You understand what you've experienced.  Not doubting you there.  Is what you've experienced enough to generalise to 300 million people living in 50 different states? Probably not.

&gt;The amount of people who hate the UK so much they'd rip down some stranger's flag.

In this case, hate remains to be established a motive (and I certainly never might to imply it would be the sole reason someone would tear down a flag).  It was probably drunks having a laugh.  Would it be impossible to imagine this scenario in the US?

&gt;This is like saying that the only way to be sure that Americans really do dip their fries in ketchup is to set up a nation-wide experiment.

That's exactly what it's saying.  Fortunately fastfood companies are good at keeping track of data like this and adjust their services to best match demand which in this case probably favours ketchup.

&gt;tv, talk about it on radio, talk about it on the internet, etc--convince me that it's just obviously true

A million marketing executives just smiled.

&gt;..why the hell did you think this would be a point in your favor? That's the Revolutionary War. When we were fighting against the English. Hundreds of years ago.

Nationalism/Patriotism can motivate people to do crazy things.  The English can display some pretty hateful behaviour towards the Germans for the same reason as you've pointed out.  Same for hundreds of other cultures across the Earth.

&gt;So long ago that it has absolutely no bearing on how Americans feel about the British today.

I keep forgetting that 200 years is about two-thirds of American history thus making it seem like a disproportionally long time ago when compared to, say, European history.

&gt;Italians still hate Germans to this day.

They do but for other reasons (though hate is a strong word).  The lazy Italian is a popular German stereotype and usually the butt of a few jokes (like the Scotsman to the English, or the Irishman to the Scots etc).  God help you if you start waving a Dutch flag in Germany though...

I think the midfield from the OP would get run over, especially on the road.  It's going to be hard to play Lennon, VDV, and Gylfi in the same lineup.  So I'm going to present the revolutionary idea that we try something like ""squad rotation"".  Lennon probably won't like being a sub, but VDV's hamstrings will ensure him enough starts and I think he would be deadly coming on late in that lineup.

EDIT: I want to further add that VDV at RS is a perfect fit for Walker at RB.  AVB's preferred system is for the RS to drift inside and width be provided down the right wing from the RB.  Walker's pace and athleticism is a perfect fit.  I think this lineup could be very, very dirty.

Repayments are tied to earnings and taken directly from your salary, the loan also does not appear on your credit file. If you have other lines if credit, you should absolutely pay those off first, and even if you don't, you still gain little to nothing by paying student loans off early.

No-one has been arrested for sexist tweets afaik.

If it is illegal in real life it is illegal on the internet. That is now clearly established in case law.


&gt; How about other insults? 

How about not using the internet to go round insulting and offending people. 

&gt; Arresting people for racism does more harm than good, by arresting them you aren't going to change the way a person thinks, more than likely that person will think ""fucking niggers got me arrested"". Social stigma and eduation is the way.

Or they learn the stupidity of their actions and the limits of speech. If they were racist anyway it may be that nothing much has changed. It may be all their decent minded friends want nothing to do with them any more as they dont want to be seen associating with racists.

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"*tl;dr: yes it is worth contacting them again, you're stuck without funds and the bank needs to fix that ASAP. Sorry for wall of text.*

The front line staff have no authority whatsoever. The guy you talk to when you want to order a statement cannot authorise a single penny's worth of compensation for you. However any organisation regulated by the FSA, banks of course being the most obvious example, must have a well defined complaints handling process. They can receive fines if they don't resolve certain types of complaints promptly.

Now that you have contacted them with your concern it should have been assigned a reference number and a case handler. If you haven't received details of this yet, phone them up (during office hours; just because they provide telephone banking at silly o'clock doesn't mean all the other departments are open in the middle of the night) and explain to the guy that you have an existing complaint and need to speak to the customer care team. Don't ask to speak to a manager in telephone banking, they are almost as powerless as their minions.

Once you have gotten through to someone who has the ability to actually do something, find out what progress they have made with the case. If the answer is ""not much"" stress the urgency of your situation; i.e. that you have no access to funds. If this is a bank error, which is what it sounds like, they should be bending over backwards to fix this. If the overdraft facility has been disabled in error they should simply turn it back on. Even if it's somehow your fault, they should be able to set up that basic account that I mentioned and arrange a payment plan for getting the overdraft paid back.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome you have the right to contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to ask them to arbitrate. They will contact the bank to collect evidence, decide who is right and then write to both parties with a recommendation on what to do. The bank is basically bound by their decision, so if FOS say ""yeah you fucked up, pay this guy £1,000"" then that's what they will do.

It's important to reiterate that the FOS route is only when the bank's complaint process has failed you, so hopefully it won't come to that because it will mean that you have been without funds for several weeks. Oh and if you are expecting any income, e.g. wages, to be paid into that account, contact the payer and ask them to suspend payment until further notice because you don't want it getting swallowed up by the overdraft. Ask if they will send a cheque that you can hold on to until it's safe to pay it in.",0,1342563895,null,0,false,0,c5fgtxo,t3_wpbxc,t1_c5fgtxo,t1_c5fbgyp,null,1429401496,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

\* Yes, I am aware those are all reports on C2C's website, before anyone mentions it.

Again Virgin have a new fleet of trains and one of the most heavily upgraded lines in the country, yet their punctuality is about 85% regularly, some of that is obviously outside of their control though, eg recent disruption because of a suicide.

Merseyrail is closest franchise to me really but is crying out for new trains, a C2C style transformation would be nice but probably unlikely at the moment...

Agree with you that it's a risk doing the longer term franchise awards, but it has been shown to work. Better that than the operator changing every few years.

Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side.

I find when a fanbase has to think up of a reasonable way for two things to connect instead of writing a clear cut connection into the show, you hurt your product. Moffat does this a lot but people overlook it because he toploads his episodes with catchphrases and flashy dramantics to distract people from noticing them.

But for the sake of answering your question I believe the only logical conclusion is that Ten and Martha viewed it from inside the Tardis which could have: 1. Filtered out the Silence message as the Tardis knows all of time and space's history and takes The Doctor to where he has to be in order for time to be correct. So it knew if they saw it it could create a paradox. 2. If we believe they are outside of the Tardis then my only reasonable answer is that The Doctor did see it but being of such a higher state of mind only took note of it and kept it in mind for when as Eleven he had to create the message himself. Similar to how Doctors can simply ""sense"" events or memories of other Doctors.

He used his devices to build on previous developments which is the reason why David Tennant's run on Doctor Who was so successful and loved. Every Series improved on the last and never relied on the same tired writing cliches to write themselves out of a corner.

Moffat? He's used the ""universe threatens to be erased so let's reboot it!"" twice in a row as his ""big Series ending moment"". He's also continued to do nothing but re-use the same catchphrases while substituting one word in them to fool people into thinking it's ""character development because they went from liking X to liking Y!"" While Tennant's (and even Eccleston's) were constantly used, they were always in context logical to the story (I.E. saying ""Allons-y!"" when it was time to leave an area or having to move immediately.) Smith has none of that and is only given the same line but changed up every few episodes because none of them would be able to stick permanently on their own. Smith's ""catchphrases"" were designed for marketing. Tennant/Eccleston's were designed as character quirks.

That is my problem with Moffat. He's unoriginal but people can't seem to see past the shiny surface because they've been duped into thinking what they're watching from Series 6 onward is well written TV. It's not. Actually look at what's presented to you and you'll see about only 10% of the time does the conclusion actually make any logical sense, and 9 out of 10 of that % is from other writer's who wrote the episode.

He's currently gone through 11 regeneration(he didn't have to regenerate for his first incarnation) and has 12 regeneration in total. So, in theory, he'll die permanently after he dies in his 13th incarnation. Obviously, though, the show will find some way around this. 

Small tidbit, The Doctor has no real idea how old he is, most likely due to a combination of not keeping track while time travelling and just plain out losing track from being so darned old. This has been hinted at several times through the classic series, explicitly stated by the 8th Doctor, and mentioned by Moffat himself.

true,Chive,canada,Norn Irn-&gt;Yorkshire-&gt;Essex-&gt;Alberta,"Frankly yes I think it is getting ridiculous. I don't give a flying fuck about what people say on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook or- for the record- reddit. If someone's saying something that I find offensive then I think the best course of action is usually to close the tab and ignore them. Different matter if they're trying to incite violence or stalking/harassing someone but that's a different offence.

The problem comes partly from the UK not having a codified constitution setting out the rights of its citizens. The situation is basically that something is allowed unless it has been specifically banned, however successive governments have merrily chipped away at *our freedoms* to the extent that the situation is now ridiculous.

The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Section 4A states:  
&gt;(1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress, he— (a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress.

This is where the self-entitlement about not being offended was put into law and from where the present problems arise. It's not just an offence to incite hatred- which is understandable- but also an offence to intend to cause distress. Quite how intent would be proven is another matter, although in many cases the language used is pretty self-evident. 

When the legislation was passed in 1994 by John Major's administration internet use was nowhere near the levels it is now and sites like Twitter, Facebook etc would have been unimaginable. This law wasn't originally designed to police online social networking but is now being used in that context.

I know there's stuff that happens off screen and time gaps but you'd think if you were crazy old there would be HUGE gaps in regenerations, like hundreds of years. So assuming he's a 1000 years old give or take, he's kinda blowing through them a little fast and you are also left wondering what was he doing before this that he never used up a life until the show started and he was already in his current lifestyles, just lucky i guess.

2.  For the most part, I agree.  I'm leaning toward ""current + last"", or if we're ""between series"", the last 2.  (For instance, right now it would be 5 + 6 = spoilers, 1-4, not.  Once series 7 starts, it would be 6+7.)  It's pretty reasonable that anyone hanging out in here should have seen up to the last two series before they start to participate too much.  You don't go to ""Star Wars Celebration"" without knowing that Vader is Luke's father.

    On the other hand, there are *plenty* of new fans who come here as a way to express their ecstasy at finding something they really love.  There's no 100% correct answer, just one that fits us best.

3.  The ""S00E00"" format was suggested by people in the past, so I raised it for discussion to see what people thought of it.  I think it's a bit overboard, personally.

4.  It's not really that hard.  People report links with spoilers - they already do it, but I'd be able to remove more of them than I do now.  Like it or not, I use the 48 hour rule for all judgements currently.

Modric played as the the CM creative playmaker alongside usually either Parker or Sandro on defensive-holding duty.

Martha and the Doctor went  to the moon landing back when they had the Tardis:

&gt;Martha Jones: Oh, the moon landing's brilliant. We went four times. **Back when we had transport... **

&gt;The Doctor: Working on it! 

So why on earth would you watch something on TV when you had the Tardis that could take you there. 

Secondly, the way that Time works, is that it's always influx unless it's a fixed point. So the Master in the old series didn't have the sound of drums in his head, until Rassilion went back and put them in his head, which is why he doesn't have them in the old series. Just like Jack didn't exist in the past until he went into the past (Wibby Wobbly is hard to explain if you look at it in a linear fashion)

By rejecting 40m for him last year from Chelsea, it's pretty obvious to everyone that we're not going to be selling under 30. United no longer have the finances to pay that kind of money, Chelsea know we're not selling to them for anything less than stupid money, Barcelona don't have a need for him, and neither do City, there's not a chance in hell he goes to Anzhi or Asia. That pretty much just leaves Real Madrid and PSG as candidates, and all signs indicate that talks with Madrid have been ongoing. As for Modders himself, it's a tired argument, but assists and goals don't tell the entire story. He's not there to create goalscoring opportunities, we had Bale, Lennon, Rafa and Ade for that last season. He was the heart of the midfield and was the one to make the smart passes and keep possession, he dictated the tempo of the game. Obviously he's not quite on the same level, but it's similar to how Xavi plays. He doesn't get many goals or assists but no one will deny that he's a world-class midfielder. Modric isn't quite as good, but his effect on the game is subtle, and we're going to have a hell of a job replacing him, imo.",0,1342577526,null,0,false,0,c5fk6oz,t3_wqg5f,t1_c5fk6oz,t1_c5fjy2a,null,1429403178,13,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,13

As far as Scotland goes - you can't go wrong with Edinburgh, it's full of tourists this time of year but there's masses of history here that make up for that. Loads to look at and see. 

From Edinburgh head west to Glasgow (if you're in a car this should take no longer than 3 hours at the very most if you're driving slowly). Glasgow is historically a ""dirty"" city. Loads of manufacturing, ship yards and factories were the norm a hundred years ago. In the last 20 years the city council has thrown money at the place so now it's tidy and respectable. Glasgow to me doesn't have the same ""old"" feel to it that Edinburgh does - it feels distinctly more modern, the streets are laid out in grids for example. . . I was born here and think it's amazing! 

From Glasgow head north and west if you can into the highlands. You'll hit a town called ""Balloch"" on Loch Lomond (Loch is lake ;) there's not a whole lot in Balloch but the loch is pretty. Dive north past Loch Lomond head towards Glencoe where the mountains are - stay at the Clachaig Inn. The whole area is typical Scotland scenery you see in movies.

Furthermore, how many excuses can you make for a player?  Yes, he completes a lot of passes. So does Ryan Shawcross. Does this mean RC is comparable to Xavi?  Obviously not. Xavi has two things going for him that modric doesn't. 1.  He creates goals. 2. He scores goals. 

Plus Xavi actually dictates play from an advanced position. Most barca moves start or end with him. Modric does nothing but recycle possession and he doesn't even do that as well as Parker or Sandro. 

Finally, I'm sick of modric lovers saying he doesn't get assists because the team is set up to play along the wings but in the same breath they will complain that modders can't get assists because teams park the bus and close down space. If teams really parked the bus against spurs that would benefit a player of modders alleged skill. Yet the stats clearly show that it's the wingers getting most of the assists. Curious.

Central Attacking Midfield (Brazil U20), Central Midfield (Internacional).

There's no direct certainty that RDM will play a standard 4-2-3-1 variation 100% of the time. My best guess, and you guys can draw your own conclusions from reading over the stats, is that he'll cover for right midfield if needed, or can fill in the AMC role if a squad rotation is needed.

I don't think he's defensively responsible enough to play Lampard's more withdrawn role as we've seen him in this past season, but that's not to say he's not capable of doing so in the future.
