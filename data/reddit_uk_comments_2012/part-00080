true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"Indeed - but to the child (and the family of the child), that extra year or so is the rest of his life. You could call that emotion, but it's still fact.

Sure, the money could be put to better use - but so could the money I spent on a Core I7, or people spend on iPads (and so on). We're not talking about diverting NHS funds here (which would be a different kettle of fish) - more a case of 'would you donate a fiver' (or whatever). I'm quite happy for people to spend that fiver on this child over circlejerking about the £400 iPad they just bought and didn't need - you don't see many posts complaining about this sort of thing in *those* threads.

Ultimately, It's easy to rationalise your way out of donating to *anything* on reddit - look at the fuss over the bra-thing, for example; a success, raised lots of money for breast cancer research, but plenty of people of reddit were much more keen on spending as much (if not more) effort on dismissing the entire idea; something that actually *increased* once it was known to be a success, and it left a bad taste in my mouth seeing just how much effort some people will put into trying to belittle something (when they've been proved to be wrong) instead of actually doing some good themselves. Now, would the money going to this child be better spent on breast cancer research? Probably - but that's not the point of the OP and, since it's not very hard to figure out, it's about as insensitive as you can get to say so, really. I generally don't post stuff I wouldn't say outright to people in real life, and so it's depressing that so many still seem to think that there's nothing wrong with doing so.

As a result, when an appeal for a single child appears, then it's ultimately quite cowardly (and, to my mind, nasty) to post dismissive, alternative uses for the money under the apparent assumption that discouraging others from donating is somehow the nicest thing to do when the OP (and anyone that donates) is probably quite aware of how much money is involved. And that's before we get to the issue of defining a 'ridiculous amount of money' - I'm not sure JakeSteam realises how much cost is involved providing lifetime care-in-the-home and other services to quadraplegics, and others that are incapacitiated (many of which could also be presented as a waste of money, if that was the goal).

This is the standard derail.  I don't even rise to it now.  Either people will challenge you for being conspiratorial - as if a conspiracy is even necessary when you have a common class interest, and as if they don't ""conspire"" (for want of  better word) in the boardrooms, golf clubs, private members clubs, gated communities, tax havens, exclusive resorts, yacht decks and so on across the world. Or they will seek to embellish and make ridiculous the narrative by unnecessarily bolting on the most ludicrous elements drawn from the kooks, the insane, and the amateur and professional trolls of the world.

&gt;If you actually made a documentary showing the scale of this theft you'd probably be laughed at.

The best attempt so far is undoubtedly [Inside Job](http://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/inside_job_2010/).

The real strength of barce isnt possession, it's actually the closing down. Once they have the ball they will compact the space massively, always have an out and play nice pentagrams for passing options. If they attack and fail they have straight away 2 or more people able to close down players and if they get the ball they counter attack very quickly. If anything I would like to know the % of goals barce scores in this way. Possession is used to tire teams while regaining theirs. It also forces teams that press to come up to press making space for off the ball runs into the space.

Possession like barce play isn't hard, look at Chelsea under avb, second highest possession in Europe. The difficulty is combining it with pressing, pressing to the level barce do it needs to be nearly instinctive. They close down straight away, also you need an outlet like messi to run at players if needed, force defenders to close him.

I caught the tail-end of something about this on Radio4 a few days ago, the presenter talking to a Bomber Command veteran who had spent his life savings creating a memorial at (I think) Beachy Head.  When asked how he felt about the bombing of civilians he said that (paraphrased) it was [Total War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war), they looked on the bombing of civilian workers the same way that they looked on the bombing of munitions and engineering factories, but if you blew the roof off of a factory it would be repaired and back in production within a week.  If you killed a civilian working in the factory however you decreased the amount of production capability.  That sounds really callous to us, but for someone who lived in fear of death on every flight and had seen friends and family die at German hands I guess it's understandable.

Both Hitler and the allies were operating under the concept of Total War. Here's a quote from Churchill:

&gt;There is another more obvious difference from 1914. The whole of the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire population, men, women and children.

I'm not trying to justify Bomber Command's or the aircrew's actions, but it's hard to imagine what the country was going through without having lived through it. Massive bombing of the capital and other major towns and cities, the threat of invasion, the losses at Dunkirk.  I'm sure a lot of us would like to think that if we were a member of a bombers crew ordered to bomb civilian areas we'd stand up and refuse, but that's looking at it through the eyes of some who's not seen friends and family shot down or bombed and doesn't know if they will live to see the next day.

true,crowey,null,null,"(I'm an evolutionary geneticist, homosexuality in all animals is interesting because like you say, it self selects for non breeding, but it does seem to have a genetic component. As ever, if there's a short explanation, the answer is usually ""it's a bit more complicated than that"")

Like your example of eye colour, the genetics of a trait are often more complicated than variations of a single gene. Eye colour is controlled by several genes, each with multiple variants (alleles), that's why there's so many shades of brown, green, hazel, blue, grey etc. There are dominance and co-dominance hierarchies, which can mean someone can have both the blue and brown genes but only has brown eyes (or for a simpler example ABO blood types: A and B are co-dominant over O, so you can have the genes for A and O, but you have the same blood type as someone with two copies of A)
 In addition to that there is epigenetic control of genes, which can mean that even if a particular allele of a gene is present it might be switched off and the other copy (you have 2 copies of every gene, one from each parent) is the one responsible for the expression of a trait (this is different to dominance, but the effect can be the same).

So it's possible (probable?) that it's a combination of multiple genes, dominance/recessive and epigenetics that results in homosexuality, which would explain the spectrum of gay-bi-straight preferences. 

I know there are genes that if you mess them up you can make fruit flies gay. And I'm sure I've seen a paper about gay men having a disproportionately high % with one allele of a gene, compared to straight men. There are lots of examples of a gene that explains x% of a trait but isn't enough on its own. Amongst scientists i don't think theres much argument that its genetic, even if we don't know all the genes yet. Amongst lay people its a bit more contentious because its hard to explain the science! I'll look up the papers later when I'm not on my phone if you want.

The idea was to kill or make homeless as many as possible in order to cripple the war industry, not a decision to target industry that the German's had decided to keep in the cities (for one the technology simply wasn't there... It was not uncommon for the majority of bombs fell miles away from their targets and this was well known at the time). As a strategy it failed and if anything it actually hardened civilian morale and nor did the campaign really dent the German war effort until the targeting of fuel infrastructure from 1944 onwards.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I totally agree that those who make the decision should be called to account and punished if found guilty (unfortunately for the victims we won and there is no rule more watertight than 'history is written by the victor'). You're also right that since 1945, we've been pretty appalling with our double standards and we apply one set of rules for ourselves and one for others. However, WWII is different kettle of fish. This was not a war of choice nor was it one to secure any inherent geopolitical advantage (nor was it a choice for the people who actually did the fighting). It was literally one of survival and that changes the dynamic entirely. As it happens, I do think the bombing campaign was a war crime but I say this with the benefit of historical hindsight. If I had actually lived through those days I think I would have a very different view, especially if I had lost loved ones in the Blitz or other enemy actions. My thought at that point would be 'I want this to end as soon as possible' and if the bombing was presented to me as a way to draw things to a speedy conclusion, I think I would go along with it even in the knowledge that enemy civilians would suffer as a result.

We already have sickle-cell as a simple example; if you have one copy of the sickle-cell anaemia allele, you are resistant to malaria. If you have two copies, you've got sickle-cell disease. The allele for sickle-cell is thus common in places where malaria kills before you breed.

It's quite probable that the genetics of homosexuality are similar - if you get a subset of the genes that make you gay, you are heterosexual with an advantage when it comes to reproduction. It's only people who get the full set who don't pass on their genes to the next generation.

And then you get into more interesting theories - for example, that gay men in prehistory were more involved in their sisters' and mother's child-rearing than their straight counterparts, and while their gene set dies with them, their siblings, nephews and nieces were radically more likely to survive, keeping the gene set for homosexuality alive, but dormant.",0,1340886577,null,0,false,0,c56qi5l,t3_vqh8j,t1_c56qi5l,t1_c56pynt,null,1429249939,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They say this;
&gt;The Salvation Army teaches that sexual acts should take place only in a monogamous heterosexual marriage, believing that this reflects God's intentions for sexual behaviour and provides the best environment for raising children.

Which would suggest they don't think that homosexual consensual sex should occur, but then they do go on to say this;
&gt;For those who do not share Christian beliefs we advocate a state-recognised marriage characterised by mutual loving commitment and shared responsibility within a relationship

Which may or may not be interpreted as supporting gay-marriage, i.e. maybe but only outside of Christian values.

Of course, a statement on their website may not reflect the personal feelings or practice of their members but I'm not sure why nobody has posted a link to it before me... A lot of baseless comments...although I would never donate to them due to their significant religion before action stance.

For instance, there's a Christian charity called Hospices of Hope that provides palliative care for terminally ill children in Romania. As I understand it, people who are beyond medical hope in Romania are often simply sent home to die without any support, and then, there are very high levels of cancers in some areas, because of the lack of environmental protection in the Ceaucescu era.

By all means vet charities for the sort of unacceptable views that the Salvation Army appears to have, but I don't think all non secular charities should be cast in that light, without good cause.

Edit: typos. On reflection, this is a little bit 'won't someone think of the children', but in this case, that is actually what is needed.",0,1340890491,null,0,1340904388,0,c56r4ga,t3_vqh8j,t1_c56r4ga,t1_c56q19k,null,1429250231,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

""Because I'm a filthy pervert and I'd rather you didn't tell my boss"" being an appropriate response, I'd have thought.

The questions are written in an incredibly push-poll style (""Did you know that the 4 main ISPs have..."").

They either want an essay or they've massively limited the possible responses (Question 11: Should we censor everyone, or just some people? - never mind ""How about no-one, eh?"").

BIG EDIT: (sorry, cocked up my first response, having another go now I've filled in the questionnaire completely)

4 out of 9 pages are aimed at getting input from All Powerful Industry (and not you puny insignificant *citizens*)  on how better to:

1. Scare the living crap out of parents,
1. Push more ineffective and inappropriate band-aid solutions to a simple problem[1]
1. Force more  restrictions on *users* without ever impacting *business* needs

Honestly, they couldn't have made the process more biased if they'd replaced the whole survey with that brilliant question ""When did you stop hitting your wife?"", although of course in this case it would have to be ""So when did you stop making your children looking at porn, you pervert?""...

He is as sane as you or I, he is just a sponging layabout. he has had a clean bill of health since he left the institution and probably shouldn't have been comittied in the first place, he brags about it. his mum earns maybe 18-19k PA and doesn't give him any money, other than the occasional ten pounds he steals.

example 2. ""N"" is paying for her own masters, apparently an MA isn't academic enough to recieve government funding. she works as many hours as she can get and trying to find herself a career, her dad earns about the same. she is penny broke. she cant afford shit.

I guess I am sick of seeing people try and get punished and told there is no help, and those who just kick back and do the bare minimum get a free ride that others are paying for.

as to how many families. maybe i am guilty of generalisation, have you spent 5 minutes in a uk high street, the shower of ill disciplined shit that parades about like god himself (metaphorically) owed them something. these deliberately ignorant, rude, foul examples of human beings that maybe only 10% show any chance at redemption.

regardless, this is what I say to ""N"" when she asks why it seems so unfair.

the system is imperfect, people don't get what they deserve. trying to find someone to blame and excusing yourself from fault is not going to do you any favours. when the inevitable state pension collapse comes, you will have a career and will be able to afford retirement.

Big difference. As for the treatment German war criminals, yes there was a double standard but it's worth pointing out that no German aircrews were prosecuted for bombing civilians. Personally I do think there's a very strong warcrimes case against Harris but not the crews. They had one of the highest casualty rates of any allied service, did what the war demanded of them yet have been airbrushed from our common memory. And yes, total war changes everything. This was not a limited conflicted. It was a case of win or perish. I'm for the rules of war but those had been categorically torn up by Hitler from the get-go and although I consider the bombing of Germany to be at best misguided, at worst an attrocity it was still the product of a perverse and dark episode of human history.

Of our four strikers Tevez looks to be the one most likely to leave this summer, and if we replace him with Van Persie, that leaves us with 4 players that will want to be the spearhead of the attack (one of whom already has a reputation for sulking and causing trouble).

Hell why hasn't llorente had a shot, a great player that can hold up the ball, good aerial ability and good touch. Personally I think del bosque is getting carried away with this whole 6 central mid thing. They struggle to create chances and when teams play narrow and deep they can't create either. They then rely to heavily on alba to create width. This is by why he brings on 2 wide players to create width but lack of options in the box really hinders them as well, most teams just go right ahead go as far to the line as you want because then their is nothing in the centre to pass to.

I don't know that it would be a true Fabergas situation since i don't think Granero is quite as skilled as Cesc.

From what i have heard he is one of those guys at Real that people joke about being a future manager of Real because of his work with the youth teams and his studying psychology.  

Khedira is more of a holding mid which we don't need but i think he has more offensive upside so i think he could work well for us.  I think Jose would like to keep all the players at Real and continue by adding a new superstar each season.  I think we could potentially pry Khedira away simply becasue with Alonzo, Lass,  Modric, Ozil, Kaka, Granero, Sahin etc he would just have too many guys fitting into the CM role so realistically i think outside of Ozil Madrid would probably listen to an offer for any of them.....i think they would pay the VAT and shipping for us if we agreed to take Lass",0,1340905872,null,0,false,0,c56v1zb,t3_vqkg9,t1_c56v1zb,t1_c56ug99,null,1429252149,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I honestly think a majority of it comes down to not having an appreciation for the series. Sure, there are exceptions, but most people complaining about Tennant started with, and have only watched, the new Doctor Who. So Tennant has become what they're familiar with, and they don't want to let that go, even though that is what has carried this show on for so long.

I mean, my personal opinion is that the 8th Doctor is the best. He is *my* Doctor. And if anyone has room to complain about how their favorite Doctor should still be in the role, it's an 8th Doctor fan. However, I don't go around posting all the time,""I like Tennant/Smith/whoever...but they're no McGann. I wish he was still in the role!""

As it is, I take what I can with the Big Finish Audio Adventures, and I still watch the new episodes, excited as ever for them. My love for McGann never gets in the way of Smith, because I *love Doctor Who*. They could put Pauly Shore in the role of The Doctor, and I'd still watch the shit out of it. It's an amazing show, and I think Smith more than does the role justice, even more so than Tennant. Of course, again, that's my opinion, and I think we'd all get along more if people would realize what opinions are, and that they're basing their small experience as basis for factual statements. In other words, all people watch is Tennant, then think their opinion that 'Tennant is the best, and perfected the role' as an immutable fact.

I think GCSEs are probably more do-able than old-skool O-levels, but I don't think that is the fault of the students, nor do I think they are in any way deficient in knowledge compared to equivalent students of days of yore. Their critical thinking and wider skills are perhaps more useful than the rote learning of older syllabus.

Also, GCSE is a broad exam, they make foundation-y ones that the highest you can get is a C grade that are a piece of piss, just so those that aren't gifted in a certain core subject aren't left unemployable due to a lack of a basic qualification....

2) Martha Jones.  Actually useful in a practical sense.  Her medical training made her handy to have around, and she was on top of things enough to keep the Doctor afloat when he was still pouting over the loss of Rose.  As a companion, she was actually ""too good"" for the Doctor as he was at that point in time.

3) Donna Noble.  Took the piss out of the Doctor better than anybody before Amy Pond.  Still, was a bit annoying in the beginning, but she showed her worth at points.  Clever enough to keep up, and curious enough to learn.

4) Rose Tyler.  Let's face it, the only thing Rose had going for her was that she was portrayed by Billie Piper, and even that had its limits.  Every companion who followed was more interesting than Rose in every single way.  The thing that made me saddest about the end of series two was the Rose didn't actually die.

Okay, I'm half-kidding about Rose.  I didn't mind her so much until subsequent series featured the Doctor continuing to focus on her.  Even after she was gone, the show was still about her.

But protest marching doesn't work as the ones against Iraq etc. showed.

Violence doesn't always work and is pretty horrific, although if you stick at it you might get to shake hands with the Queen! The summer of burning stuff and nicking trainers didn't exactly usher in a Glorious Revolution either.

Separation (forming breakaway communities like the communes etc. that scatter the world) doesn't seem terribly effective either.

Unionism seemed to work before, but I doubt it'd be as effective now with the unions in the state they are, weaker communities, and a massive army of unemployed people desperate for any work.

That said the pure amount of corruption now is insane, from the banks manipulating the rates, to news editors dictating to politicians, to dodgy privatisations and PFI schemes.. it really would make a banana republic blush (and we're not even a republic) - so perhaps people will finally do something - but the problem is what is the something that is effective?

Concur.  Marching, especially as ordered, is kinda pointless.

&gt;Violence doesn't always work and is pretty horrific, although if you stick at it you might get to shake hands with the Queen! The summer of burning stuff and nicking trainers didn't exactly usher in a Glorious Revolution either.

Personally, not a violent man.  Not naive enough to believe violence is always ineffective or never called for, but I'd prefer to avoid it unless and until it becomes inevitable.  Let's be honest though, capitalism is inherently violent, it kills thousands each and every day that we let it continue, so in a sense it's a cop-out to say all violence is terrible so we have to be passive.

&gt;Separation (forming breakaway communities like the communes etc. that scatter the world) doesn't seem terribly effective either.

For me television in general is brilliant. I can't help but get this giddy feeling when I know I'm about to watch another episode of something completely fantastic like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the X-Files, Pushing Daisies and yes, Doctor Who.
Why Who specifically? It's starts with the writing. The writers take everything seriously, and yet take nothing seriously at all(lost yet?). By this I mean, they craft this world and populate it with people that are at times talking about death and destruction, but within seconds making a joke about that death and destruction. It makes me smile a big goofy grin knowing that the stories they've come up with not only work on a basic level, but can show you so much more when re-watched later on---like reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a kid, then re-reading it at different times in you life--you pick out different things, find new meanings in passages you forgot even existed. I've found that watching even a random, simple episode like The Tenant can be fascinating. It's not an episode that has to do with the crack in Amy's wall, it's not a mythology bursting story, but it says so much about love, about the things we choose to ignore, about friendship and so much more.

'But none of these restrictions is based on convincing proof that passive smoking kills. It is an assertion that owes a great deal to the sanctimonious superstition that there can be no smoke without death. Reputable scientists admit this. On Desert Island Discs in 2001, Sir Richard Doll, the man who proved the incontrovertible causal link between active smoking and lung cancer, said: ""The effect of other people smoking in my presence is so small it doesn't worry me.""

He was right not to fret. One of the largest studies of the health consequences of secondary smoking was published in the British Medical Journal in 2003. It tracked the health of 118,000 Californians over four decades in a rigorous attempt to identify a causal relationship between environmental tobacco smoke (the scientific term for secondary smoke) and premature death. It concluded: ""The results do not support a causal relationship between ETS and tobacco-related mortality.""'

...

'Since then, further evidence has been published by the BMJ. In March 2005 it offered fresh data suggesting that passive smoking may kill 11,000 people a year in the UK. The crucial word is ""may"". If there is a direct causal link between secondary smoking and lung cancer it is so tiny that dedicated campaigners have struggled to identify it. Scotland's Green Party, hardly a promoter of smoking, recently alleged that more Scots are killed by exhaust fumes than by secondary smoke.'

...

'But the best summary of the passive smoking debate was provided by Dr Smith at the time of the 2003 BMJ controversy. He said: ""I found it disturbing that so many people and organisations referred to the flaws in the study without specifying what they were. Indeed, this debate was much more remarkable for its passion than its precision.""

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Modric is also 26 and world class, one of the top 5 players at his position in world football. Bale is 22, still developing, with his whole career ahead of him. If Bale turns around next year and says he wants to leave, just watch the same people gagging on his cock turn against him and call him a piece of shit. Then again, he's British so maybe he'll get absolved. 

How many truly world class players in the prime of their careers stay at a club that isn't challenging for honors or playing in the Champions League? Not many. All these top 5-10 players that stay at one club for 10-15 years have something in common: they win stuff. Giggs, Scholes, Henry, etc etc. 

We are not going to be challenging for the title next year. We aren't going to be paying our players world class wages next year. When our stadium gets built years down the road, that's when I think we'll make that next step. Do you think we should shackle our best player (by a mile) until he's 30?

This is a player who gave 100% every time he was on the pitch, a player who could have been a distraction and forced his move last season (instead he was once again the best deep-lying midfielder in the country) and a player who is entering the most formative years of his career.

A player who just got done proving that he can go toe to toe with the best midfielders in world football. A player who can walk into almost any midfield in Europe. 

He hasn't disrespected the club; he's told a hard truth. He's ambitious, he wants to play for a team that can challenge for the Champions League title. We are not that team, and we won't be for several years. 

I'm reminded of the term ""delusions of grandeur"". Sorry guys, Spurs are not Real Madrid. We are not Man United. We aren't even Chelsea at the moment. **It isn't inherently disrespectful to be realistic.**

If people honestly think that Modric's behavior in trying to engineer a move has been disrespectful, I have to question what other transfer sagas they have followed. Try to put yourself in his shoes, without letting your passion for the club get in the way. 

It's fucking embarrassing and pathetic that this guy is going to get abused by our fans if he comes back and plays against us. Shit, I think it's pathetic how much abuse Nasri gets from people, and he was much more of a cunt about moving than Luka has been. 

Just a delusional joke of a thread, downvote away. He's not going to achieve to his ambition with us, and we can reach ours without him. Time to move on...it doesn't always have to be an ugly split.

AVB would is still a gamble, but it is a calculated gamble, looks like Levy is trying to make the effort to make sure AVB has what he didn't have at Chelsea, backing to help him with the locker room by keeping on Sherwood (potentially Ledley as well?) and letting AVB bring in his old coaching staff from Porto (i saw that reported earlier today), this would create some semblance of stability and unified messaging to the team, where as with Chelsea he lost the locker room and didn't have the personnel to run his system.

With Spurs he has the personnel to run his system now and the mandate to build going forward, the backing of Levy to shape the team and support from respected organizational figures (Sherwood / King?).  so while it is a risk, is seems like a risk with a big upside.

He likes to play aggressive attacking football, he is sharp and well spoken....this is the type of guy we would all jump for last year if this all happened.  Now we get him, maybe a bit more humble and a bit more driven.  For the options we had AVB was the best choice, and would have been one of the better choices even if there were more names on the market.

Young guy, leading a young team with attacking aggressive football.....i am signed up to watch all of it.  Great signing for us.

&gt;Not enough important passes

[Are you dense? Are you retarded or something?](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_aL228cuWfwo/TQRKpLwIO4I/AAAAAAAAAaI/eW0qRtZaWOI/s1600/real+games+batmanr+goddamn.jpg) Guess how many players played more key passes than Luka Modric last season. 2. A couple of guys named David Silva and Juan Mata, who play free advanced roles. 

&gt;He can't run with the ball  

Do you watch Spurs? Please, again, tell me we don't have someone this useless in this subreddit. I've had a long day, I need to have my faith in humanity re-affirmed. Among deep-lying midfielders, he is #1 in the league in successful dribbles per game. Only Ramires at Chelsea comes close. 

The problem isn't that you're pointing out the obvious; it's that you're batshit insane and pointing out the exact opposite of obvious. You're pointing out shit that isn't true.

Since you're obsessed with fucking stats, here is something I wrote a while back about Luka Modric to someone similarly clueless.



If you must have something empirical to judge Modric on, here are some numbers from the Premier League season:

**Chances Created (Key Passes):**  
1: Mata @ 3pg (102 total)  
2: Silva @ 2.9pg (104)  
3: Modric @ 2.7pg (96)  

This is an incredibly impressive position for a deep-lying playmaker. In fact, he is the only deep-lying player in the top 10 for chances created. You have to go down to Danny Murphy and Mikel Arteta at 2.1pg each (11 and 12 best) before you find someone who isn't an advanced playmaker, winger, or striker. Simply put, he is creating almost as many chances from a deep-lying position as Mata and Silva are in free roles. He creates more chances than players like Bale, Valencia, Nani, RVP, Nasri, etc.

**Passes Per Game:**  
1: Arteta @ 76 (90% accuracy)  
2: Toure @ 75 (90%)  
3: Carrick @ 73 (90%)  
4: Modric @ 70 (87%)  

This may not be terribly remarkable or unexpected by itself, but let's look at passes of 25+ yards among outfield players.

**Long Passes:**  
1: Ashley Williams @ 8.8pg (70% accuracy)  
2: Modric @ 7.6pg (83%)  
[...]  
7: Carrick @ 6pg (82%)  
9: Toure @ 5.5pg (81%)  

This begins to tell us that Modric is more ambitious and incisive with his passing than his competitors. We can take it one step further and look at # of long passes as a percentage of total pass attempts:

Modric: 329/2534 (12%)  
Carrick: 218/2192 (9%)  
Toure: 216/2419 (8%)  
Arteta: 172/2229 (7%)  

So ultimately, Modric attempts and completes a comparable amount of total passes to his competitors, but creates significantly more chances. This, when combined with his significantly higher volume of long passes per game and ratio of long passes to total passes, suggests that Modric is the most incisive and creative deep-lying passer in the country by a pretty comfortable distance.

Obviously players like Toure and Carrick have other qualities and are different types of players, but they--along with Arteta--are really the only deep-lying players that even come close to holding a candle to Modric's creativity. If I try to compare him to players like Danny Murphy or Joe Allen or w/e it's just not worth the time.

Simply put, he is the best at what he does in the league. I mean shit, I didn't even talk about dribbles per game. He's the only deep-lying midfielder on the first PAGE of that stat.

I actually think he's UNDERRATED by a lot of our fans. He is world class.

Nightclubs for example have outdoor smoking areas away from the noise, the party is outside, same applies to gigs where smoking areas are by far the best place to meet people. 

Inner-city pubs with courtyard car parks have been transformed into beer gardens with shelter and outdoor heating, thanks partly to the reduction in drink-driving blood alcohol content but mostly due to the smoking ban. There's now the possibility of tiny weeny little bars where most of the action is outside and you just go inside to get a drink, because everyone is outside anyway. Those venues wouldn't have been a success in the past because people weren't used to sitting outside all night.

The landscape has been transformed by the ban, but on the whole it means people are spending more time sat on nice outdoor seating away from the noise under rain shelters with heating and lighting. It's nice, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it.

Remember the time Luka played Ade in over the top at Stamford Bridge and the big guy found a way to fuck it up after rounding Cech? That should be an assist, but it isn't--through no fault of Luka's.

It's not Luka's problem that he doesn't have Robin van Persie or Sergio Aguero or Wayne Rooney or Didier Drogba to finish his chances. Our top scorer didn't even bring in 20 goals. These guys at the top of the assist list are assisting 30+ goal scorers and playing in teams that score far more goals. 

Key passes are defined as passes that lead directly to an effort on goal. It is a far superior metric to assists when looking at chance creation, because it doesn't take into account the person finishing them. 

If I play a 5 yard square ball to Wayne Rooney and he curls it into the top corner after nutmegging someone, I get an assist for it. If I play a 50 yard angled through ball between 8 defenders and Adebayor puts it into the stands, I've done something much more impressive but I don't get anything on the stat sheet.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"A realistic buyout clause would be something in the neighborhood of (year remaining) * (annual salary). Sometimes, as in this case (or so I believe), Porto's release clause was a deterrent to stop other teams from buying him last summer, so it's much more inflated. So, the ""worth"" of a player to the team can make the release clause spike up - Messi would have a ridiculously high clause simply because he's irreplaceable.

Last summer, Porto lost their coach (AVB) and top player (Falcao), as well as a few others, and many rumours were swirling around Hulk. I believe Porto had Hulk agree to the new contract/clause to keep him from moving last summer, to allow Porto time to properly replace their missing pieces. That's why I find them to be much more willing to negotiate, Chelsea are apparently offering around half of the clause. There was a rumour that Anzi (rich Russian club) offered 90 million Euros or something for Hulk but Porto refused to sell - shows Porto really did not want to let him go last summer.

These numbers are rarely concrete because it's only confirmed in the player's contract, which is quite secret.

true,douchebag_karren,rose,Rose,"You know I find it funny that there isn't a huge Eccleston vs. Tennant issue but a lot of people have this Tennant vs. Smith Issue. 

I don't have said issue. It's the Doctor. People change over time and so do Time Lords. 

What I do have a preference for is the show runner and the writers. I want to feel something, I want to be scared or sad or happy when the characters are. Very rarely do I blame an actor for that, I usually blame the writer, producer and director (Not to say that actors aren't responsible as well, but you all have to remember that if the director didn't want it to look/sound the way that it does. It wouldn't, leaving the main blame on them) 

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I cried more during the Tennant years. I didn't identify with this doctor until The Wedding of River Song. I went through both seasons then saw the two christmas specials, and found both of them very good, and cried at Widow, making The Doctor the Widow and the Wardrobe and Wedding of River Song the only two Smith season episodes I've ever cried at, while there are several episodes during each of the Tennant years that I cried at. The other issue is I'm never crying because the (Smith) Doctor is sad, I cry for River and for the children in that special. Where as I cried for the Doctor (Tennant) in Doomsday (and Rose), I cried for him at ""I don't want to Go."" 

So my rant is not against the actor it's against the writing and the story arch, they aren't engaging me emotionally to the same extent that series 1-4 did . But I don't think Smith has much to do with this. I find him quite funny, and a pretty good Doctor.

We should be focusing on a good, young right-back first and foremost, and possibly think of a player for the right wing. Personally, I want Yossi Benayoun to be a serious candidate for that position. He is a hard worker, clever passer and dribbler, and has a lot of leadership and team experience in a squad and front line that may include wonder kids like Torres (formerly), Marin, Hazard, Mata, and Sturridge. Ramires would also work well there, and with a healthy fixture list I think we could afford another player for the front 3, hopefully a right-sided one, but the man I really miss is Anelka. If he hadn't feuded with AVB, he would be a great goal threat and creator on the right or in the center. A youngster who could be a cheap and good but is Andriy Yarmolenko. He plays for Dynamo Kiev, and with Kranjcar already there, he would be lower on the pecking order.

One of the only reliable ITKs is convinced Vertonghen is still coming and even referred to the recent stuff as ""old news"". Plus the coach of Ajax said it's still ""very close"" and believes it will get done.

As for Sigurdsson, there's really been nothing convincing IMO. No quotes or anything, just a few stories about us hijacking it. I just still find it very strange. Maybe it's my own logic going against what the common opinion in the press seems to be, but I find it so hard to believe he'll turn down Rodgers.

With all that said, I still hope we keep Caulker. I'm sure we'll be losing Bassong and we're probably going to lose king and/or gallas. We've already lost Nelsen. That leaves us with Daws, Younes, Caulker, and one or two old dudes. Even if Vertonghen comes in, I think Caulker will play a part.

WARNING: SPOILERS
--------------------

1) His schtick is to be awkward - where David Tennant brought passion and power to every episode, most of Matt Smith's seem to be more of him bumbling about, attempting to be funny while his companions are more badass than he is.

2) The show has taken on a new feeling with him as the Doctor. While David Tennant was in the role, it was an adventure show! It was always a crazy wild roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. Most of the Matt Smith episodes, especially season 6, have been emotionally intense episodes. Now I'll admit, the Girl Who Waited was intense, but it wasn't an intense I liked; it didn't seem like DW, it was more of a drama than an adventure.

3) The transition from Tennant to Smith cost us Rose, Jack, Donna, and other fantastic characters. Yes, we got Amy, and yes, she is more often more of a badass than the Doctor (a problem Tennant never faced, well, except maybe with Donna), and Rory was a fool until he got all serious after being plastic, but the fact remains. They made a fresh start and the characters since just haven't been able to fill the DW universe with as much excitement and create as strong of connections with us the viewers as the rest. I cried when Donna had to go, and I damn well cried when Rose got trapped at the end of Doomsday. I know I won't when Amy or Rory or both go away this coming season, and nor will I be sad when Matt Smith gets replaced.

4) The aliens. DW is a science fiction show, and the aliens have always been great. But the era of the 11th sapped the coolness from so many. The army of angels? Nowhere near as scary as Blink - since when do they break necks and speak? That creepy hotel episode? Woohoo, a sci-fi version of the tale of the labyrinth and the minotaur, very transparent, very plodding. And that episode with Greg and Stormageddon - yay, love beat the Cyberman transformation proce...wait, what?

Well that's my shpeel, upvote or downvote as you will. No TL:DR, if you care, read it.

It is incredibly disrespectful. Playing football is their jobs and while they are contracted to a team, that team should be their only focus. Imagine if you had a job and then constantly complaied that you wanted to play for a competitor. Its disrespectful and unprofessional. If you sign a contract, you should be willing to see it out. The club takes a risk in signing players for a long period that they could become deadweight. I am sick to death of players not willing to be bound by the terms which THEY agreed too. It's a two way street, player power needs to be seriously curtailed.

If they are disrespectful to their club, censure and dock their wages. If it continues, sack them and sue them for the value of their transfer fee and the value of the contract as specific performance would not be appropriate.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I think you're being far too idealistic, unrealistic, and harsh. It's just not the way this industry of football works. And your assertion that Modric is constantly complaining is laughable. This out-of-context and tonally misrepresented quote is the only thing he's said all summer. 

And last season, once the window closed he was a model professional. He did his job (as well as anyone in the league) and didn't say a peep. 

There's also an incredibly strong possibility that Modric was told by Levy that he would be allowed to leave if we didn't achieve CL football, in which case he's well within his rights to admit he wants to move on.

Because of the public nature of football, I don't think this is comparable to an ordinary job. I think if anything it's more like the feeling of outgrowing one job and wanting to make more money and gain more recognition and be challenged more at another job. 

Normal careers last a hell of a lot longer than that of a professional athlete. I know it's kind of taboo to some people to have sympathy for someone who makes ridiculous money, but people are a little insensitive towards athletes I feel. I agree that sometimes player power is a bit ridiculous, like Rooney publicly saying he wants to leave in order to leverage a new contract, but Modders is not in the same ballpark as something like that.

true,ZappAstrim,eng-hampshire,/r/WinchesterUK,"My major issue is with the poor electoral system we have in this country. You can essentially only vote for one of three parties and even then most of the time it is one of two. The first past the post system is horribly divisive and really quashes any chances for actual change. 

I much prefer the system in Germany for example where you can vote for a third party  (like the pirate party) and they then form part of the government with some actual (if minor) say in politics. In a couple of German states the pirate party has had 9% of the vote if I am not mistaken. This system allows for different parts of the populace to feel like they actually get a say in things (and they actually do!). In the UK your vote for such a party is thrown away and nothing happens. This makes the system seem like a real farce. Unfortunately we squandered our opportunity for electoral reform recently and I doubt we will be having a debate about it for a long time in this country. 

I blame the political system here for the massive apathy the British public have towards politics. If you cast your vote for a party that represents you and your views and see your opinion completely discarded year on year I can't really blame anyone for giving up caring (e.g. bear-maketh-the-man).

That can't happen, because Lis is gone. 

In her own show, it ended with ""And the story continues, forever...""

At first I thought they should just leave it be, but I think if it was done tastefully, it would be nice to have closure. The Brig's death was handled well enough. Maybe a letter from Sarah to the Doctor, similar to Madame de Pompadour's letter? Or even a letter from Luke and/or K-9? There's that clip from season 7 shooting where [spoiler](/s ""Amy appears to be reading a letter to the Doctor while the Doctor breaks down but Amy seems largely unaffected. Turns out I think it ended up being the Doctor breaking down alone and Karen just sitting there reading a script or something, but prior to hearing that I thought it would be a nice way to bring it up. Amy never met Sarah Jane, so she wouldn't have any clue why the Doctor would react that way, and she probably wouldn't have much of a reaction herself."")

*1. as some other users have stated, they didn't see it when it first aired. people are just discovering the whole tragic ""oh no! the Doctor and rose are in separate universes! sad panda!"" and the ""human Doctor for rose YAY!"" thing. To them, it's new.

*2. The whole Doctor Rose love thing is a deviation from the norm. In the classic series, companions didn't fall in love with the Doctor--the show was more about the places and the story arc. But with the revival of the show, it's a whole new ball game. Right out of the gate we were given Rose and she fell for the mad man with the box. For those familiar with the show, it was something different, and that made people remember it. 

*3. Let's face it, we all like a little romance in our lives, even if it is just between two fictional characters. Now, Whovians may not be the type to flock to romantic comedies, but if there's Daleks, Cybermen, Science fiction, and interesting things on the screen, we may tolerate or even enjoy some romantic drama.

true,Lastaria,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"1) Welcome to the Doctor, may of his incarnations schtick is to be awkward. And I have to disagree with the comment that his companions are more badass. I like Rory but the Chuck Norris like worship of him that goes on is a little ridiculous.

2) Good, a new Doctor should bring anew feel. the show is doing it's job. This has helped keep it fresh for 50 years. Doctor Who should at times be a Drama and at times an adventure.

3) Really really cannot agree that Amy is more badass than the Doctor. At times she can just be plain annoying. Though she is a lot better than Rose. But companions are different each time. You cannot always feel the same for them. Most of those new to Doctor Who loved Rose. I was not so bothered when she left the show and I rather liked Martha and was a bit annoyed she was only in the show so briefly.
4) It was hard to ever live up to Blink. If they were to use the Angels again they had to bring new dimensions to them. To a degree I am with you as I am not sure it worked so much. Frankly it might have been best that he never brought the Angels back and just left us with the fond memories of that episode. I also agree with that episode with greg, but then I do not like that character and that story was a little weak, one of my least favourite episodes in the new run of Who after the Slitheen episodes and the one with the monster that turned someone into a paving stone. But Moffatt is trying to bring new things into the show and establish new villains rather than just relying on just the old villains. Experimentation can mean things may not be great at the start, some may get tossed on the skip, others my blossom into great re-accuring villains.

Stick with it. May come to enjoy more the 11th Doctors run, if not at some point he will regenerate into a new Doctor.

It is an unfair and biased view to consider Dempsey and Suarez have a ""similar game"" based on this set of data. Dempsey's performance this season has been the best he has ever had. It is probably (but not definitely) the apex of his career. On the other hand, this has been one of the worst seasons in Liverpool's history. Suarez's performance, compared with ois own personal career, is actually significantly poor. In addition, Dempsey has been played in multiple positions this year, as a left midfielder, attacking midfielder and also as a forward. Playing as a midfielder, it is natural for him to have a higher number of passes. On the other hand, Suarez has been played predominantly as a center forward this past season, which means his high number of passes mean a totally different thing from Dempsey's.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"&gt;You know I find it funny that there isn't a huge Eccleston vs. Tennant issue but a lot of people have this Tennant vs. Smith Issue.

I don't think anyone would admit it, but I think there wouldn't be as much controversy over Smith and Tennant if RTD had still been writing during the Smith run. I think a lot of people liked the RTD style of writing, and blame Matt/Moffat that the writing isn't exactly the same as RTD.

&gt;Very rarely do I blame an actor for that, I usually blame the writer, producer and director 

You're already on my good side! It always bugs me when people I'm around(Or people on the internet) go straight for an actor. Especially when it's an actor they know. ""Oh my gosh, So and So's performance was horrible in that movie! What was going through his mind? Why would he act like that?"" I have explained so many times that, with 90% certainty, they acted that way because it's how the director asked them to act. Or when they complain how all the actors act in a certain way, and I try to explain to them that the director does this to keep a level of consistency with their vision. A movie would be very off putting if one actor acted like a Shakespearian actor, another like a soap opera, and the other like a Hollywood action flick.

As for the rest, I can feel you. For me, personally, it's the other way around. I find myself way more emotional during the Moffat era. Of course, it's much closer to the type of emotion I prefer. I got teary eyed seeing The Doctor not wanting to see the TARDIS' soul go back, or even the subtle moment where The Doctor stayed up working on the TARDIS attempting to get a speech function working. My most emotional moments are often the ones that are beyond words. Another instance is when The Doctor drops off Amy and Rory during God Complex, and Rory comes walking out of the house with three wine glasses, looking for The Doctor. He didn't need to say anything for me to feel emotional towards him, as his actions spoke for him. Even the fact that he brought out three wine glasses.

The RTD era, though, always felt like I was being *told* that I should be sad. Which caused me to roll my eyes more than anything. 10 shouting about how he could be so much more, or how he doesn't want to go. I don't really like that 'in your face' kind of emotion.

Just difference in opinions, though. Good example is a friend of mine and myself recently watched My Name is Bruce. Now, I'm a huge B movie fan, and especially a Bruce Campbell fan. If you're not a fan of either of these two, let me say that it's very much an acquired taste. This movie proved it as I was laughing my ass off the entire time, and thought the subtle(And not so subtle) jabs at B horror films were brilliant. My friend, on the other hand, chuckled a few times and thought it was an absolutely horrible movie. I can't change that the type of humor in the film just wasn't to his liking, and he didn't get quite as many references as I did.",0,1340954763,null,0,false,0,c576jcb,t3_vqzpe,t1_c576jcb,t1_c5733vn,null,1429257630,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

We'll have a new Doctor, new companion, new executive producer, new version of the theme, and people will still be posting their Rose/10 fanfiction. 

As for point 3, it's probably just me, but romance...I can take it or leave it. In *Doctor Who*, I'm a bit more critical. Romance - even sexual tension and chemistry - was never integral to the foundation of the show. And for all the brilliant, wonderful and amazing things that new Who has brought to the table, sexing everything up has not been one of my favorite elements.

He took up the role without considering, whatsoever, the almost 50 years behind the show, nor it's culture. He took it as just another job, which normally would be fine. However, this isn't how Who culture works, and he never bothered to find out enough about Who before to know this, nor has he cared since he left the role. He doesn't want to come back(even for a cameo), he doesn't want to acknowledge the role, and he actively admits that he did it so he could say that he played in a children's show.

Now I'm not saying you have to be a major fan of Doctor Who, as many of the actors feverishly admit that they're not. Paul McGann doesn't even watch TV, let alone Doctor Who. However, he, nor any other Doctor, is above interacting with fans that recognize them as The Doctor. The sore thumb in all of this is Eccleston, and I have lost respect for him for it.

true,brauchen,mcgann,McGann,"It's a kids' show with lots of fun scary sexy bits for grownups, too. It's soft science-fiction with a lot of fantasy elements. Generally, each episode has a monster-of-the-week. On top of that, there's a big overarching plot.  

There's this guy, and he's an alien. He calls himself the Doctor. He travels through time and space in a living ship called the TARDIS, who disguises herself as an old police box. 

The Doctor gets a bit lonely, so he likes to pick up good-looking young people and invites them to travel with him. This almost always ends badly, and their lives are ruined, and then he drops them off back home and looks sad and vows he'll never do it again and then he does it again anyway. He also tries to find a peaceful solution every time they encounter a monster, and the monsters are usually all like ""peace is for losers!"" and then the Doctor is forced to kill them all, which gives him a massive guilt complex.

The Doctor has a few archenemies. One of them is the Master, a smug Time Lord who was the Doctor's best friend in high school but now wants to take over the universe. He and the Doctor tend to act like an old married couple when they're around each other. Another one is Davros, a mad scientist who created a race of evil space nazis in metal suits called the Daleks. 

The Doctor dies a lot. When he dies, he can change into a different actor, which also gives him a different personality each time. 

There are tons of writers and tons of episodes. And apart from the TV show, there are also novels and games and radio shows and old non-canon specials and new non-canon specials and discussion shows and comics and cartoons and board games and flash animations and so on. Some of those are only for grownups. And they all contradict each other, so it can get a bit confusing. The TV show is the main canon. 

The show stopped for a bit last century, had a canon movie in the 90's, and returned (picking up the main story again) in 2005. You can just start with the 2005 series, if you like.

1. An ashtray has been provided. Great! I'll make sure I use it...
2. No ashtray, but a bin? Fine, I'll stub out the cig, and roll it just above the filter until the remaining tobacco/ash falls out on the ground. I can stomp that out, and it'll disappear with the next bit of rain. The filter/butt can then safely go in the bin.
3. No bin? OK, there's a drain/gutter over there. I'll do the same as above in terms of getting the ash out - or if it's raining I can just do this with the whole cig - but the butt goes into the drain. Some people don't like putting filters in drains in the belief it will block them, but I think that's an urban myth if you're putting it into a system that can handle British rainfall
4. No ashtray, no bin _and_ no drain?! Wow, must be out in the countryside. OK, it's going to be a bit stinky but if you need to smoke out here: first priority is not starting a fire, so make sure the cig is properly extinguished.

The fact is most people aren't involved in bettering their conditions and often belittle those that do so instead they just envy the conditions of others (who are willing to struggle for improvements) and cry that everyone should be dragged down to their level, such an attitude only benefits exploitative managers which is perhaps why it is almost encouraged.

true,BoltenMoron,num11,,"Yes he was a professional I do agree and I commend him for his work during the season. No where did I assert that Modric constantly complained, nor was it meant to be implied. I do agree that if he had an agreement that Levy would sell him then he would be well within his right to have an issue. If Modric wants a move then it should be done in private which is basic professionalism and courtesy.

I do agree that that football is much more in the public arena than a regular profession, however this should mean more discretion on the players behalf. If a player wants flexibility then sign a shorter contract, or have a reasonable release clause. Players sign long contracts for security but increased security comes with decreased flexibility.  

Let me make this absolutely clear, I have no problem with the amount of money professional football players earn. They are the reason people watch football and should be entitled to the full financial benefit of providing that entertaiment. Furthermore, as you have stated, their career is short compared to other careers, so they should be compensated adequately.

I do agree, this comment by Modric is inoccuous and is nowhere near the level of misbehaviour committed by Tevez or Rooney. His behaviour at the start of last season was abhorrent but he has been professional since. However, I do think this kind of public statement in the media especially when possible transfers are being negotiated should be strongly condemned.

Look, I am just sick of players publicly expressing discontent in order for them to escape a contractual obligation which they committed to. Just becaue their profession is unusual should not give them a reason to be exempt from laws of contract or equity. This may be idealistic but I think it is realistic that players should think of the future and request flexible contractual terms. Harsh? maybe but it is certainly fair that a player be required to perform for the duration of the contract.

The 'child rapist' as you call him has not been convicted of rape.

In Minnesota, people suspected of sex crimes can be forced into a treatment programme - they say that as it's not a punishment, there is no reason for a trial or conviction. Over here, we have a principle of innocent until proven guilty. As US authorities were not willing to provided assurances that he would receive a trial, it would violate his rights to be extradited.

In the O'dwyer case, there isn't a question over whether he will receive a trial. You can argue what he did should be considered a crime at all, but that is an entirely different point of law.

The report from the [High Pay Commission](http://highpaycommission.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/HPC-IR.pdf) talks a little bit about highly paid executives but also highlights that a lot of bonuses are based in stock options for instance. This makes the actual level of payment more difficult to determine. They probably wouldn't be included in the stats you've pointed to, as they're technically not salaries, even though it's still payment for the work you've done.

Good justification for the two positions. But, as I argued, there's other things to consider with those roles. An okay starting point though, I gather. Hope your job's going well anyway.

In response to the private vs public pay increases: these increases actually fluctuate out of phase. I'm struggling to find a reference for this (think I read an article on liberalconspiracy about it). I'll return with said reference.

But the point is that, sure the public sector might be doing better *now*, but soon the private will be doing better than the public in a year or two (or not, if the economy tanks).

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; Tell me again why O'Dwyer is being extradited and the child rapist isn't?

Because the law depends on complex, nuanced issues of jurisprudence (which means two randomly-chosen examples are unlikely to be realistically comparable), and because the law doesn't care how ""yucky"" you personally happen to find the crime the defendant is charged with (remember: not even convicted of), or how emotional you get over it.

I think this guy is likely as guilty as hell, and I think child molesters are the scum of the earth, but I choose to differentiate myself *from* scum by upholding certain principles... like ""the Rule of Law"", ""entitlement to a fair trial before punishment"" and ""innocent until proven guilty"".

If you're *opposed* to those principles, and would rather punish someone who's already served their time for their proven crimes, or imprison someone for life on the *suspicion* they've done wrong, might I recommend moving to somewhere like the USA, where the whole ""human rights"" and ""innocent until proven guilty"" things are apparently regarded as old hat?

I think Richard o'Dwyer being extradited is heinous, and - given the USA's recent experiments with *third-world-dictatorship* levels of disrespect for human rights - the Anglo-American extradition treaty is a clear and present danger to the Rule of Law in the UK.

Maybe I'm guilty of using the word attacked as in the OP but this just seems to highlight a double standard.

US's most wanted paedophile vs. someone whose condom allegedly broke during otherwise consensual sex.

Paedophile gets human rights (fair enough. He's still a human) and stays, alleged condom breaker or non-wearer* is ordered by Scotland Yard to leave an Embassy where he's seeking asylum.

Just highlighting a disparity that came to mind when I saw the headline. I'd just come over from /r/wikileaks after reading about Assange's plight and wondered how two similar cases are apparently dealt with so differently. At face value the OP's seems a more worthy extraditee than Assange.

Solution? Invest in NRG drinks early on. Set your work-rate to high (three hearts) during matches early on &amp; refill at half-time, if necessary. Initially, you need to increment your team-bars through passes and assists. Once your team-bar is around 80% you can cruise through a match with medium-level (two hearts) work-rate.

Renew your contract with each start rating increase. If you happen to get through your star ratings quickly, (i.e. every five matches or so) renew your contract every two star rises. 

Your first priority in terms of purchases should be property - trust me, do NOT buy any other lifestyle items before you have bought all properties.

Try to ignore the fact that on the walk to the bus stop you could meet customers who you have denied benefits. Remember when you used to help people get jobs.

Then there is crofton manor, but I was there for over a year and tbh i didnt like it, the turn out can dwindle to an hour in winter and the fields can get quite crowed. The only bonus is if you like entering shows, its all right there as crofton holds shows all through winter and summer in there olympic sized indoor school. the hacking is meh, there is a main road right outside which is a pain, but  you can hack down to the beach in good weather. 
And then finally my yard! Im at woodleigh, in funtley, its split into 3 yards, two at the bottom of funtley hill and one at the top, the top is the best ;D im there, turn out is great even during the winter months, during the summer you can have nighttime turn out if you want, the top yard has american style barn too!

&gt; **During O'Dwyer's extradition hearing**, it was held by the judge that the offences alleged were also illegal under UK law. Whereas TV-Links was able to successfully argue it was a 'mere conduit' under the EU Electronic Commerce Regulations 2002, aggregating content 'they did not select or modify', O'Dwyer had exerted considerable control over the content hosted on TV-Shack, and therefore the allegations, if true, constituted a crime in the UK.[14]

... so you're right on that point.

Equally, regarding your claim that:

&gt; You can't be extradited from this country to the US without breaking UK law

... perhaps I've misread or misunderstood what I've read.  Certainly I took phrases like ""[the Act has been criticised... for allowing extradition to proceed **on the basis of offences in U.S. rather than UK law**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_O%27Dwyer#2003_U.S..E2.80.93UK_Extradition_Treaty)"" and ""[allows the US to extradite UK citizens and others **for offences committed against US law**, even though the alleged offence may have been committed in the UK by a person living and working in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Act_2003#Controversy)"" (my emphasis) to imply that an offence was not necessary under UK law in order for extradition proceedings to begin and succeed.

Similarly, I'm curious how you'd explain the case of Ian Norris (former Morgan Crucible Chief Exec.), who was apparently accused of price-fixing (a crime in the USA *but not in the UK* [during the period in which it was alleged he engaged in it](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/norris-loses-us-extradition-battle-but-says-he-will-appeal-877866.html)), and who lost the case and was due to be extradited, until an appeal heard by the House of Lords overruled the previous ruling.

Nope, not picking sides at all. ""Loyalty"" to a doctor is an interesting concept but one that I've never worried about.

At first there were a few moments where the 11th Doctor shocked me with the occasional ""off"" line...which struck me as being pretty inconsistent...like when the Doctor says something about River being a woman and then realizing he's said something offensive, goes, ""Oh shut up, I'm dying."" (I think it was in Let's Kill Hitler.)

There was also a moment or two in the beginning of 11's first season when he tended to snap / be very grouchy at Amy for no reason. But I think this was due to the fact that the character was brand new and the actor/writers were just getting settled into the role.

11 is more distant and cerebral (like a detective or as Moffat would say, ""Sherlock in space"") while 10 is chummy and likes running / jumping / falling like an action hero. A doctor for every mood and occasion, so it's not really about taking sides - otherwise you miss out on some good stuff.

I think that 9, if he'd had another season, would probably have ended up having the overall attitude of 11, but with the moodiness of 10 multipled tenfold. The episode Dalek gets into some morally ambiguous territory - painting 9 as an antihero - which, while I like it, probably wouldn't have worked in the long run. Unfortunately because 9's run was so short, I just watch him for nostalgic purposes and don't really see him as an in-depth character like 10 and 11.

I agree with the comments that say that it's all in the writing and directing. (Case in point, the infamous ""Blink"" episode.) The actors are important but only in that they help the writers get the story across. The atmosphere of the episodes for 11 I like more than 10. The special effects and production budget probably has something to do with this, but also Moffat has a more whimsical (and terrifying) spin to the whole thing, what with little girls and imaginary friends and the power of imagination bringing back an entire dimension (and a little child's closet being the scariest place in the universe).

I've only watched a few of the old episodes because frankly, it's hard to hear what they're saying (old audio quality) and the fact that some story arcs go on for extended serials (like a soap opera or something) is too much for my addled attention-span-stunted 2012 brain. I tried watching the Three Doctors and the one where the Fourth Doctor goes to Paris and faces the guy who plays the villain from Indiana Jones. Also the one with the original Silurians.

My opinions are not by any means controversial or new but I thought I would throw them into the pot. I just finished watching Sherlock Season 2 and Moffat does rather like to endlessly layer on the tricks and story-telling showmanship. He does have a set way that he likes to tell stories so it's good to be able to go back to the old stuff!",0,1340987814,null,0,false,0,c57baob,t3_vqzpe,t1_c57baob,t3_vqzpe,null,1429259936,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

O'Dwyer's lawyers tried to use the case to show it wasn't a crime, however the judge was specific in his ruling that until the law was repealed it was, irrespective of whether the CPS ever prosecuted on it.

The home office document states that:

&gt; Under these various treaties both parties undertook to extradite accused persons on 
the presentation of evidence that would justify the committal for trial of the person 
sought if the offence of which he was accused had been committed in the territory of 
the requested party.

Note that the ruling is that the case would be taken to trial though, not formally against the law.  Plus the person doesn't have to be convicted of the case in this country, just that they would be taken to court to find out if they are guilty or not.  The actual trial should still happen in the other country.

I think in the case of Ian Norris, and I don't really know anything about this, that the original extradition was on four counts, one of which was not illegal during the period which he was alleged to have engaged in it.  The Lords took the view that this meant it should be thrown out (the high court decided that there was grounds for 'dishonest price fixing' which it claimed was an offence, but the Lords said it wasn't).  Subsequently he was extradited for the remaining three counts (destroying evidence and conspiring to pervert the course of justice amongst them).

&gt; The trouble with TV-Links is that the CPS dropped the case, so I don't think there was ever a ruling on whether it was illegal or not

Valid point - I'd only read simplified/possibly-incorrect accounts that reported what O'Dwyer did was ""not illegal*"" but from what you say that wasn't actually the case.  I can't find any details of this precise point of jurisprudence though - can you just humour me and back up your argument with a link? ;-)

&gt; The home office document states that:

&gt;&gt; Under these various treaties both parties undertook to extradite accused persons on the presentation of evidence that would justify the committal for trial of the person sought if the offence of which he was accused had been committed in the territory of the requested party.

Your'e right that this statement doesn't say ""refusal to prosecute in the UK = no extradition"", but (annoyingly) that statement can still be read to imply that the offence needn't be an offence under UK law.  I.e., that what you do *may* be legal in the UK, but still result in extradition to the USA (what I asserted above).

Again, it's vague and non-specific (it hinges on whether by ""an offence"" they mean ""an offence in both jurisdictions"" or just ""an offence in the foreign jurisdiction"", which they may have clarified elsewhere) - can you provide a link resolving this ambiguity?  I'm not trying to be a dick - I'd just like more than the unsourced word of a random internet poster before I conclude I was definitely wrong and change my opinion.

&gt; I think in the case of Ian Norris... that the original extradition was on four counts, one of which was not illegal during the period which he was alleged to have engaged in it.

From what I've read (and the links I provded previously), the USA initially attempted to extradite him only on the issue of price-fixing, then re-issued a *different* extradition request (this time on the charge of obstruction of justice) once the House of Lords overturned the initial one on appeal.

My point here was that the lower courts *permitted* an extradition on a charge that wasn't illegal under UK law when the offence took place (and hence - because you can't retroactively prosecute - *wasn't illegal* in the UK), and were only overturned on appeal by the HoL... suggesting that there may be (or have been) a precedent that one could be extradited for offences in the USA that weren't illegal in the UK, and only the subsequent appeal to the HoL (which *may* have established a new precedent on those grounds *or* may only have pertained to this specific case) prevented that extradition from going forwards.

The troubling thing is that it's happening in an era wherein the other top clubs are only strengthening their iron grips on their own positions, so as players snub us to go to them, we weaken even further in relation.

The preceding stuff is worrying enough by itself, but I think in the case of Sigurdsson it's even more of a slap in the face because our position with regard to his transfer appeared to be unassailable only a few short days ago.

I do not think *we will become* a mid table team. We currently *are* a mid table team, both literally and practically. This is a very serious problem for us. Gylfi not signing is a pretty succinct illustration of just how bad the problem is. In order to help everyone understand where the negative crowd is coming from, allow me to explain:

1. We were unable to sign a very good prospect that really wanted to play under our manager. He elected to sign for a side with no manager at this time. This is almost entirely due to us not having room for his modest wages. That should alarm everyone.

2. Part of the reason we do not have room for his wages is that our prize money and TV revenue are down due to our league postion and lack of CL football. Another reason is that we have a lot of deadwood on our roster at some startling wage levels.

3. Simply clearing the deadwood will not fix our biggest problem: we need to be in CL to retain our stars and attract new ones.

4. If we are not in the CL at the end of this upcoming season, I predict with relative certainty that at least 3 of the following 4 players will leave: Suarez, Reina, Agger, Lucas.

5. We have an exciting new manager but no exciting new talent for him to work with, and likely not sufficient funds to compensate for our lack of CL football when enticing transfer targets.

There is a convention that we use ""seasons"" for the original run of the show, but the BBC Wales show has ""series"".   This isn't just arbitrary, but reflects contemporary usage, and the changing usage of the words over here.

In 1963, when Doctor Who was started, it was on a model similar to the classic American model of having new episodes all-year round, with a new series debuting in the autumn (or fall, if you will).  For example, the first season had 42 episodes, aired from November 1963 through to September 1964.  Compare this to the US television show The Twilight Zone, which had 36 episodes in that year.

However, British television abandoned that model much sooner, with the term ""series"" coming in to use for short runs of episodes (typically 6 or 13), and only really soap-operas, with full year round production and no discernible season boundaries remaining as fixtures.  (Often ""series"" will be independently commissioned, without any standing production office between runs of episodes. Actors and writers will be contracted for one block at a time - options on actors for several years will be rare!)  Meanwhile, as Doctor Who reduced in episode count - first in 1970 with the transition to colour, and then again in the mid-1980s with the reduction from 13 ""hour-long"" episodes to 14 ""half-hour"" ones, it retained an association with the term ""season"" as it was part of an existing numbered sequence.",0,1341000194,null,0,1341000651,0,c57eixl,t3_vsl45,t1_c57eixl,t1_c57dckq,null,1429261472,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Well lauded, admired by the likes of Ferguson (""His corner kicks are worth 10 million pounds""), available for relatively low transfer fee. Now imagine if there was competition for his signature and we paid him higher wages than expected. How would you feel about that now? In today's markets, wages are often just as important as transfer fees. A player who earns 60k a week will cost you 12 million over a 4 year contract. **12 Million Pounds**. If that is the wage offer from Tottenham, why do you think he is necessarily worth it? Everybody keeps saying ""Oh, we can't compete financially, we're doomed."" Could it be that Rodgers feels that Sigurdsson isn't worth paying 12 million in wages? Maybe he considers 30k/week a fair price, but not 60? Even a 10k difference per week works out to 2 million per year. 

We bitched when Hodgson brought in Konchesky, saying he wasn't good enough, even though he had actually gotten pretty good ratings in that previous season with Fulham and our manager then was familiar with him. Now, we bitch when Rodgers decides (allegedly) that Sigurdsson is not worth paying so much. We can and should provide our opinions and speculate on things like which players are suitable targets, where they should play and so on, but how long are we going to bitch and moan before a single ball has been kicked? 

Is it possible we fail in this transfer window? Sure. Is it possible that Rodgers ends up performing worse that Hodgson? Sure. Do you think the bitching and moaning now is going to help any of that? 

I'm not saying we can't criticize, because we can and should. But criticize after something actually bad has happened, and don't start going all doom and gloom.

Sigurdsson had 1/2 of a good season at a small club that had no other goal scoring midfielders. I agree, he has a ton of potential, but chasing flavours of the month is a surefire way to overpay. 

You don't find value in the market by chasing players like Sigurdsson. You find value by locating players which are overlooked. Newcastle didn't get to their position by purchasing players of his ilk. In fact, they did the opposite. 

In my 30 years following the club I have seen hundreds of deals fall through and hardly ever would that single signing have changed our fortunes. Likewise, I've seen dozens of signings happen that seemed to have come from nowhere. 

Take a step back, wait a couple months and judge the transfer season then. Better, wait until this time next year and make any judgments. Sigurdsson could be coming off a dismal season and a shrewd LFC signing could be the Young Player of the Year. Stranger things have happened.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've had experience with the Job Centre before but being a young adult I have no idea of what it's been like in the past and if it was any better or worse.  
  

My experience with them was depressing as shit though, first time I tried to get help I was going there for months and months trying to look for jobs whilst having not that much experience at the time. Not once did I receive a payment though, I inquired every week and then asked for leads on how to get the money I needed to be directed to a call centre who then directed me straight back to the Job Centre all the while feeling like this was some horrible and torturous game of cat and mouse but the mouse doesn't even exist.  
  
The next time I went to them, I had a job at the time but my employers gave me less then the 16 hours that these governmental departments use to gauge whether you deserve any benefits. The contract my employers had me sign didn't guarantee me a certain amount of hours a week and they very frequently tossed me aside when I wasn't desperately needed (They're still technically my employer, it's been since September 2011 since they last called me in to work).  
  
So I ended up in this situation of being very poor and incapable of relying on my job to pay the rent, let alone bills and food. I wanted to get the hell out of this slump so I got onto a foundation course at a local university but now I have to pay for this course as well and there is no form of financial help for mature students doing part time study (or at least there were none that I knew of or could find).

Instead of telling me ""go to a city council building and you can sort out housing benefit etc there"" he assumes I'm trying to cheat the system and starts accusing me of that whilst openly expressing his glee for the circumstance he is in, he then starts telling me that I wont get any help until I drop out of my foundation course.

Although evolution will not happen without great struggle and sacrifice.  We can't change anything without sacrifice.

Technology has the potential to remove the need for enough menial jobs that a huge shift in culture and the current system is inevitable.  Once we have full control over things like printers that can manipulate things at a atomic layer and robots that do all the current menial work like warehousing, driving, cleaning, care, something has to change.   It'll be interesting.

Maybe one day, we'll be free from the need to go to work 9-5 to feed the economy, because if a robot can do everything a human can, something has to change.  Maybe not.  Either way, the future is interesting.

true,ravniel,num11,,"It's not the classiest move ever, but I can see their perspective to some degree.  They had a pretty desirable transfer target in Vertonghen, but his willingness to tell the media *ad nauseam* that he wanted only Spurs meant they couldn't get any kind of bidding war going.  Jan even told the media he thought Ajax was being a little unreasonable asking for so much money.  That put Levy completely in the driver's seat: he could be quite confident that there was no reason to rush (very little danger of getting poached), and thus no reason to pay a cent more than he felt was fair.  I suspect the club money-men are a little peeved that Jan placed negotiating leverage so firmly in the hands of a world-renowned tightwad, and are trying to make him share the burden of a lower transfer fee.

So like I said, not the classiest thing ever, but I very seriously doubt that Jan behaved the way clubs want their major transfer targets to behave.  Aside from a couple half-hearted ""well, sure, I *guess* I could go to Arsenal""s, Jan had only one message since basically the last day of the season: hurry the fuck up, Ajax, I've chosen Tottenham and it'd be nice if you'd get out of my way.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"While I would normally agree, Doctor Who is something that people need to at least understand the classic series. It's very much an ingrained part of the show, unlike something like Mission Impossible or the new Star Trek. Two movie franchises that are completely independent of their predecessors(Except for Spock).

Also, too many times on /r/doctorwho I see a blatant disregard/disrepsect for the classic series. Not just 'I can't watch it because it's too old', but flat out saying the old canon doesn't count because it's Classic Who, or because the events described happened before the Time War.

But, on top of that, it's just a matter of understanding and appreciating the series. Too many people think the RTD era *is* Doctor Who, and that anything else *isn't* Doctor Who. However, it's because they don't have an appreciation for Doctor Who as a whole. They haven't seen where it came from, and what the history is.

I guess the bottom line is that the old stuff is still Doctor Who, has a major influence on New Who, and is still worth watching. Not recommending it to someone, in my opinion, is ridiculous for all kinds of reasons. The new James Bond movies are radically different from the old ones, but that fact wouldn't stop me from recommending them to people. Same thing with Doctor Who.

If they cannot be described using 2 or 3 existing words then the likelihood is that they will be borrowed and bastardised. 

I see no problem with this, after all English is rife with words and terms taken from other cultures. 

However Welsh is still adapting and changing, different spellings of words are becoming acceptable (pobl / pobol) etc. 

One popular organic word is 'pobty ping' which replaces meicrodon as the Welsh term for microwave oven.

It's one thing to see the [10] Guy meme and giggle because I know the feeling or whatever, but when someone 25+ years old is walking around in a ""smoke weed erryday"" t-shirt, or when people go out in public high in general, it sickens me a little too.

Going out in public high is equal to doing it drunk. Sure, most of us like getting messed up sometime, but do it at home or in an environment where it's accepted (night club or whatever). When I'm out grocery shopping, sober, high people look like complete fucking morons and I don't want to put up with their shit. If we're all high at a club or get together at someone's place, cool. I greatly enjoy that. Around the general public, though? No one wants to hear about your drug use or see it in action. Not even us level-headed smokers. Disclaimer before you call me on it, I have gone out high before, and I consider it a mistake. I always regret it and think about how stupid I was being to do something like that.

To swing it back around to being fully on topic, though, I wouldn't like it if they put a weed reference in Dr. Who either. Every show has a drug episode of some kind, but I think this one could come up with something a *hell* of a lot more creative for it than ""hey look, weed"".

I wonder though about having a black hole on a planetary surface? Maybe the Eye on Gallifrey is also just a link to the actual Eye located in space where Omega created it?

Don't go out looking to buy a breed of dog that could be potentially mistaken for a dangerous breed.  

There are thousands upon thousands of dogs that need a home, so rather than buying a dog like one would a car (because you like the look of it) or a sofa, re-home one that needs re-homing.

Dogs aren't a fashion accessory. . . . well, far too many people think they are hence the explosion in the number of ""dangerous "" breeds being purchased rather than people re-homing dogs in need.

Personally I'm terrified of the AVB appointment. But then when I consider the alternatives, I think this might just be the right time to take a risk. I have a nervous feeling about it, but that doesn't mean I'm going to shit on the move. I trust Levy, and I'm not prepared to judge someone based on such a small timeframe while having no inside knowledge.

In the long run, I want him to maintain that position just cause I'm sure he'd boss the midfield more often.

We JUST signed Hazard, which will likely result in Mata going out wide, a position he's not natural at. Do we want to make another one of our best players play in an unnatural position? Ramires is great and if we still played a 4-3-3, I'd be the first person to say put him in at RCM. But he's a waste at RW, imo.

Even if you look at it with what we have now, we could live and still do well without Modric. Modric adds great depth and has tremendous upside though.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"There's a fundamental flaw with this:

&gt; This is almost entirely due to us not having room for his modest wages.

Except it's not - we just sold Dirk Kuyt, so we definitely have room for Gylfi's wages. Us not signing him is due to us not thinking his wage demands represent a realistic valuation of his place in the squad.

This is a *good thing* - we've been wasteful with wages in the past. Only last sumer we shipped out a number of players eating up our wages. You touch on this yourself:

&gt; Another reason is that we have a lot of deadwood on our roster at some startling wage levels.

Yes, Gylfi's a good prospect, but if he's demanding the 60-70k/wk that's being rumoured, then he'll be on higher/equal wages to Carroll, a comparable prospect - proven over a season in the Championship and half a season in the PL. The difference is, Carroll is one of 2-3 strikers and Gylfi would be one of 8-odd midfielders.

&gt; Simply clearing the deadwood will not fix our biggest problem: we need to be in CL to retain our stars and attract new ones.

No we don't - it's not like Tottenham signed Modric and van der Vaart *after* qualifying for the CL. They found gems from weaker leagues/teams (Gylfi, but surely we'll find another) and big club players whose careers needed revival (Milos Krasic). It's not like Newcastle built their team with the incentive of CL qualification. Just because we've signed CL players in the past doesn't mean that's the only way to get good players.

&gt; If we are not in the CL at the end of this upcoming season, I predict with relative certainty that at least 3 of the following 4 players will leave: Suarez, Reina, Agger, Lucas.

Three of those four have had the opportunity to leave over the past 3 non-CL seasons already, especially when Benitez left. I agree that Suarez is a concern, but we're currently in contract talks with Agger, and Reina's on a long-term deal and has less incentive to leave now than he did during Hodgson's reign. Suarez is a risk, sure.

And even if any of them leave, none of them have one year left on their deal - we won't sell them cheap, we can get enough money to replace them - *if we scout well*.

&gt; We have an exciting new manager but no exciting new talent for him to work with, and likely not sufficient funds to compensate for our lack of CL football when enticing transfer targets.

Again, the assumption that we need to offer high wages to compensate for a lack of CL football. We're not City or Chelsea, we can't and won't work that way. Also, we *do* still have exciting talent which, having been at the club for a year already, should be more likely to deliver this season. We all accept last year's squad was better than an 8th placed finish - even without new signings we should do better this year.

**tl;dr: If we scout well and look for value in the transfer market (which Rodgers has done successfully in the past), we can assemble CL-quality players without offering high wages. We don't need to compensate for a lack of CL football with wages.**",0,1341020789,null,0,false,0,c57j1cv,t3_vsuuh,t1_c57j1cv,t1_c57d86p,null,1429263591,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

LFC has never had a 'buy up players like Cavani' approach to the transfer market so I dont know why fans get frustrated every transfer window when the club doesn't meet those expectations. We have to be smart, just like any other club outside of the top 2-4 in any league in Europe. Hell, Cavani was bought by and plays for Napoli, and they weren't exactly setting Europe on fire either.
