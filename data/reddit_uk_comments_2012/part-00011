I completely agree - they have both been immense this season and have really made very few defensive errors. I have a great deal of confidence in our CB tandem right now. 

Agger has always been very good going forward in attack and he's continued to get even better. I've been impressed by Skrtel as well; he's looked very composed on the ball and has gone forward far more that I would have expected. 

Between Agger, Skrtel, and Lucas, we have three players who are extremely reliable in defense. Enrique is also showing that he could very well be considered as a consistent and reliable defender, although he has made a few errors (and gives up the ball too often on offense for my taste). Still, Enrique has played quite well. 

Perhaps I'm just overly confident after this great week, but it really feels like this team is just two good players short of being quite formidable. I'd say we need a creative winger and a poacher type striker, plus a healthy Lucas. ",0,1328002256,null,0,true,0,c3meciz,t3_p49af,t1_c3meciz,t1_c3mdtfa,null,1428270140,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

That is achieved by 'mixing' it with a locally-generated signal of the same frequency as the carrier. Hence the need for a local oscillator.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"It wasn't inefficiency that caused the miners strike. The problem was the government and unions agreed to performance based bonuses. However they intentionally screwed up the bonus scheme to split the union. They were paying bonus on weight of coal rather than on energy output.

The Welsh mines were producing lower volumes of high calorific value. The mines in Nottinghamshire were producing vast volumes of mediocre coal.

This led to one set of miners bearing the brunt of spending cuts even though there wasn't anything between the regions in terms of raw energy output per worker. That split the union and inevitably led to new industrial action.

Thatcher beat one half of the industry in strike action and then closed the other half. It was always set up to cause a fight. I dislike Scargill but Thatcher picked a fight there intentionally with an uneven deal and efficiency was an excuse. Scargill is a tosser because he had the opportunity to settle and instead tried to take down the government. He actually had Thatcher beaten right up until the moment he turned it into a political action rather than an industrial action.

That single act is what destroy unionism in the UK. People were fearful already that the TUC ran the country.

I'm not sure by your question whether you want Scottish food, or just good food.  If you like French food, [Cafe Marlayne](http://www.cafemarlayne.com/) is excellent and reasonably priced/

Good Dim Sum can be got at [Saigon Saigon](http://www.saigonrestaurant.co.uk/) or my favourite [Rainbow Arch](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d788399-Reviews-Rainbow_Arch-Edinburgh_Scotland.html) just off Lothian Road.  

Best Japanese is [Tangs Gohan](http://www.tangsgohan.com/) (my Japanese wife backs me on this), although another Japanese friend told me recently that there's one opened near to Jimmy Chungs opposite the theatres off Lothian Rd that is now best in Edinburgh.  Both are very high quality.  Avoid 'Yes Sushi'.

Best Korean is [Shilla](http://www.shilla-edinburgh.com/).  Went recently and was very impressed.

Best Italian is [Amarone](http://www.amaronerestaurant.co.uk/) on St Andrews Sq.

Best Scottish...I really don't know.  Most of the Rose street pubs do a great fish and chips or Steak and Kidney pie in my opinion.  [Hectors](http://www.hectorsstockbridge.co.uk/) in Stockbridge does cheerful service with tasty grub and has a cracking atmosphere

He's a total con man, and the Pope's right hand man too.


TETZEL: 

Are you wondering who I am, or what I am? Is there 
anyone here among you, any small child, any cripple, or 
any sick idiot who hasn't heard of me, and doesn't know 
why I am here? No? Well, speak up then if there is? 
What, no one? Do you all know me then? Do you all 
know who I am? If it's true, it's very good, and just as it 
should be. Just as it should be, and no more than that! 
However, however just in case just in case, mind, 
there is one blind, maimed midget among you today 
who can't hear, I will open his ears and wash them out 
with sacred soap for him! And, as for the rest of you. I 
know I can rely on you all to listen patiently while I in 
struct him. Is that right? Can I go on? I'm asking you, is 
that right, can I go on? I say ""can I go on""? 

(Pause) 

Thank you. And what is there to tell this blind, maimed 
midget who's down there somewhere among you? No, 
don't look round for him, you'll only scare him and then 
he'll lose his one great chance, and it's not likely to come 
again, or if it does come, maybe it'll be too late. Well, 
what's the good news on this bright day? What's the in 
formation you want? It's this! Who is this friar with his 
red cross? Who sent him, and what's he here for? Don't 
try to work it out for yourself because I'm going to tell 
you now, this very minute. I am John Tetzel, Dominican, 
inquisitor, sub-commissioner to the Archbishop of Mainz, 
and what I bring you is indulgences. Indulgences made 
possible by the red blood of Jesus Christ, and the red 
cross you see standing up here behind me is the standard 
of those who carry them. Look at it! Go on, look at it! 
What else do you see hanging from the red cross? Well, 
what do they look like? Why, it's the arms of his holi 
ness, because why? Because it's him who sent me here. 
Yes, my friend, the Pope himself has sent me with in 
dulgences for you! Fine, you say, but what are indul 
gences? And what are they to me? What are indulgences? 
They're only the most precious and noble of Gods gifts to 
men, that's all they are! Before God, I tell you I wouldn't 
swap my privilege at this moment with that of St. Peter 
in Heaven because I've already saved more souls with 
my indulgences than he could ever have done with all his 
sermons. You think that's bragging, do you? Well, listen 
a little more carefully, my friend, because this concerns 
youl Just look at it this way. For every mortal sin you 
commit, the Church says that after confession and con 
trition, you've got to do penance either in this life or in 
purgatory for seven years. Seven years! Right? Are you 
with me? Good. Now then, how many mortal sins are 
committed by you by you in a single day? Just think 
for one moment: in one single day of your life. Do you 
know the answer? Oh, not so much as one a day. Very 
well then, how many in a month? How many in six 
months? How many in a year? And how many in a whole 
lifetime? Yes, you needn't shuffle your feet it doesn't 
bear thinking about, does it? You couldn't even add up 
all those years without a merchant's clerk to do it for 
you! Try and add up all the years of torment piling up! 
What about it? And isn't there anything you can do 
about this terrible situation you're in? Do you really 
want to know? Yes! There is something, and that some 
thing I have here with me now up here, letters, letters of 
indulgence. Hold up the letters so that everyone can see 
them. Is there anyone so small he can't see? Look at 
them, all properly sealed, an indulgence in every en 
velope, and one of them can be yours today, now, before 
it's too late! Come on, come up as close as you like, you 
won't squash me so easily. Take a good look. There isn't 
any one sin so big that one of these letters can't remit it. 
I challenge any one here, any member of this audience, 
to present me with a sin, anything, any kind of a sin, I 
don't care what it is, that I can't settle for him with 
one of these precious little envelopes. Why, if any one 
had ever offered violence to the blessed Virgin Mazy, 
Mother of God, if he'd only pay up as long as he paid 
up all he could he'd find himself forgiven. You think 
I'm exaggerating? You do, do you? Well, I'm authorized 
to go even further than that. Not only am I empowered 
to give you these letters of pardon for the sins you've al 
ready committed, I can give you pardon for those sins 
-you haven't even committed (pause . . . then slowly) 
but, which, however you intend to commit! But, you 
ask and it's a fair question but, you ask, why is our 
Holy Lord prepared to distribute such a rich grace to 
me? The answer, my friends, is all too simple. It's so 
that we can restore the ruined church of St. Peter and 
St. Paul in Rome! So that it won't have its equal any 
where in the world. This great church contains the bodies 
not only of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, but of a 
hundred thousand martyrs and no less than forty-six 
popes! To say nothing of the relics like St Veronica's 
handkerchief, the burning bush of Moses and the very 
rope with which Judas Iscariot hanged himself! But, alas,
this fine old building is threatened with destruction, and 
all these things with it, if a sufficient restoration fund 
isn't raised, and raised soon. (With passionate irony) . . . 
Will anyone dare to say that the cause is not a good 
one? (Pause.) . . . Very well, and won't you, for as little 
as one quarter of a florin, my friend, buy yourself one of 
these letters, so that in the hour of death, the gate 
through which sinners enter the world of torment shall 
be closed against you, and the gate leading to the joy of 
paradise be flung open for you? And, remember this, 
these letters aren't just for the living but for the dead 
too. There can't be one amongst you who hasn't at least 
one dear one who has departed and to who knows 
what? Why, these letters are for them too. It isn't even 
necessary to repent. So don't hold back, come forward, 
think of your dear ones, think of yourselves! For twelve 
groats, or whatever it is we think you can afford, you 
can rescue your father from agony and yourself from 
certain disaster. And if you only have the coat on your 
back to call your own, then strip it off, strip it off now so 
that you too can obtain grace. For remember: As soon 
as your money rattles in the box and the cash bell rings, 
the soul flies out of purgatory and sings! So, come on 
then. Get your money out! What is it then, have your 
wits flown away with your faith? Listen then, soon, I 
shall take down the cross, shut the gates of heaven, and 
put out the brightness of this sun of grace that shines on 
you here today. 

(He flings a large coin into the open strong box, 

where it rattles furiously.) 

The Lord our God reigns no longer. He has resigned all 
power to the Pope. In the name of the Father, and of the 
Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. 

(The sound of coins clattering like rain into a great 

coffer as the light fades.)

Brauhaus is the best for beer, owner's very knowledgeable and they have a great selection. He also run's Nina's Mini Market round the corner which is the best off licence in Edinburgh. One of my favourites but always gets busy.

There's also Brewdog which again has a great selection - bottles are way to expensive but they do great beers on tap. Different atmosphere, they're more ""hipster"" if I could call it that, though I'm sure they don't like being pigeonholed...But really knowledgeable staff again, always willing to offer advice.

My favourite two are probably the Bow Bar or Bennets, more traditional and do nice Real Ales but still have an atmosphere. Also the Earl of Marchmont's good if you happen to be in Marchmont, but it's tiny and busy. And Cloisters and the Blue Blazer are good for traditional ales as well but we can never get a seat when we go in...
The Holyrood 9A is good too, nice selection of beers but has more of an after-work, professional vibe.

I also recommend Lebowskis on a Saturday, they have a good folk band on then, and about 20 types of White Russians.

For cocktail bars, the best is by far Bramble, not that unreasonably priced either for what you get. Dragonfly is also good, even if it doesn't look it from the outside, and the Cuckoo's nest used to be one of my regulars, when it did good cocktails for half the price of the others, but it's got a wee bit more expensive now.

So that's a pretty comprehensive overview of my drinking life...

And like those players, Tom picks his spots to be more incisive. I know with this type of video there is less context, but he played some part in basically every chance we created in this match. I almost made a separate video with just the moves he started to create chances, and I still might. I just didn't want a 7 minute compilation video. 

He only tried 3 of those cross-field lofted ""Hollywood"" balls the entire game. They all failed, but only one of them was his fault. That's honestly how it should be. None of this Charlie Adam spraying the ball 60 yards every other time he gets the damn ball nonsense. 

My favorite part about this performance is how much he improved over the course of the game. Started a little shaky with a few heavy touches and misplaced passes (though the little dink for Pav's first chance was classy as fuck) but ended with a cheeky backheel to Modric.

It's a three or four tiered system of quality. He made me a crown for mates rates and I had it fitted properly. It also took the dentist at least twice as long to fit which told me something. 

Saying that I had a mountain bike accident and lost all my front teeth about 15 years ago top and bottom and shattered my jaw so I have spent long enough in a dentist chair and need to take care.

When I watch ITV1 and Channel 4, its obvious that the advertisements have greater budgets than most of the shows. In fact I only tend to watch football on ITV these days.

What really annoys me is how the British press takes every opportunity to scandalise the BBC as some sort of left wing conspiracy whenever, in fact, the BBC editorial guidelines are much more robust than all of Murdoch's (and most other daily) papers put together. Imagine how the BBC would have been dealt with if they had hacked someone's voicemail.

I don't think the BBC is perfect, but I still think its very good. The NI news is cringeworthy, usually five minutes of news over the half hour but some of the mainstream shows are of the highest quality in the world. I also believe there is a large element of consultancy and committee thinking throughout the BBC which wastes vasts amounts of money but this is a problem it has in common with all publicly funded bodies these days (i.e. most government departments).

When the 11th lands on the Fields of Trenzalore, the question (Doctor Who?) is asked because he is faced with another version of himself.  

Now assume the 8th Doctor is the one who placed Gallifrey, the Time Lords and all of the Daleks in the Time Lock with the Moment.  Given this premise, imagine the 8th Doctor has created a paradox, intentionally, where he continues to exist but wipes out the memory of his act so his regenerations can continue.  

He does this with the sole intention of using the future Doctors to find any remaining Daleks (who avoided the Time Lock) and wiping them out.  

Once complete, the 8th Doctor's plan is to ensure that no one can mess with the time stream again by removing the Tardis (blowing it up) and the Doctor (falling on the Fields of Trenzalore) from the universe.

What I do hate is how the media portrays things as English when they choose, and British when they choose. ""The UK riots"" for example. No, they were riots that happned in England. Yet whenever British people in England do something good, they automatically become English again. The same, yet opposite can be said in Scotland. How many times we've heard Andy Murray labelled a Brit, yet whenever we do something wrong, we are Scottish again. Queen Elizabeth the 2nd. Was there ever a Queen Elizabeth the 1st? Of England yes, but not of Britain.

That is NOT why I want independence for Scotland though. Its merely an annoyance. What sickens me the most is that the opinions of parliaments across the border is so drastically different to ours. We are ruled by Tories, Scotland didn't vote for Tories, England did. The SNP seemed to be portrayed in the media as tyrants. No, we voted for them, they won the election. Salmond cannot be compared to Mugabe, as the BBC seem so fond of doing. Scots also pay a TV licence, and do not enjoy being portrayed as ""Social Junkies"", scrounging off the English. We dont enjoy having un-elected peers. We dont enjoy Prime-Ministers that are war hungry. We dont enjoy politicians who lie, have no morals, and are out to make as much money as they can, whilst cutting benefits and services to the most needy, putting thousands of children into povery when they themselves have never seen an hour of poverty or hardship in their snobbish lives. 

I'll be glad when we get our independence, and please trust me when I say I really will pity the English that we left behind, stuck with that definition-of-arsehole David Cameron as a ruler.

true,TheScarletPimpernel,null,null,"Just took my match analysis from my LFC forum for you lot (7 is average):

Reina - 7. Had nothing to do. Whatsoever.

Johnson - 6. Some good attacking and defending marred by a number of errors.
Skrtel - 7.5. Rock.
Agger - 8. Rock some more.
Enrique - 8.5. Superlative tonight.

Adam - 7. Passing was there, 10th and 11th assists of the season, but his tackling was again embarrassing.
Spearing - 9 MotM. Great performance from Speo. I counted one mistake all game.
Hendo - 6.5. Hustled, bustled, played some good football. Not not a great deal of impact overall.

Dirk - 9. Brilliant performance from the Diggler, put his all into everything, played some tremendous football and scored his both league goal (finally). Lets hope he can kick on again like the back end of last season. Showed the rest of the team how to get the best out of the big lad.
Carroll - 9 MotM. Much improved from AC, bullied the Wolves defense into submission, should have had numerous assists but for poor support and finally got another goal. A good way to celebrate your club birthday.
Bellaz - 8.5. Slightly down on his previous performances, but then what else did we expect? Scored, should have assisted, very very good work.

Subs:
Carra - N/A. Barely touched the ball after coming on.

The ref had to give the first and only yellow of the game as the Wigan player kicked the ball away after Parker had been awarded a free kick at the end.

Just like all the gypsy shows popping up, it's there purely for viewers to judge and ridicule the people involved while feeling better about themselves. Although strangely this program seems to have the opposite effect in that it makes people feel worse for trying to earn a living when we could get it just as handy on the brew.

Don't get me wrong, I'm in no way defending the lazy gits that just want to live on government hand outs their whole life. I have a relative that gets his rent paid for him plus whatever the going rate the dole is now, and yet he still pesters his elderly parents scrounging money/food off them because he's pissed/smoked his dole money as soon as he gets it. The people are only part of the problem, the other problem is the welfare system we have at the minute, if it wasn't the way it is, these people wouldn't be able to abuse it like this.

I'm pissed that the licence fee is being wasted on trash like this. How about making an actual documentary about the hardships of living on an estate, about people that actually want to make something of themselves but are finding it hard to because of the state of the economy, and not something that basically amounts to ""Hurrrr, all council estate people are dumb and lazy lol"". I suppose with the BBC pumping out quality programming like ""Snog, Marry, Avoid"" and ""Young, Dumb and Living off Mum"" I should have known what I was letting myself in for.

My advice, don't watch it, maybe if the viewing figures drop low enough they won't make a second series.

Technically they covered that in ""End of Time"" but technically they also introduced that woman that they've never come back to, so I don't know. I still say he could unlock the Time Lords and stop all this moping about being the ""last of the Time Lords.""

And I assume when you talk about destroying the TARDIS you mean the (still unexplained) explosion that destroyed all time that the Doctor rebooted the universe to prevent? Or does he destroy the TARDIS another time?

My take? The question is proof that Doctor Who is a TV show. Answering it will shatter the 4th wall and plunge the Doctor Who universe into mundanity.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Nothing is canonically essential but...

First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.",0,1328053925,null,0,false,0,c3mmjrq,t3_p4zdc,t1_c3mmjrq,t3_p4zdc,null,1428274136,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

* Johnson 6.5 - Good movement forward 
* Skrtel 6.5 - Sturdy but allowed some balls through
* Agger 7 - Impermeable and stuck to defensive duties
* Enrique 7.5 - Good movement forward and defended well after a tough week
* Adam 7 - Sloppy but provided some excellent service
* Spearing 8.5 - Ran the midfield, defended brilliantly and made himself available. **MOTM**
* Henderson 7 - Moved the play forward well
* Kuyt 8 - Played fluently, looked dangerous, linked up play and scored a good goal
* Bellamy 8 - Dynamic, assertive and ran at defenders earning a deserved goal
* Carroll 8 - Dominated in the air, scored his first goal of the year.

* Carragher 6 - Blended in
* Shelvey 6.5 - Looked better than the Wolves midfield.
* Aurelio 6 - Didn't get injured

Ultimately, we dominated. Wolves looked dangerous at times but that can be expected at Molineux having just played the Manchester clubs. Football looked more fluid, less wasteful. There was more penetration and the finishing was much more clinical. No one lost concentration either. 8/10 performance.
