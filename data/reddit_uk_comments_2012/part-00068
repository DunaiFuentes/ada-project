There is nothing anywhere on that sidebar that would indicate that this subreddit is only for fans who are one hundred percent up to date with a show. In fact there are plenty of other subs that do a great job of keeping things friendly to fresh new faces. Curious individuals looking to share something with you. 

Meaningful conversation? The people who aren't caught up couldn't have that conversation with you anyway. So why not warn them? Their existence doesn't stop you from having that conversation, so why should your conversation stop them from being here? All it take is a few simple keystrokes and both of you can coexist. 

Again though, what gives you the right to dictate to someone if they are worthy to enjoy a show or not? Say they don't enjoy something as much because the suspense has been taken out of it. Why is that wrong? They may still enjoy it just a little less than they potentially would have, but what gives you the right to say they don't deserve to enjoy it at all? What does it matter that you and some others have already seen it eight months ago? They didn't, that doesn't hurt you. 

I'm not asking for everyone to comb through every post and make sure there aren't any spoilers. I'm asking you to. Every person can make their own individual choice in the matter.

If you truly don't care about a minority out there then that is your choice. I just hope that you take a minute to understand and accept that fact.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"&gt; I don't thinl anyone one will be able to truly say whether he is ""the right man"" or whether he is doing a good job until at least Christmas.

So 6 months is enough to know whether Rodgers is the right man for the job, but Kenny should have been given all 3 years of his contract to determine if he is doing a good job?

In case you misunderstand, I don't imply that Kenny should have left. I believe that all managers should be given a minimum of 2 years in order to really make their mark on the club. There are, of course, extreme cases, like when the manager alienates the players or insults the fans. These, however, are on a case-by-case basis, managers in general should still be given far longer than 6 months to show their real mettle.

 This is especially true for Liverpool, because Rodgers has to address a huge inbalance. The common perception, whether in the media or among the fans, is that Liverpool needs to be challenging for Top 4, if not the title. Our players, however, have grossly performed under-expectations. This might be down to a confidence and luck issue, or plain down to lack of ability. Everybody can say (and I agree) that Henderson has loads of potential, but if he never utilises it, he will never be considered good, or at least good enough. 

Rodgers has to deal with a squad that has several items of baggage:

1. He will have to integrate Gerrard into his playing style, because the fans will riot if Gerrard is dropped. 

2. He will have to deal with fringe players who are on substantial wages like Joe Cole, Aquilani and Maxi Rodriguez. 

3. He will have to rejuvenate the confidence of our new signings like Downing, Henderson, Carroll and Adam, because we are unlikely to get offers for them. 

4. He will have to deal with youngsters like Shelvey, Spearing, Sterling, Robinson and Flanagan, making a decision on whether to keep them on the bench or put them out on loan. 

5. He needs to fill up some gaping holes in the squad, backups for positions such as the wings, defensive midfield and left-back. 

Our squad has been in a disarray for a while, and Dalglish did little to nothing in remedying it. Buck faces a major challenge and the fans need to withhold judgement until after a season or two. Unless, of course, he insults the fans, asks Agger to hoof the ball, and sucks up to Fergie. Then we sack him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The establishment's power is derived from being able to mediate every financial transaction. It can decide when, where, how and who gets to create money. People don't want to fund war, but taxation makes all complicit in the ills of the corporate-state, yet those that benefit the most have access to tax havens. I see the corporation and the monarchy as tax havens, and it is no surprise that the latter is the head of ""Jersey, Guernsey, The Isle of Man, Bermuda, Cayman, The British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, and of course, The City of London"". (To make clear I see little distinction between monarchies and corporations, the latter consciously apes the previous.)

Taxes have always been about extracting wealth, and normal citizens pay around 50% of their income to taxes (20% income + 20% VAT + fuel + Council Tax, and so on). It has the effect where the 1000£ I might choose to circulate in the local economy quickly disappears and choosing the conservative 40% rate, after the 6th transaction the state has taken all but 50£. If we compare this to the monarchy who's income is guaranteed, protected from inheritance and (for some members) income tax. The same goes for the corporation in the obvious ways (they never die, pay 25% business tax, etc), but there is one subtle manner never discussed. If we see a corporation as individuals trading with each other, one might share secretarial skills with management for example. Normally a trade in services or goods would be taxed, so it could be argued the corporation acts like one large black market. There is a certain sovereignty about the construct, especially for multinationals. If we self employ all those working in companies that would mean 20% or greater tax contributions for those people perhaps.

Those subjected to only be able to trade in official coinage can never have sovereignty themselves, and if you look to the expansionist wars in the middle east it doesn't take long to find a geographical protection or expansion of currency domains. A good example would be ~2001 where Saddam wanted to sell oil priced in Euros, and we know what happened a few years later. (I'm thinking whether or not  some in the FED are laughing as they look at the Greek situation.) The same goes for Libya when Gaddafi started getting serious about a new African currency backed by gold.

The 3 finalists are Setia, Bradman and Chelsea FC. Bradman's plan is backed by South African financiers and essentially would turn the site into a car park. Not much support for that, obviously

Setia are a Malaysian consortium and want to turn it all into flats and rental income properties. They are the top bidders, beating our bid by some £60m. However, a lot of controversy exists at the moment because many feel that Setia already has approval to demolish the power station. By knocking it down, you save £75m in restoration money and free up around 35-50% of the land on the site, meaning huge gains on the bottom line profit. This 'understanding' between the council and Setia would be a valid explanation for how they overshot our bid so massively, as we have to factor in the costs of restoring the power station and utilising it as part of our development

Contrary to what some would say, Chelsea are not out of it yet. There is a strong support for our bid from a large part of the council and we tick every single box on the wishlist, we are in essence the dream ticket. However, first option goes to the banks and the administrators who hold the debt related to the power station site, and since their motivations are purely based on financials, the Setia bid is currently preferred to ours

This site has been rattling around for 30 years now though, every development bid has fallen flat, even in the heady development days of the early-mid 00s. With a bit of luck (we've had some this season) and some strategic positioning, it could yet be ours

Say No have been a spanner in the works. By not getting on board they are essentially forcing Roman to finance a purchase of a new stadium before he knows if he can definitely sell Stamford Bridge to finance the new deal. It certainly hasn't helped. I think at the next vote, with the concrete proposals, architectural renderings and the 3 mile rule being adhered to, the club would certainly get the 75% needed

It's arguing that Rose was something bright in his life and all the ""baggage"" of his past is something bad. I dislike it: even the romantic subplot as it was in the show was much more subtle than this. I don't mind the Doctor and River together: she's partially a Time Lord and very much his equal.

The way the whole thing ends with the Doctor's clone going with Rose is just creepy and disturbing and puts a bad taste in my mouth about the whole thing. It reads like a bad wish-fufillment fanfiction and not a fifty year old science fiction franchise.

EDIT - If it weren't for Rose's picture, I could stomach this a little more I think. Ten was the one that was the most...unconnected to his past. He actively tried to hide from it. You can see that in the conversation he has with his Fifth incarnation and how he hated trying to be all ""grumpy and important"".

It's hard to comprehend how they must have felt as 12 year old boys often going into battle in some of the bloodiest and most harrowing encounters in the age of sail. A ship of the line going into battle would have been just about the most frightening thing you can possibly imagine. You're heading into battle very slowly, giving plenty of time to think about how the fuck you got yourself into this situation and that there's absolutely no way out of it. You may have heard about the dangers of sea battles, but nothing could prepare you for what was about to unfold. Often the tactic was to hold fire until you're at point blank range to the enemy, so that your broadsides have full effect. The most effective way to do this is to pass the enemy ship at the right-angle and pass beneath its stern. Your cannons then fire as they come up to the stern, each in their turn. This sends cannon balls flying down the length of the ship, bouncing off floors, smashing columns and sending splinters flying in every direction (splinters caused more mortal wounds than any other factor in sea battles). It was carnage, the floors slippery with blood, the deafening noise of cannons, shouting, screaming, the acrid smoke, and the constant fear of imminent death.

Democracy, insofar as it could mean people having tangible influence over how their societies are run, can't exist if the majority (or even a minority, were that the case) live under the yoke of oppression. 

It seems to me that if people don't want to recognise they are serfs, it's a tough idea to put across. This is the trick, right? Instead of blatant autocracy, be subtle and they won't know what's up. 

As to money or currency, I like the idea of negative interest, causing money to lose value, forcing people to circulate it and stimulate activity. Also, why not allow anyone to issue a money to suit whatever purpose? As long as society can restrict the accumulation of excessive wealth and power, the tools we use to transact shouldn't matter too much. We might even get wise and learn to transact for the fun of it without too much care for accounting. 

As to redistribution and downsizing the population - huzzah. People often seem to react to suggestions we need to reduce population as if one was suggesting a massacre but limiting birthrates for a generation or two would straighten things out nice and easy. I seem to recall reading that even two offspring per nuclear unit of quasi-autonomous familial bonding would result in a net reduction in population fairly quickly. 

If only the cultural spells could be altered, I am sure there are many many people who secretly wish to forgo breeding and would be relieved to be free of the ancient myths about breeding making one's life purposeful and complete.

As a British basketball player it comes down to one thing; coverage.

When I took up the sport it was at a time when Channel 4 had absolutely unparalleled TV coverage of the NBA. They had several shows hosted by the same core group of guys who actually knew the game and were passionate about it (for example Slam magazine writer and editor Scoop Jackson) on a Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. You could actually keep up with the NBA during realistic waking hours rather than now having to have already shelled out up to £40 a month on a Sky subscription only to have to wait until 2am to watch a game.

In the late 90's, along with this increased exposure, basketball in the UK really took off. Add to that the launching of the National Lottery, we saw a lot of basketball nets erected due to Lottery money. 

The community is small but most of the guys I grew up playing with still play to this day and some have gone one to be successful (I used to train with Luol Deng and his brother Ajou at Brixton).

It has nothing to do with scoring systems or similarities to children's games. Simply the coverage passed from Channel 4, where it was excellent, to ITV, where it was presented by Beverly Turner (famous for being related to famous athletes rather than being one herself) and Derek Redmond, a bloody 400m sprinter, both of whom had no clue about the game. The coverage was presented as if people were educationally challenged. I stopped watching when one Saturday they decided to dedicate 30 minutes to explain what a layup was and how many points you score from various parts of the court. It was insulting frankly.

Then there was the British game itself. I tried man, but the quality was poor. That we could have put up with as British players ourselves part of this small community, but when the best teams in England decided that second rate American players should fill the league instead of actually talented British players I gave up watching that too as did a lot of people I know.

The sport would take off, as it almost did, if it was handled well but it just isn't and kids are not exposed to it.

&gt; Negative interest

which is what taxation tries to achieve in some aspects, but fails miserably. I have heard of annual clay tokens as a representation of grain storage being used for currency in the middle ages, and each year they were devalued because of natural forces like spoilage or storage costs. It just makes sense, we can't in a year produce all the food a society will need for 10. The work done today should reflect the money available today, and it is foolish to stretch that across decades, or pull in future earnings into the present.

What does that sound like? To me I immediately think of entropy which is severely lacking in the monetary system. Highly ordered organisations require much effort in the physical world, but in finance the more money you have the easier it is to protect and attract more. I'm am not surprised that we suffer economic black holes every so often.

The two offsprings is correct because there will always be a percentage who die before becoming parents; car crashes, disease, or even sterility. We even have natural bio-social mechanisms for population control which would happen here, Germany and Japan if immigration wasn't an issue. Organisms naturally have evolved to react to external resource pressures, thinking the other way round death is a massive aphrodisiac. War seems to be the goto move for the state to limit population size, but of course you then get the baby boomers.

Breeding: well it depends what you see as your next generation, but for me 'breeding' is all about transferring wealth across generations so it is incredibly important, and I mean that in the context of from-the-beginning-of-time rather than avoiding inheritance tax.

If you think about human ethnicity across the planet on a human evolutionary scale, then frankly, white people are a bit of a modern aberration.

These are all products I love and have bought many times, all from value ranges unless otherwise stated:

&gt;1kg Frozen Chicken Breast - Morrisons or Asda - £4

Cheaper than fresh and just as good

&gt;1kg Frozen Cauliflower - All, Cheapest at Morrisons (I believe) ~90p
&gt;1kg Frozen Broccoli - All, ~£1

Never goes wrong

&gt;670g Cooking Bacon - Sainsburys 99p

Amazing. Basically my religion. Varies greatly, usually closer to 1kg in weight, some packs are rashers, some big cuts I call steakon

&gt;340g Peanut butter - All  ~85p

I have tried every value range peanut butter and they are all much the same, except Sainsbury's which is quite runny but has 2/3 less carbs.

&gt;400g can Chopped Tomatoes - all - ~35p

These come in cans or cartons depending where you shop. Excellent value. Nothing wrong with them at all!

&gt;2ltr sparkling water - all - ~17p

I combine this with sugar-free cordial and as a result don't buy soft drinks anymore.

&gt;500ml Curry Sauce - all - ~19p

Pretty decent mild curry sauce, fluctuates between 9p and 35p almost weekly.

&gt;Powdered Mashed Potato - all - ~45p

All supermarkets have their own size and price, but the product is fine. Food snobs will lambaste you, but nutrition-wise is the same as ""real"" potatoes and these store conveniently.

&gt;125g(?) Assorted Toffees - all - ~20p 

Great hard dairy toffee for very little money and I'd say comparable to Thorntons hammer toffee.

I'm sure there are more as I live almost exclusively on Dharma-Initiative-esque value range products. Will edit my post as I remember others.


EDIT:
Okay, I've had a look through my larder and found another few!

&gt;Custard powder! All supermarkets ~9p

No need to add sugar or milk or anything, just some boiling water and you're laughing.

&gt;Sage and Onion Stuffing - Sainsbury's - 15p

Great dried stuffing that doesn't go wrong, really good to store and tastes pretty great with pork or chicken around it!

&gt;100g Milk/Dark/White Chocolate - All markets - ~35p

Doesn't go wrong. Typical British chocolate, so 60% is sugar. Sainsbury's Milk Chocolate tastes exactly like the chocolate contingent of Cadbury Creme Eggs.

&gt;500g Pasta - All - ~39p

While this Pasta is hardly spectacular (Goes from Al Dente to slush with no nice middleground when cooked normally) I liked to keep a store in for Pasta Bakes, as it works well for the purpose and it's always a shame to waste good brand-name Pasta in a bake.

&gt;345g (drained weight) Canned Potatoes - All - ~30p

I know, I know, sounds dodgy right? Truth is these are great to have in your stores and best thought of not as potatoes but as something else in their own right. They have a satisfying very-slightly-waxy texture and are great side with butter.

&gt;Non-value-range-but-still-cheap honourable mention: TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein) - Best bought from Health Food shops rather than supermarkets. I got 15kg for ~£20 at ""Real Foods"" in Edinburgh.

A few weeks ago I was on a night out when something kicked off, so I went over to a copper for help. I'd had a few drinks and put my hand on his shoulder asking for him to come over. He was a real aggressive piece of work, and threatened to arrest me for assault. (!)

Couldn't believe how ridiculous a threat that was so I swore at him in frustration, he promptly arrested me and I was taken to the station and thrown in a cell for the night. I was denied a phone call to let my girlfriend know what had happened, so she spent all night up worrying.

It's the first time I have ever been in any trouble with the police and I am in my twenties. I slept, and the next morning the sergeant went through my options with me, having breached Section 5 of the Public Order Act (using language likely to harass, alarm or distress). I chose to take an £80 fixed penalty notice rather than a police caution and criminal record. Note that an FPN is not an admission of guilt and payment exempts you from ever being charged of the crime. While the sergeant disappeared to process my FPN and therefore my innocence (you can break the law if you can afford to, I guess), I was taken to a room where they took all of my finger prints, hand prints, and DNA swabs from both cheeks. I asked the worker how long they would be retained for and she straight up didn't know.

There is absolutely NO good reason for them to have my DNA. Not one.

I was asked if I would like anyone to be informed of my arrest and if I would like a solicitor about 5 minutes before I was released back on to the street.

Yes, exactly. I believe this should be *very* much higher - like 100%.

She would therefore be in the position of either approving the premiership of someone who will abolish her position and her powers, or denying the premiership to someone who has been correctly elected for her own self-interest. And, with the way our constitution is arranged, if the Queen is abolished, then theoretically Parliament loses all of its power because power flows downwards from the monarch.

Somebody has just posted you a link of the BBC reporting on just this.  You're ignoring it because it doesn't fit with your narrative.

&gt;The BBC has to cater for all so they throw in scraps of perhaps decent journalism while they are more interested in promoting inconsequential events or worse, meta-events like the jubilee. The same goes for their Dancing on Ice, Eastenders and all that crap.

This is like somebody walking into the children's section of the local library and announcing the library is crap because they can't find anything they want and all the books have pictures in them.  If you don't like news crammed into short slots or Dancing on Ice then watch Newsnight, BBC Parliament, HardTalk, listen to BBC Radio 4.  Get out of the damn kiddie section.

&gt;An excellent example is the BBC never forgetting to interleave reference to 'rapist' Assange for anything Wikileaks,

By excellent you mean rather poor.  Assange is the face of Wikileaks, Assange made it that way himself.  The BBC doesn't say he is a rapist, rather they report and put it into context when talking about his extradition that it is in connection with rape charges; which it is. That's not to imply any guilt. You're just reading into that.

You're just a 'Stick it to da man'-Stan and a bit like Wolfy Smith you see the man everywhere and with everything that doesn't see the world through your own narrow slit.

If you don't like Dancing on Ice and you want your news more in depth then don't watch Dancing on Ice and tune into the Today Programme between 6 and 9.

If you knew anything about me, you would know that I've never censored my own opinions or tried to karmawhore on this subreddit. In fact, I even called out some American supporters last season who used YNWA as an excuse to behave as if the club was beyond criticism. Some, not all, are naive to English culture and our ability to perpetually moan, even when things are going well. I don't particularly mind that sort of mentality, but it did wind me up when I was accused of not being a ""real"" supporter, given that I grew up 3 miles from Anfield and have supported this club longer than most in this subreddit have been alive.

Despite that, it would be the height of arrogance for me to dismiss the experience of any LFC supporter, anywhere. I've had the pleasure of watching matches with supporters in Kenya, Seattle, Mumbai, Zurich, Gibraltar, and Bogota. Sometimes their knowledge of the club's history was not as deep as someone who grew up in the shadow of the stadium. Sometimes they had unrealistic views of the abilities of players that came from their home nation. But never, not once, could I say that their enthusiasm was anything less than astonishing and refreshing, **especially** given their geographical separation from the club.

&gt; Do you actually have any better insults?

I just feel bad for you. Given that LFC's fanbase exists a hundred fold (at least) beyond the confines of it's stadium, you are severely limiting yourself and your experience in supporting this club. 

You are a relic, it seems, and a dangerous one at that. Despite it's humble roots, this club has become a global icon.  Your inability to embrace that, to go so far as to dismiss the experience of others, is not in line with the spirit of the club or it's ambitions. Even though we have had an international profile for decades, it disappoints me to hear that fans like yourself still exist. Inevitably, those like you will die out over time and we can move forward.

'The Work Experience programme is a voluntary scheme for people between 16 and 24 who have been unemployed for more than three months, but less than nine.

Jobseekers who take part have an unpaid work placement for two to eight weeks, working 25 to 30 hours each week. They continue to receive jobseeker's allowance throughout, and may get a contribution towards travel or childcare costs.

However, anyone who cuts their placement short after more than one week will have their benefits stopped for two weeks.

              compound in North Waziristan""

             ""militants still frequently attack security forces and 
              civilians.""

First 3 articles.  In the first 2 it is on context to what somebody else says, not what the BBC themselves were saying, and in the third it was with respect to people actively involved in attacks on security forces and civilians.  The militant definition is a US Obama administration thing.  Not a BBC thing.  The problem here is you're not processing information correctly and reading things that aren't there.

As for them not bothering to verify their sources, they actually said on their own site, on their own image, that they had not been able to confirm the source.  That's a good thing for a news company to do.  It shows transparency.

         ""We were aware of this image being widely circulated 
          on the internet in the early hours following the most 
          recent atrocities in Syria. We used it with a clear 
          disclaimer saying it could not be independently verified. 
          Efforts were made overnight to track down the original 
          source of the image and when it was established the 
          picture was inaccurate we removed it immediately.”

                                      - BBC Spokesperson

The only problem there is they probably should have waited until they knew one way or the other before putting an image up on their website - but they did put it up with a disclaimer whilst they checked.  These things will happen from time to time.  I once had to email the Guardian because they'd [shock-horror] used a picture of Rafsanjani in a story about former Iranian President Khatami and it took then a whole hour to take it down!

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Seems like most people have covered it, but I'm just going to give you the whole enchilada. Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year.

It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1338914093,null,0,false,0,c4wlg3f,t3_um018,t1_c4wlg3f,t3_um018,null,1429073911,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I like the idea of multiple currencies so I'm not shitting on bitcoin because it fails to provide 'that utopian solution'. (One thing to say is bitcoin is more about sending other currencies anonymously.) However, it is literally mining digital gold, so we have the same old problems:

* an advantage to those with the most powerful 'mines', 
* young people (and new entrants) are pushed to the economic periphery for no good reason,
* like gold it will work on an economics of scarcity (hoarding, monopolisation, and other types of circulatory issues will probably emerge),
* it will likely encourage a two tier capitalist/worker relationship,
* if we want a safe store of wealth, it can corrupted by currency speculation, and other forces of the 'invisible hand'.

Most important though is how bitcoin fails as a metaphor in not adequately convey what it means to have money. It doesn't make explicit or implicit the fact that it is all about a social contract based on nothing but trust and a formal representation for the debt/credit relationship.

Having said that it is really good regarding anonymity, but because of that benefit attracting various nefarious activities and the general technophobia of the wider population, I can't see it gaining mainstream traction. It could be a good currency for some in times of crisis, or say, when protestors cannot trust banks. Going back to multiple currencies it might be a good thing to have currencies with a restricted scope. Bitcoin might be the currency of the digital economy, why not have Foodcoin, BuildingCoin, i dunno, Oilcoin?

A Living Sacrifice

12  I appeal to you therefore, brothers,[a] by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.[b] 2  Do not be conformed to this world,[c] but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.[d]

Gifts of Grace

3 For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgement, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. 4 For as in one body we have many members,[e] and the members do not all have the same function, 5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. 6  Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; 7 if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; 8 the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads,[f] with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.

Marks of the True Christian

9  Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. 10  Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honour. 11 Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit,[g] serve the Lord. 12  Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. 13  Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.

14  Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. 15  Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. 16  Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.[h] Never be wise in your own sight. 17  Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honourable in the sight of all. 18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.",0,1338914971,null,0,false,0,c4wlnfb,t3_uma1c,t1_c4wlnfb,t3_uma1c,null,1429074004,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There's a difference between dismissing the experience of the LFC supporter, and being realistic as to the actual concrete contribution that they make. It seems as if you found it apt to assume that I have, in some way, stated that a ""global"" fan is not a real fan, even though I have never said that and even stated very clearly in a different reply (though same thread) that LFC fans are real fans no matter where they are. 

What **you** fail to realise, is that there is no actual tangible way to properly identify a Liverpool fan. Anybody could claim to be a Liverpool fan, and all there is no way of defining whether or not this person is a fan. You watched a football match with someone from Seattle? What's there to stop that person from cheering on Manchester United the next week, Chelsea the week after? Nothing. In the end, when people claim to be a fan of a club, it is taken on faith, and nothing more. 

To that end, then, any fan is a fan, because there isn't anyway to determine if they are lying or not. What can be determined, however, is the actual contribution of the fan. The scousers who spend thousands of pounds every year watching the Reds play at Anfield have actual direct contribution to the club. How much actual direct contribution do the fans in Jakarta, or Harbin Bay, or Mexico City make? 

Notice I said the Anfield attendee is **more** of a fan. I never said the guy sitting in a pub in Bloemfontein is not a real fan, just that the person is Anfield has something that the global fan is unable to surpass. With all things considered on the individual level, losing a match-going fan will cost the club about £50 per game, losing an international fan costs the club nothing. 

Finally, your assumption ( and I guess the assumption of most people who downvoted), is that I spoke from the viewpoint of one of those who are ""more-fans"". Despite the fact that I do have family in Liverpool, and have visited Anfield 5 times, I have never hidden the fact that I grew up in various countries in South-east Asia and currently work between Germany and Asia. My viewpoint, therefore, is from someone who sees so many so-called fans in so many countries, for whom football fandom is a fad, a sense of identity during drinking sessions, who watch about 5 matches a season and buys the kits as a form of fashion statement. Since I can't discount their identity as a Liverpool fan (as there is no entrance exam), it stands to reason that since the stadium attendee makes actual contribution to the club, he/she is definitely more important to the club than the global fan.

I appreciate that we have this extra support and I'm even grateful for the financial effect it has on the club.

I feel that a non scouse fan (UK fans included) can never have the same passion for the club that the scouse fans can have, mainly as some of the passion for the club is intrinsic to Liverpool as a place and the struggles of the city replicate those of the team etc.

I feel that a non native fan will never understand the rivalry with Everton and Manchester as well as I do. It does disappoint me to see that I struggle to get tickets for games that go to tourists and daytrippers.

I respect the point about decibels, the fact remains, it's the locals who've made the Anfield atmosphere famous, YNWA the most legendary anthem in football, and earned LFC the reputation of being home to one of best set of fans in the world. You can't deny them that, for that they deserve respect.

By virtue of being a representative, don't they have more responsibility and thus deserve more respect? 

The amount of downvotes (tame by my expectations) simply show how insecure people are. If someone said Samuel L Jackson or Daniel Craig is the manliest Liverpool fan, people would hardly object, because they know that the existence of someone manlier than them doesn't actually diminish their own manhood. Yet when someone claims that some fans are more of a fan than others, everybody gets defensive.

&gt; Newsnight, BBC Parliament, HardTalk, listen to BBC Radio 4

I'm glad you didn't include Question Time. I find them mostly quite trashy, not heavily promoted but pushed to periphery. The criticism is the type of information that is repeatedly given prime time and what isn't. You are almost implying that the BBC are reporting inline which public choice, but even if they do that then what they are delivering is more like entertainment: scary story, scary story, noble death of a soldier, sport, sport, funny story about kittens.

&gt; The Today Program

I tend to naturally avoid the BBC because anything they do is necessarily coloured and third hand information anyway. I also don't own a TV license, nor a TV. I've built my sources from a combination of social aggregators and experts. I don't need a journalist to editorialise what economics is saying, I'll find a range of economists to follow.

&gt; Rapist, context

Exactly, they can make the effort sometimes to find context if it suits. There might be a totally novel Wikileaks exposé, but cut-and-pasted at the tail of the article there will be more often than not, a reminder to the reader that he is a wanted sex pest.

Fine, people may want it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the BBC should be held up as the standard for journalism. The only thing impartial about the BBC is the weather, but even then they like to plug the sunny days so we all have a reason to feel happy about ourselves.",0,1338918947,null,0,false,0,c4wmmn1,t3_um1ye,t1_c4wmmn1,t1_c4wktpa,null,1429074464,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

When I was at school, about 100 years ago, my history teacher and my economics teacher had an argument about the semantics of being a supporter. The economics teacher insisted that the word 'supporter' implied some kind of financial contribution or some other tangible form of support. A 'fan' just wears the scarf. I think there's a bit of truth in it but it's not really important to me.

On a broader level, of course somebody growing up in an English city and going to the match with several generations of their family and going to school in that city is going to have a deeper understanding of their particular team and a deeper relationship to the club too. It's not a choice, it's just the way you were raised. That said, I left Liverpool years ago and always have to watch the match with foreigners. No problem.

I've been saying this since 9/11. 

&gt; Rather poor reading comprehension. 

Fine, I'll go through the first page of results ([news: ""militant+drone""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/news/?q=militant%20drone)): 

* 5th June: [Pakistan summons US envoy over drone strikes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18331827)

We find no mention of possible civilian deaths in this case, but of course there is testimony from the ever present anonymous official:

&gt; A senior US official told the BBC that Libi was the target of the attack in Hesokhel, to the east of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan. [...] The first missile struck the compound, killing three militants, Pakistani security officials said. A second missile then killed 12 more militants who had arrived at the scene, they added.

This is passively accepted, and reported at face value. No journalistic endeavour seems to have occurred beyond 'protecting sources'. The end with a nod to civilian deaths but they provide none of the many sources that try to estimate the collateral damage.

* 5th June: [US drone attack 'targeted al-Qaeda deputy' in Pakistan](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18327634)

Again we see the anon official:

&gt; A senior US official told the BBC that Libi was the target of Monday's morning strike in Hesokhel, to the east of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan.

And again more parroting of militant deaths:

&gt; The first missile struck the compound, killing three militants, Pakistani security officials said. A second missile then killed 12 more militants who had arrived at the scene, they added.

The are certain that these people are militants, yet we are told ""If Libi's death is confirmed, it would be a ""major blow to core of al-Qaeda"", the US official told the BBC"". There is a clear implication that they have no idea who they are targeting.

&gt; The strike comes days after more details of the Obama administration's drone policy emerged in the US.

Oh this looks interesting, but why don't the elaborate? If we look into what that actually means, a few days ago the Obama Administration made public their definition: ['any men killing in the strike zone of military age'](www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/singleton/). That's been common knowledge since the 29th of last month.

* 4th June: [US drone strike 'kills 15' in Pakistan](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18327634)

&gt; A second missile then killed 12 more militants who had arrived at the scene, they added.

They don't even run with an (un)official this time!

&gt; The strike comes days after more details of the Obama administration's drone policy emerged in the US.

Hang on I've read that before. Again where's the context? The next entry was the 28th which was before the official militant definition came out. I'll briefly look at that because it is getting tedious now.

* 28th May: [US drone 'kills six' in Pakistan's tribal north-west](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18232018)

&gt; An official told news agency Agence-France Presse that the drones were ""targeting a militant compound and a vehicle"".

Another anonymous official. Right, but where's the key information to help us understand what defines a militant. I'll search for 'obama militant':

* 29th May: [White House in first detailed comments on drone strikes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17901400)

That seems like the only source. No mention of what makes for a militant, but emphasis is on how drone attacks are helping win ""the war on the militant network"" and how this all has ""full accordance with the law"".

&gt; ""In short, al-Qaeda is losing badly. And Bin Laden knew it. In documents we seized, he confessed to 'disaster after disaster',"" Mr Brennan said.

What utter trashy, sterile deliberately exclusive journalism. It's PR. Lets look at some antagonists to the drone strikes:

&gt; [Virtually every time the U.S. fires a missile from a drone and ends the lives of Muslims, American media outlets dutifully trumpet in headlines that the dead were ”militants” – even though those media outlets literally do not have the slightest idea of who was actually killed. **They simply cite always-unnamed “officials” claiming that the dead were “militants.”** It’s the most obvious and inexcusable form of rank propaganda: media outlets continuously propagating a vital claim without having the slightest idea if it’s true.](http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/singleton/)

He also includes the real headline, that is buried on [the third of an eight page article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=2):

&gt;  **It in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants**, according to several administration officials, unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent. Counterterrorism officials insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good. “Al Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization — innocent neighbors don’t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs,” **said one official, who requested anonymity** to speak about what is still a classified program.




&gt; This counting method may partly explain the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths. In a speech last year **Mr. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s trusted adviser, said that not a single noncombatant had been killed in a year of strikes**.

So no it is not a failure of comprehension, however I will give you prejudiced, but prejudiced for many a good reason.

For fairness I'll search the *BBC** for Julian Assange and count the number of rape references in the first 5 hits. Okay I'll have to change that a bit because there are 5 videos reminding the reader that Assange's appeal of extradition has failed. Early *than** that we see [an article on Anonymous](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17648852), usually presented by the BBC as a criminal organisation, and they manage to shoe-horn in the following:

&gt; Anonymous is a loose group of ""hacktivists"" who came to the fore in 2010 in the wake of the emergence of Julian Assange's Wikileaks website.

Next we have a Wikileaks article on the Strafor Emails, and at the end, without fail:

&gt; [Mr Assange is currently on conditional bail in Britain while he fights extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17176602)

Next he appears in the Simpsons:

&gt; [Fox TV said Assange recorded his lines from the UK, where he is fighting extradition to Sweden over alleged sex offences - charges he denies.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17092968)

The next time his name pops up it is again reminding the reader that he is a favourite of Anon:

&gt; [Russian-based members of Anonymous also told the BBC they they had taken part in hacking attacks in various countries, including those on Visa, Mastercard and Paypal in late 2010 in support of the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16960681)

Next there is the connection between Manning and Assange is pushed:

&gt; [During his preliminary hearing, known as an Article 32 hearing, the court heard that Pte Manning held a data card containing 500,000 classified battlefield reports, as well as contact details for Julian Assange - the founder and head of Wikileaks.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16883409)

More crap articles, Simpsons, blah. Then a novel article on Assange's TV show:

&gt; [Mr Assange is fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16716904)

Are you sick of reading that literally tweaked copy-pasted context? The other repeated content is this linking of Assange with Manning. This is getting tedious and I don't expect you to have read any of this, but now I know I am not missing anything by shunning the BBC.",0,1338923278,null,0,1338923663,0,c4wnr1w,t3_um1ye,t1_c4wnr1w,t1_c4wlaub,null,1429074992,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I went to pretty much every Liverpool game when they played away in London or the surrounding area, and the occasional european match or cup game at Anfield, until I moved to America in 1999.

What I am saying is Doctor Who in it;s very fabric is British. If you were to Americanise it it would lose that quality that makes it so special.

There is no need to tinker with a great formula so why bother?

America has taken a huge amount of British shows to make an American version and whilst some have worked the vast majority either do not get past the pilot stage or not past the first season.

The rare exceptions seem to be certain comedies like the Office.

I love a lot of American Sci-fi and I would not wish to see a British version for similar reasons. America does it's kind of sic-fi in a way we cannot and if we tried it would not work.

Her sacrifice is so much more meaningful now.

That's when you know you've got a good story.  It not only sets up future installments, but it also enriches past ones.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that I'd been looking for an ongoing time travel piece that looked more into the implications of multiple time travelers dealing with the consequences of actions they haven't had and meeting each other at different points when I came across Doctor Who.  None of the stuff written under the direction of Davies did this.  It was only under Moffat, who fortunately laid the groundwork with Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, that this did happen.

Fans will likely be upset or sad for awhile, but you have to use that to make your show better, which means you have to try even harder to make them like the next character. Then you see shows like Grey's Anatomy (not saying comparable shows, but the first example I could think of) where they put people near death regularly and bring them back, to build suspense but not upset viewers.

I almost think because of those things Dr. Who should be left alone, but then again, because of social networking and communication, I believe tv studios are more in touch with their fans than ever.  I think america could actually make this work.  I really only want to see it happen in order to see american actors tapped for the character.  It would be amazing.  

Uhmazing.  I love british actors, but it seems a shame that this magnificent role is strictly theirs.  ",0,1338932277,null,0,false,0,c4wq24f,t3_um9oc,t1_c4wq24f,t1_c4wpusc,null,1429076083,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

But Doctor Who is fucking different, man. I love the queen, I love standing in queues, but NOTHING in me is more pure-UK than my love of Doctor Who. Doctor Who is quintessentially British, and it's a part of our culture.

That says more about the attitudes of the staff at those English medium schools you visited than it does about reality I'm afraid. 

&gt; ... Welsh having many borrowed words from English (which appears to have accelerated with technology related words, though I'm no expert) which suggests that Welsh has an anachronistic limitation

Do we have to wheel out this old cliche? No language is pure. Most coexistent or adjacent languages borrow heavily from each other, although the power balance of English and Welsh of course means that there are often many English words thrown into a Welsh sentence. Does this matter? Not really. There's a wide range of Welsh languaage registers, from more formal/literary Welsh which has less loanwords, to varied dialects and informal Welsh which slips comfortably between Welsh words and dotted English loanwords but firmly within a Welsh grammar. And after all, English is the most adept of all at borrowing words from other languages. 

As for words for new technology, does the fact that many French people still use 'l'email' mean that French is 'anachronistic'? I doubt it. As it happens 'ebost' is used as much of not more than 'email' in Welsh. by now. 

A living language does not need all of the new stuff immediately to still function as a living language. If it adapts, and keeps adding new words and variations in grammar organically, as Welsh still does, then that language is not going to be an anachronism any time soon.

You're actually arguing not that the BBC is biased but that it should be biased for you!

&gt;I'm glad you didn't include Question Time. I find them mostly quite trashy, not heavily promoted but pushed to periphery. The criticism is the type of information that is repeatedly given prime time and what isn't. You are almost implying that the BBC are reporting inline which public choice, but even if they do that then what they are delivering is more like entertainment: scary story, scary story, noble death of a soldier, sport, sport, funny story about kittens.

Question Time hardly carries the content the guests from all the political parties and questions the public put forward, although they have some scope to eliminate the poorer questions, from what they say.  The BBC does much more than news.  IF you want serious news tune into that, there's plenty of it; Hardtalk and BBC Radio4 get stuck right into it without pandering to a weaker cortex. If you want snap shot news, tune into that.  If you want CBeebies or Dancing On Ice or Eastenders, tune into that.  They do it all.

&gt;I tend to naturally avoid the BBC because anything they do is necessarily coloured and third hand information anyway

Witness--&gt;Reporter--&gt;Presenter.

3rd hand is pretty good.  It's when it claims to be Tweet or Facebook and 1st or 2nd anonymous hand there's a problem.

&gt;I also don't own a TV license, nor a TV.

Don't need one for iPlayer or the BBC radio.

&gt;I've built my sources from a combination of social aggregators and experts. I don't need a journalist to editorialise what economics is saying, I'll find a range of economists to follow.

Because economists all agree and economics is a summation of everything, especially when we're talking specifically about political and social policy.  

You might as well admit you're an ostrich.

&gt;Exactly, they can make the effort sometimes to find context if it suits.

Wait.  You just got through how you don't listen to it and now you're going to try and tell people what they say and what their policy is?

&gt;A senior US official told the BBC that 

So not the BBC claiming it then, rather the BBC reporting again what had been said.

&gt;The first missile struck the compound, killing three militants, Pakistani security officials said. 

So what Pakistani officials said, and the BBC reporting it. 

&gt;The strike comes days after more details of the Obama administration's drone policy emerged in the US.

There's no BBC interpretation either way there, they're just reporting what has been said.

You go on in this vein.  You don't want the BBC to actually report, which they are, you want them to voice your opinion and to tell others what they should think.  You've got news and reporting ass about tit.  They're supposed to tell you what people are saying and what is happening, to give a degree of accuracy, and to allow other people to think for themselves.  You want a dictatorial megaphone!

&gt;Anonymous is a loose group of ""hacktivists"" who came to the fore in 2010 in the wake of the emergence of Julian Assange's Wikileaks website.

Which is exactly what it is.  Which is why Wikileaks purposely courts mainstream publishers in the media as outlets...

&gt;Mr Assange is currently on conditional bail in Britain while he fights extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.

Which he is, and which he does...

&gt;Russian-based members of Anonymous also told the BBC they they had taken part in hacking attacks in various countries, including those on Visa, Mastercard and Paypal in late 2010 in support of the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

Which they did...

&gt;During his preliminary hearing, known as an Article 32 hearing, the court heard that Pte Manning held a data card containing 500,000 classified battlefield reports, as well as contact details for Julian Assange - the founder and head of Wikileaks.

Which by all account he did.  It is well known that he was their leak.

&gt;Mr Assange is fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.

Which he does.

&gt;""It's nothing to do with security; it's about players knowing you've only got a year left on your contract, and knowing that, it doesn't work basically, you know, 'he might not be here next season'""


**March 23**:

&gt;""Absolute nonsense. That is the biggest load of nonsense I have ever heard in my life,"" he said. ""They don't care whether I'm the manager next year. They wouldn't lose any sleep over that. That's football.""

&gt;""Footballers play the game, they come in every day and train. Someone else walks in here tomorrow – the king is dead long live the king! They don't worry. They don't think 'Harry is going to England' or 'he is going to go somewhere else'.

He's willing to openly commit himself when he's in a contract year, but who's to say the same bullshit won't happen if the England job opens up again in a year or two? It's an absolute crock of shit that he wasn't worried about the dressing room being split when he was the one causing the distraction but now suddenly he's going to use that as a threat to leverage a new contract. 

And now it's a ridiculous situation. Do we stick with a manager who is clearly not our long-term solution and risk losing some players that are loyal to him or transfer targets? How do we make this transition without fucking everything up?

I trust Levy to do the right thing. It would be a dream come true if we had a manager already lined up and if our transfer targets and some key players were informed and on board with it. 

But who knows if that's the case? It might be that we need to take a step backward before moving forward again with a new regime. Either that or we give Harry another 3 fucking years, always knowing that at any point we could get fucked over if he sees something else he likes. 

Personally I don't want to go into this season with a manager with one year left. Harry seems determined to make it a distraction--if it wasn't going to be one already.

They sanctioned my money for 4 months, I had to wait until I recovered to go down to the claims department in town and then tell them I needed the money to assist my mother because she has serious health issues (which she does) I had to go through 3 claims before they gave the OK and then had to wait 3 weeks for the forms to go through and finalise.

In that time I was expected to go out and find work with no money for travel for my signings at the job center, paper &amp; printer ink, photocopies or anything I was using previously to look for work. I couldn't even afford the wednesday telegraph for the job pages. I had to go into the newagents with a pen and paper and write down any jobs I could find in the pages before the owner caught on what I was doing and told me to leave.

When I finally got the money through I spent the first £64 on printer ink and paper, the second payment when towards saving for a new suit for interviews my third payment went towards travelling to the city to find work.

It's something I'd never wish on anyone, nobody should have to go through all that to find work. It was placing odds against me that I didn't really need, before I was sick I never missed a jobcentre signing and always applied for every job I had found advertised.

French are supposed to use *courriel*, according to the *Académie Francaise*. The Académie, one might argue, is attempting to avoid French becoming largely an historic footnote some centuries (decades may be) in the future.

French isn't really a good comparison (having probably greater than 3000 times as many speakers as Welsh does). How about Breton?

It's not an anachronism because it's not being used, not changing, not adapting. It's anachronistic in the way that pocket calculators are - nearly everyone already has a device on them that does everything that the calc does in it's limited field but that same device does far more in a far wider field; so instead of having a mobile phone and a pocket calculator (or watch) then another complementary device would be better.

true,honey_pie,null,null,"You list a whole bunch of ceremonial powers.. that could never be successfully exercised. You really think the army would follow the queen's order to war without parliament!?, Ha.

You say talk about income and income tax, well, if you can view the monarchy today as 'property' of the state, these things make sense. Whilst i'm sure the role has it's perks, these people did not choose it, and i'm not certain i would switch with them.

Similarly, with regard to 'their' land, ""it is no longer the private property of the reigning monarch and cannot be sold by him/her, nor do the revenues from it belong to the monarch personally"", managed by an independent organisation, with surplus revenues going to the treasury. see [Crown Estate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate). Consider the likely outcome of it being controlled by the government, that it would have all been sold off to developers for short-term political gain.

Tax havens says nothing about the queen, either. Use of the queen for propaganda ('queen and country').. is merely as a symbol of Britain and it's history, and could be easily replaced with no change. Also it is a use of monarchy, not a power they hold.

The case of the Chagos is an interesting one that I was not familiar with, but it seems you are a little misguided AFAICT. Firstly it has been depopulated since the 70's, secondly the 'queen's' powers used here were used *by* the British government, against the high court. If you are talking about the overruling of the Chagos 'government' (uninhabited, remember) well then your argument should be against colonialism, not today's monarchy. (FWIW [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depopulation_of_Diego_Garcia#Developments_since_2000) is my wiki source)

Finally, the monarchy as a tool to coerce acceptance of social hierarchy would make for a fascinating discussion over a joint, but whether or not you subscribe to that idea, again, it would be a using of the monarchy (by 'elites'), not a power of their own.

There seem to be a couple of occasions where Charles has 'abused' his power (and i object to them), but realistically, they are not significant, and i am not aware of any case of E2R doing so; she has done the best job of being a 'hand waving apolitical grandma' i think we could ask for, to be honest.",0,1338942443,null,0,false,0,c4wsbky,t3_uh79q,t1_c4wsbky,t1_c4vo4hr,null,1429077218,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To sum it up.

""Why do a large promotion support the Monarch"" (which should really be reworded to, ""Why do only a small amount disapprove of the Monarchy"" 

As I can guarantee not everyone will support the monarchy, but most will be against change or are indifferent.

To answer the question, We look at America and it's President as the head of state, we look at France, we look at Russia and everywhere else that involved politics in nominating it's head of states and we've come to the conclusion that the involvement of politics brings additional cost, is more of a political cocksabering with the party in charge effectively electing a President/Prime Minister.  A Queen or King allows us to fogo the stupid pointless elections.

The end result is the same, money would be spent on a Monarch or Pressident, but a Monarch that can trace it's heritage throughout the ages to a time of beginnings is special, when the Empire shrunk and our place in the world was questioned, the common people I think took solice in that so long as we continue the traditions and ceremony of having a Monarchy things could get better as the Monarchy pushed the Empire outwards, or perhaps we like to hold onto what we have left from that golden age and our Monarchy is just that, a crutch to hold onto.



Fucked if I know why we keep it up, all I know is the majority don't want to change, and the republican movement is seen in sort of a childish way, throwing their toys out the pram when the country is celebrating and blaming others for their lack of focus on why we should change.

The thing is if that system worked then there would be a lot more people down the jobcentre actually trying more than just sticking made up application attempts into their job seeker book but it doesn't work, as soon as they get put on a sanction they just apply for hardship making some tale up and find some documents to ""prove"" why they need the benefit and they just live on that until the sanction is lifted.

I've found that some people just prefer not doing work and would rather sit around all day watching TV.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Remember my opening sentence, I defined the queen as a network not as a single agent, and ""there is of course the power of the queen as an image which can be channelled for all manner of uses"". You pointed out (perhaps over a joint) that those would be the 'elites'. This seems like repetition, but it seems to hold that if you believe the 'elites' (of which the monarchy has membership) can use their image for leverage, then they personally can use their image.

I know about the Crown Estate, I've read parliamentary enquires that describe how the organisation can put profit ahead of public interest whith the danger of it acting like an abusive monopoly. 'The queen' gets to pick the executive board, so she has proxy control, and therefore power. It's not independent (what does that even mean) and it has special status with ownership of the sea bed, extensive farming land, shoreline, oil rights, dolphins (I think), etc. The Crown Estate is not subject to corporation, income or capital gains tax. It is therefore a tax haven, or at least very, very, privileged.

&gt; secondly the 'queen's' powers used here were used by the British government

Well that proves my point. There is Eliza the human, and the legal abstraction we call 'the queen'. If it is indeed the British government doing the overruling they are using the real power of the abstract 'queen', and to prevent abuse the abstraction needs dismantling. No?

Lets Kill Hitler was awful. The Doctor's Wife was the best episode of the season but not of the Moffat era - The Eleventh Hour, Amy's Choice, The Lodger, Vincent and the Doctor were all just as good and no other series six episode comes close to those. 

Closing Time was a lazy cash-in of the Craig character, The Girl Who Waited is the most overrated episode of the season and The God Complex was decidedly mediocre.

The River Song arc didn't all of a sudden quickly turn into a mess at the end. It was a steady decent the entire season.

true,Handsonanatomist,null,null,"Personally, I'd prefer David Tennant (though I do enjoy the Matt Smith era, but more for Karen Gillian), but exactly this!  1000 times this!  As an American, I love Doctor Who.  To Americanize it would be to lose some of the comedic camp that makes the show so fantasticly adorable.  The British twist makes the show more exotic for the American audience.  It's a refreshing change of pace from so much of the garbage that seems to be shoved down our throats these days. The Doctor does not need a gun.  He has the greatest weapon of all: wit.  He's just so damn clever. In fact, giving him a gun would ruin the Doctor.  The Doctor has killed, sure, but only by necessity and only when he has given them peaceful alternatives, so to arm the Doctor would be to fail to understand who the Doctor is at his very core.  He loves life.  He loves humanity.  He is here to redeem himself for all of the crimes in his past, and he seeks to do that because he loves what humanity has the potential to be.  He strives to embrace the best in humanity and wants us to each live up to that same standard.  To carry a gun would be to have the pessimistic view that bad things might happen and that is the antithesis of what the Doctor wants to be. The Doctor has a belief that there is always a happy ending, even when there is unhappiness too. I think the spirit of the Doctor was perfectly summarized in the Christmas special this year: ""Every time you see them happy, you remember how sad they’re going to be. And it breaks your heart. Because what’s the point of them being happy now, if they’re going to be sad later?

Mileage correction is allowed, but only to reflect a car's true mileage AFAIK. Say if you got a new instrument panel from a scrapyard or something.

If you have a car with a digital speedo like the new Honda Civic you're laughing, just press a button and it goes into km.

'Tourism revenue is not only irrelevant to a debate about our constitution, the suggestion that the monarchy promotes tourism is also untrue. There is not a single shred of evidence to back this up. Of the top 20 tourist attractions in the UK only one royal residence makes it: Windsor Castle at number 17 (beaten comfortably by Windsor Legoland, in at number 7). Royal residences account for less than 1% of total tourist revenue. Indeed, the success of the Tower of London (number 6 in the list) suggests that tourism would benefit if Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle were vacated by the Windsor family.

The British tourist industry is successful and robust - castles and palaces would remain a part of our heritage regardless of whether or not we have a monarchy (look at Versaille). Other attractions, such as the London Eye, Trafalgar Square, the west end, Bath, Stonehenge, Britain's beautiful countryside and so on, will continue to attract tourists in the same numbers as they do today. The government body responsible for tourism, Visit Britain, hasn't even collated statistics on the monarchy as an attraction, which shows it is not a key factor in the promotion of the UK as a tourist destination.

The tourism argument has been dreamt up to distract people from the real issues. There is no evidence that the monarchy is good for tourism, in fact, there are good reasons why the opposite might be true. Imagine the potential for Buckingham Palace if it was fully opened up to tourists all year round, where visitors can explore every room and courtyard and see the grounds and the magnificent art collection. And of course popular ceremonies such as the changing of the guard will continue.

You can't call things 'claims' just because you're ignorant about them; it doesn't work that way.

&gt;No I need to see evidence to back up the claim that ""The Royal family brings in lots of tourist dollars"" I haven't seen any yet. I suspect there isn't any.

[Suspecting isn't the same as googling - £500 million a year](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx). Now, you could suggest that these involve visits to buildings, and therefore don't have anything to do with the Royals - but you'd be wrong. The most popular postcard sent home from the UK is of the Queen, for example (more examples in that article), and don't forget; there are plenty of ex-royal palaces around the world, and they do a good trade - but a live, working royal palace? Different scale completely...for example, try telling a five year old girl that the building in front of her *used* to have a princess in, and then show her one that has a princess in *now*. The difference in reaction doesn't go away with age, and that's before we get to addressing that this isn't 'a' royal family, it's *the* royal family :-)

For a start they don't just sell stuff off. I notice a Mark I Dalek there, from 1963 in near PERFECT condition. If this is real it's worth well in excess of £10,000. It would also be by far the best preserved Dalek from this era. They ONLY gave away *two* Mark I Daleks, and that was to Childrens homes in the local area. They ended up calling this Daleks back in order to make the first Doctor story 'The Chase.' They also used some Movie Daleks (with a spraypaint) for this story - they are easy spotted and mostly inanimate: http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/images/smooth-seam.png

This Dalek, and the other genuine looking Dalek were no doubt made by This Planet Earth Limited, a company that produces replicas of classic Daleks for around £3,000. As for the other blackdomed Dalek, that is a very poor home job. **Not** a professional build.

I'd say the Mark II Cyberman is a professionally made replica head, stacked onto a - quite frankly very amateur - chest unit and costume. 10 points for effort but this would never pass as 'genuine.' 

The K9 is also not screen-used. K9 went through four different varients in the classic series, this is a jumble of all of them, and the head is way to thin.

The 'Earthshock' style cyberman is probably also This Planet Earth Ltd stock, but, along with the others COULD have been purchased at the Longleat exhibition auction in the late 1990's. I doubt it though. So perhaps some of these probs are from the Longleat auction, some are good quality replicas from This Planet Earth.

I'd say the Ood and the Rill are very similar to items I've seen on eBay within the last two months, retailing at around £300 each. Made by very talented artists. I don't believe they are genuine though. I'd love to see certificates of authenticity if they exist - and if they are real, they would have been issues with a CoA.

**TL/DR:** Great collection of varying quality. I'd be dubious if any bar one or two items were screen used though.

The company I worked for handled it by having a minimum 2 year contract with a 2k buyout to leave before that term if you stayed past probation (6 months). It has drawbacks of course, but I stayed 2 and a half years, got well trained and even began to train the new wave below me before I left.

The problems with workfare: A personal story.
For those who do not know, I am a grammar boy born into unimaginable poverty that would the eyes pop out of your head. Most of the tales regarding the life endured on the lowest rung of the ladder are unrepeatable but I can tell you this one.

My two brothers having failed the 11+ (or the 10+ as I call it, since you sit it when you are 10) were destined for the scrap heap. The only school option open to them was St Joe's a local comp which I wish all the very best but it done little for them.  For example, my brother with a life passion for art had no art teacher for GCSE, although my other brother got pass grades in English &amp; Maths - but heaven's know how in that school. They both told tales of misery, bullying, under-achievement and truancy. The best teachers went to the four local grammars.

My brothers graduated from St Joe's under a Tory government with nothing to progress into. Unemployment in the town was so high that one in every three adult males was out of work. But the Tories had a solution- workfare!

They decided with my elder brother's math skills that he would be suited to a clerical role. They positioned him (unpaid) in a bookshop where he performed stock takes, ordered replenishment and event reconciled the books. He loved it but it ended after a year with no job. The following year the bookshop simply hired another unpaid 'apprentice'. My brother progressed to a mirror glass factory where his computer skills saw him design and manufacture family crests on mirrors. But after a year it ended with no job. Pity, my brother loved it. Soon, the company simply hired another unpaid worker to replace him. 

My younger brother did not have the same academic grounding and he knew it. He was content to convert his excellent artistic ability into painting and decorating. He painted walls faithfully for a year - unpaid. At the end of the year his placement ended only to be replaced by another. He then took up a bricklaying apprenticeship. He worked  for 2 years as an unpaid 'labourer' carrying bricks. His already mal-nutritioned physique gathered stretch marks at his biceps from carrying breeze blocks. His skin tore so badly because he had yet to complete puberty. He worked every morning from 7am until 5pm. He never received a penny for his payment. The placement ended with no job.

All the while I went to grammar, got my 3 A-levels and progressed to University. Within a year of both placements ending my two brothers a) took drugs b) tried to commit suicide. 

I aint that fond of unpaid workfare.",0,1338986174,null,0,false,0,c4wz2f7,t3_un5c4,t1_c4wz2f7,t3_un5c4,null,1429080461,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Well, what we're doing now is pure conjecture, but if he does bring in Gylfi, then its pretty fair to say that he rates Gylfi higher than Jonjo. 

The attacking midfield position is one that is full of problems. Theoretically, we have about 4 players in this position: Gerrard, Cole, Aquilani and Shelvey. Two of these players, however, are very doubtful since they just came back on loan. 

Cole probably thinks that he should still get a 1st team place, and he is unlikely to get that at Liverpool. Despite the fact that he returned from Lille on loan, that doesn't exactly rule out him going back there on a permanent basis, or going to another club. Regardless of what the Lille coach said, there has been no news of them making any offer, and of course we're not going to let him stay there on loan while paying the bulk of his wages. Chances are, the gaffer just wants to have a good look at him before making any decision. I really won't be surprised if Lille comes in for him once the Hazard deal is done and they get more cash.

Aquilani is another unknown. I know he played fairly well in the half season where he was fit, but he hasn't played in England for 2 years now, and the fact that neither Juventus nor AC Milan made an offer for him might point to some doubts about his ability or fitness. If he didn't come back with any lingering fitness problems, it wouldn't be a bad thing to keep him. The thing, however, is that it would likely be better to play him more as a deep-lying playmaker than as an attacking midfielder, so as to make good use of his passing ability while protecting his fitness. 

This leaves Gerrard and Jonjo. (Well, Henderson could possibly play here too, but I really think he would be better in the playmaker role, and if Aquilani stays he will have a very experienced mentor to learn from.) Gerrard is 32 years old, has injury problems, and while he is a first team choice, he is unlikely to be fit too often. This means that Jonjo will have to take up the position half the time, and frankly I don't think he's up to it yet. He has bags of talent, but I think he needs a couple of years to build up his ""footballing intelligence"" before he really comes good. The situation with Gerrard requires us to have 2 first team attacking midfielders for rotation, not to have 1 main attacking midfielder and 1 as a backup. To that end, it would be best if we had someone like Gylfi, who will definitely come cheap, lowering the risk. 

Other than the right wing, every other position we're looking is for a back-up. Defensive midfield, left-back, striker or even left-wing. I know some have speculated that Suarez will be played on the right, but that doesn't take away the fact that we don't have a right winger. When you have only 1 real winger, it makes it easier for the opponents to defend against you. Have a right-wing counterpart to Downing allows us to change our formations around and switch flanks freely. It also allows us to play Suarez in a third position, that of attacking midfield.  In games where we need more width, this would be very useful, since Suarez can drift out to either flank and overload the defence there.

Then we will buy more players again next transfer window, using the same justification that nobody is good enough for sure. Fair enough?

The reason Rafa revamped the academy was to make LFC a club that is self-sustainable with the academy producing players for the first team. They always referred to the Barca youth system which has seen players like Xavi and Iniesta promoted to the first team. To say whether our graduates are good enough, well we are not sure yet, they are not really tested. But if we resort to buying players every time we have tactical issues in the first team, and while doing so, blocking the chance of our younger players to be tested, I guess we will never know.

Pacheco was touted as the a great player who could make it. After being pushed around many times, even he is unsure where he would end up now. We have kids like Sterling, Suso, Robinson, Adorjan, Ibe who are very(3) promising young players. But if we stick to this buy-to-replace policy, it won't be surprising to see if these kids either excel somewhere else, or buried in lower league teams somewhere (Remember Palsson?)
 
These are some of the reasons I don't like getting new players as a first go-to solution to any tactical problem. Oh, he's shit, sent him out on loan and let's buy that guy. Ah, he's not working too, buy that fella. At the end of the season, we would have a team of failed guinea pigs and paying wages for players playing for other teams.

Would the same media storm be generated if Obamas kids got married? Did you read much about Chelsea Clintons marriage?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"What/ Who is this a quote from? Because it makes several leaps-of-convenience.

&gt;There is not a single shred of evidence to back this up.

Not true. Just one example - the most popular postcard sent home from the UK is of the Queen; why would people do this if they only wanted to visit the buildings? The answer (I would suggest) is because they don't share your view of the monarchy...but the fact that there are several other avenues you could pursue (and obviously haven't) speaks volumes anyway.

&gt;Royal residences account for less than 1% of total tourist revenue.

You only consider residences as royal? Royal-related sites bring in £500 million, despite some of them being free. So again, you're cherry-picking.

&gt;that tourism would benefit if Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle were vacated by the Windsor.

The Queen has never lived in the tower. And you're ignoring *why* people want to visit BP (where they can actually see inside a lot of it already) - a piece of history is different from a functioning palace. You really need to look at how *tourists* view the royals instead of assuming they'd agree with your logic.

&gt;castles and palaces would remain a part of our heritage regardless of whether or not we have a monarchy (look at Versaille). 

Yes they would, but you're ignoring the outcome. Ask someone (or more easily, children) which they'd like to visit/ see the most - a palace where a princess used to live, or a working palace where a princess lives right now? Now address how this means nothing in terms of revenue.

&gt;Other attractions, such as the London Eye, Trafalgar Square, the west end, Bath, Stonehenge, Britain's beautiful countryside and so on, will continue to attract tourists in the same numbers as they do today.

That's like saying OSX will still sell if Windows goes, so who will miss Windows? Apply this to royal-related sites - do you have any evidence of your own that revenues wouldn't be affected?

&gt;Visit Britain, hasn't even collated statistics on the monarchy as an attraction, which shows it is not a key factor in the promotion of the UK as a tourist destination.

Actually, they have. If you mean [this site,](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx), then look at the figures for money brought in - what satistics are you talking about? It appears as if you're trying to seperate the monarchy from the sites and places associated with them, which can't really be done unless someone shares your outlook (which based on the income appears to be a minority one), then complain that this appears to justify your thinking - it doesn't work like that. Alternatively, find a royal site to visit abroad in a country that has no royals any more, that brings in *more* money...although bear in mind that even if you could, we're talking about the most famous royal family in the world. Try visiting Leopold's palace in Brussells and see how many queues you don't have to fight through.

&gt;The tourism argument has been dreamt up to distract people from the real issues.

Actually, it's been around for years, because it's only an argument for people that have issues with it...but you haven't actually stated what the 'issues' you mention are.

&gt;There is no evidence that the monarchy is good for tourism, in fact, there are good reasons why the opposite might be true.

Visitbritain seems to disagree. They certainly offer far more evidence and statistics than you do.

&gt;Imagine the potential for Buckingham Palace if it was fully opened up to tourists all year round, where visitors can explore every room and courtyard and see the grounds and the magnificent art collection.

Your reasoning seems to be based on visitors wanting to see buildings and not caring if the royals are involved or not - which without anything to back it up is another statement based on assumption. And that's ignoring the fact of BP being partially open already, as well as the difference between 'functional' and 'historical' being quite large in terms of interest and revenue. You'd have to demonstrate in advance that attendences wouldn't go down.

true,Rooster89,uk,Surrey,"Yes, two months of service under my belt. I love every minute of it. I joined up because I wanted to become a full time officer, had a passion for policing from a very early age and finally made that dream a reality. 

If your looking for a career in policing there is no better way than starting as a special. It's a great way of testing the water before diving straight in. It will also greatly improve your personal skills and confidence. A year a go I was quite timid and shy, now I can stand up for myself, make key decisions in my day job and speak my mind. I feel a million times better for doing it!

Remember with the application stage to just be yourself, they are looking to see the real you, don't be afraid to speak up. 


Once out on the streets it can be very daunting at times. As I've only been in two months there are times when I feel a bit out of my depth, but I always have my colleagues there to help. It's like having one big extended family! 

You need to be impartial, and be able to treat everyone the same, from the drunks you meet on the street, to the elderly people waiting for the bus. Respect everyone, treat everyone how you would expect to be treated and you'll be fine. Don't think ""because I'm a police officer I need to be stern and fair"". Remember you are human, talk to people, be yourself, guaranteed you will get more respect for just being human. 

The job is dangerous at times. You will need to make snap decisions. There will be times when you feel so uncomfortable you want to just get away, the public will expect you to deal with a situation, you can't shy away. But completing that job is such an incredible feeling. Knowing that you've helped someone, even if it's the littlest thing, like returning a cat to it's owner. You know you can go home smiling at the end of the day.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"No, you have completely misunderstood my reasoning. The issue is that with Gerrard's injury problems and age, Liverpool needs another first-team midfielder NOW. Not 2 years later. If Rodgers buys Gylfi, or any other attacking midfielder, then obviously he feels that Jonjo is not good enough NOW. 

Revamping the academy doesn't guarantee any success, it creates a framework and infrastructure that makes success more likely. Comparing the Liverpool academy, or any academy for that matter, to La Masia is silly. Firstly, the current crop of La Masia graduates have been 10 years in the making, with a clear football philosophy behind them. The current crop of our academy products have not been brought up in a consistent football philosophy and trained accordingly. Also, La Masia, and most Spanish clubs, have an advantage in that their B teams play in the lower divisions. This provides them regular competitive football against other professional teams, something which does not exist in England. 

The equivalent in England, however, is loaning out young players to clubs in lower divisions. That is not pushing our players around, it is the literal equivalent of what the Spanish clubs do with their youngsters in the B teams. 

I find it strange that you are complaining about pushing our players around on loan, yet lamenting that our youngsters don't get a chance to prove themselves. Going out on loan is exactly our youngsters' chance to prove themselves. Just because we have youngsters who are promising does not mean that they will end up being good, or even great players. You cited Dani Pacheco, who only managed a handful of games at Rayo. Surely, if he is not good enough for a team that finished 15th in La Liga, you wouldn't argue that he is good enough for our first team? 

Having faith on the younger players is good. Depending on them despite their lack of ability is not. Having a young player in the team who isn't ready for first-team action simply lowers the overall quality of the team. Being touted as the next-big-thing doesn't automatically make them that. Spearing was touted as the next big thing too, but simply collapsed this season when he showed how woefully unprepared he is to take on the role of defensive midfielder. Do we then keep on playing him in the hope that he will ""prove himself"" eventually? 

Your final sentence is incredibly unfair, and I think makes you come off as bitter. The only player whose wages we paid for while on loan was Joe Cole. He never looked like he made an effort while playing for us, and having him out on loan with us paying the bulk of his wages is better than keeping him in the wings with us paying ALL of his wages. I'd like to ask, if we have positions where we are lacking and the youngsters aren't good enough, what do you propose we do? Show faith in our youngster and cross our fingers?

**Rodgers' football is summed up in:**

about one-touch football, about positional play
4-3-3 and later even the 3-4-3 system
use possession as a defensive and offensive tool. Keeping the ball means they don’t have to go get it, and so they remain fresher than their opponent. Should they lose the ball this extra energy will go into extreme pressing in order to win it back.
This is what he meant in the following statement 

&gt;""The only time we rest is when we have the ball.""

Brendan Rogers had done something similar with Swansea City
but you can’t go for 90 minutes, so in order to recuperate and conserve energy, we’ll do that sometimes by building our way through the game — our tiki-taka football

Best of all it gave me a whole new dimension to my life that fed my knowledge of London and humans in general, gave me loads of stories to entertain friends and probably got me through a few job interviews and assessment centres for corporate jobs (awesome interview material!). 
However, I find out a few nasty things about the police that I didnt like.  Experienced the negative side of cliques and shitty attitudes in my unit.

We also had a lot of e-learning pushed on us all the time (especially with the changes to PC applications going through the special route).  I had just had a child and couldnt justify volunteering for that amount of time any more.

I never intended to go full police.  I imagine it'd make a big difference if you are because I guess you feel like you're sacrificing a lot of time but you know that is leading to something bigger.

Take the second world war for example.  The main thing that kept this country going, unlike the rest of Europe was it's moral.  [We just Kept Calm and Carried on](http://kihm2.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/blitz-london-1940.jpg).

The hours are selected by you, and they work around your availability. Most forces request that you complete 16 hours a month (which is actually really easy to achieve once you're out there.) 

I like to work the same shift hours as a regular officer rotation, so I tend to work a night shift or a day shift. Most the time thats 6pm till 3am. On average I complete about 70-80 hours a month.

If the ball has to be 'thrown forward' instead of a killer ball being played, you have 1, maybe 2 players moving to go and win then control the ball. All this gives the defence time to organise. With Modric, we could win the ball through the back four and Mikel, then use Modric as the conduit between the defensive and attacking phases of play. This would allow the attacking players to remain a bit further forward and make their runs with more confidence

I think Modric behind that attacking lineup would be outrageously productive. Also with Ramires, he has bags of energy and pace but he isn't better than any of the players in their natural positions. I see him more as the player used when the lack of tracking back from Hazard and Hulk may be a problem.

Germans somehow managed to be ultra-nationalistic in the 1940s despite for the longest amount of time being a bunch of loosely connected tribes.

Even the people who make up nations haven't remained constant. There is no such thing as an english person. I read recently that 15% of the english population is of recent french ancestry.

true,bobbo_,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"Neither BBC News or the British Lung Foundation make it particularly easy to read their brand new report,  I had to dig around on the BLF website to find it: www.lunguk.org/Resources/British%20Lung%20Foundation/Website/The%20impact%20of%20cannabis%20on%20your%20lungs%20-%20BLF%20report%202012.pdf

I have a particular issue with the claim ""This suggests that smoking just one cannabis 
cigarette increases the risk of developing lung cancer 
by a similar amount as smoking 20 tobacco cigarettes"" in reference to [this paper](http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/31/2/280.long) (*Aldington S, Harwood M, Cox B et al. Cannabis use 
and risk of lung cancer: a case-control study. In: Eur 
Respir J,  Feb, 31(2), 280-286 p*). The paper draws this conclusion from a reported 8% increased risk of lung cancer after smoking 1 joint per day, for a year. There is no evidence presented in the BLF report or the paper it cites that ""just one"" instance of smoking a Cannabis cigarette is similar to ""smoking 20 tobacco cigarettes"". The BLF fail to mention that this finding is related to a year of regular cannabis use, not a single instance of smoking a Cannabis cigarette as their report would imply. 

Thanks to the BLF's fairly biased use of evidence, someone at the BBC decided that ""[when smoking cannabis] the risk of lung cancer is actually 20 times higher."". This is clearly unsubstantiated in the paper cited by the BLF. The report says that the risk of lung cancer per Cannabis cigarette, *when smoking at least one Cannabis cigarette per day*, is *approximately* equivalent to the risk of smoking a single tobacco cigarette. Their claim that cannabis is 20 times worse than tobacco is incorrect when they refer to extended cannabis user compared to (as far as I can tell) a single use of tobacco.

tl;dr: The BLF's claim that ""just one"" Cannabis cigarette is similar to ""20 tobacco cigarettes"" is unsubstantiated. The BBC then wrote a fairly sensationalist article with very much incorrect facts based on a misrepresentation of facts by the BLF.

true,[deleted],null,null,"- You don't get to ignore Diana's work because you choose to reduce it to a rogue trip. This is what the Foreign Secretary of the day had to say to the House of Commons to put it into appropriate perspective, ""All Honourable Members will be aware from their postbags of the immense contribution made by Diana, Princess of Wales to bringing home to many of our constituents the human costs of landmines. The best way in which to record our appreciation of her work, and the work of NGOs that have campaigned against landmines, is to pass the Bill, and to pave the way towards a global ban on landmines.""  That in turn did indeed pave the way for the Ottawa Treaty.  Robin Cook is openly saying that Diana dragging landmines to the public's attention had resulted in their constituencies making it such an issue the politicians had to do something.  When Diana threw her weight behind the 'International Campaign to Ban Landmines' it was game, set and match, she brought the publicity and the public support, and elected politicians only had one way to act.  You might choose to dismiss the role she played but the Landmine Survivors Network Conference made sure to commemorate and remember her a year after her death, and to pay tribute to how much she'd done: ""A moving tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, was made through a slide show reviewing her trip to Bosnia with LSN in early August 1997. Landmine survivors spoke passionately about the memories of her time with them in their homes.""  [These people are in no doubt that she helped.](http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/google_search_results/google_advanced?cx=015627411728883415436%3Agyzfado4rwk&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=diana+princess&amp;sa=Go)

- Harry's work isn't just supporting the soldiers he is employed by.  I specifically mentioned Lesotho, where his charity Sentebale works with orphans.  I pretty damn sure he knows exactly where it is since he's been there several times.  When Harry and William did their first joint official trip together it was Harry's Sentebale that they went to,

- Prince Philip championed conservation and catapulted the WWF into the stratosphere when nobody had known who they were.

- Charles took a struggling cottage industry and turned organic farming commercially viable for small farms.  He was openly ridiculed when he first started.  20 years later and willingly paying a little extra for organic produce has become a second nature for many.  Charles helped create a demand which in turn saved farms and put better produce on the shelves.  

- As for Charles not going after rainforest deforestation, he only went and set up The Prince's Rainforest project and has worked and spoken at length on it.  He only went and addressed the Oslo Climate and Forest Conference in 2010 where financing between 50 governments was agreed upon.  He only went up and gave [the keynote speech](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_oslo_climate_and__181764716.html)! Before that he was up before the Copenhagen Climate Summit.  Prince Charles was the one that lobbied and addressed international governments looking them in the eye on a world stage and told them they had 100 months to sort the problem out before a tipping point is met.  He kept them to it too meeting with them again a year later to tell them how long they had left.  He squeezed $4.5bn out of them for the 2010-2012 period alone.  [Even the governments of other countries recognised that Charles was the leader of the cause and had been championing it long before they became aware and that it was he that brought them together.  The Norwegian leader made no bones about the role HRH Prince Charles had played.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QDGTu9Dou4)

- As for Prince William doing nob all as a patron, when the heir to the throne agrees to sleep rough on the street three days before Christmas  and then goes to the charity's kitchens to serve food and talk to people it raises a lot of publicity for the charity.  This is what the chief executive had to say, ""William has always said that he doesn't want to be a stand-off patron.  He takes a keen interest in what’s going on and we keep him regularly briefed. For someone of his ilk of his own accord to come and meet them is a powerful motivator.    I’ve seen William talk to people, meet them six months later and ask them what progress they’ve made. That’s hugely powerful for young people.”   What does William actually do at Ceterpoint - he's constantly popping in and out and in the media with it.  Maybe you remember the wedding?  William and Kate announced that they didn't want to receive wedding presents, instead they set up a Charitable Gift Fund for their favourite charities.  When still in high demand following their nuptials William took Centerpoint representatives with him on his tour of America.  These aren't the actions of 'nob all'.

&gt;These people have their names attributed to them by charity so often but generally they don't do shit to deserve it.

You've made it clear that you don't know what you're talking about - at all.  You are making a lot of assumptions, you are making a lot of noise, but you're not concerning yourself with honesty or presenting informed opinion.

Even the staunchest republican should be able to admit that the Royals do a lot for charity.

I especially like the /r/barca-style trophies. I know that they used to be in their header, but they were moved to the top of their sidebar. In my opinion, both look good. I think putting the trophies in the header below ""chelsea fc"" could look great, but the simple look we have going on right now is crisp and clean. 

The only ideas I can think of that have not been discussed:

* Maybe a sidebar table with current players in European competition and/or completed transfers this summer (see r/coys, as sad as it would be to take an idea from them). I also like their blogroll (could be used for either Redditor's blogs or frequently referenced blogs like WAGNH).
* Maybe an important Chelsea quote? We've had a few good ones lately with Drogba departing, players coming in, Champs League victory. Just a thought.

If you allow it to become normal for work done to be ""free"" because it provides experience then where can that lead? Companies ditching anyone looking for pay for the work in favour of those - possibly such as yourself - who are happy to do it without expecting more in compensation than free beer / festival entry etc. 

You're free to work for free of course - such is the beauty of choice - but to expect that of others is crazy and paves the way for a highly destructive environment where every worker bids at the lowest price and top-heavy companies can flourish by paying their low-run works peanuts and keeping the bonuses themselves.

Providing a service has little to do with whether someone was a volunteer or not. Both paid and unpaid people provide a service. I'm not sure where you're going with that.

The work experience people were being assessed, as I understand it. It is not normal to be paid during an assessment. It is normal to pay for it, as I mentioned in my previous post. The people on jobseeker's should have been paid, unless they too were being assessed for an NVQ, which I'm not sure of.

Working for free in some situations is already the common norm. Stewarding, safety cover, work experience and internships are all examples.

It is unusual for a company to pick people working for free over paid workers, as those on pay are contracted and have to work a certain amount of time/give notice.

And remember, there will be some stinkers, but all series' have them. They make the gems even better.

I had heard about Blink before I started watching. It took a Doctor Who spoof on Community to make me finally decide to check it out. When I did, I started from ""Rose"" and watched in order from beginning to the most recent Christmas special. Now I am eager to see the next season.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. 

Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1339014760,null,0,false,0,c4x5hpt,t3_uoanx,t1_c4x5hpt,t3_uoanx,null,1429083493,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

It's what the NHS changes are about, and it has applied to a lot of other services for many years now. If it is true that this works in other public services, which is what is claimed, then why does it not apply to the police.

I am suspicious that Lancashire police are doing what certain Labour councils are also accused of doing, which is to concentrate cuts in areas which will cause greatest public alarm, in an attempt to maintain a large bureaucracy, covering a large number of jobs that might well be more efficiently served by a different approach. I really don't know why the police need to employ graphic designers and sports centre staff for example. If someone can provide me with figures that show how this is better then I will believe it, in the meantime I suspect there may be an element of bureacrats protecting their fiefdom.",0,1339015730,null,0,false,0,c4x5qq0,t3_unzw6,t1_c4x5qq0,t1_c4x5b90,null,1429083610,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also when the woman from a major fashion house was invited to talk using her informed opinion, and discuss how the Queen has always been able to stay away from normal fashion and has made her own, the other one from the One Show decided that she'd pipe up with her ""extensive knowledge"" and cut to some guy from Horrible Histories (who was actually pretty funny I'll give him that, but still not really relevant at all).

true,dsnmi,null,null,"&gt;You can't call things 'claims' just because you're ignorant about them; it doesn't work that way.

Yes it does. The claim is: ""The Royal family brings in lots of tourist dollars."" That's a claim that someone has made on this thread and is made in other places. I'm merely asking for people to provide some evidence to assert that claim. If it's a true statement there should be available evidence to back it up. 

Thankyou for that link, it's the first one that anyone has provided (and I did search myself). It's still not very convincing though is it? For a start you might want to correct your error about the Queen being the most popular postcard sent from the UK. The article contains no data about the actual postcards sent home it contains the results of a survey in which people were shown 15 different postcards and asked to choose which one they'd send. And she actually came third, twice as many people would send a double decker bus. 

When you look at the actual details of what is being visited it's hard to claim the Queen deserves all the credit. If people were coming specifically to see her you'd expect Buckingham Palace to be the number one drawcard but it's way down the list after the Tower of London, Grenwich and Cathedrals, all of which exist without her. It's a bit rich to claim 500 million pounds can be credited to the Royal Family when you include St Paul's and Westminster abbey. Are they seriously trying to claim that the only reason people visit these wonders of architectural, historical and religious significance is because of the Queen? And what about the National Maritime Museum? Seriously?

That link actually proves the Royal family's tourist draw is way over rated. Only 402,000 people visited Buckingham Palace. That's a surprisingly paltry figure. When you consider the London Eye gets 3.5 million visitors per year it puts a lot of things into perspective.  2.5 Million visit Madam Taussauds a year and an amazing 5 million visited the Tate Modern. More than ten times as many people want to see modern art than see where a Queen lives, what does that do for your princess theory?

The article you provided proves that history is a huge drawcard for England and people love to see historic buildings. It does nothing to back up the claim that The Royal Family bring in a lot of tourist dollars. If anything it goes a long way to disproving it.

He knows it's complete b.s. that the CL is not important.  Consistent CL qualification at the moment seems to be the best way to increase funds which equals improving your team.  Not only that, but it's no secret that Levy's main objective for Redknapp was to get into the CL again.

That said, if you look at his time at the helm in total, he's been fantastic and deserves a new contract.  He's made mistakes but overall we are looking positive.  Yes there is still a long way to go until next season, with plenty of players going in/out, but I'm not sure who we could realistically bring in to replace him that would markedly improve our position.  I agree that tactically he has shown his weaknesses, but he has strengths as well such as motivating the players and keeping the squad performing.  I also like the coaching team he's put together.  Credit must be given to them for the performances and thus Redknapp as well since he put the team together.

I say give him a 1 year extension to his contract and a bonus/raise.  If he can't take us back into the CL next season, then bring someone new in.

I feel like if we switched managers this summer, a lot of the team will be dismantled.  I still feel like our squad with 2 or 3 major improvements could challenge for trophies next season, and I really believe that losing players like Modric, Bale or van der Vaart will set us back.  I can easily see a scenario where we lose key players like that and fail to properly replace them and instead rely on players we have to step up, with the odd signing of lesser quality.  In my opinion, it would take us backwards to replace Redknapp at this moment since I can't see us getting a major talent to manage us this window. 

The fact that we failed to secure CL qualification has severely limited our options this summer both in getting players and a potential new manager.

true,Ch13fWiggum,eng-Herefordshire,Herefordshire,"Long story short, and essentially a very rough explanation with a few errors mixed in probably

There were three countries on the Island known as Great Britain; England, Scotland and wales. Wales and England kick off, have a bit of a war, England fucks Wales' shit up. in the peace deal Wales demanded that they have their own prince. Sure thing says the king of England - you can have my first born son as the prince of wales - which unites england and wales, wales no longer being a country, but a principality.

so a few hundred years down the line, the last Tudor (Elizabeth I) kicks the bucket, one problem - no direct heirs, male or female. Well this is a bit of a shitter, says england, we need a monarch - who's the nearest relative? 
I am, says King James the VI of Scotland - where upon the kingdoms of Scotland and England (combined with the principality of wales) are basically conjoined.

This is then formalised 100 odd years later in 1707 (following a civil war, the deposing of the monarch for a theocratic lord protector, followed by the deposing of the Lord Protector's son and the restoration of the monarchy) by the act of the Union - which formally unites the kingdoms of Scotland and England, the outlying islands.

So that's the United Kingdom.

in 1997 a new policy of devolution was brought in allowing greater autonomy for the country to England's North (Scotland) along with the counties of Ireland that are still part of the UK and the principality of Wales. 

There are local taxes, but these go to the local council normally the size of a small city or a county. There are also national taxes - these go directly to the Treasury and some will be distributed back to the Scottish Parliament, Stormont (Northern Ireland) or The Welsh Assembly. I believe that there are separate tax raising powers in Scotland, but not in wales or N.I.

They do have separate budgets and their own fiscal responsibility

Scotland has retained a separate legal system since the time of the union, whereas England and Wales share a legal system.

This has brought in the problem that, when parliament votes on issues that only apply to England - MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are able to vote on the bills, despite them not representing any of the people that the bill will affect - this is called the West Lothian question.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"I think it's an oversimplification of supporters and none of them, not even one and three, are mutually exclusive. I know plenty of supporters who are constantly critical of the team, but hold season tickets and live and breathe LFC. 

As a lifelong, 32 year old supporter, I remember how gutted the fans were when Kenny took the job at Blackburn. Most supported him, but many supporters shouted ""Judas!"" from the Kop when he visited Anfield that season. We had a team of aging legends and many still consider that time the start of our decline as the dominant team in England.

I support the club *always*, but no manager or player is beyond reproach, simply because I think LFC represents something bigger than any one person. It also depends on the crowd, too. I may something to a fellow Red that I would never say to United fan. It's sort of like the scene in the Godfather when Michael says ""you don't discuss family business in public"".

""A country of countries"" is a more fitting way of putting it.
Each country in the UK has a parliament (this didn't use to be so, and devolution has created this) so Northern Ireland has a parliament, wales has one, Scotland has one also. There is a centralised government in London that is the main government of the UK. So the majority of laws/policies/politics in general goes on in London. Good examples of this would be foreign policy or the military. But many local politics goes on in local parliaments. This can include things such as education, infrastructure and healthcare. Referring to taxes, each country receives (this is one part that I am not completely sure on) a budget from London and all taxes go to the parliament in London. The budget is distributed evenly in correlation with population, infrastructure or needs for money etc.. Only London has control over taxes but if a government (say Scotland for an example) wanted to have control over tax levels they could have a referendum on whether to have control or not.

Unless you want to do something very technical (like broadcast engineering, for which I'd suggest doing an Electronic Engineering degree) you'll often be much better off going the running/apprentice route.

Although I obviously don't run recruitment, I gather that advertised positions are besieged by people with media technology degrees and not enough experience. Bear in mind that most jobs at places that aren't the BBC go via networking / word of mouth.

Look up Skillset. Look up BECTU's south west branch, and go to their networking events. If you're a minority and you're not ethically opposed then shamelessly work that angle. Are you sure you know every TV company in Bristol? There are a lot of them. Trawl industry directories.

Make sure your CV is short, relevant, flawless, non-precocious, and bullshit free. That said, unless you're very lucky, advertised positions will be a challenge. You'll be competing with everyone in the country (a lot of people *are* prepared to move anywhere at the drop of a hat.)

Read all these articles:

They're by someone in your position who took a year out running before going to college, and eventually decided not to go the college route.

All that said, be aware that TV companies are notorious for exploiting unpaid labour, with the prospect of a job forever dangled after the next commission. BECTU are good on advice if you find yourself in that position.

If you do decide to do the MA, find out a lot about it. £9k is a lot of money. The golden question is if they arrange serious work placements, at companies that have actually produced anything for broadcast (avoid corporate video makers, if possible, unless they produce outstanding work) On top of that query contact time, staff/student ratios, number of assessed pieces of work (more is better), quality and vintage of equipment (if it's a 3 camera PAL studio/a cupboard of Sony X1s and FCP 9 macs then run). Etc. 

Finally, being shackled to Bristol will severly impede you. I have friends who've moved continents for a good job, let alone London. It's not impossible, but you'll have to be good.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"I joined the RAF in 1997, at a time when it was illegal for homosexuals to serve. I was 18 and I'd never met a gay person in my life, at least I didn't know I had, I didn't care about who slept with whom and I still don't. 

There was a bit of a worry from some quarters before the change came in 2000, there were people suggesting there would have to be a 'pink barracks', to keep the gays away from us straights, that then led into discussions about certain bases having rules banning single males and single females from being in each others' barracks, because we couldn't have the gays being able to have sex with each other but the straights not, could we? Or what if we did share barracks with the gays, what about the shared showers in some barracks? They might bum us to death or something while we bent over for the soap, I guarantee sales of soap on a rope in the NAAFI went up for a very short while. 

In the end it was all a bit of a to do about nothing. I don't remember there being any major change, except for a few people coming out who we didn't expect to and having a good laugh about it over a beer or several. We still have a lot of male/female split accommodation, but things are a lot more relaxed on the sex front, which is a good thing IMO. Oh and I've probably showered with more gay guys than a lot of gay guys by now. 

I think the thing that really helped us was the fact that you do have to have a bit of a thick skin in the first place to join the military, and a sense of humour about pretty much everything. There are still gay jokes told, the gay guys give better than they get in those regards actually, and on the whole the British military is an example to others how sexual preference has nothing to do with someone's ability to fight a war. 

I know there have been cases of bullying etc in our armed forces, I've seen stories on the BBC over the years, you will never get away from that, but there will always be twats in all walks of life and the same goes for in the armed forces, we can and do try to keep them out but we're not perfect and we never will be. 

Our armed forces has transformed and I still don't give a flying fuck who the bloke next to me sleeps with really, although I have met his boyfriend and he's a nice guy too, and he's not tried to bum me either, shock horror!

I should note at the end that this is my own experience of changes since 1997, speaking specifically as a member of the RAF, members of the Royal Navy and the Army may have their own points of view, but this is how I've seen things change in my own world since 1997.

Salmond maintains that the use of the sterling will be continued, although the Bank of England, now making decisions mostly for England, will set interest rates. And Salmond says the Bank of England will talk to Scotland, now another sovereign nation, about these decisions? Pigs will fly. 
And he says that his long-term goal is Scotland in the Eurozone - so power on monetary terms will be shifted to Brussels - who will probably be in the least sympathetic towards Scotland, now just a small country in Northern Europe.

All this from someone who was so cocksure of RBS's stability, which is not surprising considering the fact that he used to work there. No wonder he's so silent on the subject of banks.

if someone can form coherent sentences with correct spelling, syntax, ""essential"" punctuation needed to achieve that and know the difference between youre and your then odds are they know how to add an apostrophe to such words... *it would take a deficient person not to recognise that*.

now, apart from not being able to recognise that, resorting to being a grammar monkey in the first place also suggests you feel a need to convince others of your ""superior"" intellect and that that is the only way you can do it. trust me... adding an apostrophe to words like you're, i'll, it's and that's does not show youre intelligent and neither does capitalising appropriately.

grammar monkey-ing merely makes you look desperate to feel superior and *if thats the only way you can do it you probably need to take a closer look at yourself*...

The character I want to return most, though, is the Master. I had this great idea of how it would happen.

The Master regenerates as a female, and loses his memory (again).
He/she stays with the Doctor for most of the season, but there's always something off about him/her. Near the end of the season (read: last two or three episodes) she dies, and regenerates as a man while the Doctor is crying. A stopwatch falls out of his pocket, he opens it, and steals the TARDIS and is evil again. Doctor stops him, but not without telling him his true name (Fall of the Eleventh) and somehow takes the Silence down with him.

If it was possible I wouldn't mind a more subtle multiple doctor episode where the 11th Doctor has to sneak through the background of a previous adventure of each incarnation doing subtle things to help them out but never actually interacting with his past selves, kind of like that Star Trek Deep Space 9 episode where they went back into a Original Series episode by splicing in new footage with the old footage and rebuilding some of the sets. 

That might be difficult though due to the quality of the older episodes (and the black and white originals) as well as a lack of widescreen, but perhaps they could explain it by having the doctor experience the adventures 'virtually' via the TARDIS matrix or something and a malfunction makes things appear in black and white, or 'fuzzy'. They could use body doubles to have the original cast appear out of focus in the background, and perhaps have the surviving actors provide extra voice content.

If it is actually a fight?

To think about: What about third-party observers affecting the angel? (Rhetorical)

Depends if it's 1 v 1 or not. If so, the angel wins. This is because IIRC weeping angels don't blink (and are therefore unaffected by the silents ability to make things forget as they will always see it) and therefore will just wait and then zap/break/kill the silent. This is unless of course he manages to break apart the angel while his eyes are still open. Bear in mind that if he is just in a ring or something similar and he gets around the other side, the angel would just turn around and then take him out. They are stone, not stupid.

—	 Craig Ferguson

I'm not sure really. Overall, I think Doctor Who is more popular. Harry Potter may have had a spurt but bear in mind there are years worth of material for Doctor Who. HP only has a few books, games and movies and maybe a little more. People get bored of HP quicker.

DW also has the advantage of people who watched it previously throughout the past 50 years to add to it. HP only really appeals to a small audience and it only ran for a while whereas DW pretty much appeals to any and all.

Though I would mention that HP fans are probably more outgoing about it (partially due to age?) than DW fans are overall (because here again, DW fans range from all ages so the older ones will be more zipped up about it).

Give it a while though. Unless the HP franchise does anything cool at some point coming up....The HPs will continue falling and the DWs will keep growing.

(One of the troubles with this is that there is a lot of overlap in the younger years of it).

If we are talking about other positions - left-back or right-wing - then YES, it *is* better to gamble big money on a new player. No issue there.

It is unfair to Pacheco that. I don't think it is due to his technical quality only that he didn't get as many games at Rayo. Many more parameters come into play I'm sure and I think it could be done better with a careful management. In fact, he was doing so great in Norwich City. What has gone wrong? Oh and Jonjo has proved his worth in Blackpool, a lower league team, scoring 6 in 10. Ha Ha Ha, it's Blackpool right?

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Why would we end up buying every season? There are plenty of positions where we can develop youngsters, as we already have at least 1 full-time first team player there. From our centre-back, right-back, left midfield/wing, center midfield (Henderson is still technically a youngster), are all places where we have ample opportunities to develop our youngsters. 

Even in left-back, a position you stated where you would choose to strengthen, we have a full-time first team player in Enrique, and a youngster in Robinson. Why else would you choose to strengthen there, unless you think that either Enrique or Robinson is not good enough?

I find myself constantly having to repeat the fact that the attacking midfield position is unique in that we need two first-team players in that position, because of Gerrard's injury problems. This is not a position where the view of having a first-team player play 60 minutes and a back-up fill up the last 30 minutes is viable. This is a position where you have to prepare for the back-up playing full 90 minute games for about a third of the season. 

Dani did good in Norwich? Sure. For 6 matches. Maybe you have an insider pass to Liverpool and Rayo training sessions, but he hasn't shown anything to prove that he is good enough for a first team place. Being better than your peers at 18 doesn't make you better than everyone else above 21, and that's what you need to be a first team player. Jonjo did well at Blackpool. Then he came back, played about 18 or so matches, and did what? Do you remember him making any significant contribution in the 2nd half of last season? Where he turned games around singlehandedly? 

&gt;At the end of the season, we would have a team of failed guinea pigs and paying wages for players playing for other teams.

Your statement was unfair because you used the example of Joe Cole's loan to infer that the club would be doing that with all our players on loan. Our discussion started with me reasoning how having Sigurdsson can benefit the squad in general, since it allows us to have 2 options for the future instead of just 1. I have stated repeatedly that if Rodgers chooses to buy Sigurdsson, it is fairly obvious that he rates Sigurdsson higher than our other back-up options, and that our back-ups are not deemed ready for a full first-team place. Like I said, unless you have an insider pass to Liverpool training sessions, why would you then second-guess the decisions of the manager and coaching staff?

Looks relatively simple to invent a pattern if you knit much (which I don't, unfortunately).  You need four repeating bands - grey, green, grey, brown.  The part I can't help with is how many stitches in each row, and how many rows for each band.  But once you've got that figured out, just repeat until the scarf is long enough.

If you watched a movie and the main character was only called Chuck, and then the credits come around and they list him as Chuck Wood, would you not accept that as his name? I know this is a stretch, but I think that with credits and such listing him as Doctor Who is enough to at least let it slide.

true,cloutier116,martha,Martha,"The difference between your example and Doctor Who is that Chuck is a first name, The Doctor is not.  In fact, The Doctor is more a title than anything else.  It's kind of assumed that anyone who only has a first name given has a last name, so adding a last name is fine.  With The Doctor, it's accepted in story that The Doctor isn't his real name, it's a title which he chose for himself.  Therefore, it can be assumed that he chose it as simply the Doctor (as he has stated himself, when asked for more than just The Doctor), not as Doctor Who or anything else, otherwise he would request to be called whatever name he actually chose.  tl;dr, if his name was Doctor Who, he would tell people to call him that, since he chose the name himself",0,1339042437,null,0,false,0,c4xbnjd,t3_uonro,t1_c4xbnjd,t1_c4xbkn4,null,1429086460,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
