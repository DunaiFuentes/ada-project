The problem with Sturridge is, he's a natural winger with a Strikers mentality.
I know he's normally a striker...but with his incredible speed and the fact that we play 4-3-3...he's never going to play central unless it's a small cup game, or if our main striker is getting rested in a UCL group stage match.

So we have Sturridge who plays winger..and squanders easy opportunities sometimes, due to having that selfish striker mentality. If he learns to keep the ball instead of going for impossible chances...and make the obvious passes, he'll be one of the GREATEST.

quote from wikipedia

&gt;A skinhead is a member of a subculture that originated among working class youths in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, and then spread to other parts of the world. Named for their close-cropped or shaven heads, the first skinheads were greatly influenced by West Indian (specifically Jamaican) rude boys and British mods, in terms of fashion, music and lifestyle. Originally, the skinhead subculture was primarily based on those elements, not politics or race.

The neonazi skinheads are just what grabs headlines, the majority of skinheads are decent tolerant people who abhor racism, homophobia, etc.  I was pretty much into the whole skinhead thing when I was younger (clothes, music, etc) and still go to see quite a few of the bands that are still going, like Stiff Little Fingers, Exploited, etc.  Get yourself along to the next SLF gig near you - you'd be hard pushed to find a friendlier crowd :)

People don't save money. In fact they borrow to spend on luxuries and banks are curtailing that. If a fool proof, ethical and unobtrusiveness mechanism to stop piracy emerged tomorrow it wouldn't achieve a damned thing other than maybe move money out of one industry and into another. There is no great windfall awaiting these companies.

At the moment there is this great fantasy that if only we could protect IP then hordes of people will spend money they haven't got. The only thing that will happen with good IP protection is prices will skyrocket and people will spend the same amount of money on less content.

Companies will cut down spending because they'll be able to extract all the money available in this market (which is more or less fixed) on less content because they no longer have to compete with free. Overall culturally it would be a terrible thing. It would particularly be bad for smaller artists who are the ones who'll find themselves cut out.

It doesn't really affect me either way as I don't listen to much music and don't watch many films. People are seriously misreading it if they think curtailing piracy does anything good for legitimate consumers. Or for small artists.

That is the raw economic case. I rather focus on the ethical issues of proposed legislation but even if there were none it wouldn't be a good idea to curtail piracy. It is at best neutral.

Liverpool was the biggest club in England going into the 90's and should have been amazingly well positioned to take advantage of the inception of the Premier League and all the marketing and TV money that was available. However instead of turning themselves into a global brand like Man Utd, they chose to make excuses and maintain the bootroom and family club atmosphere. Now this atmosphere is great for the players when they come (they always say so, even when they leave) but given that football is a money game, it means that we haven't been able to compete for 20 years. Man Utd can spend £20-30m a season on players because they created such a powerful brand that the money has poured in ever since - the biggest club stadium, huge fan base etc. They may have a hell of a lot of debt, but the revenues are there. 
Liverpool on the other hand have only just about gotten their act together following at least a decade of mismanagement which the fans have bought into, citing tradition etc. Tell me Man Utd doesn't have history or tradition. They used it to their advantage. This is the same attitude that leads people to dismiss Mourinho. They believe that they are somehow better than that, that there's a right way to do things. Sure, you can be a complete gentleman and a great guy, but look where Wigan are under Roberto Martinez. This attitude has to change and until the fans, the owners and everyone around the club are hell bent on winning at all costs, we won't get close to the league title because that is what you have to be nowadays, not just in football but in all businesses. Honestly i'd respect the club more because it shows they mean business and are not content with basking in past glories, in an ageing stadium, clinging to the fact that we've won more European Cups than Man Utd until we can't even do that because they'll have overtaken us.",0,1327344152,null,0,false,0,c3ju5qf,t3_osy4e,t1_c3ju5qf,t1_c3ju084,null,1428225849,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Creating mobile launchers has been done in the past, but as an island nation these launchers' missiles are range limited by the size needed to be mobile.

A submarine based deterrent has the advantage of missiles being large enough to get to most places and the entirety of the oceans to hide in so the chances of being found and destroyed are negligible.

I should have been a bit more clear about the point I was making. I'm saying that it is mistaken to link geography with nationality or identity. I would not tell someone from Georgia that they were Eurasian, or someone from Northern Ireland that they were Irish, or someone from ROI that they were British, or someone from the Western suburbs of Istanbul that they were European, because each of those statements carry political meaning. To insist on defining them in that way is to deliberately conflate geography with political identity, which is mischievous. To say someone from Cork is British is clearly not some innocent reference to that person being born or located on an archipelago off the North West coast of continental Europe traditionally known as the British isles, but rather a passive-aggressive way of goading them as to the legitimacy of their independence from the UK.

&gt; If Scotland becomes independent, what would you suggest the inhabitants of Great Britain are called if not British?

If Scotland becomes independent, why is it necessary to have a name for people from Great Britain? What will happen is that British continues to be associated with the United Kingdom (now of England, Wales and NI rather than Great Britain and Northern Ireland). This will not be perfectly consistent, but such is life. It was not consistent to stop calling Irish people British either. We're not going to call each other UKers.

true,Cyc68,null,null,"&gt;No but when you look back at literature, poetry, and probably to a lesser extent songs (more often those of a Rebellious nature) it is commonly referred to as Gold.

That's why I referred to it as a literary convention, rather than a statement of fact. Poets can call it gold until the cows come home, it's still orange, [precisely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ireland#Design_and_symbolism) Pantone PMS 151 or Hex [#FF7900](http://www.colorcombos.com/colors/FF7900).

&gt;I know many tri-colours may look slightly yellow through worn colours, but there are those who actively place a yellow colour within the flag to discourage the ""Orange"" nature behind the meaning.

Irrelevant. The fact that orange can fade to yellow or that some people alter the flag has no bearing on its true colours. The Department of the Taoiseach's [guidelines for use of the flag](http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Youth_Zone/About_the_Constitution,_Flag,_Anthem_Harp/The_National_Flag-PDF.pdf)[PDF] state clearly that it should not be misrepresented with shades of yellow and that worn flags should not be displayed.

&gt;If we really want to go back to the ""Bourbon Dynasty"" the official Irish flag was actually a Gold Harp on a dark blue flag. Not a hint of green nor orange.

Irrelevant. In 1775 the official US flag was a snake on a yellow background with ['Don't Tread On Me'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_flag) written underneath. This doesn't mean that the current US flag is not red, white and blue. Also I am not aware of a blue flag with a gold harp but [a green flag with a gold harp was in use from 1642](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ireland#History).",0,1327347760,null,0,true,0,c3juvdd,t3_orqw7,t1_c3juvdd,t1_c3jugpm,null,1428226185,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

The so-called English ""Golden Generation"" (Lampard, Gerrard, Terry, Ca$hley, Ferdinand, Scholes, Beckham, Crouch, Glen Johnson, etc.) are all beginning to fade, and there isn't a whole lot coming up behind them.

Now, this is not including someone like Rooney who could improve the team. And while it's a squad with loads of talent, there is a lot left to be desired too. There's a lot of rebuilding to be done, and the team is going to have to build it's identity from scratch.

If you were Redknapp, would you leave this Tottenham side for a rebuilding stage in England's history?

The stunning pinnacle of their idiocy came when I first joined them. They cancelled my original order without telling me the day before it was due to activate because they couldn't take over the line in my flat, despite their own line checker saying they could. This meant I had to book in an engineer's appointment, and in doing so they placed a new order for me. They originally wanted to charge me for a new line installation, as the order wasn't placed online, however I managed to get this waived after pointing out that it wasn't placed online because of their idiocy.

The new order, unbeknownst to me at the time, did not include broadband, despite my original order doing so. Their order status page said my order was for a calls package only, so I called up to query this, MULTIPLE times. Every time, they said it would be fine, I would be provisioned for broadband on xyz date, my order was for a calls and broadband package.

xyz date came. The broadband wasn't provisioned. It was never ordered. They finally told me this on the day of the scheduled activation, exactly too late for me to do anything whatsoever about it. Their reply was to offer me a month of free service. After complaining to the CEO (their complaints team are fucking useless, by the way - the CEO is the only way to go if you want your complaint to be actually examined) this was bumped up to about £50, which didn't even cover the cost of the time off work I'd had to take, and included £20 to replace an Amazon voucher they said I couldn't have because the order they placed to replace my online order because they fucked up wasn't placed online.

Then, after doing everything in their power to evade having to hold themselves to the terms of a contract that they themselves wrote, they tried to claim money they legitimately owed me as a refund for a service I could never have possibly used was a ""gesture of goodwill"", after instead of refunding me what was owed plus a small amount of compensation for their utter cretinousness as promised they just zeroed the account instead, thus also erasing my refund. Fuck them. Fuck them to fucking death. I hope they all fucking die. PASS THE FUCKING VALIUM, IT'S ALL FLOODING BACK.

tl;dr fuck Infinity, BT are cunts.

EDIT: Oh and honourable mention for still billing me for broadband after I had switched both my phone line and broadband to O2's LLU service, thus rendering it physically impossible for them to still provide it to me, and then trying to insinuate that this was somehow my fault because I hadn't supplied O2 with a MAC code (which I had, even though as I was switching to an LLU product this was unnecessary and therefore totally irrelevant) and that I actually owed them the money. I don't usually rant down the phone at call centres, but I made an exception for this, coming as it did after I was very much at the end of my fucking tether with that bunch of useless fucking cretins and was just waiting for them to fuck off out of my life forever.

O2, for what it's worth, are a breath of fresh air. I will probably propose to them one day. Seriously, they're a great company to deal with.

In other parts of the country (including the cabinet serving where I temporarily live in Reading) this takes much longer. I moved into this place in Reading in July, the cabinet has only just been turned on.

Superfast Cornwall's information isn't that good because they only get what BT was telling them. They told me I couldn't get fibre, despite BT's own checker saying I could and that I had placed an order. Days later an engineer turned up and installed it.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"But every argument against lesbians having IVF can be used for heterosexual couples. Heterosexual couples can adopt, the woman or man can just have sex with someone else.

&gt;they are most likely perfectly capable of getting children.

But they aren't perfectly capable of getting their own children because of the fact they're in a same-sex relationship.


&gt;in that if a healthy heterosexual couple wanted fertility treatment, they would be refused as it is unnecessary, dangerous and a waste.

i think the issue lies that a lesbian couple cannot produce a baby that is theirs because of the lack of a male in the relationship. To just tell them to have sex with someone doesn't cut it. That's not what they want to do and it's unethical to expect lesbians to have sex with men in order for them to have children. There is a difference between a healthy heterosexual couple and a healthy lesbian couple in regards to fertility and whether or not they should get the treatments. I think they should get the same treatments an infertile heterosexual couple could get (probably excluding surrogacy because there will be little chance of the need for a 3rd woman to carry the child)

&gt;Obviously, if the lesbians were actually incapable of producing offspring in the 'conventional' way then they would be as eligible as everyone else in the same situation.

Lesbians are incapable of producing offspring unless they have sex with a male outside of their relationship. Something i doubt very many of them would want to do, and something i wouldn't wish on anyone.

1) He has his teams play far too defensively for me (and I know you can say that Real Madrid scores lots of goals but honestly it is hard for them not to with Ronaldo, Ozil, di Maria, Kaka, Higuain, etc. in the lineup). I love our free-flowing attacking play that 'Arry encourages, even if it gives us less than desirable results from time to time.

2) Too often he and his teams have been caught up in controversial on-the-pitch moments, such as verbally assaulting the refs, pinching the cheek/eye of assistant coaches, taking cheap shots and making highly dangerous tackles on players.

true,[deleted],null,null,"When you say ""less built up areas"" do you mean on a road, or town/village level?

I don't think town/village size matters: 

* I live in a village of ~2000 and I got it when I said I did. 

* I live next to a village of ~2000 which was one of the first 5 places to get it, and another village which was also one of the first 5.

* I live near Cornwall's largest town (larger than Truro), which got it at the same time I did.

* I'm less aware of how things are going in the likes of Truro and other towns but I believe it's available in some parts of those places too.

On a road level they might target larger roads (or more accurately cabinets serving more premises) first. My road is the only place in the village to have fibre so far, and it is probably the longest road in the village with a cabinet serving the most premises. My road doesn't have particularly bad ADSL speeds (I could get the full 8Mbit) so I don't think that is a factor either.

Seems more like pot luck than size.

Another interesting point is in that large town, BT elected to get all teh cabinets installed before ""turning on"" the town. This meant that cabinets were being installed as early as the start of last year. But in the case of my village they only did my road before declaring my village as having fibre (""in some areas"").",0,1327354767,null,0,true,0,c3jw61p,t3_ost91,t1_c3jw61p,t1_c3jw451,null,1428226875,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Dear WBAGNR,

&gt;As I am sure you already know SOPA, and PIPA that are currently being debated in the United States would effectively close down the free internet entirely, using the excuse of protecting Copyright. Nikki Sinclaire MEP does not support the American Government  making this more and more questionable move and is completely against any similar legislation in Europe.

&gt;The EU soon will be debating the ACTA Treaty which like the SOPA and PIPA threatens the exchange of knowledge and information on the Internet; in any and all circles where the information could be deemed to be someone else's 'property'. We believe itself should not exist in any form. It is a catastrophic violation of individual private property, and so we will oppose ACTA when the final bill comes up for vote in the European Parliament. These proposals only adds to the growing already very BIG list of reasons why'd we'd be better off out the EU !!
 
&gt;No-one would disagree with the need to oppose and control infringement of IP/Copyright, but ACTA is not the way to go about this.  ACTA like SOPA and PIPA criminalises the general population and strangles innovation and freedom of speech and expression.

 
&gt;Kindest Regards

I don't think the networks block encrypted chat clients. There's one called Gibberbot which is early release still, but looks promising.

Torres was playing well with the other's around him, should we bench him just because he was only okay against Norwich? IMO yes finishing is an immediate need, but if our front 3 can develop chemistry it will help us in the long run. 3.  I think Mata and Malouda have a good connection. Malouda setup Mata for 2 plays in which we could have scored against Norwich. My thinking was to see those two play near each other. 4. After the way Luiz played against Norwich I think he deserves a start. Cahill can sub in.

On top of that I had the gas, electric and water to pay, after I paid for food I had nothing left.

I originally applied for DLA when I first fell ill and the doctor who came out to assess me screwed me over, they even canceled my income support, I was left for 6 months with nothing until the appeal went to court and I won. That period of my life was horrible.

The notion people are scamming the benefits system is ridiculous, it's impossible to get DLA, the doctors who assess you lie, I've had 4 separate assessments since I fell ill and 3 of those doctors lied, the last one didn't because she came out after I made a complaint (which was upheld) against the doctor who saw me before her, the first doctor made comments such as ""he chooses to live a disabled life style"" saying I'm the fault of my own disability (I suffer from a neurological disorder)

I can live relatively comfortably now with the extra I get from DLA but I went 6 years without getting anything due to fear of what happened in 2004 happening again, 6 years disabled with no money, no new clothes, having to rely on family for things like sofas.

true,jawnn,lfc12,,"Personally, I think you just took a shit on Liverpool as a whole. 

For starters, United's revenues ""being there"" don't really mean anything to me - a global brand? Yeah, that's what they are. Nike's bitch, a global BRAND. Liverpool FC is a club, not a brand. You mention the debt, revenues are useless if they're in there to keeping you paying the minimums of your debt forever. What 'excuses' were made, and why do you make the bootroom and 'family club atmosphere' out to be a bad thing? Is it preferably to soulless financial doom and placing business, profits and merchandising above the actual sport we love in the first place? To what end would you seek success, really, that you essentially seem to aspire to be more like United as a club..?

""...a decade of mismanagement which the fans have *bought into, citing tradition etc*"" - huh? What are you trying to say here, and when did this become a comparison of United's history to ours..? huhhhh?

People dismiss Mourinho not because of his capabilities in the sport but because of the way he carries himself and the means in which he'll use to obtain success. People who support this club generally frown upon it. Flicking the eye of the opposing ref as our side crowds around the ref in the 92nd minute because one of our players dove and everyone has to get out of hand? Are you kidding me? Why would anyone want petty, childish antics like that here? Right now, it sounds like you're comparing Kuyt to Balotelli. Guess which shirt I and most people here have/would have.

""Somehow"" we are better than that? It's not really 'somehow' as much as it is you're talking about franchising and back end things as of Mourinho is more than the manager. He manages the squad, and what severedfragile said above is probably the unanimous opinion of him. Sure, he's a winner, but he's a fking scumbag winner IMO. I love Xabi, but IMO he's dead to me because he actually takes Mourinho's instructions to literally WASTE time and act like it's not intention. Because that guy breeds bad football, I don't care if it's winning or losing; it's BAD football and cups mean nothing to me if we didn't earn them. You may believe in 'winning at all costs' but you would never have heard of Liverpool if that's what the important people in our club's history believed. There are always costs, and to put another footballers health; to put honor and loyalty to the game behind you in search of wins..that's just shallow.  

I'm not trying to start any sort of argument or fight or anything, but if you'd respect the club more because we're ""showing we mean business"" by cheating, hurting people, super-embellishing and acting like pre-teens throwing tantrums, then maybe LFC just isn't for you. I don't want that here, I don't know why anyone would. If you view your fellow supporters as 'not meaning business', 'basking in past glories' and 'clinging' to anything - than your opinions are tragically low and I think it's *you* who be in search of a new club, not Kenny or Mourinho.

I don't think anyone at Liverpool makes excuses for anything, nobody is satisfied unless we're winning. When we are, we always want to win by more. I think you're just running out of patience and forgetting what we're actually about, because it ain't Mourinho.

I thought it was a great and intricate plot full of Gallifreyan culture. It is the majority who consider origin stories too revealing, so I get where you're coming from. But Doctors like McCoy or scenes like the end of Family of Blood still give me chills up the spine and wonder in awe about the vast and terrible secrets of the Doctor- so I guess Lungbarrow couldn't have ruined the Doctor's mystery for me if I felt that way.

I mean it's not all about the origins is it? Sure it may explain where the Doctor came from, but isn't what he's done more important than his background?

Most origin stories like in comics pretty much tell the character's motivations, insights, and history that explains who they are today, but I don't think Lungbarrow really explained who the Doctor really is or his inner thoughts, just how he was born. He keeps changing all the time so his origins can never truly explain the essence of his being.

It's like that in Queens too, but some neighborhoods there are far more mixed. One neighborhood, Astoria, probably has residents from every nation on earth, or damn close to it. 

Quick geography lesson: both Brooklyn and Queens are attached to, and technically part of, Long Island. But never called somebody from the city proper as being from Long Island. They're the black sheep of the family.

The Bronx, to the north, has some of the poorest congressional districts in the country, with rich folk in the north of the county. Staten Island...we don't really talk about Staten Island. They're the ginger step-sibling of the other 4 boroughs.

Since when does one situation count as extensive use? Don't bring RTD into this. Moffat is the only one who has made silly claims about what is canon and what isn't.

The BBC makes stories canon by committing them to film, and then airing them to millions of people as part of an ongoing series. They do it by creating books, comics, and audio stories featuring the same characters in the same universe. That's what official canon *is*.

Moffat has introduced this nonsense idea that none of it matters, and you can decide whatever you want (which really, applies to every other work of fiction.). But you don't need someone to tell you that every episode of 24 takes place in the same universe as the previous episode. You just assume it, because that's how television works. You don't need an executive to remind you every few episodes ""Oh yea, the events from season 1 still happened. Just in case you thought, arbitrarily, that they didn't.""

We don't need them. It makes much more sense to have our nuclear missiles hidden underwater in British waters than it does to have launch sites dotted around the countryside. 

Our deterrent is that we always have at least one of our four Trident submarines at sea at any one time. The deterrent side of it is that only a few people know where they patrol so they really could be anywhere. When at sea, most of the crew don't even know where they are. It's very difficult to defend against something if you don't know where it is.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.",0,1327382138,null,0,false,0,c3k1cft,t3_otzqb,t1_c3k1cft,t3_otzqb,null,1428229310,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Take the ""crime"" of buggery for example. Do you honestly think that would still be a thing if the Tories were in power rather than Labour? Ridiculous. As it socially became less taboo it would have been left by the wayside. It was a social change not one brought on by political ideals.

A couple of things which were completely manufactured by a political party, on the other hand, are the current welfare state (which is a joke) and dragging us further into the E.U (halted only by public opposition).

I have a friend who has worked maybe 3 jobs since leaving school, none longer than 3 months. He is now 24 and literally hasn't worked since 19.

He has his own 1 bedroom house, nice enough by any standards, with all rent and bills paid for. Ok so he doesn't live a extravagant lifestyle with money coming out of his ears but he is confertable and happy that's for sure.

He always has food in the cupboard. Internet and Xbox live, plus virgin tv, which is great because he generally spends every day in the house. He basically has it down to a system now where any time he is required to go to the job centre for assessment he ""forgets"" his papers or is late etc. He still comes to the pub a few times a month and is generally content.

The job centre have told him he needs to do something with himself so now he has signed onto their enterprise scheme where they will help you set up you're own business and give you initial funding. I was speaking to him about it the other day and he was telling me it was all going well and he only had a couple of meetings left. His business idea is actually terrible and won't make any money but after asking him more about it he said he wasn't that bothered because if it failed he can just sign on the dole again....

Oh he also has 2 kids who he pays nothing for. The one he isn't allowed to see but did decided to try and get access to her, all for free of corse. When told his funding for this was being cut he said ""ah well, I guess I won't be seeing her then""

He was unemployed until one day he happened to mentioned to someone at the job centre (or whatever they're called these days) that he couldn't do jobs involving heavy lifting because he didn't have full mobility in his shoulder.  This was from a BMX accident a few weeks before, serious but not permanent.  Within a week or two he had been taken off unemployment benefit and switched to disability allowance.  I think he actually ended up with more money as a result.  So this ""disabled person"" who was ""unable to work"" (by their definition, not his) spent his days riding BMX instead.  He didn't set out to cheat the system, but when he was offered more money for being ""disabled"" instead of ""unemployed"" he took it.  It made no difference to him what label they put on him.  But had we read about him in the paper, claiming his disability benefit while being an active sportsman, we would have had no doubt that he was benefit cheat.  He also mentioned that he wasn't the only one in his group of friends who was officially ""disabled"" instead of being ""unemployed"" so it wasn't an isolated incident.

So while I don't dispute the fact that you're not getting the support you need, it's wrong to say that the system isn't being abused.  However, I suspect that most of the abuse is (or was) political in nature and implemented with the short-term goal of improving the unemployment figures.

Required teaching - (*I got going again... sorry*) Of course and it is already done so, or advised in any case. The whole ""don't feel pressured"" message has been around for years. But the fact that this would be ""required"" is the very point it needs to be blocked at this stage: as it stands *nothing* is expressly required to be taught about sex ed! Schools/teachers can teach all or nothing. A good many schools (*cough* faith schools *cough*) don't teach anything really, particularly not sensible contraception. This bill would have meant that *every* school would teach about abstinence, regardless of what else they do (or do not) teach about sex ed. Essentially that would mean that all some children are taught is abstinence, hence the mentions of abstinence only. Apols if I repeated myself from above, but I haven't re-read it.

I don't think that the family atmosphere is a bad thing presay, as I mentioned the players in general seem very happy with the atmosphere around the club, with the exception of the Hicks and Gilett reign. I think that it has held us back though and there has been an obsession with doing things a certain way, which may have worked in the 70s and 80s, but don't work now. 

Regarding Mourinho being a scumbag. The whole carnival around the Barca v Real matches has become ridiculous and tiresome. Watch the match from last week, both team squabbling at every decision, both teams diving and spending 5 minutes rolling around after every tackle. Ok, Madrid have tried to strongarm Barca, but they tried to outplay them and got beaten 5-0. Sometimes you have to do what it takes. When Mourinho was in England, apart from the media circus around him, which for the most part bred success for his team, he wasn't like this - I think it is much to do with managing in Spain. I don't think he would necessarily bring the same attitude over here.

The final thing I would say is look at Bill Shankly's quotes:

If you are first you are first. If you are second you are nothing. - that sounds like someone prepared to win at all costs.

If Everton were playing at the bottom of the garden, I'd pull the curtains. - When Rafa called Everton a small club he was lambasted, but it's a great quote from Shanks, how perceptions change

Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that. - sums up his attitude in general.

Its shameful; a once proud nation that used to warm our teapots and let them collect tannins for generations has been reduced to this world of crap tea.

You go to almost any cafe, ask for a tea, and its some tea bag in a cup with UHT milk shit for £1.75. What's so hard about adding a tea pot? With coffee they have these fucking complex machines that have 100 buttons and take 3 minutes and a team of trained coffee engineers to operate. You have to grind beans and do all sorts of difficult shit. Why can't they just have a kettle and a tea pot next to it? It wouldn't be hard and the quality of the drink would improve drastically. 

Tea doesn't have to be some pretentious lifestyle choice, but taking time and doing something properly... why not? Do we not work ourselves to the bone day in day out? Do we not deserve 5 minutes to brew followed by a 10 minute conversation? Don't believe the marketing; if you try to make tea fast you might as well not make it at all.

I am also going to go on a bit because I feel obliged to try and counteract a lot of the propaganda flying about at the moment that people are starting to believe. So bear with me and strap in.

&gt;Unfortunately people like you are paying the price of the previous government's attempts to improve the unemployment figures and the current government's heavy handed attempts to remedy that.

Whatever happened to your friend this was not as a result of national policy under the last Labour or indeed the previous Tory government. I have been in the trade since 1992 so have seen a few things come and go, then come back again. Blaming Labour for this one is a myth being actively pushed by the current Tory government as a fake justification for their cuts. Unofficial local policies might have varied so I am not saying it did not happen to your friend, but the right people should be blamed. The last time a government actively pushed people off dole onto sickness was under Thatcher. Peter Lilley (a Tory, Major government) reversed this policy back in 1995 with the introduction of Incapacity Benefit to get people off sick and back on the dole (sorry, into gainful employment). Labour actually made the regime a lot tougher with Employment &amp; Support Allowance. The problem with both of these benefits was that they assumed that most people off sick were wagging it and they ran into a hard wall of genuine claimants that they were not expecting. I have spent a large part of the last two decades dealing with the damage to disabled people caused by this push, which has come from both parties.

Was his 'disability allowance' called Disability Living Allowance or Incapacity Benefit/Employment &amp; Support Allowance? It matters because only DLA is a label for disability. It is also only for long-term disability, not short to medium term injuries, and is an 'in-work' benefit so he would not have automatically come off 'unemployment benefit' (Jobseekers?) and could in fact have claimed it if he had a job. If this happened after 1995 it sounds like he actually got either Incapacity Benefit, or more recently, Employment &amp; Support Allowance. These are 'sickness' benefits designed for incapacity for work, not 'disability' benefits, and would automatically have taken him off Jobseekers as you say. There has been a lot of deliberate muddying of the waters on the distinction by the  government, allowing the long-term disabled to be tarred with the same brush as feckless scroungers pulling a sickie in the run up to the current round of cuts.

The problem is that he would have needed a GP sick note to claim and would eventually have had to attend a DWP medical. It is very plausible that his GP would have signed him off for a few weeks to be helpful and to allow recuperation time, but he would never have scored the needed 15 points on the DWP medical with just a shoulder injury so he could not have claimed long-term without some other problem. How long was he actually on 'disability allowance' for? My bet is that it was a local coincidence of helpful advisers at the Job Centre and GPs thinking that they were being helpful and that he was signed off for a few months at most. Does this seem to match what happened? Fuck knows but I never met that many helpful advisers myself in our local Job Centres. Most of the front desk staff would never have offered any useful advice and most of the back room staff seemed very keen to get people off sickness benefits as fast as they could possibly do it.

**tl:dr** Data is not the plural of anecdote and we are operating in a propaganda-rich environment so be careful of extrapolating, but it is plausible that your friend and his friend were signed off sick for a few weeks or months when perhaps they should not have been. This did not make them officially 'disabled'.

Basically he argues that because we work every day doing things we don't like because its ""the done thing"" the hardest working among us resent *anyone* that doesn't follow this lifestyle.

Its common to cover up unhappiness and instead of dealing with the issues that that causes you rationalise your destructive behaviour. This works on both sides of the class spectrum: the rioters that burn shops in their own community because they don't like ""rich"" people and the middle managers that work 60 hour weeks that hate ""benefit scroungers"" and other people ""taking their taxes"" and doing 'nothing' all day.

I think a lot of people do this instead of getting depressed. I've heard people say, speaking about depressed friends, ""why doesn't he just get over his depression? Or go out and get drunk?"" some people have the mentality to ""just get on"" with things that are actually driving themselves slowly into a life they never really wanted. Whilst not a clinical issue this creates a social structure filled with mistrust and envy because ""If I'm not allowed a good life why should other people"". Depressed people that recover often realise that the reason why they were depressed is because they were allowing themselves to feel some kind of personal guilt for not liking the life that *everyone* else chooses.

So the word is kind of ours, a specific sauce was, but the general practice and many of the dishes aren't.  Then there are some dishes which were made first in the UK, often by subcontinental immigrants, to cater to the British palate - thus tikka with gravy became tikka massala, and competitions for a hotter curry led to [tindaloo](http://www.indiacurry.com/chicken/chickentindaloo.htm) and [phall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phall).

You are so wrong on a scale of wrongness that it is a bit scary to contemplate.

Most of the government debt is in the form of bonds, which you could liken to an interest only loan - in that the government only pays interest on the loan and then has to repay the entire bond at face value at some point in the future - often by issuing new bonds that will also need to be rolled over at some date in the future.

It's actually quite rare for the UK government to pay off any of its debt.

As to who lends the money, very little of it comes from the commercial banks - as in the ones who swapped assets for liquidity via the Bank of England (and all lost a percentage as a haircut).

A lot of the debt is financed by investors, who might use a bank to process the transaction, but it isn't the bank doing the lending.

If the government defaulted, then several things would happen.

A mass panic for a start.

Investors would not lend to the government again - so the government would either have to slash spending, or massively raise taxes. Both would plunge the UK into a long recession.

Confidence across the major western markets would collapse - leading to investor panic across the world.

Interest rates would have to rise to compensate, which would probably push most of the world into recession.

... in other words, a default by the UK government of sovereign debt would be catastrophic.

Fortunately, one of the few decent things the previous government did when piling up the debt was to issue long-term debt, so that the current government is issuing bonds today to cover current spending, and isn't having to issue any rollover bonds - which is the problem that confounds the likes of Greece, Italy and Spain.

The relevant part is

&gt;“Firstly both TVShack websites were entirely in the hands of Richard O’Dwyer and his co conspirators requiring third parties to sign up to TVShack and be vetted before going further,” Judge Purdy said. 

&gt;The judge agreed with John Jones, barrister for the United States government, that “because he was intimately involved in deciding who was allowed to post links on the TVShack websites, which links would be posted”, Mr O’Dwyer’s alleged conduct was a criminal offence under British copyright law. 

&gt;In its argument the defence had cited the 2010 case of TV-Links, a website that offered a similar directory of links to pirated material to TVShack. The judge found it was acting as a “mere conduit” and dismissed the criminal charges against the two men who operated TV-Links.

What tv-links did was not crime, because it just hosted links - it could claim ignorance of what those links were.

I don't know if I'd say that people are only bitter because welfarees aren't opting for the 'done thing', because for a lot of people it isn't optional, but living any lifestyle means committing yourself to it and becoming antipathic to anything else.

Too right, depression is a great analogy. Clinical depression is just the unlivable form of something that many people live with, and they don't want to sympathise because they might have to acknowledge the depressive aspects of their own lives. Welfare is the same thing economically.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"I have been dealing with benefits appeals since 1992 and unfortunately Sugar_Free_orangeade's story rings true and if they have won at appeal then the medical evidence will have been thoroughly tested and found in their favour. However I suspect that at least some of what they experienced as lies were possibly omissions, failure to ask the right questions and the assumption that the claimant was a scrounger. The end result was the same, Sugar_Free_orangeade will have seen several reports that bore no resemblance to their actual difficulties, are effectively lies and will have caused substantial harm.

Benefits Agency Medical Services and ATOS medical reports are notoriously inaccurate and incomplete. Having seen hundreds of sets of appeal papers where I can cross reference these reports with appellants’ medical records and evidence from their consultants, and spent hours talking to appellants and family members that observed the medical examinations I have come across solid evidence of direct lying by doctors working for the DWP. However direct and overt lies, whilst they happen, are not as common as the omissions, misrepresentation, hurriedness, rudeness, lack of care and prejudice that are the stock in trade of a high proportion of these doctors. Many are ignorant of anything to do with mental health problems and frequently misdiagnose based on extremely fragmentary information and an apparent assumption that depression equals malingering. It is not all the doctors, a pattern is apparent and claimants always make unprompted and similar complaints about the same set of doctors and not about others. 12 of them are in fact [under investigation]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/aug/13/atos-doctors-improper-conduct-disability) by the GMC for not putting the care of their patients first. 

If you find hard to accept that doctors would behave like this try thinking of these doctors as being like traffic wardens. What sort of person applies for the job of traffic warden? Some will be decent people but a higher than normal number will be those with a natural inclination to cuntishness. It is the same with these doctors. Having done their medical training, instead of being paid to care for patients they have opted to be paid to judge people. Those that do home visits are local GPs paid per visit in time that other GPs would spend in surgery with their NHS patients. They are not paid by how long it takes to do the job, so they tend to hurry. I have caught them lying on forms about the times that they were at a claimant’s house a number of times. Those that work in-house are directly employed by ATOS so they are under continual quota pressure to refuse benefit and are directed by a computer system that prevents them from asking questions about problems if the claimant didn’t mention that problem right at the start of the interview.

So yes. Lying cunts, some of them, but the medical assessment system is broken, and it is this same system that is being extended in the current Welfare Reform Bill instead of reformed.

So the rich are doing better out of benefits than the poor.

People don't see that bit though. What they see is 'people on benefits get more than average income' assume it applies to most claimants and then they get angry. Put like that it would seem unfair, but by then people are too cross to see the massive distortion. The real aim is not to save the £290 million, though that would be nice.

I can completely sympathise with you.

I had my first heart attack when I was 30, then two more by the time I was 34.  I can walk about 15yds before I have to rest.  Turned down for DLA, lost two appeals and it took a year to get to a tribunal - the tribunal panel were fantastic, took them all of 5 minutes to decide in my favour and said it should never have got to that stage in the 1st place.

ATOS Dr said he performed a physical on me (lie), said I had no 'obeservable mobility problems' - I use two walking sticks and could be overtaken by an arthritic tortoise.  I had supplied the names of my cardio surgeon and vascular surgeon but the DHSS hadn't even bothered to wait for a reply from either of them.

My DLA is up for renewal this september and the rules are changing and frankly, I am fucking shitting myself.  If I lose my DLA then I lose my car - if I have no car then I am housebound again, unable to even walk to the nearest shop or bus stop and will have to rely on my 70yr old father  (who has heart problems himself) to come take me shopping, or wait for weekends when my gf comes over.

As far as RB reserves go, we are like the rest of the world - relatively thin.  Kalas (although he's on loan) has done very well at CB and with his exceptional speed many think he could transition to RB very well. Hutchinson is decent at RB but is probably better suited for CB.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"Did you see the bit about people *richer* than you getting £53 *billion* in benefits. Didn't that raise an eyebrow? That is people with a lot of income being given more. Did you notice that the only benefit cut that Cameron is in favour of reversing is the one that would have taken Child Benefit away from rich people. Boy, the Tories have done a good job framing this debate. Classic divide and rule, they have us fighting amongst ourselves for the scraps. 

Yes, there is a debate to be had about what would be a reasonable upper limit for benefits. But having it in terms of resentment and jealousy is just playing their game and losing. To be clear, to get £26,000 you have to have several children and probably also being claiming some form of disability benefit. So benefits paid above the basic adult minimum are either to feed and clothe children or are for the extra costs of being a disabled person. Which of those would you take away? The kids won't magically go away and neither will the disability. Money paid as Housing Benefit goes to the landlord and is not cash sloshing around in the pockets of claimants to spend.

When we get on to the costs of renting we are getting somewhere that is fruitful for debate. There are ways that this can be tackled, one of which is to limit Housing Benefit. The downside of this is social cleansing and a rise in homelessness. Other ways would be to tackle how much landlords can charge through legislation. The downside to this is that people have business plans and mortgages based on being able to charge high rents. So neither solution is perfect, but why automatically grab for the one that the government dangle under your nose?

There is an incentive in this country to have more children than you can afford to look after. That is a problem.  
&gt;The kids won't magically go away  

True, but until you remove the incentive for people to have too many children, they aren't going to stop appearing either. I don't think it's a good idea to look at disability and child benefits as something totally necessary and will never go away as there is still a lot that can be done.  

Disability benefits too: I know a lot of people get really mad when you talk about this, and what i'm about to say is probably very controversial, but i think a lot of people who claim disability benefits have the capacity to do certain jobs. I know a guy who claims disability benefits who would be perfectly able to work in 80% of jobs. He doesn't have the physical ability to do large amounts of manual labour but is quite capable of shop-work or working on the phone. A wheelchair doesn't make you completely incapable of getting any job (once again i appreciate some disability does.)

He also run's Nina's Mini Market round the corner which is the best off licence in Edinburgh.  One of my favourites but always gets busy.

There's also [Brewdog](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/brewdog-edinburgh) which again has a great selection - bottles are way to expensive but they do great beers on tap.  Different atmosphere, they're more ""hipster"" if I could call it that, though I'm sure they don't like being pigeonholed...But really knowledgeable staff again, always willing to offer advice.

My favourite two are probably [the Bow Bar](http://www.list.co.uk/place/22427-the-bow-bar/) or [Bennets](http://www.list.co.uk/place/13876-bennets-bar/), more traditional and do nice Real Ales but still have an atmosphere.  Also the [Earl of Marchmont](http://www.list.co.uk/place/103181-earl-of-marchmont/)'s good if you happen to be in Marchmont, but it's tiny and busy.  And [Cloisters](http://www.list.co.uk/place/102899-the-cloisters/) and [the Blue Blazer](http://www.bestpubs.co.uk/layout0.asp?pub=105813) are good for traditional ales as well but we can never get a seat when we go in...

[The Holyrood 9A](http://www.list.co.uk/place/103625-the-holyrood-9a/) is good too, nice selection of beers but has more of an after-work, professional vibe.

I also recommend [Lebowskis](http://www.lebowskis.co.uk/) on a Saturday, they have a good folk band on then, and about 20 types of White Russians.

For cocktail bars, the best is by far [Bramble](http://www.bramblebar.co.uk/), not that unreasonably priced either for what you get. [Dragonfly](http://www.dragonflycocktailbar.com/) is also good, even if it doesn't look it from the outside, and [the Cuckoo's nest](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/the-cuckoos-nest-edinburgh) used to be one of my regulars, when it did good cocktails for half the price of the others, but it's got a wee bit more expensive now.

So that's a pretty comprehensive overview of my drinking life...

I'm not a big fan of anything on the Royal Mile or the Grassmarket really (except [the Last Drop](http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/thelastdropgrassmarketedinburgh/), that's quite good) and I don't venture into New Town often enough to know about there, though I hear there are some great pubs that way too.

As for clubbing, not my specialty, but George Street is where the fancy clubs are - the likes of [Opal Lounge](http://www.opallounge.co.uk/), where Prince William used to go apparently, and the visiting rugby teams, etc go.

*Mistaking 'fertility treatment' for 'artificial insemination' would be one. And from there, I'd agree that a heterosexual couple with one partner with fertility problems should take preference over a homosexual female couple where alternative options such as surrogacy could be used, seeing as with the heterosexual couple, it is possible that both partners can still be involved with artificial insemination, whereas with a lesbian couple it has to be one partner no matter what you do. The sexuality doesn't come into it - it just puts biological sets of parents first.
You may not like that answer, but it is a possible alternative to him simply not wanting gay couples to have kids.

Yes you're right that the tricolour represents peace between Catholics and Protestants, but religious distinctions weren't what the IRA's ideology was about; it was the British that they regarded as the enemy, not necessarily Protestants, as there are many Protestants in the South who consider themselves fully Irish and not British. The religious dimension seems to have always been more important to the Loyalists ideology, as you can see lots of Loyalist murals conveying the evils of the Catholicism and indicating that it's a political system, not just a religion. Also members of the Orange Lodge can't attend Catholic funerals, marry Catholics, etc. I never got the impression that the IRA cared about Protestantism as much as they cared about a United Ireland. For example in the quote you quoted: 

&gt; the hands of the **Irish** Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood.

Oh well, carry on. I agree that some people really are stupid enough to have kids to get extra benefits. I'm sure that they are out there. But again that is the single idea being waved around because it gets people riled up. You know how a magician works, with misdirection. ""Ooh look at me waving my hand in the air, but don't look at what I am doing with the other hand."" There are a number of ways to end up with several kids that are not the 'single mum baby-machine' stereotype. For example someone has 2 or 3 kids with their husband. He fucks off. A few years later she marries another divorcee who also has a kid or two. They have jobs so they are not being feckless they think in raising 4 or 5 kids. Bang - redundant. Now what? Someone has to pay for the kids, it's benefits or Social Services and I know which is better for the kids. How is cutting benefits supposed to stop people divorcing and remarrying?

With disability, don't worry I'm not going to get really mad. This is a tricky area. Not least because most people don't get the difference between disability and sickness benefits and the government are happy to add to the confusion. Disability benefits are paid regardless of employment status, in fact a lot of disabled people could not manage to work without their Disability Living Allowance. An old friend of mine works full time, always has, but could never afford the taxis she needs to get to and from work without DLA. I think you mean Incapacity Benefit or Employment &amp; Support Allowance (ESA). The thing is that when ESA was introduced by Labour it was designed to give training, counselling, work experience and support to enable people with long term illnesses who could do some sort of work to move of benefit into work. Those mechanisms are pretty much still sitting there unfunded and not being used. Both Labour and Tories have preferred chasing headlines and trying to drive people off ESA onto the dole rather than doing the hard thing of supporting people to learn how to make changes. 

But there is another set of problems with disability and work. Find a job, get a job, hold down a job. These are all twice as hard for many people with disabilities. There are no jobs around at the minute, so how much harder is it for a disabled person to find a job that they could actually do? They then have to persuade an employer to take them on over an able bodied candidate? Why would the employer take on those costs and risks? The government could offer them incentives I suppose, but that will cost money. Finally if they get a job they may have great difficulty keeping it, especially if their condition is variable and they keep having to take time off work and get fired. How would cutting someone’s benefits sort out any of this?

Simply punishing people in the hope that real problems will go away is not likely to work.

Towards the end of the Tennant days I remember being mad and upset they were going to be changing stuff... then I started watching it. It's better. And I LOVED the Tennant stuff. 

As for reasons, for me, it's all about River. She's really the first person that can really hold their own with the Doctor when it comes to intelligence, wit, and charm while at the same time having a romantic involvement. Rose was great all... but let's be honest, The Doctor was WAAAAAYYYYYY out of her league. River and he are very much equals.

And while you might be able to argue that the very fact of having a character such as river IS ""far from Dr. Who's Roots"" I feel like he has had a longing for such a person for a long long time, certainly as recently as the Tennant days for sure (because ya know... she's actually IN the Tennant days too). So I wouldn't say she is that far from Who roots.

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"I still remain optimistic that he will find good form and prove that he is the player we thought we were buying. He's had a tough run during his time here - first he was injured and lacked fitness, then he has had to deal with sporadic playing time. Now he is having to shoulder the entire goal-scoring load with Suarez being out.

Let's not forget that Andy has hardly gotten to play with our ideal starting XI. Between his injuries and those to Gerrard and Lucas, he's rarely played with our best team. I think he would look a great deal better (and receive less criticism) if he had been playing with Gerrard and Suarez every time. Carroll needs better service than he has been receiving, and Gerrard is one of the best in the business. Gotta think Suarez could create a few chances for him too.

Downing's struggles have hurt Carroll as well. I think it would greatly help if Kenny could pick a single position/role for Stuart and let him settle in for a bit. He's looked great for England so it's clear that he has the ability. 

**tl;dr:** If the entire team was playing well I'd be the first to criticize Carroll, but we've had far too many injuries and goal scoring problems for us to fairly heap all the blame on Andy.

* Equal precedence for corrections: if you post ""Immigration soars causing cancer rates to rise"" You have to publish something along the lines of ""We deliberately mislead you"" In the same size font in the same section of the paper.

* opinion can't be in news section. This is different from bias, the telegraph and guardian are bias often running stories like ""Banker Bonuses increase from last year"" which is true, but is editorialised. There isn't much you can do about bias but, for example, the Mail today said ""Insult to hard working families"" this is bias, but its also an opinion that should be kept as far away from the  front pages as possible.

* Articles can't be shown to directly influence marketing material in any news paper. I don't mean reviews, I mean full fucking page spreads on beauty products right above a massive Oil of Olay product with the article, by pure coincidence, recommending the very product they're trying to sell. 

* Make journalists personally and legally responsible for the words they write and editors personally responsible for articles that are published. I'm tired of hearing tabloid hacks saying ""It was a rogue reporter"" and ""its just the pressure of my job."" 'just doing my job' is about the worst excuse I can think of for causing harm to society.

* Actually enforce the laws, make sure people go to prison. Take away newspapers earnings; not through law suits through taxes. They directly harm society with their lies and twisted morals, its an insult that they can profit from it.

* Limit the size of any media empire - this isn't about what people buy, we can't and shouldn't control that, its about what individuals own.

One thing I can comment on is her age and attractiveness. I think one of the primary faults I had with the new series was that the companions were all young and pretty, and that this seemed to be the prerequisite for being a companion. This tended to diminish their role, and in the case of Martha her crush on the doctor severely impaired meaningful character development. Basically, everyone up till Donna was a quasi-girlfriend to the doctor. This is not, in my mind, what a companion should be or at least not what one has to be.

true,davegod,null,null,"Edinburgh's a bit awkward in some ways in that there's loads of decent places but it's hard to make a recommendation of something excellent, at least without knowing exactly what you're after and whereabouts you're thinking of going. There's also something pretty decent everywhere (for food or drink anyway) so there's rarely anywhere so much better that it's worth going far for.

There are very good (and many) pubs everywhere, good food just about everywhere, the good cocktail bars are dotted about though, the ""clubs"" are almost exclusive to George St (dress codes aren't very strict), but there's almost nothing by way of true nightclub - instead you get bars rammed with amateur drinkers open until 3am. 

Everywhere you'd want to go is about the centre and walkable or short taxi. Pretty much [these areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edinburgh_map.png), plus maybe Newington/Bridges (south/east of old town, somewhat upmarket as student areas go). Broughton St in the top-right of New Town has some really good pubs, though you might want to firstly size up whether it's a venue for confirmed bachelor(ette)s. 

Someone mentioned Sea Dogs restaurant, there's also the original [Dogs](http://www.thedogsonline.co.uk/) on Hanover St. (very central, just off George St). If you want steak, there's Los Argentos in Newington area - great steak, forget the veg and slightly comedic service. 

[Cambridge Bar](http://www.thecambridgebar.co.uk/) on Young St (again just off George st) is a small pub that does good burgers and good beer - small range but good if you're a real-ale type and kept very well. Currently on tap I'd recommend Goldeneye or IPA. Tends to be very busy serving the after-work crowd but OK other times.

Actually this is hopeless, Edinburgh's really spoilt for good pubs and decent food, the tricky bit is the really good ones that are near where you are and fit what you're looking for. If you're doing pub crawl, well there's pubs everywhere but the traditional crawls are either Rose St (parallel to George St) or Grassmarket.

For cocktails, someone mentioned Bramble, and a few others, suspect he needs to visit the [Raconteur](http://www.theraconteuredinburgh.com/). Bit expensive and out of the way but take the diversion if you do hit Stockbridge. 

Non food or drink activities are a bit sparser. Obviously the castle is obligiatory - not actually that great other than the view but pretty much has to be done. National Museum is quite near the castle, as is the National Gallery, neither of which you'll spend that much time in but they're free and you can tell parents how cultured it all was. Oh, utterly obligiatory, just for the cliche, walk up Arthur's Seat. The dungeons are really popular with tourists though not sure how well they'd go down amongst 20/30 year olds.

Register with a few agencies as LLs will only have their properties listed with one, maybe two different agencies at once, so you can get the biggest selection of property options.

From my own research (I am also looking for somewhere to move to at present) you should be able to get a VERY nice place for 2 with that sort of budget. But it always good if you do some research on [Rightmove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/) or something similar to get an idea of what your money buys.

As for which agencies to enquire to, I am not sure. Try going for ones that are not large franchises and go for the smaller independents. These they generally offer a better service and better rates. As a LL I would advise staying away from Bairstow Eves / Countrywide if you do go to a letting agency. Both myself, my tenants and people I know in the industry have had very bad experiences with them.

I think that the media criticism that LFC and its supporters have been overly ""tribal"" in their support of Suarez is off base. The fuck were we supposed to do, abandon one of our own while he continues to maintain his innocence? Our motto, our credo, our anthem, our *soul* as a club is YNWA for fuck's sake. And, when he comes back, I'm sure supporters of other clubs are going to be very hostile to Suarez, and I'm equally certain we'll continue to stand with him. Call that tribal if you like, but I think it is just simple faith that if our player says he's innocent, we're prepared to support him. Anyone would act the same for their player. Is Chelsea going to abandon John Terry?

All that said though: whatever the cause, whatever his guilt or innocence, this suspension has probably fucked whatever chance we had for the top four, and I hope Luis remembers how we all stood behind him when summer comes and we're faced with another year without Champion's League football, and he's tempted to ask for a transfer. I am not worried about that, I have faith he'll want to stay a Red, and I am sure all our unflagging support will factor into his decision. But if he does abandon us, if I were him I'd go *far *away...

On the other hand, I also think he's suffered from very poor service, certainly more than a more creative forward like Suarez does, and I do think having Gerrard in the side has made him look a bit better. He's seemed a bit more comfortable lately. As I recall (possibly wrongly), his performance at Newcastle varied greatly depending on who was in midfield. Obvious, I suppose, but it is definitely something we need to do a better job of.

To be a successful journalist you adapt to those tastes and to be honest the ""News of the world"" journalists ( gawd forbid ) I've met were the brightest of the bunch because they had the ability to bring themselves down to the lowest common denominator and write on that level and that, to me, is talent.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"US is very different, UK consumer law is incredibly strong in comparison. As you are living here I'd recommend checking out what benefits you might not be aware of. :-)

Main bits are:

[Sale of Goods Act](http://whatconsumer.co.uk/the-sale-of-goods-act/). Covers laws on anything you buy, pay attention to ""fit for purpose"", that's the key bit. Basically like US ""lemon laws"", but quite strong and covers all goods instead of just cars. 

[Distance Selling Regulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Protection_%28Distance_Selling%29_Regulations_2000). A bunch of stuff that applies when you order stuff through the mail (by phone, online, method doesn't matter). Main thing to note is the 28-day return policy. A lot of advertisers will try to pass this off as something special when they must provide it by law. Also gives delivery date guarantees &amp; the right to cancel etc. 

[Trading Standards](http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/advice/index.cfm). These folks are basically state-paid ""lawyers"" that work for you for free to resolve disputes with stores. Not really qualified lawyers, but they know consumer law inside-out. The Better Business Bureau is your closest US equivalent, but our guys have pretty big teeth compared to them. I've used them once before and was pretty impressed at how quickly they changed the stores attitude on a TV that died one year outside of it's ""manufacturers guarantee"". 

Finally, you can bluff your way through not knowing the details if dealing with shop staff who don't want to play nice. Just saying ""I don't believe that the Sale of Goods Act works like that"" or ""I think Trading Standards might disagree with that"" will completely change their attitude almost every time. ;-)",0,1327441983,null,0,false,0,c3k9gvq,t3_ouq84,t1_c3k9gvq,t1_c3k944l,null,1428233196,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

However, the Doctor becomes involved and ""his universe"" disrupts her plans (though not him in particular). 

In one sense, it makes perfect sense for them to pair up. Her life was dramatically changed by meeting the doctor, possibly for the worse, and he wants to change that. If I had to find important characteristics for companions, the Doctor's desire to improve their lives by showing them the universe outside of their world would be #1.

true,nkirbit,num30-away,,"I just looked at both Defoe and Dzeko, since those are the two you mentioned.  The margins I'm talking about are the margins BEFORE the goals.  These are also premier league goals only.

Defoe Goals:  
1 when Tottenham is up 2  
3 when Tottenham is up 1  
3 when Tottenham is tied  
1 when Tottenham is down 2  

Dzeko goals:  
1 when City is up 4  
1 when City is up 3  
2 when City is up 2  
2 when City is up 1  
4 when City is tied  
1 when City is down 1  

So Defoe has 87.5% when his team is no more than 1 goal up, and 50% when they are tied are losing, while Dzeko has figures of 63.6% and 45.5%.  There's a big difference in the first one, but I would guess it's more due to the much higher amount of time City has large leads than Tottenham does than anything relating to the player's performances. Dzeko's goals certainly aren't meaningless much more than Defoe's are (and it's hard to blame him even if they were).",0,1327445701,null,0,false,0,c3ka7yg,t3_otwcl,t1_c3ka7yg,t1_c3k9xnu,null,1428233551,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Rose Tyler comes close, but I read her as having been an audience stand in; a blank slate who could be relatable to most of the people watching the show in one form or another. Rose is kind of a Mary Sue audience catch all. She becomes a badass at the end because the doctor made her that way.

Donna is never a badass. Donna doesn't ever really kick ass. She's a woman who comes from an even lower background than Rose, thinks she's tough, but is compassionate -- think of her reactions in FOP contrasted to those of the Doctor. Donna genuinely cares about people while the Doctor is disenchanted and still in a rut after losing Rose.

All the other characters get a happy ending of some kind. Rose gets her man, Martha gets her man. Donna got to see the universe and then got everything she saw ripped away from her. She might get married but all that character development she goes through by seeing the universe gets taken away.

I think Donna is great because she has a real story that you can connect to. Like a lot of people, she has her flaws. She's incredibly prickly and thinks she's funny.

The English people had just finished the Bloodiest war known yet, many who took up arms now in the voting and seats of power. Consensus was that war was a fucking horrible thing (that it is) and wanted to avoid it. Think of the worst moment of your life.. and what you’d do to avoid that.. Same mind set, Chamberlin was a fantastic PM, it’s unfortunate history knows him as the man who let Germany rise to power, rather than the man who repelled the power of the press; especially after how Lloyd George allowed for Fleet street to grow so rapidly into a uncontrolled beast.

As for the Soviets, we had actively fought them in the Russian civil war. The Russians was as isolated as they wished to be, they saw us as the devil, and we saw the same of them. After all how is any country going to react after they both flooded each other with spies.

Arthur's Seat - It's the big mountainy thing that overlooks Edinburgh. You have to climb it, it's a fun 20 minute ramble to the top and gives ridiculous views of the city.

Technically not in Edinburgh, but well worth it, is stopping by the [Sheep's Heid Inn](http://www.sheepheid.co.uk/index.html) in Duddingston.  20 mins walk from Arthur's Seat perhaps.  It's the oldest pub in Scotland (became a pub in 1360) and was given the name when James VI gave the owner a snuff box with a sheep's head on it.  Fantastic food, whiskey and local beers. I've had outstanding venison steaks, and haggis neeps and tatties while playing skittles outside in the beer garden.  Legit place, and everything a pub should be.

[Brass Monkey](http://www.theskinny.co.uk/venue/5617-brass_monkey) in the daytime is amazing.  As you sip your pint, might as well lie down in a room full of cushions and watch a film projected onto the wall for free!

Nearby is [The Mosque Kitchen](http://www.list.co.uk/place/102602-the-original-mosque-kitchen-and-cafe/) which is literally a kitchen connected to the mosque that serves fantastic curry, seriously good stuff, and as cheap as you'll find. Awesome.

For more standard (but equally great) pubs/bars, I think [the39thpotato](http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/oulbu/going_to_edinburgh_for_a_couple_days_in_late_feb/c3k67a7) did a great job.

Every spin-off now relies on our modern era being the foundation time-frame of the series.

That said, we can't afford most of the properties DSS tenants live in around our area and we're on pretty decent salaries.  At the moment we have to share with two other people each to afford it.  I heard on the radio that something like 40% of rent being paid is from these housing benefits.  I don't know if it's here, all over London, or all over the UK.  If the government takes this subsidy away, that should reduce that level of upward pressure on the rental market.  It's like they have basically increased demand artificially.  That said, changing it will cause quite a massive redistribution.  Some of it is quite bad, since some communities will pull apart as certain members of the community won't be able to afford living with other such members.  That said, for those who are not working, I don't see why they have to be unemployed and living in London where they could be unemployed elsewhere.  It's not like they're being deprived of job opportunities if they are never working.  I would rather have these properties open up at more affordable prices to those that work and let them cope without having to rely on benefits.

I mean, even if you disregard suggestions that are unequivocally malicious, and stick to stuff that is subjectively stupid: Is it justified to flood review sites with negative reviews? If your argument is that she deserves to be punished for her actions, then the method of doing so is an abuse of the review site. It effectively devalues to review site to those looking for genuine reviews, purely based on a vendetta. Essentially, you're punishing the review site and its users for the actions of this stupid woman. And that is stupid. Even if it isn't quite stooping to her level, well, half of pretty fucking terrible is still rather bad.

Ok, what if we take it one step further. What if we disregard all of the above, and somehow conclude that it actually is justified to try to destroy her business with negative reviews. Does her business employ any people other than herself? If so, then you're trying to destroy their livelehoods. You're punishing them for her actions. That, I would argue, crosses the line from merely stupid into actively malicious.

The very fact that she's been so publicly humiliated is a pretty notable (and pleasantly cathartic) thing. Imagine how many dickheads don't get this kind of naming and shaming?

People will sell those homes off again for a quick short-term profit for a start, but also people will need to move home for work, people will have financial problems, peoples children will grow up and need homes of their own etc etc. Selling one household their home clearly doesn't mean their family will forever own their own homes - but since those most able to buy those cheap properties will be the relatively wealthy, it was obviously going to cause a massive reduction in the availability of affordable housing for the relatively poor.

This was well-known at the time. But choosing to not buy your council house when everyone else was buying those wasn't a rational option - all it would mean is that you'd be even worse off later when the council houses ran out and you still had your adult kids living at home.

Looks aren't everything, though.  If I was picking companions, I'd choose Leela.  Still good looking, but it was the extreme competence and the smarts and instincts to get by well when into a situation beyond her experience that impresses me most.

While classic Who went into this territory occasionally, it was never anywhere near so self righteous - always couched in ""I like them for whatever reason"" lightheartedness.  Now he is a God.  Not good.

eta: That said - in Night Of The Humans some effort is made to counter this theme, as humanity is the encroaching alien menace (albeit a version of humanity swiped almost directly from The Face of Evil yet dumbed down a lot compared to that classic &lt;first Leela&gt; story).  _That_ said, the first couple New Series Adventure novels from the 5th series season have the characterization of The Doctor and Amy all effed up (likely because they had to be written before much was established about the characters and they shifted from initial scripts).

Secondly, maybe this is the way the writers intended the relationship to be.

If you'll notice, she was very much like the Doctor the first time she showed up in 'Library', but as the series goes on, we see her both as younger and in interspersed sections as her more mature self. River is complex as a character because the audience is watching her age in reverse meaning that to us, she gets more and more immature and sporadic.

As far as your griping about this character goes, I have this solution to offer: Don't watch episodes that she's in.

(Another pro-tip, if you walk out to Crammond Island, check the tide times.  There's people getting stuck out there all the time, which involves a coast guard rescue.  The walkway is covered by the high tide, and the tide moves fast because it's such flat ground.)

Cape on Goose Gate has a large and pleasant 1st floor bar which they tend to allow you to use for free in the week.

The Navigation (near the Evening Post) has an upstairs room they let you use for free though it's a bit shabby.

The olde Salutation on Maid Marion Way has an upper room though they were funny about it last time I enquirer (2010). Though pretty much any pub with a function room should be letting you use it for free in the week. Weekends and Friday nights are a different story you'll have to pay for those. 

I'd also be interested in having your event at Hackspace though we are not a licences venue we could get an event licence and buy in some a real ale cask and bottled beers if the event was sufficiently well attended.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"Indeed, this is a pointless argument as you seem to know even less about baseball than you do about the short lifespans of football managers.

A good pitcher can absolutely change the nature of the game. Unfortunately, this fails to prove your point, as a starting pitcher will only play every 5th game, effectively impacting only 20% of his teams output. While a closer may feature more often, he will only pitch 1-2 innings a game, making his individual impact even less significant than a starter. Furthermore, without offensive support, even the best pitchers will be rendered ineffective if their team does not generate sufficient run support. As a corollary, even the most dramatic batters in the world cannot carry a team that is defensively poor or has a weak pitching staff. Barry Bonds, who scored a staggering 73 home runs in a season and 137 runs batted in, only contributed to less than a quarter of his team's total runs for the season. Lionel Messi, on the other hand, has scored 22 goals and added 7 assists in La Liga this season. This makes his impact equal to almost 50% of the goals his team has scored this year. While these numbers do not exist in isolation, as you correctly pointed out, the idea that baseball is defined more by individual performances than football is wrong. Even the best batters need men on base to drive in, solo homeruns alone will not win baseball games very often. Pitchers need defensive players to support their mistakes and run support from their batters. It's a false characterization and overlooks the most basic facets of the game. 

Now obviously baseball is very different than football in other, more tangible ways. The average lifespan of a football manager is significantly shorter than those of their baseball counterparts. This alone proves that on average, football owners will sack managers that they consider to be under-performing far more readily than they will in baseball. While FSG has very little experience with sacking football managers, given their tolerance for failure in other ventures, it would only be reasonable that they would apply it to football, and perhaps moreso, as that is what the historical evidence suggests.

&gt; Even if it were legalised and taxed to high heaven it would still be cheaper than it is now.

If it were legalised then the production costs would be closer to those of tobacco (or indeed any other kind of plant that's easy to grow - lettuces, tomatos, etc).  If you take off the tax then it equates to about £1 per ounce for tobacco which covers the costs of production, distribution, marketing and sale, and makes a tidy profit for everyone along the way.

If the production costs of cannabis were the same (and there's no reason to think otherwise) then the government could charge £100 tax per ounce (20x the tobacco rate) and it could be on sale for say, £120 (also giving 20x the return for producer, distributor, retailer, etc).  The end user would still be paying less than half the current price.

# **Knuckle Cracking**
A doctor recently won a nobel prize for diligently testing this. 

When he was a child he was told by his mother that cracking knuckles gives you arthritis. He decided to investigate and spent the next sixty years only cracking the knuckles on his left hand, whilst never cracking them on his right. He didn't develop any problems, in either hand. 

# **People only use 10% of their brains**
This misconception arose from a misunderstanding. We do use 100% of our brain, but only use 10% at any one time. 

# **Bottled water is better for you than tap water**
In the UK it was discovered that Dasani (bottled water by Coca Cola) was literally straight from the water mains at the factory where it was bottled in Kent. The British press had a field day, ripped them a new arsehole, and completely embarrassed them. 

Coca Cola tried to defend this by saying it went through a ""highly sophisticated purification process"".

However, just weeks after launch 500,000 bottles of water were recalled because it was found to have excessive levels of bromate, a chemical linked to a greater risk of cancer. Samples were found to have between 10 to 25 parts per billion, British law allows for up to 10 parts per billion.

Where did the bromate come from? Coca Cola's purification process. Seriously. 

The process used to purify Dasani water relied on calcium chloride, which contained levels of bromide. Bromide, in turn, produced traces of bromate during a part of the purification procedure. 

Long story short, Coca Cola tried purifying perfectly good regular tap water and ended up potentially exposing people to a higher risk of developing cancer. 

Well played Coca Cola. ",0,1327488111,null,0,false,0,c3kgea0,t3_ougax,t1_c3kgea0,t3_ougax,null,1428236530,4,false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,4

Seriously though. 150 million? No player should be worth more than 10 million, let alone Torres's stupid, fantasy money transfer.

If you think this, then you don't know your history on the elitist institutions and social capital, these have exists for hundreds of years and so huge biased towards a select type of people. No just anyone can become prime minister or a high ranking politician. If they also represented the people, they would listen and implemented our demands, not just go to war or have bias towards the buddies in the city.  I would like to know of any cabinet minister today that doesn't have there fingers in some beneficial pie.

&gt; is that they don't like rules

The rules which say, don't steal, but yet the police protect the institutions which stole billions from the public sector or the rules which say don't protest because your government tells you not too. Sorry but rules need to be sensible and 100% implemented to be respected.

&gt; They think the world should just be happy and everyone should chill out and relax, 40 hour work weeks? Nahhhhhh just 20 mannnn. And then everyone dies because we stop producing the things we need to survive.

The irony here is that if everyone was employed to perform the minimal required services, the quantity of hours required to sustain society is very small. All other work is based on capital gain and not technically required to survive, its for luxury and the benefit of people higher in the chain.

&gt; Now you may not be a stoner, you may have a job, but I am generalising, and no, it isn't nice, is it?

Stoners don't kill people. Stoners don't directly inflict hardship on people because of huge debt. Stoners did not abuse the system. People without jobs don't inflict harm on you. JSA claimers cost far less then paying out the bankers. Disability claimants, well they're generally can't defend them self. 

Please show me the morality here. There is none. 

For you information, I do smoke and I do have a fairly well paid job. But this does not cloud my vision on the bullshit the state are attempting to inflict on innocent people.

One of the major problems we have these days is that people are more than happy to stand there pointing out problems, but nobody has a solution. Nobody puts forward a complete solution.

If a guy has been shot, and there are twenty people standing there saying ""the problem is he is bleeding"" ""i think he is going to die"" ""we can't just stand here and do nothing!"" ... the only person who ACTUALLY makes a difference is the doctor who comes along and actually does something. Who actually has an idea of HOW to help.

Most people I come across who seem to know every problem with society, have *ZERO* solutions.

&gt; The rules which say, don't steal, but yet the police protect the institutions which stole billions from the public sector or the rules which say don't protest because your government tells you not too.

Link me to a source where the Police Federation *DIRECTLY* protected ""institutions"" which stole billions from the public sector. Also, I'd like to see some proof of the Police Federation telling people not to protest. AFAIK they tell you not to riot, and to keep protests civil and peaceful. What is the difference between one guy throwing a brick at another in the street, and one guy in a crowd of a thousand throwing a brick at another guy in a crowd of a thousand? Nothing. They're both thugs.

&gt; The irony here is that if everyone was employed to perform the minimal required services, the quantity of hours required to sustain society is very small.

Really? Care to explain how you came to this conclusion, or is that just another sweeping claim? Pretty sure if it takes a week to harvest some crops, it takes a week to harvest some crops whether you like it or not.

&gt; All other work is based on capital gain and not technically required to survive, its for luxury and the benefit of people higher in the chain.

Capital gain. Yes, I work to make money. Why? Because it is currency. I cannot grow my own crops, make my own flour, bake my own bread, rear my own animals, butcher my own animals, craft my own furniture, build my own house, craft my own clothes, generate my own electricity, build my own devices. We are humans, we are social animals, we are not *meant* to do everything solo. How do you trade with people? By swapping things. Two shoes for one loaf of bread. Therefore a shoe = 0.5 loaves of bread. Four shoes = 2 loaves of bread. Therefore bread is now currency. We have a standard currency that allows people to trade. It isn't evil, it's *absolutely fucking necessary* to civilisation.

If I can make 10 loaves of bread a day and make enough money from that to buy another oven and make 20 loaves of bread a day, and then 40, then I become *rich*. Is that evil?

&gt; Stoners don't kill people.

Pretty sure that they do. Black gang members smoking weed and shooting people, people die. Therefore you're incorrect. Stoners have killed people.

&gt; JSA claimers cost far less then paying out the bankers.

JSA claimers do not earn the money they get. They get offered jobs and turn them down. They are just lazy. Bankers make their money.

Why do bankers get big bonuses? because they generate big amounts of money.

At Bread Bank Ltd, Banker Bob manages to buy a factory of 100 ovens for 1000 currency, he then sells that for 2500 currency, making his company 1500 currency. But it takes HARD work, so for that, they give him 10%, or 150 currency. Meanwhile Tom the Baker makes a loaf of bread a day, and makes 1 currency a day, at 20 currency a week. Is Banker Bob evil?

&gt; the bullshit the state are attempting to inflict on innocent people

What bullshit? I am a regular person, I don't have to worry about being killed, I don't have to worry about being mugged, I don't have to worry about running out of gas or electric, or being shot at, or having my home stolen by bigger people. The state looks after me. The roads get fixed - I pay them for it. My rubbish gets taken away - I pay for it. I can call Police 24/7 if I am in danger without paying them right there and then. 

Tell me how I am a victim of the state? I feel HONOURED to be a Briton.

I've got ideas, I'm not terribly great at articulating them in writing. But the solution I would invoke tend to be fairly drastic, involve removing leaders from the process and allowing an assembly of all people in a community to come up with solutions, because its not one person right to come up with a solution for everyone. You used the doctor example, which is wholly wrong, because this is a profession to help people live, not a person who demands power to control others.

&gt; Police Federation DIRECTLY protected ""institutions""

News of the world+News international ring a bell? Being one of the more obvious recent examples, also the behaviour towards the miner and there strikes back in the 80s, I've encountered countless people who where treated terribly by the police for merely attempting to protect the futures. The government ordered the police to more a less terrorise these people. But as I've said, I don't hate the police, I hate there abuse of power.

&gt; Really? Care to explain how you came to this conclusion, or is that just another sweeping claim? Pretty sure if it takes a week to harvest some crops, it takes a week to harvest some crops whether you like it or not.

Yes, but shared across everyone in society, not one person would need to cut the crops. My point being is that if 'not so enjoyable' work is distributed among everyone in society, individuals do not need to enter alienated states by doing shitty work, because you would not be performing the same task repeatedly.

&gt; Pretty sure that they do. Black gang members smoking weed and shooting people, people die. Therefore you're incorrect. Stoners have killed people.

I bet they ate marshmallows too, there for marshmallows kill people too. Its not the drug that caused them to kill, it was them selves. Cannabis can cause paranoia yes, but that is due the the illegal growth and trade of high THC substances with the neglect to responsible CBD levels. If it was legal, there would be far fewer of these types of problems. 

&gt; We have a standard currency that allows people to trade. It isn't evil, it's absolutely fucking necessary to civilisation

Maybe you should read some sociology books. Currency is not a requirement, if anything the most we need is a resource statistics system to monitor all our world resources and direct them into what is required by the human race and the future of survival. Not a select few people have fat pockets of cash. Also my point about distributing work across the masses for required essentials for civilisation, if all these jobs are shared across all the able bodied people in the country, we would have all the resources required. So no individual would be required to produce all there own requirements. Also machine.

&gt; JSA claimers do not earn the money they get. They get offered jobs and turn them down. They are just lazy. Bankers make their money.

Thats somewhat of a subjective statement? all JSA claimants are lazy!! YAAHHH! Lazy fuckers! It is true that some a rooted in this cycle of laziness, but my solution to this is education, people that are mostly in this cycle are depressed, low self esteem, unqualified, no confidence and possibly a number of other issues. These tend to be inherited from parents or even from the behaviour of teachers towards them as a child. Child perceptions on what they must do to achieve a result is hugely important, if this is not reinforced, then children very easily fall into a hole and possibly never get out.

&gt; Bankers make their money.
&gt; Why do bankers get big bonuses? because they generate big amounts of money.

Might make money, but its socially unethical money in most cases, its not produced to benefit the whole of society is it now? Its for a few people who are in a fortunate enough position to earn it. Also maybe you should look at the inequality and income scale between the rich and poor, its getting hugely wider. Normal workers earn less now then we did 30 years ago, where is the honesty and fairness in that. Bankers should not be allowed to gamble with any country, invent new ways of getting around legislation to make more money. Far as I'm concerned, the whole banking and financial industry is hugely corrupt and is far to intertwined with government on every level.

&gt; he then sells that for 2500 currency, making his company 1500 currency.

Why is that acceptable? Shouldn't the workers be getting a share of the benefits, why one organisation or person?  I believe that all businesses should operate as collectives and share the wealth, no individuals should be more privileged compared to the other.

&gt; I don't have to worry about being killed

No but 100,000s of other did though, Iraq war killed countless number. Is that not the state's fault? Or are they innocent little bunnies?

&gt; I don't have to worry about running out of gas or electric

No, but only because of the brutality of the state towards other nations. History shows this, after all the UK was one of the worse offenders of pillaging and stealing resources. 

&gt; The state looks after me

Only if you exist in certain classes.

&gt; The roads get fixed - I pay them for it. My rubbish gets taken away - I pay for it. I can call Police 24/7 if I am in danger without paying them right there and then.

Yep, but for how much longer - after all we're in austerity now and businesses should take over public sector work, until the businesses want to make more money and the government can't pay. There are cases where people ring the police (here in South London) for help, but the police are too busy. 

&gt; 

Be Honoured to be british sounds bigotted in my eyes, I'm honoured be alive on Earth! Earth is all that currently matters, not just Briton.

&gt; You and your kind just want to watch the world burn because you're not in power. 

I don't want power! I believe anyone who strifes for power is evil, because they want to control others for there own gain. I want assemblies and collectives to come up with solutions, implementations and interventions, which are eco-friendly and beneficial to all humans. Not this narrow minded economic view of continual growth, which theoretically can not perpetually exist, its created by the individuals of power to control the resources for them selfs at the end of the data. You and me won't be able to afford certain resources when they become too expensive. 

Take a look at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Ts9nGGjho&amp;feature=player_embedded - It's highlights the evolution towards a 3rd industrial revolution which is controlled by all of us, a distributed network on essential requirements is the only way forward. 

I know you may not agree with me, but all I want is fairness for everyone one earth, no country should be disadvantaged because of money or power.

true,5celery,tardis,TARDIS,"In his travels he's been to places where people have longer lifespans, higher intellect, etc - there are even several time traveling races.  It is okay for him to just like humans.  A person can just like rats (many do - and some even choose to no longer keep them because the heartbreak is too great when they die).  I think the trouble comes in when he offers them preference in moral situations.  

There aren't _too_ many cases where that happens - - fending off invasions is perfectly defensible (unless there is absolutely no alternative for the invader and they refuse compromise).  The Forgotten Army example I used above (somewhere) was rediculously easy to side with the doctor - the invaders [spoiler](/s""enslaved people because they had a chip on their shoulder about any race taller than they were"") (I kid you not - really flimsy premise and a pretty lame book as a result, unfortunately).

The new series doesn't do very sprawling stories compared to the old (except when the universe is imploding once per season)- it spends most of the time on Earth - but the issues become more concerning when it comes to the time span beyond when humanity has shot out across the cosmos and is the aggressor/invader as often as not.

To really rationalize his connection - you can go to the times he was exiled or stranded on Earth.  The Third Doctor early years and a significant stretch for the Eighth Doctor.  He's raised kids here.  Maybe he just gets limited by his habits - forgets to get out and stretch.

For the most realistic take on how a Time Lord would travel and how he'd relate to reality beyond humanity - the New Adventures novels probably do the best job.

However, to my mind Moffat is obsessed with the Doctor's name, and discussing who he is. It's come up a lot since he took over, and it's mentioned in the episodes he wrote during RTD's time.

Yes, a journalist at The Sun may be just as talented as someone at The Guardian, however it's the organisation and paper as a whole that are very different. The Guardian will cover a much wider spectrum of news compared to something like The Sun. 

Also i've always felt a paper like The Sun is very selective on what news it prints and most articles have some horrible nationalist spin.

The Guardian is much less likely to print complete garbage whereas everyday The Sun probably prints something that has zero evidence behind it. That's the real problem, unsubstantiated claims made by the tabloids, which usually result in scare-mongering and hysteria. 

I agree maybe the bulk everyday news is very similar between what stories both papers print, and they'll be written different for the appropriate audience, but that's just inevitable. It's printing nonsense that's the problem.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; ..but of course doing actual research doesn't lend itself to the idea of the downtrodden Northern Ireland Catholic that certain groups and people want to portray for whatever end suits their needs.

What is this history-denying bullshit? Discrimination in the history of NI is a simple fact. Heck, the whole electoral system was gerrymandered to prevent Catholics from having a political voice. This began at the start of the 20th century even before the creation of the NI state: 

&gt; ""In Armagh there are 68,000 Protestants, 56,000 Catholics. The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics. In Tyrone, Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant)

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Northern_Ireland] 

Between the 1920s to the 1960s one of only a handful of councils in Northern Ireland which had a majority of councillors from the Catholic/Nationalist community was Newry District Council, which had such an overwhelming Catholic majority (80%) that it was simply impossible to gerrymander in favour of Unionists (despite every possible way being explored). 

This goes right back to the conception of Northern Ireland in 1921 with its first prime minister James Craig declaring 

&gt; All I boast of is that we are a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State.

This made the position of Catholics in this society abundantly clear. As the government was Protestant dominated and gerrymandered to remain so, Catholics were heavily discriminated against in public jobs and housing. 

&gt; In addition, there was widespread discrimination in employment, particularly at senior levels of the public sector and in certain sectors of the economy, such as shipbuilding and heavy engineering.

There are members of the older generation of Catholics in NI who still remember showing up at a job interview for a *public sector* job and being asked which Orange Lodge they were a member of for god sake. 

And in discrimination in public housing, one of the most famous examples was in Tyrone, in 1968 when the council allocated a house to a Protestant 19 year old single woman over two homeless Catholic families. When nationalist Austin Currie MP had brought their grievance to the local council and Stormont in both cases, he was asked to leave. He then chose to organise the first ever civil right protest marches in Northern Ireland, which were met with a violent backlash by police and civil authorities and *this* has been referred to by some scholars as the spark which ignited the Troubles. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_troubles#Attacks_on_civil_rights_marches] 

So yes, discrimation isn't as prevalent now, but it has been a very real fact in NI history and was the biggest influencing factor in the Troubles. So mocking the idea of ""the downtrodden Northern Ireland Catholic"" is both misguided and offensive.

If both houses were elected at the same time then the house of lords would have an identical makeup as the commons and would just be a rubber stamp on its legislation. If it was elected half-way through the term of the commons then the electorates 'mid-term' blues could ensure legislative grid-lock similar to what can occur in the states.

Also, why do you think another room of career politicians would be helpful? Surely a chamber filled with those who have succeeded in life and have become experts in their own fields are better equipped to scrutinise legislation? In some ways, is it not of benefit to have a second chamber which is not primarily concerned with populist policies to ensure its own re-election? 

It's a really interesting question though and I'm mostly playing devil's advocate with my points above. Clearly the current system is inherently corrupt and those who make it in are definitely not 'the great and the good' as they perhaps should be.

Personally, I feel that you don't have a mandate to rule someone - and thus to imprison them - if you arbitrary take their rights away.

&gt; At the same time voting could help them feel more a part of society and encourage rehabilitation.

I feel this exactly encapsulates the differences between Britain and Europe.

We don't allow prisoners to vote because they're scum who have rejected their place amongst the lower orders, and the ruling class say they must be punished. In Europe rehabilitation is emphasised and they continue to be citizens.

Jehova's Witnesses I've spoken to will *never* under any circumstance admit that there is a single fault in the Bible, that any of it is wrong, contradictory, etc. because it's apparently ""perfect"", the direct word of God and absolute truth on all accounts.

I have heard the exact same from a Muslims I've spoken to on the same ideas. They will just not budge. Sure they might not *actually* do what it says in the ""bad"" parts, but they also won't admit that there's anything wrong with them, or that they should be removed, etc.

As far as I'm concerned anyone who holds that opinion is just a tiny little bit responsible for when people do these batshit insane things based on a book, because there are after all billions of people standing behind it saying that every word of it is perfection.

It might not make the biggest difference ever, of course, crazy people will always find some justification - but psychologically if they felt alone in their beliefs, if they didn't think they were supported by the beliefs of millions of worshippers as they often do, it would do *something* to help at least.

Damned cults, need to take some responsibility rather than ""Oh we're good, that doesn't represent us.... oh but yea this book is the perfect truth, word of God and all that.""
