2. James Street and Moorfields both serve the Wirral Line and allow you to get to Port Sunlight. Liverpool Central is the main station in the city, but that will be closed until October for repairs so you may find the alternative stations to be quite busy.

3. Short answer is no, you cannot cycle to Port Sunlight from Liverpool. However, Merseyrail is really getting into the whole biking thing so you'll at least be able to cycle to/from stations without much problem. Long answer is go via Widnes, Runcorn and Ellesmere Port, but obviously that's insane.

true,misskindle,null,null,"I think a lot of scaremongering happens when talking about Belfast. Granted we have a pretty colourful history of violence here but I don't think you have very much to worry about! Most people in Belfast are really quite friendly. As for the city centre at night, it's not so bad. Just tends to be quite a few drunk people but then again you will find that to be true of any city in the UK. 

On the places you've mentioned. The Oh Yeh music centre has a great night on the last saturday every month called Palookaville. Bring your own alcohol and dance in a really pleasant atmosphere. Its my favourite night out in Belfast! The Castle is worth a look, Botanic gardens is great on a good day and right beside Queens University which has a beautiful campus. The Opera House and the Waterfront Hall aren't terribly exciting unless you are going to see a show there however the Waterfront hall is close to the river which is lovely to go for a walk along! 

Culturlann McAdam O Fiaich is situated in the Nationalist area of Belfast. You seem to be intrested in Gaelic so it might be a fun place to visit but watch out, people will be speaking Irish there! To be honest as an American tourist you'd probably be very welcome there. We Irish do love a good American to boast to!

As for bars! Love and Death is quite nice by day but very expenisve in the evening as it is geared towards an older crowd. The Hatfield has a a combination of students and older people but by the time you get here all the students might be home for the summer. The Kitchen Bar tends to be quite busy but is right next to the main shopping mall in Belfast. McHughes is great for a nice pint. 

If you're looking for a younger more student crowd head to The Stiff Kitten, Laverys (which has 3 floors to suit all kinds of tastes and ages) etc etc.

I hope this helped a little. A lot of people here will probably disagree with my suggestions etc but it's all a matter of taste! Don't be afraid of Belfast!

P.s. if you make it to Kelly's there's an amazing seafood restaurant directly next door called Mourne Seafood, definitely worth a shot if that's your thing. 

Don't be cautious, there's really no need. So long as you stick to the city centre at night and don't find yourself wandering around Poleglass (or any other colourful areas) at 1am, Belfast is as safe as any city I've visited. 

All those places/things you've mentioned are well worth a look with the exception of Love&amp;Death and the Hatfield. The place is insufferable unless you prefer the rising smell of warm, dry sambuca mixed with fake tan, coupled with the most obnoxious people in Europe.

The current manager **Roberto Di Matteo** used to play for the club, but he's only supposed to be here temporarily. He's a bit of a legend though so we're hoping he stays on.

Our biggest rivalries historically are probably **Millwall**, and **West Ham**, although recent success has made us more direct rivals with **Man U**, **Arsenal**, **Liverpool**, and oddly **Barcelona**. In typical English fashion there's also a pretty strong rivalry with the other London teams like **Tottenham** and **QPR**.

**Some basic history:** First league title in 1955, 50 years after the club was founded, we wouldn't win our next league title until our 100th anniversary in 2005. Chelsea became quite a trendy club in the 60s and 70s with a lot of celeb fans and some moderate cup success, but by the 80s were on the verge of going under until Ken Bates bought the club for the princely sum of £1 and turned us around.

The biggest turning point in club history arguably came in the 90s with the glamour signing of Glenn Hoddle, who gave the club greater prominence in Europe and led to the signings of some true world class legends like Marcel Desailly, Gianluca Vialli and Ruud Gullit.

This took us up a notch to where we were challenging for European qualification, which is what attracted Abramovich to the club and brought us to where we are now as one of the biggest teams in Europe.",0,1335395353,null,0,false,0,c4gm5ki,t3_ssjgx,t1_c4gm5ki,t3_ssjgx,null,1428796643,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

**Chelsea (4-5-1) :**

Cech - Bosingwa; Cahill; Luiz; Cole -  Mata; Lampard; Mikel; Romeu; Kalou - Drogba/Torres (depends on who RDM feels is better fit)

**Bayern Munchen (3-5-2) :**

Neuer - Lahm; Van Buyten/Breno (if either's fit); Rafinha - Robben; Schweinsteiger; Pranjic; Kroos; Ribery - Gomez; Muller

Since Bayern only have 6 defenders available, and 4 of them are defensive wingers they will be rooting on either Breno or Van Buyten to be attacking, and I'm putting Pranjic cause he's their most defensive midfielder, Schweinsteiger can also defend alright so the two of them would hang a bit back allowing Kroos, Ribery and Robben to support Muller and Gomez in attacking. Since their lack of defensive players they are forced to go to an all out attack and that will be the key to our chance of winning.

I am expecting both Cahill and Luiz to be fit, and I fully expect RDM to line up a defensive start because it's obvious Bayern is going to be on the offense, the only real question I can't choose is whether he'll go with Drogba (been extremely good recently and can really make the chances count) or Torres (Since their defense is so vulnerable and their only defensive options are 2 Wingers and one really slow center back Torres's speed could really count for something).

true,[deleted],null,null,"According to some UN thing in ~2010 (it's late and I'm tired, so I'm not going to try to find it), Belfast was actually one of the safest cities in Europe for tourists, so there's absolutely no reason to worry about getting in trouble. Even making basic mistakes politically won't get you in trouble if you're obviously a tourist - you'll get a harsh correction and a glare, but unless someone's drunk or something, they're not going to give you trouble for it :)

You could go to Castle Ward as well, as they filmed a few scenes of Game of Thrones around there (if you watch GoT, obviously), or you could look up some other places where they were shooting it.

I'd say my top few places would be Stormont (parliament buildings, with a fairly nice park around it), Grand Opera House, the Cathedral, at least one National Trust property (Castle Ward, Rowallan, whatever - you can find them on the National Trust website), and one of the bus tours. There's also the Ulster Museum which has just reopened recently (about six months ago) which is quite cool, although not particularly 'Irish' - it's just a museum which has loads of different stuff in it.

Also, with regards to calling yourself Irish, I saw that someone else advised you not to. I guess the best way to think of it is if I, as someone who has lived in the British Isles all my life and both my parents had too, said that one of my grandparents was American and lived there until they were 15, I'd have a right to claim American heritage, but if I said ""I'm American"", you'd probably be like ""ehh... no you're not. You don't know what it's like to live here, and you don't understand 'us' as a people."". I guess it's just a case of distinguishing between heritage and nationality - we do it quite distinctly in the British Isles and Europe in general, for example: officially my mum is half-Scottish, but she would only ever say ""I'm Northern Irish"" because she never lived in Scotland. It's a weird cultural difference between the US and the UK, and it comes from the amount of immigration into the US during the last few hundred years, I guess. Don't worry too much about it, we won't be too mad at you for it! :)",0,1335396019,null,0,false,0,c4gmatp,t3_ss8mi,t1_c4gmatp,t3_ss8mi,null,1428796705,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6

 FOR:

* Andrea Leadsom MP - Censoring default, other bad material eg anorexia/suicide forums, filter TLDs, BBFC-esque organisation required

* Reg Baily, Mother's Union, author of report - Active choice,  porn gives unrealistic expectations, children sexualised too young

* Sonia Livingston, Professer of Social Pyschology at LSE - Active choice, porn pressurises children, education of children in school crucial

AGAINST:

* Jim Killock, Open Rights Group - Censorship is wrong, will create false sense of security, impractical at ISP level

* Brooke Magnanti, author of books on sex - average age of kids having sex has stabilised, percentage gone down, not most damaging thing children can be subjected to, still responsibility of parent.

* Julie Bindel, feminist author - In favour of legislation, against censorship, ""pornography is a depiction of horrific sexual violence"", doesn't trust state to censor correctly

* Andrew Murray, Professor of Law at LSE - Firewall extremely expensive, probably won't work, opt-in could infringe on human rights, legislation a blunt instrument, educate parents &amp; children

* Johnny Anglais, porn performer, ex-teacher - viewing act of sex not damaging, possibly beneficial, parents need to talk about sex, parents should be in control of any restrictions

* Commenters on the BBC website seem to be largely against

Is the difference between government spending versus how much they have repaid.
The deficit contributes towards the national debt.

However they have stifled the economy and raised unemployment.
Their political mantra simply doesnt work during a recession. The mechanisms of selling off state owned services leaves the whole country poorer overall in the long run.

There is a much faster way than both of fixing the economy than increasing growth or cutting spending...

Get some politicians in who know what they are doing instead of this lot of crooks, liars and fraudsters.

Personal debt increasing, where do you get this so called debt from then?

Since the banks weren't lending during the credit crunch and it has become much harder to lend from them ever since where exactly is this debt coming from? from thin air?

It seems you are a little confused.

America has been in Afghanistan since 2001, with support of British Special forces.

In 2003 a Massive Taliban resurgence began. The main victims of this were the Afghans themselves. (If you've read ""the Kite Runner"" you know what I mean.)

from 2003-2006 two Massive Terrorist attacks occurred in the western world. They were as follows:

- 2004 Madrid - 191 dead
- 2005 London - 52 dead

These were un-foiled attacks.

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism#Examples_of_attacks) shows the decrease in European and American attacks as time goes on, with our deployment in Afghanistan.

The Opera House has everything from Gilbert and Sullivan to Sing-A-Long Abba so depending on your tastes it might be worth a visit. Belfast Castle has nice views, but is a bit out of the way so may be best visited along with the Zoo (build on a hillside, wear good walking shoes!)

Cool places to eat in Belfast? There's a nifty one just beside the Waterfront Hall - a boat is permanently moored there and runs as a bar/cafe during the day and a pub with music some nights. Around the university area you'll find tons of reasonably priced places ranging from the excellent fast food of Boojum and Build a Burger (think Subway for mexican food and burgers), the traditional fry-up at Maggie Mays or The Other Place, all-you can eat chinese buffet at China China, some excellent chippies and some decent yet non-ripoffish restaurants too (Villa Italia, Tony Romas, Benedicts, Madisons)

There's loads of hostels and hotels around the university area (Stranmillis/Malone/Lisburn Roads) and although most students will be gone by the start of June it's still a nice part of town. Some might say that it's improved when they're all gone! The Students' Union won't shut down though, and the bars inside will be showing sports matches and hosting regular local gigs and club nights (everything from metal to trance). 

If you're into anime/gaming and about on the 22nd-24th June, I'm one of the organisers of [Q-Con](http://www.q-con.org.uk), which is pretty much the biggest con of its kind in the UK or Ireland and a pretty cheap weekend of amusements (just avoid the traders!)

As has already been stated, spend a few days touring the north coast - there's a whiskey distillery in Bushmills, the Giants' Causeway is a must see, and pretty much the whole coastline is gorgeous when the weather is good. Ballycastle has some decent surf, a golf course, and is close to where Marconi made some of the first ever overseas radio transmissions. Hop on a short ferry to Rathlin Island (Where the radio transmissions were recieved) and you might see a load of birds depending on the season.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"Plastics come from oil and use natural gas too. About 5% of household waste apparently is from plastic bottles - which get buried in landfill if they're not recycled. These are to me important factors.

PET when recycled embodies about 75% of the energy of producing it from raw materials (http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/impee/topics/RecyclePlastics/files/Recycling%20Plastic%20v3%20PDF.pdf). The problems with PET revolve around collection and sorting. It is very sensitive to being mixed with PVC which it is hard to separate from. It seems that a compulsory stamping system or some other industry wide solution could solve this problem.

What's better? Reuse.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Doctor Who has made massive influence on the world of science fiction and mainstream philosophy. During a period of cynicism and ""dark and gritty"" reboots, Doctor Who was one of the only shows that actually steps forward and completely embraced the idea of optimism and intellectualism triumphing over brute force and violence.

But arguably the most important influence is how accepting Doctor Who was with it's view of the world. In the renewal's second season we're treated to a host of bizarre creatures throughout the cosmos from tree-people to heads in jars and despite all of the sheer *alien* nature of all these characters, the Doctor welcomes them with open arms.

Jack Harkness is one of the very few lead bisexual characters on television, and his character had *a lot* to do with mainstream acceptance of different sexualities taking major roles. This was a major step forward in television history, and yet his being bisexual is not what defines him, it's treated not as a stereotype that forms him, but a mere character quirk that's just a part of a truly deeper character. That's barrier breaking.

Essentially Doctor Who's renewal has had none core philosophical theme: everything dies, so run with life while you can.

That's a weighty topic. Memento mori and carpe diem.

Additionally the Doctor is a wholly unique main character. He's not a plucky protagonist, he's not meant to be very relatable. In many ways he's written like a demi-god battling against evil. 

He's been followed by death and made himself the executioner of worlds. He's called the ""Oncoming Storm"" and is the thing of legends in his universe. He's the last of his kind, as he killed all his people in an endless war.

That's not the typical hero, nor is Doctor Who the typical story. That's a lot of weighty material they use.",0,1335404406,null,0,false,0,c4go2ya,t3_spwc8,t1_c4go2ya,t1_c4gntxq,null,1428797549,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;Why does it, because that is what its like where you live?

You're yet to provide any evidence that you somehow don't have white privilege, and this black guy does. Until you tell me which out of that list in the PDF don't apply to you and do apply to him, then there's no real reason to keep talking because you're just dodging my questions.

White privilege extends beyond the boundaries of your town or city. It's a privilige you have in all of western society, just because you're white.

&gt;Did you actually read that list? 

Yes, did you? You've yet to answer any of the questions on the list and instead think that somehow a black man has white privilege.

&gt;Have you ever visited anywhere else in the UK other than the few miles around where you live?

Yes actually, but i don't think any of this is relevant.

You keep trying to deny that you have white privilege and then go on to say that a black man you know has it? Let's go through them shall we?

&gt;1) I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time.

You have this, he doesn't (very few non-white ethnicities)

&gt;2) If I should need to move, I can be pretty sure of renting or purchasing housing in an area, which I can afford and in which I would want to live.

You have this, he doesn't. White people have systematically over the centuries exploited black people to garner more wealth.


&gt;3) I can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me.

You have it, he doesn't You can be pretty sure not to find any anti-white racists in your predominately white area right?

&gt;4) I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed.

Black people are stopped and searched more often by police. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;5) I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely
represented.

White people everywhere. Black people are not as represented in TV or newspapers compared to white people. Especially not represented as proportionate to their percentage of the population. Name one black chat-show host. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;6) When I am told about our national heritage or about “civilization,” I am shown that people of my
color made it what it is.

There's a reason the US has black history month. It's because the other 11 months are white history months. Over here the education we receive is primarily about white people, the only black people we really learn about are MLK and Rosa Parks, and they're American. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;7) I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their
race.

Same again, education focusing primarily on the history of white people around the world while black history is relegated to its own month because it's often squashed from history. You have and he doesn't.



&gt;8) If I want to, I can be pretty sure of finding a publisher for this piece on white privilege.

More white authors than black, and the black authors who write about the hardships of being black and less liekly to be published and less likely to be successful. Compare Zadie Smith to Joe Pemberton. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;9) I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented, into a supermarket
and find the staple foods which fit with my cultural traditions, into a hairdresser’s shop and find someone
who can cut my hair.

All of these things you have and he doesn't.

&gt;10) Whether I  use  checks,  credit  cards  or  cash, I  can  count  on my skin  color  not to work  against the
appearance of my financial reliability.

Black stereotypes include being unintelligent, absent fathers, poor with money. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;11) I can arrange to protect my children most of the time from people who might not like them.

Racism is everywhere, especially against black people here in England. You have this, he doesn't


&gt;12) I  can swear, or dress in second hand  clothes, or not  answer letters, without having people attribute
these choices to the bad morals, the poverty, or the illiteracy of my race.

Again, pretty self-explanatory. You have all of this and he doesn't.



&gt;13) I can speak in public to a powerful male group without putting my race on trial.

A black person if often unable to talk about something, especially in the company of white males, without people thinking that he is somehow 'different' in his views because of the colour of his skin, and that his views are less worthy and need to be defended just because he's black. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;14) I can do well in a challenging situation without being called a credit to my race.

Nowhere has a white man been called a 'credit to his race' because his race is seen as the default, whereas attention is made towards people of colour. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;15) I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.

'heyy you're a black guy, what do you think black people think?' A white person never gets asked this, because its assumed white people are a collection of different individuals whereas black people are some how a hivemind. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;16) I can remain oblivious of the language and customs of persons of color who constitute the world’s
majority without feeling in my culture any penalty for such oblivion.

Black people (moreso than white foreigners) who don't speak English as well are often discriminated against more because of this. You can know nothing about life in Africa and feel no shame about it, but a person of colour, especially if a foreigner, is often lambasted for their lack of understanding of 'western' culture and societal norms. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;17) I can criticize our government and talk about how much I fear its policies and behavior without being
seen as a cultural outsider.

Again, pretty self explanatory. White people, no matter how ill-informed, still seen as 'british' over a black person, and thier opinions often hold weight. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;18) I can be pretty sure that if I ask to talk to “the person in charge,” I will be facing a person of my race.

Again, obvious. White people have been massively over represented in jobs and positions of power for years.You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;19) If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven’t been singled
out because of my race.

First one is relevant here. A famous grime rapper (JME) has tons of videos of him getting pulled over for driving a nice car. If he was white we can be sure this wouldnt happen. think about the reactions of young white person driving a nice car = rich, young black person driving a nice car = drug dealer. Works for older people too. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;20) I  can  easily  buy  posters,  post-cards,  picture  books,  greeting  cards,  dolls,  toys,  and  children’s
magazines featuring people of my race.

Black children under-represented in toy catalogues, adverts, postcards (think about the ones you see on the beach) and children's magazines especially. Next time you nip through Tesco look at the children's magazines and see how many have a black kid on the cover. You have this, he doesn't.




&gt;21) I can go home from most meetings of organizations I belong to feeling somewhat tied in, rather than
isolated, out-of-place, outnumbered, unheard, held at a distance, or feared.

People are often suspicious of persons of colour at work, questioning whether they got the job because of their race. Because of this they are often excluded from actual decision making by other employees. You never have to worry about this. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;22) I can take a job with an affirmative action employer without having coworkers on the job suspect that
I got it because of race.
.
Read above. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;23) I can choose public accommodation without fearing that people of my race cannot get in or will be
mistreated in the place I have chosen.

More US centric this one, but there's still the occasional news story about black people or asian people being refused service because of the colour of their skin or their perceived religion. You never have to worry about this. You have this, he doesn't.


&gt;24) I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help my race will not work against me.

Black people are overrepresented at every single stage of the justice system. White people are not although they conduce more crimes on average. You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;25) If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether it
has racial overtones.

Did that guy refuse my refund because i'm black? Did that bus not stop at this stop because the bus driver is racist? You have this, he doesn't.

&gt;26) I can choose blemish cover or bandages in “flesh” color and have them more or less match my skin.

Flesh coloured bandages = peach = white skin coloured. You have this, he doesn't.


Start to get it now? You never have to worry about these things just because you're white. Yes people you know may be poor and not have a chance at getting jobs because of a lack of chances at education etc. I know what that's like. But you'll always have your skin colour to put you ahead of any black person in the same position.

&gt;
&gt; There is a much faster way than both of fixing the economy than increasing growth or cutting spending...
&gt;
&gt; Get some politicians in who know what they are doing instead of this lot of crooks, liars and fraudsters.

What do these magical politicians actually do? That's the hard question and something no one has conclusively answered yet. If it was simply, other counties in similar situations would already be doing it and it's highly likely our government would be doing it as well. After all, it's very unlikely that they would want to be an unpopular government dealing with an economy falling back into recession. 

Again, there are no simple solutions here, no risk free sure bets and nothing that will happen quickly. The problems we face are a result of decades issues multiple administrations have either ignored or fueled, combined with many other nations making the same mistakes. 

&gt; Personal debt increasing, where do you get this so called debt from then?
&gt;
&gt; Since the banks weren't lending during the credit crunch and it has become much harder to lend from them ever since where exactly is this debt coming from? from thin air?

According to [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/jan/25/family-finances-debt) it's ""credit cards, loans, overdrafts and other forms of credit"". It is true that people are finding it hard to secure new lines of credit, there is nothing preventing them from maxing out existing lines of credit. It is a huge issue for this country, it cannot be ignored.

&gt; It seems you are a little confused.

I don't really buy the whole banks that make money are evil argument. I concede that high level employees pay and bonuses need to be controlled better, but the real owners of banks are the shareholders and have definitely not got rich of their holdings in the last 5 years as every banking share has pretty much crashed and most holders are sitting on big losses. On top of that the biggest shareholders are the Government (i.e us) and pension funds, not the ""rich"" that everyone seems to enjoy pointing the finger at. 

The biggest issue with banks refusing to lend and as a result growth faltering is in the construction industry and to be honest, I'm not really surprised. We have yet to pop the housing bubble that formed over the last two decades and banks are desperately trying to de-leverage before rates start to rise again and the market corrects itself.

&gt;I don't believe religion should be part of education at all, it isn't fair on children.

You are entitled to that opinion, but I would argue that is an extremist viewpoint, and not teaching children about religion will cause them to grow up ignorant about other cultures. Religion is a big part of our world, maybe not in the UK right now, but I don't think it does any harm to teach kids about religion. 

Since most people would argue that is generally a good thing for children to learn about then we should offer religious families the opportunity to have the basis of that taught from within their own belief system.

Actual religious education isn't part of the curriculum until secondary school. Religious studies isn't a kind of indoctrination, religious schools must follow the same national curriculum as non religious schools. 

Where a school is non-religious it should be an option for families of non-believers to opt-out, but I don't think non-believers should be able to dictate how believers raise their children particularly when the churches pump so much money into our education systems and provide educational facilities as this reduces the cost of education system to the taxpayer. 

&gt;They must make up their mind on their own beliefs when they are at the right age

They can choose whether they believe it or not as they go along. Can you please tell me how its possible to choose a religion to believe in if you have no basic knowledge in the first place. I suspect people choose ""at the right age"" one way or another regardless of whether they attend RE or whether they go to a religious faith based school. I went to a Roman Catholic comprehensive, I didn't turn into a fanatic. In fact I chose at a very early age not to take much of an interest in religion, I was always more interested in other things, I guess I'm an agnostic.

On one hand it'd be tempting to start Torres because he must be feeling pretty amazing and ready to score some more..  but then there's Drogba who's actually been in better form if you look at the last couple games as a whole...  not to mention how amazing he was in the two legs against Barca.

true,majypoo,kernow,Cornwall,"Its not a extremist viewpoint at all, its neutral. I don't see the point in teaching children fairy-tales and superstitions its a massive waste of time and resources. Children should be taught about different cultures but that should be in a history or geography class. Why on earth would learning the Bible/Koran be useful to a child? R.E in secondary school should be a opt in subject. 

&gt; Where a school is non-religious it should be an option for families of non-believers to opt-out, but I don't think non-believers should be able to dictate how believers raise their children particularly when the churches pump so much money into our education systems and provide educational facilities as this reduces the cost of education system to the taxpayer. 

I'd like some sources on how much the churches in this country are spending towards education in this country. So taxpaying parents who pay towards their children's education are not allowed a say but because the church ""spends"" so much money on schools they can dictate themselves? is that what you are saying? 

&gt; They can choose whether they believe it or not as they go along. Can you please tell me how its possible to choose a religion to believe in if you have no basic knowledge in the first place.

Plenty of churches, mosques, synagogues for people to go to learn about a religion, you also have the internet. Just because the biggest religions can afford to provide religious schools they shouldn't have more or a say on children than Pagans etc. 

&gt; I suspect people choose ""at the right age"" one way or another regardless of whether they attend RE or whether they go to a religious faith based school.

The reason why the big religions are still around today is due their version of education and getting to that child whilst they are very young and vulnerable. I went to a CoE school and when I said I didn't believe in god I was put in detention and lambasted for my beliefs by my teacher. It does happen a lot more than you think just watch that Channel 4 documentary on the Muslim faith schools in this country. Parents have no right to force their own beliefs on their children.

Every time we turn on a Dr. Who episode, we open a portal into an alternate universe that the Doctor reside in, a Whoniverse if you will.

For example, you never see a Weeping Angel transplanting someone outside the Whoniverse, only a different time... *still within the Whoniverse*. As visitors to the Whoniverse, we do not cause or affect anything through our viewing portal, we can only observe. Therefore, I argue that we can observe the Angels move.

**TL:DR** - We can see the Weeping Angels move because we are not currently in the Whoniverse, we are only peering inside. You can still be afraid.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Its not a extremist viewpoint at all, its neutral.

No its quite extreme to argue that our christian-based secular society no longer allows faith schools and/or religious education. 
Which is really the thrust of what you are saying even though you are dithering around religious edcuation being opt-in. 

The United Kingdom is a highly tolerant and secular society and  one of its great success stories is being successful at accommodating other cultures and beliefs into a christian society.

It is not neutral to all to argue that religious education is all ""fairy-tales and superstitions"" and  ""its a massive waste of time and resources"", it is a militant viewpoint and one that is highly offensive when just blurted out in real life. I prefer to live in a tolerant society where we acknowledge people exist and let people live the life they feel most comfortable with providing  they are not infringeing on the rights of others to do the same. 

It's also incredibly self-righteous, given there is no proof or otherwise of God's existence, to say they are fairy tales. You could argue String Theory is a fairy tale, the big bang  is a fairy tale, the Higgs-Boson is a fairy tale. None of these things have actually been proven either. They are theories too. If scientists are entitled to hold scientific theories, why aren't religious people entitled to hold theological theories? All this ideas are philosophies. So is atheism a philosophy, if atheism was a human it would be a short angry man wearing a hitler moustache, a person who found fault and constantly criticized others.    

Do I need to remind you yet again that the religious bodies put their money and resources into our education system and this benefits the country.  They make a valuable contribution to our country, and it isn't going to change any time soon. u mad bro?

That we should drop religious education from the curriculum, because it doesn't suit your personal views is rather fascist . Just because you don't personally agree with something nobody else should be taught about it. It's a very narrow-minded opinion that. 

&gt; Why on earth would learning the Bible/Koran be useful to a child?

Because they understand a bit more about how other people think and what they believe and how to interact with them. People, British people who make a valuable contribution to British Society. 

&gt;I'd like some sources on how much the churches in this country are spending towards education in this country.

I don't have any,  what I do know is the school I went to was set up and funded between the diocese and the local authorities. I believe this is a common model.  They also let non-catholic children in who did not have to take part in religious studies. 

&gt;The 1944 Education Act enabled church schools to opt into the maintained system by choosing between aided and controlled status; some chose to become independent.

&gt;In an aided school, church involvement was very significant, and the church had majority representation on the governing body. Aided school governors, unlike those in county and controlled schools, were employers of their staff, responsible for building extensions and external repairs (for which they received a percentage reimbursement from the LEA) and admission authorities for their schools with responsibility for admission appeals.

&gt;Controlled status was designed to enable many of the older church schools to undergo major physical renovations with state funding. LEAs became totally responsible for controlled school finance, but the school sites continued to be owned by the trustees. The church retained a minority representation on the governing body.

There are some numbers here for you to chew on 
http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2011/roman-catholic-schools-in-england-and-wales/

&gt;So taxpaying parents who pay towards their children's education are not allowed a say but because the church ""spends"" so much money on schools they can dictate themselves? is that what you are saying?

No as I said previously in non-religious based state schools it makes sense for Religious Education to be optional, however, if you send your child to a religious-based school, it seems rather stupid and hypocritical to refuse to take part in the religious element, although from my own school which I left a long time ago, I know this was an option for the local non-religious kids who went there. They weren't forced to attend the religious elements of the curriculum, but it always seemed a little dumb sending them to a religious school if you don't believe in religion. 

Where only the taxpayer provides funding then the parents should have a say in religious education, but where funding is a partnership between the school and the church then the church should have a bigger influence, that is common sense. 

Why should atheist parents have an influence on a jewish faith school when they dont contribute anything towards that school, that's quite ridiculous. 

&gt;The reason why the big religions are still around today is due their version of education and getting to that child whilst they are very young and vulnerable

That's an opinion, its almost as if there are no born-again people or converts in your world. 

So you want children to choose when they are at the right age

as you believe that this will kill off religion because 

if they didn't get indoctrinated with religion they wouldn't be religious and your goal is for everyone to not be religious because its all fairytales and superstitious mumbo jumbo, even though 

you were indoctrinated with religion and while at school decided for yourself you didnt believe it. 

And there are millions like you, so it didnt work anyway. 

Trying to enforce atheism was tried under communism. It wasn't actually successful. 

&gt; I went to a CoE school and when I said I didn't believe in god I was put in detention and lambasted for my beliefs by my teacher. 

Maybe it was the way that you went about raising it, the time and the place you chose to raise it and the atmosphere you raised it in. 

It's foolish to believe you can say what you like, whenever you like. If you are going to be contentious then there is a time and a place to do that. 

Just blurting out stuff that is offensive to others is a sure-fire way to piss people off, being deliberately offensive to others in real life in the Uk is a sure fire way to get a punch in the face.

&gt;  Parents have no right to force their own beliefs on their children.

Parents have every right to bring their children up in the way they deem suitable to them. 

Right to freely worship is covered in article 9 of the EU Human Rights Legislation and article 18 of the UN's declaration of human rights. 
  
Maybe we should change everything now because Richard Dawkins has decided to create a malicious army of hatemongers in order to sell some books. 

The problem with Modern atheism is its inability to see its own failings, so confident is it in its lack of belief, it becomes highly dictatorial and fascist about the beliefs and rights of others.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I can see the theoretical benefit of mortgages being inflated away, but doesn't it rely on wages rising in line with inflation? At the moment average wage increases are way below inflation. If you have a mortgage and no wage increase then inflation is not helping you at all, it's just making everything else more expensive and your wages have to stretch even further. This is the situation I am in and I'm sure many others are too. Add to this the fact that interest rates will have to rise eventually, and that house prices are probably still too high and it's not really good news for home-owners still.

Perhaps I shouldn't have phrased it the rich vs the poor, my point was that the richer you are the more chance there is you will benefit from inflation. If you have no assets and a below inflation pay rise then you are worse off. If you are a home-owner but get no pay rise then you are still worse off. If you own lots of homes or other non-cash assets then you are more likely to be better off. Inflation is not only a tax but a regressive one, people are right to question whether or not it is benefiting them. 

There is an argument that the government should be using the money generated from QE to boost the economy directly, rather than just hoping the banks will lend more. For example there is [Green Quantitive Easing](http://www.greennewdealgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Green-QE-report-CBFSD-Policy-News-2012-No-1.pdf).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, I assumed initially that, since we were viewing the adventures of Dr. Who, then we were in the Whoniverse somehow, seeing as we were passively obeying the rules the Whoniverse lays down throughout the episodes and seasons. We didn't get to see an Angel move until the mentioned episode, we experience the timeline as the Doctor does (for the most part), things like that. This perspective allows for me to wish the Doctor will come along and whisk me away on adventures. Unfortunately, that isn't possible because I am not a pretty girl, but a male. 

The other perspective is the one I presented. Since we as the viewer cannot alter the episode being viewed, we are but impartial observers of the Whoniverse. This is sad, but we do get the benefit of pausing, skipping ahead, rewinding, and viewing events out of sequence as we see fit. Additionally, we get to watch things that could not possibly happen if we were in the Whoniverse, like seeing an Angel move.

Politicians are deadly, they make life and death decisions at will. Millions dead in the last ten years by orders issued by politicians. How many were killed in World War Two and under Stalin's reign? It wasnt religious leaders ordering the deaths of tens of millions it was politicians.

Religions have very little power in this world, and the little they do have tends to be overstated.

Maybe in the middle ages the religions had some power but today, I think they have about as much as the Queen - head of the Anglican church. Are you a royalist? Do you understand what that means?  That she has power over one of the biggest christian churches in the whole world.

true,youignorantslut,lfc12,,"For both Ajax and Uruguay, Suarez plays on the right as an inside forward. I remember reading an article that the traditional behind-the-striker playmaker role is becoming obsolete and *trequartistas* are now being played out wide with the liberty to drift inwards, like David Silva or Juan Mata does. We've seen numerous chances Suarez has made from the channel that fail with the lack of a complete finisher.

But why doesn't Kenny utilize him in this role? I think it's very much because he relates to Suarez. He sees much of himself in the player and wants Luis to play the same role he did before so effectively in the 70's and 80's, a part of the 2 in a traditional 4-4-2 (although he has experimented with formations recently). I sometimes feel Kenny refuses to put him in his ""natural"" position because Suarez doesn't always track back like our other wingers (i.e. Kuyt)

We all know that Liverpool desperately needs a designated finisher/poacher. Having one would greatly liberate both Suarez and Andy Carroll. It's quite frustrating/heartbreaking to watch Suarez try to do everything for the team. We need a third forward that would allow Suarez to focus on creating chances and sneaking in between defenders. Carroll focusses on bullying the defenders like a battering ram, opening up the space.

***Now for some Football Manager Fantasy...**.*

I believe Liverpool's ideal purchase would be Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. It is proven during their time at Ajax that they have beautiful chemistry together. And recently it seems like he isn't having the best time at Schalke with a training ground bust-up with Jermaine Jones and now the team bus forgetting him. If we're lucky, I'm sure he would be interested in a move. Borussia Mönchengladbach are only 2 points behind Schalke at the moment for 3rd and Champion's league. Getting 4th place would leave them in Europa League which we are in as well through the Carling Cup. So why the fuck not Klaas-Jan?

Does their squad really look good enough that you think their key buys and Mancini will be in 2 Champions League finals/3 Premier League Titles by 2019 and still be able to produce? Maybe they get 1 title this year. Roman did better, and tbh if he does not want to hire Matteo, I trust his judgement far more then the media and Reddit's. But lets go over them.

Grant has gone on to prove he sucked. If anyone disagrees I will say why but I think his record speaks poorly enough for itself. Scolari was a failure, has done nothing since he was fired, and if he is so good why does no one else want him either? Raineri was no where near as good as Mourin. and I think Inter this year shows his qualities. Only Mourin. was outright wrong to fire. AVB and Ancelloiti were questionable, but the team has turned around alot since AVB, and Ancelloiti was brought on specifically because he was suppose to have the mastery of winning the Champions League with an old squad and he did worse each year then others then. 

I think he deserves a chance, but just because everyone wants to piss and moan because we fire managers so much doesn't make the decision to any more wrong. Ancellioti was not going to rebuild this team, he would have gotten fired this season instead. AVB unfortunately pissed everyone off so it does not matter how good he will be for some lucky team, we would be pissing bricks with him as manager still and have no shot at Europe, cant replace the team. Not to mention, every time we have fired a manager we have managed to increase in form and 2/3 times make the Champions League final. The players clearly needed a new message each of those seasons. 

And yes I did not mention GH for a reason, he was not fired",0,1335431040,null,0,false,0,c4gsb6a,t3_ssv2m,t1_c4gsb6a,t1_c4gq75l,null,1428799604,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

My grandparents are 90, fought in the War, didn't get to go to University, and always voted Old Labour and then Socialist (post-blair)

They hate the current situation as much as anyone but it's not like they could do anything to change it, blaming the entire older generation is not only pretty useless but it plays into the divide and conquer strategy of the current administration and the financial interests that strongly influence policy.

Remember under an FPTP system we are massively influenced by the votes of a minority of marginal swing voters - go back through the major governments of the last 60 years and see how many had the majority of the popular vote. 

In the 'landslide' of '97 Blair got 43.2% of the votes, in '79 Thatcher got 43.9% in '50 Attlee got 46.1%, in 2010 Cameron got 36.1% (Clegg got 23%, but sadly as seats aren't allocated via PR he doesn't have that much clout in the Coalition).

So the governments have never had majority rule, yet they often completely dominate the parliament due to FPTP.

There is a veritable revolving door between the Met and the NoTW, Cameron and Murdoch &amp; Brooks. There is so much material out there that implicates massive conflicts of interest from the PM and his ministers that in other countries we would have grabbed the lot of them, a stout rope and headed towards the nearest lamp post.

Yesterdays deflection of ""We will wait until the Leveson Inquiry is over before acting on these accusations.."" WHAT THE FUCK! NO!

You dont fucking wait for months. If ~~Cunt~~ Hunt has been implicated in such a massive conflict of interest you immediately fucking remove him and bury him in a back office somewhere where he cant actually effect anything until these allegations are categorically proven or disproven. 

Also you can add Hunt's name besides Andy Coulson as people who the Prime Minister has said he ""takes full responsibility for"".

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;This is a shitty move, basically from what I can gather the company spent millions on R&amp;D and came up with something that wasn't good enough to replace an existing product, and instead of absorbing the risk themselves, they want the taxpayer to take on their risk.

Monoclonal antibodies are not new, they have been around for some years now. Bevacizumab was not originally developed to tackle Wet AMD, whereas Ranibizumab was, so it was in no way a replacement. It is actually different, and is more 'tailored' than Bevacisumab for Wet AMD.

&gt;When it comes to purchasing drugs, the NHS has a double-edged sword on its hands, as the largest Heathcare entity in the world it has enormous buying power, but on the other hand, companies that get into Novartis' situation they run the risk of bankrupting themselves

Unlikely, Novartis is effing huge. The problem comes when too many of their blockbuster drugs come off patent, and they don't have any more in the latter stages of development, but the bigger companies plan for this. 

&gt;I see this as bad forward planning and too much assumption on Novartis' part, they must be in seriously dire straits to take on the NHS when the evidence is against them.

That is one view, but I would disagree with it. As I said above it was never going to be a replacement for Bevacizumab because at the time of development it was not being used for Wet AMD and was not licensed for it, and still isn't licensed for it. There is no evidence against Novartis for anything, can you imagine the outcry if Bevacizumab started causing haemorrhaging in Wet-AMD patients and the media found out the NHS had routinely been giving out off license cheaper drugs?

He's also more detached from his companions, more closed off as a character.

This is best done at the SOFTWARE level. Why? Because any ""blacklist"" will always be out-of-date.   

With software you can detect key-words, you can blacklist, hell they even have code to detect a breast in an image now! Plus a blacklist at an ISP level will likely be per host name, so instead of blocking just wikipedia.org/breasts, you will block every page on wikipedia.      

So why blacklist at the ISP level? One very simple reason: This has NOTHING to do with keeping kids away from adult content and everything to do with keeping adults away from adult content.    

Essentially what they want to do is act as morality police and ""shame"" adults away from watching this content. For example you're married and your partner doesn't approve of porn, are you going to be able to call up and de-activate it? No!    

I am strongly against any kind of filtering. If these people don't want their kids browsing adult content then TAKE AWAY THEIR COMPUTER. Or move the computer into the living room where you can see what they're doing.

1. Louis van Gaal. A manager with an excellent track record, who plays attacking football and who, most of all, instills a WINNING MENTALITY in the squad. If we somehow scrape into the CL (or even if we don't), we HAVE to go for him.

2. Rafa Benítez. Say what you want about him, but his failings as Liverpool manager stemmed from his decision to strengthen the first XI at the expense of the squad in an attempt to go for the title, and it backfired on him. Yes, it was a bad move, but I think he's learned from it. As for the Inter job, taking over an ageing squad after Mourinho had just left was never going to end well, and the managerial changes since show that the problem at that club was not Benítez.

3. Roberto Martinez. His teams play in the right way, he is tactically astute, and the fact that his teams have managed to stay up three consecutive seasons against all odds shows his ability to inspire belief and confidence in the players.

4. Andre Villas-Boas. The problem for Villas-Boas would be that his stock has taken a hit in England given the Chelsea situation, and he would struggle to immediately command the respect of the players, especially those who have friends at Chelsea.



I don't want Moyes (4-6-0 is now a formation I want to see. I don't care if he's overachieved. Also his teams ALWAYS start the season so slowly), Rodgers (he needs to have success in more than ONE season in the top flight, and, for me, needs to work with a better team who have more of a cutting edge up front to show that he can truly be a success. Give him a couple of seasons at a club like Aston Villa and see if he can turn them around)

true,[deleted],null,null,"I disagree that atheism is a lack of belief.  

I would contend that atheism is a philosophical belief, and the philosophical viewpoint is that God doesn't exist or there are no Gods. There maybe variations on that viewpoint but that is the crux of it. I equate the opposite viewpoint to believers, they believe in the philosophy that there is a creator. It's two sides of the same argument. 

I believe God exists in peoples minds, and while people believe then God exists, to them, so literally God lives because people believe it. 

I'm quite happy to accomodate those who want to believe different viewpoints, its what makes the world go round, but when proposing to prevent others from believing what they like is a breach of their fundamental rights. This isn't my own view its the basis of the global charter of human rights set out by the United Nations and observed across the world. 

No-one is preventing you from having your [atheist meetings](http://www.meetup.com/London-Atheists/), joining up to your groups and [publishing your magazines](http://freethinker.co.uk/), but when I constantly see atheists propose preventing religious people from enjoying their lives comfortably I start to become intolerant.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;I disagree that atheism is a lack of belief.

You can disagree all you want:

http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=atheistic

It's not a debatable subject, it's fact. Atheism is simply the lack of belief.

&gt;I would contend that atheism is a philosophical belief, and the philosophical viewpoint is that God doesn't exist or there are no Gods. There maybe variations on that viewpoint but that is the crux of it. I equate the opposite viewpoint to believers, they believe in the philosophy that there is a creator. It's two sides of the same argument. 

No, it's not.

Atheism has one principle: That god, or gods do not exist.

Religion has everything from mythos relating to potentially fictional characters such as Abraham and Jesus, to what happens when you die, most religions have a strict doctrine that you should follow or you will be punished by this 'deity.'

Atheism does not, in any way, shape or form reflect on these, Life after death is not an atheistic issue, if someone tries to argue it is, they are simply wrong and should be ignored for tarring atheists with an ideology.

&gt;I believe God exists in peoples minds, and while people believe then God exists, to them, so literally God lives because people believe it. 

While I appreciate your viewpoint, this has some fallacy to it, you wouldn't say Santa exists would you? Or the Easter Bunny? For that reason alone you can't claim God exists because people have faith, you can claim the *concept* of God exists, but to go as far as saying he exists because of faith is illogical.

&gt;I'm quite happy to accomodate those who want to believe different viewpoints, its what makes the world go round, but when proposing to prevent others from believing what they like is a breach of their fundamental rights. This isn't my own view its the basis of the global charter of human rights set out by the United Nations and observed across the world. 

I agree with you whole heartedly. 
Belief and faith is a beautiful thing, I like to believe I will one day be a semi successful Music producer, I probably won't but it's a good thought that keeps me going.

People who reject God, such as me, but then try and force that view on Religious people are wrong. But at the same time, there are obviously fundamentalists in most religions who do the exact same thing.

Hell there's people who do the same thing for Political parties, I've had more than enough people come to my door demanding I vote Tory or Lib Dem, and when I tell them I'll be voting independant they get angry.

It's a human psychological reaction rather than an ideology, people don't like to be contradicited or proven wrong, so, especially with religion, this is a very, very prevailant act from both sides to almost aggresively try assert their point as fact.


&gt;No-one is preventing you from having your atheist meetings, joining up to your groups and publishing your magazines, but when I constantly see atheists propose preventing religious people from enjoying their lives comfortably I start to become intolerant. 

But then you've fallen in to the same trap those Atheists have. :)

Basically it's a vicious circle, you have religious extremists and fundamentalists who refuse to accept any other viewpoint aside from their (very) specific one, to the extent where it can get violent. 

The response to that is a growing sense of intolerence amongst atheists and people of other religious views, ""Why should we tolerate this crap when they cause so much shit?""

The result of that, is you now have those same feelings, but towards those atheists.

&gt;Atheism is simply the lack of belief, and a lack of tolerance towards the beliefs of others

Again wrong, well not wrong, but it's adding an emotional context to *all* atheists, which is as unfair as saying all Muslims are suicide bombers.

I'm a staunch atheist, as far as I'm concerned there is simply no deity, my views on anything else related to religion are my own personal views, I respect others beliefs on whether god exists - I obviously don't agree, but that's the glorious thing about a discussion, we're allowed to have different viewpoints and until someone can come up to me (or them) and say ""Look here's proof that God (doesn't) exists!"" then we're allowed to disagree.",0,1335440741,null,0,false,0,c4gt1kz,t3_ss2mw,t1_c4gt1kz,t1_c4gsx6o,null,1428799950,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You're idea that the rich are likely to benefit more is false as well, pretty much every asset has depreciated or given a return below inflation, leaving them worst off and holding cash loses at 5% a year. The difference is if you are rich inflation alone is unlikely to be something that worsens your lifestyle as you have more than enough money to deal with it.

The average pay rise is below inflation, but many public sector jobs, benefits and pensions are inflation linked. The argument is a valid one, but the problem is the current method of QE also keeps interest rates at rock bottom (buying tons of bonds, lowers their price) which keeps our economy from crashing, spend the money on infrastructure and the short term effects from the current method disappear and interest rates rise along with inflation which is disastrous. If interest rates were to raise by 1% now it would send the economy into a downward spiral pretty quickly.

I think that the key for the Doctor and his true name having power over him goes back to what I mentioned in the spoiler in my post (not revealing it here either, since some might think that's very big).  This would explain the whole reason why he was running in the first place and has always been uncomfortable on Gallifrey and around the Time Lords.  To have his past finally catching up with him in this way and the implications that would hold for him personally would be astronomical.

If River does indeed know his name, and therefore this aspect of his past, then that supposes that she has somehow been able to travel to that point -- something expressly forbidden by Time Lord law (especially .  I would assume this is because there is no record of him in this past (he's called ""the Other"" at this time).  That immediate trust could be from actually realizing who she was in his past and a vital role she may have played in it without his knowing it was her.

Saying anything else is tough because I don't want to give away the spoiler -- if you're interested in it, read *Lungbarrow* since that's over half the story.  I would love to see if they pull this into the upcoming season since that story line was a big part (actually a very detailed telling) of the Cartmel Masterplan that was never fully realized on screen.

&gt;They want their profit. Great. We don't want to give it to them. Ideally we'd get the drug for costs and Novartis would earn just enough to not go into bankruptcy. If you want capitalism then lets do it properly.

The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia 

1. That these matters that have taken place in the United States and whatever else is of their nature of plane hijackings and taking people hostage or killing innocent people, without a just cause, this is nothing but a manifestation of injustice, oppression and tyranny, which the Islamic Sharee’ah does not sanction or accept, rather it is expressly forbidden and it is amongst the greatest of sins. 

3. It is obligatory upon the Scolars of the Muslim Ummah that they explain the truth concerning the likes of these affairs (i.e. terrorist attacks) and that they make clear to the world at large that the Sharee’ah of Allaah and the religion of Islaam does not sanction these types of actions, ever. 

Grand Mufti of Egypt

&gt;Speaking after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Tantawy said ""It's not courage in any way to kill an innocent person, or to kill thousands of people, including men and women and children.""

&gt;He said that Osama bin Laden's call for a Jihad against the west was ""invalid and not binding on Muslims"", adding ""Killing innocent civilians is a horrific, hideous act that no religion can approve"". He said the Qur'an ""specifically forbids the kinds of things the Taliban and al-Qaida are guilty of"".

&gt;The people who did those attacks were acting for political motives, not religious reasons. However it is far easier to blame religion than to challenge our foreign policy, politics and the empire of the western war machine is responsible for a far greater death toll in the last hundred years than any religion. 

If you believe Breivik's attack was done for religious reasons you are quite wrong again he aligned himself with christianity, and considered himself a ""cultural christian"" 

&gt;which he says means preserving European culture, he notes ""It is enough that you are a Christian-agnostic or a Christian-atheist (an atheist who wants to preserve at least the basics of the European Christian cultural legacy...)""

**Furthermore, Breivik stated that ""myself and many more like me do not necessarily have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God.""**

He was a far-right muslim hating lunatic who believed the likes of Paul Ray and the Daily Mail and Melanie Philips in their sensationalization of islam as a bad religion. 

It is mostly always politics that causes the greatest and worst acts of violence, viciousness and depravity.

You may want to read this book, it's very short, it was written by the most decorated military commander in US history, Smedley Butler, while it was written in the 1930s it still resonates today.

The greatest evil in this world are politicians who order the killing innocent people in their beds IMO, and millions of them are killed at a time.

In this game you manage a team, say Spurs, and make team selections, training focus and match tactics and a lot of other things. I really recommend it, it's so much fun and fulfilling when things go your way (especially if you make that late substitution and they score to win you the game). You can't play as any of the player though, like in FIFA, you just sort of stand by the sideline and shout orders.

In Football Manager, ""M/AM L"" means that someone is a midfielder (M) and attacking midfielder (AM) on the left (L) side. So I kinda branded Bale as a ""Midfielder/Attacking Midfielder Left"". (In the real game I'm sure he'll be a ""Defender/Wing Back/Midfielder Left"" or something, I rarely play Spurs because I'm afraid to under-perform, like we've done in real life lately.)

I think it is also the kind of place you would go with other people, if you're on your own it might be a bit lonely. Also, a lot of those (apart from the bars really) are places I wouldn't suggest to a tourist that wants to see ""Irish"" stuff because they are just regular restaurants. 

Also I haven't read the suggestion for Brights, but it is I suppose a ""typical"" northern irish cafe but the smell of greasy fry-ups makes me want to vomit everytime I walk past it!

McHughes is a good bar, on the way over to the Titanic Quarter, when I went it had Irish musicians and I was like ""Oh yeah lets sit close to them"" - Wished I hadn't they kept getting out of sync of each other and looked like the most depressed bunch of people I've ever seen. I've seen them around Belfast before and they always look like they'd rather be anywhere else. It's a bit sad really.

Be wary of looking like a tourist for the sheer fact that you will be hounded by tour guides, and they are really rude. They will fight over you with other operators. (In fact one guy beat up another one a few months back and it was on the news) They are extremely annoying, but I would say this - if you are going on a tour check out the operators on TripAdvisor, I've heard bad things about Allen tours, simply being rushed and not long enough. They go up to the Causeway and such. And I would definitely suggest on deciding who your going with before hand, rather than just agreeing on the street as you will be swarmed by different operators trying to give you a better deal.

In regards to the politics thing, I've lived here all my life and am completely clueless to these things  and I've never been in a bad situation. Stay out of housing areas (In the sense that there's no bars/attractions) at night, but they will be fine in the day time just passing through. Obviously just don't ask people to take your pictures beside murals etc. 

And now, I would say a shop you MUST visit is [The Wicker Man.](http://www.thewickerman.co.uk/) It is personally my favourite Irish shop. It is not a gimmicky shop like Carroll's that sells T-shirts at jacked up prices. But it hosts a lot of Irish Artists work and sells lots of handcrafting ornaments, instruments and Jewelry. It really is fantastic, and the staff are lovely and helpful and can tell you alot about the things they sell.

If I can think of any more tips, I'll add them later.

I also repeat the previous point that it consume more energy to recycle plastic than to create it fresh. 

Paper should be recycled while plastic should not be recycled but simply squashed and damped so that it may be used in future when more energy efficient recycle method is developed. Plastic recycling and wind/solar energy are examples of supposedly Green policies which is more about symbolism than actually saving environment.

That's hand-wringing that will never reduce the number of deaths. And I don't see how we're talking about a theory either - there have been more than enough reports of lives lost taking the surrounding islands, as well as the actions of the Japanese government, to say nothing of having to drop a *second* bomb. Offer those families you mentioned the choice of 50,000 deaths, or half a million, with no opt out - which would they choose?

&gt;I believe it is just as evil to kill innocent people from a war plane as it is to fly planes into a building.

Christianty obviously covers everything from the Church of England to Quakers, and in similar fashion Atheism will cover people who outright reject the notion of God(s) (I'd probably say this is what you define as 'strong' atheism?) who will actively try prove that there is no God.


While at the same time Atheism will cover people like me, who simply have no belief, I don't accept the concept of God due to being pragmatically minded and God as a concept does not fit into that thought process, and in some respects undermines it.

So basically I guess I do agree with you to an extent, as much as I would like atheism to not share any relation with organised religion, I think it's unavoidable as it's human nature to naturally group up around core concepts and social cliques.

Realistically the rate should be around 2% which would mean quadrupling every interest only mortgage in the country, but seeing as that would bankrupt too many people who over leveraged themselves in the easy credit boom years, instead they are being subsidised by everybody else via inflation to keep afloat whilst the debt is slowly inflated away. Although average wage rises are below inflation, they are still above interest rates by a long way, 0.5% interest rates Vs 3% base wage rises Vs 5% inflation last year. If interest rates rose you would not expect a pay rise in line with them much like you don't expect or get a cut when they drop, whereas with inflation you would expect one or you would feel ripped off, like you do at the moment without one. 

TL;DR you are better of because interest rates are being held at record lows meaning that are paying roughly a quarter of what you should be, whilst inflation erodes the value of all money by an equally high percentage meaning those with the largest debts are benefiting from the largest erosion of value.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, you’re not an atheist then, unless you re-define the terms (incidentally, I think the redefinition of ‘weak-atheism’ is a pretty transparent attempt by some ‘strong-‘atheists to capture more territory, and not really very defensible - one could equally call the position weak-theist’ (as one doesn’t actually reject the existence of god), which shows the silliness….) 

To be honest, I sometimes refrain from calling myself an ‘atheist’ because I don’t believe the proposition that there is no god, because I don’t understand what ‘god’ means (or rather, I think I do, but it seems very silly, and then theists say 'oh no, we didn't mean quite *that*). So I neither accept or reject the claim people take to be definitive of theism or atheism. That rules me out of atheism. However, it’s not like I think there actually is a sensible way to understand the term – I suspect people are muddled. So I reject that there is a sensible coherent concept there. That pretty much makes me a fellow traveller to most atheists. But still, rejecting the concept isn’t the same as rejecting the existence of anything falling under the concept.

What does annoy me is when people say things like ‘we were all atheist when we were born’ – no, we weren’t, in the sense that children don’t reject the existence of god because they also can’t even begin to grasp the claim that god exists.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Atheism has one principle: That god, or gods do not exist.

Which is a belief. A strongly held belief. A belief as strongly held as someone who believes in God. You did say staunch right?

The dictionary definition is written in a very cunning way, and it is deliberately written in a way that suggests you hold no belief. Everything should be challengable and debatable, and I believe that the dictionary definition is written in a way that avoids challenge. 

Holding a belief that ""gods do not exist, or there is no God"" is a philosophical view. If we look at the definition of philosophy

**philosophy**

**The rational investigation of questions about existence**  and knowledge and ethics

Atheism is very much a rational investigation of questions about existence and knowledge and ethics. 

Let's take the foghorn of modern atheism  Richard Dawkins 

(Clearly the great philosopher of the modern age - which I believe he how he would like to style himself, hes not just any old bookseller)   

This is how he sums up his organisation.

*The mission of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science is to support scientific education, critical thinking and evidence-based understanding of the natural world in the quest to overcome religious fundamentalism, superstition, intolerance and suffering*.

It fits nice and squarely into the categorical definition.

Overcoming religious fundamentalism with atheist bigotry and a vast army of militant haters who hang off his every word, buy his books in the millions and sell out his tours. Nice one Dawkins that will make for a better world, right? How to win friends and have loads of money. 

Modern atheism is beginning to smell very much like a militant anti-religious belief system, check out r/atheism any time of the day or night and you will see constant attacks and criticism of the beliefs of others, they post up their criticism of others on the social networks and slap each other on the back. 
 
Those you call atheist fundamentalists, look to me like the same kind of bigots as religious fundamentalists, highly critical of others and showing a distinct lack of subtlety, humour and respect. 

now clearly this statement sets you apart.

""I respect others beliefs on whether god exists""

When I see people attacking the religious beliefs want religious education banned and faith schools stopped, then I'm afraid I start to believe that while I have no issue with atheism per sé, it is the right of others to think what they want, it must apply across the board or it becomes a form of fascism.

&gt; you can claim the concept of God exists, but to go as far as saying he exists 

What is God if its not a concept? 

As far as I can tell God isn't described as a he because that assumes a sex , but in manifestations and prophets. The closest christianity gets is Jesus, but Jesus alone is a single element of the holy trinity, so describing God in any kind of terms that invoke a living creation in the terms we understand (likes like captain birds eye without the uniform) would be incorrect.

Until proof is made God lives in peoples minds and is real because they believe in as you say in the concept of God. It is that belief that causes God to be real, and is it your lack of belief that causes God to not be real. These are two opposite philosophical viewpoints about existence. 

The reason why you cannot simply stop at atheism being ""a lack of belief in God"" is very much because theists derive the beginning of existence as being of the work of God(s), atheists by the very fact that they don't believe in Gods must believe that the beginning of existence cannot have been created by Gods, therefore it becomes a philosophical viewpoint. 

There is no proof or evidence either way, these philosophies are just that, strongly held philosophical belief system that carry no actual evidential proof. ",0,1335448178,null,0,false,0,c4gu0gu,t3_ss2mw,t1_c4gu0gu,t1_c4gt1kz,null,1428800406,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Gary Neville said there was no contact, but the tackle itself pretty much begged for the opponent to go down and claim it. I think that was also partly why Lampard and Fabregas had a rather heated moment afterwards...he went down easily again for another challenge, which then led to Lampard being infuriated and them shoving each other around.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Well, you’re not an atheist then, unless you re-define the terms (incidentally, I think the redefinition of ‘weak-atheism’ is a pretty transparent attempt by some ‘strong-‘atheists to capture more territory, and not really very defensible - one could equally call the position weak-theist’ (as one doesn’t actually reject the existence of god), which shows the silliness….) 

So your saying because I don't try force others to believe what I believe I'm not an atheist? Riiiiiiight. There's a difference between being arrogant and being an atheist.

&gt;To be honest, I sometimes refrain from calling myself an ‘atheist’ because I don’t believe the proposition that there is no god, because I don’t understand what ‘god’ means (or rather, I think I do, but it seems very silly, and then theists say 'oh no, we didn't mean quite that). So I neither accept or reject the claim people take to be definitive of theism or atheism. That rules me out of atheism. However, it’s not like I think there actually is a sensible way to understand the term – I suspect people are muddled. So I reject that there is a sensible coherent concept there. That pretty much makes me a fellow traveller to most atheists. But still, rejecting the concept isn’t the same as rejecting the existence of anything falling under the concept.

Actually it's a very simply question,

Do you believe in God?

Yes - Theist

No - Atheist

Unsure - Agnostic



&gt;What does annoy me is when people say things like ‘we were all atheist when we were born’ – no, we weren’t, in the sense that children don’t reject the existence of god because they also can’t even begin to grasp the claim that god exists.

Absolutely not. Don't be sarcastic if you're going to go in for misreading. You said:

&gt; While at the same time Atheism will cover people like me, who simply have no belief

As the definition you quoted shows, not having belief is not sufficient for being an atheist. So if that's *all* you have (implied by your use of the word 'simply'), you're not an atheist. That's why I say you're not an atheist - you've made comments inconsistent with being one (although it's possible you are an atheist, and are just inconsistent - I was charitably assuming you weren't inconsistent).",0,1335453565,null,0,true,0,c4gv1tn,t3_ss2mw,t1_c4gv1tn,t1_c4guz08,null,1428800899,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So really, companies have had plenty of time to re-engineer the way cookies are used on their websites and give the user the ability to 'opt-in' to the use of cookies. This is not difficult.

The legislation only applies to cookies that are not essential to the running of or affect the use of the website: e.g. tracking cookies used for affiliate programs, cookies used for analytics purposes etc...It also limits the use of cookies with ridiculous expiry dates (I've seen some that expire 10-20 years in the future) and those that gather information which is deemed as private.

Where a cookie is used and it's not essential to the function of the website, the website must now give users the ability to 'opt in', by way of a pop-up or something similar. The [ICO](http://www.ico.gov.uk/) currently do this, although it looks a bit messy.

Where the use of cookies is essential to the function of the website: e.g. internet banking, online shopping baskets etc, there is no change. The user should just be made aware that cookies will be used to ensure the banking/shopping experience is not interrupted.

&gt;Modern atheism is beginning to smell very much like a militant anti-religious belief system, check out r/atheism any time of the day or night and you will see constant attacks and criticism of the beliefs of others, they post up their criticism of others on the social networks and slap each other on the back. 

I wouldn't label it as 'modern atheism' just in the same way I wouldn't label muslim extremists as 'modern muslims' I don't endorse eithers actions, bigotted hate, whatever the motive is wrong.

&gt;When I see people attacking the religious beliefs want religious education banned and faith schools stopped, then I'm afraid I start to believe that while I have no issue with atheism per sé, it is the right of others to think what they want, it must apply across the board or it becomes a form of fascism.

Agreed, I think the issue comes from the minorities on both sides, you have people like the West Borough Baptist Church who spread christian hate message across america, but at the same time you have atheists doing the same, it's disgusting either way, I agree that belief is a universal thing, if you want yours to be accepted you must first accept others.

&gt;Until proof is made God lives in peoples minds and is real because they believe in as you say in the concept of God. It is that belief that causes God to be real, and is it your lack of belief that causes God to not be real. These are two opposite philosophical viewpoints about existence. 

I think my problem was I took the original statement far too literally, as a concept sure God exists, however I thought it was meant in a literal sense, as in he/she/it literally exists, somewhere. So for that I apologise. 

&gt;There is no proof or evidence either way, these philosophies are just that, strongly held philosophical belief system that carry no actual evidential proof.

true,bowertrot,null,null,"As far as I know it's not the case in Oxford. Out of all my friends it seems to be the most expensive place, especially when the clubs (well, the ones I've been to) are even worse value for money. If you manage to control your finances, though (and that's simply resisting impulse purchases, don't spend stupidly on clothes, and prelash more than actually buy drinks when out), then the costliness of living in Oxford would be no more than just something that pisses you off.

The college bars are great though, and I really like going on college bar crawls, as long as you have members of the colleges let you in (except Baliol where you could be running in naked with a sledgehammer in your hands and the porters would welcome you in with open arms).

&gt; Is it easy to keep a work-social life balance?

That's a tough question to answer. It depends on where you define that balance. For me, personally (which obviously might a meaningless response), I was really scared about not being able to have the nights out and parties like I've had consistently since I was about 15. I've always known when I've had to make sacrifices. and have done so accordingly and successfully. Now being at Oxford I have found that I have had to make the sacrifices that I was worried about initially. I spend most of my time working and time for going out and getting pissed is far inferior to that. The thing is, I don't mind that though because:

A) I do actually enjoy studying and want to do the best I can.

B) The nights out don't really compare to some I've had in the past. If people did have personal parties more (i.e. not club night but room/house party) then I reckon I would be more content, but I don't have to apply much self-discipline to not go out (if any).

I guess how I would try apply that response specifically to you is that if you also happen to achieve point A, you will be happy will whatever balance you find. And regardless of if you do achieve that, you will adapt to whatever situation you are in.

I hope that's of somewhat help.

**Edit:**

* My other favourite thing to bar crawls are crewdates.

* I cannot pinpoint an exact cost on a night out. Say typically for me, I would go through maybe half a bottle of JD/Morgan's (although a lot of the time more) in the prelash, then pay to get into the club, possible buy another drink in a club, and a mandatory kebab on the way back if I'm drunk enough. That would total to ~8 + 5 + 4.50 + 3.50 = ~£21.

* There are cheaper places outside the centre, and they're also less studenty (such as Cowley). I actually like going here, but most groups seem to be stuck in the typical club routine: Monday: Wahoo - Tuesday: Camera - Wednesday: Park End - Thursday: Bridge - Friday: Camera - Saturday: Number Nine.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I think Torres/Drogba is still a potent attack force. Torres would get the majority of games, and Drogba would remain first choice for the ""big games"". Sturridge could be the third centre forward if necessary. If we sign more proper wingers, we should see their productivity increase.

I agree with seeing Kalou and Malouda leave, on the condition that we sign more quality wingers. Otherwise I think maybe Kalou still have a place in the team.

Bosingwa has been better of late, but it's been two consecutive poor seasons now. We need to improve in this area, and Ferreira is getting too old unfortunately. We need to bring in someone to cover Ivanovic now or at least for the future.

For RB, I would like to see someone with pace and who posses a strong defensive game. I can't comment on anyone that you listed, I've only heard things about their offensive game, but I will add that Nathaniel Clyne of Crystal Palace is young, pacey and pretty highly touted for his age.

We need to assess Bertrand and Patrick van Aanholt this summer. Cole has looked out of form for the majority of the season, and a long-term replacement is quickly becoming a priority. We need to be sure either one of them can take over for him.

We need a left and right winger. Hazard and Muniain are my two options, I believe Muniain is mostly right sided, whereas Hazard is capable of playing both sides. Along with potentially allowing one or two youngsters to stay with the first team (KdB, Kakuta), and maybe holding onto Kalou, we should have the proper depth. We should try to move Mata into the CAM role permanently. I'm conflicted on whether we should keep Ramires as a RW.

If we can do that, we shouldn't need to sign another one. We have Benayoun coming back on loan, if he can accept a depth role we're set, especially with KdB, Kakuta and Piazon able to play in this role. If we do need to sign someone short-term, maybe Kaka if he's available at a cut-rate price? His performances have generally been poor of late, so maybe Madrid would part with him for less. Big name, experienced, and should get on well with the Portuguese/Brazilian contingent.

Maybe consider signing another energy midfield, like Cheik Tiote (Newcastle) or Yann M'Vila (Rennes), as Essien and Meireles have mostly been mediocre this season.

I'd stick with the 4-2-3-1, I think Lampard is finally settling into the deeper role.

Here's the speech,

&gt;Hi,

&gt;I am a concerned citizen, a digital native, as well as a productive member of society who would like to participate in the digital debate. 

&gt;I've recently been made aware of your push for filtering the internet on ISP level and was wondering how exactly you're planning to put in motion such a difficult feat, as well as your level of expertise in the matter. In your ""Meet Andrea"" section it has caught my eye that you used to work in the Financial sector, I'm wondering how that experience ties in with your push for filtering the internet on ISP level. 

&gt;The fact of the matter is, this will be a futile attempt at gaining control of neglected children's online habits. Children born in the digital age (digital natives) are so much more adept at bending the rules than digital migrants (older people who were introduced to the digital world later on in their life), and I have no doubts that these digital natives will outsmart such attempt to control their online habits. 

&gt;I also can't help but think this gives way too much power and control to the government.

&gt;Instead, I believe we should push our resources, our energy and time for better digital education, as well as rebuilding the long lost art of parenting skills.

&gt;In your ""Meet Andrea"" section, you also mention that you would like to see ""parents responsible for their children"" and that ""A government imposing beliefs from above is an out of date method of politics"".

&gt;Let's do that then shall we?

&gt;Looking forward to your reply regarding this matter.

&gt;Have a good day, and thank you for your work in representing the people in the Parliament.  ",0,1335460346,null,0,false,0,c4gwizg,t3_stb3i,t1_c4gwizg,t1_c4gwfsq,null,1428801679,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Another guy posted the same thing in /r/Soccer and people who were watching the match on shitty streams immediately downvoted him to hell and that post never got any attention. 

Fabregas also thinks he is such tough shit. The reason Lampard keeps his cool is because he knew he had a responsibility to continue and be a part of the 10 men team which was already struggling. Also because he is a classy guy and doesn't bother with such daft cunts.

If Lampard were to lash out at Fabregas or that prick Messi who shoved him in the chest after Fabregas tried to bring Lampard down with his arms wrapped around Frank's legs, then all their 2 seconds of manliness would come crashing down to earth. 

Lampard alone can take on Fabregas and Messi, whichever one of them thinks they are tough shit. Then the Barcelona team will step up to ""defend"" their players but as soon as Mikel or Ivanovic will touch them , they would roll around clutching their face and wait for the referee to do something.

There was no waste. It was intended abuse of the regulatory system and the NHS is telling them to fuck off.


No what happened was Lucentis was trialled and found to be very effective for Wet AMD. Given that Avastin and Lucentis are derived from the same monoclonal antibody, some researchers started looking at Avastin to see if it could treat Wet AMD in the same way, by injection into the eyes, due to its availability and lower cost. 

Companies make second and third generation drugs, usually more improved or effective, they 'tweak' them. No abuse, just standard research.

A. Looking like a gimmick and effectively making the show jump the shark and 

B. Not make it a huge problem for the show.

Because, referring to A, this is pretty much a popular long-running show doing something it never did before for very little sake.

I mean, what's gained by making the Doctor female? Gender's never really been a big part of his character. If anything, it's something you're kind of supposed to ignore. He's not ""a man"" he's ""the Doctor"". He sort of goes beyond gender and him being a he is just sort of a background event. It's not something you draw attention to.

But if you suddenly after 50 years of ignoring his gender suddenly bring it to the forefront, you've made a Doctor about gender.

I don't think this has anything to be with him/her becoming suddenly female, I think it's the fact that it's changed that's really odd.

I think that a gender transition would only serve as a distraction for the Doctor's audiences than anything else. It's a wonderful gesture to the female/gender right groups, but it's a hollow one.

I maen, what are they going to do? Have the Doctor suddenly like men? We've already seen that the Doctor's not big on relationships, but he's by no means straight. He even flirts with Jack a bit and accepts his emotional kiss in Parting of the Ways. He's never been too interested in any one particular sex, really. Even his relationships with Rose and River haven't really been about sex so much as how he loved their personalities and outlooks.

Bottom line: if you have the Doctor start flirting with men, it's going to look like your suddenly sexualizing the character because he's female, as if now that he's a woman sex has to come to the forefront.

But on the other hand, do you just ignore it? 

People are going to ask ""wasn't the Doctor a dude?"" and you're going to have to have him/her address old friends and in general help the audience transition through the sheer unwarranted wackiness that is a sudden gender-swap.

And even if we were to ignore all of the in-world ramificatios of the Doctor suddenly changing gender, in the Whoniverse itself we have no indication that the Doctor even *could* make the change.

He thinks that he's a girl (based on hair length, mind you) while so delusional he's marveling at his legs and fingers and has no idea who he is. Hardly solid indication that this is actually possible.

And then we have his offhanded mention of the Corsair, which you erroneously claim ""canonizes"" the Doctor being able to become a woman.

In fact, we have no idea how or under what circumstances The corsair made the change under. It's possible that it was not regeneration, or further still that only a select few Time Lords are capable of it.

Presuming that it's a fifty-fifty chance and taking into account that for his eleven consecutive regenerations the Doctor has made against his will and his surprise at his later appearance I'd say that the odds of him becoming female in-Whoniverse are rather low.

My point is that I can't see the Doctor becoming a woman as anything more than the show jumping the shark. It's the ultimate way of saying ""well, we've run out of ideas.

Wingers- KDB, and Piazon should go loan to a EPL club that will guarantee playing time. 
Kakuta looked good in his first few games at Dijon but he's been fading quickly. Assess him in the summer.
I would like Muniain instead of Hazard. Think there will be too much competition for him and that will raise his price. But if we beat Munich who knows what will happen. 

CF/ST- I don't think we should sign any. Keep Drogba, play Torres as starter with Sturridge rotating in. Send Lukaku on loan. 

MF- I like SG's picks of Cheik Tiote or Yann M'Vila. Essien is aging quickly, and Meireles isn't going to give you a great game everytime he's played. Test McEachren this summer see how he is, most likely see him being loaned again.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;When it comes to death I prefer to hear the views of the victims not the perpetrators. 

Isn't that a bit playground-monitor justice? As in, whoever got hurt the least is guilty? For example, why not ask the residents of Nan-King about how they were treated by the Japanese, who killed 250 - 300,000 only eight years earlier?

&gt;The state decided to kill innocents in one fell swoop than fight on the battlefield. 

The innocents who have been taught *en masse* to believe you're the devil, will kill their children (etc.) and will fight to almost the last man as they did on some of the surrounding islands? And you're not conisdering the number-of-deaths being so much greater.

&gt;I believe more warnings could have been given about the type of weapon that was about to be used at Potsdam. 

If you mean the Potsdam Declaration, they used radio and leaflet drops, and as a result most Japanese were aware of the ultimatum - to then procrastinate doesn't make it much of an ultimatum.

&gt;More diplomacy maybe could have taken place. They were not warned that nuclear bombs were going to be dropped.

War tends to mean you're past diplomacy - they gambled to dictate terms that they already knew weren't on offer.

&gt;Hirohito and his government were already considering surrender. 

And yet half his cabinet were plotting a coup in order to carry on fighting rather than surrender *after the first bomb had dropped*. Going back to the diplomacy point, if that's not a clear enough indication that the allies' fears of the cost of an invasion were accurate enough, I'm not sure you'd ever be convinced.

&gt;Had Americans been in the position of the Japanese they would not be accepting for such an inhumane act.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"You see, as much as I'd like to see the Doctor make such a progressive change like changing gender, at this point in Doctor Who, after eleven consecutive male regenerations, I cannot see this being anything other than a gimmick.

I mean really, this would be the show jumping the shark. It would be producers looking at the Doctor and going ""well, we're out of ideas. Let's just slap some tits on him and call it a day"".

Because really, that's all it would be. Why else would you choose a female Doctor if the Doctor's never really been *any* gender?

Honestly, the Doctor's gender is something you're supposed to *forget about*. It's something that's just kind of there and not a big part of the story. He's never been ""manly"", he's never really been ""a man"". He's just ""the Doctor"". He's an archetype, he's something else entirely. You aren't supposed to see the Doctor in terms of gender.

So when you make the sudden and very much unwarranted gender change, it brings gender terms to light. Suddenly you realize that this Doctor is a woman and the other Doctor's were men. It's taking the subject of gender and tearing it from the background and tossing it into the limelight for no reason other than making a gesture of progress.

But that gesture's empty. It doesn't actually progress Doctor Who at all. If you focus on it with ""remembering growing up as a little boy"" or gaining attraction to a Rory-proxy then you're not portraying the Doctor, because the Doctor was never like that. You're bringing not just gender, but now sex into the equation when the Doctor's not about sex.

And to top this off, we have no guarantee that the Doctor  even *could* make this change. All we know is that one time Lord has done it before, and even then we have no guarantee that that was a natural cause or some other event influencing that.

Basically a gender change is the joke that you make when you've run out of good jokes. It's the low-level sexism found in Z-Grade comedies. It's really a change that is not possible in this stage of Doctor Who because it honestly couldn't look like anything other than a ridiculous stunt.",0,1335468073,null,0,false,0,c4gy8ze,t3_stz3w,t1_c4gy8ze,t3_stz3w,null,1435718729,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Yes, there is an artistic turn, and I believe it's for the better.

The cinematography, the wardrobe, the set design, it's all taken this more advanced look and feel with focus-shifting and atypical shooting techniques (although I feel that a few things like Rory's phone-camera shutter lens deal in Eleventh Hour and the Doctor's ""Sherlock Scan"" in A Christmas Carol was a bit much).

I'm not into Amy. If you notice, Rory shows a lot of promise, but is woefully underused. Almost every line he has is about either bending to Amy's will, or trying to save Amy. It's a pity he's used as a satellite character, because in glimpses you see a brilliant performance from a potentially brilliant character.

Amy's character's a bit one-dimensional. She takes the most annoying bits of Donna like ignoring the Doctor's warnings and acting entitled and all the worst elements of Rose like her loose relationship with Mickey and her pining for the Doctor and cranks them up to Eleven.

Where Donna would jokingly rib the Doctor after a while of knowing him, Amy will outright ignore the Doctor at some moments and burst out into full-on spoiled in others (her ""Do you know who I am? I'm *AMY POND*."" speil in Cold Blood was *agonizing*), and while Rose would be a bit flirtatious as she's already in a loose relationship with Mickey, Amy will run off with the Doctor (intentionally hiding her wedding ring) and then *snog the living fuck out of him* while a man *totally devoted to her* is completely unaware of the affair.

And as to losing the TARDIS, it only gets painful in Curse of the Black Spot when Eleven goes ""Oh the TARDIS, my home and only method of transport and sole relic of my long-dead species, is going to dematerialize to literally any point in time and space and I'm almost completely assured to never see her again if we part now. Let's get out.""

Otherwise, separating the Doctor from the TARDIS is a bit key (otherwise you have the question of ""why don't they all just escape in the TARDIS"" hanging over the episode) and to their benefit they (mostly) work it in in a natural way.

Remember, the first seasons of Seinfeld and The Next Generation and so many other great shows were awful. Luckily the show gets better rather quickly.

The ""billion"" thing is pretty unrealistic and shows a *massive* lack of scale in the Whoniverse, but things get better.

Watch the third episode in which they meet Charles Dickens (its more enjoyable than the first two *by far*).

If *that* doesn't reel you in, press on to the Empty Child. That's one of Eccleston's best.

If ***even that*** doesn't meet your fancy, jump to The Eleventh Hour and watch onward from there. Production values go *way* up and the artistic style of the show becomes more refined (although some will argue that the writing isn't as good as series prior).

* The Unquiet Dead (not phenomenal, but certainly enjoyable. Weightier than episodes prior)

* Aliens in London/World War Three (is actually rathe rgood once you get past the Slitheen)

I would say that it became a ""superpower"" in the 18th century, with it being an extremely powerful naval force and in control of a lot of land in the Americas. Wikipedia puts the British Empire's height at 1922, when it controlled 22.63% of the world's land and 20% of its population. After that, it began to lose colonies and thus decline in power.

As for the USA, it was an isolationist country until the first world war, but gained considerable clout during and after it. Many of the old empires were collapsing at this point, and I'd say the USA truly became a superpower during the second world war, partly due to its development of the atomic bomb, and in the beginnings of the cold war immediately afterwards.

Drug dealers would pay tax if it was legal just like the off license does. 

I came unstuck in your eyes, we're not dealing with absolutes here. It is illogical to ban certain drugs which aren't especially dangerous like mdma or weed whilst allowing one of the most dangerous drugs there are to be served almost everywhere in alcohol. It is illogical. Secondly, I consider it immoral to destroy peoples lives who have done nothing to hurt anyone else other than to smoke a plant to get a buzz instead of sipping from the governments endorsed drug of choice. Even coffee is a mind altering narcotic, or do you like that one? Why should people be jailed for preferring different things to you? 

Pretty obvious, that's weird, maybe you should go and ask Portugal about why they removed all drug laws for personal use. Or maybe look into what happened when alcohol was banned in the states. Or why all of latin america is appealing for the end of the war on drugs. Or why leading researchers like Professor Nutt endorse legalisation. Prohibition solves nothing and causes significantly greater harms whilst wasting police, courts and real peoples lives. 

16,000 people died due to alcohol last year, what about all of these lives that tesco and the government are profiting from. Where is your outrage for them. It's inconsistent as hell. 

And gangster rap, really? This is just some age old moral panic from people who don't understand something or feel threatened. The catholic church banned chord sequences because they were the sound of the devil. Judas Priest had to go to court defending their lyrics in the 80's. electric guitars were meant to be a horrible influence. Marlyn Manson was to blame for Colombine as well clearly. Almost every type of music going gets blamed for something, it's unmitigated rubbish. 

The dude was just trying to make his and his families life better, the same as everyone else. It's quite likely he didn't have great opportunities, as many poor people don't.

You basically have the options of:

- ADSL from a large range of suppliers down a BT phone line.

- ADSL from a smaller number of suppliers down their phone line e.g. Sky.

- Virgin cable, if you live in a cable area.

Unfortunately recommending broadband, or taking recommendations, is tricky because it varies considerably. While some of the reliability etc is down to the specific provider, far more significant are the variables that aren't e.g. your local exchange, your distance to the exchange, quality of your wiring... Then there's the bit-torrent and other heavy users who may suffer from throttling which doesn't affect lighter users. 

I use BE There and get an excellent connection with good speeds and gaming ping (typically one of the best), though I do keep secondary DNS IP's handy as they do seem to have more than their share of DNS issues. But then I'm a stone's throw from a city-centre exchange...

To those (like Palmtreez below) who feel offended by this, do you *really* think, that we don't care?  The appeal (for me at least) of this humour is based on the empathy we have for the case (added to the luxury of it being distant).

People are sufferring, will always suffer and we are *powerless* to do anything.  If that's not enough, there's the media saturation of the story, which trivalises larger(or long term) issues; we are told to feel grief, or to act like the cast of scooby doo, depending on the circumstances.  Mostly I don't feel these things.  There's just horror. 

 The whole machine's a mess, and people get a laugh.  A harmless laugh.

You see this is where all these life-cycle studies appear to go awry.  Yes if you produce glossy white paper and print heavy inks on to them and add varnish you produce a lot of toxic waste. But you can use vegetable based inks on non-bleached paper that's [almost] 100% recycled and your far away from producing the same level of environmental impact.

Page 16 of the linked Dep. Eng. document from Cambridge Uni, 2005 figures, says that energy required for production of the recycled plastics is from 75% to about 50% (on a quick glance) of that to make virgin plastics.

The link on plastic bags vs paper bags says that paper is better for high proportion of recycling but with lower proportion of recycling plastic is better.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"If the police genuinely believe that someone has or had a gun, they should use the force necessary to remove the perceived threat. 

And that is where the problem comes, because people don't put themselves in the position of a copper believing lives are in danger, they see a guy without a gun and judge based upon that, which is right to do to a point, but people over simplify it and make judgements based upon prejudices against the police too. 

If a copper with a gun tells you to do the moonwalk (bad reference here to a story I saw elsewhere on Reddit), you should do it. You shouldn't do it because you are being subservient to the cops or anything like that, you should do it because you have no idea what information (right or wrong) those cops have. Some twat may have told them you've just threatened them with a gun, if you get all arsey (for whatever reason), they should feel threatened and shoot you, it's down to the threat that they themselves feel, whether or not that threat even exists, if they are justified in feeling it, they can and should shoot. 

The police cannot win, they're always going to be get slated no matter what they do. They don't go out to kill people, but sometimes they will have to even if that person actually posed no threat to them, their safety and the safety of others has to come first, and sometimes that means shooting people. 

So the next time a copper asks or tells you to do something, do it. Don't do it because you respect the cops, because many of you don't, do it because it might just save your life, because you don't know what information they've been told about you.

true,NebraskaBLUES,null,null,"How has everyone forgotten Modric? We all remember the saga that developed over trying to sign him but his contract with Spurs is up after this season correct? And if I remember right he was very interested in playing for Chelsea.

 and with (confident and hopeful) an FA cup title, UCL title, and automatic bid for next year regardless of our final position this year (which very well could be top 4, I think it will be) with all of this I have to think that Chelsea would be a very attractive place to play.

I know Modric has been shown a lot of interest from City and United, but I still think if/when our dream scenario plays out we have to be considered an EPL title contender and a fearsome matchup for anyone in Europe.  Who knows who else could come out of the woodwork if we continue our winning ways. 

I think we can all agree that we don't necessarily need to bring in a veteran anywhere.  In my opinion this is why Chelsea should be the most attractive destination for any youth player.  We have the luxury of 5 SOLID and I mean SOLID defenders in (Terry, Cole, Luiz, Cahill, Iva).  We have Lampard as the midfield leader with Mata and Ramires workhorses who never seem to quit.  And we all know Drogba is an elite player who is a force to be reckoned with for any defenders including our own. But also people need to start respecting the talents of Torres, he always seems to find himself in the mix goal scoring, passing, whatever it is and he's a workhorse himself.

We've got the luxury of a veteran top class goalie and a whole handful of the perfect teachers for any significant and serious young players. ",0,1335481594,null,0,false,0,c4h18pb,t3_stnqc,t1_c4h18pb,t3_stnqc,null,1428803887,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Next, you find that due to the make of your car, or the miles you drive, that you are not permitted to use it.

And finally, the carpark is turned into housing, as the council has found that nobody is using it.

You see a meme? You downvote it like the democratic denizen of Reddit you are and you *never look at it ever again*.

That's the system here. Don't like it? Goodbye meme to the firey pits of Tartarus.

As it's already been mentioned by most of you we need to bring in a Right Back, even it's just someone to cover for Ivanovic. However. other than this I would say we'd be fine signing two attackers/wingers. My personal choices would be Kagawa as well as Jovetic, but if these two are viewed as being too central then I'd like to see us bring in someone like Munian or perhaps Lavezzi?

His death was completely unnecessary and allowing the police to continually make mistakes like this without correct oversight is downright dangerous for everyone.

Some science fiction is focused on the ""nuts and bolts"" science part of it. Call it science fiction for engineers. Doctor Who is NOT that type of show.

Doctor Who takes the science part of it and jumps WAY past the nuts and bolts and into theoretical quantum physics. The science part of it only has to deal with inter-dimensional applications, and since we are stuck with limited  3-D perception, we probably wouldn't get it anyway.

Yeah, the Doctor could be doing anything in any order but the audience is generally given the feeling that we're seeing the Doctor's life in order. We are not, however, seeing River's life in order. The reason she gets less mature is because she is getting younger and younger every time we see her. But there's a whole journal of things the Doctor and River song do that we've only seen about three or four of. 

The Doctor and River Song may or may not have had sex, I don't argue that point. But I don't think that the Doctor doesn't love River, I think he cares very much for her. Their relationship will just always be difficult because it's all out of order. I think right now we're mainly seeing the part where River's already lived most of it, and the Doctor hasn't.

FSG aren't as cash rich as FSG and didn't buy LFC to be a ""toy"" like Abramovich's Chelsea or Mansour's Man City. the club was bought to run like a business. FSG made that clear from the get-go. What they also made clear was that FSG wanted to buy young( and apparently British) and build for the future. At 28 Meireles didn't fit their mold anyway. They could care less if he left. 

Another is club politics.  Meireles wasn't the purchase of anyone still at the club when it came time to re-negotiate his contract. So no one was *really* going to stick their neck out and vouch for him on a personal level.  Instead of re-upping his contract for a further  4 years that would run out when he was 32 they wanted to keep it whatever it was (reportedly 30k a week). When that didn't work he left for Chelsea. Good luck to him, whatever. When the contract discussion stalled they went out and snapped up Charlie Adam who was British and a bit younger. That hasn't worked out but what were they supposed to do? Be held hostage by a player none of them signed and toss their ""moneyball"" idea out the window?  

Also FSG aren't even close to being as cash rich as Abramovich or Mansour. Why burden the club with debt for a player who only wanted a bigger pay packet? Let him move on and bring someone else who was *supposedly* just as good. It was a business move NOT a footballing move.

true,asuddenpanda,null,null,"You would not necessarily have to go with Christ if you wanted to explore the concept of rebirth in myth alongside the Doctor's ability to regenerate. The phoenix, and its prevalence through many cultures, is just one example of a non-Biblical way to approach the subject. Sure, its a convenient way for them to continue the series without depending on one actor, but what does it say about people that we can't let our heroes die? (For me, it brings to mind how big of a deal Superman's death was, only to have him resurrected again later.) 

There is potentially a lot of DW material if you want to explore the story of Pandora's Box. The given reason Pandora opens the box is curiosity, correct? Consider that in ""The Impossible Planet"" the human group is there essentially out of a desire for knowledge. The Doctor remarks that the group came to the planet ""because it was there."" In Army of Ghosts, there is also the Void ship and energy rift, both of which produce disastrous consequences when Torchwood starts poking and prodding. 

If you don't have it already, I would also recommend picking up The Hero With a Thousand Faces for a reference. It revolves around the premise of how certain themes and hero arcs are universal across all cultures and times. It's even cited as one of the George Lucas's inspirations for Star Wars. :)",0,1335504409,null,0,false,0,c4h5yih,t3_st8jn,t1_c4h5yih,t3_st8jn,null,1428806167,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

He's not kidding. [According to Ofsted](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/guide-registration-early-years-register-childminder) Childminders are defined as: 
""A person who is registered to look after one or more children to whom they are not related on domestic premises for reward.""

The issue is that they don't define 'reward', and a reciprocal arrangement to look after your child has value and could constitute reward. 

As a result you would, technically, be required to register as a Childminder with Offsted. This includes having to have CRB checks for you and anyone over 16 in your house, having to register to follow the EYFS curriculum, having to keep records and reports which also require you to register under the data protection act. 

During Ed Balls turn with the education system did point out that he wouldn't prosecute people, but it is still against the rules, and I'm not aware of any guarantees by the current govt.

In short, being a childminder is a fucking minefield as you basically count as a school, despite the fact you don't need any of this crap to look after your own kids.",0,1335513688,null,0,false,0,c4h75ig,t3_stb3i,t1_c4h75ig,t1_c4gtumi,null,1428806730,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I was going to make the point that even though we can't, it might not be too much to ask for in the 13/14 season. It would of course require a great season in the upcoming one, as well as a good summer with some early signings. We would need both of these. One or the other will not get us in to Europe and succeed.

Defensively we're fine. We have enough people to cover all positions which we've shown through injuries to Jags and lately Baines and with anything it would solve our problem of too many defenders as we could have a European set up and a league one. Let's not forget Shane Duffy is starting to become a prospect as centre half which will come to fruition in a year or two.

But we would certainly struggle going forwards, we need to sign some width (resign Peanuts and look for someone like Donovan but younger). We would have Fellaini supplying Jelavic which is good, but Cahill and Ossie together are hardly gonna strike fear into european defences if they're playing twice a week. Because of this we would need not only 2 wide players but a central playmaker.

Red Dwarf was one of my favourite shows growing up, and even as an ardent fan I'm happy to admit that season 6 and onwards was utter shit, quickly devolving into something worse than utter shit. The Back to Earth specials were especially horrific. It saddens me that for many people, Back to Earth was their first taste of Red Dwarf. It was so bad that it put people off ever exploring the earlier episodes, most of which were fantastic. I forced my girlfriend to watch Red Dwarf sometime last year (she's from New Zealand and so hadn't seen any of it). She liked it, but I stopped at season 6. I didn't want to ruin her enjoyment of the show by seeing what they did to it.

The show was so much better back when there was nothing to do and all the humour came from the conversations and interactions between the characters. As soon as they started having zany adventures in space, the show started to lose what made it so great.

In my opinion, some of the best episodes are the ones where they literally don't go anywhere, like *Marooned* (or really, any episode from the first 3 seasons).

Right, Liverpool have the league cup spot, so that won't go the league, meaning that at maximum the league will only get two Europa spots. If we were to finish 6th and Chelsea 7th, the Europa spot won't go to 6th because it will go to Chelsea through either winning or being runners-up in the FA Cup (as if Liverpool win they already have a Europa spot). If Chelsea win the Champions League, then that spot will revert to 6th place in the league, as they will qualify for next year's CL. However, 4th place also becomes a Europa spot due to the FA only being able to send 4 English teams to the CL. So I don't know what happens to the rest of the Europa places, if they get bumped up or what.

AVB was brought in on the task of preparing the team for the future, adapting the style of play and bringing in youth talent - this obviously caused a rift in the dressing room with some of the senior players not liking the fact that AVB's word was final.

The real problem was that globalisation and weird financial instruments made it hard to appropriately price assets. Companies were taking 9 assets that were worth £100 and mixing in an asset that sort of looked like it might be worth £100. They put these assets into securities and sold the lot as if all the assets were god honest £100 each value. Then companies were taking these apparently £100 assets and further diluting the real value.

The net result of all this was that globally everyone thought they were richer than they really were. Just as soon as their assets hit maturity.

This led to the risk assessments for sub prime to all be way off. Suddenly we could afford 2% interest instead of 4% interest. A 5% deposit rather than a 15% deposit. Then sub prime itself got dragged into this madness of complex financial assets.

There are various solutions to the problem. Firewalling markets will stop bad pricing issues from feeding back into each other. Increasing capital adequacy requirements will force banks to be more conservative anyway.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"I am actually going to go ahead and argue two specific answers, 

1815 and never.  

1815 as it has to be considered at some point during the industrial revolution.  Prior to 1815 there were considerable contemporaries and counter balances in both trade, politics and military.  Following the Battle of Waterloo, the defeat of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna they were all metered away.  The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, France was in turmoil, the golden Spanish period was over, Tsarist Russia was a giant but with limited scope for projecting or mobilising beyond its own borders.  Prussia although a rising power would be concerned with internal pressures and a Germanic confederacy.  Britain effectively stood on its own.

'Never' because it is not a question of losing it to someone - nor did the UK lose the Empire.  Historical, provable fact.  When did the US become a superpower?  It was a mid century term but arguably it had the means to be so by the turn of the 20th century.  US non-interventionism is a myth shortly after Wilson refused to join the League of Nations.  Nazi Germany was built on US science, metal, resources, fuel additives, and most importantly money.  The difference between German and Italian fascism was that Italy by and large planned to be self contained and economically inward.  Germany was built on an integrated and international economy.  The US was certainly an active world player therefore by the 1930s, with Manhattan Project clearly cementing the position.  At that stage Britain was still a superpower in every sense, as was the newly mechanised and organised Soviet Russia.

There's probably no specific event as to when UK superpower status rescinded,  more of a waning; the near bankruptcy of the UK could probably be argued but not convincingly.  If I were to pick a date I'd say the Suez Crisis in 1956, not because of the event, but because it marked the first UN force and the balance of world power had been forever changed.

  The Empire however was not 'lost',   the 1931 Statute of Westminster had been long since in the planning preparing for the transition from Empire to Commonwealth, and willingly drawn up and passed.  The Commonwealth today is thriving.  The lack of colonies does not signify the end of British influence, the loss of colonies was actually of British design to retain and evolve influence.  They'd realised as early as by the 19th century that as countries in the Empire prospered, particularly in Australasia, South Africa and Canada that degrees of autonomy had to be awarded or they would be taken.   Canada, New Zealand and Australia were all in the position to enact the Statute of Westminster in 1939 and not enter the War at the start, to keep out of it much as the US did.  They didn't because of the special Commonwealth ties.",0,1335525199,null,0,true,0,c4h81fp,t3_su4fe,t1_c4h81fp,t3_su4fe,null,1428807148,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That depends what you define as problem. This is a problem in as much as it sucks. Crashes will happen, you can set the financial system to make them less frequent, but growth will be slower, or vice versa. Overall, crashes happen but net growth over say a 20 or 50 or 100 year period is very very good, so one can either accept that crashes are an aspect of a generally very beneficial financial system, or one can reject that and within a few decades we'll be at what would have been crash levels then anyway, just without all the intervening good years.

true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"The banks created overly-complex instruments that they didn't understand, and then spread them all through the financial system. There was insufficient resilience in the system they created, so when these things starting blowing up, the whole thing came crashing down. Only speedy and massive government support stopped it. Many of these governments are now in financial difficulties themselves.

Banking is the industry that failed. Banks are meant to allocate capital to businesses and consumers efficiently; instead, they gave credit to anyone who wanted it. Banks are supposed to make money by managing the risk of transforming short-term debt into long-term loans; instead, it broke them. They are supposed to expedite the flow of credit through economies; instead, they ended up blocking it. 

The idea that financial markets can be left to police themselves turned out to be the world’s most expensive mistake, requiring $15 trillion in capital injections and other forms of support.

At the peak of the madness, the median large bank had borrowings of **37 times** its equity, meaning it could be wiped out by a loss of just 3% of its assets. That's a **median** large bank, not one of the troublemakers.

Products were so complex, and the chains from borrower to end-investor so long, that thorough due diligence was impossible. A proper understanding of a typical [Collateralised Debt Obligation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation) required reading **30,000** pages of documentation. 

Everywhere incentives were misaligned. Large banks were ""too big to fail"". Scrutiny of borrowers was delegated to rating agencies, who were paid by the debt-issuers. Fees for securitisers were paid upfront, increasing the temptation to originate, flog and forget. Banks had the attitude that  ""as long as the music is playing you've got to get up and dance"" (Chuck Prince, Citigroup, 2007). Performance was judged relative to rivals, encouraging banks to copy each other in risk taking, to no long-term benefit.

Banking is an industry that has failed the test of the market-place. It cost the world $15 trillion to learn that lesson. ",0,1335529623,null,0,false,0,c4h8fwi,t3_su4e1,t1_c4h8fwi,t1_c4h6piz,null,1428807339,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In more general terms you could say that our squad lacks robustness. Were missing a couple roles that would give us more flexibility and the ability to counterattack the many teams who will just be playing to neutralize us.

What most fans hope we are looking at falls in 3 positions:

*Center Midfield:* We have a healthy stock of defensive/workhorse midfielders, but were low on creative type midfielders who can dictate the game and are high quality passers. 

*Wingers:* We lack true preferred wingers who can cross well, take players one on one and can burn down the wing with speed to stretch opposing defences. Right now we have Kalou...a great squad player but not much more, Malouda...Way past his prime, offers nothing atm, Mata...wasted on the wings because he is so good in the middle, Sturridge...not a natural winger, much more geared to play as a striker.

*Right Fullback:* Our style of play has always held an important place for fullbacks. Jose Bosingwa has been poor all season and is out of contract this summer. Ivanovic has been great but we still need a backup or perhaps someone who just gives us a different type of fullback.

This seems very unlikely, especially given the video that was just shown. Had they executed him I would imagine the man filming would have been very vocal about just witnessing an execution.

So if anyone can turn it around and start making better more desirable bikes, it's the Dutch.

Our Government and councils have spunked a lot of money on paint, rather than spending money on people that know how to design the infrastructure (experts from Netherlands / Germany etc).  The cost of all that badly designed blue paint in London is shocking.

After all these companies and software companies changing hands for hundreds of millions or even billions, it seems so sad that one of the most well known brand of bikes (even for none cycling people) is only worth £62 million.

Although they sold 850,000 bikes so there's still hopes yet, I guess the higher the price of petrol goes, the more people will start cycling.

We've yet to have the discrepancy clearly explained.  Stafford Scott, one of the 2 IPCC reference group members who resigned is one of those who talks about the location of the gun, he reports: ""We were told that at least three officers had given a statement that they had witnessed another officer, a sergeant, throwing away the gun that was later found several feet from Duggan's body. When we sought to identify the officers involved, we were told there was no evidence to support the allegation – that this statement was in fact never given. Yet we were informed by the commissioner that it had been.""  So, as I say, the picture is still clouded in secrecy, confusing and has many different conflicting accounts.

You may need to understand more about the classic show, which is where RTD and Moffat draw much inspiration as longtime fans, and the way the addition of both new Doctors and producers affect the content of the show.

Doctors have been introverted, egotistical, manipulative and romantic. The companions have been his family, his coworkers, strangers, survivors, robots, aliens, historical figures. Each Doctor and the choice of companions he travels with have been influenced by changes in producer. The next producer rarely has his eye on the last guy's toys; rare exceptions are for characters that have been absent for a while and are remembered fondly by fans over the years.

We can't say the characters you miss will never reappear in the show, but they all had their storylines wrapped up rather neatly by RTD.

Hello All,

As many of you know, i'm having to close down my Etsy store soon so i'm giving away much of my leftover Doctor Who decals. There are quite a lot of them so i'll be giving away a small few every week or 2.

**Today's Giveaways are;**

* 1. 10th Doctor Decal
* 2. 10th Doctor Decal
* 3. [TARDIS (blue)](http://www.etsy.com/listing/97815087/blue-box-decal-on-sale)

I'd link to the items on my store page but they've been taken down. There are about a dozen designs left on my store, feel free to check them out on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop/colincapurso).

I'll be following a similar format to my other giveaways. All you need to do is leave a comment here. I'll leave entries open for 24 hours. After that no entries will be accepted.

Postage is free and includes international.

(How it works behind the scenes: All commenter names are collected and then put into some software that spits people at random)

Leaving a comment enters you into the competition to win a decal

true,TheMightyShrub,null,[Surrey Scally],"As a southener who moved to Liverpool, I make that journey regularly. It really depends on how far in advance you can book. 

If you don't mind changing trains at Crewe/Birmingham/Chester you can get the train and it'll probably cost you less than £20.

The pendolino train (direct Virgin service from Euston to Lime Street) is definitely the fastest option. You can get it for less than £20 if you book a couple of months in advance, but if you need to book closer to the time, you're looking at £50-£70.

Don't take a taxi. It's halfway across the country. Even if you could find a taxi driver who would take it, it would cost HUNDREDS of pounds.

The cheapest way is to take the National Express coach. It leaves from London Victoria, and I think there's a connecting service from Heathrow. You can get tickets for about £10, but beware - they take AGES. Depending on traffic, somewhere between 5 and 7 hours.

So in summary - if you're booking about 2 months in advance, take th direct virgin service. If it's under 2 months in advance, but you don't want the journey to take forever, get the London-Midland train service. If you want to save cash and don't mind a long journey, take the National Express Coach.

If you want any more advice, feel free to PM me. I've literally done the journey over 100 times, by pretty much every kind of transport available.

It's not a clever ruse like how other Doctors would play up their daftness when they aren't nearly as foolish as they seem (*nobody's* a stupid as he seems). 

Eleven mistakes promises of good football matches for death threats. He doesn't recognize a pregnant woman right in front of him as being pregnant. He spoke to Rory for forty seconds, addressing him *as Rory* without registering that Rory was alive. 

This Doctor's not just oddball... he's a bit daft. I chalk it up to dementia.

And if anyone's a caricature, it's Eleven. He doesn't even pretend to be a rounded living person. He's just a character, and that's what Moffat's going for.

Of course, being inefficient is not the same as profiteering. But the energy retailer can profiteer by being ""inefficient"", provided you pass your profits on to another company. In this case it is the ""upstream"" parent firms that produce the oil/gas; simply pay them over the odds for the oil/gas. In this case ""wastefulness"" = passing on the honey to another company. This is the accusation, but OFGEM has no power to investigate their books.

Note how the big energy firms split into ""upstream"" and retail companies after privatisation.

If this is indeed the case, then there may be even more than £4bn+ in profiteering.

[spoiler](/s ""Dorium Maldovar: And Doctor Song? In prison all her days?"")

[spoiler](/s ""The Doctor: Her days, yes. Her nights... well, that's between her and me, eh?"") 

I took this as showing the plot arc over the course of Season Six, where from the Doctor's perspective he both learns to trust River and begins a romantic/sexual relationship with her. 

He met her in *Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead*, adventured with her but didn't really know her for *The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone* and *The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang*, and at the start of *The Impossible Astronaut* he specifically says he ""loves a bad girl"" but doesn't really know her and doesn't trust her.

Then in defeating the Silence he starts to trust her, leading to the start of their relationship at the end of *Day of the Moon.* Over Season 6 he gets to know who she really is.

And from River's POV, their romantic/sexual relationship begins with the events in *The Wedding of River Song* and her imprisonment, and ends with *Day of the Moon* when she realizes the Doctor doesn't remember that aspect of their relationship.

Where Amy was shallow, self-centered, and irresponsible Rory was selfless, kind, and thoughtful.

Did you notice in A Good Man Goes to War how he learned the Sontaran's name? How he knew about the Twelfth Cyberlegion and in general has done his homework about space-stuff since The Eleventh hour?

Rory puts up with Amy (which in itself makes him a *saint*) and continues to care about the individuals he meets.

Where Amy says ""everyone else can die first"" Rory learns about them and cares about their ""little victories"".

He's actually useful to the team with not just his medical expertise, but his impeccable natural empathy.

I admire him not because he's fearless (which Amy behaves as), but because he *is* afraid, but carries on anyway. He understands that he could die at any moment, but continues on because he loves Amy.

Rory is an *incredibly* interesting and engaging character, *particularly* in comparison to Amy and it's a travesty that throughout his tenure he's been little more than a satellite character for Amy, with virtually all of his dialogue revolving around her and spending every episode either bending to her will or trying to save her.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"No, having life and character (particularly in Doctor Who) is about saying brilliant and hilarious things left right and center and not even taking a breath to retread old ground.

Doctor Who's all about discovering the new and doing brand-new things. Fashion means nothing to him because he's a time traveler. The period when bow ties were cool and the period where bowties aren't cool and the point where bowties don't even exist are all just locations to him. Places he could flit off to in the blink of an eye if he cared. So why is the Doctor all about defending the tie? Particularly in that *exact same way every time?*

And it is on Moffat. Moffat's big on the repetitions and driving once-hilarious gags into the ground and then digging down for rock bottom.

You remember timey wimey wibbly wobbly? How hilarious it was in Ten's speech in Blink? 

How the whole joke was that the sentence ""got away from him"", and how it sounded silly without actually explaining anything?

Yeah, that was great. And then Moffat brought it back in Time Crash. Odd, a bit out of place (don't know why he's expecting Five to know the phrase), but not too terribly bad.

Now we've got ""spacey-wacey"" and ""sciency-wiency"" or worse... ***""humany-woomany""***.

People on our radar are generally players who are near the end of their contract so their transfer fee is not extremely high, players who have stated that they are interested in playing for Chelsea, players whose position we need or want, and other things like players who have said they want to play in England and play a position we need.

* 
**Higuain** is rumored because he has not been featuring as much as he would like in the new Real Madrid side and Chelsea's strikers have not performing up to the level they would like, and he happens to be a striker who is still young and has proven that he can score goals. 

* 
**Hazard** is another transfer target for Chelsea because we obviously need a winger and he has made it pretty clear that he wants to play in England next season and plans on leaving Lille in the summer. He has also mentioned that he likes Chelsea (not exclusively--he also said he likes Manchester United among other teams). 

* 
**Kagawa**, a CAM/AMF, is rumored because he has stated that he is not renewing his contract with Dortmund and wants to either play for Chelsea or Manchester United next season (exclusively).

* 
**Willian** is another winger who is rumored because AVB/Chelsea had contacted Shaktar about him and he (Willian) has said that he would love to play for Chelsea.

All of those players besides Higuain have talked about Chelsea and are open to moving there (maybe not as their first option), so that is the main reason they are at the top of the list. Most other players are just rumored because people feel that they would leave their current club to play for Chelsea, and occupy a position we need.

true,thebuggalo,null,null,"You're definitely not alone. My feeling is that the show feels a bit more dumbed down since Moffat took over. It seems like it's written for a much younger audience than the RTD era. They both have their cheesy episodes and both have their darker episodes, but with Matt Smith playing dress-up in every other episode, and all the over-the-top acting of River Song, it often felt more like a Disney show than a 50 year old Sci Fi show. I know RTD had very childish episodes and situations, but something about the way they were handled didn't feel childish to me, it felt more campy, which I think fits with the history of Doctor Who more.

I think Moffat is great at using time to tell complex and weaving stories, but isn't that good at handling season long developments.  The characters in Season 5 and 6 don't seem to grow or change.  Moffat is very much about plot and story and not about characters, whereas RTD was very good at portraying very realistic characters that you could believe and feel for. They grew as people based on their experiences with the Doctor, and the Doctor grew based on his interactions with the people he saved and his companions.  It's very much a personal preference thing.  Some people prefer the deeper plots (and ignore the holes/flaws associated with them), some would rather have very dramatic situations with a heroic Doctor, and some just want goofy play-time, fairytale stories with the Doctor. None of those are wrong, and both Moffat and RTD are guilty of all, it's just what you prefer.

I felt like Season 5 was the weakest of the New Who so far, which probably dampened my reaction to Season 6, but I went into Season 6 expecting to not me impressed and came out respecting Matt Smith's portrail of the Doctor.  Though I ended up disliking River Song very very much.  I feel like her character is just way too out of place and loud.  I didn't like her sexual innuendo's and over-acting.

To me, it seems like the demographic of Doctor Who went from all-ages, to 13-16 year old girls with the switch to Moffat. I still enjoy the show, but not as much as I did when RTD was behind the wheel. I don't think anyone can tell you if you are a true Whovian or not.

If you think about the people speak in general we tend to gravitate toward the phrases all the time. While phrases like wibbly wobbly and spacy wacey and so forth aren't literary masterpieces they do make him more relatable which is important when your main character is an alien. And, a really really really old alien at that. To me they add charm which I like. What I don't like is how many episodes with this doctor take place on a relatively modern earth. Tennet was on space stations and numerous other planets that added this great variety and atmosphere that I currently feel is missing. It's like they expect us to believe he is the defender of the universe when he is off camera and defender of earth and humanity while on camera. I will say though that when Matt is in serious mode I find him much more frightening than I did David. He can pull out this very very dark doctor. I think that may be why when he is in lighthearted mode they give him lines such that he is almost sickeningly sweet to draw that huge comparison between who he wants to be and who he has to be.

The police have to take some responsibility for the riots, given that their general treatment of black people was what led to this one incident ""breaking the camels back"". 

They do. But again, I honestly don't think that they thought killing an armed drug dealer on his way to kill someone would be the straw.

&gt; In the USA the ""three strike system"" has been blamed for criminals trying to get away at all costs. They already face life in jail so what's a few extra people shot, right? We risk the same problem here except that death is what faces the gangsters. They'd stop at nothing to get away alive and that's a very dangerous scenario. We are supposed to be reducing gun crime, not encouraging it. 

There was absolutely nothing novel about this incident or the way the armed police engaged Duggan. They thought he had a gun (based on intelligence from earlier in the day), so they stopped him and ordered him to surrender at gun point, which is the same response you would get if this took place in Surrey or Berkshire rather than Tottenham and you happened to be a notable philanthropist. I'm not really sure how your proposing this is changed to appease gang members in London, if someone is thought to be armed you cannot treat them as anything other than armed until they have surrendered and been found to be unarmed. If they don't comply, don't surrender or make what are considered to be hostile movements (which includes something as simple as pulling your pants up) then it is far more likely that they will be shot, and since the police aim for the center of mass (because they are less likely to miss) then this is likely to be fatal. In all honesty, no matter what you think of the police, or if your are 100% innocent of whatever it is they think you have done, if the police are pointing firearms at you then you should do exactly as they say and nothing else. At least you will be alive to complain about it.  

The only really sensible improvements to this would be shotguns with beanbag rounds, or tasers, as this would incapacitate the target rather than killing them. However, there is a problem with gang members wearing bullet proof vests, in some cases openly, and tasers are considered to be reprehensible by many of the same people who think Duggan shouldn't have been shot.

But again, don't take my comments as saying I didn't like Ten.  I think I called into work for a day of mourning after the regeneration lol.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; don't think that they thought...would be the straw

Absolutely. On the other hand there was good reason for them to believe that a ""hands off"" response would be good tactic, at least on the first night or so. I'm sure I read somewhere that it was a calculated move, based on the idea that if people are protesting excessive force by the police (valid or not) then being heavy handed is not a good move. It may well be that no response from them could have prevented it. 

&gt; I'm not really sure how your proposing this is changed to appease gang members in London

You misunderstand, I'm a pragmatist. If the MET develop a reputation for ""shooting first"" then it will only increase the demand for illegal firearms for the criminals. It's a ""nothing to lose"" scenario for them. 

A simpler approach would be an automatic life sentence for being in possession of an illegal firearm. Make this clear that just touching one counts and prosecute it every single time.

&gt; tasers are considered to be reprehensible by many

I don't doubt most UK police could use tasers responsibly but if I were a black man in london I'd be in a completely different situation.

Tasers are a great tool when used in a situation where a firearm would normally be discharged. The problem is that they become ""compliance devices"" used by cops who have prejudices against those they are pointing them at. We've had numerous high-profile proofs of contiuned racism from the MET and people have every right to be concerned about the increasing arsenal they are getting.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Absolutely. On the other hand there was good reason for them to believe that a ""hands off"" response would be good tactic, at least on the first night or so. I'm sure I read somewhere that it was a calculated move, based on the idea that if people are protesting excessive force by the police (valid or not) then being heavy handed is not a good move. It may well be that no response from them could have prevented it. 

TBH there really isn't much they could do. If they take a hands off approach they get crap for letting gang violence, shootings, stabbings etc become a huge problem, or for riots developing in this case. And if they go in hard then they get attacked for unjustified stop and searches, apparent racism or being heavy handed. So while I do think there are substantial problems with the Met, I am prepared to give them some leeway the bad things that happen because I do believe that overall the Met is trying to do what it's supposed to do which is prevent/fight crime.

&gt; You misunderstand, I'm a pragmatist. If the MET develop a reputation for ""shooting first"" then it will only increase the demand for illegal firearms for the criminals. It's a ""nothing to lose"" scenario for them.
&gt;
&gt; A simpler approach would be an automatic life sentence for being in possession of an illegal firearm. Make this clear that just touching one counts and prosecute it every single time.

I'm not a fan of automatic sentences myself, especially if they are life sentences. You do get cases where very young children are used as mules or where women in relationships where Stockholm syndrome is the only reason they are together keep weapons. This is an issue you have to tackle at both ends, you need to do a lot more to break up gang culture before people pick up weapons, especially when it comes to intervening with problem children at an early age or banning gang members from London, or from even being in the same room as other members of the gang. It might be considered heavy handed or illiberal but London has a serious problem with gangs (for the UK at least) and the remedy needs to be equally serious. 

When it comes to gang members engaging in gun battles with the police, this is something where there should be no half measures upon. They should be engaged with lethal force and killed, and people should know about it. So combined with the above you have an approach where there is intervention early in peoples lives, dealing with the lack of father figures (which is an issue to a lot of London's black poor children) serious socio-economic reform and urban regeneration, a focus on education, some changes made to drugs legislation and other efforts, all designed to make living a normal life with a job, family and playing football at the weekends both desirable and achievable, combined with it being known that the police do shoot to kill, that they will do this if pushed and that if you try and fight them then not only will you be killed, your family will be in very serious trouble. We need a fully end to end approach to dealing with the socio-economic problems that cause criminality, rather than flip flopping between right wing or left wing approaches. 

There also needs to be more done with the immigration policy, especially when it comes to naturalization. There are a lot of people in London who come from cultures where violence is more acceptable, or where disputes which would typically be solved with an angry letter involve physical violence. Combined with deprivation it is a recipe for disaster. 

&gt; I don't doubt most UK police could use tasers responsibly but if I were a black man in london I'd be in a completely different situation.
&gt;
&gt; Tasers are a great tool when used in a situation where a firearm would normally be discharged. The problem is that they become ""compliance devices"" used by cops who have prejudices against those they are pointing them at. We've had numerous high-profile proofs of contiuned racism from the MET and people have every right to be concerned about the increasing arsenal they are getting. 

Tasers are used as a compliance device without actually having someone be shocked. Quite often the police have found that simply pulling out a Taser and discharging it into nothing will result in someone who is being violent, resisting arrest or simply being a dick suddenly start behaving themselves. And I don't really have a huge problem with this. Where I do draw the line is where a Taser is used for pain compliance, or to punish someone. So yes, we do need to ensure that there is an auditing trail for all Taser activations, while allowing the police the freedom to be able to use the tools they have appropriately. 

I do really like the idea of having all cops wear head cameras though. Not only would it do more to prevent abuses of power by police officers, but it would also protect police officers from false accusations of abuse.
