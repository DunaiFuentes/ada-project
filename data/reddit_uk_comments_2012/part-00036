Man Utd and Chelsea have been searching for this kind of player for *years*.  It is so difficult to put a value on him because he is of such a rare breed and so highly in demand.

Adebayor has been fantastic, but he is not of the same calibre.  His movement and reading of the game is brilliant, but when you play one striker you really need to see 20 goals from them.  He is a great signing, but not irreplaceable like Modric.

There is also the presumption that debt costs will remain stable. Remember that TfL debt will rise over the next four years, even with fare rises. It also got an outlook negative rating from Fitch which could lead to higher debt management fees.

Finally, Ken denies that slicing that amount of money out of the budget will reduce the funding for vital investment work - but honestly, no one really believes that is possible.

He was a bit of a twat when it was all happening, but once it was over he focused up and didn't cause any problems at all. He has a great attitude.

I can just put myself in his position and understand where he's coming from. He is comfortably one of the best at his position in the world and he deserves to be competing for silverware. This season has been great, but our results against the best in the division show we are not there yet. 

Only 3 options IMO:

1) Improve the squad to a degree that shows we want to push on and cement a place in the top four. 

2) Sell Luka and use the money towards #1.

3) Hold Luka, potentially against his will, and continue to buy the odd player on a free or 33 year old for cheap.


I just think we're going to see some spending this summer. When Arsenal are gearing up to spend, that's a huge sign of the times.

At that point I (correctly, I believe) had Nirpal down as a member of the race-relations circle jerk. People appointing themselves leader of a community, a spokesperson or just a commentator on the nebulous concept of race in order to highlight/exploit division in order to extract money from government, local councils, the media or private enterprise for lending their ""expertise"" and using ""unique relationship, understanding and perspective"". A great way to get ahead in this racket is to tear down or declare as irrelevant rival speakers and organisations and generally kick up a storm.

As long as Critical Race Theory is the dominant ethos when discussing race, there will always be those who can make a buck out of this industry. Whatever equality or gains are achieved or exist anyway are irrelevant because there will always be money in declaring yourself ""the voice"" of a particular ""community of an ethnic group or colour, and your power lies in making sure that the people you ""represent"" think that their lives are harder *because* of their skin colour/ethnicity and that you work in their interests. It's great work if you can get it.

O2 should have followed the lead of BT. Last time they were asked by ACS:Law for information, shortly before it shut down, they simply said they didn't have it.

I still talk to people normally who are nice to me, all my calls are recorded but it is unlikely any one will get listened to.
Some of the really arsey callers think I am taking the piss when I agree with them.

I was actually naïve enough to think I would be helping people when I got the job.
People need to understand that call centers are not there to help people. They are there to put up a wall of lower middle class people with a computer system that gives them NO power to really help people.
So that we are basically arguing amongst ourselves whilst those responsible are off in their second or third homes, somewhere really nice.
People hate our service but they always find a way to make a nice little spreadsheet that says that things are great.
I REALLY need to find a new job.

But you are right, I need to chill out, I will make myself ill, I think I have a little bit already.
I appreciate what you say loudribs, getting angry will not make things better.
Sorry for going on, I just needed to get out one of the main reasons why I feel so angry.
It’s nice to know that people who don’t want to change the world still have compassion.
I will start meditating again and making time to chill out.",0,1333126715,null,0,false,0,c46ovbn,t3_rfq0n,t1_c46ovbn,t1_c45za8y,null,1428624495,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Summary- pointless figure on its own (yes, if you are only reading half sentances) Whilst uk has largest total debt in world we also have largest overseas balance sheet. I quite clearly said this so not to be misconstrued as projecting a doom and gloom scenario.

Total debt is not a classical economic indicator, never insinuated for a second that it was. It's an interesting ratio however. Its not the type of data which would say have an effect on my short term decision making process but it interesting nonetheless when viewed in comparison to other nations. I'm astounded (and impressed) that you have (literally) 23 economic textbooks on your coffee table. It is a simple addition of the combined debt levels of the UKs personal, corporate and public debt levels viewed in comparison to GDP and that of other nations.

it's interesting primarily because it isn't a classical economic indicator. The interesting bit is not delving into the micro side of things and asking why use GDP as a measure, it is when looking at us in comparison to the rest of the world. There is a huge disparity. If you don't feel that is useful then good for you. 

Apart from focusing upon this non classical 'total' debt issue, I'm not sure what point you are trying to raise.

My underlying point is that when you look at the difference across nations, the bulk of uk total debt being corporate and the concept of rehypothication which is centred in the UK, things are not that rosy

Regardless, it is 6pm Friday. The market is dead. I'm happy to concede completely on this issue as I do not have the will to continue in my free time tbh.

All the best sir, have a nice weekend

From his (quite short) review of the Milan - Barcelona game

&gt;From the start, it must be said that both teams used their usual systems. AC Milan with a classic 1-4-3-1-2 and FC Barcelona with their usual 1-4-3-3. At first, the Rossoneri pressed the Catalans high with the option that, if they could not regain the ball, they had to drop off quickly to help the defence.

&gt;With the number of men in the middle, they hindered the ball circulation of Barcelona and, as Andres Iniesta came inside, they had no width on that side. On the right, as always, Dani Alves gives width and allows Alexis to move inside and behind the defence.

&gt;Milan created a good chance for Robinho who has mobility in attack. It was at the start of the game and before another clear Ibrahimovic chance who was faced with Valdes to prevent him scoring. There was not much more. Their game is based on looking for the space created behind Dani Alves or finding Ibrahimovic to challenge with Mascherano to win the first ball. And from there try to win the second ball. Barcelona, who had more possession and control, lacked the inspiration of Messi, heavily guarded by the Milan players. Also Abiatti made sure they did not get an away goal in a Champions League match for the first time in thirty games. And this was despite their 17 shots on goal.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I actually think housebuilding is one of the most important, underdiscussed topics in British politics. The average house price in Britain is [£230,000](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/uk_house_prices/html/houses.stm), and the average wage £30 odd thousand. We spend our lifetimes putting together enough money to have somewhere to live, and the prices carry on going up even as wages stagnate, and building costs go down. The reason for this is to one degree or another artificial. Clearly we live in a densely populated country, but there is also plenty of space, especially if we build high-density, well-designed, well-planned housing. Yet building rates have dwindled to half what they were in the 60s.

The increases in house prices act as an enormous transfer of wealth, from people who don't own houses to those that do, meaning the young to the middle-aged and elderly, and the poor to the wealthy. And we have got to the stage where so many people are advantaged by high house prices that they vote for policies which further restrict building and increase artificial scarcity, to increase the value of their assets. The result of all this is that huge sections of the population cannot afford to live independently, so that they rely on family or friends or else become homeless; and even if they can afford, perhaps only on the basis that they move away from their jobs, or the same friends and family. 

The whole situation is idiotic, and genuinely destructive of the fabric of our society.

Looking at the sleeves, you can tell that the material slightly resembles that of a swimsuit. It seems like it's made out of a very stretchy material. [This image](http://famouscfc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/new-shirt-2.jpg) will help support this argument (image is the full version of the one posted by kokocostanza). Look at the bottom of the jersey, where it reaches below the dummy it's on. It just warps around it. I'm no expert, but I believe a skintight outfit might actually get in the way of/slow down a player's movement. 

It also seems just a little too long for a normal human torso. The silver tag on the left side (our right) indicates that the shirt is meant to be worn on the outside, and not tucked in, but if that's the case, the might as well not even wear shorts as the shirt will most probably reach below their hips. 

Also, the Chelsea logo is not embroidered. Rather, it seems to me like it's a pressed plastic. You can tell this by looking at the glare: the silver lines outlining the blue circle are thicker (in height) than the blue. The same seems to apply to the lion. Also, the glare on the silver is too metallic to be made of thread.

I agree that they might have pushed at Labour and their Unite link, but was there really a huge backlash at the budget that required us to divert our attention? Seems like standard, traditional, everyday political point scoring.

The pasties talk was a low point for politics with no real story other than a class discussion, and the granny 'tax' was in no way worse for them than other issues this government has faced such as the NHS and universities baring in mind that there were other concessions in the budget as well.

Making petrol strikes an issue was just as likely to bite them in the ass as these previous stories since the government would have to step in and be responsible. They had to say something about potential fuel strikes, as they were being asked about them. This wasn't an attempt to divert attention away from other relatively small issues.

In addition I think he recognizes how important his role was to so many people and he's warmed up considerably to the people at the BBC (he's doing a mini-series about the Borrowers right now) and he admires Moffat quite a bit, so I think (and very much hope) that when push comes to shove he'll be willing to come back around.

Paul McGann (Eight) also says that [he'd love to come back for something, but he's not been ringed up for anything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDOMy98R9hk). And I'd *love* to see him brought back, and if they're doing the Time War (which feels rather likely) it seems probable.

Tennant's a lock. He's *the Doctor*. He's the image that when people under fourty close their eyes and say ""the Doctor"", he's the one that springs to mind. He's *owned the role*.

I was a Special in the Met until very recently. Everyone I worked with was fantastic. Very professional when dealing with the massive amounts of shit thrown at them every day. Now don't get me wrong, I know there are bad coppers. Everyone I worked with didn't want hassle.

As for institutional racism, the Macphereson (sp?) Report is taken very seriously by the Met. They constantly bring in new directives for fairness and equality and unfortunately a lot of the time they overlook what really matters (chasing criminals). The Met is bloated with civilian staff and true reform would bring policing back to it's roots, visible police presence in problem areas instead of hand-wringing about whether a minority group has enough police liaisons. 

I apologise for my small rant. I had a great time in the Met and really felt like I could've made a difference, but for senior officers worried about figures.

The only companies that have access to land just build hideous housing and infrastructure with almost no design consideration beyond maximising units whilst limiting unit size. They tend to suffer from damp and condensation too because they use steel lintels, plastic windows, facades and other impermeable materials, which is all about de-skilling workers, quickening and lowering build times/costs, but only then to make maintenance more expensive and difficult in the long run. It could be possible for every house (or neighbourhood) to have on site water catchment and even sewage disposal is feasible, perhaps energy production through wind, solar, passive solar or subterranean heat exchangers. If you are lucky you will get freehold, if not, you'll have the privilege of paying a service charge to some rent seeker for the probable mismanagement of your disaster fund.

All we get is the meandering faux suburban bullshit that is mostly tarmac for cars and pokey gardens. That's of course if they aren't all flats. They can't even design houses that take advantage of the natural sun direction which would ease the soon to be arriving energy crisis: it's a damn fine idea to have all your windows north facing. It would also be prudent to re-introduce coppicing and small scale farming, so for a given area all the major needs are met: food, fuel and water. But no, let's throw up the next generation's ghettos, supply them with a tescos which can only create shit jobs no one really wants, that literally produce nothing for the local economy and sucks money out back to London or some other tax haven, and wonder why food prices and petrol sky-rocket if the markets as much as sneeze.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I would, as I postulated, an episode that underscored isolationism and being alone and defenseless.

The look of the Silents, the suits, the tall slenderness, seems to strike best on Earth and in an Earth environment, most Slenderman works take place in abandon buildings but something more personal, like a home, could be even more frightening.

But to the point. This need not be a Doctor-lite episode, but it should be an episode where the Doctor is vulnerable. No sonic. No TARDIS. No escape. He should also have his companion and then be separated from them during the course.

The Silents should also be shown as willing to kill. And I don't mean disintegrating random strangers. I mean killing a character you didn't expect to die, a character that would have played a larger role.

The picture in my head is that of a little boy, huddled in the corner of a dark living room, crouching behind the sofa and clutching his mouth so not to scream as he hears the sound of a man saying ""You're not getting through here, so you're going to just have to ki--"" before being silenced with a bang and a flash. Silence rings as the Silence enters the next room. The room with the child.

That's the suspense the Silents need. I don't see fight chords or having a Silent pop out at you. I see a slow suspense. That of realizing the call is coming from inside the house.

With Slenderman less is more and that's how it should be with the Silents. Their presence should be felt throughout the episode, even when they aren't there. Every pregnant pause should leave the viewer wondering ""is there one in the room with them right now?"" and ""where is it?""

That's the real scare with the Silents. They could be anywhere. In the house, in the same room, right behind you.

I suppose I'd have to really meditate on the creatures to come up with anything really concrete, but those should be the main goals.

At this stage it seems more likely and more warranted for the Doctor to go through a heavy episode about how the Silents are not so different than the Time Lords and have him question whether tricking humanity into murder is really such a good idea.

However I feel that it is equally important to establish these brilliantly frightening villains as a true menace. I want to see the Doctor brought *to his knees* by these things. I want the Doctor to desperately wish to run, but have no power to do so. I want to see the Doctor alone and scared for the first time in a very, very long time.

The Silents are much like the weeping Angels. They're a far more intimidating foe in silence than in speech, and are purely frightening just in figure. I want to see them used as a horror monster, not as some new political army for the Doctor to combat.

When you bring it to combat it becomes foe vs. ally, when it really should be predator vs. prey.

Mickey went to the alternate universe but when they broke through to come back to help Mickey chose to stay because his grandmother (the primary reason he went to the alternate universe in the first place) had died and he'd said his goodbyes to her.

true,insidiousthought,tennant,Tennant,"As to your second reason, they don't film episodes of them traveling to other species planets(though they do allude to them by comment) and the adventures therein.

Unfortunately the theory is wrong but possibly just not turned on the right head.  The doctor makes a comment in ""A Good Man Goes to War"" [Spoilers](/s ""that the time lords came about after traveling through the Time Vortex or TV for billions of years, and River Song became part of one after conception in the TV.  This leads us to believe that the TV causes lifeforms to become quantum when their waveform collapses, so technically any Species could become or conceive of a Time Lord.  Just my pet theory on it."")

Further unlikely because killing the predecessors to the Time-Lords would violate Fixed-Point time issues due to the time-interactions of the time lords through time preceding the Time Lock.

And even knowing they want to stop the Doctor, we have little reason as to *why*. Yes, it's to prevent the question from being asked, but why are they doing it *this way?* Why are they not simply destroying Trenzalore or cutting out the Doctor's larynx?

Canton did no coaxing whatsoever. The Silent just said it totally unprovoked, making it less ""Oh, isn't the Doctor clever"" into ""Oh, aren't the Silents kind of stupid"".

He doesn't have a face at all.  It's a blank oval.  The Silents have very distinctive features. And stealing children wasn't really the silents' thing.  They stole one child.  Once. They're thing was controlling society through manipulation and secrecy and trying to destroy The Doctor.  I think it's was just a coincidence that Slenderman steals children and the Silence's plan involved kidnapping one.  Also the Silent are never seen behind someone out of focus.  They're only seen when a character sees them.  It's done the same way as the Angels in Blink where they only move when the camera isn't on them. When the character forgets about them, they stop existing for the camera.

I think that both the Silents and Slenderman were inspired by the same idea of the faceless man in the suit as a powerful, unstoppable, inhuman evil that our society has created as a default ""unstoppable semihuman"") through the idea of G-Men and evil corporate CEOs sitting in shadowy rooms.  The Silents were supposed to be reminiscent of the 50s/60s UFO conspiracy setting they were first seen in.  Hence the Greys and MIB.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

After that, we can safely assume they talked quite a bit, and they honestly have a lot of common ground. They both were rejected by someone they loved because of the Doctor/Rose relationship, but both used that to become emotionally stronger. They also both underwent transformations after leaving the TARDIS because of their experiences there, going from observers to participants. Both became much stronger and more self-confident. It makes sense that each would seek out a partner that could understand where they are mentally and emotionally and also how they got to that place.

* Terraced houses, which are rows of (usually three or more) houses attached to each other along the entire street. These houses are often quite small, and a lot were actually built during the industrial revolution to house all the workers.

* Semi-detached houses, which are two houses attached to each other, so you are only sharing one common wall. These are generally larger than terraced houses.

* Detached houses, which are not attached to any other houses (hence the name!), and are generally larger than other houses, but of course not always.

* Bungalows: these are detached houses, but are single-storey or maisonette.

So by your post description, it seems like you'd be looking for a four bedroom detached house, which you are most likely to find in the ""suburbs"". Generally speaking, in town you'll find apartments and terraced houses, and semi-detached and detached houses are more likely to be in the ""suburbs"". (""Suburbs"" in quotes, because I think that our suburbs here in the UK are probably more urban than a lot of those in the US due to the lack of space to build in the country.)

If this is the case, then it's generally true that public transport won't be as frequent or as easy to access as it would be in the town centre, so you'll probably need to get a car to drive to your office, or find a bus route. Although I'm not at all familiar with Reading, so only take my advice as a generalisation!

Edit: As for driving, the DVLA handles driving licences, and a quick look at their website seems to imply that you'll be okay to drive here for 12 months on your US licence, having to get a UK licence by passing a test before the 12 months is up if you wish to continue to drive.

 Pretty much all of them are traditional bricks/blocks and mortar exteriors and either the same inside for older builds and timber frame/plaster board for new ones.  Yet in the US for example most houses appear to be timber framed and clad with very little structural brick work.  The difference in construction time must be pretty large, it's a lot quicker to throw up wooden framing for a house (especially when it arrives as a kit on the back of a flat bed truck) and then clad it in non-structural stone or as our US cousins seem to prefer siding, than to build the shell out of bricks or blocks. 

It appears to be good enough form of construction for an awful lot of americans to live in, but over here getting a mortgage for 'non-traditional' construction can be a problem.

I didn't lay into your source, or you for that matter, I was just inquiring where you heard such information because, well, you didn't say and it is a fairly big thing to do around here. Especially when making such a large statement.

Perhaps I could suggest you word your title differently next time? 'Post on Reliable Liverpool forum suggests Adam could miss the rest of the season' or similar. And then perhaps a link to the page itself.

Also, you complain about the down-voting. Not only is this post currently on 20 more upvotes than downvotes but I feel you have little to complain about. I was not one to downvote you you so I cannot really comment, but I'm pretty sure it was to do with calling people 'stupid' and the attitude you adopted.

&gt;14 January 1989: A copy of the book burned in Bradford. Extensive media coverage and debate. Some support from non-Muslims.

.

&gt;12 February 1989: Six people are killed and 100 injured when 10,000 attack the American Cultural Center in Islamabad, Pakistan protesting against Rushdie and his book.

.

&gt;13 February 1989: One person is killed and over 100 injured in anti-Rushdie riots in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.

.

&gt;27 May 1989: **15,000 to 20,000** Muslims gather in Parliament Square in London burning Rushdie in effigy and calling for the novel's banning.


Are they all extremists and fanatics within a more gentle religion or are they the real face of Islam?

Agree that no one gets it right all the time and especially with your point about dictators. 

If you've not read this before then it's worth perusing.

&gt;his is all overshadowed by the unarguable hash that was made of the intervention itself. But I would nonetheless maintain that this incompetence doesn't condemn the enterprise wholesale. A much-wanted war criminal was put on public trial. The Kurdish and Shiite majority was rescued from the ever-present threat of a renewed genocide. A huge, hideous military and party apparatus, directed at internal repression and external aggression was (perhaps overhastily) dismantled...

&gt;None of these positive developments took place without a good deal of bungling and cruelty and unintended consequences of their own. I don't know of a satisfactory way of evaluating one against the other any more than I quite know how to balance the disgrace of Abu Ghraib, say, against the digging up of Saddam's immense network of mass graves.

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2008/03/how_did_i_get_iraq_wrong_11.2.html

Worth noting how Galloway went about the Bradford West campaign, as noted here

&gt;The former Labour MP, expelled from the party in 2003 over the Iraq war, fought a campaign that homed in on the Asian vote, and with the electoral wards of City, Manningham and Toller making up much of the constituency – along with Labour not seeing the man from Respect coming, with his stoking of resentment against recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – he prevailed.

http://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/say-goodbye-dan.html

Also goes into a few other reasons for his 'surprise' (think the only surprise is that his victory is considered one).

Do have some issue with your last comment. Doesn't it depend on how voraciously one seeks power, the methods used, etcetera? Some people are just altruistic or plain decent (not suggesting without flaw however) and not in it for a Blair-trip.

Lastly, going back to Galloway, was nice to see his appreciation for the people of Bradford who voted for him XD

The whole affair was engineered as an attack on the Unions.

The drivers have very specific and legitimate issues.

*I’ve been doing this job for 18 years, and in that time I can only say things have never been worse. It is shocking to look back on how this business was once run and compare it with what happens today. Direct employment has ended, and standards have been stretched all the way down the supply chain. They’re at breaking point now.

The costs are still fixed – tankers, equipment, hoses – it is just that there are more businesses in the chain, all looking for their slice of the profit. And they come looking for it by cutting training, always pushing us to do more for less. We’re at that point now where we have to take a stand or see this industry deteriorate beyond repair. 

That is why we’re on the brink of the first ever nationwide fuel strike.

The government seems clueless about what is going on. The delivery of the fuel touches every part of our lives – our cars, buses, shops, businesses, schools, street lighting… you name it, it needs fuel. But the distribution of it is left entirely to the free market. It is crazy.

They say that we’re greedy but could they cope with £9,000 being loped off their wages overnight? Could they turn a blind eye to the safety abuses we see day in, day out?""*

We're now in 2012 and I wonder if it's still actually required?

If someone wants to have a child, good for them. But shouldn't part of that decision making process involve them examining their finances to see if they can actually afford it?

I'd rather tax money went to those who are disabled, can't get a job, etc, instead of people who think the state should pay towards their sprogs.

I view all parts of Britain in a similar way in this respect, I don't regard Northern Ireland or Scotland as being less any less a part of the UK than Yorkshire or Somerset. Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Cardiff have been as central to the prosperity and culture of Britain as any other cities in the country, except perhaps London. And tbh I think a lot of the recent talk about independence is due to people suddenly reclassifying their relationship with the rest of the country without too much justification, i.e. it's more a matter of fashion than of content. But equally, if any area doesn't want to be part of the Union, and validates that with a fairly organized referendum, they're absolutely within their rights to leave, and the rest of the country has no right to second guess, or block that decision.",0,1333232275,null,0,false,0,c4738ae,t3_rmspt,t1_c4738ae,t3_rmspt,null,1428631402,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

However, as far as bringing along older regenerations, you'll run into several issues concerning how you explain they look much older than they ever were and so on (not required for 8 as we never see him regenerate). Sure, they did some wibbly wobbly explanation for Time Crash, but the 50th anniversary requires something more substantial than that.

As for 10, sure we got the meta-crisis 10 in Pete's world, but that was kind of a closed chapter. Rose had her entire family and someone to grow old with, it's done. Bring back that 10 and you're pretty much obliged to bring along Rose too. 

What they could do, is make 11 get stuck somewhere, so it won't even matter if he remembers or not.
