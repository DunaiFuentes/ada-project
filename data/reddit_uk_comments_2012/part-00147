true,redem,null,null,"I fail to see how any of this is smugness, unless you're defining that in some way I am unfamiliar with. I think I am right and that they are wrong and I see no reason not to say so and to explain why. This is the entire basis for the great Public Conversation that is culture, community and is how society changes over time. I find the idea that we should not criticise other peoples ideas as... dangerous.

I do not aim to be offensive at all, although causing offence and mockery have their place in rhetoric, this is something you're reading between the lines. Shorthand for ""making up entirely"". I simply advocate for treating believers as adults, not children who may be shielded from reality to spare their feelings, or often exposed to it slowly and gently with much hand holding and support.

However, as an easy example, young earth creationists are wrong. Blatantly and obviously wrong. They have no excuse for being so pigheadedly wrong after being exposed to the facts. It says quite something for their character that they maintain their wrongness, seeking excuses, accusing scientists of conspiracy and fraud, falling back on relativism which they don't really believe in but imagine is a fine defence for some reason.

I do not respect them or their position, and I don't think anyone else should either.

Worse, they're not content with simply being wrong. Many of them feel the need to brainwash as many children as they can into the same nonsense, as can be seen in America.

He was kind of a cunt to HARRY specifically but he also saved Harry's life and literally gave up his own to keep Harry safe.

I did my learning from October 04, my bday, till April 05 when I passed. Ray was very patient, very flexible in his teaching and always reassuring. I passed my test first time round and this was all down to Ray's teaching. I had about 7-8 weeks wait time between my Theory and Practical during which time I did nothing but practice tests which really helped with my prep.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"I'll give my view in simple terms. Apologies if it's a bit of a ramble. 

Once upon a time there was a man named Jimmy Savile, he had a TV show called Jim'll Fix It where children were encouraged to write in with wishes, Jim then fixed it for some of those wishes to come true. 

He looked so ridiculous because he was a bit of an oddball, he was pretty flamboyant. 

Since he died some people have come out and said that Jim did bad things to them when they were younger, that he touched them in their special place and things like that. Since that has happened, all sorts of other things have been said by many many people, all of which make it look like Jim may have been a very bad man indeed. Because he was a bit of an oddball people are more inclined to believe what is being said, some are even saying they 'knew it all along' and things like that, because he was a bit of a weirdo. Dead people can't defend themselves. 

At the same time, some ladies who worked for the BBC years ago have come out and said that they themselves were touched when they were working at the BBC. 

It's a big mess right now with accusations everywhere. The newspapers are loving it to the point that at some times I feel they are glad that these people were (allegedly) touched-up when they were kids, because it gives the papers the chance to try and really hurt a big target, the BBC. 

Oh and two final things that have come to my mind. 

In this country you can say pretty much whatever you want about a dead person, you can make almost any allegation without proof. It's more difficult to make such accusations when someone is alive, especially to the newspapers rather than to the police. 

I don't know what to believe, but I've really not liked the way this has all happened and I am becoming suspicious of everyone involved, including the alleged victims. A LOT of people appear to have made their minds up already.

Your point about the thousands of unemployed confirms my suspicions.  The reasons I'd considered an MBA (or Masters in Project Management) was that I have no professional qualifications in business, and I wanted to expedite entry somewhat into a career not previously linked to teaching.  

I'm not keen on remaining in a similar role (e.g. your suggestion of joining a training organisation) to be honest, as the position lacks the challenge that I look for in a career.

true,HogwartsNeedsWifi,dalek,Dalek,"It's most evident in the faces- you use anime eyes and mouths as placeholders for knowing what to actually draw. You should spend some time trying to draw things that you see, without trying for a certain style. As is you can draw and shade fairly well. That hand and screw driver look excellent, for example. It's kind of difficult to explain what you're doing with the rest of the picture, but I'll try. It seems like you have preset parts that you're putting together. This is how I draw this hair, how I draw this arm, how I draw these clothes. You're good at drawing them THAT way, but when you have to stretch or move them, you fail because you haven't tried to develop actual drawing skills. You draw like you're writing a sentence- putting letters together to form a word. It's most evident with Bolin's raised arm. To make that look natural you would have to raise his right shoulder and lower his left one. Turn his body towards the doctor maybe, and make it lean in. Their eyes are both far too wide, and you didn't put much thought into what their actual eyes look like. You clearly have the ability to draw better, because you drew what you wanted to draw very well. You just need to start drawing from life, and again, don't worry about drawing in a specific style.

If you are happy to get the train and walk in (I have also done that from Selly Oak) They are plenty of other areas. I would go slightly further than Selly Oak (as it is very Studenty, lived there for 3 years myself) and consider Bourneville or you could go the other way to Sutton on Coalfield.


Other areas to consider are Edgebaston Reservoir (maybe pushing it a bit for walking distance would be about 3 miles).

true,Sjreed,null,null,"I found your comment quite interesting in that we need to transition, but I have a very different perspective, which is based on utilising capitalism and technology to do so. I think capitalism will be around for quite a while a longer, I just think it will be less important in the future due to technology. The nature of our system leads to technological disruptions that make things cheaper and benefit the innovators that provide them with money/market share. This has happened with the internet, information is cheaper than ever and anyone with access to the internet can learn pretty much anything for free. The next few decades will see similar disruptions happening more frequently in a manner of areas through emerging technologies such as robotics, renewable energies, computing and 3D printing to name a few. When you can buy a solar panel and battery which will power your house for a lifetime off grid, without needing to rely on a company to provide it costs of living will decrease, likewise when technology is able to provide systems which use full robotic automation to provide enough food for the world. If the roads are full of solar powered self driving cars that anybody can use and access, everyone will be better off as a result. If we create efficient robotics that can recycle anything and everything, resources will lose their value massively. The key is to create a society with abundance and I believe capitalism and innovation will be the system that eventually gets us there, it wil take a while and be a rocky road, but attempting to change the system would be a step in the wrong direction in my opinion.

true,FlyinIrishman,null,null,"It took me a long time to warm to Anelka. For a good while I just thought he was an arrogant, spoiled, moody frenchman. It didtn help when he missed that penalty in the CL final and blamed it on the fact that he hadnt been given a chance to warm up! But I did warm to him, and was really disappointed in how poorly he and Alex were treated when it was decided they were surplus to requirements.

Another player I disliked for a good while was (apologies for blasphemy) Drogba. He got goals, but for a long time I felt he didnt give his all for us. At the time his diving and play-acting was a real issue, and then there were the games where, for one reason or another he **did not go down**, like the game against Liverpool after Benitez said he wasnt worried about Drogba because he was only a diver, or in the World cup for the Ivory Coast. These moments of pure, unabridled power showed the player that he could be, and just chose not to be on a regular basis while wearing the chelsea crest. But again, I came around and I think he started to give a bit more for the club and in the last couple seasons he would bleed blue blood all over the pitch before he'd give up - making him a chelsea legend.

So, since the only two players I actively disliked in recent years turned out to be pretty good for chelsea, I'm left with a couple players that I just never warmed to as a person, even if they were a good player:

* Benayoun
* Veron
* Kalou

* Crespo

I've seen clearly nice presenters with a pleasant interviewing style gradually become accusatory and condescending.  

I wouldn't find it such an issue if people like Paxman were arguing from a moral position but his only aim seems to be to belligerently trip up whoever he's interviewing. He'll ask a question then when a satisfactory answer is given he'll argue from the opposite position that might conflict with where his previous question was coming from just to undermine the interviewee. 

This kind of technique is worst when you have have two opposing views where one person might be more credible and have more weight to their argument than the other, he'll equally attack both which makes the viewer think the stances are equally valid. You often end the interviewer feeling that you've got no closer to the truth of the matter because like a lawyer he'll use any argument to advocate a certain opinion even if it's bullshit.

He'll play devils advocate to the nth degree no matter how outlandish which you saw in the Conrad Black interview. Black makes a reasonable point that you shouldn't rule out a ""criminal"" serving in the lords if there is question over their guilt and Jeremy acts like that's the equivalent of a pedo presiding of child safety laws. That is daily mail level of smear and hysterical exaggeration. 

It's so refreshing when I watch other news outlets where by the end of the interview I feel like the interviewee has been able to make their case and I've got closer to understanding what they stand for without them being hen pecked by some douche.

It may have pre-Christian origins here in Celtic tradition http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain 

or it may be from the medieval tradition of 'souling' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souling 

In fact there are several credible sources for the tradition many of which go way back before major European settlement of the Americas.

It's probably an amalgamation of various regional traditions drawn from Germanic, Celtic and Christian sources that marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. 

Many of these traditions died out because they were actively suppressed by civil and religious authorities as being 'catholic' or 'pagan' and so very few communities carried on the traditions beyond the 17th c. Hence why most British people *think* it's an American import, because it was exported to America and then re-imported from there after it had all but died out here.

However I'm not going to be drawn too much into guessing whether it was the right decision at the time until the full inquiry is concluded and the facts are out (and especially because I have serious doubts about the impartiality of media reporting in this case, from both sides).

Additionally, the cancellation of the Newsnight report is such a minor issue when compared with the issue of how Savile was free to commit these alleged crimes for so long. ",0,1351101410,null,0,false,0,c6r56bm,t3_11yabv,t1_c6r56bm,t1_c6qqp6a,null,1430228765,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

*Who owns The Crown Estate?*

*The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch 'in right of The Crown', that is, it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign, by virtue of their accession to the throne. But it is not the private property of the monarch - it cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.*

*The Government also does not own The Crown Estate. It is managed by an independent organisation - established by statute - headed by a Board (also known as The Crown Estate Commissioners), and the surplus revenue from the estate is paid each year to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.*

*To explain further, one analogy that could be used is that The Crown Estate is the property equivalent of the Crown jewels - part of the national heritage and held by Her Majesty The Queen as sovereign, but not available for her private use.*

Thus the Royal Family have no right to the income derived from this property, and really we have no need to pretend its theirs. The government is said not to ""own"" it, but really it's recognised that this is public land, held in trust.

If we were to dissolve the monarchy it would not affect that income - the former queen could not walk away with the crown jewels and pawn them. ",0,1351110738,null,0,false,0,c6r7xgo,t3_11zvhx,t1_c6r7xgo,t1_c6r7f2l,null,1430230064,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I mean, if you believe the royals are entitled to that land because their great-great-great-great-grandfather came over here with William of Normandy then you're not going to vote (in a hypothetical referendum) for the proposal. 

The whole point of dissolving the monarchy is a statement that we want every citizen to get a fair and equal start in life, and as part of a whole raft of other reforms.

However, it's pretty clear from TrolleyPower's link (read the FAQ page) that these estates, the ones that bring in Â£240m, are already recognised as *not* belonging to individual members of the Windsor family and that they're already held in trust for the public. 

It's a bit disingenuous to argue that the revenues of the Crown Estate is money that ""the royal family"" brings into the country as if that's revenue that would disappear if the position of king was abolished.

Whether you support or object to British republicanism, it's a political view, and trying to claim the royals ""bring us money"" is just hand-waving to distract from examining the core values of the matter. If you accept ""the royals bring money into the country"" you're just buying into a narrative which suits the hereditary wealthy.

Let me finally say that I arrived at these conclusions somewhat reluctantly myself. When I myself, as a young adult, was subjected to a rant like this from someone else 20 years ago, I just thought ""cor blimey, what a sideshow! what a distraction from the real issues"". The monarchy can put on silly clothes and inspect parades of horsemen all they like - they'll remain totally irrelevant to daily life and to the problems of corporate power and abuse which plague our society. 

I love British traditions - warm beer, cricketers on the village green and the monarch as head of the Church of England, an inoffensive church that no-one takes too seriously. I loved having a second house of impoverished hereditary lords and viscounts, peers who were (theoretically, at least) above party politics and only in place to curb the excesses of the temporarily-incumbent government.

However, I am vehemently against people being born into poverty, having to lead disadvantaged lives and being told ""oh, that's fair - it's just life that some other people have it easy"". And I came to realise that you can't support - or oppose - the one without the other.

Having royalty is wholly symbolic of an inequal society, and you can't say to the kids from that shitty council estate in Tottenham, ""don't riot, you have to work for a living"" when they see Harry Windsor pissing it up and partying in Vegas. Well, you can say that, but it's totally hypocritical, and you should have no expectation of them listening.

Prison should be less about punishment and more about rehabilitation anyway.

Your argument seems to be based on a hypothetical choice that does not exist. 

Your pandering argument does not stand up I'm afraid. Prisoners make up less than 1pc of the British population. University students make up three times that...do you see the two main parties making concessions to get the student vote? Quite the opposite. In fact the Liberal Democrats demonstrated that the student vote was seen as completely redundant when they reneged on their promises, knowing that this would scupper future chances with student votes.

That sounds like a great idea.

I don't really know what a ""class system"" is.

All I know is that we don't have to allow the kids of rich people to wallow in unearned wealth - that's something we as a society permit, and can choose to question or reform it.

When someone says ""they should have to work for a living"", we all know who is being referred to. We don't question for a moment that it's *poor* people who ""should have to work for a living"", that they shouldn't be supported by the rest of us. But this is not a standard that is ever applied to rich people - it's just fine for them to have a trust fund and a life of ease. 

The monarchy are a symbol and personification of hereditary privilege, and if you support them then you're also in support of others being born poor and to a harder life. ",0,1351116733,null,0,false,0,c6r9mzh,t3_11zvhx,t1_c6r9mzh,t1_c6r9fhy,null,1430230873,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I have no idea what actually happened but for 2 investigators to come to such different conclusions does seem odd.

2) The London child abuse scandels of the 90's are directly connected to the Jersey scandel.

3) Numerious people reported Mr Savile to the police but were ignored because he was famous.

4) These are the same police who shopped people to papers for money and are now getting off because the enquiry is about ""nasty press people"" rather than ""shit head corrupt police poeple!""

true,strolls,null,null,"CGP Grey was *exactly* the video I had in mind - people like to trot it out when the monarchy is mentioned, but reality it's CGP Grey presenting the political view that CGP Grey likes the monarchy.

Grey ends that video by saying ""remove the royal family from government and nothing would be different except now you wouldnât live in the magical United Kingdom but the rather dull United Republic of Britain"".

Yet this is a ridiculous premise because of course we're not going to *just* scrap the monarchy - the measure could only occur in a much more enlightened political atmosphere, and it would happen as part of a whole load of other social, political and economic changes. 

Grey's figures of how much money we get from the royals seem to be based on the income from The Crown Estate, but those estates have been held in trust for the public for centuries and I think it's pretty ludicrous we should pretend they should be returned to the Windsor family, just because great-great-great-great-great-grandad Windsor (or whoever) came over here with William of Normandy.

Grey is basically asking us to buy into this premise that King George was entitled to this massive wealth through hereditary privilege. He doesn't even *ask* us to do that - he just assumes it's right, and carries on talking without allowing time for dissent. I mean, has Grey even questioned this himself? Or does he just believe that the Windsors own this land because that's the way it's always been done?

Grey enjoys his own arguments, but those he picks and chooses. I think it's pretty clear that CGP Grey wasn't born and raised in the council estates of Tottenham or Merthyr Tydfil, because if he had he wouldn't be making all the assumptions he does. He says that royalty only costs us Â£0.65 pence each, and how the tourists love 'em, but he doesn't touch on fairness or justice, he doesn't tell us why Charles Windsor should be privileged to the job over Waliyah from Walthamstow. And that's a very important question to address, if you're standing up for this shit. 

Grey has basically started out with the premise ""I like royalty"" (and everything that goes with it to make Britain British) and come up with a bunch of arguments to support what he likes. He never started this asking, ""well, why *should* we have royalty?"" like he's properly dubious of the institution. This is *not* a system we'd choose if we were starting now from scratch, and it's very right to question its validity. 

I've said some more about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/11zvhx/the_queen_having_a_giggle_at_prince_philips/c6r95qi?context=3), and I'd be grateful if you could read that comment first, if you're inclined to reply to me. I feel like I'm a reluctant republican because I like the idea of British tradition, because I feel the royals are an irrelevance and because there's so many other important issues we face. As a republican I don't really expect to see the monarchy ousted even in my lifetime, but if we consider what the purpose of government should be, I don't see how anyone can possibly defend them.

Dzeko doesn't do this (it seems to me that he spends his time thinking of ever more creative ways to get caught offside), and when Aguero drops deep he tends to pop up on the left-hand side rather than in the centre.  There's a gaping hole in the middle of the pitch and there seems to be little interest in occupying that space.

The things he did weren't legally binding, rather they were something akin to memos from a CEO to departments under him on how he would like to see them run. The next president in office can overturn them, or congress can pass legislation overriding the order. He is completely within the constitution, and was using them as more instantaneous edicts that wouldn't have to be bogged down in congress.

2) The recess appointment was made completely constitutionally, the gripe here, is that the recess appointment was made *under 10 days after a recess* which the republicans were trying to block by holding sessions every three days, a move that is without precedent, but not illegal. The republicans had already made a record number of blocks and caused the failing of appointing someone, not based on the merits of the individual, but as a stance against the agency he was to be heading, a move also unprecedented in the history of US Congress.

3) Yeah, ok, you got me there that was pretty shitty, but I would just like to point out that Obama just legalized all the same things that Bush had been doing for 8 years, this is nothing new, it just codified it. 

4) This appears to be condemning the allotment of troops to Libya in regards to enforcing the no fly zone? Best I can figure? This doesn't seem to support one way or the other, as our troops weren't engaging in combat. Further more, the president doesn't have to get Congressional approval to move troops abroad, only to engage in war. According to the War Powers Act of 1973, the president can commit troops abroad and notify congress 48 hours in advance. This was put in to place to expedite the US's ability to engage in armed conflicts abroad. Again, nothing unconstitutional.

My thoughts after a quick look at it... Â£6/week on stamps?  First off, most applications are done online now anyway. Second, I can't really see 10 applications being sent off per week. Third, while you're in town for the interview, hand deliver some applications/CVs; that looks so much better to a potential employer than just posting it.
For postage, I'd say Â£2.40/week (4 first class stamps; or get off your arse, send it early and only need 2nd class, get 6 stamps!)

TV licence? Forget it. You don't *need* TV if you're scraping by. Instead use online catch-up services such as OD or iPlayer. Saved - Â£2.80.  Hang on though, I thought there was precious little time for socialising? But there's still time to watch TV? Hmm.

Travel at Â£5 for one trip?  Walk. Catch a lift. Cycle. Unless train or bus is really the only way, there's no excuse. Worried about creasing your shirt and smelling sweaty? Well, wear your jeans and tee, leave in time so when you get there, you have 10 minutes to go to the bathroom, change into the suit and freshen up a bit.   Saved - Â£5

Food at 7.70/week? That's just about do-able if you really scrape by.  Perhaps buy a cucumber, tomato, lettuce and pepper to make a salad most days. Add a bit of chicken thigh which is very cheap, or bacon the next day, and cheese the day after. Then pasta one night. A nice big value box of 'flaked corn' for breakfast.  But hang on... I helped you save Â£11.40 extra though unnecessary stuff - go wild, have branded cereal! Â£19.10 per week is about what all of my student friends spend per week on food bills.

And about having no time for social life... All my friends that were on job seekers spent most of their days sitting at home, or in their garden, chilling with friends.

I would appreciate if in future you word your response as less of a messy jibe, and a more considered critique.

Not only did they compare him to Mata but they even compared him to Drogba and Eto'o, the entire week you guys filled /r/Soccer with a graph comparing him to Drogba and Eto'o, do a little search and you will find it.

It is not even online, I live with a lot of Arsenal locals most of which are regulars to games and they pull off this same shit each and every single season. At the start of the season you lot said Chelsea had run out of it's luck and Di Matteo would finish at 6th to 7th while you placed yourself to the 1-3rd spots. Then as soon as reality sets in you all start saying ""Oh we never said that"". You guys even had the guts to say that you played better than us and deserved to win in the last match, did you watch your team not even put up a fight in the last 30 odd minutes of the match? Even I expected more who rates Arsenal as a barely top 4 side and yet you still are on your high horse not understanding how badly you should have lost.

Typical Arsenal fans always over hyping your own players thinking the rest of the league does not exist. Now you are pulling the same stint with your lord and savior Cazorla who could do fuck all while Mikel had him in his pocket, while [Hazard and Mata ran past your team like you were a relegation struck bottom of the championship side](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/11ughn/juan_mata_best_cam_in_the_world_right_now/c6ptwoc).

I said I'm talking about both the online community and those who have season tickets. I think that gives me a pretty good base group to work with.

&gt;I have never rated Gervinho, he had a decent spell at the beginning of the season but that's it. 

That was the period where he became better than Mata for all other Arsenal fans too. When his form dipped and reality set in, you turned against him. Ramires has the same dips in form and heck he had two or three good games this season while previously he was very good but we don't abuse him and make him the butt of every joke/mistake like Gervinho is treated by you all these days. Then you say that us Chelsea fans are spoiled. 


&gt;And its pointless trying to deny that Cazorla is an amazing player.

He is amazing but not as amazing as you make him to be. Definitely not the best signing, definitely not the best midfielder right now in the league. Nor was he going to be the best midfielder in the Premiership as you all predicted even before he touched a ball. One of the top ones is a more valid assessment.

&gt;we were well in for a draw or even a win, and if it wasn't for Cech, it probably would've been.

Chelsea controlled the game and were the better side. That is what you cannot even admit. I can also say that if it weren't for Gervinho we would have be 0-2 up instead of 1-2. The contribution of a goal keeper is no different from the contribution of any other player, if Cole headed a ball away that was going to be scored and Cech made a punch that was going to end up in the back of the net then neither are different. Just because Cech makes the save instead of Terry clearing it does not mean that you got the control of the game or it was a bigger threat. We expect Cech to make these saves, if you stopped listening to the cliche commentators with their ""not same after the injury comments"" you would see how he refuses to concede and is the biggest reason for our best defense in the league status this season. No other defender has contributed more than him.",0,1351161500,null,0,false,0,c6rhq9z,t3_120y3s,t1_c6rhq9z,t1_c6rhn7v,null,1430234760,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1

Labour improved the financial situation of the country during its time in power and it left it capable of borrowing money at historically low rates.

I don't say that the UK chose to institute cuts by choice lightly. Every other country that cut did so because of immediate demands from Germany or by a run on their bonds.

EDIT to reply to your ninja edit:

Cutting investment spending is the opposite of creating a framework for private sector job creation.

Also, the rules of demand are different in a depressed economy. Everybody's income is somebody else's spending. Right now, the private sector needs to cut its spending in order to pay down its debt. If the government cuts as well then we enter a spiral of everybody getting pay cuts, so reducing their spending, so more pay cuts, so less spending...  For the government (the institution in the country which is most able to borrow money at the lowest rates due to being the safest) to spend in order to counter this makes perfect sense.

The UK has a large enough minority ethnic population that there are plenty of children being born to ""UK born women"" that the BNP would still take issue with.

I've not got the figures to hand, but from what I recall the birth rates to non-white women tend to stay high for the first couple of generations, before lowering towards the UK average.

Then the people you know are probably delusional, die-hard fans. A lot of us are realistic.

&gt;That was the period where he became better than Mata for all other Arsenal fans too. When his form dipped and reality set in, you turned against him. Ramires has the same dips in form and heck he had two or three good games this season while previously he was very good but we don't abuse him and make him the butt of every joke/mistake like Gervinho is treated by you all these days. Then you say that us Chelsea fans are spoiled. 

I honestly never heard anyone say he was better than anyone. Everyone was saying he had improved, which admittedly he has, but he hasn't improved enough. He scored a few tap ins and that decent goal against Chelsea but other than that he just takes the ball into the corner and loses it. He's not good enough, I think it's understandable to be annoyed at one guy who is arguably ruining our entire attacking flow, by losing the ball so much and taking an entire century to decide what to do with it.

&gt;Chelsea controlled the game and were the better side. That is what you cannot even admit. I can also say that if it weren't for Gervinho we would have be 0-2 up instead of 1-2. The contribution of a goal keeper is no different from the contribution of any other player, if Cole headed a ball away that was going to be scored and Cech made a punch that was going to end up in the back of the net then neither are different. Just because Cech makes the save instead of Terry clearing it does not mean that you got the control of the game or it was a bigger threat.

Better side? Probably. Controlled the game? No, they did not. The first half was a pretty equal battle. We had chances, you had chances. There was no dominant side, Chelsea's goals came from sloppy defending and goalkeeping during set-pieces.

It is still falling now - remarkable given the double dip. 

&gt; The structural deficit was technically created by Labour?

It was - they started off with surplus, then went to 2% in about 2001 where it stayed (when it should have been eradicated, during the boom years) and then it shot up when the crisis hit (to be expected under any regime). This single policy is one of the fundamental problems with the economy, which needs to be corrected. 

&gt; The deficit was 42% when they came to power and 35% before the crisis hit

I don't know what figures you are talking about. The deficit is the total difference between revenue and receipts. The total debt has been rising decades. Giving total debt figures as a percentage if GDP is a little bit irrelevant when comparing to historic UK figures as the market's attitude to debt has fundamentally changed.

&gt; The debt that was added in the recession isn't structural; it's cyclical, that is, short-term and directly caused by the recession

Yes the recession defcit is cyclical - but its added to the structural deficit - to make the total deficit - which makes the whole situation so much worse, and the thing that ultimately means we are living beyond our means. That has to change. Saying otherwise is burying your head in the sand. Not doing it now is simply putting it off and potentially making it much worse, if it impacted on interest payments (which is absolutely has in Italy, Spain et al.)

You seem to have missed the point. The offences you mentioned above are clearly unacceptable to the majority and I hope they always will be. However, our elected legislators have the power to criminalise anything at all, and so there is always the possibility that they will criminalise things that we as a society actually find acceptable. Why does that not tend to happen? Because we have the power to vote them out if they do it. But what if they systematically remove that power from people who actively object? Then we no longer can. Allowing prisoners to vote provides a safeguard in that it limits what could plausibly be criminalised by a future government that wished to subvert democracy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I like the idea if it was actually going to stop welfare recipients having more children. But it won't. And those children that they continue to have would suffer all the more. If anything it would simply increase crime and child abuse by adding extra pressure to families who already struggle to cope and can't operate within middle class rules. Tightening the noose financially without providing better opportunities to people is very, very cruel.

Healthy, happy kids from good homes don't just sit down one day and decide to raise a family on welfare. When someone winds up in that position, something in their life drove them there. Very often it's because of their own childhood and poor schooling, they don't believe there is anything better for them. Like the doctor's kids that go on to university, welfare kids very often follow their parents' lead. 

Schools and society in general do *nothing* to mitigate this, instead we prefer to judge and blame those people and their offspring, and then continue to shut them out and deny them dignity and chances in life. Imagine how it feels when your own government hates your existence and prefers to make your life harder.

In any case, these are not people who have a proven track record for 'looking ahead' and making sensible decisions in life. This idea of expecting feckless and ignorant people (which many on welfare are) to suddenly wake up and start being responsible is going to lead to disappointment and misery. You can not apply middle class values and expectations to people who grew up in decidedly *not* middle class environments. These Tory ideas betray a real lack of knowledge or intelligence, or perhaps it is barefaced hate and cruelty.

I believe there are much kinder and more effective ways to reduce welfare needs. We could make it easier for people to transition from welfare to work i.e. tapering down benefits instead of having a hard cut-off. We could improve adult education opportunities. We could increase minimum wage.

The nightmare scenario (which presumably the treasury is extremely mindful of) is that you spend more money, you don't get the growth you need as the EU is still shagged and China / USA dont do so well... you are left with a shit ton more debt, a gov that doesn't look serious about cutting the deficit and little extra GDP.

true,Galerath,null,null,"I see what you did there, but it doesn't change the point. Labour is a commodity and it has a value in relation to how available it is. A skilled and experienced worker in an obscure but in demand field is worth much more than somebody with a few crappy GCSEs to their name. 

Bizarrely the minimum wage and high cost of living in the UK are what drive companies to offer piss take wages like this. Somebody is probably willing to work for that Â£2.65 per hour because they have no skills, they need money and there are so few unskilled jobs on offer. 

Of course the reason there are very few unskilled jobs on offer is because all the unskilled work is outsourced to countries where they don't have to pay them so much. Why pay somebody in the UK Â£6~ per hour when you can pay somebody in China Â£6 a day?

So, all the unskilled jobs are outsourced, but there's still plenty of unskilled labour in the UK (because people tend not to move about), so you have lots of people who can do the work and no work to do, so the value of their time drops as there's a surplus of supply and no demand. This of course is circular - the more unskilled labour there is, the less they're worth, so the more attractive it is for companies to outsource, so the more they do so, etc.

Arguably the cycle could be broken by repealing the minimum wage and letting market forces take effect on the labour market. However that's not acceptable because people think they deserve Â£6 to serve tea and coffee and this is a democracy, so the better solution is to encourage better education and produce more skilled workers who are in demand. This is where the government is failing as they're determined to make education more expensive and out of reach on the lower classes.

true,borbus,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I think that skills are far more important than facts.  Armed with the skills of reading, writing, critical thinking and being able to find the information (use a library), children can learn all the facts that they want.  And better still, they can consult multiple sources and make up their own minds about conflicting information instead of taking their teacher's word for it.

I actually think that adults teaching children facts can be incredibly damaging.  Children see the world differently to adults.  Adults are blinkered by comparison.  This is why children are a gift: they provide a brand new perspective of the world, completely untarnished.  Unfortunately, for most of them their perspective is tarnished before they even start school.  Nothing destroys a child's innocence like religion.

Culture survives through skills, not knowledge.  Language skills especially.  But skills like being able to cook and clean.  That's culture too.  It's shocking how many people under the age of 30 don't know how to wash dishes.

The article points out that knowledge is necessary for comprehension of textbooks and that's true, but we actually have technology now that makes that completely irrelevant.  Anyone who uses Wikipedia will understand: if you're reading an article and a name or term comes up that you are not familiar with, you click it.  This isn't exclusive to Wikipedia, it's just web technology (the World Wide Web in this case).

Of course, only a tiny fraction of the information you might find in a library can be found on the Web today so, although the technology is in place, it can't completely replace the old fashioned way yet.

No it isn't unless you agree with slavery, and in this way classical capitalist theory is a pathology relying on the wilful denial of access to land. Literally, communities are denied the ability to grow their own food in any meaningful way. The most egregious example was Vietnam where agent orange was used against the people to destroy crops to force migration into industrial centres. The same thing happened in this country  during the enclosure period, then in modern times perpetuated by the ""greenbelt"" and very restrictive planning laws. The landed gentry after stealing most is now sustained in various artificial means, CAP handouts to support inefficient land use would be one example. If you do manage to get hold of a bit of land, tree protection orders can be used against you should you want to turn it into a sustainable coppicing scheme.

Colonialism never really ended at any level, for the rich it is a wealth by impoverishment. This is more than apparent in ""fixing"" the economy. Let's say they have actually returned to growth and it wasn't creative accounting: people have been denied education, students have taken on more debt, households have taken on more debt, and many have been forced into precarious employment which includes both temporary, low and no paid positions. Police like the NHS is being privatised, the government had to print money, 5milÂ£ was given to fund an armed coup in Syria, the Queen got a raise, the rich got a tax cut, corporations don't seem to be able to pay tax, and much more.

true,Galerath,null,null,"The difference between labour being a commodity and slavery is that the slave has no choice in who he is providing his labour to and is not paid for that labour, whilst a free citizen *does* have a choice and is paid. Slavery is when a *human being* is a commodity, not when somebody's time is a commodity.

And let's be clear: when you work for somebody else you are literally selling them your time. You turn up, you provide them with labour and they pay you for that labour. Thus, *labour is a commodity*. This applies to everyone, from the CEO to the cleaner - at some level they are all selling their time and effort in return for a wage, and that wage is determined by the availability of their skills and the perceived value of the job.

Case in point: I have in-demand skills, and if/when I seek to work for a company, I know that my time and skills are worth at the *very* least Â£12 per hour, so I won't sell them my time for less than that. Therefore, if I'm looking for a job, I look for jobs which offer more than my minimum price for my time and I try to maximize the wage+benefits on offer.

You seem to have gone flying off on a tangent about land ownership. I completely fail to see how growing your own food has anything to do with anything. But then again, I consider my time a commodity, and I know its worth more than the time it would take me to grow my own food, therefore, I am happy to buy food made by an industrial farm for far less than the value of the time it'd take me to do the same.",0,1351174685,null,0,1351175012,0,c6rjuwe,t3_1222z1,t1_c6rjuwe,t1_c6rjk5w,null,1430235832,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

This is nothing but a silly abstraction that tries to rationalise a sociopathic ideology which dehumanises people to a commodity. Yes, people, labour is intrinsically linked to a living being and is unable to exist on its own.

If everyone owned a home and had access to free food and energyâtrees produce plenty of burnable wood for very little input labour, the same goes with an established horticultural landscapeâthen the peasants are trapped in a socioeconomic system that allows wealth disposition through a multiple of means like interest payments, exorbitant food costs, fuel costs, mortgages, and an outrageous 40% tax theft (VAT + income). Poverty is thus by design and advantageous to the rich. It's also the reason why benefits are such a requirement, it juices the housing market and stops the ""natural"" destitution if the prevailing economic theory was allowed to be fully implemented.

The Doctor should be able to convincingly deliver joy, rage, wisdom, sadness, and the occasional astonishment or confusion, but never despair.

Also the Doctor (like the US President before him) needs to stop being a white guy all the time.

Unfortunately my live-action TV preferences currently consist of Alphas, Fringe, Sherlock, and the various programs directly connected to Doctor Who, and so I have a rather small pool of known acting talent from which to draw.

Lance Reddick could be a very interesting Doctor. He has a great voice, and is very rarely given roles that aren't all serious all the time. I think the Doctor would be a good role for him, too- it's definitely a position of authority, but a relaxed one, where he would get to be more friendly.

Lana Pulver could also be great. I don't know if I'd want the first female Doctor to be one who plays the Doctor the way Steven Moffat wrote Irene Adler (i.e. making the character sexy to the point that the character is about sex), because there'd probably be public backlash about the fact that that happened the moment the Doctor was a lady, and they might have a point there.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;This is nothing but a silly abstraction that tries to rationalise a sociopathic ideology which dehumanises people to a commodity. Yes, people, labour is intrinsically linked to a living being and is unable to exist on its own.

I think you're trivialising slavery by asserting that work is an abstraction of slavery. I am not owned by my boss. He does not own where I live, he does not tell me what I can and cannot do at any given point, he can't make me have children with somebody I don't want to have children with. He cannot claim ownership of any children I have. He cannot beat me, he cannot control my life. All he can do is direct me to do things for him whilst I'm at work, and then he has to provide me money in return for that work. That is not slavery in any way shape or form. It is a contract I had a choice to enter.

&gt;If everyone owned a home and had access to free food and energyâtrees produce plenty of burnable wood for very little input labour, the same goes with an established horticultural landscapeâthen the peasants are trapped in a socioeconomic system that allows wealth disposition through a multiple of means like interest payments, exorbitant food costs, fuel costs, mortgages, and an outrageous 40% tax theft (VAT + income). Poverty is thus by design and advantageous to the rich. It's also the reason why benefits are such a requirement, it juices the housing market and stops the ""natural"" destitution if the prevailing economic theory was allowed to be fully implemented

With regards to making your own food and energy, that's all very nice and 18th century, but it's utterly impossible and completely backwards in this day and age. Growing your own patch of food is far too inefficient to be self-sustaining without large tracts of land, which would require ending industrial farming and redistributing the land so that people can have enough to work on. This in turn would cause mass starvation as we require industrial farming and food imports to sustain the population.

Additionally, we can only have commodities because people specialise and produce things other than food and energy for themselves. You can only have a computer and be on the internet because there are people who design and build computers and design and build the infrastructure for them to communicate, etc. etc. Specialisation of labour provides us with all the luxuries we enjoy. If you want to renounce those luxuries and be self sufficient I suggest you get off the computer, move somewhere where you can afford some land and live off it.

If everyone has to go and grow their own food and make their own heat and energy, we can have no consumer products, no luxury, we can barely have civilisation, because all of the time and effort that skilled individuals put into specialised tasks suddenly has to be spent just keeping themselves alive. 

You are, in short, proposing a return to the dark ages. Yes, it gets rid of the rich whom you clearly despise, but it destroys our way of life at the same time.

Capitalism is flawed, yes, but I'd rather work my job and take my pay and live in my house and have a computer than spend all day toiling the earth just to survive.

Exactly this, and unfortunately I've found evidence of it in every town I've ever lived in. 

That doesn't mean that *you*, intangible_tangerine, are like this but to put it another way - if having lots of children is a real burden on either your family or the system supporting your family (through benefits) then is it wise to have so many children? 

And here we enter the grey area of how much autonomy a family should be allowed to have regarding how many children they choose to have. 

Fair enough you might *want* five kids, but can you support them? No? Then you probably should think twice about having them. 

Also, I hate to say it and it'll probably get down-voted for being insensitive but whatever. You can't say they had an ""accident"" then go on to say they weren't irresponsible in the next sentence.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"&gt; I think you're trivialising slavery by asserting that work is an abstraction of slavery.

Fine, call it occluded slavery, good PR. 

&gt; All he can do is direct me to do things for him whilst I'm at work, and then he has to provide me money in return for that work. That is not slavery in any way shape or form. It is a contract I had a choice to enter.

You might be lucky in that you have a choice of employment, but what happens when you can't get work? You are denied access to food, the council will take your house for lack of CT payments, if you have any other debts you may see a court date. You think you are free, but this freedom, although wider than perhaps South Africa if you are black or a black woman, is narrower than you think. What is freedom if it is a choice of selling oneself to this employer or that?

There is all manner of capital float around, pulled out of hats, paying for wars, paying bankers, paying for gratuities like ManU or Man City, and yet there is a surplus of labour in many cases skilled. Why can't these people work towards self empowerment rather than be forced to take subservient roles in corporate hierarchies?

&gt; we can have no consumer products, no luxury, we can barely have civilisation, because all of the time and effort that skilled individuals put into specialised tasks suddenly has to be spent just keeping themselves alive

Reducing labour (and by extension people) to a commodity is hardly civilised. Look around, your lifestyle as I presume a UK citizen is based on wealth dispossession all around the world as well as an internal enforced colonisation. 

&gt; Growing your own patch of food is far too inefficient to be self-sustaining without large tracts of land, which would require ending industrial farming and redistributing the land so that people can have enough to work on

Your understanding of farming is naive. Is flying in beans from kenya efficient? Oil, (wars, (armies)), tractors, pesticides, trains, planes, lorries, shelf stackers, plastic wrapping? I'll remind you that current UK food production is so inefficient that it requires massive subsidies in hard (eg CAP) and soft means. It is mostly through taxing the citizenry that the road network is maintained, which allows for out-of-town markets supported by you running home refrigeration and owning a car, and council tax to be used to pay for all the waste disposal. It's also a system that doesn't deliver the correct sorts of food and is a major contributor to obesity. To top it off, [billions of food is thrown away](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7389351.stm) both domestically and at the point of sale. That last ""feature"" is remarkable, they are incentivised to destroy and deny access to wealth maintaining profit, just like the housing market, just like education, and just like sick care where GDP rises as people suffer all manner of modern pathologies, real or imagined.

""I'm just nipping to the shops in my two tonne car to pick up some french beans for my pseudo-oriental stir fry.""

&gt; [Specificity in the job market]

Again this is more a way of keeping a workforce impotent whilst dehumanising people to little more than tools for a capitalist machineâhardly civilised behaviour.

&gt; primitivist ... dark ages

This is a straw man argument. I never said all people I said communities, however it could totally be argued that with access to land an individual with less than an hour a day in an established garden can feed a person with no money changing hands. In the UK the average person watches ~24 hours of television per week. What I want to see abolished is wealth accruement on the back of human debasement and environmental destruction.

They are not States in the sense of the USA as we do not use the Federal system so the term state is pretty meaningless.

They give some bodies some of their powers (eg. Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, NI Assembly) so these bodies can also make laws affecting their own 'countries'. England is the exception, there is no English Parliament so the UK Government passes all their laws via the UK National Parliament in Westminster.

So essentially each part of the UK is an administrative region that is known as a (constituent) Country. The key thing is the term constituent country does not have any defined legal meaning, and is used simply to refer to a country which is a constituent part of something else. So simply by being referred to as Countries then they are Countries.

Well technically we've got THE parliament, The Houses of Parliament are located in London and have been in session long before the Welsh and Scottish formed their own, but they're simply legislating beneath the overall law of the land, which I guess would be federal versus state laws in the US, though I hesitate to use the analogy since you seem pretty hung up on viewing the UK system as a version of the US one.",0,1351181812,null,0,false,0,c6rliqu,t3_122hxl,t1_c6rliqu,t1_c6rkz10,null,1430236618,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

1) They are in the Champions League every single year. When's the last time they weren't? Over a decade ago? Even if we're sitting in 3rd with a 12 point gap come January, can you tell me you'd be confident of us being in that competition next season? I sure couldn't. 

2) They have by consensus one of the greatest managers in world football. AVB may very well be spoken of in the same breath some day, but for now I think Wenger's track record speaks for itself. 

3) While they don't pay 150k a week like City or Chelsea, they still pay more than us. ""Almost the same"" is rarely good enough when money is involved. Look at Gylfi. We offered probably something like 10k more than Liverpool and he wanted them to match it. We were a better club from a footballing standpoint and on top of that we paid just slightly more. That's a no-brainer if I'm a player. 

4) It's easier to leave Arsenal than it is to leave Spurs. They will sell their best players to their ostensible rivals whereas we will hold you against your will until we either get the right price from a non-competitor. 

The only thing right now that we have in our favor is a shiny new training facility, and we might have an edge when it comes to South American and Portuguese players. 

People get carried away by the slightest shifts in form. Arsenal fans are over there contemplating suicide and saying they'll be lucky if they'll finish 8th. Two weeks ago they were title challengers. Meanwhile over here people who last month might have said Arsenal are realistically a more attractive destination are convinced we are a more attractive destination. 

Things don't change quite so quickly. I think we still have a few big steps to make before we can say we're just as an attractive destination as Arsenal. It's not an indictment on our club or praise of theirs; it's just reality. ",0,1351182666,null,0,false,0,c6rlrhs,t3_120yac,t1_c6rlrhs,t1_c6rgzh1,null,1430236730,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;You might be lucky in that you have a choice of employment, but what happens when you can't get work? You are denied access to food, the council will take your house for lack of CT payments, if you have any other debts you may see a court date. You think you are free, but this freedom, although wider than perhaps South Africa if you are black or a black woman, is narrower than you think. What is freedom if it is a choice of selling oneself to this employer or that?

If you want to define that as a lack of freedom, then your freedom is also curtailed by your need for oxygen, food and water.

&gt;Reducing labour (and by extension people) to a commodity is hardly civilised. Look around, your lifestyle as I presume a UK citizen is based on wealth dispossession all around the world as well as an internal enforced colonisation

Romanticising labour as somehow special and not subject to the laws of supply and demand is the kind of thinking that lead to the economic misery of the Soviet Union.

&gt;Your understanding of farming is naive. 

I wonder if you grow all your own food?

&gt;Is flying in beans from kenya efficient? Oil, (wars, (armies)), tractors, pesticides, trains, planes, lorries, shelf stackers, plastic wrapping?

Yes, in the sense that it costs less than it would cost me in terms of my time, which is translatable to money.

&gt;I'll remind you that current UK food production is so inefficient that it requires massive subsidies in hard (eg CAP) and soft means.

That's not because farming is inefficient, rather, it's because the same goods could be produced much more cheaply abroad. The cost of living and the cost of farming in the UK means that in a completely free market, we'd immediately cease most of our food production. This is obviously a strategically bad idea, so we subsidise food to maintain a means to produce at least some of the food we eat. 

The fact that industrialised farming using heavy machinery and powerful fertilisers, etc. cannot produce enough food to feed the UK should immediately tell you that it is impossible for the citizenry to feed themselves off the land. 

&gt;This is a straw man argument. I never said all people I said communities, however it could totally be argued that with access to land an individual with less than an hour a day in an established garden can feed a person with no money changing hands. 

Can *partially* feed a person. And although no money changes hands, somebody has had to invest their time in farming. Time that could be spent in other ways.

&gt;In the UK the average person watches ~24 hours of television per week.

You seem to have pulled the classic trick of citing an irrelevant fact to make your argument look stronger. 

&gt;What I want to see abolished is wealth accruement on the back of human debasement and environmental destruction. Seen, unseen, here and abroad.

Farming is in itself environmental destruction. You have to destroy an environment to replace it with crops. Of course it's also environmental creation - creation of an environment for ourselves. If you wish to create a dichotomy between ""nature"" and ""man made"" then the very existence of man will inevitably destroy and reshape nature.",0,1351183148,null,0,false,0,c6rlwi0,t3_1222z1,t1_c6rlwi0,t1_c6rkwu0,null,1430236796,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But Donna's departure what just horrid on my heart. When Rose left, she is at least with her mother and father and she has memories of the doctor and she ends up getting her own human copy of the Doctor for keeps! where as donna forgets everything.

Having said that, we do have a chance.

No it's a simple fact that we borrowed a load of money (like everywhere) to bail out the banks and sure up the country. Weird that anyone would dispute that - it was a globally recognised necessary step. Saying something is Daily Mail is not an argument is it? 

However what is also necessary is to pay that money back, and since now the country cannot rely on easy steady growth anymore we have to fix the structural deficit otherwise we simply sink into further and further debt, spending more &amp; more money on interest and less on society.

She didn't even believe in him at first when he first arrived back at her house. She had no idea Mels was River until ""Let's Kill Hitler"", so that barely matters. Even so, we're only choosing to stay with Eleven in this conversation. What of Martha, Donna, Captain Jack, and Mickey? The Doctor was still the titular character, but despite being very important characters, they all had lives of their own to a huge degree. Jack even had an entire spinoff full of a shitload of alien hunting that The Doctor played no part in whatsoever. Just because a companion exists does not mean that their life revolves around The Doctor, and I'm with the OP, it really sucks when it does. So far, Eleven's companions have been way too important to him. 

Consider [this image](http://i.imgur.com/YPrB0.jpg) that pops up on the subreddit from time to time. The companions, no matter what they do, *have* to be replaceable. They will without question be replaced all the way until the show ceases to exist. So to build a couple of them up as being cosmically important to The Doctor's life itself (beyond saving it every so often) is silly, since without a doubt, there will come a point where they don't matter so much any more.

So no, the bank bailout has nothing to do with the structural deficit, as it was removed from the public balance sheet. It is also not necessary to 'pay it back' because it is just money that is invested in the banks' share values, and will be released when those shares are sold.

&gt; That was cyclical reduction though - not structural (which is once you take away the effects of the recession). 

The structural deficit isn't that bad when compared to the effects of the massive deficit caused by the huge fall in GDP in 2008. It was that deficit that needed urgently addressing at the time (and since), which is what Labour's growth was doing in their last year.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"&gt; If you want to define that as a lack of freedom, then your freedom is also curtailed by your need for oxygen, food and water.

None of these things should require subordination in the civilised world. Food is literally over abundant, yet it remains costly which seems to defy classic economics. Imagine how quickly the established powers would quickly fall if food was free at the point of use, yet that would be the humanitarian ideal. Why do you think during the cold war with Russia the soldiers were marching into places like Chile, Argentina, Grenada, Haiti, [Guatemala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d'%C3%A9tat) and Cuba (which was a special case)? Land reform is essentially what all peoples have wanted, to gain independence from western powers. It's what is playing out in places like Iran right now through sanctions, and more apparent is the Palestinian apartheid.

&gt; I wonder if you grow all your own food?

I'm on the way and I have only got a suburban plot. The summer months are easy, reclaiming skills and wisdom is a little bit harder.

&gt; That's not because farming is inefficient, rather, it's because the same goods could be produced much more cheaply abroad.

Through the use of slash-n-burn, deforestation, and slave labour practices. Your cushy life is on the backs of deaths in places like Iraq, Libya, Zimbabwe and China. You risk your children's prosperity in playing that game and we are seeing it in the stock market with speculative trading.

&gt; The fact that industrialised farming using heavy machinery and powerful fertilisers, etc. cannot produce enough food to feed the UK should immediately tell you that it is impossible for the citizenry to feed themselves off the land.

If that is truly the case then we are locked into a colonial system that will be enforced by military rule over the third world. However, it is choice. There are so many green spaces that could contribute to food security. You rule a people be denying them food. Yes, we are unfree in terms of environmental pre-requisites for life, but abstract politics and wilful denial of prosperity is something different entirely.

&gt; Farming is in itself environmental destruction. You have to destroy an environment to replace it with crops.

It's only destructive if we leave the environment in a less fertile state for subsequent generations. Modern agriculture literally destroys and thins soils, and this is measurable, but there are alternatives that actually reverse the process, building soil and sequestering carbon out of the atmosphere whilst importantly lessening flooding.",0,1351186557,null,0,false,0,c6rmxrf,t3_1222z1,t1_c6rmxrf,t1_c6rlwi0,null,1430237296,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

People make such ludicrous statements about how easy life on benefits is, but for most people it's a financial struggle, council houses tend to be in the most deprived areas with the worst-performing schools. That's not something that anyone who's had the opportunity to foster personal ambition wants. 

I want a government which will address the wider issues around people who opt not to work rather than arbitrarily decide that limiting those on benefits to two children will immediately solve everyone's problems. Subjecting people who are already poor and disenfranchised is only going to increase levels of poverty and disenfranchisement.

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I've gone over that a hundred times in conversation with my friends. I think it would be great to bring back the meta-crisis Doctor as a modern take on the Valeyard. We know a couple things about him: 1. He has all the memories and experiences from Doctors 1-10, minus the specials. 2. Despite having all those experiences, memories, and feelings (all the factors involved in being 'made better', as 10 put it), he still committed genocide. He was supposed to be literally identical to 10 in every fashion, yet he was referred to by him as ""me, when we first met"". I think that's a little contradictory. He has all the experiences and memories from 10, but solves problems in a 9 fashion anyway? I think something is wrong there, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if he had an inherent evil buried within him. I don't buy the 'born in battle, thus inherently hardened' explanation. It was a meta-crisis that had *never happened before*. Why should The Doctor assume that it works the same as a standard regeneration?

The way he departs is an absolutely *perfect* scenario for him to start building a grudge against The Doctor as well, if you really think about it. If he's able to commit a genocide despite having all the experience and memories of 10, is it also safe to assume that there could be other things off with him too? For instance, him not actually loving Rose? Plus, shouldn't he be massively prone to having a 'who am I' style mental breakdown?

I'm rambling, and I don't think I wrote that out very eloquently. :P It's unlikely for any of it to happen anyway. Moffat seems very wary of using RTD era things beyond passing references, but it sure is fun to think about.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;Food is literally over abundant

Yes, but it isn't evenly geographically distributed, so it has to be traded for and moved around the world from places with more than enough food, to palces that cannot sustain themselves.

&gt;I'm on the way and I have only got a suburban plot. The summer months are easy, reclaiming skills and wisdom is a little bit harder.

If you manage total food independence, all power to you. Do let me know how much land it requires however, so I can do some napkin maths to see how much of the UK we'd need to cover in allotments to feed everyone.

&gt;Through the use of slash-n-burn, deforestation, and slave labour practices. Your cushy life is on the backs of deaths in places like Iraq, Libya, Zimbabwe and China.

And look how well Capitalism is changing that! For example, the cost of living in China is skyrocketing as they embrace the Capitalist model, as a result they demand more wages and better working conditions, and they'll get it, just as our ancestors did.

Similarly Capitalism *can* stop slash-and-burn deforestation. All we need is for people to care enough that they only buy from responsible sources, and then the market shifts to adapt, and only responsible, sustainable companies will be successful.

&gt; If that is truly the case then we are locked into a colonial system that will be enforced by military rule over the third world. However, it is choice. There are so many green spaces that could contribute to food security. You rule a people be denying them food. Yes, we are unfree in terms of environmental pre-requisites for life, but abstract politics and wilful denial of prosperity is something different entirely.

It [is the case, we currently only cover 60% of our food needs](http://www.ifr.ac.uk/waste/Reports/RuSource_foodsecurity.pdf). Yet this doesn't enforce colonialism. Capitalism is anti-colonialism (You need only look to The Wealth of Nations to find arguments against it). In fact, your proposal for individual self sufficiency and free food would *directly result* in Colonialism. If we no longer trade to get food in, we can not sustain our own population, therefore, we'd have to invade another country to gain more arable land that we can use for allotments and free food production. Unless of course, you advocate mass starvation or mass murder of our own population?

Capitalism means we can trade in a mutually beneficial way for that food - we give them money that they can trade for other things, they give us food. 

Additionally there are serious issues (highlighted in the link above) with seeking to be food self-sufficient. Try looking at North Korea as an example - a couple of bad harvests and millions of people die. Is that what you want?

&gt;It's only destructive if we leave the environment in a less fertile state for subsequent generations. Modern agriculture literally destroys and thins soils, and this is measurable, but there are alternatives that actually reverse the process, building soil and sequestering carbon out of the atmosphere whilst importantly lessening flooding.

I'm fully behind that, and it makes good economic sense - you don't want to destroy your resources.


I think you have noble aims, but I think that you fail to see that the Juche ideology you seem to be advocating won't achieve them. Instead it would result in mass starvation and misery. Instead of being ""slaves"" to 'the man', people would be ""slaves"" to the land. They'd live and die by it. Something that doesn't happen in our supposedly terrible capitalist society. What will achieve your aims is lobbying, and public awareness - if people shift their attitudes towards food, and shift their spending to match, then the market will issue the slap down to the unethical corporations.",0,1351191891,null,0,false,0,c6rokwm,t3_1222z1,t1_c6rokwm,t1_c6rmxrf,null,1430238062,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The rich worry about capital gains increases, stamp duty, their pensions, the state of the markets, and the direction of reform. Again, rightly so.

I don't know about that. They are different types of worry. As your income and assets increase, your worries become much more akin to first world problems.

The general result from lots of hours of discussion from some reasonably sensible folk is that one of the best things we have going here in the UK is our small islands, for the following reasons:

*Small rocky islands with vicious currents to stop Z walking up the shore, too slippy with seaweed and birdcrap for Z to climb up the rocks.

*Access to the sea makes communication/trade with other survivors possible in the long term, whilst minimising the chances predatory survivors could get to you. (Obviously if they had boats they could, but it still cuts out a big chunk of the predatory survivor population)

*Subsistence farming is possible, as was shown before the clearances, crofting is sustainable even without the benefit of electricity or petrol.

*The amount of wind and tidal power available makes electricity generation feasible.

*Diet can be supplemented with fish, which will grow more plentiful as the post-zombpocalyse world will consume less fish overall.

*There are a number of sites with reasonably intact Brochs, such as the [Broch of Mousa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broch_of_Mousa), which at a pinch would make solid refuges if a small number of zombies or predatory survivors managed to make it ashore.

We could make it easier for people to transition from welfare to work i.e. tapering down benefits instead of having a hard cut-off. We could improve adult education opportunities. We could increase minimum wage.

An effective and revenue neutral way would be to make it much easier to go from benefits to work and back to benefits again without jumping through the benefits hoops all over again.

That would allow people to apply for jobs or short term contracts, without the fear that if it didn't work out or came to an end then they would have all sorts of problems with their benefit claims.

Perhaps he doesn't fit with how we play typically but today was his best game back and looks to be regaining his passing efficiency.

To me the problem in the first half was about 80% Jermain Defoe. He was static and weak. He ran in circles inside the box and did absolutely nothing at all to open space for his teammates.

Second half JD starts working the channels and giving a shit and what a surprise we start to look far more dangerous. He needs to play like this 100% of the time to justify being in the team because in the first half we were indeed passive and it was largely because of him. 

I actually think Huddlestone's performance was one of the lone signs of encouragement from this match. He showed a lot more composure and accuracy under pressure. We really could have used a player slowing things down once we took the lead against Chelsea.

true,strolls,null,null,"I think it's a very *old fashioned* approach, but public schools nowadays teach to the syllabus (just like everyone else).

I was at a public school, around about 25 years ago now (!!), and was always useless at history, because it was just about memorising a bunch of names and dates, back then.

I think I was in the second or third year of pupils to go through GCSEs, after O-levels were scrapped, and this was when coursework was introduced.

I'll always remember this one exercise we did, the last year before I did my history GCSE, in which we looked at more-or-less contemporaneous accounts of some historical event, tried to sort out the biases (king's official scribe vs. some monk who lived a bit further away, so wouldn't have seen it first-hand) and tried to work out, as closely as we could, what actually happened. I remember this particular history teacher being pretty excited about this and saying how ""this is how teaching history is going"". 

I'm extremely dubious of this whole memorising-dates-by-rote approach to history, because I feel like it allows curriculum-setters to dictate a certain inflexible narrative. It's the sort of history my father (now in his 70s) studied - memorising that Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492 establishes a ""benevolent colonialism"" theme.

Bare memorised facts don't help us understand the impact on the indigenous tribes, and the student doesn't get any points for researching (or imagining) the diary of some obscure native and studying how he would be affected. 

I dunno, but it seems to me like the purpose of history is not to celebrate Nelson or Churchill, but to learn lessons from our mistakes of the past.

I swear this government must have got here by climbing out the pages of Dickens novel, because what I've read about how the Tories want to change about the history curriculum, it just seems like an attempt to imbue the uneducated classes in nationalistic pride.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"&gt; And look how well Capitalism is changing that! For example, the cost of living in China is skyrocketing as they embrace the Capitalist model, as a result they demand more wages and better working conditions, and they'll get it, just as our ancestors did.

I disagree here. It's impossible unless the abuse migrates else where like it did for US/EU heading east, my thoughts drift to Africa.

&gt; Capitalism is anti-colonialism

Nay, it is colonialism in disguise. Every ""free market"" had to be busted open: Iran, Iraq, Argentina, Chile, Philipines. It's about wealth extraction and imposition of approved currencies. First comes the bullet then comes the financial technocrat.

&gt; Capitalism means we can trade in a mutually beneficial way for that food

Capitalism means that those without the fictitious money are dictated to by those with, and inequality always leads to instability. It's a system that creates a class divide. It also means that the prosperity of the foreign nation is dependent on the home country not industrialising. The way the IMF loan systems tend to work is the poor country is only allowed to spend the money on primary industry, agro-mineral what have you, which is exported out of the country to ""value adding"" places like Germany and the UK. They are then locked into that model through debt.

&gt; Unless of course, you advocate mass starvation or mass murder of our own population?

Now that's a false dichotomy. If the UK hadn't have imported lots of unskilled labour in the 70s we'd be seeing the natural fall in population. The same has happened in Germany and Japan, but of course it's bad for GDP so that's a little secret governments don't like to admit (re: immigration is demanded in the quazi-ponzi scheme).

There are ~60 million acres of land in this country by the way, perhaps 2 useful arces per traditional family unit. Obviously I'd need to rule out mountainous regions, beaches, waterways and the like, but that figure is as far as I got. Don't forget though that much food is given over to rearing livestock (chickens/cattle), and much land is given over to sheep. Also a hell of a lot of space even in the suburban plot is given over to the carâroads, parking, garages, driveways, special pavement parking zones. My house has a driveway as long as the house so the car has more space devoted to it that I do (think 60s semi-bungalow).

&gt; Additionally there are serious issues (highlighted in the link above) with seeking to be food self-sufficient.

At some level there needs to be self sufficiency, everyone can't be a net importer. NK is impoverished because it fought a war and mis-spends money on military and it has terrible international relations so aid is reluctant. 1/7 in the US is on food stamps I believe.

&gt; but I think that you fail to see that the Juche ideology you seem to be advocating won't achieve them

I'm an anarchist not a Juche.

&gt; Instead it would result in mass starvation and misery. 

Yes, because should the UK throw out the factory owners and redistribute land America would arm the EDL and reinsert the monarchy. Being slaves to the land is all we can ever be as humans, it can only be an honest master and it will be around a lot longer than us.

&gt; Something that doesn't happen in our supposedly terrible capitalist society.

Meaning died though didn't it? Plus we have endless crises anyway (both real and imagined). We drilled a tunnel to France but we can't seem to find the political will or resources to provide safe environments to grow up in or free education. No one seems to care for the child prostitute in Rochdale for example or the 300'000 road traffic victims. Obesity is a looming threat, arthritic complaints from desk work is another issue, depression, and there has been a mass intellectual suicide in from of the TV.

&gt; What will achieve your aims is lobbying, and public awareness - if people shift their attitudes towards food, and shift their spending to match

No. It will take new economies based around local peerable currencies with a horticultural landscape fought for until a critical mass makes change inevitableâdistributed food supplies means that you can't have one pest that wipes out fields (think of that as an too-big-to-fail agriculture ending). Spending relies on what companies are willing to allow for sale (you can have anything aslong as it is black and Tescos stock it), so people will have to struggle out of the infancy that the welfare corporate outsourcing state fosters and do it for themselves.",0,1351194915,null,0,false,0,c6rpi3g,t3_1222z1,t1_c6rpi3g,t1_c6rokwm,null,1430238495,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Rainfall7711,lfc99,,"Ok so here's my small take/analysis of the first half.

Liverpool are lined up in a 4-2-1-3 formation if you like, with Shelvey pushed in front of Gerrard and Sahin who are sitting ahead of the back four. Wisdom is the withdrawn fullback on the right while on the Left Johnson has license to go forward. On the wings we have Downing and Assaidi, with Downing on the right broadly choosing to cut into the centre of the pitch, and Assaidi staying wide on the left. As usual Suarez is marauding around the penalty area.

Anzi are lined up in a 4-4-1-1 formation.

Liverpool have broadly controlled the whole game up to this point with more possession and chances. Anzi haven't had a shot on target so far.

To discuss the play, Liverpool have had most success down their left, with the combination of Assaidi(the game's best player up to now) and Johnson. Both of our shots at the goalkeeper have come from this side, and it's only a matter of time before we make the breakthrough if it continues.

Shelvey wasted a good chance after Suarez capitalised on a defense error, and that sums up our good opportunities in the first half.

On an individual basis Assaidi has been outstanding, with his direct penetrating runs, good awareness and link up play. Downing looks to be working a bit harder than usual but there aren't many more stand out performances right now.

On the other side, Suarez is having some particularly poor touches, and the midfield 3, while passing generally well, haven't been in the game.

Overall, a positive half for Liverpool, who are well set to record a win if the performance holds.

Students, as a rule, generally don't have a lot of spare money and certainly not enough to regularly pay the prices Leeds charge to attend a match. Lowering the prices for them will mean that they're filling seats that would have remained empty anyway, and there's even a chance that you'll convert fans who previously weren't interested in Leeds United or even football.

The biggest argument I can make for offering incentives to bring students into the ground is that many years ago Reading FC ran a similar scheme and a foreign student happened to take advantage of it and attend a game.

Yes.

And yes. Unemployment is also a stick used to beat the employed to legitimise pay cuts, or scare them into conforming. A by product of that is curbing ambition and legitimate entrepreneurship.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;I disagree here. It's impossible unless the abuse migrates else where like it did for US/EU heading east, my thoughts drift to Africa.

Consumerism is impossible, but once every country is industrialised, the market will adapt. Our lifestyles will change, but Capitalism will go on, because it works.

&gt;Nay, it is colonialism in disguise. Every ""free market"" had to be busted open: Iran, Iraq, Argentina, Chile, Philipines. It's about wealth extraction and imposition of approved currencies. First comes the bullet then comes the financial technocrat.

Now you're mixing politics and economics. Capitalism doesn't demand colonialism, or for markets to be busted open. Capitalism doesn't demand war, in fact, it discourages it through making us interdependent on trade. If war is unprofitable, then it becomes irrational. What's wrong is that war is profitible for a small segment of the population who have political power in the USA, therefore they make wars happen. That's a flaw of *democracy* and democratic systems, *not* a flaw of Capitalism.

&gt;At some level there needs to be self sufficiency, everyone can't be a net importer. NK is impoverished because it fought a war and mis-spends money on military and it has terrible international relations so aid is reluctant. 1/7 in the US is on food stamps I believe.

The world has to be food self-sufficient, but not at national level.

&gt;I'm an anarchist not a Juche.

Oh dear, that's even more hopeless. All of history has shown a tendency towards government and hierarchy. Anarchy cannot be achieved amongst human beings. Sure, you could get rid of government, but it'd take no time at all for a warlord to rise and subjugate people. This is our nature.

&gt;Yes, because should the UK throw out the factory owners and redistribute land America would arm the EDL and reinsert the monarchy. Being slaves to the land is all we can ever be as humans, it can only be an honest master and it will be around a lot longer than us.

Ultimately yes we are slaves to the land. But I choose not to work on the land, I choose to work in the office and use the fruits of my labour to pay for the literal fruits of another's labour. I can only have that choice under a system where labour is specialised, and the most successful system for this is Capitalism. Thus, in this system, I have a choice, whilst in yours I do not. You would impose slavery on me for your own intellectual goals.

&gt;Meaning died though didn't it? Plus we have endless crises anyway (both real and imagined). We drilled a tunnel to France but we can't seem to find the political will or resources to provide safe environments to grow up in or free education. No one seems to care for the child prostitute in Rochdale for example or the 300'000 road traffic victims. Obesity is a looming threat, arthritic complaints from desk work is another issue, depression, and there has been a mass intellectual suicide in from of the TV.

People die, accidents happen. Many less die than they would otherwise. History tells you this, over and over and over again. No feudal society living off the land has ever lived as well as we do now. Of course a fudal society isn't an anarchist society, but then... an anarchist society has never existed.

&gt;No. It will take new economies based around local peerable currencies with a horticultural landscape fought for until a critical mass makes change inevitableâdistributed food supplies means that you can't have one pest that wipes out fields (think of that as an too-big-to-fail agriculture ending). Spending relies on what companies are willing to allow for sale (you can have anything aslong as it is black and Tescos stock it), so people will have to struggle out of the infancy that the welfare corporate outsourcing state fosters and do it for themselves.

You can't have distributed food networks with local currencies, you have to trade outside your region to overcome local disasters in supply. Food has to be traded for widely to provide maximum food security, and for that you need established currencies and trade. In other words, we already *have* distributed food networks! When was the last time we faced famine in the UK? Your 'solution' is to a problem which doesn't exist for us. 

Also, again you seem to be missing the point of Capitalism. Companies sell what people want. If there is not enough demand, they don't sell it. That is the primary deciding factor in what is sold. If people want it and it can be supplied profitably, somebody will start selling it. This is how supply and demand works. Of course, that doesn't fit into the anarchist narrative does it?",0,1351196209,null,0,false,0,c6rpwpm,t3_1222z1,t1_c6rpwpm,t1_c6rpi3g,null,1430238749,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

""Boom Town"" is also a great episode and the monster in ""Aliens of London"" isn't exactly used the same way.

Also, skipping to series 5 won't seriously harm your viewing experience, you can always go back and watch the older ones later when you appreciate them more. (I first watched series 1 after 5 and the half of six that had aired - though I saw the beginning of 6 before 5 - and I found it extremely silly, but I watched it again a year later and could appreciate it more.

Has that been independently verified?  Obviously it goes some way towards game, set and match, albeit the very nature of the vulnerability of these children is that often no one specific is looking out for them and no one will report their disappearance if the bureaucracy doesn't maintain its records accurately.  Also, bear in mind that the allegations usually centred around the movement of children between different homes (I believe a home in Islington was often mentioned in relation to Jersey), and there have historically been large numbers of ""runaways"" and disappearances within the care system nationally.  Murders do happen without the discovery of bodies, sometimes without the discovery of trace evidence, however convictions are obviously much less likely.

I agree what evidence there is is patchy and questionable, mostly based around what seems to be a flawed initial investigation and multiple allegations arising from local and external experts and witnesses, including a number of former residents.  However, there's sufficient whiff of local corruption to make me less than happy until a rigorous and fully independent and transparent review of the case is carried out with substantial involvement from non-Jersey professionals.",0,1351198898,null,0,false,0,c6rqqte,t3_121qcs,t1_c6rqqte,t1_c6rjxfd,null,1430239149,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Football 101 suggests that playing with width is exactly the way to play against a team who are sitting so deep on their own 18-yard line, and there certainly wasn't any route through the centre tonight.  The biggest issue was that, having spread the ball and with Maribor quick to then push two men onto the wingers, we needed to hit a few early crosses.  ...but there's no target-man, no supporting midfielders running into the box, and the wingers we played tonight are not known for the accuracy of their early crosses.

Ok guys here it goes - a very good win for us but there are some worries still. I would like to compare our two leaders Gerrard and Suarez. 

**Gerrard** - minimum running and maximum efficiency. He didnt appear much but was always solid and made all the right moves on the field. He also conserved energy and made sure he isn't tired. 


**Suarez** - man he was frustrating to watch today. I lost count of his countless dives today and continuous bitching to teammates and ref. He needs to calm the fuck down and work hard not cry all the time. 

**Wisdom** - this kid will be a star if he can keep going like this. He was solid, made only one mistake and constantly proved that he isn't really a normal 19 year old. Second in line for MOTM for me

**Assaidi** - MOTM by far. He constantly ripped their D apart and Anzhi did not have an answer to him 

**Sahin** - solid as usual, bossed the mid in the first half and did some of our major defensive work covering for the other mid players in the second half

**Agger &amp; Skrtel** - the duo was solid as always. Skrtel in particular was strong and decisive. Agger is a clown for the goal :) 

**Jones** - another clutch performance by him. Reina should be a little worried with the way that Jones has been between the sticks. 

**Downing** - right foot? scored? the world must be coming to an end .. jokes aside he still has a lot to prove, but thank you for this win. 

**Jonjo** - could have scored a couple and could have done a little more in my books. The lad is still young and he is learning, but boy is he learning fast! The dark lord was solid as well in the mid and helped the D out when he had a chance. 

**Johnson** - very creative, some great passes and runs. Deserved a standing ovation for his first half. A great play by him, and I am glad he will be a little more rested for the derby



All and all we did well  until we scored a goal and then as per usual we sat back and did not try to play OUR game.

Assaidi killed it. Given how cheap he was and how he has impressed virtually every game he has played I'd say he was the best bargain we had over the summer.  MOTM for sure, with Skyrtel and Wisdom also deserving a lot of recognition.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Again, it's not that serious. Spending under Labour before the crash was quite reasonable, and lower than when they got in in 1997. Technically, there will always be a structural deficit or a structural surplus. If you chase the deficit you are removing money from the economy, money that will almost always be cheaper to pay off in the future. If you were to ever remove it, you'd have to either cut taxes and end up with a structural deficit again, or increase spending with the same effect. The alternative is to use the resulting surplus to pay off the national debt, which contrary to popular belief, would fucking trash the economy. You think your pensions are worthless now? Surpluses are exceptionally bad for any economy. You can look through the history of any large nation and you'll find that they are in surplus for perhaps half a year out of every ten.

But as I said before, the structural deficit is a small side issue at the moment. It really isn't important when the deficit created by the crash is so large. No amount of cutting is going to fix that deficit without growth.

true,DmcDT,,Belfast,"From experience, I know there are 2 preferred starting points.  The car park in Newcastle at the foot of Tollymore Forest Park will give you a bit of a walk, but will lead straight up the Mournes, along the Mourne Wall and up Slieve Donard I believe. Its been a few years since ive taken that particular route.

The route I favor is just beyond Newcastle, en route to Annalong. You stop at the Bloody Bridge carpark, and you make your way up the path through the landscape running parallel to the river. The main problem is, at this juncture, you have to wade across the river (often ankle high and not very fast moving) which lies at the foot of a steep enough drop. Be warned in bad weather this river can pick up flow dramatically. We where stuck here for a few hours until the rain died down until we felt it safe enough to cross (after being threatened by a farmer not to dare cross his land when we asked for a safe passage back to the cars). There is a lot of private land up this direction and they dont take kindly to travellers walking over their green.

Following this route up will lead you to the old quarry. You will often see the Mourne Runners favoring this route. You take this route straight up and it will lead you to the Mourne Wall, with the peak of Slieve Donard off to the right, and a few other mountains in every other direction.

At this time of the year, its not the cold I would warn you about. Its the fact you say you wont be taking a car. I know buses will leave you in Newcastle, but im not sure if one will take you to Bloody Bridge. Even at that, its getting dark very early, and the clocks will be moving next week. Its very easy for you to trip up there and seriously hurt yourself. The peak of Slieve Donard can be very exposed and there are a lot of areas around you can slip trip and fall. Im not sure what a conservative time is for somebody looking to walk. Normally when we go we set aside 3-5 hours for going up and down. Depending on how long you stop for photos, take in the scenery, and weather conditions.

It is an old Napoleonic star fort that has been turned into a museum. It has working tanks and hundreds of weapons from the past few centuries. Fort Widley is next to it, which is much the same, there is a military base nearby, which isn't shown on google maps, but it would have working guns. Both forts have enough grass to grow things. If that didn't work, Spitbank Fort is just off the coast - an old Napoleonic fort that has since been turned into a hotel.

In practice: no; innocent people can and do get convicted of things all the time, and murdering them would be a tragedy. Stupid people often respond to this critique with ""well we'll only use the death penalty when we're *absolutely* sure of guilt!"", with the meaning of ""conviction"" and the absurd consequences of having two levels of certainty of conviction going totally over their heads.

So I'm dead against having it as a mandatory sentence for a given crime, and apparently against having it as a ""at the judge's discretion"" option too.

Job Centre was massively unhelpful. I was constantly kept waiting at appointment times, they were at least 15 minutes late every time. I was 5 minutes late. Once. Because I was literally being sick on the journey in and they wouldn't let me sign on that week... Cue tons of paperwork to get that sorted and I lost Â£50. One of the women there actually complained, during our meeting, that she hated having to go to work. I was DESPERATE for a job! I was told I couldn't have help to start up a business until I had signed on for at least 6 months (I wasn't even asking for financial help! Just another source of info!) also they wanted me to volunteer which I did flat out refuse to do - I was trying to set up a business and they knew I didn't want to work for FREE (well for the Â£50 a week the job centre decided was enough for me to live on) when I could be working on making stock, or research, or business plans etc. But they were going to 'make me' volunteer after the 6 month mark. 

They told me off constantly for not having a driving licence but refused to help me financially to get one, but also expected me to apply for jobs that were 50/60 miles away (which they had found for me) expected me to be able to just move there, I had no money to pay bonds on flats and stuff! I ended up just signing off, didn't get a job but I was fed up of being told I wasn't doing enough or that my CV wasn't good enough or being expected to do things that were a financial impossibility but getting little advice or help. Also 50% of the staff seem to dismiss you right away as a looser thats signing on. But I guess its just one experience... they cant all belike that, can they?

I was told to take my degree off my CV too. That pissed me off.

In other words, if they'd cast someone other than Christian Bale as Batman because he's British and Batman is American, we'd be looking at very different, very probably inferior movies. I'd much rather keep quality over nationality. RDJ proved that an American can play a Brit as well as Brits can play Americans.
