true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"Suso's comment was a joke, yes. It was meant in jest, not in harm, but that doesn't mean it's OK. Jokes can be hurtful, and just because Jose Enrique doesn't care doesn't mean some people don't. If you're a gay fan, what are you supposed to think? Worse, if you're a closeted gay player who is thinking about coming out, what do you think?

It's not just opposing fans. We are quick to jump on a player who is underperforming and say he's shit. How would more socially conservative fans treat a gay player? What about coaches? How would your teammates feel about it in the locker room? These are not things that should be concerns, but gay players in team sports, especially male sports, is not normalized yet. Some players come from countries that do not accept gays. Hell, Cassano said just this summer that gays should stay closeted.

And there's no literal stoning, yes, but we know how horrible English tabloids can be. It's biased and unfair, and not every crime is punished equally. When someone like Wayne Rooney has an infidelity, or Ashley Cole has a sex tape, or even our own Stevie G gets into a fight at a club, those stories often don't end up as big as they maybe should be. Van Persie was accused of rape a few years ago, and I don't remember very much scrutiny from the press.

Compare those players to Justin Fashanu. After being outed, his career nosedived, because he lost his manager's respect, was forced to train with reserves, and lost his form due to a lack of game time. When he was accused of sexual assault, it set off a media panic and he ultimateld killed himself. Look at David Testo, a talented, proven midfielder in America's second division. His team was moved up to the MLS and his contract wasn't renewed. Maybe he wasn't good enough for MLS, but he certainly was god enough for any other second division side, but after he'd come out, not a single team offered him a contract and he was forced to retire at age 30 due to lack of options.

No, it's unlikely you're going to get killed in England, or Spain, or Germany for coming out, but to say there's no backlash, or no hazards, is incredibly naive. I don't like slippery slope arguments, but while there is a marked difference between exiling a gay player from his team and calling your friend gay on Twitter, there is still a link, and it fosters a dangerous and unwelcoming atmosphere for gay players.",0,1355878976,null,0,false,0,c7isvyv,t3_151x5n,t1_c7isvyv,t1_c7ir1es,null,1430712712,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,TheEmpiricist,null,null,"Thanks for replying with some well thought out discussion points!

Several of your points address autism and minor mental conditions, such as OCD. I'll go ahead and say it, I don't know enough about autism, or had the personal experience with it that you clearly have, so I don't feel like I can make a truly informed decision here. But I suspect you're right, I don't think people with autism have a significantly reduced quality of life, so in my hypothetical world, they wouldn't be encouraged to be aborted even if it could be reliably detected.

So, really, what I'm talking about are disorders which can be detected in utero, have effects which are judged to severely impact quality or length of life and are not currently treatable, or very difficult to treat. I'm mainly thinking of physical disabilities, though I'm sure theres a few mental ones that would meet my criteria. 

A good example might be cystic fibrosis, I know someone who suffers with that, she's having a terrible time of it, and if i could make it so that no one susceptible to that could be born, I would.

I'll address a couple of your numbered points now.

3. We're rapidly heading to a world where a genetic screening will be cheap enough to be part of a routine prenatal, it's already offered to at risk families

4. Due to the low overall rate of most serious disorders, I think the impact on demographics would be negligible

5. agreed, but that doesn't mean they're right - see vaccines.

6. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of forced abortions, I would want it to be at least strongly recommended, I suppose. But part of my mind can't shake the analogy with knowingly disabling a child. It's definitely a gray area for me.

7. To be brutally honest, an abortion is probably cheaper than a lifetime of care - not that I think cost is a valid reason for making such a decision! 
I don't know how much disabilities have helped science, outside of giving us a few clues to how genes work - but I don't think that's a justifiable people to perpetuate a segment of humanity in suffering.

Before the reign of Henry VIII, the Kingdom of England was a Catholic country. Kings reigned in the name of God, with the authority to reign bestowed by the Pope, who acted on behalf of God on Earth.

When Henry VIII decided that he no longer wanted to ask the Pope's permission to get divorced, he set up the Church of England, and installed himself as the head of this Church in 1534. Now the King reigned with authority bestowed directly by God. This was called the Divine Right of Kings.

Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688-89, the Hanover dynasty introduced reforms, including the Bill of Rights, which abandoned the theory of the Divine Right of Kings. In place of the Divine Right was the right of Parliament - and therefore legislators elected by the people - to determine the line of succession, and who would next be Monarch.

A recent example of Parliament's power to determines who can become Monarch was the [legal change that abolished male primogeniture](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15489544).

&gt;Bank balances are insured by governments...

Governments work for the people who are busy appropriating all the wealth for themselves. Countries are collapsing on your doorstep, fascism is on the rise. The UK is not adapting. This is lala thinking. 

&gt;Austerity is temporary and welfare cuts won't affect me personally since I don't rely on them.

Well fuck you. I don't depend on them either but I am concerned for those who do. You will need welfare, though, when the money you think you have for your old age has been gambled away or inflated to nothing. 

You can't be sure you'll be able to pay off your property loans. The government is corrupt.  

&gt;What do you actually expect to happen? You said a load of buzz words, but do you actually think we will descend into some sort of anarchy running around with gas masks on while the planet burns?

I used simple language because I don't want to write a fucking dissertation. Look around and learn. If you can't, wallow in your reality for as long as you can. 

Fewer people every day believe everything is going to sort itself out. The resources are disappearing. Capitalism won't collapse just like that but it will leave fewer and fewer people with the comforts eeryone in the West has become accustomed to. 

Wait and see.

But there were too many examples to count.  Of course, defendants lie all the time too, I'm not being naive about it, but there were numerous instances where they had nothing to gain from it, and/or the evidence supported their version of events.  I've said before, one thing which happened umpteen times was that a seized amount of drugs ""shrank"" between the taking of instructions and the court case.  Not something a defendant has any reason to contradict, so a nice little earner one assumes (sure, some probably just ""went missing"", but not all of it).  

Then there were endless arguments about who said what when, and for sure, many of these were undoubtedly defendants bullshitting or just reasonable different memories of what was said.  But again, not all of them, and the problem, particularly when it's something crucial, is that the professional witnesses give evidence confidently, from notes recorded shortly after the event (at least, they say so), and are almost always believed by juries whether or not this is justified.  Because the police don't lie, right?  Defendants' friends and family can give evidence as witnesses, but their evidence is generally viewed sceptically - mates back up mates don't they? And your mum or other half, they'd perjure themselves to cover for you, wouldn't they?  But police officers?  It's heresy to suggest they might chat about ""what they saw"" and ""how it went own"", write up their notes collaboratively in the canteen, back each other up when one goes a bit far, or embroider evidence to pin something on a ""wrong 'un"".

In terms of the protests, what do you expect them to do? Sit quietly in their houses, hoping that you will all just go away, and then quietly try and pick up the smashed WKD bottles and detritus left all over Belfast before you come back again the other way?

1) Relax (I did this about 1/4 of the way round the test route when I made a minor mistake and figured I'd failed, the relaxed drive became a breeze if a pass because I'd taken the mental pressure off)

2) Make a point of exaggerating your mirror checks. If you think the examiner hasn't seen your mirror check (and you've got safe time to) do another.

3) Don't be intimidated by the examiner. Remain courteous but try and picture him in your mind as a peer. It takes the pressure off and will give you the confidence.

You know what you're doing, just get on with it and show the examiner you can, you'll have the pink licence in no time.

Once you've passed feel free to PM me for proper driving tips to stay safe, I'm an advanced, response and pursuit driver so may have some handy hints for after you've passed... It becomes a different ball game then.

It's lost the sense of scale that the new series console has.  Still, this is Doctor Who, things always change and that keeps it fresh.  I suppose I'll get used to it.

Though I reallyyy liked *Lungbarrow*'s origin story and I didn't feel like it ruined the mystery of the character.

In a way, it's great to keep things changing and make it go into any story, but I think we really do need to not be afraid to develop the Doctor's character. Like the Time War. Huge change, and for the better. Or, if we said that the 7th Doctor is asexual and the 11th Doctor is bisexual. I mean, it's not like us humans stick with one sexuality forever.

Striker is the position we really need to be focussing on..hope we get somebody like Shane Long...a striker who isn't afraid to get stuck in there with the boys, and then by next season, we would have Lukaku back as well.

If anything I think we need more of a change in playing style rather than a change in personnel. Watch how BvB play. More than half of their team aren't 'stars' yet they play amazing sexy football. Closer to England, and we have Swansea that play like that. A good team outshines any good transfers. We already have a very solid team to play slick football, now its just finding the right tweaks to make it happen. Buying new players isn't going to solve this problem anymore.

It's supposition, but then I don't profess any differently and it seems more logical than any big coverup.

That was the primary reason why he left us in the first place, so I suppose he'll be on the bench more often than not. I don't think Assaidi is starting eleven material at the moment. He could be, in the future, but as an impact sub I think he'll do really well, with his fresh legs against the tired defender's.

If Sturridge does come, I think he'll be starting first, at least for a while. Borini still needs to adapt to the Premier League, and is still young (albeit only younger by Sturridge by 2 years). But Borini starting works as well I guess, if he can tire defenders for Sturridge to come on it'll be good.

Here's my take on it:

XI: Reina, Johnson, Skrtel, Agger, Enriqe, Lucas, Allen, Gerrard, Sterling, Sturridge, Suarez

Bench: Jones, Kelly (Wisdom), Coates, Henderson (Coady), Shelvey (Sahin/Suso), Assaidi (Ince), Borini

Brackets are to identify possible replacements in the bench.

Substitutions would ideally be: Borini -&gt; Sturridge (?)

----------------------------: Assaidi -&gt; Sterling

Assaidi's also shown nothing significant to suggest he should start regularly. He's fun to watch, but still lacks end product, and would probably lose to Sterling in a fight. Also, Ince isn't signing for the reserves; he's left-footed, so he'll likely be a direct back-up to Sturridge for the right wing.

• Buy Falcao.

• Sell Sturridge OR Torres (one will leave, the other will stay as a backup)

• If we sell both, we'll buy another backup (Schurle, Dzeko...)

**Midfield**

• Midfield is beefed up like nobody's business. We don't need anyone, and if anything gets serious we can recall someone back.

• I've written about Lampard below with AC

**Defense**

• I'd *like* to see AC get his contract renewed but I can't see it happening. I think Frank is a definite no to a contract renewal, even for one year. They're going for a young team and just letting them go. Legendary status clearly means nothing, see Drogba.

• The really bad news is that this means Terry will probably only be at Chelsea until the end of his current contract (about another year and a half) Treasure the time you have with him now. Love him.

**Goalkeeper**

• Courtois isn't going anywhere. Cech will last until the end of his current contract (2016) at the *latest* but could go before that. Courtois by then will have had another year at Athletico, and will then come over to the PL for a couple of years before joining us

No trolling.

Take an extreme example, just to illustrate my point.

If you knew that a baby would be born with a condition so horrible that they would be in constant agony until the moment they died, would it be moral to not abort them?

Surely it shouldn't be only up to the mother, but we should consider the quality of the life that the baby would have.  If the quality of life is not sufficiently high, then we have a moral obligation to abort.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Free speech is just some weird illusion that we've constructed to help us pretend there is democracy. I don't really believe in human rights, just sets of things that can happen or do happen.

Regarding this issue there are two semantic hurdles: what is ""free"" and what is ""speech""? Freedom has become an arbitrary construct, certainly in application, and it is particularly muddy when we think about freedom from X or Y. ""The ability to act without persecution"" seems the established meaning, however, I think an originally in was the ability to make meaningful relationships with others which relates to the idea of self determination that underpins democracy. If we think of the antithesis of freedom, which is slavery, the negative definition seems obvious: slaves cannot have meaningful participation in politics, commerce, or even their daily habits. Presumably even reproduction and the sex life of slaves were controlled by the master—that is true for prisoners today.

As for speech, what is included? Utterances? Tweets? Text? Hieroglyphics? Sign language? Body language? Braille? The only unifying feature is information with semantic weight—we may not even need the latter part of that definition. I can only ever conclude that illegal information is a bizzarre concept. If we were to universalise the treatment of tweeters then all bibles would have to be illegal also.

I'm going to cop out perhaps, and say we don't need to criminalise any speech because this misses a problem upstream. First, people have had to become filled with hate to commit ""hate speech"" ~~in the first place~~. That seems to be a social rather than a criminal problem, and I think we can find a resolution without having to rely on punishment, certainly not prison time.",0,1355905127,null,0,1355911362,0,c7iz2ag,t3_153gec,t1_c7iz2ag,t3_153gec,null,1430715715,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Regarding mirror use, make sure that your head moves slightly when you look in the mirror. Don't pay attention to anyone who says that you should adjust your mirror so that it is pointing the wrong way, you don't need to be leaning halfway across the car to look behind you.

As an example, why bring someone into the world who will be in constant incurable pain for their entire life?

I'm sure you can see that if we lived in an age where you could prevent that within minutes of conception or even beforehand, you'd find that if someone purposefully wanted to have such a child there would be a massive public outcry against it.

&gt;Monckton has since stated ""the article was written at the very outset of the AIDS epidemic, and with 33 million people around the world now infected, the possibility of [quarantine] is laughable. It couldn't work."" __He also said that this standard protocol could have worked at the time; that senior HIV investigators had called for it; and that many of the lives that have been lost could have been saved.__

So although he no longer calls for a quarantine, he still believes it was the correct thing to do at the time he called for it, and now blames the fact that he was ignored as the reason why the quarantine would no longer be successful. 

In other words, he _still_ doesn't realise just how detestable an idea it was especially given the complete lack of knowledge of the disease and correct identification of carriers (at the start it was known as Gay-Related Immune Deficiency before it became  apparent that it could be just as prevalent in heterosexuals).

&gt;“With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.

&gt;The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, if so urged by hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with a certain and great present evil. Hence we must bear without complaining the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely the weaker and inferior members of society not marrying so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased, though this is more to be hoped for than expected, by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage.”

The quintessential British treat is the biscuit.  Taken in vast quantities with the national drink tea, they are an absolute staple of british food.

Our biscuit industry is worth over £1bn annually and while may of the companies are multi nationals there are may fine independent  producers making world class products.

Many products are made using high quality locally sourced ingredients to a very high standard.  If you are in the US check out Amazon for some great treats.   You should be able to find the likes of Borders biscuits and Walkers shortbread there.

4) That is the solution. My father uses a SIPP (self invested Pension?) and has promised to teach me all about it over a nice lunch at some point in the next few months. I'm looking forward to it! Especially as he did that after his (standard life?) scheme collapsed and lost his pension.


5) I'm not speculating on the housing market. We bought a house within our means with a good deposit at affordable repayments. It's got an extra bedroom for us to grow into and I fully expect to live there for the next 10-15 years. You need to live SOMEWHERE, best to be paying a mortgage than rent considering how high rents are. We were spending 40% of our income living in a flat in London, now it's closer to 20%.

I don't think it's fair or even right to dismiss a good portion of spin off media as ""catering to fan service and *that particular demograph*"" (you and I both know the people we're referring to here)  I would remind you that the spin off media and endless re-runs on UK gold and PBS are very probably what got the '05 show picked up *in the first place* - to dismiss them as canon, especially when someone has pointed out that there have been some exceptional examples of creative writing within the pages is completely unfair to say the least, and even then, you have to consider that a good portion of those stories are mined for ideas for the new series, that originated on page (Family of Blood &amp; Human Nature is an excellent example of this)

Detrimental? I think not. I think while it's completely ok to leave some mystery, paying fan service to the new series is entirely inappropriate; for example, we have the RTD era telling us apparently that it's perfectly ok for a 900 year old gallifreyan to pursue a romantic relationship with a 21 year old woman, and then to go on for another three series and ruin it for us completely *by constantly moping over her* -The nu who series has had some terrible, *terrible storytelling as well (anything RTD has written comes to mind, and I haven't been especially thrilled with the Mark Gatiss contributions, *Fear her*,*the idiot's lantern* and pretty much any thought he's had on the river song story thread come to mind especially)

Don't get me wrong...I completely get the need to get new people interested in the show - it's precisely why the same kind of re-vamp is happening, but I think it's unfair to fans that have kept the show alive, and not to mention the authors and artists that have created a body of work in the form of the books and big finish productions, to simply dismiss them and say that they aren't canon. They *are* canon, for precisely the purpose that they are officially licenced by auntie; now I grant you, there are times when the efforts of the authors could have done with a little bit of quality control, but the same can be said of both the Moffat and RTD era.

**Nothing comes close.**

I remember the years before watching and getting my hopes up only to see Liverpool to crash out, to be fair we got a lot further every year then people pegged us to but it was always so close yet so far.. 

I remember reading in the papers after we made it through to the knock-out stages, word for word; 

'*It's a miracle this Liverpool squad have made it this far, they are the dark horse, the underdogs, they haven't got the experience or the playing power to go on and win it.*' 

I remember reading this and feeling angry, at the time Liverpool to me was the best club in the world and I couldn't believe that people were writing us off, but looking back now they were right too we were out of our league. 

Again and again we overcame the odds, game after game, out of nowhere goals, fighting to the death defending, players picking up knocks but carrying on because we needed to see the half out all above and beyond stuff. 

Then when we won in the Semi's I was so excited, a lot of people had been talking shit about Liverpool the entire tournament and it didn't stop, people had already written us out of winning it. No chance they gave us and why should they at the time AC Milan were the top team around, at the time Paolo Maldini had now won it 4 times and was arguably worth more than the team combined.

But the final game came we went behind, but it was weird even thinking back today I never really gave up hope like I would in other games, we came to far to go out and we fought back and won it.

People seem to think Gordon Brown was some sort of bumbling idiot. **He sold the gold cheaply on purpose.** Maybe he knew what was coming, maybe he didn't. All he did was buy the global economy more time at the British taxpayers expense. US banks were struggling to meet their obligations (HELLO: BIG FUCKING WARNING ALARM GOING OFF) so he decided to help them out. How nice.

Between 1999-2002, in the years before the financial crash of 2007/08, Gordon Brown helped US banks meet their obligations by causing a gold price crash. 

He did this by:

- Announcing a huge sale of British gold in advance (alerting the market to a massive incoming increase in supply, causing a price crash)

- Used the auction system to sell the gold which was known to push the price even lower

Key quote from the Telegraph article:

*Faced with the prospect of a global collapse in the banking system, the Chancellor took the decision to bail out the banks by dumping Britain’s gold, forcing the price down and allowing the banks to buy back gold at a profit, thus meeting their borrowing obligations.*

The night buses are a bit more expensive (£3? but it's like a day pass in that it's unlimited changeovers) but are good for getting home very late or getting to the airport very early (it's the cheapest way to get to the airport if you don't mind it taking a bit longer)

If you want to explore the city a bit it might be a good idea for you and your fiancé to get a couple of day passes, and a map, and just travel around the city.

Flat prices are pretty reasonable around Dalkeith Road and other places about that far south, but there are places you probably want to avoid, like Craigmillar, and Sighthill.

Yes the onus of proof would be on her, however required proof for rape I believe is much lower (due to the difficulty and sensitivity of the cases).

His defence was far too strong and she had little evidence herself, certainly nothing incriminating like DNA evidence and defence wounds. Character references were included which was both a good and bad thing in my opinion (just because x is normally a slut, it doesn't mean she wasn't genuinely raped for instance) but it was still reiterated to the jury that there must be no reasonable doubt of his guilt for a guilty charge to be brought. Sad that still broke up their relationship but that's life.

Rape by deception etc is a controversial charge, and a relatively new one. What if a man and woman get divorced and she takes him to court with ""I only slept with him because he said we would be together forever"" Rape is already difficult to prove, certainly if some time has passed but verbal contracts are virtually impossible.

This is probably not the greatest example but in sign language, there are a lot of things missing compared to spoken or written English. Creating a different sign for every tense of a verb would become very hard to memorize and using signs for articles would clutter the language because you're going to be able to speak faster than someone can sign intelligibly if they try and directly translate every word. As a result, a direct translation of signing is going to seem like broken English. The idea is that through context you can piece it into a more complete thought.

I get they can't ID every one but as some one who's done promotion over the years and worked gigs having under-age kids at over 18 shows is a paaaaaaaaaaaain on so many levels. It's a lot better than it used to be but during my late teens, early 20s, there were some clubs and such where you took nothing for granted. In a perfect world you should really be able to presume that people in an over 18 event who want to have sex with you are perfectly able to decide do so... well... depending on how drunk they are but that's a whole other fucking awful mess to get in to.

I'm not sure it's so much power corrupting as people not thinking. You can't account for everything but as a musician who is actually dealing with groupies you should be well aware of the dangers. For example I know some one who had a bunch of young, under-age groupies who kept throwing them self's at him. Some of them look and acted older than they where and they where really not that much younger than him at the time so that made him worried that he might slip up. Young horny guy having what I'm fine in saying where very attractive girls actively trying to get him to fuck them? It would be a lot easier than you'd think to tell your self they knew what they where doing and it would be ok.

So he made sure he was never put in a situation in which he was alone with any of those girls (hard work sometimes as it turned out) buuuuut in turn it would be unfair to expect him to also ID every girl who wanted to sleep with him after an over 18's show. He was a young guy but very aware that he had a responsibility to those girls but I can imagine that some who simply didn't think about that might have put them self's in a place where they did slip up. Not an excuse really but there's a difference between that and actively using your power to go after under age girls.

That said there where always rumours about some people who actively encouraged the younger aged groupies and if you are the kind of person who is like that being in a band is a very powerful thing. The girls clearly are not doing things against their will but they are very young (so young the law says they can't really know their own mind) and incredibly easy to manipulate if you are some one they idolise.

You have the maths to back that up? The Royal Family (since George III anyway) gives all its money from its lands and such to Parliament, and Parliament gives it a yearly wage. If we dethroned the royals, it would still be their land, thus the country loses a large chunk of money. Unless you advocate stealing it from them or killing them all, but hey.

Oh, and people do come here to see them. The tourism surrounding the Royal Family is huge.

7. Marin

8. Mikel (Going to AFCON - Maximum from mid-Jan to Feb 10th)

Players who can play and have played in midfield:

15. David Luiz

16. Bertrand

17. Piazon

18. Chalobah (loan)


We already have 7 midfielders who comfortably play there and aren't injured, on loan or playing in AFCON. Including Mikel, who is away for a *maximum* of one month from Mid-Jan to Feb 10th, that list is 8. We then have another 5 players on loan who we can recall if needs be, 3 (+1 loan) players who can and have played in midfield, and Romeu who is injured. If you feel that those players will be going away in the summer (Lamps, McEachran, Kakuta, Benayoun) then we can buy a new player then, but January transfers are notoriously more expensive - considering we just got knocked out of the CL, it's not money we can afford given FFP and the need for a striker.

Next season is an entirely different argument, as Lampard and Benayoun will almost definitely be going and Essien's future is questionable.

Might be a bit of a silly example, but there are times in history where it was normal for a child to be put to bed in a freezing cold room with no heating and with barely any food to eat - it was normal and acceptable because that was the best people could do. Today it's neglect and child abuse and all that stuff because we have good heating technology and social welfare. The only reason not having these things is abuse is because they exist. If they didn't then the exact same situation would be fine!

The point though is that if you lived in that time you'd be thinking ""wow, how can anyone possibly take my child away from me just because the harvest was bad and it's a cold winter"" - it would seem out of the world, complete un-relateable madness. Yet here we are in that mad world.

Do you really think it could never become illegal to purposefully create a child who will suffer their entire life in some way when we have the technology to completely prevent all such suffering?

What if someone wanted to take thalidomide right now to purposefully have a deformed child? Would you support their right to do that? It's not many steps away, you're still making a choice to have a disabled child, only on one hand you're just not taking any preventative measures, and on the other hand you're actively causing it.

Ah well, you can disagree if you like but if we both live another 500 years I'll bet you £10,000,000 (bloody inflation!) that I end up being right :P

This is because all age gigs are much harder to licence booze wise and booze is where the money is for a lot of venues. At the 14+ gigs I've worked promotion wise we often couldn't let under 18s leave and re-enter the venue because of the 14+ licence. The masque/barfly (depending on the time) often tended to have to get those licences specially for the event at some points rather than having a blanket 14+ licence. 

But at the major national level that lostprohest where? sure... but my point was more that talking about ""border line cases"" misses the fact a lot of under-age girls look very clearly over 18. Should people in big bands be careful?

I'd disagree to the claim there aren't any underlying principles when it comes to morality, but of course one moral universe may be more legitimate than another. That said morality becomes the intangible expression of the unmeasurable relationships between wilful actors, but no set of laws are going to be able to cover every context. (I'm looking forward to the vampiric sentient humanoids and the moral conflict over the right to drink blood.)

&gt; weird

I would say they are very specific, even the ""weird"" ones, which goes back to the idea of an underlying set of principles. The niqab had roots in the protection of daughters from the sex trade for example.

Well, yes, it only exists if you can imagine it—""there is no spoon, Neo"". The same can be said of the hand which is a decontextualised pattern that doesn't make sense without the rest of what is.

true,Mordecai3FingerBrown,,Belfast,"So they've only had a problem with it for the last 30 odd years? Sure that's no time at all why don't we just forget about it. 

If you think that is all the marchers are doing then you have never been to one, the whole process isn't about celebrating your culture its about denigrating someone else's, about waving a big two fingers to the world, and about bringing the whole province to a halt because you can. It's a festival of bullying, epitomised by the so called ""blood and thunder"" bands.

Which brings me to my next point, the overiding essence of Britishness in the 21st Century is tolerance for others. We have some of the most liberal laws in the world and we have a multicultural, multifaith community who rub along together without too many problems. British culture is a living, breathing thing, it changes almost weekly, it is improved upon, revised, added to. Unionism/Loyalism is all about intolerance, its about maintaining the status quo, its about looking back instead of forward. Your culture doesn't create anything of value, any new song is a hate filled anti Nationalist war cry. You are like the embarrassing side of the family that British people don't talk about, only even more sinister because you're a violent drunk who throws his toys out the pram at the drop of a hat, or a flag.

Basically my point is that just because Unionists consider themselves more British than anyone else doesn't make it so. You have atrophied from British culture, your Britishness bears no resemblance to Britishness anywhere else so therefore it is not Britishness or certainly not Modern Britishness. Call it your culture, celebrate it, but don't confuse it with British culture. ",0,1355931686,null,0,false,0,c7j2twx,t3_150881,t1_c7j2twx,t1_c7j0igg,null,1430717704,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5

Once that has completed the same Irish lady has said that she'll call me back to sort out the infinity order and ensure I'm still getting all the relevant discounts as if id ordered online as a new customer.

Coentrao in- AC is gone. I feel like its inevitable now and it really brings tears to my eyes. Bertrand isn't ready yet. He has shown flashes of brilliance but we need someone solid there and that is what Coentrao provides.

Lampard out-This kills me to say but I think its time for super Frank to start the next chapter of his playing career. Frank is the reason I fell in love with Chelsea and he is my favorite all time player but the club needs to come first and we need to make room for our prospects.

KDB recalled-Bring him back to take Frank's spot. He has been utterly brilliant for Werder Bremen and could bring a missing element to our squad. I truly believe KDB could be the catalyst we need to turn this season around. 

Striker in-Torres needs to get used to those nice bucket seats on the sidelines. Its time we bring in someone to replace him. I think Lukaku can be world class in the future so I preferably would love a striker who will be tapering off as Lukaku is coming into his prime. Falcao, Dzeko, Higuain would be great replacements. My biggest concern here is buying too young. Don't buy another up and coming striker. Buy a 25+ proven striker until Lukaku is ready to take over first team responsibilities.

We seem to have reached the stage where most people will agree FGM is abhorrent - and the national media often has stories about it - but MGM isn't really spoken about. This has changed in the last year or so, following san Francisco and Germany, but things don't really seem to be changing in the national mindset.

I'm not sure how we can get beyond it or make people more aware, without sometimes appearing to say ""Yes but what about men?"" - I should be clear I'm *not* trying to do that now, rather muse on the subject. Also it seems that quite often male circumcision can be dismissed with the reverse of the attitude sp8der is being slapped for here: ""Pish, FGM is *much* more serious."" Spot check on the street, if you will, and your average person won't realise that anything 'bad' is associated with MGM, not even the loss of sensitivity that is must occur due to simple physiology.

I often ask people, when they say something about FGM, ""How many different types of FGM are there?"" While I agree with you - no-one should be interfered with - it seems that many people don't realize that some forms of FGM are objectively less serious than MGM.

As much as I hate to say it, but I love watching the way Man United play...it looks so slick and quick...and they have an amazing balance between keeping the ball and getting it up the pitch with ease. Which contrasts alot from Swansea with how they tend to like to keep posession and wait patiently for runs. 

I think we are a little bit lacking in that area though...that 'forward run'. We rely on our holy trinity to do that, and to great effect they do it.

_______________________________________

(I'm still trying to form this argument/point correctly, so bear with me if I don't get it quite right. Also I should make it clear that I'm not arguing for people to be put away for their opinion, and I dislike the term ""offence/offended"" very much - it's very unhelpful.)

There is a slight issue with the ""everything else - legal"" part though, and it ties into social attitudes I think.

Consider 40 years ago, someone putting a sign up in the window of their B&amp;B: ""No blacks, no dogs, no Irish."" This is, of course, slightly different to a 'freedom of speech' argument as such signs were intended to make it clear that various groups/people were not welcome and would be turned away. But I wonder how much of an influence various legislations had against things like racist thought and feeling, by curbing those who might otherwise have said what they wanted.

Thinking about it, it seems that it's a 'choice between two evils'. If we consider racism for a second, we seem to have two simple choices:

1. Allow people to say as they wish, then deal with the fallout in whatever way. That method results in a historically (and currently to a varying degree) persecuted people to be insulted or abused due to the colour of their skin. Or:
2. Stop people from saying certain things under threat of legal action. That method results in (fringe?) opinions being stifled in public, particularly when presented in a certain way, but means that non-white people (mainly) are not subject to abuse without consequence and do not have their equal social standing undermined.

(I am open to have those two options critiqued).

I realize that the issue extends beyond racism, of course. But always, when these sorts of things are discussed, I wonder as to whether or not those who advocate freedom of speech at all costs (save 'fighting words' or slander or libel (people tend to forget them, particularly Americans!)) are coming from a group who are the subject of harsh words or 'abuse' on a regular basis. There will be people who don't think that way, but I doubt that there are comparatively many black people who would be 'OK' with receiving racist abuse and say ""Fair dos- freedom of speech."" That's not to say they are therefore allowed to be protected from it, but I think it's worth considering.

Further to this, consider something that cropped up (again) some months ago now on r/uk: a possible new law to deal with unwanted sexual remarks and more. [Link to thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/zlhex/sexist_remarks_and_wolfwhistles_could_become/) (Note - the headline isn't quite correct.) As I said to someone at the time, who seemed a little upset about the possible limits to 'his' freedom:

&gt; [If you'll excuse some musing on my part, I'm going to guess that you're male? Let me be clear that I'm not dismissing your opinions just because of that (hell, I'm a man too) or at all (I understand where you're coming from, even if I don't agree) but I have to wonder just how many people who might get annoyed, worried or shirty about legislation like this are female. Not many, I warrant (I could do a survey but I think it's a fair assumption), and I think that if that is the case then it's rather telling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/zlhex/sexist_remarks_and_wolfwhistles_could_become/c65pivz)

And I should acknowledge that laws that use the term ""offence"" aren't very helpful at all. And I am 100% behind [reforming Section 5](http://reformsection5.org.uk/).

true,Noelthemexican,logo,,"I agree, Isco seems to be a fans favorite for a transfer. But if we wanted any other creative wide midfielders, we could always consider: 

* Alan Dzygoev from CSKA Moscow. Russian. He plays out in a wide midfield role, and pushes up well. He makes many great passes for Doumbia and Honda, and has proved to be a good play maker. Hasn't been fully locked down in Moscow, so I think that we could get him.

* Oussama Assaidi from Liverpool. Moroccan. He's young, But personally I think he has the potential to become a decent player. He plays as a winger and has a very creative mind. If his technical skills could be improved (Passing, Shooting), He could be a very dangerous player on the wing. But, I could definitely imagining him turn into another Sinclair. He'd be fairly cheap I believe, because Brendan Rodgers does not seem to favor him in a starting role. 

* Jakub Błaszczykowski from Borussia Dortmund. Polish. 27 years old, Jakub is the captain for the Polish national team, he shows great technical and mental abilities, he plays a little farther back than a winger, but definitely sends glorious through balls from that position. Being in his prime at 27 years old, could be a great player for the next 4-5 seasons. Though, being the captain of Poland and starting for Borussia Dortmund would definitely constitute a higher cost.

* Arda Turan from Atletico Madrid. Turkish. Still has a good amount of years on him at 25 years old, Turan can play well on both the wing and the in the middle. His technical abilities are good, has good passing, a good solid cross, and can cut in for a shot once in a while. He distributes well to the strikers by giving the balls straight to them, or into space, but can also keep possession well, with quick one touch passes. He's only been at Atletico Madrid for about 2 years so he might be a little expensive, but now that Atletico is trying out different ways to give the ball to Falcao, he may become unnecessary, though that is unlikely. It is likely that we would have to pay a decent amount for him.

* Adel Taarabt from QPR. Moroccan. He's quite young, at 23 years old. He has a very creative mind, and plays well on the wings. He likes to cut in a lot, but is still a creative player. Some of the drawbacks would be how hard it is to get him. While he is quite skillful he just had a contract extension with QPR which would keep his price much higher. Also, he is practically carrying QPR as much as he can right now, and QPR would probably not want to get rid of him, also some of his rumored interest in Manchester United may be a set back. But if QPR were to get relegated, he'd be much easier to pick up.

* James Rodriguez from F.C Porto. Colombian. Very young at age 21, and has proved to be an integral part to Porto. Plays a winger and creates many goals as he scores them. With these kind of performances at this age, one can only hope that he grows into something amazing. But him becoming an integral part of Porto can drive the price up. But, he may be worth it, because in my opinion, Rodriguez is twice the player Sinclair is. Not that Sinclair is bad, just that James Rodriguez is good.

*Unrealistic*

* Giovanni dos Santos from Real Mallorca. Mexican. Still young, has amazing ball control and creativity. His creativity though does not always come to fruition. Just signed for Real Mallorca so it'd be hard to sign him in January.

* Andrey Arshavin from Arsenal. Russian. Aging, but still useful at the age of 31, creative and great technical skills, underated by many. With his contract ending soon, and Arsenal wanting to cash out on him, would be quite cheap. Good all around player and very unselfish.

* Pascal Millien from Sligo Rovers. Haitian. In his prime, 26, could be a real deal. New to Europe, Pascal has great ball control and skill, and prefers the wing. Crosses are almost always perfect, dribbles very well, and has great ideas for his passes and most make it through. He is also very fast. He'd be very cheap because of his obscure reputation and also which leauge he plays in. I actually think this would be the best purchase financially. We'd get a good player for a low price.

* Zakaria Labyad from Sporting CP. Moroccan. Young at 19, he has some potential but, has not yet proven himself, though he is definitely one to consider, runs a good speed, passes a good pass, a gives a good shot. A very well rounded player, except his dribbling stands out as superior.

* Neymar from Santos. Brazil. I don't think I have to explain him, but I suspect he would have the same effect that Ronaldo did in the premier league. Would be very expensive though.

* Alex Oxlade-Chamerlain from Arsenal. English. Great ball control for his young age of 19, and has the speed to match it. Great technical skills, though hasn't seemed to get in on the mental aspect of the game, though he is a player Arsenal is attempting to hold onto, so it would be tough to tear him away, though he'd be great for the Home-grown rule.

* Eden Hazard from Chelsea. Belgian. No need to explain. New to Chelsea. Great player, so that mean ridiculously high price. Love to have him later, but too much cost on him right now.

frankly, a team should hypothetically never delve into the january transfer market unless you really fuckin need it because prices are inflated (torres 50 carroll 35). i'd rather recall for any positions we need and make a more level headed purchase in the summer. we have all the possible youngsters we could need to cover any position through out the pitch. there is no real need to drop 80m on falcao or anything ridiculous like that even though they're just numbers to RA.

but honestly. we have a squad right now that could challenge for any competition we are in. technically we really just need top 4 (obviously other silverware would be preferred). all we need to do well for the rest of the season is some replacements to give rest to our first team players (KDB + essien), and lukaku to give us another attacking option given sturridge is out the door. we're not in as bad of shape as everyone makes out.",0,1355940730,null,0,false,0,c7j5dtp,t3_153091,t1_c7j5dtp,t3_153091,null,1430718813,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Noelthemexican,logo,,"There's not a lot of people who can play like Yaya Toure and there is no way that we would find many at the same quality, the ones who do stand out though:

* Marouane Fellaini from Everton. Belgian. Fellain still has plenty of years with him, at age 25, Fellaini has proven to be a very effective force going forward and staying back. He has a similar play style to Yaya, uses his strength and size to run down the field. He is also quite effective with his head in addition to being a good shot and passer. Does great as a holding mid, and with his antics and his rumored exit in January it would be a good price.

* Roman Shirokov from Zenit. Russian. This is another man who I think has a similar play style to Yaya, uses his strength to get forward, but can also win the ball in midfield. Though at age 31, he probably only has 3 years left on him. Though with his attitude, he may not become one of the favored figures, as he is not at Zenit. He'd be cheaper though, due to the fans disfavor for him. 

*Other Choices*

* Nuri Sahin from Real Madrid (on loan to Liverpool). Turkish. Nuri is a very good player. He has great passing ability and vision. He is different from Yaya though, because even though Sahin doesn't play defensive midfielder, he doesn't go up that far as a midfielder. He creates plays exquisitely though. And he sends very long through balls. It's obvious that Real Madrid have lost interest in him, so he'd be a very good deal to get.

* Jonathan dos Santos from Barcelona. Mexican. Young and aspiring at Barcelona, Jonathan, when he does get a chance on the field shows that he knows how to keep possession very well. With the training he has had with Barcelona, he'd be a great addition to the midfield. He doesn't score that many goals, and is a very unselfish player. He sends smart balls down the wing and into the box. He'd also be on the cheap side as Barcelona management is still in doubt whether he will break the first team line-up. He is similar to Rodwell, with less mistakes.

* Keisuke Honda from CSKA Moscow. Japanese. In his prime of 26 years old, Honda has proved to be one of the most creative midfielders in all of Europe. He makes amazing passes, and has some of the best free kicks in Europe. He plays well with short passes even to long passes. He can send people through with pinpoint precision, and can play up and down the center. He's also very good at all things, Passing, Shooting, Dribbling, and can even score a header now and then.

England has great ingredients for potentially stunning meals.

Unfortunately you are let down by shockingly bad fast food and good ""street food"" is non-existent unless you're in London (and probably other large cities) and even then you have to know where to get the decent food. 

When I say ""street food"" I'm talking about the sort of food you'd find on street corners in say, Egypt or Malaysia, or markets in Australia. I've been to small markets in Berlin that had AMAZINGLY good food.  The markets in the town that I live in serve carnival food - soggy hotdogs and sugary crap. It's unpalatable. No wonder everyone is obese in my town.

This is the stigma of English food.

Pubs are the only reliable beacons of English food outside of London. I've had some great food in pubs but I've also had some terrible food in pubs - and sometimes the same pub.

true,GypsieGenie,EN,england,"As expected really. Bilbao have also said Llorente won't be on sale in January. Lewandowski also seems more and more likely to leave in the summer, than January, so we could rule him out.

Remy was linked with us in the summer gone, but since then he's been making substitute appearances for OM, not really sure if he suffered an injury, but 12 substitute appearances, and 2 starts (in the league) doesn't fill me with much confidence. 

Huntelaar reportedly wants £100k p/w if he's to leave, and other reports say he has signed a new contract. So either unlikely, or expensive. Doubt we'll be in for him.

Cavani, havn't really heard much about a transfer, Napoli are 5th in the league, some 2 points of a Champions League position, so would they be willing to sell their 12 goals, in 14 games striker? Unlikely.

After all this speculation, two realistic names stick out. Gomis who has 10 in 17 so far, and has acknowledged interest from us, and Liverpool.

The other name, Demba Ba. Reportedly has a £7mil buy-out clause, but is also a ticking time-bomb when it comes to his knee. Only RVP, and Rooney have scored more goals than Ba since he arrived in England, which is impressive when you consider he's been at West Ham and Newcastle. 11 goals so far, low price, and proven in the Premier League.

I tend to avoid theories like that just because they usually don't pan out and I end up getting my hopes up for nothing. Realistically, he's probably got another target or two in mind who would be desirable but are less likely. These 2 deals are at least partly motivated by PR considerations. Best to get them locked down and in the squad early than to leave it late and have another deadline day fiasco.

NHS Direct (the website) is good for this. (*EDIT:* Oh sorry I've just seen that you're in Scotland - I think you have something similar to NHS Direct in Scotland but not the same?) It's good because you don't have to trust *yourself* to think whether your condition is serious enough to be seen, you just have to trust the computer system which initially goes over what you're experiencing (and the nurses and doctors who may be asked to give you a call back if applicable), which is probably going to be more reliable.

Plus, it asks you a lot more questions than your GP does. I know he or she is probably taking in a lot of information just by looking at your symptoms and what you are saying, but still, it helps to increase my confidence that something serious hasn't been missed if I've been through all those questions and the end result is just self-care or something like that. Or even better, if the end result is see your GP, because then I'll have had at least two ""opinions"" (albeit one from a computer) by the end of it.

It is only based on a finite number of multiple choice questions though (and no doubt it's based on ancient technology software-wise), so there are cases when it will send you to your GP or even A&amp;E when it probably wasn't necessary and where a human being would probably have applied common sense.",0,1355946997,null,0,1355947369,0,c7j7bpx,t3_14yab7,t1_c7j7bpx,t1_c7hvpap,null,1430720055,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So the price was 3.2% above a 20 year low prior to the announcement, falling to $253 shortly after.

Anyone short two tonnes (64300 ounces) of gold the day before the sale was announced was down around $580,000 at most, assuming they'd shorted at the very bottom of the market. That's the kind of sum banks consider a rounding error, not a threat to their solvency.

I think we really have to dwell on the role of fathers and if it is more helpful or more harmful to have a man in the household, at the very least we need to consider some kind of licence scheme at child birth to make sure peados aren't having kids for the purpose of abusing them.    

I'm just hoping labour get back in soon so we can finally put a stop to this once and for all. The tories have pulled out most of Harriet Harman's vetting scheme making sure that paedos couldn't enter schools and spread their sick thoughts and abuse kids.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; I'd disagree to the claim there aren't any underlying principles

I was thinking more of the fact that logic requires axioms to build from. Sure, you can derive one moral value from another, but there must be root values to build from. Ultimately, the moral principle most people can agree on (verbally, at least) is along the lines of ""don't cause harm"", but there is clearly some self-centered pragmatism in how this is applied. And of course your vampiric sentient humanoids would place a different weight on human suffering.

Of course the fact that the universe simply doesn't care doesn't invalidate morality - on the whole, we are collectively better off because of them. But then most people would say we're collectively better off for having free speech (to whatever degree we have), even if there are good reasons for doubting that it should be absolute.

&gt; I would say they are very specific, even the ""weird"" ones

I used the word ""weird"" in a much more vague sense than you did, and basically because you did. You had a specific principle (free speech) in mind. I didn't have any particular moral principle in mind, though of course there are plenty around.

If pushed to name one, for example, I'd risk crucifixion by pointing out that Christianity had no prohibition on suicide or euthanasia in its first few centuries. In fact, deliberately sought martyrdom seems to have been quite common and encouraged. When Catholicism established a hierarchic power structure of same the type that Jesus seems to have explicitly rejected in the Bible, it was in many ways an attempt to recreate the Roman empire. Where the Romans saw slaves as property, the Catholic church saw the bulk of Christians as property with the same lack of a right to die, but instead of being honest about it they used sophistry and invented moral principles to achieve that end.

Those origins are 1700 years old, give or take, the moral principle was never truly based on minimizing harm no matter how many people took it at face value, but the moral principle is still causing people to suffer unnecessarily.

And the reason for that is basically that *many* social factors trump rationality in moral debates, especially history and ""who's side are you on"". The weirdness isn't just that the core axiomatic values are human choices, and not fundamental laws written in the substance of the universe, but that we routinely override those axioms, treating moral principles that aren't just obsolete but even *never* had a *good* reason as immutable absolutes.

The parade has stopped at the Kevin Lynch memorial, which you can see, while the Protestant church is clearly further up the street.

The town is practically completely Catholic and in my experience, there has never been much animosity between Dungiven's Catholics and Protestants. 

There are certain sections of the community that are bigoted, but as with their loyalist counterparts, this is mainly as they are ignorant, stupid and rarely venture further than about 10 miles from where they were born.

If this was actually outside the church, then fair enough. But it isn't. 

Even if it was, this isn't a defence of putting a flag up outside Holy Cross. The children there were attacked by grown men and had water balloons filled with urine at them. 

That's just indefensible. It was condemned worldwide and would have continued to be if the news agenda hadn't been taken over at the time by 9/11.

EDIT- I also think Nelson McCausland is being really dumb. Yes, the parade went past the Protestant church, but if you've been in Dungiven you'd know that it is mainly one street.

Luiz had a good game aside from his only mistake. His assist to Hazard was beautiful. Our defense started tired and sluggish but sorted it out after half time. Dave and Bertrand played well.

Out of the starting trio, Marin failed to impress me. I think that it was partly because he hugged the touch line while Moses came in field more often. Mata and Moses both played very well. Hazard came on quiet but he also scored. 

Torres..got lucky. Doesn't tell his performace of the game. Poor poor poor. He didn't seem to have any fire in him and although he's scored recently, he didn't seem up to it.

Exactly. The same way the Alliance were when they moved to take the flag down in Belfast against advice. And they're surprised there's unrest? *And* then call on someone else for leadership? If that's all the gumption the self-described middle ground has I want less of it, not more. Because their ham-fisted attempts at 'progressive' politics will result in people dying.

&gt;not someone who needs to shove a flag down someones throat

or someone who needs to shove what they believe is equality down the throats of others?

I'm a normal level-headed protestant thankyou very much, and I don't need someone telling me what view should be considered reasonable. And I'm someone who couldn't care less about flag policy personally.

&gt;Don't bring shame upon the country and force it back into the dark ages.

If anyone forces it back to the dark ages it'll be the gun wielding maniacs who use/foment such unrest for their own sadistic aims. Like the murderers of David Black, the bullet posters, or the semtex holders. A bunch of people on the streets, while bad, isn't that bad in the scheme of things. But handled badly, like the hunger striker park in Newry, would no doubt add to tensions.

'normal level-headed protestants' should perhaps take a step back and reflect on what the dark ages where really like before proclaiming flag politics as the end of the world. Because that's only the start of it, and while 'thickos on the streets' might mean an extra hour before you get home at night it's still a step away from thickos with a gun.

For the break to be effective there are a lot of players to go past first. There was a lot of defending that didn't go well for Bacchio to put it in the net.

I'm more railing against this perception that when a goal happens it seems to be pegged on one individual's mistake rather than the collection of mistakes that happen to lead to the goal.

That the commentators were putting the blame solely on Luiz for what should have been an easily dealt with mistake, completely ignoring the defensive malfuntioning that happened, and then in the second half talking about how great Iva had been in defence seems rather blinkered.

At the time it was an automatic response to hooliganism- the fans were easy to blame because they had a reputation. The government isn't going to come out and say it, but I think it was covered up initially to ensure the police maintained respect (Thatcher was very big on authority, and lets be honest had relied on the police more than most political leaders). 

Follow up investigations in 1999 found nothing, but it's been suggested that not all the evidence was presented. Labour have subsequently come out and admitted they cocked up, and the Home Secretary from the time said he hadn't been given the complete story. At this point it could be that several key officers were in positions of influence so managed to hide it.

In 2012 you have the most unpopular government in decades, and they're willing to find anything to make themselves look better. By quashing the old verdict and admitting that their 'grand leader' had cocked up, the Tories do two things- separate themselves from Thatcher, and distract attention from the negative press surrounding them. Also, most of the police would have retired and policing has changed enough in 23 years that the police have taken minimal damage from the findings.

I'm a linguaphile - I'm currently sitting my A2 in German and have always enjoyed expanding my knowledge of the language. But outside of giving the option to study languages - which is already there - I don't understand what more schools can do. A classroom environment is not the ideal environment to learn a language in my opinion - the time constraints and having 20 other people in the room not wanting to be there is an issue that I feel isn't raised enough. Schools can't make their students WANT to study languages, and that's ultimately what would make offering Spanish more eagerly useful. Whether it's more useful than French or German or not, the vast majority of students won't be able to use the language practically, and the ones who can would have found a way to learn anyway.

For me that meant being bored to death for 3 hours a week, because I already understood the content of classes. That lasted 5 years on end.

I think you mis-understand what exactly I mean by modified. Here is an extremely simple example. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRraEDUxsI

The next obvious question here is. Why do you think fireworks were totally banned in n.ireland until 1996? http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1930626.stm

N.Ireland also has a massive black market for non house hold fireworks. eg http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3251413.stm

The black market will provide full display rockets to people with money to buy them. This is a little different than the little bottle rocket that you are talking about. Really some nails + duck tape is a serious game changer here.

Obviously fireworks can be dangerous in high quantities. eg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_t4yFHZQqc

Fireworks fall under class B or C in this chart http://www.pyroinnovations.com/explosives.html

I am actually surprised that more police are not being seriously injured in situations like this.

The 2nd half however I couldn't blame them. Mata's early goal gave chelsea confidence, and momentum to keep going. Once Ivanovic got his goal, I knew it was over, but I was still proud of the team despite the scoreline.

But how could you call the current royal family dictators?

Luiz is filled with passion, you can tell he gives 100% all the time. He has made some serious tackles and provides quality passing. His marauding runs are both a huge asset and a major problem. He is very inconsistant and does make some costly mistakes. 

Cahill on the other hand is far more reliable and his headers are quality. He is a major physical presence and a rock in the back four. However I dont think he has the same leadership presence as Terry (or Luiz for that matter).

For me at the moment I would have to say Cahill. HOWEVER, I think a more refined Luiz will be a far better defender. When Terry eventually hangs up his boots (may that day never come) I think these two will have worked on each of their weak points.

Then note this previously
&gt;Ministers are understood to have imposed a timetable on internet providers, who will be required to raise their game and produce detailed plans by February on ensuring that all parents are giving the option of imposing filters.

First up.. The only way this would ever work (at an ISP level) would either to force the user to install a 'Start up' programme to prevent Internet Access until the questions are answered (ECHR will smack the UK gov down on this) or for ISPs to install equipment in [Exchanges](http://www.huawei.com/ucmf/groups/public/documents/attachments/hw_111690.pdf) which means that the user would need to have a 'Master Account' with the ISP in question to enable these blocks etc 

Who will have to foot the cost for these SIG Platforms at each ISP? that's right, the TaxPayer...

true,[deleted],null,null,"We can all agree that our defense is more productive than our midfield when it comes to goals (3 mid vs 4 def). We need players upfront who can score, sterling has proven he is still a rookie (nothing wrong with this, he needs experience and he will get it), 1 goal in 16 matches whereas suso has 0 in 6. This doesn't mean they won't play, but we really need players we can confidently sub on when we need to change the game, players to rotate when they tire out and players who will play  replace out of form players. 

Only great players are capable of having form over a season, that is why having multiple players who take off the pressure is necessity for a big club. Sturridge is a goal scorer, if he is out of form, then play someone else until he gains it, but he isn't shit. Ince has shown maturity and capability to play when under pressure, he has also shown some form of consistency. For 4mill he is worth taking chance on.

In a years time we will benefit more from the combined attack of: Suarez/sterling/sturridge/borini/ince/suso/assaidi than suarez/carroll/downing/henderson/bellamy which is what we had for most of 2011-12.

It's not perfect, but it shows progress, it shows that we now have a very technical team and looking to improve on that, we are aiming for stability and spine building. We might lose a player or 2, but when we add 1 or 2 to a solid 5 players, the transition is smoother than when we constantly shift out whole squads.

Borini, sturridge and suarez are all not 100% strikers, maybe BR will change his stance, but from the looks of it, we will not aim for a poacher, your idealistic striker with 2 supporting wingers might have to shift if BR keeps his current strategy.

On defence they are doing different things but seem to be not significantly better either way. Luiz adds intercepts, Cahill adds blocks and aerial battle wins. Both make mistakes, although Luiz's are more eye catching and garner more scorn. The one thing I'd note about defensive ability is that Luiz seems quicker.

On attack, Luiz offers far more in open play. The quick bursts forward with through balls would make him really dangerous with a good counter attacking striker. He adds a lot of speed in general play, which I think offers a different outlet than the general pitter patter approach play that Chelsea seems to employ a lot of now.

The key to this is that teams that are defending well against the normal approach play can be defeated by a great long pass. Luiz is going to improve on this as time goes on as well.

Gary's offensive contribution is more around set piece play. He is a great threat on corners and free kicks, and has scored some really important goals from there. This seems like a more replaceable quality than the through balls though, with players like Ivanovic, Terry, and Moses offering a similar sort of threat.

Examples of object - It could be argued that River's sonic screwdriver in Silence in the Library is an example of this, if the Doctor ends up giving her the same screwdriver that he got from her in The Library. I guess the transcript in Blink would count here too.

Moffat uses this type of paradox *a lot*. However the name ""River Song"" isn't one because it *does* have a discernible point of origin - the prayer leaf that Lorna Bucket gave to Amy in A Good Man Goes To War.

true,Brit_in_China,null,null,"Is it valid that one can have tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending?  This seems illogical.  Well, it is illogical in the context of the current system.  Here is how and why you can increase Government infrastructure spending without a need to increase taxes, in fact how it can be done by decreasing taxes.  This is a little technical, but stick with me here:

(Money as Debt on Youtube, or reading ""Where does money come from? from Positive Money will explain the concepts in full.)

97% of all UK money supply came into existence when a person signed a loan agreement.  By law the private banks can then 'invent' money and type it into your bank account online.  This is a two sided entry and is often referred to as 'expanding the balance sheet'.  This digital money is called debt money.  There is no non-debt digital money at all in existence.

The other 3% of money, which is note and coin, is called Structural Money.  It is as 'real' as real can be.  It is not owed to anyone.

Therefore one could call digital money Non-Structural Money.  The problem with having 97% of all money as debt means that if the banks slow lending such that the expansion of M4 slows to below zero, eventually all digital money has to return to the banks through repayment until there is no digital money left at all.

From late 2011 into 2012 the rate of expansion of M4 slowed until it went into decline plunging the UK into a double dip recession.  There is a direct connection between the expansion and contraction of M4 and the expansion and contraction of GDP.

The problem we have is that M4 is extremely sensitive to the whims of private banks and their desire or otherwise to lend money.  If the banks stopped lending money altogether, M4 would probably shrink by 90% over 21 years leading to the complete destruction of the UK.

So, how can one avoid the collapse of M4 and therefore lessen the effects of boom and potential bust in the future???

The answer is that you introduce a new concept of Structural Digital Money.  That means digital money that comes into existence without a corresponding debt attached.  And how do you do that?  Easy...

Example:  The treasury invents GBP 300 billion and gifts it to a 'Railway Ministry'.  The Railway Ministry contracts the building of a completely new underground super-high-speed railway network.  (Just an example).  Once the railway is operational, the whole infrastructure belongs to the people and the Ministry owes no one anything.  No taxes were needed.

GBP 300 billion of new money was spent into the economy without a corresponding debt and there is absolutely no need for that money to ever be returned to anyone.  Inflation you ask?  Well, inflation can occur if too much money is created, but this money would be created 'instead of' the private banks lending it with a corresponding debt to expand M4.  Up to the crash of 2008 the private banks were expanding M4 at the alarming rate of 8 to 10% per annum.  Hundreds of Billions of pounds invented that would have to be returned to the private banks.  To say that we are Slaves to Debt is factual.

In the case of the Treasury inventing the money, it never has to be returned unless Government seeks to remove it from M4 by taxation and retire the money.

The UK currently has Trillions of pounds of Non-structural Debt money that needs to be replaced by Structural Money.  The possibilities for capital investment by Government are huge.  Trillions Huge.  And in that process there is no need to experience money-printing related inflation so long as the Private Banks are banned from inventing money by way of the Fractional Reserve process and the growth in M4 is tightly controlled.  (That is another part of the story.)

Why are we deliberately tying our own hands?  If we the people control the creation of money we can transform ourselves from being slaves of debt and become masters of our own futures.

To have no concept of where the country is going is simply to sentence the entire population to a life of aimless drifting on the global economic seas.

50 years is not a long time.  I can clearly remember 40 years ago (I am 48).  The world was not really that much different.  We were reading about personal computing then.  Scientists were already considering mobile telephony.  Nuclear technology already existed in abundance, and Fusion vs Fission was already a debate.  Renewable energies were on the horizon.  Robotics were a theme.  Man had already walked on the Moon and Mars was a consideration even then.

Super-high-speed travel was a distinct possibility.

I read and read and read in the hope that I might see some indication of what kind of plan the UK Government has for this country - and I see NOTHING.  Our future is a sad and pathetic vacuum if the Government was the only hope we had.  They cannot even make the simple connection between expansion and contraction of M4 broad money supply and the expansion and contraction of GDP.  How simple is it to claim the following - ""if we want a stable economy we must have stable M4 - therefore we must force the banks to lend in a consistent manner and lend to value creating businesses.""

They cannot even do something so simple, so logical, so obvious.

I FOR ONE WANT A LEADER.  A LEADER WITH A REAL VISION.

Is that so much to ask???  Please give me something I can mentally grasp onto to give me hope that my country will be worth living in when I get old.  Somewhere my children can flourish.

Instead all we get is vacuum.  I don't care if the Government's 50 year plan is devoid of highly specific detail.  I just want something that is believable.   So, in the absence of anything from Westminster here is my 50 year vision of the UK.  Call me a dreamer, but that's just the way I am:

2062:  A nationwide underground super-high-speed rail network.  Aberdeen to London in under 2 hours with just 2 stops.  (Possible today in other countries).  All houses are stand alone power stations and blend into the natural environment.  Double the forestation.  London to Sydney in 4 hours via low earth orbit.  Legislation in place to protect humans from redundancy by AI and robotics e.g. 2040 Legislation. (no one is thinking about this, but as an engineer I can tell you this is a real threat).  Communities completely redesigned and reorganised ensuring the highest level of community interaction and security.  Full youth technical training and employment.  Safe Nuclear Fusion has replaced all coal, gas, and nuclear fission power production.  All transportation powered by electricity which comes from renewables and safe fusion power production.

Actually, all of this could happen in the next 25 years if we put our minds and capital to it.

This sort of complacency about the future is a huge problem with NI society in general. How can NI go on as it is forever? We can't. We have no economy outside of the Civil Service, no natural resources, no private sector and no real ability- let alone political will- to tackle the very real economic problems here.

We can't go on like this for another 50, let alone 100 years without some type of huge constitutional change. Westminister's not going to keep writing blank cheques forever, and when they do we could end up as much a total crap hole as the Welsh valleys with added sectarian violence. Then there's the Scottish independence vote- if the SNP win the Union is over and that's going to have huge consequences for Northern Ireland.

I think part of these protests is that these people have just clocked on that the future is much more uncertain than they thought it was and it scares them. They're not going to stop because this uncertainty isn't going to be resolved easily.

Frankly speaking, keeping your currency so strong has simply led to a flood of low paying retail jobs and other low value jobs of low fulfillment for large swaths of the population at large. This is leading to socio-economic decline. Check out your labor stats. 

We can all agree, the UK and the economies of the western world are 'broken', both because of structural problems, such as demography, and problems with in-cohesive and pure lacking of sound economic management. 

We shouldn't be looking to stimulate growth in economies which are poised for structural declines in GDP, rather stimulate them to produce cutting edge products and maintain strengths in engineering and the sciences. That will ensure that wealth and quality of life is sustained. Certainly not trading of derivatives and reliance on the distortions of the global financial system to maintain an artificial exchange rate based on nothing of value other than trading derivatives. That is plain idiocy. 

So if any of you outside Gordon can tell me a better way to fix the problem, the I am all ears. I haven't seen one alternative, so absent that, you're contrary comments are meaningless and baseless. 

Show me somewhere in history where control of the treasury has led to a abuse of the monetary system? Give me concrete REFERENCES while comparing the current situation. 

An intelligent way of doing it is getting specific. Breaking down the details and asking relevant questions. 

I agree, there are things about Gordons plan which require discussion and debate, but it is a hell of alot more sensible than any other proposal I have seen. 

Why the hell should a countries citizens pay interest on borrowings from their own government???? That is simply a level of nonsense unheard of from people with basic common sense.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"First, I think that your expectations of the players that LFC are capable of signing at this time are simply unrealistic. Even if money was not a factor (and it is), neither of those players, who literally have almost any club in the world interested in their signature, would want to come to a mid-table team in Northern England. While we still have our history, we aren't sexy. 

But to answer the question in your title, these players, I believe, will make a remarkable difference. Why? Because they are players who are capable from scoring from wide positions, something we are sorely missing. A 4-3-3 is only effective if you have 3 capable forwards, and we simply do not. 

Sterling has shown remarkable promise, but he simply does not threaten to score. He reminds me of a young Shaun Wright Phillips, a player who can move from one end of the pitch remarkably efficiently, but once in his own third, runs out of options. 

Downing has been ineffective on the left, even to to the point of BR choosing to swap he and Enrique. The swap was a cunning one early on, but as teams grow savvy to that, it will reduce in effectiveness. 

That leaves Gerrard and Henderson as potential wide threats. Both have attempted those positions under previous managers and not been effective.

With Ince and Sturridge, we have a pair of players who can add to the attacking line in a significant way that we have not had all season, as they are goal scorers. 

It is no secret that we have relied to heavily on Suarez all season, and the Villa game highlighted that. Despite our domination for large spells of the game, our wide players will ridiculously ineffective. We made 37 crosses in that match, none of which were converted in to goals. While some may shout, ""Bring back Andy!"", we must keep in mind that crosses are a terribly ineffective way of scoring (despite what Kenny Dalglish thinks) and are not the system that Andy is hoping to develop.

true,ScarySquirrel,EN,england,"I posted this on another thread where someone was asking about what they should do when they come to see the Villa game. It may be useful:

As you've not been before I'd definitely recommend getting to the stadium at around 2pm so you have well over an hour to get into a busy pub with other fans and have a pint or two before the game. Remember to get lots of pictures of fans on the streets and in the pubs as well, rather than just at the game.

There's a few little stalls outside the ground which sells all kinds of Chelsea stuff. Although they're not really my kind of thing, you should definitely check out the one which sells lots of little pin badges and stuff, there's loads to choose from and it might be a nice thing to take home as I can't imagine you can get them in Canada.

Make sure you check out the Megastore as well. Might be a good time to buy a shirt (jersey) as it's probably a lot cheaper than it is to buy one in Canada.

Try and get into the ground about 30-40 minutes before kick off so you can soak it all up, see the teams warming up before the match and watch as the stadium slowly fills up before kick off. Again, get loads of photos.

Stamford the Lion will be doing the rounds around the edge of the pitch so keep an eye out and if you're close enough go right down to the front as he passes and get a photo taken with him.

Take your seat, and enjoy! As for chanting, you'll hear them clear enough that you'll work out the words pretty quickly and can join in. Before the match this song will play - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZilLLobA3U#t=2m10s

It's simple enough to join in, wait until the high notes and afterwards you clap clap clap clap, then hands in the air and shout ""CHELSEA"" as loud as you can.

Here are the lyrics to Blue is the Colour for when that comes on, try and memorise this, it's easy enough :) - http://www.lyricstime.com/chelsea-blue-is-the-colour-lyrics.html

true,nik_doof,cnty-uk,St. Helens (Fleeing Widnesian),"As per usual, take the Ofcom figures with a pinch of salt:

&gt; Consumers typically raise a complaint with their provider in the first instance. If the provider is not able to resolve the complaint within eight weeks, the consumer can make an application to an independent Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme, which can examine the complaint and reach a judgement on the issue. In addition, some consumers contact Ofcom: on average, we receive around 300 consumer complaints a day. While we do not resolve individual complaints, we offer advice on how best to resolve the issue and use the data to inform policy and enforcement actions.

tl;dr: this figure is not representative of the actual number of complaints, as most telecoms providers use ADRs such as [Otelo](http://www.ombudsman-services.org/communications.html) to mediate complaints, Ofcom figures are based on the complaints they receive.

[Edit]

Just for confirmation from the horse's mouth

&gt; The data only covers complaints that consumers have chosen to report to Ofcom, and does not represent complaints consumers may have made directly to their providers or to other agencies (e.g. Alternative Dispute Resolution schemes). As such it will only provide a partial picture of complaints relating to any provider.

And my point stands - very few of those 19 shots were quality chances, Brad Guzan had a relatively quiet game. We certainly aren't the most creative team in the league.

And what about children whose parents are irresponsible and/or too dumb to work out that there are things on the internet that their nippers really ought not to be seeing? It's all well and good saying leave parenting to parents, but the evidence suggests *some* parents aren't exactly fit for the purpose. Do we just shrug our shoulders and say, *""Well it serves* ***those*** *kids right for having such bad parents!""*? 

Obviously, we can't protect *all* children from *every* possible irresponsible action a bad parent can take, but I don't see what harm there is in having ""default to child-safe mode"" systems in place on devices that can potentially expose them to undesirable content. The trick is making these filters work in such a way that parents can readily bypass them, should they wish to, without it becoming so annoying that they end up just leaving them bypassed.

Again, shots per game says nothing about the quality of chances created - QPR have 13.6 shots per game and are second-last, Stoke have the fewest shots per game but are in the top half of the table. But I don't think shots/game correlates well with chances created - a midfielder taking a pop from 30 yards out isn't really a chance, while a cross fired along the face of goal 6 yards out that nobody gets a touch on is a chance.

- The problem with Bent is he's one-dimensional, and while Rodgers needs goalscorers in his squad, he still needs them to offer more than just goals; for example, Sterling &amp; Suarez have thus far been the best at winning the ball back from the opposition in the final third of the pitch, while Darren Bent never puts a defensive shift in.

I think it would be prudent to look at the Chaebols and keiretsus of Japan and Korea. Government directed investment clearly works to stimulate domestic industry and innovation. The composition of their economies consist of highly skilled innovators. 

Or the consider industrial parks created in China directed at attracting highly industry specific investment.

Investment would never flow to China or Asia if the investment climate is not inviting. 

Now to your point on taxes, I am more or less for a consumption tax and VAT with perhaps a low progressive income tax never exceeding say 15%. 

As an alternate way of thinking with respect to investment, consider a seed without water, wont grow. Right? You can not necessarily assume that demand always efficiently determines and directs efficient market outcomes. This is proven. Look at the Asian Tigers. Even those countries in economic decline, such as Japan, do well and maintain low unemployment.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"I really hope we sign him. Great player, and he is getting better. He would get more opportunity at Liverpool than at Arsenal. I have no idea why Wenger plays him so little when he has been one of the standout performers during a miserable season at the club.

He has started only **six** games in the Premier League for Arsenal this year. After knocking goals in during cup competitions Wenger finally gave him a start. In his last 6 games since he rejoined the first 11 for Arsenal he has 6 goals and 3 assists. I have watched a lot of each of those games, and he really is in top form at the moment.

Since that time he has been consistently ranked amongst the top 20 players on whoscored. But it isn't just [his stats](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/13796/Show/Theo-Walcott), if you watch the games (besides the match against Swansea, where Arsenal as a whole were terrible) you can see his contribution everywhere - off the ball, distribution, getting back, medium and long-range passing and a hell of a shot on him.

An opportunity to sign this type of player, at this age, for free, is very rare. We would be crazy not to take it up. His contract runs out on the 1st of June 2013. Arsenal are offering him a slight raise but don't want to break their structure - so it would be around £70k per week. Liverpool should *immediately* offer him £80-90k a week, a million pounds for signing on, and get a pre-deal in place in January.

This isn't a Joe Cole type situation where you are buying an over-the-hill player who is 90% reputation and 10% specialist role in Mourinho's particular system. Walcott has a future, will always have a value, and could fit into any of the top 6 clubs in the Premier League.

There is no doubt that City and United are also interested in him, and also likely offering him more money. I hope we can show via the Ince and Sturridge signings that we are serious about investing in the future, and that Theo can be part of that (23 years old!).

I wouldn't even bother dicking around with Arsenal, they are likely looking for £6-8M even in January. I'd tell them to shove it and do the pre-deal with Theo right away in the first week of January. He can play out the rest of the year in Arsenal colors with the whole world knowing that he won't be there for much longer. He deserves a bumper contract since he was smart enough to run his deal down - and we should give it to him.

And to say his tap ins are some how less significant is equally ridiculous. Good goalscorers put themselves in positions to score and his movement and positioning has been pretty good this year. 

Bottom line is, when this season began we all said that all we wanted from Torres is goals. He's finally starting to provide them on a fairly consistent basis and now you lot are whining about the *type* of goals he's scoring and who he is scoring against, and it's absolutely silly. If scoring against arsenal, United, City etc is not good enough, then you'll never be satisfied unless we sign Falcao to score 35 goals a season.

&gt; My personal theory is that he's a winger best suited to predominantly counter-attacking sides, as opposed to being asked to break down a packed final third, as has been the case all too often in his Liverpool career.

&gt; Put it this way - he's got decent enough pace, he's a reliable crosser of the ball, and he's got good defensive ability for a winger. But what he doesn't have is much trickery or ability to beat a man, or incisive passing. His best years at Villa were while they played counterattacking football, as well.

&gt; There's obviously going to be other factors, but I reckon he's just the wrong sort of winger for us.

So, in terms of the factors you raised, I'd say it's a combination of not being tactically suitable, not being a good enough player to succeed in a more proactive style of play (Ashley Young thrived for Villa on the counter-attack, but he could also play more intricate football against packed defences - which is why he was ours and Fergie's first choice despite Downing's ""Villa Player of the Year"" award), and the whole mental aspect.

true,delmorpha,ter-manx,Isle of Man,"&gt;Under the plan, people switching on a new computer will be asked whether there are children in the house.

How out of date, completely naive and ultimately a massive waste of time, money and effort. Is this really what they are proposing? The governments choice of prebundled nanny-ware on every PC shipped in the UK? What about tablets, mobile phones, consoles, internet TVs and any other device in the house that easily and readily connects to the net and have been able to do for what, 10 years at least now?

If we have our ""think of the children"" hats on, the only way to ensure this works is to have a state-sponsered DNS server that actively monitors online sites that is opt-in for the parents that want it. They could waste millions on printing guides, just like they did for their *stop smoking* packs, on how to configure the DNS change for any number of devices in the home and the advantages of doing so for those who want it. I'm sure they could peddle these at any number of mothers meetings, or just bundle them in with the NHS care packs when Britney spits out her next illiterate and unwanted offspring. I mean, this is aimed at people too stupid or ignorant to look after their own children after all, or those that think it should be down to the government to legislate on a parents own responsibility to monitor what their children get up to online.

To begin with every site would be locked out and it would be a painful game of allowing sites for a team of civil servants, and even then it isn't foolproof obviously, but at least you can sleep safe knowing little Tommy isn't going to see a massive cock and balls the next time he googles something.. 

It would be double bubble for Theresa May too; she could actively resolve and store in her huge database every website and DNS query all your household devices are making, thus knowing exactly what ~~you're~~ bovine Britain (is) viewing.

The government has been floundering this idea for too long now. Why have no ""experts"" been sought to actually advise how this solution might work properly, or the active promotion of dns level/software/operating systems that already do this?

I've said nothing of what most people do believe, but actually legit torrenting is not an insignificant past time. For the purposes of this argument I don't even need to get into the absurdity of illegal information or the detrimental effect that IP laws have on innovation, but they would be strong ones to include. I'll stick with the child's perspective.

&gt; Also 'they don't have money' isn't really a strong argument for just not paying for content.

It is if you are telling kids to pay for stuff when they have no direct access to money. It fails by its own internal logic:

1. children should pay for stuff
* children don't have direct access to money
* children can't pay for stuff

[1] and [3] are conflicting.

To further the point: why should children be disenfranchised from culture just because they haven't enough papers of imaginary value? Do you think kids (or kids parents) can rationalise what could be 2000£ of software for them to play with photo/video editing software? What about the same for educational books? What about those kids with neglectful or impoverished parents? Why should they be excluded from culture and activities?

Let's also ban children from twitter and facebook making the disenfranchise of the youth a complete list: economic, cultural, political, and social exclusion.

&gt; Not really a lot of evidence for that.

true,hotcod,null,null,"There's a number of times I've come across protects who torrents are hosted on Pirate Bay. But you are some what missing the point. Yes most of what you can legally do on the Pirate Bay can be done on other sites, so can most of it not all of the illegal things. ISP are being forced to block the site in a way that is utterly ineffective and the BPI is seeking to sue members of a political party who where using the proxy as political speech when very clearly there are endless other proxies available. The Pirate Bay can fit on a thumb drive and can very easily mirrored so even if the ban on the site was actually effective it only takes some one e-mailing the latest copy of the site to some one in the UK who creates a mirror and once that mirror is taken down another one will pop up. 

There is growing proof that piracy is a symptom of a lack of service and not a problem in and of it's self. It's been shown that when people are offered legal alternative that are as convenient as what piracy offers they are willing to pay. How much they are willing to pay actually exceeds what the economics would actually predict given that prices are based on marginal (cost of reproduction) not sunk costs. Digital content is both non rivalrous non excludable so the marginal costs current trend towards 0. It's also been shown that extreme copyright enforcement in places like Japan actually lead to a drop in sales of products.

So what we have here is an industry lobbying group taking ISPs and Political Parties to court to block one site in a way that is utterly ineffective in an attempt to try and solve piracy by stamping on a symptom rather than the core issue. The core issue being that the industry they are lobbying for simply refuses to adapt to the new nature of the world in which they find them self. They are seeking to legislate their outdated and newly impractical business model.

And that is bad enough as it is but there's the wider context to this. For the last 100 years they've been able to expand copyright laws almost unchecked in the name of protecting artists rights (which is not what copyright was original about) but really to protect their own, the US copyright laws are literally written by the lobbying groups and then rubber stamped by congress. We've now entered the information age and the laws that govern our ability to copy information are becoming utterly paramount to many aspect of our lives.

To further their own interests they are trying to pass increasingly powerful laws that can and are already used for censorship and often call to give governments control and regulation over a free and open web. We've faced down major international treaties in the last few years that would have effectively destroyed the free and open internet all in the name of fucking media companies (this is also happening with child porn and terrorists) who don't actually represent or care about most artists or culture. In short they are willing to help destroy one of the most remarkable and important achievement in history to do something that won't even help them. 

But lets scale this back just to culture shall we? Copyright expatiation is strangling our culture because the increasingly strict and long terms are starving the public domain and undermining some of the most important aspects of creativity, our ability to build on and remix what has come before. Google everything is a remix for a short and very good series of videos that explain just how important these aspect are to our cultural life.

Every time Mickey Mouse is about to enter the public domain (note this does not mean they'd lose trade mark) copyright terms are retroactively extend. Given that the point of copyright is to incentive artist to create work which is after a time used to enrich the public domain retroactive terms make *no sense*. The fact we now have life +70 years also makes no sense, how can the term be said to be incentive the artist to create new work if his dead? In fact how can a life term be conducive to incentive new work when you only need one great work on which you can then profit for the rest of your life? At this point you'll want to remember that Disney is a company built almost entirely on public domain works. If copyright as we know it now had always existed as such Disney as we know it would never happened. 

Lobbying from the entertainment industry is purely about their ability to secure rights to profit on works that should enter the public domain. The short term rights to profit from work is not a natural or common law right (well in the UK after the Statute of Anne lobbying groups actually forced a compromise in which this was made partly true but in the US Constitution which was based on Anne they only gave congress the right to create such laws for the public good... which at the time did not cover art or music by the way) and it's a means by which governments create a turn over of culture and scientific progress for the good of society as a whole. 

In short copyright is a quid pro quo in which the public gives up their natural rights in the short term so that creators can profit from their works on the condition that those works would enter the public domain. Copyright law as it stands has the public give up their rights for no return and overly secure's what is effectively a government granted monopoly in a way that most benefits corporate rather interests over those of the creators.

What remarkable is that because the industry lobbies have had powerful PR campaigns people actually believe that copyright is about the natural rights of artists and support increasing stripping of their rights while at the same time see less return on that into the public good. If you look at the number of book entering the public domain the nose dive over the last century and the *only* reason we are seeing that number increase is that content creators are increasingly aware of this problem and going out of their way to produce books that are for or will enter the public domain. People are even convinced that copyright is a property right in real terms and that copyright infringement which is morally, legally and in terms of harm (that's a whole other post to get in to so I've avoid it for now) nothing at all to do with or like theft is seen *as* theft. Copyright infringement which is almost always a civil matter is conflated with a criminal act because those seeking to expand these laws say so. The manufacture of moral outrage is a wonderful tool in getting your way.

If you don't believe the industry is well aware of what they are doing just look at the langue surrounding fair use at the moment. The industry keeps referring to things like fair use as ""exceptions to copyright"" which is simply not true and implies that copyright is the natural state. Fair use is the outline of the natural rights to use works that copyright is not allowed to interfere with. Copyright is in every sense the exception not the rule. It's called ""framing"" and the industry lobbies have become masters of forcing the the debate on their terms which if we accept gives them what they want. Hell ""intellectual property"" which is now a some what fluffy legal term is a term used because of pro copyright expatiation groups.  

Talking of framing we also have the problem due to the fact that copyright is now automatically assigned rather than registered. A wealth of work is trapped in limbo and unable to enter the public domain because we can't contact the rights owner. This are often called Orphaned works but I prefer the term hostage works because it better describes the actual nature of the problem.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"One stat that was floating around a lot at the start of last season was ""chances created"" - and Downing, Adam and Henderson were all in the top 10 for chances created in the Premier League for the 2010-11 season (although that table didn't distinguish set piece chances from open play ones, which is an issue given that all 3 of those players took a lot of set pieces for their teams). 

That definitely played a part in the decision, as did the fact that many of the chances Downing would create would be crosses, theoretically suited for Carroll. Also, we know that Comolli (wrongly) believed that the best way to be successful in the league was to be one of the best crossing teams; Comolli's dedication to that belief, and his lack of previous experience in the financial aspect of transfers, probably explains why he thought 20m and 70k/wk for Downing was reasonable.

But it's also instructive to look at the wingers we tried to sign before Downing - Ashley Young was our first choice, and as I said, he was someone who could play the direct, crossing game but also had the ability to play with intricacy and trickery. At the same time, we were targeting Sylvain Marveaux, another tricky left winger; he didn't sign, either because he failed the medical or we couldn't agree on a contract.

So our top 2 choices were capable of playing both direct and intricate football to some degree; there were probably other players considered that we don't know about. Maybe they thought Downing could play that as well, or maybe they valued the direct football more than the shorter passing stuff, or maybe they didn't consider the context for Downing's impressive stats at Villa (wouldn't surprise me).",0,1356016737,null,0,false,0,c7jm3e9,t3_15634m,t1_c7jm3e9,t1_c7jlxmh,null,1430727219,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Have a look at the drunken horde, lurching through the town leaving a trail of litter and destruction behind them. Some of them have been drinking since the previous night, some just from 10am that morning. Take a look at the purposefully aggressive posturing of the bandsmen and the pseudo-military uniforms and music. Take a look at that picture and understand how intimidating that can be for people not connected with the Unionist tradition. 

VE Day isn't a public holiday, the anniversaries of the battles of Trafalgar or Waterloo aren't public holidays, we use the nearest Sunday to 11/11 to REMEMBER the dead of the First and Second World Wars, not to glorify the victory they achieved with their sacrifice. I am neither a snob or a bigot and I respectfully level the same charges back at you. The whole point of the ""Glorious Twelfth"" is to celebrate a Protestant victory over a Catholic army. How can that not be inherently bigoted? 

All your process of normalisation does is force normal Nationalist people to have to come into town and work in the atmosphere I described above. I have worked in town on the Twelfth and have never had so much (erroneous) sectarian abuse in my life. I know there are ordinary decent Unionists who go to the Twelfth, watch the bands, have a drink and go home happy. They are not in the majority, and until they are the Twelfth has no business marketing itself as ""Orangefest"" or whatever bullshit spin they try and put on it next year.

My reply to this still stands; ""If you can think if a single reason not to do it, or an area you might have to compromise, then don't do it. Just don't"". I therefore *like* to think that others have followed this method, and that's why fewer are getting married but those marriages are lasting longer.

true,hotcod,null,null,"Point me to anywhere I said pirates who just want free stuff are awesome? I say that knowing that you can't. 

Yes people exist who just want free stuff and know what? fuck them, they *do not matter* in this debate. If all they are after is free stuff then even if you stop piracy dead over night how is that going to compel them to spend money on things they only want for free? 

Thing is that truth is a hell of a lot more grey than that, most people pirate stuff but most people also buy stuff and it's been increasingly shown to be true that if you provide the service that people now reasonably expect to be available at the price the market deems fair that people will happily pay for that service. Arguing that point has nothing to do with paint pirates as awesome or anything it's about honestly looking at the problem and asking your self what does this mean? 

The only way to stop piracy is to break the internet and restrict freedoms and those are a hell of a lot more valuable than the entertainment industry even if you buy the utter bullshit (provably wrong in some case) economic figures they trot out to show how valuable they are. Even if they stop piracy it will not make their models viable and will not make people who do not want to buy their products as is do so.

As a point of order I'd like to talk about ""huge amount of piracy"" and what it means in a market context. IOS app devs (even directly here on reddit) talk about piracy rates of 90%, that seems like huge amount of piracy right? Well what's odd about that is to pirate apps on IOS you have to jail brake your device. A good guess for the level of jail broken IOS devices is around 20%. Now lets remember that not every one with a jail broken phone will be pirating apps but it does give us a reasonable upper limit of 20% of the market being pirates and that's of course on the assumption that this is a binary choice, which in reality it really isn't.

So how do 20% of the market lead to 90% individual app piracy rates? Simple, paying consumers buy vastly few apps than pirates will download and use. Pirates effectively have unlimited buying power in that market. So while you can talk about huge amount of piracy that volume of piracy is only coming from a minority of the people in the market.    

Now the point is that if you turned every pirate in to an average paying consumer use rates on apps would drop *vastly* more across the bored than than the number of people who have brought a given app would rise.  So, again, in context we have yet more proof that a honest look at piracy actually makes it vastly less scary than it might seem at a glance. We've won the argument of 1 download does not equate one lost sale and the next step is simply getting people to understand the nature of how piracy volumes would actually relate to increased sales if piracy was stopped dead. I'll at this point again point to Japan where their new copyright laws actually caused sales to drop.

All the fair evidence leads to what should be a simple outcome; That simply ignoring pirates and focusing on providing what the market wants and what is best for your consumer is going to be vastly more effective and less damaging to society as a whole than expanding and enforcing copyright in the manner we've been seeing.

Thing is the big industry does not want to change in such a way not because they fear pirates will get one over on them but that it requires them to adapt to a new market and economic reality in which they may never be able to have the same power or profit they once did. Which does not mean, as they often seem to imply, that that money simply goes away or that culture will die, it's actually shown that there are more people making and buying more music than ever before in history. The growth just happens to be outside of the major industry and in ways the industry does not want to deal with and as such its meaningless to them but it should be important to the rest of us.

In the end they have no rights to their business model any more than buggy wip makers had to theirs when the car turned up. This is a case of the free market very clearly undermining a given way of doing things and in this case fighting that change in the market by making their way of doing things the law is not only futile it's downright dangerous for our culture, freedoms and a free open web.

Witsel defines the pace of the game. He's a younger Xabi Alonso, but better on offense.

But these 2 players are facing a lot of trouble in russia, because the supporters are racist and this week, they wrote a letter about not wanting black and gay players on the team.

I would say Danny is their best team player. He's pretty good playing for them (not so much for Portugal), and not a long ago, if you remember, he gave them the european supercup with an amazing goal.

The russian players are well adapted between them, playing  together for years now, with Bruno Alves as the big man commanding the defense.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You could argue that we did sort of have a go. One of the origins of the English civil war was the desire on the part of the Puritans that there be no established church at all. That's where the ""pure"" part of their name comes from. It wasn't that they all believed in God in the same way, more that they all believed that your relationship with God should be between you and God with nothing coming in between. A pure relationship, unsullied by either government or bishop interference. They won, but they also lost because they had no real idea of what they were doing and little common purpose once their common foe was defeated. It was all new turf then.

I didn't know the story with the Dutch, but I had my suspicions. I've just looked at [this](http://www.euresisnet.eu/Pages/ReligionAndState/NETHERLANDS.aspx) and more or less confirmed them. 1814 was your first attempt at it, and there was another constitution the following year. The job was closer to being completed in 1848 but there were further revisions in 1853. 

1790s - 1810s: The French are marching through with revolutionary zeal. 

1814: Pan European constitutional conventions in countries the French have been kicked out of. Many concessions allowed by the victors, very much of the old order, because they did recognise that the world was different now. 

1848: Actual revolutions in many countries, serious concessions to the populations in countries where revolutions did not happen but where the existing governments were terrified of a repeat of the French experience. 

And of course America had to have a revolution to get to that point. It wasn't a revolution in the sense that the French was, but it was a clean legal slate. 

See what it takes? Those things just didn't happen here. All our change since the civil war has largely been via negotiation and legal argument. If we negotiate ourselves to that point without a revolution, invasion or general collapse I suspect we'll be amongst if not the actual very first to do that.

The answer shouldn't be more rules and laws (making it harder for you to start a home business selling home PCs or internet access, and complicating life in general). The answer should be good parenting. 

A law like this only arises because parents have been leaving their kids unattended  with the internet, and ""bad things"" have happened. How was that a surprise?

Every adult who's ever bought a computer or paid for an internet subscription knows there's filth and depravity on the net. Some of us here on Reddit might at one time have been described as ""computer enthusiasts"" or ""internet hobbyists"" on the basis of how we enjoy actively spending so much time online and on text-based forums. But even Bob who works in the warehouse and who only finally got the internet to book holidays and football tickets - even he knew there was filth available online, because his mates had been boasting and laughing about in the canteen at lunch time.

So what parents *should* have been doing all this time is making sure that their 8 year old kids only use the internet on a computer in the living room and when responsible adults are nearby, and talking to their teenage daughters, maintaining a dialogue about their online activities, who they're chatting to, and general safety. 

I'm not a parent, and I'm never going to be. So I don't have the best perspective on this, and I also accept that it's too late now - parents have spent the last decade letting 4chan raise their kids, and now the horse of parental responsibility has bolted. You wouldn't let your kids wander outside on a 8-lane motorway, and you wouldn't show them /r/gore, either, but you'll buy little Tommy a £300 Acer laptop for Christmas, and give him free run of the wifi so that he can stumble into the latter.  

Kids need internet access to do their homework nowadays, and I would guess that starts pretty young - i.e by age 10 or 11 or so. I wish this had been handled better years ago, that instead of saying ""if Tommy doesn't have internet access at home he can use the library"" teachers had said ""now look, parents, if you're going to allow your kid to use the internet, then make damn sure you stay close, or filter the sick filth"". 

I don't have all the answers, and I think a lot of the responses here are borne of frustration.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"I'm going to have to correct you because you are being disingenuous.

You can't make the example of switching 'Gypsy' for 'Black' to show racism, because I think it is perfectly clear and visible to all that when people are talking bad of Gypsies it is usually not because of their ethnicity, their colour, or point of origin.  I believe that it is transparently obvious the issue people have is with the Gypsy *CULTURE*.

And even when people are critical of certain cultures, Saudi Arabia springs to mind, as they perceive them, there's the simple but effective barrier of letting them do what they want to do in their country.  Don't go to Saudi Arabia if you're not willing to fit into their way of life or at least respect it whilst there.  Here in lies the problem with Gypsy culture, because it is very much in their culture to export themselves to other cultures and then not integrate with it - indeed to rebuke it.

I have sympathy for the traveller lifestyle.  I even believe taxation, land, employment laws and such are in dire need of reform to even accommodate such freedoms, but we all know what we mean by Gypsy culture, and we all already know that our society (right or wrong) is not geared to accommodate Gypsy culture and to allow it to flourish.  Yet we all also know that 4 wheel drives and caravans don't come cheap.  There's your second reason.  How do a people prosper when the rules of the land, however wrong they may be, seem to be completely at odds with getting on and Gypsy way of life.

- You can't equate it to race because it's clearly a rebuke of culture and irrespective of race or ethnicity.  I've yet to see a complaint about a Gypsy going out and working 9 to 5 Monday through to Friday, they simply wouldn't know they were a Gypsy.

- You can't say people have no reason to the view Gypsy culture sceptically or to mistrust it, or that they have sought out their exposure to it, or that the Gypsy culture itself is sympathetic to other cultures.  It's the proverbial cuckoo in the nest.

I'm fully willing to accept that not all Roma behave fitting with 'the culture', but there *is* an accurately perceived Gypsy culture, if anything it's probably more accurately a lifestyle choice even advertised by Gypsies themselves, and it doesn't play nice with any other Western societies, lifestyles or cultures.",0,1356023521,null,0,1356038930,0,c7jnrzo,t3_155m85,t1_c7jnrzo,t1_c7jjdqs,null,1430728017,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This demonisation of the unemployed is ridiculous.

If the person is applying for jobs and attending interviews, I don't see the issue. If they're not applying and not attending, there are already systems in place.
