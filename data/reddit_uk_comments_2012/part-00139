(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he—

(a) **sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character**; or

(b) causes any such message or matter to be so sent.

(2) A person is guilty of an offence if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, he—

(a) sends by means of a public electronic communications network, a message that he knows to be false,

(b) causes such a message to be sent; or

(c) persistently makes use of a public electronic communications network.

(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.

(4) *Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to anything done in the course of providing a programme service (within the meaning of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (c. 42))*.

Next scrap those who have sent a CV written in crayon. Repeat, etc. Say you're left with 15 and only have 5 spaces... Then it comes down to a scoring system. Each member scores each application and CV. Scores get added up. Top five go through.
Remember you're not just uo against other graduates but the rest of the populace. So whilst graduates may know not to make these mistakes, doesn't hold true for everyone.

3) Yes and no. Mainly yes. Last job I sat on the panel for had 80 application. Chances are if you get it wrong that a whole load of other people got it right and they'll be favoured over you.

&gt;I think the reason is that I took some account of the sensibilities of the public, whereas nobody else here seems to have done that.

This is a big part of the problem. Should the sensibilites of the public really be respected to this degree? Should a man have his freedom forcibly removed because some members of the public don't like something which is physically harmless and trivially easy to ignore or not expose oneself to? If the sensibilities of our public should be taken account of, why should we disagree with the sensibilities of other publics, which support rape culture, or subjugation of all but elite men, or slavery?

&gt; Everyone here seems to have taken a strongly one-sided view of the matter, completely discounting any injury done to anyone who was offended by the jokes.

We have different concepts of injury, and here's the problem.

Now by injury I refer to physical injury, which is objective in both its cause and effect. While emotional damage is objective in its effect, it is not in its cause, and due to this I think a responsible and mature society must recognise that unless we can account for all variables (which we can not) then we should not take account of some, simply because the majority would desire that tyranny over the minority (or vice versa).

&gt;Consider, for, example, that the outrage felt by many members of the public might be just as strong as the outrage people on this subreddit feel that Woods was jailed.

I'm not outraged because I'm offended though, I'm angry because a man has had his freedoms taken away when he did not take away the freedoms of others. This is a simple clear cut case of an immoral law being applied. He breached no-ones freedoms, yet his freedoms are being breached as punishment for his actions.

&gt;We may think they are overreacting, but we'd probably find that we're in a minority. 

That means nothing, most people are stupid and shitty.

&gt;Millions of people have been deeply offended by one guy, he ends up going to jail for twelve weeks.

Offence is taken, not given, and in almost all cases it is taken intentionally.

&gt;We have to face up to the reality of human nature.

Ours laws should strive to create the ideal world, not cater to the worst aspects of human excess and emotional vitriol.

&gt;We can't just make everyone suddenly stop being offended by things like this.

No, but as a society what we can do is pat them on the head and say ""Now now Jemimah, you're 44 years old, don't you think it's time to grow up a little?""

&gt;I mean, the public outrage was significant.

So.The.Fuck.What?

&gt;Can we really just dismiss widespread public outrage?

Yes, easily. I just did it. It should be done every single time members of the public get their knickers in a twist about stuff like this. They have feelings, that doesn't make them valid or correct or interesting.

&gt;And can we do it in order to protect something which doesn't seem like it really needs to be protected that strongly, i.e. silly jokes like these?

You're saying freedom of speech doesn't need to be protected?

Not sure where to go with you really....

&gt;And no, I'm not a fascist.

Perhaps not. I prefer that word to authoritarian because it has more impact and conveys to most people the sort of impression I'm going after much more effectively, but you certainly are at least an authoritarian, and really shouldn't describe yourself as a liberal. Maybe an authoritarian left winger would be a better descriptor for you?

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"I too suffer from a fairly mild social anxiety and I've developed a few strategies that may help. 

I hate talking on the telephone but unfortunately if you need to get something done an email just won't cut it. Before you make a call, plan the conversation ahead - write down why you are calling, what you're going to say, and try and anticipate any questions beforehand. This makes things much much easier. Also, try not to let your mind wander if you get put on hold, as it will throw you off if/when someone suddenly answers. If you still have serious trouble with the telephone, you may be able to practise by calling an organisation like the Samaritans, I'm sure they wouldn't mind talking to help you beat your anxiety.

Sometimes you can get away with other forms of communication like email. For instance, I imagine your counsellor wouldn't have minded being emailed about why you missed your appointment, she deals with people with mental health issues on a daily basis after all. Have you told her the extent of your social anxiety?

I started cutting my own hair a few years ago, I got a cheap pair of clippers that came with an instruction DVD. Using gel/paste/whatever and having a messy style helps even out an uneven cut ;)

Finally, and I know this is far easier said than done, you really need to push yourself. You'll find that success gives you the confidence to push yourself further and things will get easier. Every so often you will fuck up, we all do, just learn from it and move on - don't dwell on your mistakes.

true,BristolShambler,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol,"Graduated with a thoroughly practical degree in Fine Art (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA fail) in '08, and pretty much fell straight into a shitty minimum wage retail job selling cameras. Did that for 4 years, top salesman in branch, until the chain went under earlier in the year making me redundant. 

I immediately had some opportunities present themself in a competitor's branch, but i hated my previous job, so took a risk and didn't go for them. There was a very stressful 3 months of searching, but about a month ago i was lucky enough to stumble into a new job doing content management for a website that i'm really enjoying. I get a desk and everything! After i got this opportunity i was so proud of myself for not taking the easy option and getting another retail job.



I'm not sure what to offer as advice apart from what worked for me. I always strove to be doing things outside of work whenever possible. This was mainly organising gallery shows and writing for a local free photography magazine. Despite my actual work experience being shockingly thin on the ground, this proved i was pushing myself to reach new goals. I hate to essentially suggest working for free, as i originally tried getting into media and they expect you to do free shit for them for years, but i think these examples definitely made me more employable.


Also, in my own case, i think the best thing i did was not immediately jump at the first opportunity unless you really are interested in working there. Obviously i was lucky enough to have some small redundancy pay to tide me over, but if you want something better for yourself then don't take a shitty job and think ""this will keep me going while i find something better"". you won't, you'll just be stuck there until the branch closes...

After that, I think we'll be looking at one or two players for depth but I'd be very surprised to see any of our starters replaced.

* Make sure everything is above board on your CV/qualifications. I once chucked out a CV because I noticed that the applicant had plagiarized someone else's website on their own. Also, we once took on someone who had a relevant masters degree, yet had almost no programming ability. I now ask for code samples.

However, I managed to make a good few things happen in my fifty years - due to tenacity and good timing!

And this is why I believe that this project is a winner - and more importantly, why the time is now!

People cannot understand that the UK economy is a fifty year fix.

The job market will never be the same again. Many employers will stick with the part-time model - expecting government to subsidise their wage bill through tax credits.

Capital projects desperately needed will dry up.

Essential job skills will disappear. The state will end up paying too much for too little ( G4S Olympic fiasco, West coast rail franchise, Scottish parliament building.)

Crikey, many £1M plus road repairs aren't lasting one winter!

The people need something to believe in, the prospect of better and the hope of a future. This showed itself during both Olympics.

By creating enough inertia, we could convince people to put the odd quid or two that crosses the political boundaries, makes their environment better -yet gives hope to young and older alike...

Projects at cost price, built by the forgotten professionals - aided by the eager youth.

A true community spirit - a proper big society!

People need to feel needed?

For what, truthfully, is the alternative?

Dressing up and knocking doors for sweets at Hallowe'en is called 'guising' - and is derived from 'disguise'.  It goes back to old pagan stuff about the barrier between this world and the next being especially thin at Hallowe'en.  Beings from the other world could take you away - so you should disguise yourself as one of them, so you would escape their notice. 

We always used to dress up and dook for apples at Hallowe'en.

For OP, guising in Scotland never had the 'trick' aspect to it that the American custom has.  Children would turn up in costume, do a 'turn' (sing a song or tell a joke), and get a sweet.  You would get the occasional pain in the arse teenager showing up too late and demanding sweets while looking sullen.

true,frenchphrasebook,null,null,"It is a tradition on the British Isles as it was originally a Celtic/pagan festival – The feast of Samhain (pronounced sow-in)– to celebrate the end of summer, prepare for winter and commemorate dead ancestors. When Christianity arrived on the islands, the church tried to replace old pagan festivals with new Christian festivals. That's why the birth of Jesus Christ is celebrated near the winter solstice etc. 

Samhain was rebadged as All Souls Day/Eve aka All Hallows Day/Eve which is where the name Halloween was derived. Even though the church re-badged the festival, the people did not let go of their old traditions easily and the ones we see today are derived from those – travelling from house to house collecting harvest, wearing masks to ward off evil and lighting fires made from cattle bones (bon[e]fire). 

At some point in Britain's history, these traditions ceased to be practised on a wide scale. They continued to practised however wholeheartedly in Ireland and parts of Scotland. It might be they the became to be regarded as Celtic, pagan or perhaps Catholic traditions which some leaders in Britain might have wanted to be distant from but nobody is really sure. In Northern Ireland for example, Halloween is regarded as a second Paddy's day almost. Derry has a carnival to rival Mardi Gras for the occasion but the Protestant community do not join the festivities. They consider it a Catholic festival. They of course light their own bonfires a week later to celebrate the death of the Catholic Guy Fawkes.

I didn't realise that, as others have said I was incorrect there. 

&gt;I do hope that circuit and your appliance is correctly fused 

It is, 30A fuse at board, 30A cable and every device is plugged in using the fused 13A plug they came with. This is how 99% of the planet does it, ring mains are only used in Britain and India. I totalled up the max peak power of the appliances (including the kettle, toaster, hoover etc) and it was well in range of the 30A circuit.

However, the peak is difficult to achieve in practice, they use a thing called ""diversity"" because nothing draws full power all of the time, an oven for example will toggle on and off due to it's thermostat. I think it's normal to use 70% in the UK, which is probably why many people do manage to trip it from time to time.

&gt; the 30A you refer to is the value of the fuse and not the capacity of the cable it protects

The fuse (or RCD these days, way better) is always lower or the same as the cable it protects. It's mostly the cable it's protecting, the sockets can only handle 13A and the appliance's fuse sees to that. You could go crazy and use 45A cable on a 30A fused circuit without any problems.

Personally, growing up in Scotland in the 90s we always went ""guising"" and 99% of the people answered the door to give us coppers, nuts and sweeties. I can remember knowing the history of it then though, the actual meaning of the tradition. Nowadays, it seems the meaning is gone and its just another way to keeps the shops stocked before xmas. I say xmas because the word Christmas just doesn't sit right with me.

As a practicing pagan, we dress up as witches and I take my wee one guising to a few neighbours, but generally we make sure we're outside as much as possible and celebrate the part death plays in all our lives and the coming of the new year :)

I would say that it already *is* political. That one about 'All soldiers should die and go to hell"" is, as far as I would define it, a political opinion. Sure, it's a pretty extreme political opinion, but disliking the military and thinking soldiers do something that means they deserve to go to hell is a political opinion.

Lets say I am religious, and a very strict pacifist, and I believe that 'Thou Shalt Not Kill' is a universal commandment from God, and that those who kill will go to hell. This is not too uncommon of a view. Then I might argue that ""All soldiers should die and go to hell"".

As far as I can see, that's a political, moral, religious opinion, that to some degree one can reason and back up and explain *why* one believes that. 

Obviously you probably find it a hard opinion to agree with, but should we ***imprison*** a person for expressing it?

Also, what exactly is the crime? Is it the expression of the opinion, or the holding of it?

I really don't know where I stand anymore. I hold some controversial opinions myself, and I used to think that was a good thing, to talk about these things, especially on online forums; debate about controversial issues is how we move forward intellectually.

Bit far away from everywhere else, can feel very isolated. Can be very expensive to get to other parts of the UK from Plymouth.

Doesn't feel like it has the cultural heritage of other UK cities but has everything you need. It's not a bad place to live... There isn't anything awful about it, there are some nice neighborhoods (especially in the very very south near the Barbican and further out in Mannamead).

It's just a bit... thin... or soulless maybe? Place was bombed to pieces during WWII so there aren't many older buildings, a lot of 60s concrete architecture. 

Maybe I just haven't discovered the heart and soul of the city yet.

Can't speak for the football.

Central is very pedestrian friendly, rest is fairly so. Having been to a few similar sized US cities especially around California I would say in comparison it is VERY pedestrian friendly.

6.5/10 good effort, could try harder.

No, it's quite simple with light switches. Point is why should I?

Then I spent another SIX months back on Jobseekers before landing a job in a call centre that I had tirelessly been applying for. It's full-time and very stable as I have passed my probation.

It's pretty pedestrian friendly, with good bus routes. But the football club does leave much to be desired. However we have a basketball team, a rugby team, and a roller derby league (GO PCRG) so there is plenty of sport to watch to keep you entertained.

Living area wise, it's probably best to avoid St. Budeaux, Devonport and North Prospect if you can afford to. North Hill and Mutley is student land, as is the Barbican. I would suggest looking in Woolwell, Mannamead, Stoke, Derriford. 

I don't know if you have kids, but check out OFSTED reports for the schools, and see if you can get something in the catchment area for the school that suits you best. We also have a Public (paid) school, and grammar schools (have to pass a test to get in).

The job itself sucks and I really want to get out of there. Its in retail, and in an especially shitty area of retail. I make under £150 a week.

One job which I got (and was excited for) was pulled out from under my feet when they moved the role 150 miles away. So the outlook is really pretty bleak. 

The way I see it I've got two main options, use some of my other skills to start my own company, which would be great but the investment costs to make use of my skills are high and getting a loan is impossible. My other main option is to improve my fitness and join the military.

So, many elections already use PR. This means that the Pirate Party -- and other small parties -- can credibly stand a chance of winning them, even if winning seats at Westminster is a lot harder (but not impossible -- conside George Galloway or Caroline Lucas).

Even if the Pirates don't win seats at Westminster, if they do well in other elections, that will cause the big parties to adopt pro-Pirate policies (or at least pretend to) once they think it will win them votes, just as all the big parties have had pro-Green rhetoric (and, to some extent policies) since the Greens did well in the European election in 1989.

And as the combined vote share of the Labour and Conservative parties [continues to decrease](http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/fptp-is-dead-it-needs-to-be-buried/), pressure for PR at Westminster will continue to grow stronger.",0,1349834010,null,0,false,0,c6k69qw,t3_116vf0,t1_c6k69qw,t1_c6ju2yd,null,1430108039,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You really have to accept Classic Who as a product of its time. Pacing of TV shows was much slower, and there was little budget for special effects. Also remember that there basically three or four broadcast channels to choose from in the time of the earlier part of the classic series, which is where you've started watching.

But we live in a society where laws are not dictated by religion.  Nowadays a marriage is really a legal construct, essentially a legally created binding of people that confers certain rights and responsibilities. In creating a separate legal construct to apply to gay people, we are only reinforcing the separation between heterosexuals and homosexuals, reinforcing the perceived differences that gay people have been trying to erode for decades, much as racial equality campaigners have in the past. To extrapolate, imagine a world in which the current legal definition of a marriage was between a white man and a white woman. We as a society then progress to agree that different races are equal, so we decide that black people should have the opportunity to take part in this legal joining. Do we then decide to create a new legal construct, conferring identical rights, but give it the separate label of ""black marriage""? Logically no, we confer on them the same legal rights, as we have agreed they are equal. Therefore if you agree that gay people are equal to straight people, they must be allowed equal rights, not equivalent rights.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"&gt;You are not telling the truth. You called me a ""bigot"".

I said ""If you don't think it [Civil Partnerships] are equal to marriage then that makes YOU a bigot""

The operative word being ""If"". So no, I didn't ""call you names"" and ""Bigot"" isn't even an expletive.

&gt;So then you accept that there are differences between ""civil partnerships"" and ""marriages"" then.

I said there were differences, not inequalities. In the same way a black man and a white man are different, but equal.

&gt;For the third time, the right for gay unions to be referred to by law with the word ""marriage"".

What a way to twist words. ""The right to call it marriage"" well heterosexual couples don't have the right to call their marriage a ""Ham sandwich"" so the lack of rights to choose what you call your legal union is shared by both heterosexual and homosexual couples.

So yet again, though I know you wont answer me because you know you're wrong. **Give me a Legal, Social, or Fiscal difference in rights between Marriages and Civil Partnerships.**

NOTE: Your original post:

&gt;Even if you claim the only difference is the word, then that word is an example of difference. Your argument has zero legs to stand on.

&gt;**This is aside from the legal differences and ramifications to there not being marriage equality in the UK.**

Here you assert that there are differences in rights between the two couples **outside naming conventions**.

You were wrong. You lied.  You are trying to avoid admitting the fact that you lied, but unfortunately, when you argue with someone through text, you can't lie about what you have said; and it is disgusting that you continue with this charade when the evidence of your original post is there for all to see.

I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised you'd want to shield your identity from a potential internet mob, while making controversial statements.

You did this because you know that the mob can be a dangerous thing, an irrational thing, a thing that operates out of anger and retribution as opposed to peace and negotiation. It's probably not true to say that you *fear* the internet pitchfork mob, but you would probably prefer not to be harassed.

Now consider how much scarier that mob becomes, when given the full backing of a large and well armed nation state. Consider how much fear can be induced in someone when the mob is given guns by proxy of the Police. Consider how much terror can be applied when the mob is given the power to remove the rights and liberties of individuals for the simple act of opening their mouth.

true,nsk08001,null,null,"I agree he is not as clinical as Klose and would never try to argue that. My problem with Klose lies in I think he could be expensive for how much we would use him, although I honestly don't know how much. He'd also probably demand to play a lot more than we would be willing to play him with the trio of Torres, Studge, and Lukaku(if Lukaku isn't loaned out again as you suggested) already there. This is why I think Kenwyne is the perfect fit. He won't cost much as he doesn't have the same pedigree as someone like Klose, especially considering he is Trinidadian, and he won't demand the playing time that Klose will either. He has hardly been played all season at Stoke for some reason(I think he and Crouch could be deadly together with the height and strength combo). While Klose works for your theory of an older player I think Jones works even better in that regard as he has multiple years left at the top level and won't mind sitting on the bench or in the stand if he doesn't make the squad. Throw him the odd Cup game or injury fill in for the leage and he should be just fine. 

Not trying to say Jones is better than Klose in any way just that I've thought for a while that he could be a great fit as a guy that could come in and contribute if someone gets  hurt.

true,Curufir,null,null,"Actually I've been considering we should do things almost completely the other way. Remove NI and income tax. Then tax businesses corporation tax (might want a catchier name) on income - expenses (not including UK employee wages) for UK business only. Put it at something like 30% to start off with or whatever figure holds take home pay at approximately the current level.

This wouldn't affect take home pay. Employees aren't paying any tax or NI remember so if your salary is 15k then you take 15k home. The initial tax rate would be set to make sure take home pay remains the same.

International business is encouraged to work from the UK. Despite not taking tax income from their overseas business we would be taking indirect income from the wages their employees spend. This is a net gain for employment and tax receipts.

Tax dodging for businesses (cash in hand tax dodging will inevitably still happen) pretty much disappears. The tax is simple enough that there isn't the whole wiggle room we have currently.

All those nice non-salary parts of income become effectively taxed as if they were income (e.g. share options, etc) because they are part of the company profits.

Before Roman, although we had some great players, we didn't have the money to create such a stacked team, and since Mou we've basically had the same central players, just getting older.

Right now we are watching the Chelsea of the future be built, except this time it is being built around a much more attacking style of football.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"&gt;I do not think that civil partnerships are equal to marriage

Okay, fair enough. I'm glad we've got that clear. This belief is a bigoted belief, because you believe that what gives the love between two people legitimacy is what they call it. That is bigoted.

Saying you are a bigot is not ""calling you names"". ""Bigot"" is not an expletive.

&gt;You also accused me of lying. Saying something you disagree with is not the same thing as lying.

&gt;The way you have conducted yourself in this discussion makes it apparent that you only posted this to troll people.

The way you have conducted your argument is disgraceful. Even now, when I have lined it out for you in the post above that YOU said there were different legal, fiscal, and social rights in Marriages and Civil Partnerships other than the name.

&gt;If you would like to discuss this issue, you can address the reasoning I have already presented. 

Literally the only reasoning you have made is:

- ""The name is different which *implies* inequality""

- ""You called me a bigot so i'm not going to justify what I said in my *very first post*.

&gt; At that point, we certainly can move on to what I see as the legal differences between civil partnerships and marriages, and I will back up my opinion with facts

No. For about 8 posts now I have dealt with your avoision. Present your facts to back up the claim you made in your *very first post* in this thread.

&gt;and only after you have rescinded your accusations and insults, and apologized.

Why should I apologise to you for calling you a bigot, when you have presented no evidence for any of your claims whatsoever, and  are now withholding this *apparent* information on legal, fiscal, or social differences.

You know how I know you're lying?

- Your debate style is worthless, I doubt you're older than 16.

- If you had any evidence for your claims, you would have presented them many posts prior, to shut me up. 

You have nothing to support your claims, and it is cripplingly obvious.

&gt;If you do not rescind your accusations and insults, then I will declare that if (the operative word being ""if"") you do not believe that gay people should be allowed to get married, whether according to your church or your government, that you are a ""nazi"". If.

true,mancunian,eng-manchester,The Democratic People's Republic of Chorlton,"24 - left uni before finishing (it's complicated). Worked in odd jobs for a while in 2008 before working as a chef for two years 09-11.

The company I worked for as a chef was a small business, owned by a dunce and run by ex-corporate sadists. I worked illegal hours for effectively under minimum wage and then was dismissed on an outright lie I couldn't prove wrong.

Entered a nine month period of unemployment in which I worked many unpaid 'trial-shifts' for bars which I know from prior experience are often used as a opportunities for free labour.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"The law in question was originally designed for protecting telephone operators from harassment, and has pretty much been copy/pasted into new laws over time. It's very silly. There's a good discussion of some of the main problems over at the [UK Human Rights Blog](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/10/09/twelve-weeks-in-prison-for-sick-jokes-really/) (run by actual lawyers). Among the main issues are:

* it is being inconsistently applied, both in terms of convictions and sentencing. One person gets convicted and sent to prison, another receives a fine, while others are acquitted (at least, those who manage to get top lawyers on board, and appeal) and some are never prosecuted  (such as those calling for the guy charged with the alleged murder involved in this case to be killed, or the various celebrities making similar jokes). It's almost as if the magistrates and police officers involved have no real idea what they're doing;

* it is being applied emotionally. In this case in particular, you have an individual making a tasteless joke about a highly-emotional current event, then being arrested, convicted and sentenced in a few days. Apparently people were cheering when this guy was sentenced; that's mob rule, not justice;

* the English criminal justice system is designed to strongly encourage people to plead early and plead often. And once you plead guilty, it is very hard to get out of it. This means you have people pleading guilty to things they obviously haven't done (this has happened in some copyright cases when prosecutors used the wrong offence). If you do plead guilty, you pretty much go straight to sentencing, and certainly don't pass go or collect anything other than a criminal record;

* along with other ways of convincing people to plead early and often are the ever-increasing legal costs. While not as expensive as in some places, criminal defence lawyers can be pretty costly, and the current government is slashing both legal aid (when legal costs are covered by the state) and the ability to recover costs after winning (which now is allowed only in a few circumstances, and capped at a low value). Iirc the government also removed the existing right to have a lawyer provided upon arrest (but before being charged). This means that if you're not rich, and not really lucky in terms of getting a good pro bono lawyer, pleading guilty to most offences will end up being far cheaper.

Anyway, as mentioned in the article linked earlier, the English DPP (in charge of public prosecutions) is currently trying to sort out how to work with social media sites by having discussions with executives, lawyers and media people (although as far as I know he hasn't invited any freedom of speech etc. campaign groups). However, he's still limited by what the law actually says, so I'm not sure how much progress he'll make.

I worked 20hrs/week part time for a well known brand in a call centre all the way through uni. The week after graduation, an internal vacancy came up for someone to manage and develop our social media channels as we were a bit behind the times. I fucking killed the presentation stage of the interview process and beat out 35 other internal applicants (quite a big thing for me as I can be cripplingly shy in public situations).

Started the role, put in 40-50 hour weeks. Fast forward a year - I've got four members of staff below me and next year I'll be visiting each of our international markets in turn to help them replicate what I've done. Not bad for a council estate lad! I count myself as extremely lucky. The majority of my classmates are either in minimum wage jobs or are unemployed at the moment.

In the meantime I'm not sure how much harm it will cause him.  According to the BBC he was unemployed so he hasn't lost a job. And I'm sure there are jobs he can get where the fact that this happened will have no bearing on whether or not he is employed. Other potential employers won't like the fact that he made these jokes, of course, but if he didn't want people to know that he made them, he shouldn't have put them on his Facebook page for anyone with access to see. He should have made them privately. If you're prepared to put jokes like that on your Facebook page, obviously you're not hugely worried about the potential negative impact on your life of people knowing you made those jokes.

At the same time, if I had been the judge, I wouldn't have given him a prison sentence. But I recognise that harm was done by the jokes. I agree it wasn't enough harm to justify going to jail, but, unlike you and many others here, at least I understand that the jokes were hurtful, and that people were angered by them, and that we can't be dismissive of those people and the grievance they feel. We can't just demand that they stop being the people they are, that they ignore their emotional reaction, that they stop having those emotions. If someone is in the grip of anger, or feeling insulted, you can't just say to them, ""Excuse me, but I don't think you should be experiencing that emotion, can you stop having that emotion now?"" I agree with you that the reaction people have had is unnecessary, but it's a difficult argument to make to say that those people just shouldn't be offended by jokes about a missing child, that one man's right to make jokes he knows will be offensive is more important than any concerns about people being upset by his jokes.

Why do you think he made those jokes? He made them *because* they were transgressive, *because* they were offensive, *because* they were sick. He made them *because* they were provocative and would cause outrage. It was his *intention* to be outrageous. If we lived in a world where nobody was offended by this kind of thing, would he still even have made them? If they'd had no power to offend, would they have been so fascinating to him? It's because they were transgressive that he made the jokes. He wanted to offend people, he wanted to demonstrate that he didn't care about what people thought, about whether he offended them. He wasn't saying anything that needed saying. He just wanted to shock people. Well done to him. No, he shouldn't have gone to jail. But a change in the law wouldn't have stopped the public outrage which took place over what happened.

Just imagine he hadn't gone to jail. Wouldn't there have been an ongoing campaign against him, in the tabloids and elsewhere? People would have been harassing him for months. It probably would have been worse for him, because people would still be angry. He'd probably experience all kinds of harassment and abuse. As it is, now that he's gone to jail, I guarantee you this story will be forgotten about by next week, if it hasn't already been forgotten.

If you want to change society, you can't just change the law and expect people's feelings to change as a result. You can't just get rid of the law against sending offensive messages, and then expect people to just stop being offended by what they currently find offensive. If you want people to stop being offended by jokes like this, you have to change their attitudes first. You can't just say ""Right, the law's changed, you can't have that attitude any more, sorry."" You can't just tell them to stop finding these things offensive. You'd have to change Britain's whole culture. How can we do that? Well, I think it may happen over time, if we're try to promote tolerance and understanding. And I do think in this particular case, I am the one who is being most understanding, because I am not being dismissive of all these people and the strong emotions they feel, whereas a lot of people here are being incredibly dismissive and patronising towards large swathes of the population.

true,control_group,null,null,"&gt;Tyranny of the majority?

Yes, it's wrong, I agree. It's wrong that all this outrage was directed against this man. OK? So now you can stop being so derisive, because it happens we agree. But my point is that we can't just say to millions of people, ""You are now forbidden from being outraged."" We can't just say to them, ""As of now, we are changing the law, and you must no longer find it offensive if people make jokes about missing children"". We can't say to them, ""Your emotions are faulty, please stop having them."" Because *that* would be a tyranny. Yes, I *agree* that it's not necessary for people to feel those emotions, that it might even be foolish of them, but we have to recognise that, for better or worse, at the present time, a lot of people feel them. Is changing to law suddenly going to remove those emotions from all of those people and change the national character overnight? No. If the law didn't exist, people would still be outraged over this. If nothing had happened, the outrage would probably have become more extreme. It would have been whipped up by the tabloids. There would be campaigns against this guy. People would be harassing him, abusing him in the street. It would probably have been worse for him. He would have become a national hate figure. *I'm not saying he should have gone to jail*, but by sending him to jail, the situation has actually, in my opinion, been defused, because there are no more headlines about it. I'd say most people have forgotten about it.

So what I'm saying is that we can't just campaign for a change in the law and expect that to solve the problem. We have to recognise the strength of feeling here. We have to try to encourage people to be more tolerant. How do we promote tolerance? By being dismissive and patronising? No. We should start by understanding what other people are feeling. That is part of what tolerance is, and it's something which seem to be completely missing in all the comments here. So we should be understanding and tolerant ourselves, and try to spread those things by demonstrating them to those around us. That means understanding that people tend to have an emotional reaction when someone makes a *deliberately offensive* joke about a child who has gone missing. (We must remember that it was Woods' *intention* to shock people - if he hadn't expected people to be shocked, would he have still made the jokes? No, he made the *because* they were offensive and he knew they would get a reaction). Anyway, to improve society, to make it more tolerant and understanding, what I think we need is more income equality, more social equality. So that's what I think everyone should be campaigning for. Campaigning against this law isn't going to magically solve all of society's problems and make everyone in the country suddenly become very tolerant. People become tolerant when they're happier, when their lives are easier and less stressful. Not when you dictate to them how things should be. Not when you're dismissive and patronising and start berating them and hectoring them and completely ignoring the fact that they feel insulted or offended.

This is what I mean by the common good, I mean equality, fairness, inclusiveness, a decent standard of life for everyone, and respect for everyone. Clearly the common good entails the fewest people being marginalised. It entails everyone's views being taken into account. This is why I had to reaction to this story that I had, because of the sheer level of dismissiveness evident here on Reddit. It is arrogance, to simply say that all of these people don't count, that their feelings don't count. We can't just dismiss all of the people who took offence at this jokes. We have to include them in our society. We can't just discount them. We can encourage them to change, and be more tolerant and understanding, but we can't just bluntly say that things should be different whether they like it or not. You're kind of ignoring them in your solution. By campaigning against the law which led to this jailing, you're basically ignoring all of those people, leaving them behind. You're not trying to include them, not trying to win them round. You're trying to just shout them down. It's going to take a while for society to become enlightened to the point where things like this won't happen. And I think we're in danger of becoming elitist if we simply dismiss all of these people as being unenlightened. Like it or not, these people, the people who were outraged, represent (to me) ""the common man"". So I think we should have time to listen to them, I think we should *engage* with them. Not dismiss them.",0,1349859962,null,0,false,0,c6kaxzc,t3_116vf0,t1_c6kaxzc,t1_c6k4bry,null,1435679105,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As for the topic at hand, innocence and wonder are so the right words for it.  I still remember the delight I used to feel over Christmas, right up until I was about ten.  Every little part of the build-up was magical in some way, all the little rituals, Christmas music on the radio, the decorating and glitter, the last-minute shopping, the cold winter drawing in, all of that had a fresh excitement to it that I miss feeling, as an adult.  

Sometimes I can still get the scent of it, in my more nostalgic moments.  The adult version isn't pure or intense like the children's was, being marred by (some) maturity and understanding but I can still remember how it was, even if only in my imagination.

One of the ways to get close to this feeling, for me, is via Doctor Who.  When we're in new series mode, and the series in question is good, I sometimes catch myself in a state of hyper excitement, counting down to Saturday night.  Just like I did when I was eight.  

Mum and dad getting ready to go out, the babysitters phoning to come over, and me and my brother sitting at opposite ends of the settee to wait for Tom Baker's grin to appear like the Cheshire cat's.  Time Lords, Daleks, Romana, Adric, Sontarans, Cybermats.  Legendary words now, softened by time.

But I'm not trying to fight any religious wars here - people should use whatever resources are available to them to get employment, I know I would. Here are some of the reasons you might not want to go down the agency route:

1. The job simply might not be advertised via an agency - often these are first-timer jobs in a market where supply exceeds demand, but sometimes companies have 'no agency' policies that keep the advertising in-house for all jobs.

2. The UK recruitment agency world is unregulated, which means you get plenty of good agencies, bad agencies, and agencies that are in-between. My experience of agencies is that they are often just playing a numbers game - they scan your CV with software and the only CVs that light up are the ones with the right buzzwords.

3. An example - the job I finally got - the one I'm in now, was advertised externally via an agency, and also via the company web site. I applied directly - and I have had feedback since that confirms what I thought - no company wants to pay an agency a fat commission if there's a sane alternative.

I have to say the best and worst thing about the city is its location.
It really depends on your lifestyle. By this I mean that it is placed on the coast between four outstandingly beautiful areas, Dartmoor National Park to the north, The South Hams (south Devon basically) to the East, Plymouth Sound (the historical natural harbour) to the South and the lovely county of Cornwall to the West. These areas are all really accessible for walking or mountain biking etc. But it is a bit further from the rest of the UK so if you want to visit other places regularly you have to take this into account.

The good neighbourhoods are Mannamead and Hartley (relatively close to the city centre) and further out towards the hospital north of the city around Roborough and Derriford. Also outer lying areas like Plympton and Plymstock have some nice areas but they are mixed a bit more.

I would say that it is very pedestrian friendly in that the bus routes are pretty good and they connect the Derriford hospital to most of the city (via a change in the centre for some) which might be of interest to you.

Plymouth Argyle are struggling in the league but its a lot better now than this time last year where they nearly dissappeared due to financial issues. Because of the new owner there is some new investment being undertaken at Home Park (the stadium) so the future looks a lot brighter. Its really easy to get tickets and you can purchased them at the stadium if you use the correct turnstile. 

Not sure about the over 40s footie. There are 5-a-side leagues on the weekend but that might be a bit more serious for what your looking for.

It's not like this is harassment where the family is being targeted, it's just a passive joke told between parties - it's already published on a joke website that has also broken no laws whatsoever... how can reproducing one of those to your friends on Facebook be a crime?

As I mentioned above any sort of defaming, harassment, etc. where someone is being targeted maliciously is a complete other world from what this guy did. Even the person who wrote the original joke would not have meant any harm or displeasure to the family.

People write these jokes to give a laugh to other people with a dark sense of humour, not to offend victims of terrible crimes... and if it wasn't for the police and media picking these things up and telling everyone about them, the family wouldn't have even known it was written there.

Shouldn't it be in fact the person who brought it to the attention of the family who are being prosecuted here, not the person who wrote it? Seeing as the joke itself is not illegal, but causing distress, etc. to the family is.

If the family was harmed by a joke that was already written and published on a website which is not illegal at all, surely the person who presented that joke to the family which is the only way they could have been caused any distress by it is the person who should ultimately be punished, rather than the 100s of people who has read it, copied/pasted it to friends, sent it as an SMS, etc. as happens with all the jokes on Sickipedia every day! It's never been illegal to send jokes to your friends, regardless of the content - so why is it suddenly apparently now?

The reason seems to be the ""internet"" is not understood at all.. because the distinction between completely public, private, between groups/friends, etc. as well as the overall context doesn't seem to be understood at all by the justice system.

It shouldn't be that hard really - there's not a huge difference between how stuff happens online and in real life... if that guy had told that joke in a room of the exact friends he has on Facebook, there would be no punishment. Case closed.

Also: Comedians have made far worse and 1000x more offensive jokes publicly, on stage, to huge audiences, broadcasted on TV... now if you believe people should be made examples of to stop other people doing the same, it should happen to a high profile comedian instead.

true,control_group,null,null,"I'm not authoritarian. I agree that Woods shouldn't have gone to jail. I think, in an ideal world, no action should have been taken over his jokes. The reason action was taken was that people reacted emotionally, and also I think they wanted to take revenge on Woods. These aren't things I think should happen. I don't think we should be motivated by revenge, and I don't think we should be governed by our emotions. I don't think people should be jailed for making sick jokes. But I have taken issue with the general opinion here, because I don't think, on this occasion, that it's helpful or sensible for us to be completely dismissive of the views of so many people.

I think the gap between me and other posters here is a gap in the perception of the potential reaction of some people to these jokes. Presumably most people on Reddit have been to some extent desensitised to things like this through exposure to the 4chan mentality which is at the fringes of the culture here and elsewhere on the internet. Even a small amount of exposure to this mentality, accompanied by a group identification with other Reddit users (and other b3ta users), is likely to be enough to desensitise someone quite a lot to the shock value of jokes like this. But I still retain enough empathy with people unlike me to recognise that, to those who don't regularly take part in internet forums, these jokes could provoke a strong emotional reaction. And I don't think it's fair of us to just say to those people that they have to very suddenly stop finding those jokes offensive. Some people may never have heard anything as offensive as these jokes. The jokes *are intended* to be shocking, after all, that is basically the whole point of them.

You might say that even if people are offended by something, it doesn't mean that causing offence should be a crime. And I agree with you. But it seems a lot of people don't agree with us. What can we do about this? We can either try to change the law so that it supports our views, and simply ignore that fact that other people don't agree with us, or we can try to win those people round, so that they will agree with us, and support a change in the law us much as we do. What is the solution everyone here on Reddit has deemed to be the correct one? Everyone here has instantly decided the law should be changed in our favour, and everyone who doesn't like it should just shut up and go away. Or should just change their personality, character, and emotions, so they they conform with our ideals. Is it really the most productive attitude to just discount the feelings and views of those people? Is it really the most rational, helpful, enlightened reaction? To me that seems like an emotional reaction, driven more by anger than reason.

You're saying that people should have been more tolerant of these jokes. But if you're asking someone to be tolerant, you can't at the same time be *in*tolerant yourself. We need to engage with people. We shouldn't be divisive, separating ourselves into a separate camp, setting ourselves apart from them (and isolating ourselves). We should be inclusive. We should recognise that they are human beings and that they deserve to be listened to. We can bring them round, we can educate and enlighten them, we can stop them being so vindictive and so governed by irrational emotions, but the way to do this is not to insult them and be dismissive of them and ignore them altogether. That will make things worse. We need to make everyone feel valued, so they they won't find jokes like this quite so insulting. How do we make people feel valued? We need more equality.

&gt;If the sensibilities of our public should be taken account of, why should we disagree with the sensibilities of other publics, which support rape culture, or subjugation of all but elite men, or slavery?

Clearly the answer is that we should ignore the views of the public if those views are very unjust. But the situation under discussion here is not comparable in terms of extremity with the examples of injustice you've given there. So in this case, we can't completely ignore and dismiss the concerns of the public. The reason we can't ignore them is not because they are wholly just, but, in this case, because they are so strong and so widespread. It would be foolish to ignore them, because problems would continue. We need to engage with those views to change them. We don't engage with them if we simply campaign for a change in the law which invalidates them. We have to recognise and acknowledge them, that is the mature and sensible way to proceed. I think society can be improved by campaigning for more equality. I think more equality would lessen the tendency of people to react this way, since it would reduce general levels of frustration, improving emotional stability, as well as generally improving social cohesion. I've also mentioned libel laws which I think need improving.

&gt;He breached no-ones freedoms

No, but he did do something which a lot of people view as being wrong. A lot of people see this as justice, because their estimation of the amount of harm done by the jokes is different to your estimation of the amount of harm done by the jokes. If you think they are overestimating the amount of harm done, perhaps you should put forward some ideas of how we can bring people round to that view, apart from calling them shitty and stupid, and patronising them, and dismissing them, and saying they're not valid. Like I've said, simply changing the law wouldn't stop people taking offence at jokes like this. If Woods had not gone to prison, people might try to get revenge on him in other ways. Yes, that would be wrong, but changing the law wouldn't magically change human nature. To change human nature we need to be understanding, like I've said. We need to strive for a more cohesive, inclusive, fair and equal society, and that means being inclusive ourselves. Bringing about a society like that would be easier if we were all more understanding, if we didn't just dismiss people, and if people like Matthew Woods didn't deliberately set out to shock people.

You might say that changing this law would be a first step towards a society like that, but I don't think it should be the *first* step, because people obviously aren't ready for that yet. We need to change people's attitudes first, before they'll accept a change in the law.

&gt;You're saying freedom of speech doesn't need to be protected?

Yes, I said that in my original post. The only people absolute freedom of speech helps is people who want to be allowed to say really, really objectionable things. It doesn't help people who are saying reasonable and sensible things, because nobody objects when people say things like that. Why would we need laws to cater to people with very extreme views? What happened to Woods is unfortunate, I don't think it should have happened, but that doesn't mean I think all speech everywhere is somehow sacrosanct.

&gt;Ours laws should strive to create the ideal world, not cater to the worst aspects of human excess and emotional vitriol.

But a free speech law *would* cater to the worst aspects of human excess and emotional vitriol, since it would protect the speech of racists, hate-mongers, people inciting murder, etc. And I agree that this particular law (which led to Woods being jailed) is not ideal, but at the moment, like I said, that seems to be something of a minority view. We can't make it a majority view by being dismissive of the issues. We can't just legislate away people's attitudes, we have to change them.

&gt;That means nothing, most people are stupid and shitty.
&gt; So.The.Fuck.What?
&gt;They have feelings, that doesn't make them valid or correct or interesting.

These sentiments are really quite elitist, and full of intolerance. I'd really like you to think about whether it's entirely justified to have those attitudes. I mean, I'd like to encourage you to try to be a little bit more compassionate, not allow your anger to govern you so much. Your views here seem quite nasty. I think they're out of place. Are you really the liberal, social-minded person you claim to be? How can you claim to be liberal and simply devalue people like that? People are important, they're what counts, we shouldn't be so dismissive of them, we should considerate and understanding towards them.

&gt;Quite clearly you're taking and arguing for the authoritarian viewpoint here, and myself the liberal one. You might want to think on that.

I'm not authoritarian, I didn't support the introduction of this law, and I agree it should be changed. I'm just saying we shouldn't be so dismissive of so many people. Surely ignoring large numbers of people is quite an authoritarian thing to do. You should at least listen to their side. You understand, don't you, that people can get upset and emotional about things which are offensive. We should respect those emotions. Even if we think people shouldn't have them, we have to accept that people do have them, through no fault of their own. Most people don't consciously choose and shape their own personality and decide whether or not to have an emotional reaction to something. We can't just force all those people to conform, to me that is the authoritarian approach. We should engage with them, try to lessen emotionality and irrationality in society in general, try to educate people. We shouldn't just dismiss them or devalue them.

Having thought a little more about your point of sending out 20 CVs per day and the point I made about research, the problem is this: With the sheer number of people that are applying for jobs (see my original comment about 80 applications for the last job offered), it's incredibly likely that there's someone that will have done that research - someone that's applying because they actively want to work for this organisation. Going back to the recent hire: Her degree is in the same field as the department works. At the time of her interview she had a good understanding of what the organisation does, and was able to comment on the work of the department during the phone call offering the interview. 

I appreciate what you're saying, absolutely. Don't get me wrong. Perhaps consider it like this: What the person that's researching an organisation during the application phase is doing, is adding a small amount of experience to their repertoire. That experience is perhaps only something small - knowing what the clients of the company are, perhaps. But, if you've got that experience, then you're streets ahead of some of the other competitors. It doesn't need to be a lot. As an example, if I were to ring you and say ""Hey there, thanks for your application, we'd like to offer you an interview"" and you responded with ""That's great, thanks so much for the chance. I've been looking at what you do. Could you tell me if I'll be working with some of your clients like X, Y and Z?"" that'd make me melt. It'd be awesome. As another real world example: Going back a couple of years now, I rang one interview candidate and said ""Hey there, It's Mr Mistoffelees calling from Foo, about the job application."" ""Oh?"", she responded, ""could you remind me which job that's for?"". ""Um, yeah, sure, it's &lt;blah&gt;."". ""Ok, and what is it you do again?"". See the difference?

In any case, yes, I pick happiness and nice warm feelings for everyone.

&gt;If I have to have racists on the streets shouting about their cause I'll take that

To me, that is a bit too extreme. I don't think Matthew Woods' jokes on his Facebook page are extreme enough to warrant a police response, but I do think racists in the street are extreme enough. Clearly ostracism is not enough to stop people promoting racist views in public. Arresting them isn't too authoritarian, in my view, because you're doing it to protect the public from them. It isn't nice, if you're from an ethnic minority, to have racists addressing you in public. I think we should protect people from that, not side with the racists. Imagine children from minorities being racially abused in the street every day by organised groups of racists. I think it would traumatise them, lead to them growing up very embittered, twisted, and hateful. They would probably then become violent and racist themselves and might start attacking people from the majority ethnic group. I think we should protect children from the kinds of experiences which would do that to them. I do think it should be against the law. Why should it be protected?

I took the job as I just needed a job, and just having a job was great until it wasn't.  At some point, the need to progress and do something I'm happy with as opposed to settling for came and kicked me in the teeth.

I love it when people attribute words to me. I **said**  nothing of the sort.

However I did **write** that maybe people should start thinking first before being offensive enough to warrant a conviction. 

To clarify further what I mean in this is, if in the eyes of the law someone writes something, be it repeated (and/or modified) from another source, that it causes extreme/substantial distress or is found to be grossly offensive toward the person or persons it is aimed at, then yes they should be held accountable.

As for the justice system sacrificing one persons future to discourage crimes of a similar type. In my opinion if you're willing to commit a crime then don't cry when you get caught to pay the time. Regardless of the sentence he was convicted of an offence that was/is criminal and as such will suffer the consequences of that.

I personally think a lot of sentences these days are far too lenient and a 12 weeks custodial (which I suspect will be suspended) sentence is more than appropriate not less and that too many others get away with worse.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"I'm going to ignore the moral arguments because they just don't interest me. Let's discuss the economic arguments, and what proportion of benefits are re-spent into the local economy (i.e. [circular flow of money theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_flow_of_income)).    

So you take out 10m in benefits, but that 10m is spent at local shops, on local goods, and on local services. So that 10m obviously hurts the benefits recipients who receive it but it also hurts the people who support them by providing them goods and or services.      

I guess my point is: regardless of morals if you remove 10m from the UK economy which is almost entirely locally spent, you're going to hurt UK economic growth. Because this money starts at the bottom (i.e. poorest) and is re-spent several times before either going off-shore or being eating in tax, that 10m injection might wind up costing the UK economy as a whole 30 or 40m (not in tax, but in economic activity).    

I know it sounds arse-backwards but giving money to societies poorest is actually a great way to generate economic activity. The higher you go up the economic food-chain the quicker the money disappears off shore or into long term savings accounts (neither of which are great for the UK).    

So I guess my point is: this move is bad for the UK. Even if it is the morally right thing to do and something that aligns with the Tories' values, it still might hurt economic growth more than it helps bring down the deficit. One might even argue that generating economic activity is a greater way to bring down the deficit in the long run.     

PS - I think the best thing the government has done to help the economy in recent days is their new ""small business loan"" bank. They gave up on injected money into traditional banks who refused to hand it out and cut out the middle-man. Now businesses can apply to the government direction for this money. Good stuff...

Right in the feels. 

I'm getting married shortly and I don't think we'll be able to have children anytime soon because we can't afford it, despite two decent salaries coming in.

Personally, I'd like to see the Government spend a whole lot less on just about everything and give me more of my paycheck back. 






&gt;I'm in receipt of income support of £125 per fortnight, child tax credits of £230 per week, child benefit of £220 per month, housing benefit of £400 per month and council tax benefit of £100 per month. I'm an engineering graduate and I was made redundant just before my youngest child was born.


Edit: I apologise my math was wrong. Its 1890/mo. Still more than I get after tax each month. 
Just to confirm, I had initially calculated her receipts at over 35k by calculating child benefit as weekly not monthly.

That's *still* pretty sad and equals £25k salary. Also, no commuting costs. Furthermore, if the father is is employment (big if considering they don't understand contraception, he will be paying child support.) 

Yeah 4 kids..but seriously, 4 kids?

I don't disagree with how you feel when you hear someone ""breaching the peace"" as you described it, we all think for instance when we see the EDL or Islamic extremists calling for the death of Britain that someone should run up and deal with them...in some way or another.

However, the real problem I have with this like I said is how fuzzy the law is, and bringing a law in that says it's okay to say you want to kill the prime minister as long as its in a private forum is going to cause problems I think.

For example, you definitely could argue that Facebook is a private forum because you can choose who see's your posts etc. Same with protesting if you own the property you're protesting on with something crass on a sign in it then I suppose you could argue that legally it's your private property so it's all gravy.

I get where you're coming from. I just find it a dangerous road to go down because very quickly we could have political activists on every side saying that the other is being blatantly offensive to their fellow man and that their voices must be silenced.

I don't think freedom of speech should be necessary unlimited because that would excuse bullying and things like that but we really have to think through what constitutes a crime, especially with things so subjective like jokes. It could result in a clusterfuck.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"&gt; The issue though then is whether you can generate enough economic activity from the £10m which you have to borrow from the banks to be able to repay the loan.    

That is a very valid point.    

But the UK's economic growth is based as much on confidence as it is on realities. It is all circular.    

For example if a business is ""concerned"" about the economic situation/climate then they might put off that expansion that they've been waiting to do. Which results in them not hiring one or two people which in turn actually causes the loss of business they were concern would happen (or at least might cause it when multiplied by tons of businesses).     

Or the family might put off buying that house or that car because they're worried about their job security.     

Everyone, meaning both businesses and individuals, are watching the economic growth figures and while they remain flat or worse in decline then people will keep them that way by acting conservative and leaving their money in the bank ""just in case.""    

I think your point that it might literally cost us more than it makes is very valid and likely correct; but when you look at the ""bigger picture"" then it gets more complex. If the economy was healthy then this kind of policy might work much better than it does with the current state of affairs (i.e. we needed this pre-2008).

Every penny that goes towards benefits, comes from someones pocket, or from a company. Say the government taxes a company 10% of it's profits.

That company now has 10% less per year to invest in growth. So perhaps a few projects don't get financed, that otherwise would have. Well, those projects would likely have created some jobs.

And taxation from the individual? Well, when an individual has surplus income, he spends it on items like a new TV, a new car, a holiday, etc. He creates the demand for societies products, which in turn, generates jobs and economic growth.

That 10m that you're talking about? A large amount of it probably goes right into the pockets of the major supermarkets, paying for family groceries for people with multiple children. So it doesn't get spent on ""local businesses"" like you claim.

Long term savings accounts are good for the UK. What do you think the bank does with that cash? It invests it in business loans, which finance projects and stimulate economic growth in the private sector. Or it invests it in government bonds.

Taxation kills economic growth. It puts marginal businesses out of business, and squeezes everyones profit margins, so they don't have the means to invest in developing their businesses (which creates jobs).

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"&gt; Every penny that goes towards benefits, comes from someones pocket, or from a company.   

Technically right now every penny comes from loans. :)    

&gt; That 10m that you're talking about? A large amount of it probably goes right into the pockets of the major supermarkets, paying for family groceries for people with multiple children. So it doesn't get spent on ""local businesses"" like you claim.    

True but those big supermarkets hire local people to work the tills. They also hire lorry drivers to move goods, and the food has to come from somewhere and some of it comes from the UK.    

It isn't as good for the local economy as real local businesses are but it isn't completely negated by the fact that they're a monster corporation.     

&gt; Long term savings accounts are good for the UK. What do you think the bank does with that cash? It invests it in business loans, which finance projects and stimulate economic growth in the private sector. Or it invests it in government bonds.    

Much of it is internationally invested. Some of it might be invested locally but a lot of it won't be, so it won't impact the UK specifically as much as local money would be. It isn't that it adds nothing, it just acts in a less effective way than the poor spending do.    

&gt; Taxation kills economic growth. It puts marginal businesses out of business, and squeezes everyones profit margins, so they don't have the means to invest in developing their businesses (which creates jobs).    

I agree that taxation on small businesses is very painful. Some of it is required but they do so much good that they should be given a somewhat free ride.    

I think for larger corporations and international businesses, because of where the money ends up (i.e. in a handful of individual's pockets and off-shore) it is less of a concern to the UK in particular.    

&gt; So yeah. Basically, everything you said is wrong, and you should feel bad.    

Opinions are not the same as facts. Neither yours or mine. Wrong is a matter of perspective. In particular as neither of us cited sources (e.g. economic studies).

Essentially, Sharia law doesn't allow for the charging of interest. But realistically, I'm not sure how this affects a muslim player since they would not be technically lending money.

I would normally say this was a way of pandering to a small, vocal minority. However, considering the footballer is at his place of work (and wearing a uniform) it should respect his/her religion. But this is really a completely different story and nothing to do with sharia law, but to do with employment law and religion.

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I say we take action to get Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 repealed and Matthew Woods pardoned for his 'crime':

[Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127) reads:

&gt; (1)A person is guilty of an offence if he—

&gt; &gt; (a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character; or

&gt; &gt; (b)causes any such message or matter to be so sent.

&gt; (2)A person is guilty of an offence if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, he—

&gt; &gt; (a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network, a message that he knows to be false,

&gt; &gt; (b)causes such a message to be sent; or

&gt; &gt; (c)persistently makes use of a public electronic communications network.

&gt; (3)A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.

&gt; (4)Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to anything done in the course of providing a programme service (within the meaning of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (c. 42)). 

The problem with this Act is that a 'public electronic communications network' is too broadly defined hence why Matthew Woods' Facebook status was considered under this Act as a message transmitted via a public electronic communications network. Perhaps if he had his entire profile set to Friends Only which isn't too unreasonable in the modern day considering invasions of privacy that can occur, this may have been different in the eyes of the jury or the judiciary. But it's not like he directly sent the message to any of April Jones's family members or to any April Jones related Facebook groups. This was a joke he almost-literally copied and pasted from Sickipedia and posted on his own Timeline to anybody that would view his page. It would also appear on the feeds of anybody that had him added as a friend.

The other problem with this Act is that it did nothing to punish or even apprehend the fifty people that presumably threatened Matthew Woods with physical violence and subsequently turned up on his doorstep, prompting the police to arrest him and deny him bail terms 'for his own safety.' And all this and a later twelve week prison sentence over posting a joke copied and pasted from http://www.sickipedia.org on his own personal timeline, not directly targeting anybody with the message.

The people that actually arrived on Matthew Woods' doorstep should have been locked up for attempting to cause an assault, not merely ignored without a single shit given by the police.

Matthew Woods also did nothing to actually harass April Jones's family or any group members supporting her. It is presumed that his Timeline status was merely discovered and commented upon, causing a mexican wave of outrage to rapidly spew upon him.

In attempting to stop online harassment, the Communications Act 2003 actually causes the opposite effect, a gross clamp-down on freedom of speech and expression.

Also - I did point out she does not pay for commuting costs, work clothes and she must get child support. Therefore her final income is probably higher than £25k.

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;Technically right now every penny comes from loans. :)

Governments typically have four primary ways of raising revenue.

1. Taxation - expropriating the wealth of it's citizens.
2. Inflation - Printing money, and exploiting the pre-inflation price-difference before the affects of inflation are felt (a stealthy tax)
3. Loans - Which must eventually be paid back, with interest, using wealth obtained using the above methods.
4. War - Invading somewhere and stealing stuff. Not so nice, tbh.

So even if all benefits were paid for out of loans, those loans will have to be repaid through taxation or monetary expansion. Loans simply defer the opportunity costs onto a future generation (which sucks for them).

&gt;True but those big supermarkets hire local people to work the tills. They also hire lorry drivers to move goods, and the food has to come from somewhere and some of it comes from the UK.

Those large super-markets also out-compete local businesses, and use their power to bargain-down local producers. Remember the dairy farmers protests a few months back?

I'm undecided on whether supermarkets are good or bad for the economy. On the one hand, they decimate local economies and high-streets. On the other hand, they provide consumers with cheaper produce, giving them more disposable income for non-grocery shopping. What they certainly do, is push local businesses to compete with overseas producers, something that many can't do because of the disparity in taxation and regulation (caused by our extensive welfare state). 

Unfortunately it's currently infeasible for British producers in a highly regulated, highly taxed economic system, to compete with more economically liberal, formerly socialist countries like India and China, who underwent partial-privatisation, deregulation and reduced taxation in 1985 and 1991 respectively.

&gt;Much of it is internationally invested. Some of it might be invested locally but a lot of it won't be, so it won't impact the UK specifically as much as local money would be. It isn't that it adds nothing, it just acts in a less effective way than the poor spending do.

A good point, it'd be interesting to see what percentage of investment goes to the East as opposed to going to UK businesses. The problem is that until British companies can offer similar ROIs, and less risk (Many banks are worried about lending to the UK because of the Eurozone trouble, and the spectre of quantitative easing) the East will continue to secure investments.",0,1349882129,null,0,false,0,c6ke34e,t3_118zvi,t1_c6ke34e,t1_c6kdl56,null,1430111790,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I know, that's what your an authoritarian.

&gt;Clearly ostracism is not enough to stop people promoting racist views in public.

It clearly is, plenty of countries don't criminalise racial speech and yet racism has declined massively in some of those in the last 50 years (The US being a prime example).

&gt;Arresting them isn't too authoritarian, in my view, because you're doing it to protect the public from them.

Protect the public from what? Hearing someone talk? Don't you realise that the second you start thinking you're fit to decide what the public should and shouldn't be exposed to, you're elevating yourself above them, that you're becoming their master whether they like it or not?

&gt;It isn't nice, if you're from an ethnic minority, to have racists addressing you in public.

Perhaps not, but it does you no harm.

Again, [from Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Heung-Min#Style_of_play):

&gt;Son is known as a versatile attacker due to his ability to use both feet equally well; **he can play either as a striker, attacking midfielder, or winger on either side**. Son has confirmed this, saying, ""I don't care where I play. The main thing is I'm in the game. I can play right, left, as a forward or behind it. **What the coach says, I'll do.** I don't have a favorite position. I'll be anywhere and always on the throttle."" Other strengths of Son include his explosive pace, dribbling abilities, composure in front of goal, and hard-working nature.

If it was, you would have a computer system that would decided a sentence depending on the crimes input. However, the law doesn't work like that. It is a human law, and judgement is passed by a human who is granted that power by people who think he or she is capable of enacting judgement fairly.

In this case, the things this guy said were so vile, so sickening, that the judge wanted to teach the kid a lesson. And I agree with it. Maybe three months was a bit much, but how far would you go? In an era where slaps on the wrists do nothing, how far do you *need* to go before someone takes notice?

Facebook is not a private forum. It is not owned by that guy, the people who access it who see his feed did not sign up for sick jokes. If it was set up by him and people accessed it privately for the intention of seeing his sick rants, then sure, you could call it private. But it isn't.

The law has to be able to adapt to different scenarios because none of them are ever exactly the same. 

When there is sufficient reason to throw someone in prison, they can, and sometimes, they will. They will never throw someone in prison for political rants or religious rants unless they threaten the peace. They will, however, throw people in for bullying, racism or sickening remarks.

Keyboard gangster or not, he should face the same laws that megaphone gangsters and loud-voice gangsters as well as permanent-marker-and-large-cardboard-sign gangsters face.

&gt;I would love it if the rest of this subreddit followed Suarez's lead. We get it. The FA is shitty, most refs are shitty, Man U fans are shitty, but can we please discuss something else.

To add to his comment...

The club, the player, the boss, they are - unfortunately - *not* going to change the minds of a nation, opposing players, opposing supporters, the refs, the FA.

Fact is:

1. Luis Suarez is being treated the way he is due to the reputation he created.

2. Consequently, Suarez is - fair or not - stuck with that reputation.

3. And, in spite of obvious fouls, the refs clearly have not called these fouls based on that reputation.

4. Unless, Suarez changes and adapts (again, as unjust as this is).

*Everyone* dives, right? But judging from a general overview of non-partisan supporters, the media, etc. it's not that Suarez dives but it's *how* he dives.

So, what is the solution?

In my opinion, Suarez simply needs to adapt a bit (again, as unjust/unfair as this is) to these refs. He needs to be a bit less-theatric, not 'over-sell' the foul, stay up as much as possible, he has to almost be stoic and simply score goals, let his game do the talking.

Is it unfair? Yes! Is it unjust? Yes! Are the refs biased? Of course! Is the media biased? Yes!

But whinging about it isn't going to help change already preconceived notions of Suarez.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Browsers already have a mechanic to ask the user's permission before accepting a cookie so why do we need the web-sites to do that too?

This was a common argument that many of the sites I worked on at the time said as well.  The argument against it from the ICO was that it wasn't an obvious enough piece of functionality and most people ignored it.  Therefore you weren't actively choosing to accept cookies, just not actively choosing to not accept them.

A lot of the research that they did at the time on cookies pointed towards the fact that there was a misconception about what they were and how they were used.  Rather than a process of enlightening people so that they could make informed decisions, they went for the opposite route of banning them.  Worst still is that because this is an EU directive each country has implemented it into their own law in a different way, so if your site is in use in different countries you might have different legislation at play.

To be fair to the ICO, they're still actively sounding out that they want this to be implemented but then not proactively doing anything about it.  It took years if not decades for them to start issuing fines for breaking the Data Protection Act and I guess this will be similar.",0,1349886611,null,0,false,0,c6kfewg,t3_1192ac,t1_c6kfewg,t1_c6kdrn9,null,1430112428,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Yes, he is really good at man management, yes, he has made Chelsea into a family again, yes, he is really good at understanding the situation in the locker room, and yes he seems to know how to make all his players happy while at the same time having them respect his authority..

But what's often overlooked is how insightful and effective he has been in selecting the right players, the right formations, and the right tactics for almost every single game that we've played since he took over.  Bertrand playing in midfield for the Champions League Final..  What!?  Where the hell did that come from?  It was done for a very specific reason, it was probably unanticipated by Bayern, and it worked.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"A poster on a forum I read made a really really good point about Walker that I hadn't thought of. He was watching games from last season and noticed that Kyle wasn't really doing a lot differently in terms of his positioning without the ball and that sort of stuff. One could argue that we were more gung-ho so Kyle had more of an opportunity to use his pace to defend (recovery) which is what he's best at, but overall it wasn't that different. 

The difference, he concluded, was Scott Parker constantly covering for him. And when I just think back to last season, he's absolutely spot-on. Parker basically fucking LIVED in that channel and helped Walker out. 

Our midfield structure is much more of a pivot now so we don't really have a player who is able to babysit as much; our midfielders are splitting duties. There are some things like judging the flight of aerial balls that he seems to have lost all competency for, but he's never really been strong positionally unfortunately. 

I can live with a few positional errors; happens to all defenders. But what I'm getting fucking fed up with is these mindless infield runs that inevitably lead to him giving the ball away and us getting counter attacked. If he does that against Chelsea, they will 100% score. 

He says his hero is Dani Alves and you can see the similarities (games based heavily on athleticism and recovery) but you don't see Alves trying to surge infield and dribble people in his own fucking 3rd. Someone needs to tell him to just pass back to the keeper or hoof it if he gets freaked out and feels compelled to cut inside deep in his own half. He doesn't have the ball control to do that. He's done it a few times every game and lost possession almost every time, putting us under ridiculous pressure.

true,scg30,1953,Frank Lampard,"I think MOFUNKY's statement should be amended to: We wont fire a *trophy* winning manager.

Carlo was let go after he failed to secure any silverware in his second term, even though he managed to get us to 2nd in the league and the quarter finals of the CL (both accomplishments which required us to *win* a lot of games). 

Just look at Grant: under him we reached two cup finals finishing runners-up in both, and ended up 2nd in the Prem missing out on the title by just two points. He was cut loose almost immediately. Now I'm no Grant apologist and I don't happen to think he was, or is, all that great a manager, but the point is we had a very *winning* season in 2007-08 in terms of our match record. However, we were unable to secure a single trophy.

History shows that this has been the gold standard for Roman post-Mourinho when deciding whether or not to keep a manager in the job. (With the exceptions of Scolari and AVB, who were sacked out of a fear of not maintaining the status quo, ie UCL qualification). Whether or not you agree with it personally, (which I don't entirely), you can't deny it has yielded results. **5 major titles over 5 years (1 Premier League title, 3 FA Cups, and our first European Cup)**

**TL;DR** - If Robbie doesn't manage to win a single trophy this season, even if we do end up with an extremely high win rate/record and league table position, I would not be surprised at all if Roman sacked him.


----

**EDIT:** This is why, personally, I would rather welcome Mourinho back than go after Pep. 

Mourinho is the only manager in the world who can virtually guarantee you at least one trophy a year, (having won *at least* one title/cup every calendar year since 2002). Can you just imagine what a man of Mourinho's tactical discipline and motivational capacity could do with the slew of extremely talented but still developing players at our football club? (david luiz, ramires, romeu, azpi, bertrand, cahill, hazard, oscar, kevin de bruyne, lukaku). We would be a real force. 

He also has a personality big enough, and the trust and respect necessary, to convince the older players to commit to a short-term contract if he wanted them in his squad, and to let them go gracefully if he deemed them surplus to requirements. 

It's a pipe-dream I know, but if I could have any man in the world managing my club it'd still be Jose. No question.",0,1349889672,null,0,1349890858,0,c6kgc4a,t3_118kmf,t1_c6kgc4a,t1_c6kcrth,null,1430112871,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; not least because demonization is recognised as the final stage before mass violence against, &amp; killing of, members of the demonized communities starts?

As far as I am concerned, that is what religions *do.* To prevent one religion demonising another, denouncing them, and so on is to prevent them from expressing their religious beliefs.

Of course, I'm completely open to a system like they have in Singapore, where every religion can only say whatever is permitted by The State, and any derogatory remarks about other religions are met with jail or worse.

Personally, as an atheist, I would prefer to be able to criticise any religion without worry that I was causing offence, given that they are all completely mental. To me, it's like not being able to tell inmates of an insane asylum that they are insane for fear of giving offence. And, equally, to an Evangelical Christian, forbidding them from telling a Hindu or Muslim that they are going to Hell for not believing in Christ as Saviour, is tantamount to preventing them from performing the task their religious belief tells them God has charged them with. Jehova's Witnesses are also similarly charged with the act and belief of conversion.

The thing about religious belief is that a religion not only charges you with beliefs, but also actions - and those actions are as much a part of the religion as the belief. Some of those actions are perfectly benign (prayer and so on) and some are not. So, it's not easy to draw a line between religious belief, criticism and areas where offence may be caused. 

Ultimately, your stance is that the state, through the legal system, has the right to excise parts of every religion in the name of protecting all religions? Even if, to some religions, the inability to evangelise (for example) renders their religion meaningless?

Or, are you saying that all parts of religion are protected and may criticise each other freely, evangelise, cause offence and so on, but only godless assholes like me are forbidden from criticising the faithful?",0,1349890675,null,0,false,0,c6kgmpv,t3_118u2s,t1_c6kgmpv,t1_c6kfyx7,null,1435678975,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I was going to make the comment further up, but I'll make it here instead:

The French go too far in banning the headscarf in public, in my opinion, even though I'd be happy if it was abandoned by (Muslim) women. I don't understand how they think they can justify it adequately. Unless they count ""public"" as being ""government controlled"" as it were? I'm not sure how people are supposed to operate otherwise - there is a definite need to enter the public space and I'm not sure anyone should legislate in this way. The very iffy thing about that law is that they're not banning other religious items or clothing, so far as I know. Are skullcaps on the ban list?

Disclaimer: I very much dislike the headscarf as, even though there are numerous Muslim women who speak about how empowering it is, there are a shedload who don't even get the choice and are also taught/told they must wear it from a young age: not exactly being given a fair start.

Nowhere in your reply have you attempted to deal with the points I raised, which were made to ascertain what liberties you would see strengthened or weakened.

My point was, that it is a thorny issue and that much of one person's religious belief would be offensive or inimical to another's and that, therefore, to be fair to both believers and non-believers, no protection should exist.

However, if all belief is to be protected, and one follower is to be protected from a follower of another religion, then the religion must itself be moulded and shaped by the state so that it is as inoffensive as possible, the rough edges where one's religious beliefs come into conflict with another's must be sanded away and prescribed actions that cause conflict must be excised, even if they lay at the core of the belief.

true,control_group,null,null,"&gt;You're happy to make some people suffer immensely in order to satisfy the desires of the wider group.

&gt;Don't you realise that the second you start thinking you're fit to decide what the public should and shouldn't be exposed to, you're elevating yourself above them, that you're becoming their master whether they like it or not?

In both of these quotes you seem to be attacking the principle of criminal law, or of having laws. I assume you don't wish to do that. What you mean to do, presumably, is to say some things shouldn't be against the law which I think should be. You're not suggesting we do away with laws altogether are you? I mean, you could say that putting in jail the person who actually abducted this child would be making him ""suffer immensely in order to satisfy the desires of the wider group"". You could say that by thinking we're fit to decide it's not right for a child to be abducted, we're elevating ourselves above people who want to do that. So those arguments, which you've stated in a very general way, are out of place. Of course we need to be able to put some people in jail, and course we need to be able to decide upon laws. You can't attack those principles wholesale and use that as an attack against me, because you must subscribe to those principles too, unless you think that nothing should be a crime.

What you presumably mean to do is defend the right of people to be grossly offensive, and be racist. As if that is some kind of sacred principle, people's right to be offensive towards others, and to be racist towards others, and spread racist views publicly, to vilify innocent people, including children. You're saying, ""I demand the right to say whatever I want to whoever I want, to insult people's dead relatives if I so desire, to make racist comments at people in the street, to insult defenceless, innocent people with impunity, and never be forced to stop, no matter how offensive I decide to be"". That's what you're arguing for, that's what you're defending. You're saying that the right to do that is so important that it outweighs any emotional distress whatsoever in anyone, regardless of who they are, regardless of whether they're a child. To me, that's really arrogant. Demanding that pointless right, completely dismissing emotional distress of any kind. You are really, really arrogant and self-important.

It's not taking away anyone's important rights, to outlaw certain kinds of hateful speech. Why is ""destroying freedom of expression"" by banning hate speech any worse than ""destroying freedom of action"" by banning murder and rape? You have a misconception that insults, derogatory speech and hate speech can cause no harm, and that nobody could possibly need protecting from them, and also you have a misconception that these kinds of speech are somehow crucial to human nobility and individual liberty. They aren't. Freedom of expression is not destroyed, it's just limited, similar to how other laws limit our actions. Nothing important and vital is lost, no important freedoms are lost. It's not important to be allowed to be hateful and offensive in public. Why is that important? You haven't shown that that is important.

&gt;Ours laws should strive to create the ideal world, not cater to the worst aspects of human excess and emotional vitriol.

These are your words, specofdust, and I agree with them. Our laws should strive to create the ideal world. That is what I'm saying here, and yet you're accusing me of authoritarianism. But you said our laws should strive to create the ideal world. I don't think it's ideal to allow people to insult, offend and deride anybody, including grieving relatives, at will. I don't know how it creates an ideal world to argue we should be protecting people's right to do that, and be making it easier for them to do. It doesn't hurt them not to be able to do that, does it?

&gt;It clearly is, plenty of countries don't criminalise racial speech and yet racism has declined massively in some of those in the last 50 years (The US being a prime example).

OK, perhaps it's not necessary to criminalise racist speech. OK? I've conceded that. But at the same time, I don't think you've come up with a single good reason why it's important *not* to criminalise it. I don't see where the harm is in criminalising it, why it's more harmful than criminalising other undesirable acts. If you decide to reply to this comment, please make an effort to point out exactly what is the *harm* in making hate speech illegal. If someone is forbidden from making hateful speeches, from promoting hate, why is that *harmful* to them? And why is that more harmful than the harm they do with the hate speech, which I don't agree is no harm at all? Is racist speech really that valuable that we need to protect the ability to express it publicly? Can't racists be happy just expressing their racist views in private?",0,1349894932,null,0,1349906891,0,c6khv1w,t3_116vf0,t1_c6khv1w,t1_c6kebv7,null,1435678961,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I have ignored your point as it is both an appeal to authority and a 'slippery slope' argument. Your point has no merit, unless you can prove that religious freedom as I reference in one of my points will actually cause these ills. 

If this is indeed the case, that complete religious freedom will inevitably lead to these human rights abuses, you therefore accept that all religions must be controlled by the state, even to the point of making them essentially meaningless, in order to prevent these things. 

Is that a correct statement of your beliefs in the matter?

Honestly, one way or the other, atheists win and religious people lose, so it's all academic to me - which is why I am arguing both points while you state, frankly, that unless I agree with you, I must be in favour of ethnic cleansing - when you haven't even stated your beliefs on the matter for me to agree or disagree with except in the loosest possible terms. 

I am trying to 'drill down' to the fundamental philosophical underpinnings of your beliefs in this matter, and you respond with 'if you don't agree you must enjoy genocide,' which demonstrates an intellect that has not progressed past primary school, playground conversations.

It's just basically about Bates's prolonged hatred for LUST, and him trying to discredit them or get the fans turned against them.

It's mostly really exam-based. However we get a limited choice of Master's project (we chose from a list and then they doled them out pretty much randomly), I managed to get my first choice by swapping with my brother - it's okay: basically some maths in electomagnetism and then coding in Fortran to simulate the metamaterial superlens.

Metamaterials are more famous for the whole invisibility cloak thing so you've probably heard of them in the newspapers. It sounds more interesting than it actually is, when you just code it, plot it in MATLAB and it comes out some horrible mess and then you wonder why for ages as the code is pretty simple so whilst it could be a bug it's not that likely and it's more likely that the maths is wrong - which is far harder to fix :/

Nonsense, it is verifiable fact given that this is exactly what the laws you support actually do, and can be seen clearly in places like Singapore (lovely place to visit, by the way).

At what point does this 'extremism' start? Is it 'extremist' for an evangelical to tell a muslim that he is going to hell, and deserves to spend an eternity in torture? Who gets to describe if that is extreme or not? It certainly sounds extreme to me, yet many evangelical christians would baulk at the idea of not being permitted to do that.

By setting these limits on freedom of speech, you are - by definition - enforcing limits on religion and religious expression, even to a point where the religion would be considered effectively meaningless if the prescribed actions or expressions were prohibited.

Which suggests the problem is browser design - browsers should be designed to neither accept nor reject cookies by default, but to ask. This could even be site-by-site, so you'd get something like the Firefox NoScript plugin, but for cookies rather than scripts.

And now, with the no-cookies-without-consent rule, we seem to need something similar anyway - a way to remember that we rejected cookies on each site so the nags can be automatically disabled.

Though to be honest, the biggest issue I have with the nagging is that some sites say ""if you don't consent but keep returning, we'll eventually assume you consent anyway"".

Actually there is the whole computational physics area too - I have some books on that (I have books on everything thanks to LibraryGenesis :P ) and I also have some decent course notes from a course I had in Munich so maybe I should look at those.

The problem with writing an Android app is I don't have a smartphone which would presumably be of great use to test it on :P That idea of making the phone a remote is pretty cool though!

I might try making a crude color based aimbot (or triggerbot) for a simple fps as that shouldn't be too hard? For some simple fps like UrbanTerror or w.e. it's kind of joining 'the dark side' but it could be fun.

We've had similar ""separate but equal"" policies around the world. The southern states in America had ""separate but equal"" laws called [Jim Crow Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws). So if it's the case that same-sex couples should be happy with a separate but equal partnerships and shouldn't complain, when why weren't black people happy with separate toilets, or entrances to places? They still got the ""same thing"" at the end?

It's because it still says that one side is inferior to the other. It's a way of still telling them that they're lesser people while pretending that they're doing them a favour.

Don't forget - he's played, I think, 3 league games as a left back! He's much more comfortable in the CB position, it seems. 

He's been making every tackle and shutting down every player on his side of the field. 

I kind of hope that for Chelsea we swap Kaboul (he'll be back, right?) and Jan. Jan will shut down Hazard, while I'm a little worried about Kaboul's performance having just come off such a long injury.

So he can control some kinds of energy flow with a lot of concentration and obvious discomfort, but it doesn't go away – it's just transferred into another object.

No it doesn't. In order to know that, you'd need to know the speed.

&gt; If the other driver was going 30, he'd be 220 foot away (68 meters).

The other driver was apparently speeding though, so they were going more than 30, meaning the distance would be less, and decrease at a quicker rate. Like I said, it seems to me like lack of attention by the GF and she misjudged the speed of the car, or poor eyesight.

&gt;But we only have one account though, but based on how far away that tree is from the junction suggests he was going much faster than the posted limit.

I'm not suggesting the other driver wasn't speeding, I'm just saying she should have seen the car coming and waited for it to pass. For some reason, she failed to see it coming and turned out in front of it instead. That's probably why the police are asking her to go on the driving course.

The alternative is loan sharks.  You know those guys that beat the shit out of you for paying late or force their way into your house and take what they want and then add more debt?

There's several redditors that have used their services after being caught short.  Just because some muppets get caught continuing their death spiral into debt, doesn't mean these companies should be crippled or forced out of business.

Their rates are actually quote reasonable.  If you lend £100 then the rates , along similar lines you should pay a mate if they lend you £100.

There's an element of truth in that.

&gt; We commute for hours per.day, put in 12the hour shifts and take home a pittance, less than those who dont work.

Part of the proeblem is that the benefit system is too complicated and rates of withdrawal are sometimes greater than 100% which makes it possible for someone to be better off unemployed than working.

The fix would be to have a simple system. For each person calculate the amount of benefits they would get if they had no other income. Call that B.

As they earn other income (I), withdraw benefits at the stardard rate (R), so benefits received, BR = B - I*R.

Once BR&lt;0, they get no benefits but start paying tax, again at rate R.

The tax and benefits systems would be merged so there would be one bureaucracy instead of two, saving money.

(Alternately, you could have a citizens income of B, paid to everyone regardless of their circumstances and tax all income at R -- this amounts to the same thing, but administered differently).

This would mean that no-one would be better off not working than working.

Why don't they do this? There are lots of reasons, but one is that [most MPs are innumerate](http://meowc.at/message/170) -- put simply the fuckers are too fucking thick to do simple maths.

Nuclear reactors/parts are already o biggest export. We should expand this industry as it's only going to be in more demand going into the future. 

@David Cameron on the Paralympics:

That was actually kinda sweet. I hope he wasn't putting on the quivering voice. 

@Independence of Scotland:

Part of me feels we should let the referendum fail on its own rather than concede more stuff to Scotland. They already get a way better deal than England. Free Uni education and free NHS prescriptions. That's a £27K saving for people in Scotland before they're 22. What else are they going to want?

Well I hope they will be back by 2014, but he said 'almost all'. Is that really news? When will they all be out?

But that's the thing, there is no '10'. Yes, we often say 'The 10th Doctor' or 'The 8th Doctor' to distinguish between incarnations, but in all actuality there is not '10th Doctor'. It's just The Doctor, all one person. You can't say 'Well, that's just the way 10 felt about it', because he's still the same person who was the 9th Doctor, 8th Doctor, and so on.

And I think that's the heart of the matter. It's not whether 10's regeneration was poorly written, or anything else. It's that it was written to give the viewer the idea that 10/David Tennant is a separate person from 1/2/3/4/etc. and that he was indeed dying.

It really does need to be done, we have great contributors and great information and views that should be broadcasted.

I can edit the audio, create the graphics, help write and script part of the shows, I dont mind helping on the social media side, whatever...

SO, Im kinda going to be co-hijacking this project with OP

What Im going to do is get in contact with OP, arrange all the little bits and pieces and then were going to start scripting (some parts will need to be scripted to help the flow of the content) and creating all the extra bits of the podcast.

true,serenityunlimited,null,null,"I don't think the show is necessarily doomed.  They had good writing and great chemistry before, and it isn't always easy to get that with a new crew.  I still miss Nathan, though I still enjoyed the seasons without him.

I agree that a new crew offers the possibility for the show to really mix up their plots and introduce new elements, which is good.  It prevents stagnation.  I surely agree with this.

What has me less than entirely optimistic and restlessly eager is that with all these new changes, the show will have to do a very good job of bringing it all together.  I'm fairly sure they can, but it's possible the loss of characters, and potential flop of new members (I don't know the new members, so I can't say either way), makes it more risky.  I hope they excel.  I think the show could do awesome with a mostly new crew, add a lot of freshness to it, some awesome new powers, and to take them places they might not have gone before.

I'll certainly be tuning into at least a few episodes, to see how it plays out.  I really enjoy the show and its potential, so I'll give it its fair chance, absolutely.  Change isn't necessarily bad.  It can be the best thing that could happen, even.  We'll see how it goes.

I didn't mean to imply that the changes will ruin the show.  It's simply the loss of some of my favorite characters, and I'm not sure if the new cast will keep up.  I'm optimistic.  Perhaps not as excited as I could be, but optimistic.  I did get excited to see a 'teaser promo' the other day... but it just showed Rudy in the rain for about six seconds.

Very first project - ""Go out and do some research into &lt;subject matter&gt;"". So I come back with an illustrated document about the history and evolution of the subject matter, to find out that all we were supposed to do was find and print some pretty looking pictures and stick them onto brightly coloured cardboard.

We spent two months IN A FASHION CLASS making **stuffed dolls.**

When we actually did something related to fashion, the lecturers chose to teach us about Harajuku fashion and Japanese trends in general, and (because this is one of my major interests) got most of their information wrong to the point where I had to go and correct them privately. And give them some links and stuff to put on their learning resources for the rest of the class to use.

At the moment it's illegal to be as ""grossly offensive"" as Mr Woods was. The thing I'm taking issue with is, although a lot of people were very offended by him, everyone here on Reddit seems to be taking the incredibly arrogant approach of saying to those people that their offence counts for nothing, that it should simply be ignored. I'm pointing out that that's an unhelpful approach. We should at least acknowledge the outrage.

Like I said, I don't think the guy should have been jailed. I'm just repeating that because everybody taking issue with me wants to portray me as an insane authoritarian. I'm more of a realist. You can't just get rid of the law which led to Woods being jailed, and expect the emotional and psychological makeup of large numbers of people to then somehow magically change so that they no longer feel anger at things like this. If he hadn't been jailed, for example, there would still be a lot of anger against him, probably, and he'd be harrassed, there'd be campaigns against him. If we want to change the law so that people can be as grossly offensive as they want (although I haven't seen a decent justification for that anywhere here yet!), we'd first have to address how to deal with that anger. So I'm being more practical, more realistic, and also more inclusive than a lot of people here. OK? Practical, realistic, inclusive, in that *I'm taking account of the other side, not dismissing it*. By taking account of it, I'm *not* endorsing it.

The major problem here is that wind farms don't actually work. We have no way to store the energy when it is produced so lots of it is wasted. When its not windy since it is not stored we cannot rely on the wind power. So we need the rest of the power supply sources to stay intact these cannot be turned off / on at a moments notice.

Since the turbines normally cannot be located near the consumer of the power there is also transmission wastage. This also requires more energy to go into the construction of getting the power to where it needs to be.

Here is a couple of interesting facts that you may not be aware of.

The figure of 40% produced by wind turbines is using the maximum theoretical output of the wind farm. In reality this means 0%-20% since only in the correct conditions (very narrow wind range) will the maximums ever be reached.

Some wind farms in england during the last 2 winters have used more power than they have produced at times when we have needed power most eg during cold spells. Since the control unit's run on power and required the blades to be constantly turned into the wind.

Wind turbines have double the carbon footprint of a nuclear plant when taking construction into consideration. Note that nobody seems to consider destruction when they reach their 25 year lifetime. I am sure ""us"" the tax payer will pay for this in the end. Since we also pay for the construction of them in the first place.

By all means though chase the Tide turbines. So long as the moon exists it will continue to produce power reliably every single day with 30-60 minute gaps every 8 hours. At least it works in a predictable fashion that could be harnessed if giving some funding for further research and testing and reduces the problem of storage from indefinite to ""1 hour"" while the tide turns. Which is a reachable goal to be solved.

It's like the Rhohynol crap when the Met sent in a test team and - low and behold -  found that 25% of our randomly tested glasses had traces of Rhohynol on them, so they tried to shut us down. 

Utter crap, they were honestly trying to tell us that a large number of our clientele were spiking our drinks and using our premises to set up drug related rape? 

We successfully defended and kept our license mainly on the grounds of it being an utterly ridiculous claim considering we'd never had a case of anyone complaining that it had actually happened to them, and not one incident could be found from the bar CCTV of somebody maliciously adding a substance to someone else's drink. Not one. 




Also, we got on average about two or three sexual assaults per year and 99% of those where from a people too drunk the night before to remember a damn thing when it all boiled down to the facts. I know because I used to trawl through the CCTV, listen to their crap and fill in the incident book. Young people get drunk, get foolish, wake up the next morning and regret what they did the night before, it's as easy as that. Shutting down an establishment is not going to prevent that ever happening. 

There's also the inevitable girlfriend/boyfriend fights - usually when one gets caught cheating on the other - they get classed as sexual assaults too,  but they're not really rape, are they.

European Union Framework Decision for Combating Racism and Xenophobia (2007)

of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or 
ethnic origin.

- Publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising

- crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes as defined in the Statute 
of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) directed against a group of persons

Member States may choose to punish only conduct which is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order or which is threatening, abusive or insulting.

The reference to religion is intended to cover, at least, conduct which is a pretext for directing acts against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.

Only a minority of people get caught in a debt spiral.  They have the choice to not pay anything back, if it gets too much they can always declare bankruptcy, it's not like they have to worry about a poor credit rating is it.

I might actually support that ill thought out petition if the cap on APR was something like 10,000%.  Since the margins are razor thin as they are, so it's only fair that the companies should have some room to maneuver.  That and a maximum limit one can end up owing per £100.

This is by far the neatest way to wrap up the story and have Amy and Rory's story end once and for all.

I have always HATED mentions of Christmas in shops before the 1st of December.

However... Now I run a small business. We have been receiving Christmas material from our suppliers since August or September (after Summer, the next big promotional hook is Christmas). When all the other shops advertise Christmas, there's a certain pressure to do it yourself - you don't want to feel you're missing out on catching potential customers early. You've also got to prepare stock orders months in advance, especially with things selling out supplier-side, so you can't help but be thinking about it.

It's hideous mutual reinforcement across the entire retail industry. I'd be happy if we (the retail sector) could all just agree 'no mention of Christmas until November. Then we can start talking about it as a future event, but no decorations, colour-schemes or Christmas music until December'.

On the plus side, I don't have a PRS license - I play music by small local bands - so I don't (couldn't even if I wanted to) play all that horrible Christmas music.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Let me tell you the story of one girl who cried rape at my club ( one of a few, but this one is interesting because it was all on CCTV ) 

OK, Sunday afternoon after a packed weekend I get a call from the police asking if they could come and see me as some girl had been raped in the back alley. Yeah, no problem. 

The police came to the club on Monday evening, we sit down and they tell me the story; this girl had been pulled into the back alley against her own free will, assaulted by some bloke who'd then ripped her skirt off and tried to rape her. She'd fought him off, sobered up, remembered what had happened the next day and called the police.

OK, as far as she was concerned this was - in her mind - unequivocal rape. 

The CCTV however told a completely different story. She got drunk with this guy, they'd been all over each other all night, left the club *together*, and as the CCTV showed had gone into the alley behind the club *together,* ( the alley was also covered by CCTV )  spent a good 30 mins snogging before he'd stuck his hand up her skirt hoping to ""cop off."" She then drunkenly slapped him, he fell over and in the process had ripped her skirt. He put his hands in the air in a kind of ""OK, sorry, I thought... "" kind of way and she kicked out at him a couple of times. They both then parted company. He staggered off, she sat on the bench outside of the club and cried a bit. She was approached by security who asked her what had happened and - according to them - she screamed ""Fuck off, you're all bastards"" before running off into the night.

She however was absolutely convinced she'd been raped. 

Not rape. More a bit of stupid fumbling from two people who'd had too much to drink, wouldn't you agree?

And this kind of thing happens all the time because people are too drunk to really know or remember what went on. 

Now it's all good you morally getting on your high horse and going on about people not making decisions like that when they're drunk, but they do, it's a fact of life. 

People get drunk and do stupid stuff they can't remember the next day. 

Rape does inevitably happen of course, I'm not saying for one minute it doesn't, but when it comes to clubs and drunks most of the time people just can't remember what the fuck happened and reach their own conclusion. 

Regret sex or attempted drunken sex is therefore IMO, not rape.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"The economy. The UK actually isn't doing that badly in the scheme of things. We've cut the deficit by 25% in two years.. that's not bad going. It's going to better in the long term for the good of the country. And creating more private sector jobs in the last two years than Labour managed over 10 years. I'd love to see that fact-checked, because it's an impressive statistic if it's true. We are greatly affected by Europe and he's also right that we can't just keep on borrowing money from other countries - it's a neverending cycle which leads to huge problems. 

Taxes. I like his statement that money that someone has earned belongs to THEM. A tax cut isn't ""writing a cheque"" - it's letting someone keop their OWN money. I'd also like to see his statement about the rich paying more each year under the conservatives fact-checked. Again, that dismisses quite a few notions about ""tory cunts"" too.

Energy. What he said about world leader in tidal power, wind power etc sounds great. I'd love to see stats - I thought Germany was leading the charge with this?

Exports - exports to china, russia etc up by huge percentages. First surplus in the UK car industry for 40 years. Sounds excellent - I want that fact-checked too.

What he said about planning permissions and house-building and home ownership is common sense too. We need to preserve our countryside, but we need to encourage business and help people to own houses. It is ridiculous to lose out on new buildings and jobs because of planning permission, and ridiculous that we don't have affordable houses because of NIMBYs. I would love to see actual numbers with his promises laid out.

Welfare. I seriously agree with what he says around the 18 minute mark. The conservatives aren't the party of the better off - they're the party of the people who WANT to be better off, and I don't think we should be ashamed of that. I liked what he said around 46 minutes - ""we aren't about preserving privilege. We're about spreading it."" It's right to help people to help themselves, but not to do things for them - that doesn't actually help anybody. Leading a country with massive dependence on government isn't a healthy long-term strategy. And while people living in expensive houses for free that working people can't afford isn't a major problem, it's still something worth dealing with.

New program spending up to £14,000 per person to get them into work sounds fantastic. 700,000 people helped by this already. I'd love to see stats because it sounds excellent.

What he says about schools is absolutely true. Discipline, high standards, school uniforms, teachers wearing suits and strict enforcement of rules with no excuses is needed. We kinda laugh at China for their 12hr school days and military discipline, but their kids are unbelievably educated compared to ours.",0,1349959373,null,0,false,0,c6kv97b,t3_119q49,t1_c6kv97b,t3_119q49,null,1430120045,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

My understanding of QE is that it basically tries to 'trick' the market into thinking the economy is healthier than it really is.

This in turn makes the economy look healthier than it is, due to higher asset prices.

In which case, my question is, what in the fucking fuck is the point of this.  The 'market' isn't an idiot (though only just as far as I can tell), surely it knows that QE is going on, and therefore it knows that asset prices are artifically high, and that the risk in the market hasn't been lessened by this.

In the UK, you'd have to find the money to pay off the loan (maybe by selling the car).

Whether this works for you depends on the amount you've paid so far, and the value of the car; in practice, it means that Sharia banks ask for a decent deposit when lending you money for a car, so that if you return the car within a month, they've got a good chance of making their money.

On top of that, Sharia allows for non-Muslims like me; what I've described is the stricter form of Sharia, which only applies if the borrower or lender is Muslim; if both borrower and lender are non-Muslim, Sharia accepts that they can lend each other money for ""reasonable"" interest.

true,Dirk_McAwesome,uk,Norwich/Coventry,"More stimulus is definitely necessary and the right answer but I disagree that banks benefit from QE. I'll do my best to give an explanation of my view on QE and interest rates. Please reply and ask if anything is unclear and I'm sorry if any of it seems basic or patronising.

Market interest rates are the rates at which institutions are willing to lead to each other for various lengths of time. Short term interest rates are lower than longer term interest rates because of lenders' desire for flexibility and fear of inflation or default. [Here's an example yield curve](http://www.fxwords.com/images/words/basic_yield_curve.jpg) (interest rates over different time periods) diagram. Higher interest rates mean less inflation in an overheating economy and lower interest rates mean more demand in a recessionary economy.

The Bank of England normally does monetary policy by swapping very short-term government debt for cash until short-term interest rates are equal to it's target rate (which it sets every month). Now that short-term interest rates are near-zero and can't really go any lower (negative nominal interest rates on very short-term debt are impossible because people will choose to simply hold cash instead) QE is an attempt to do exactly the same thing to longer-term interest rates. £375bn of QE means that £375bn of government debt held by banks has been swapped for £375bn of cash. This is much harder than short-term monetary policy since the Bank of England must credibly commit to hold to a similar policy for months or years at a time rather than hours or days at a time.

How does this affect banks? A big way in which banks make money is by borrowing short-term debt at low interest rates (such as current account deposits) and lending long term debt at high interest rates (such as mortgages). They make their money off the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. QE makes these more similar to each other and so decreases the banks' margins.

Just look at the massive objections to QE from banks and bankers in the USA for proof of this. Creditors (holders of other people's debts) are the people who benefit most from hard, non-inflating money and banks are the biggest creditors around.",0,1349961228,null,0,1349969525,0,c6kvjlu,t3_11awme,t1_c6kvjlu,t3_11awme,null,1430120182,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I think even recently there was a TV show that made it look like those who thought it was a conspiracy at one time no longer thought it was, so that the general public will think that it's been debunked.

One of the group was going for an 'oriental' look of some kind, chopsticks in hair, silk dressing gown/gofuku/kimono some kind of parasol etc. We slowed down because my partner wanted to get a good view of how she did her make up and as we passed from behind we found out, she hadn't gone for a Chinese princess look or a Japanese geisha but instead had slapped on what looked like a face-full of sunshine yellow poster paint and some black makeup to slant her eyes.  
My partner had a good laugh at that but got plenty of 'that's terrible' when we met up with the Jewish family we were on the way to to have a quick talk about a project.

true,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,"I think it boils down to dislike of 2 things:

1) Trick or treating.

2) The over commercialisation.

Trick or treating is obviously annoying in the extreme to those who don't want people knocking on their doors, and the 'Opt out' suggestion is arse-about-face imho. It ought to be 'opt in', whereby people who want to participate could display a carved lantern or whatever to indicate they have stuff to hand out.

The over commercialisation is the sort of thing that happens when people buy into it. My kids have, as kids do, and I'm a grouchy old git who really doesn't. So if they want to spend their pocket money on halloween themed tat, that's up to them, but when they pester for such stuff, I make it clear I'll help them carve lanterns, but I draw the line at disposable plastic shite. If people don't like the over commercialisation, then they shouldn't buy into it. Simple as. But if other's want to festoon themselves and their houses with placcy skulls, bats and witchy crap, then by all means, feel free.

There is another group of objectors I'm aware of, as my missus has a few pals who are card carrying paganists, and they get all het up about the appropriation of 'their' festival. Can't see it myself, I'd have thought they'd jump at the chance to get their hand on some inexpensive witchy-tat :)

First:  In your timeline you mention that old Rory sees old Amy in the hotel and creates a fixed point in time.  However, this all happens inside the paradox that Rory creates when he falls to his death (with Amy).  From everything we know about paradoxes in the Doctor Who universe, the universe resets to the point before the paradox existed.  If you recall, Martha, after the paradox the Master created, mentions that while she and her family remember the events of that year, no-one else seems to, and the Doctor clarifies that it was likely because they were at the epicenter.  If you apply the same logic to the paradox in TATM, it's likely Amy and Rory remember seeing the elderly Rory die, but that particular event never would have happened due to the universe phasing out the events of the paradox.

Second: The tombstone would not have logically been engraved with two peoples' names on it had Amy and Rory not found each other.  If the angels' hotel still existed, i don't think any predators are sentimental enough to bury two pieces of their food source together. if Amy and Rory didn't meet back up, that would mean Rory had Amy's name engraved on his tombstone, which is creepy.

Third: Rory is Amy's world.  And Amy is Rory's.  This is made pretty evident throughout seasons 5, 6 &amp; 7.  Rory waits 2000 years for Amy. Amy sacrifices her life three times to be with Rory.  I could go on, but the point is I don't think Amy would use the word ""full"" in describing her life if Rory was not in it.

The problem is the avenues of investment* do not have a return on investment large enough to justify borrowing. The banks do not know how to differentiate between the multitudes of businesses. There are many that ran loan check to loan check. Borrowing to grow to pay off what they borrowed ad infinitum. There are some that borrowed reasonably. The banks can't tell them apart. The money made from the reasonable borrowers has to outweigh the losses on the reckless ones.

The banks will need to borrow at -5% say before they can justify such an investment. At that point they are better off just holding onto the money. This is why the government needs to get involved. It can make sense for government to take a bad investment decision to pump money into the economy. They just cannot use the banks to do this.

Yeah - as opposed to all those people who want to be worse off!

It's just another useless political speech with all style and no substance whilst they carry on doing whatever the donors want - Miliband and Clegg are just as bad.

As for education - I've worked with other science students from all over the world on international research internships and the UK is actually pretty decent - we learn stuff much younger than many other countries as we don't have any national service and we focus much more at A level and graduate from university younger than many European countries.

As for China - they cram a lot but I'm not sure how much actual learning, as opposed to learning to pass tests, is done - and yes the two are massively different. The skills required to think up or build upon an R&amp;D project and see it through to fruition are quite different to those required to get past some exams.

That said the UK does have a slight deficiency in maths education (mainly because Further Maths isn't compulsory at A level and our University courses seem less mathematical than those of some other countries).

I guess I'm talking about the UK students that make it to uni and study STEM with good grades though - I think a downside to our specialisation is that if you try hard and do well, then you can really gain an advantage from learning a lot whilst still young, but if you fuck up - then you can fail _hard_ and quite easily end up as a NEET with no real prospects. Which seems less possible in countries with broader education and opportunities like the German system or the Scandinavian system.

School uniforms etc. is just BS though - if they want to really have improvements they should increase the school hours, private schools have far longer hours, with the time set aside for enrichment activities or private study. When kids spend far longer at home or wandering the streets than in school, the schools can only be expected to do so much.

The moulding detail was drawn onto a piece of balsa with a pencil and then cut out with a #2 knife. I then glued the moulding wall onto a piece of basswood for strength. Gluing that wall onto two of the main columns completed the entire side. Multiply that by four and you've got most of the TARDIS complete. The windows were done by cutting a hole into the moulding wall and using some 1mm balsa pieces to create the framing inside of the window. There is a single piece that runs horizontal and four pieces running vertically. These were sanded down flush with the inside of the walls and a piece of clear plastic was glued to each window. The frost was done with a can of Testors Dullcote applied inside and out. 

The top is pretty self explanatory, I just used varying thicknesses of balsa and basswood to build it up. I went with an old design and didn't taper the top of the roof. The lamp on top is a cap from a calligraphy pen I found at Hobby Lobby. I cut it to size using a scrollsaw and sanded the top and bottom smooth. The frosting was again done with some Dullcote. The frame of the lamp is just balsa cut and sanded to design. A 1/4"" hole was drilled through the top and a Radio Shack LED mount was glued in. A blue LED was run through and wired to a 555 timer circuit located inside and run to a 9V battery. A microswitch was mounted to the backside out of sight. 

After all was said and done, I used some Aerogloss Sanding Sealer and laid down two coats after a few sanding runs. After the sealer, I sanded everything smooth and applied a black Krylon primer. Sanded again, then laid on three coats of Krylon Oxford Blue in Satin. The black primer came through nicely and gives it an aged look. After that, I sprayed a couple of coats of Dullcote over the entire model to protect the paint and remove the gloss. I've been told that Dullcote has a habit of yellowing after years of UV exposure, but I figured this won't be an issue with the underlying color. 

The lettering is a self-adhesive vinyl cutout done using a Silhouette Cameo (pain in the ass, btw). The panel where the phone is located is just an inkjet print on some matte photo paper. Both again coated with Dullcote to protect them. 

I hope this helps if you decide to build. Keep in mind that I have almost zero woodworking experience and minimal model building experience. I think with the dedication and a steady hand, anyone can do this. I'll try and get a CAD drawing together at some point to help others with the process.

I'm not sure if patronising is quite the right word but I think I know what you mean.

To me, he's a bit, well, cheesy. Everything seems to be big or grand or epic. Everything he says seems to have such deep philosophical weight to it as if he were out of a JRR Tolkien novel or something.

In my opinion, and I'm guilty of it too, I think there is a general cynicism in this world that doesn't respond well to this sort of *big* and *romantic* notion of competition and football and Life.

So, here comes Rodgers with his Shankly-esque quotes. And while Shankly's words have had the luxury of time, nostalgia, romanticism, Rodgers' words and motivational techniques seem outdated in this modern world.

But ... I've come to *believe* him and all of his words and motivational techniques. And it looks like the players are responding to him too. Each match shows an increasing level of desire, hunger, improvement.

In the UK freedom of speech doesn't mean you can be as offensive as you like. [We don't have unrestricted free speech, and never have. But we do allow 'free' speech.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country#United_Kingdom) America allows unrestricted free speech and that's what people are getting confused with and thinking we have in the UK, because that's the version we hear about in popular culture all the time. 

**In the UK, in every circumstance you're free to express your point without being offensive.** People can express their views in well thought out and meaningful ways, not in a way that serves no purpose and is purely to offend. *That's* what's legal, and it's perfectly reasonable.

&gt;Edit: From a response to someone else, using a different topic as an example:
&gt;
&gt;I'm gay, and if someone goes around saying ""Faggots are disgusting. It's sick and wrong. You'll all rot in hell."" etc, I'd take offence, and most people could see that's offensive. The way it was expressed is naturally uninformative, and so offensive.
&gt;
&gt;But if someone goes around saying ""I disagree with homosexuality because my God forbids it, I believe we were put on this planet to reproduce."" etc, it informs others of their view in a peaceful way, with points of reason to back it up, ultimately expanding our understanding of why that person has that opinion. I don't agree, but I'm not offended and they have the right to express that view. *That's* free speech - and that's what's legal in the UK.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah it's subjective, but the context, meaning behind it, manner it was expressed, intention behind it (was it to peacefully inform others and help people understand each other?) etc all factor in. One is offensive, the other isn't. This guy was blatantly offensive.
