Correct. And what are said company going to do with the open source product? fork it? Unlikely. They'll stick off trunk, probably updating after releases or RCs. They can provide no firm guarantee about what goes into their codebase because what they pull is controlled by non company employees.

true,irishsandman,tennant,Tennant,"while I certainly commend you for your opinion and thorough explanation, I still find both the original set and yours to both feel *wrong.* Although both of you made some great choices. Real quick, props to the artist. Good clay (?) work. I do like your choices better though, so I thought I'd post some tweaks.

I don't like that the Knights don't match in the original (even though Jack/Boe is kind of a match that I could live with). if you're playing with someone knew to either Chess or Who (or *both*) they won't differentiate which piece is what halfway through the game. I also think your interpretation (although I love how logical it is) doesn't pay enough service to popular characters, which would cause the set to sell.

My .02:

Black Side-

* Black King could be The Master. I'm not psyched about this choice, but I personally think Daleks as pawns is brilliant because they are scarier in larger numbers. It fits more as a Whovian decision than a Chess-based one, to me. Davros could be the Black King, too, in that sense, but I don't know if he has the ""pull"" of The Master.

* Black Queen - This makes me realize that The Doctor has few female adversaries. I almost want to say a version of River Song would almost fit. The Rani? Too obscure to modern fans. Harriet Jones? Not really evil enough. 

* I think the Angels would be a good choice for Bishops, I agree. 

* Knights - Clerics are probably the best choice, but Weeping Angels are more popular.

* Rooks - Cybermen, I agree again.

* Pawns - Daleks, it's just creepier to see 8 of them coming at you.

White Side-

* King - The Doctor (while the 10th is my favorite, the 11th IS The Doctor right now, so he wins). 

* Queen - The TARDIS. It can move in any direction, any number of spaces. It's female. 

* Bishops - The Ood. They sort of revere The Doctor in a way that makes sense to me. 

* Knights - You suggested it, i'll say UNIT pieces.

* Rooks - K-9, I'll agree again.

* Pawns - okay so this is weird because I said I hated the multiple character choices, but I'd make them all the same/smaller size. I want the companions of The Doctor as pawns.

We have it easy, we live in a world where the main language is English really, yes there's the Chinese thing but we're going to ignore them. The main language taught as a foreign language is English too, because English is needed by people in every country of the world. It's comfortable and easy for us to not bother learning foreign languages because most of us don't need to. 

Secondly there is the teaching in our schools. Unless things have changed drastically in the last 15 or so years since I was at school, the teaching of foreign languages is pretty damn poor. The first thing a teacher of a foreign language needs to do is to show the student how to split up grammar and vocabulary and then you can go from there. It doesn't take long to get a good grasp of even the most complicated grammar (even Russian is quite fun with the cases it has and all the endings it adds to nouns, verbs and adjectives when required) and that is THE main basis for language. Get that out of the way and all you're left with is learning words, that's it. 

The way it was done when I was at school was that it was all lumped together and rather than telling us why the verb changed, they just told us that's the way it was, they did it so bloody slowly that after 5 years of secondary school I still didn't know all of the main French grammar, seriously grammar is the building block of all language and is the most important thing. Rather than drip feed people grammar piece by tiny piece, they need to get smashed in the face with it. Yes it's a bit of a shock but once they get over that they can just practice practice practice, they can then spend their time learning more and more vocab and improving as foreign language speakers. 

Another important thing to teach them, or at least advise them, is the best way to retain information. We all have our personal favourite ways of remembering stuff, I personally learn foreign words using flash cards with the foreign word on one side and the english word on the other. Some go in straight away and others take time, so the ones I struggle with go in my daily flash card list until they're well in my brain. We need to teach our kids actually how to learn, or at least show them all the options they have or might like so that they can see for themselves what works for them. In my opinion the best thing a teacher can do for any child is this, show them the different ways of learning and retaining information and help them find the one that's for them. 

I had terrible language teachers at school, and when I took my options they told me I shouldn't take German because I wasn't good enough at languages to manage it along with French. I got my A at GCSE only because six months before the exams I sat down and decided to work out all the rules etc myself, and when I did I just flew through the exams. I came out of school knowing more French grammar than I knew English grammar, knowledge of our own grammar is essential to foreign language learning too, and when schools just don't teach it properly, it's going to be harder to learn foreign languages. 

I  have been a professional linguist/interpreter for around 15 years now and recently spent six months of this year interpreting in Afghanistan.

We are all capable of learning foreign languages to a decent level, we're just put off by other factors. 

tl;dr - We have it easy and don't need to. Our language teaching at schools and universities is poor. People need to learn how to learn.

It seems to me that portions of regeneration are deliberate, or at the very least not random. The Doctor is not a completely new person each time, but he has a new body and some new quirks to his personality. 

Like I said above, [spoiler](/s ""River/Mels"") states ""I'm focusing on a dress size"". This has led me to a single conclusion, that is once again my own interpretation. I think that regeneration is such a large undertaking, no Time Lord can fully determine the outcome. They simply single in on certain aspects of themselves they wish to remain the same/change. The rest of the process is either random reconfiguration (resulting in new bodies and personalities) or essentially default to that person-i.e. the things so ingrained in them they stay without conscious thought.

What would getting rid of the monarchy really change? As far as I know they pretty much pay their way with both tourism and income from their estates going straight to the treasury, so there would be no financial gain. 

They dont have any political power so we wouldn't gain anything there.

Legally if they ever stopped being royal their estates would still belong to them and they would keep profits from those so it's not like they'd suddenly be one of us. Some would say they have no right to those estates but legally they are theirs.

So never accept a caution if you didn't do whatever it was your accused of, but a FPN is a case of doing a cost benefit analysis. 

From a bit of googling it would appear that FPN's only come up during the enhanced checks, under the non-convictions section, and is dependent on the officer thinking it's relevant for the job your interested in. So if you got a FPN for wearing a traffic cone and dancing in the street 5 years ago during freshers it's less likely to show up on your record than if you got one for spitting and cursing at a cop last week. 

Still not great to have one though, I'll agree, but I don't think it's a case of game-over for your career if you pay it.

I think this is disgusting - it's basically ""cheap justice"" if you can afford to pay it. Paying the ticket is basically a ""get out of jail free"" card - there are practically no repercussions if you accept the penalty.

If you can afford to say ""meh, it's only 80 quid"" then that's the end of it, as long as you don't get nicked again for a similar offence within the next year or so. If you do have another run in with them in that period then next time they'll charge you, instead, but if it's more than a couple of years, they'll just dish out another bogus ticket like this one again.

I spoke to 2 solicitors when this happened to me, and they both told me the cops pull shit like this all the time, and that they routinely lie and perjure themselves. If you refuse to accept the ticket you'll end up in court, and that the magistrate *will* believe them. 

I feel quite violated by my experience - 2 years later I still feel angry about it. It gives me a lot of sympathy for kids from the shitty areas of London who are stop-and-searched all the time, and for how minorities may be treated by the law.

You don't realise how bent the cops are until it happens to you.

*EDIT: also, when you're arrested your DNA is taken and stored in the national database.

Want to know how much of a joke it is here? One example of a royal mail worker who was caught after having stolen 130,000 items and stashed them away in his house... 2 years! Seriously? They should have given him 2 years PER ITEM. That shit is just ridiculous.

Surely the knowledge that 300 people are caught stealing from within the system and having a 10 year prison sentence on top for even a single offense would pretty much stop anyone but the absolute dumbest people from even thinking about it.

Instead, we've got a what I'd call a gaping hole in quality service forward.  The rest of Chelsea's midfield are decent, but they're not creative enough to provide those sexy through-balls that we've seen Mata serve time and time again (and more recently Torres).

The problem for Torres is that, now that he's finally gotten back on to the pitch, he's finding himself providing the service, rather than receiving it.  This is a huge problem, because if he doesn't start netting some goals, he will most certainly get benched when Drogba returns from the African Cup of Nations, and at that point, Torres' window of opportunity to prove himself will have closed and he'll be traded.

4. Now, you have a choice of grilling or broiling your bangers or frying. Throw them on low heat with the simmering bacon and onions (or in the cold pan, as the TV lady said, and add the onions and bacon in a bit) and let the fuckers rock gently, turning every few minutes.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"I've read studies regarding this before, and yes you are right, however that is only true when all other things are equal. Value of what is to be gained against what the potential punishment is if caught does also have an effect, and it can sometimes be quite pronounced.

Unfortunately increasing the number of people caught is quite difficult given the system. They already do almost as much as they can in that respect, and they do punish harshly and swiftly as a company. But given all that, what I suggested with regards to the law itself is really the easiest way to further stem the problem.

To take this to an extreme with a thought experiment... if there was a death sentence for opening a jar of peanut butter - would you risk doing it in the privacy of your own kitchen considering the unlikelihood that anyone would find out?

If there was just a 10p fine for doing so, would you be more likely to open the jar? Chances of getting caught are exactly equal here...

In this case I think a harsh penalty is also justified - if you steal 100 items of mail you could be stealing from as many as 100 people, that's 100 counts of theft with utter disregard for 100 people. Crimes are generally considered worse when you're placed in a position of trust of other peoples stuff, too - these people aren't stealing out of necessity.

She needed concentration in order to control her regeneration. She, based on the quote, was working quite hard on controlling the regeneration, but still ran to the mirror afterwards to see what she looked like. 

From the same episode, after regenerating:
&gt;Right, let's see, then. Ooh, it's all going on down there, isn't it? The hair! (runs to a mirror) Oh! The hair, it just doesn't stop, does it? Look at that! Everything changes! Oh, but I love it, I love it!(faces the others) I'm all sort of... mature!

She had control over some aspects of her regeneration, which only could happen if she maintained focus, but still had things that were a surprise to her after regeneration. 

Now, we have multiple characters who regenerate throughout the history of the show-i.e. Romana, The Master, The Doctor, [spoiler](/s ""River""), and finally Corsair. And Corsair is the only one who changes gender that we know of. It supports (yes, I know it's not necessarily the case) the idea that changing gender is done willfully rather than randomly, especially since he/she is touted and changing between male and female multiple times.

But going back a step, haha @ your edit :D

And no, for people who steal because they are poor, addicts, etc. then harsh punishments are not so fair.

As I've said regarding postal workers stealing mainly, they are employed and in a position of trust to handle other peoples items. They sign some scary stuff when they get the job and they should receive an extremely harsh punishment if they break that. Stealing 130,000 items and spending 2 years in prison makes that entire thing look like a joke - which it is. I can see why so many items go ""missing"" in the post, it's because we're apparently all quite happy for postmen to steal stuff from us with little in the way of repercussions.

But yea, as I've also said, you do have to take the area into account when it comes to leaving items, and you can't really leave stuff outside here due to the weather so it would have to be in a porch, bin, etc. anyway.

Still, the maximum sentence being massive for stealing post would act as a deterrent to postal workers as they will know that they will never have a good enough excuse for it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;decades of UK government under-spending in Scotland on **defence** and on other items which are not routinely broken down by region, such as foreign office services.

What? Has Scotland been invaded by Norway without someone telling me?

&gt;Second, there's the claim that Scotland's **""bloated""** welfare state could not be sustained outside the Union. This is nonsense. Including its per capita share of revenues from North Sea oil and gas production, Scotland's public expenditure probably does not exceed the OECD average and is almost certainly lower than that of the Scandinavian social democracies.

I'm not sure it's fair to pretend your quoting someone, it's the definition of a straw man argument. Also you've given absolutely no figures or sources here.

&gt;It wouldn't, of course, but according to George Walker, professor of financial regulation and policy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland would only have had to take on a proportion of the total cost of the bail-out based on the subsidiaries and business operations of HBOS and RBS in Scotland. This would probably amount to no more than 5 per cent.

I'm calling bullshit on that. Ireland didn't get whatever get out jail free card that you think exists.

&gt;But why should Unionists let the economic facts ruin the image they have built up of Scotland as a nation of selfish, indulged welfare **""mendicants""**? 

Again quoting no one. This is something that really bother me about nationalists you're so keen to create a phantom image of an oppressor. 

&gt;The subsidy myth is too politically useful to be simply abandoned.

Politically useful to whom, exactly? Useful to the Tories in their quest to weaken their share of the UK vote? Useful to Labour to show how they have overspent on their traditional homeland? Come off it.

The UK Government does not have it in for Scotland. People in Scotland pay the same in terms of tax as everyone else but get more out of it both in terms of a stronger welfare state and in terms of a more democratic system of government and over representation at Westminister than anyone else. 

Stop being a hater.

In a frying pan or griddle on max heat - brown the sausages all over - this should only take a couple of minutes if the pan is hot enough. Once they're brown, turn the heat down as low as it will go &amp; leave the sausages in there for at least 30 minutes - turning occasionally.  
  
While the sausages are cooking - slice an onion into rings &amp; then again so you end up with half rings - fry very slowly in a pan with a little butter until the onions are caramelised (now is an ideal time to peel the spuds &amp; put them on to boil). When the onions are done - add them into your gravy (I tend to use Bisto if I don't have any 'real' beef gravy left over from the Sunday roast).  
  
Then, this is the genius bit, add a tin of (Heinz) baked beans into the gravy/onions &amp; add the whole lot to the sausages for the last 10 minutes of the sausages cooking time.  
  
Here's the important bit - **MASH THE POTATOES PROPERLY** - do not leave any lumps - they should be smooth - if you leave lumps in your mashed potato, *I'm gonna call a coupla hard, pipe-hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on you with a pair of pliers and a blow torch*. Once mashed, add butter (never margarine) &amp; milk to taste.  
  
Now it's time to serve - make a mountain of mash in the middle of the plate &amp; surround it with sausages - at least 3, maybe 4 if you have a healthy appetite. Then pour as much of the beany, oniony, beefy gravy over the top as the plate will handle.

Let's see, I've got Luiz and Lamps pencilled in as DM's in a double pivot, Torres above as an attacking mid. JT at CF (he's good at getting his head on crosses), Ramires at RB (we need a RB that can defend and also complement the attack). Sturridge and Lukaku at CB (we need more pace at the back but you still need at least one strong CB, AVB also wants CBs who can play with the ball at their feet so this is an improvement). Not sure about the rest of the side we'll probably have to buy some more players to play out of position (maybe Eden Hazard at LB and Cahill in goal).

true,Socks_In_The_Mirror,silence,Silence,"I think I agree with this post the best, even with moderate changes. When making a chess set you should consider both state vs. church but also the position of importance. Since there seems to be a very medieval feel here the feudal system seems appropriate. The king/queen would be the monarchs/lords (king and queen make sense as a monarch, but honestly the lords had more power than the monarchs), the bishops/knights/rooks would be the vassals (vassals were commonly knights), and the pawns would be the serfs. Also, you need to consider what special qualities each position has.

PSBlake did a good job on the church vs. state debate, but the Tardis would never be a pawn.

Black Queen: I think the placement of Cassandra was acceptable, but she still seems pretty irrelevant. Although I hate the Slitheen, since they have been in the most episodes, and the main Slitheen was a girl, it may make the most sense to have a Slitheen holding the Margaret Blaine suit.

Black Knights: You put Weeping Angels, but they're already the bishops. I say the Daleks, since they're warriors (kind of) and they also fit very well with the nature vs. technology, them having a tough outer armor but a very soft and living inside.

Black Pawns: The Sontarans. BraddiganEccleston made a good point about them having a weak spot on the back of their necks, and since pawns can only move forwards, it makes sense for the Sontarans to be pawns. Moreover, they're whole purpose is to be used and die in a fight, to be sacrificed, and pawns are very sacrificial.

White Queen: I'm iffy on this one. I feel as if the queen should be a human, making me think River Song, but the Tardis has been with the Doctor his whole travels, and the Tardis certainly is a female entity.

White Bishops: The clerics.

White Knights: The Tardis, which I guess means River is the queen.

White Pawns: The Ood. Having so many different pawns would be confusing, the the Ood make great pawns. First, it makes sense for there to be 8 of them, and second, they spent most of their lives in slavery.

Edit: I just realized that the Silence should be in there somewhere. Also, reading this thread, I realize Kovarian would make a much better black queen.

Benitez was predictable (subs on the hour every game). I recognise advantage of rotation when a player is not on a good streak but rotating when they are on a good streak is silly;kills confidence and that is what Benitez did. 

He was very politically open, the Liverpool way is to deal with it behind closed doors and he dragged the politics into the open and made us a laughing stock. 

Redknapp is really good on the transfer market and has consistantly signed great players either young (Bale) or Bargain (Van Der Vaart). He has an honest style that would suit Liverpool well and he plays entertaining football.

Mourinho is a man of style, he wants to win what ever the cost and he is teh man in charge, player power is kept very low. I love his arrogance and swagger and I would be very happy to see him as our gaffer.

All this said i'm not shouting for Daglish's head yet at all.

Canadian accents can be a teensy bit different than US American ones, but often they are close.  I like Dead Like Me, Forever Knight, and Lexx, all are scifi/horror shows, though they can get dark and cynical, which can be depressing.  The Red Green Show is very funny, if you like Monty Python you will like it too. 

 For US American shows, The Twilight Zone (Rod Serling's original in black and white) and The West Wing are certainly well-crafted, and enjoyable for Whovian tastes.  I've heard good things about BSG too, but have not seen any of it, and it might not work to only watch one or two episodes, where it would with TZ and TWW.  

Out of curiosity, could you make a recording of your ""really wrong"" accent for us and for science?  I am so fascinated by that kind of thing, and i'll bet your accent would sound really cool.

true,OKsoIneedAnAccount,lfc12,,"I have to disagree with just about everything you just said

First, it's Adam not Adams. 

Second, spending: The transfer fees for those players you listed, does not add up to £100M (Carroll £35M, Adam £7.5M, Downing £20M, Henderson £20M £82.5).

In fact, if you look at the overall transfers, you'll find that they actually spent very conservatively. Yes, Carroll was expensive, but don't forget that that price was jacked up tremendously because of the Torres sale, and the scramble to replace him in the last few days of the transfer window. In case you didn't know, the price for Torres was set to ""Carroll plus £15M"" by the owners. In reality Torres was probably worth £20-30M in the form he was in, that makes the value the club saw in Carroll about £10-15M which is reasonable for him. So what if Chelsea paid the difference?

The summer spending was significant, yes, but they also sold players for over £20M to make up for it. Meireles, Ngog the most noticeable, along with Babel who was sold in the January window.

Overall net spending was just under £40M for the January and summer transfer window combined. 

Equally, if not more important: They reduced the monthly payroll significantly by offloading players line Jovanovic who didn't even make the bench, but was collecting £100K a week. Joe Cole also was making £100K/week. Conchesky and Poulsen, two player that also barely made the bench under Dalglish, were another £100K/week combined. Had Aquilani stayed, he would have been £80K/week.

In the end, the players they brought in are all playing regular first team football, that we pay less than we were paying reserve team players last year.

Third, merits: Given where we started out a year ago, can you honestly say that you think ANY other manager would have done better? You saw what Roy Hodgson did, you see how AVB struggle at CFC (and I can guarantee that he gets paid more than Dalglish!!). I am certainly sorry that Rafa was let go, but in the position the club was in last year, I don't think you'd find a manager better suited for the job. Bringing Rafa back was not an option, although he was technically available, he had just been sacked by Inter. And frankly, I think it would have been the wrong solution. 

Maybe Dalglish wouldn't have won the CL in 2005, maybe he would have won the league? Maybe both? It would only be speculation. 

You can't say that Dalglish is a bad manager, just look at what he's done

-Won the double in his first season as manager

-Won the league 3 times  and the FA cup twice in 5 seasons

-Brought Blackburn from bottom of second division in 1991 to win the Premier League in 1995

The dirty little secret of SEO is that a basic writing ability is generally all that's required.  Unfortunately, it's a skill that's often lacking.

I once had a customer bemoaning the fact that his web site didn't rank very well for ""X Y Z whatever"".  I pointed out to him that the reason for that was probably that his web site (containing the copy that he insisted on writing himself, badly) didn't actually contain the phrase ""X Y Z Whatever"" anywhere.  I persuaded him to let me re-write it, deleted a few thousands word of gumph and replaced it with ""We are X Y Z Whatever specialists, blah blah"".  We were on google's first page a month later.

Of course, it's not always as easy as that.  In this case, ""X Y Z Whatever"" was a fairly specialised term and we weren't fighting against thousands of other web sites to compete for it.

&gt; First, Netflix’s rivals in the U.K. and Ireland are a lot more established. The biggest obvious competitor is Lovefilm, a DVD rental and on-demand streaming service that was bought out by Amazon a year ago.

Lovefilm's streaming is crap. 800Kbps is their one and only bitrate, and it looks absolutely dreadful on a large TV. I've been eagerly awaiting Netflix in the UK as they offer HD streams of a lot of their content.

&gt; Netflix may think its existing relationships and successes will be transferable — particularly ones that speak the same language and share similar tastes for Hollywood movies and American television.

There's plenty of Birtish TV on there already. A dozen seasons of Top Gear, for example. That's more than 100 episodes, and far more than is available on iPlayer.

&gt; In addition, Sky has invested heavily in mobile streaming apps with SkyGo, and has just announced a stake in Zeebox, an innovative TV guide app that I wrote about a few months ago.

Great if you're a Sky subscriber.

&gt; The biggest difference that Netflix will find between America and Britain, however, is one that only takes three letters to explain: The BBC.

It's interesting reading the [STOP HS2](http://stophs2.org/facts) facts because they seem to ignore the need for more capacity in the long term, which cannot be met by indefinitely adding more carriages and trains (of course Rail Package 2 could see us by a few decades). They also claim that rail travel produces more carbon emissions, which I strongly doubt. From [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/jan/29/theairlineindustry.ecotourism.observerescapesection), a train journey of 650km from London to Edinburgh produces 24kg of CO2, while calculating from [these data](http://www.carpages.co.uk/co2/) suggests that the mean new model car produces around 153g/km of CO2 (admittedly I have no data on actual models sold, but as a ballpark figure it will do), or 100kg/CO2 for the same journey. That's one passenger vs one car, but I doubt there are 4 passengers in every car to London.

I don't doubt that the government's claim of carbon neutrality is nonsense, but it seems that HS2 is a reasonable option given the choices. Also, their projections of spend vs benefit are a bit silly, but it's impossible to forecast such things with any accuracy.

The Gov. (= schools) got a deal on them, the majority of everyone else bought the far less expensive (and far more popular) ZX Spectrum.

Anyone who actually had the £300+ tended to go for the Commodore 64, and with good reason - better gfx, sound, more RAM....however, the main justification/ excuse mooted about at the time was always 'the BBC has better BASIC' - but the C64 forced you to learn Peek'n'Poke registers, meaning that when you got to assembler you already knew them by heart. But hey, BASIC was difficult, no-one would ever make it beyond that, right? And so it was that at 14/ 15 I was doing simple assembler stuff at home while being given detentions at school because someone my age *couldn't possibly* comprehend a BASIC for/ next loop, so I 'must have gotten it out of a magazine'. Seriously, that was the mentality back in 1984.

As a result, millions of schoolkids were denied a reasonable IT education because they weren't allowed to submit programs in anything other than 'BBC Basic' (so any homework was pointless). It followed that I (and a huge number of other IT bods) made our careers with little or no help from the Gov./ Schools in any way at all.

___________________

Well this is a lovely thread to come to first thing on r/united kingdom. At the time I start typing, two parent comments both calling the girl's account into question from the basis of *one* article. It makes me genuinely sad that there should be such sentiment taking such prominence in r/uk, though it's only been up for an hour or so, and [coppersink](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fq93v) has been pointing out, to a degree, as to how the girl is not the person whose actions should be called into question as such.

I came into the thread to question why the headline was what it is, and why the article speaks of the parents of the accused in apparently more prominence than they speak of him, and to say that's not really very fair on them, and to express my surprise at reading he's in his 40's when the impression I got was that he was going to be of a similar age to the accuser. That, I think, is a more pertinent question than calling the alleged victim's account into question.

If she had been drugged and *robbed*, or if it had been a 16 year old boy who claimed to have been raped, would there be such ""musings""? I really wonder.

&gt; [One little thing stand out here for me - ""suddenly being tired at 2.30 am"" is proof of having your drink spiked?
And what on earth was this young woman hanging around with a man old enough to be her father?](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fq6hd) - frostek

2:30am - That *stood out* did it? Really? Of course this should throw the whole story into doubt, because no sane reddit user would be awake and 'not tired' at such hours. That kind of behaviour is unthinkable! No-one around here has *played video-games* until well after midnight and not been tired.

Young woman/man-old-enough - I don't know whether it was intended, but that (rhetorical) question sounds like you're saying: ""By Christ, what did she expect?!"" i.e. ""If this happened well it's somewhat her fault, of course."" Is that really what we're still doing? Rape case = possibly lying as a matter of course? The CPS decided there was enough evidence to go to trial. Does that mean he's automatically guilty? Of course not, but how often does this ""Hmm could be lying"" come up with regards to any other type of case? Rarely. It does, but *rarely*. Sexual assault is a special case, it seems. Goodo.

&gt; [You do have to wonder at this one ...](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fq723) - Geoffric

Why? Why do you have to *wonder* at *this one*? What is it in particular about the case, that the CPS who decided there was enough evidence to take it to trial, makes you have to question the validity of the girl's story?

Now, of course: Innocent until proven guilty but that does *not* mean that the alleged victim is automatically ""Lying until proven to be telling the truth"".

Too many people are too damn quick to pass judgement, or at least give the impression of having done so, on the *wrong* person when it comes to rape cases.

Hey look everyone! Did you see this? It was the *fifth paragraph in the article*:

&gt; Tim Clarke, prosecuting, said Murray, who grew up at Scone Palace, sent her a text message hours after the alleged rape that said: ""If you call the police and cry rape and that I spiked your Ribena, our friendship will be over. You can get a pill from Boots. James.""

Well shit. I wonder if the police and the CPS saw that text? Let's have a think: Would it have been mentioned in court if it wasn't verifiable? Of course, being skeptical by nature I have to say ""Well I don't know, possibly?"" and I couldn't decide until I saw the transcript. And of course it doesn't mean he *did* actually rape her: she could have had misgivings the next morning and this is following on from her saying ""I'm going to say you drugged and raped me."" 

But you know what, that scenario didn't automatically leap out at me, at least not in a way that would make me write a comment along those lines. Why does *that* possibility get so much airtime?

Further comments since I started writing:

&gt; [Assuming she is telling the truth.    
Entirely possible that they had a falling out and she twists the story.    
Hopefully they did some blood/urine analysis to find out what, if anything, was in her system.

I think you can guess what my reply might be to most of that.

There are far more comments in the thread now than when I started, but fuck me there are far too many going down the ""People have cried rape in the past... etc."" route than healthy. There are *far more* unreported actual rapes than successfully prosecuted rape cases. That doesn't mean there might not be false cases in court, but it does undermine the sheer number of people who will call an alleged victim into question.

You're speaking as if there's never been cases where alleged rape victims haven't faked it for one reason or another and the case never even got to court.

The case you cite was an arrest, not a court case. Remember that, at least.

As I said: Far more rapes don't even get reported than are successfully prosecuted. That simple fact alone should silence the *myriad* of people who say ""Hmm well this story is a little bit suspect."" That's not to say the response should be ""Boo hang this fucker"". When it comes to court cases that are ongoing, generally any comment is somewhat pointless and, in the case of rape, often shows how skewed peoples' thinking can be.

&gt; leads to people abusing the system

How many people were convicted of rape in the last 10 years? How many people were convicted of lying about rape? How many estimated rapes are there a year?

By sheer weight of numbers, the *regular* questioning of an alleged rape victim is *way* out of proportion. Disclaimer: Along with child abuse, rape is perhaps the worst thing I can think of to be wrongly accused of. People who do it are evil and twisted individuals. Mud sticks and that's awful. HOWEVER: Questioning the accuser is not the logical course of action when it comes to pretty much every. damn. mention. of a rape case.

&gt; All I'm saying is that we should hold off on pointing the finger either way, until more evidence then a text message is given out.

Which is why there are so many comments and questions in this thread that point the finger at the girl rather than at Murray. For the record, I have not decided who is guilty and who is not, who is lying and who is not. But I bloody well won't spend my time questioning the validity of the girl's story simply because *very occasionally* people lie about rape AND it goes to court.

It sounds heartless to argue against wheelchair regulations, for example, but in many ways politicians wield this stuff in the same way they use ""think of the children"" to get things passed. There are many small businesses in America, for example, who had to close because they could not afford to install the wheelchair elevators into shops that were housed in old style buildings. $30,000+ sometimes to install something that literally might have been used 2 or 3 times a year in their small town. On the other hand the big corporations love these regulations because they can always jump through the hoops where the little guy can't. In this way semi-monopolies form on the market that wouldn't if it weren't for government.

As to the overall concern I don't believe it's justified. Right now there are many government roads that are full of potholes or aren't properly equipped for wheelchairs and zimmerframes.

true,Grigori7,english,London,"A review of over 3500 investigations into the effectiveness of juries at objectively deciding whether or not someone is actually guilty found, in short, that they're bloody ineffective due to the fact that everyone has personal biases (Gerbasi, Zuckerman, &amp; Reis, 1977; if you're interested).

Now let's combine that with literature about attitudes towards rape in the UK. Amnesty International (2005) found that 30% of people believe that a woman is responsible for getting raped if she is drunk (4% totally responsible, 26% partially responsible). 

34% believe a woman is responsible for being raped if she acts flirtatiously (6% totally, 28% partially). 

37% believe it's her responsibility if she fails to clearly say ""no"" (8% totally, 29% partially). 

26% believe it's her responsibility if she was wearing revealing clothing (6% totally, 20% partially).

This one's my favourite. 22% believe that a woman is responsible for being raped if she has had many sexual partners in the past (8% totally, 14% partially).

If the Earl's solicitor can establish any one of these factors, the averages say that he's won quarter of the jury. Obviously this effect won't be cumulative - a person who holds one rape myth belief is likely to hold more than one.

However, two final statistics:

- Only 4% of people asked knew that there are over 10,000 reported rapes in the UK each year.
- Between 1% and 9% of these result in a conviction.

I found one or two talking about how bad it was when men get falsely accused, but those were in response to comments which made that position entirely relevant.

If anything, Conot's and Geofferic's comments look to be balanced and more relevant than the negative reactions against them.

Examples:

&gt; At the moment, I don't think we can say who is telling the truth here

---

&gt; This doesn't mean he didn't do it, but it casts a suspicious light on this ""evidence"".

---

&gt; All I'm saying is that we should hold off on pointing the finger either way, until more evidence then a text message is given out.

---

&gt; Pending that testimony, I'll withhold my reservations, but you make a good point.

---

&gt; I agree, rape is a horrible crime, and those who commit it SHOULD be punished to the full extent of the law. I'm simply offering a different viewpoint.

~ Conot

---

&gt; Hopefully they did some blood/urine analysis to find out what, if anything, was in her system.
Either way, I personally find him to be a sleaze bag, but there's legal and there's illegal sleaze.

---

&gt; I think she is telling the truth about 90% of what she's said. I simply see nothing damning about the other 10%. It's an accusation. She needs proof. If she has proof, then hang the bastard out to dry.
Until she has proof (and having sex with her is hardly proof of rape) the man is innocent.

~ Geofferic

I'll be completely honest: money is going to be a big issue. Sorry if you already know this, but you'll face three major challenges:

As an international student you will be paying much higher rates than domestic students. Most universities have a lot of leeway when it comes to how much they charge.

The second issue will be getting a visa. In order to secure entry on a tier 4 (educational) visa, you need to be able to demonstrate that you have enough money to support yourself. It is not enough on its own to have an offer to study. Your visa will also probably prohibit you from being allowed to work while here.

Finally, the cost of living - particularly in London - is pretty high. If you are able to live for free, as you suggest, then you'll save a packet. But you should be *absolutely sure* that your family don't mind you staying for as long as it takes you to complete your studies.

I can pull up more reviews if you think that 2010 isn't recent enough. If you don't, please phrase your response in as condescending a manner as the one above. It makes the process much more enjoyable for me.

I started with episode 1 of Eccleston. At first I was really unsure if I wanted to continue. It just seemed kind of cheesy to me. But then, with the urging of many here on r/doctorwho, I pushed on. By episode 3, I was interested. Interested enough to finish the season.

By the end of the season, I was excited. I wanted to see what this Tennant fellow was going to be about. Once I got into Tennant I was hooked. I think he made a wonderful doctor, and I think they did some amazing things with the story. Strong supporting characters. By the end of Tennant's run, I was absolutely completely hooked. I'm not afraid to admit that I got something in my eyes many times during the conclusion of Tennant's run.

Doctor Who is a story that has a way of really getting into you emotionally. At least it does so for me. Doctor Who is totally completely worth it. But my advice to you is to start at the beginning of Series 1 of the reboot (Eccleston). And just watch it in order. I wouldn't have done it any other way.

I'm currently working through the first season of Matt Smith's tenure on Netflix Instant. I've also started working in some of the classic Who that's available on Netflix.

While some of the figures seem way off-base (probably due to sample size etc), it seems there is a pretty good consensus across the FBI, British Home Office, Australian Police, and then the Lisak and Other sections bear this up.

&gt; My point is that 90%+ are, by your numbers, not false allegations

Absolutely, I'm not trying to detract from that fact ... however, when you start bandying around language such as ""tiny number"", I just felt it necessary to point out that 5 - 8 % is far from ""tiny"".

It is unfortunately the most awkward of crimes as there are invariably no witnesses, and it boils down to a game of ""he says, she says"" and who has the best ""moral character"" ... by whatever definition the jury chooses to apply.

But I would defend anyone's right to QUESTION any accusation ... I mean after all, if we are to truly respect guilty until PROVEN innocent, the accusation itself should be neither believed OR disbelieved, nor given ANY more weight than the denial, until it has been PROVEN. By taking a side either way, you have already made your decision before hearing all the facts.

Personally, I believe in all crimes, but especially in accusations of rape where there are invariably no witnesses and no need whatsoever for the public to be involved, that BOTH parties should be given anonymity until AFTER the verdict has been read.

This is not like a murder or robbery where the police have to appeal for witnesses or rely on people with video cameras or cellphones ... this is an accusation that was made about something that occurred inside a private residence.

When it comes to rape, or child abuse etc. I'm amazed that the press happily reports on who is accused or on trial of what. I agree with you that both parties should be afforded anonymity. As many others have pointed out in the thread, rape etc. will damage your reputation even if you're shown to be innocent.

With regards to the statistics: It seems that there is generally some conflation of ""false"" with ""unfounded"", in fact the details from the BHO seem to reduce the reported 8% to around 2%, due to a number of factors. It doesn't appear to be clear cut, as the police can be biased as a source too. Not a good thing :(

But I should have made myself clear, though I stick by the ""tiny"" aspect, that I was talking about the number of false allegations made is tiny compared to the number of rapes that go unreported as well as those that are successfully prosecuted. I think I said that elsewhere, but not in that comment you replied to. That was my fault, I should have been clearer.

To cover other things you said: I don't think I took a side, or at least didn't intend to come across that way. Personally I hold hold judgement in these cases, in fact I think I can count on one hand the number of cases that I have 'decided on' in the past before the jury etc. returned their own verdict. In general it's never really occurred to me to say ""Innocent"" or ""Guilty"" because I don't know all the facts and I'm not in court! People can question, yes, but with situations like this then I feel the need to question the justifications behind those queries. Elsewhere in the thread there's interesting/disheartening figures from [Grigori7, concerning the way people view rape victims and fault.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqopj).

No one is saying they won't keep coming, however people here seem to really underestimate how much of draw the monarchy is for American tourists. Without the monarchy, there will be less of draw to come to the UK specifically. Now how much of a draw in pound terms I'm sure is debatable.

true,FireNode,null,null,"As someone who has followed HS2 since it was first proposed by Labour (and before that the Lib-Dem's and Tory's proposals).

HS2's main priority is to speed up London to Birmingham services and up. the main sub-priority is to free up paths along the West Coast Main line (also midland and East coast to some extent). This would allow more trains to run per hour. These free paths would allow for a mix of freight or local passenger services as well as some 125 mph services, this would take more lorries and buses/cars off the roads.

Another priority of HS2 is to combat the capacity issues in and around London and it's termini. It is expected in 2014 that Waterloo station will be at full capacity with Euston, St. Pancras and King's cross soon to follow. HS2 will relieve pressure at Kings Cross, St.Pancras and Marylebone. by providing a faster service that will attract more passengers to one area instead of several and will then change in some of the less congested hubs such as Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Manchester and such (by the way I hate people who suggest that we need more hubs instead of one, we have loads with the biggest few being Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Cardiff).

This will benefit England, Scotland and Wales a lot with a faster service to Birmingham and a faster service to Scotland/Wales because of this time lost. Last I heard about 50 minutes for a London-Birmingham service instead of 70 minutes and a London-Edinburgh service taking 30 minutes less. if the Y junction is built for a Manchester and Leeds services it would take 30 minutes off Scotland services again and a service that takes 1 hour 20 minutes to get to Leeds (almost rivalling today's London-Birmingham service). Also in conjunction with

All tough the cost of this service will most likely be higher than the current rate it will be cheaper than getting a plane, and the main cost for a France-England/Scotland/Wales tickets will most likely come from Eurostar who offer ridiculous prices in regards to plane tickets

However, the Coalition have made several mistakes within their plans.
The main problem with HS2 is the pressure it will place on the central tube lines running in and around Euston and Kings Cross/St.Pancras stations and will suffer from severe over-crowding, unless the East-West Rail link is built it can't really be solved with more trains per hour or platform and train extensions. Another way to solve this is to create a walkway (moving or not) or a quick tram style transport system between St.Pancras and Euston (was proposed back in BR days I believe).

In regards to Job figures Christian Wolmar has already explained that they are exaggerated by the Coalition by around 50K.

Another figure that doesn't quite work in their plan is the amount of trains per hour. This is currently 18 trains per hour, and is going to be really hard to follow through, hell not even China can manage that, so how on Earth will we unless we abandon Conventional track and move into Maglev (which defeats the point of stuff north of Birmingham/Manchester and Leeds)

""Up to"" four hundred as the article states is not a bad turnout but probably these will be the committed parents / PTA and some of the governors.  The Ofsted report from January 2011 is damning in many different areas, but the most recent follow-up inspection in mid-September is much better and shows the school is addressing the issues raised.  No doubt locally the school has a poor reputation and may well be haemorraging students which poor Ofsteds tend to precipitate.

I suppose the argument of the school will be that turning them into an academy will wrench control from the existing governors and bring in a new controlling authority, be this either an already successful school or one of the new ""education trusts"" that are springing up especially in inner-city schools.  Personally, I'm exceptionally wary of these as, although they're currently non-profit, it's a slippery slope towards profit-making bodies running state schools.  Politically, as well, the process of academisation wrenches control of the schools away from the Local Education Authorities which for decades have been thorns in the sides of a string of (Tory) Education Secretaries.

Clearly something has to change in this school - though the evidence suggests that process is underway, although at a fairly slow pace as it's never easy to rapidly turn around a low-performing school, let alone one which appears to have underachievement ingrained into it.  However, it does seem unfair to not even allow the school to have a choice about its own future and who controls it.

If you travel off peak, you produce less CO2 by car than by rail.

Another thing, the 18 trains a hour, each way, that HS2 headline as a target is way in excess of the 12 trains an hour which SNCF have found is possible on the TGV. And I seriously doubt that the rolling stock will be procured to meet this target (at least 40-50 trains) within our lifetimes. If you read the transport research group report you will see that if the HS2 was not taken beyond Birmingham to serve Manchester in particular, it's economic viability will be very low, as there just aren't enough people who want to make that journey. What's the betting some future government will *not* extend the line, because there isn't enough money in the coffers?

Did I say it would be interesting? Yes

My definition of interesting: Neither a good connotation or a bad connotation.

What does 'at best' mean? No it doesn't mean he will be. No it doesn't mean he can't be. It means it falls within the realm of possibility regardless of the probability of it happening.

What does 'Just a thought' mean? Just an idea.

I live in Cornwall most of the time, and I have just got FTTC thanks to the combined efforts of the local council (Conservative-led), BT and the EU.

Some interesting characteristics of the programme include a lot more FTTP than the rest of the country is getting (my road has FTTC, but the new housing estate in the road over is getting FTTP. I live in a small village), as well as BT is really pulling out the stops to get things done. 

You hear about delays when it comes to getting cabinets operational elsewhere (and this is true for the cabinet serving where I live in Reading - it only just got turned on but it has existed ever since I moved in in July), yet in Cornwall there's no such delay - indeed my own cabinet was operational less than a month from installation.

In parts of the country the dates keep slipping for FTT* service. In my village the dates kept moving forward (it was originally scheduled for August 2012).

As for HS2, I feel it is a waste of money. It benefits the same few places that already have a decent rail service.

Leased lines cost a ton more than a consumer or even small-business grade internet connection. Big businesses can afford that, but small or home businesses can't.

You can get a quality 40/10 FTTC connection from a reputable business-centric ISP for £40 or £50 a month and £80 installation.

Further the land that you describe as cheap is not going to be in a town, so BT will charge you even more to get that leased line installed there (IIRC installation cost is highly dependant on distance from point of presence which may not be the local telephone exchange).

Rape is a crime where the presence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of guilt.  The only other crimes where this seems true off the top of my head are petty larceny and fraud, and neither of these are BARRK crimes.

But according to the American legal system, we are pretty much compelled to assume some form of misunderstanding until the jury comes out.  What seems more interesting is how rarely observers invoke this *until* a rape accusation springs up.  No one **ever** defends the innocence of accused murderers and robbers and burglars and, in fact, they often leap to attack them as soon as their faces are displayed.  But rape?

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"I'm not really cynical, but it's kind of what happens when shit content starts to appear on a reddit. 

Anyway I can't put it any better than this [6 year redditor did,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/o1zjo/ban_memes_in_rpsychonaut/c3drsz4) so I'll let them take the stage. 

&gt;Meme comments by their nature attract upvotes easily, because they are short and can be read quickly, are funny and clever at first, inspire an 'in joke' sort of feeling (if you're cool and get it, you upvote). We'll call this LOW-EFFORT CONTENT. Longer, more insightful comments, the kind that makes this one of my favorite subreddits, take longer to read, you don't always agree with them, and in general require much more effort from the reader to earn upvotes. We'll call this HIGH-EFFORT CONTENT.

&gt;So to begin with, even in a community that is naturally biased against memes, they have a competitive advantage over interesting comments. So even if most people in the subreddit are against memes, they can still rise to prominence, because it's just easier to read and upvote them.

&gt;Second, this effect is greatly exacerbated when new users who don't get the ethos of the subreddit join. They are far more likely to engage in low effort upvoting behavior. Once a subreddit reaches a certain critical mass, low effort content beats high effort content, every time. It sucks, but that's how it is. So you have to make a choice about which you would rather have.

&gt;As a subreddit gets diluted with more new users, the high-effort, mind expanding comments are overwhelmed by low effort jokes, and valuable contributors become discouraged and stop contributing as much. Once they start gaining a toehold, people writing and reading mind-expanding comments are going to look elsewhere, and as the size of the subreddit expands people will spend more time contributing memes, because that's what works.

The truth is as im sure your experience will reflect, that religion very rarely comes into the equation, even at a faith school.

Lastly, faith schools are almost *exactly* the same as academies in that the governance of the school is left up to a third party (in this case the parish).

Be you religious fundamentalist or Dawkins' boyfriend, we shouldn't be so closed minded about other ways of running our country. The state is good for a lot, but why not capitalise on infrastructures already present, that are proven to be effective.

true,sesse,null,null,"Ok, let's talk about IQ. Here is a fact: IQ scores have been rising steadily all over the world for decades now and the difficulty of intelligence tests are revised on a regular basis. According to an [estimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect#The_rise_in_IQ) an average score of 100 corresponds to a score of 80 in 1932 in US. The numbers may not be exact but there is no question that tests of today are harder and people are either more intelligent or better educated.

Here is another fact: [A study(pdf link)](https://occidentalascent.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/nijenhuis_european-journal-of-personality_18_2004_u.pdf) in Netherlands showed that progeny of non-western immigrants tend to be smarter than their parents.

Here is something that is **NOT** a fact: that the cause of IQ gap between white and black people in US (seriously, substitute any western country here) is genetic.

From these, we can infer that there is a high chance education and culture play a major role in a persons overall intelligence and their genetic heritage a minimal role perhaps.

So it seems that the obvious solution is to encourage people to study, make it cheaper for them, raise your standards of education...etc, instead of being racist and saying a country should only allow qualified people to immigrate. As long as we live in capitalist societies, there will probably be some people who are better off than the average and some who are worse of than the average.

Maybe the reason why minorities are statistically more likely to live in poverty is because people like you act racist towards them and discourage them from becoming contributing members of a society by implying that they are genetically lesser beings than you. There are people who need to lower status' of other people so that they can elevate their own. Maybe they don't want to work hard to be better than others because they feel entitled to a superior status in society purely due to their heritage, or maybe there are other reasons. I don't know if you are one of them or not.

Many faith schools are their own admissions authorities, which means they can give preference to children from families which share the religion of the school.

&gt; I also just thought that we may end up bumping Ramires to RW and Sturry to FW for a couple games, in which case Essien could start on the RM.

It's a possibility I supposed, and scoring two goals may do some justification for it. I don't think Ramires has ever played that far forward so it might not be that smart of a move. He'll cover every inch of the pitch, why restrict him? Would prefer to see a new, versatile winger come in (versatile as in, can play LWF/RWF).

&gt; I think I'd expect an Essien/Lampard/Meireles circle for that LM spot, but then again with him just returning I could see him as the Romeu sub that can attack a little more.

I think playing him deeper will be easier on his knees. Playing defensive football is easier than attacking, in terms of the wear and tear on the knees, plus Romeu's role will not require too much running. It would be an ideal spot to help him gain match fitness, and probably why he was played so deep in the midfield for the Reserves.",0,1326232016,null,0,false,0,c3fvrs7,t3_obav9,t1_c3fvrs7,t1_c3fvoxb,null,1428157386,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

One questioned whether or not she had been spiked. *The article itself* was unclear on whether or not she had been spiked. It also questioned why she was friends with the man in the first place. That isn't an accusation of guilt. It's the same questions a jury would ask themselves if presented with the same information. This comment now sits at -6 points.

Another commenter said ""you do have to wonder"". For simple curiosity he now sits at -4 points.

Both of these comments sparked discussions which were critical of the accused, but careful not to speculate on whether or not he was actually guilty. 

One called the guy a dick. +16.

One made a joke. +42.

My comment follows these, and you say you never saw mine, so the thread at the time was pretty much as I described above.

So yes. I am calling your comment reactionary. Half of the comments were skeptical of *some details* - in fact, not even skeptical; they simply posed questions which led to further discussion. The other half were jokes. But now that the original thread is lost, people see your comment and assume that you are completely right in calling out all the apparent rape apologists which abound r/unitedkingdom, even though you actually provide links to the perfectly valid comments which I have described above. 

Meanwhile, I explain my own point of view and ask you to not get so annoyed when the thread hasn't yet unfolded fully. For that I get -6. But, was I not correct? Now the thread is *full* of people who aren't ""skeptical of the accuser"". All I asked was that you wait for those non-skeptical people to arrive in order to better judge the general attitude of the thread. But now the thread is no longer predominantly ""skeptical"", so that quite clearly shows that you were being reactionary at first. For explaining that to you I got -5. Lovely. And now you say ""there *was* a general attitude"". No, there was an *initial* attitude. The *general* attitude is the attitude that prevails after a majority of the comments have been posted.

 ""One person out of three or four""? No, two out of four. There you go, *half* of the initial comments were skeptical, one called the guy a dick, and the other was a joke. But of course I'll get downvoted just for pointing out these facts. If two of my neutral comments got -5 and -6 points, then fuck knows what I'll get for being critical of the top commenter in the thread. The one who was reactionary, despite his own protestations. The one who turned this from a discussion about the article itself, to a discussion about the people discussing it. The one who made people think that commenters who even *slightly questioned* some elements of the story were actually a bunch of rape apologists. Who gives a fuck if the accuser had been a 16 year old male? Why are you using hypotheticals to justify your intangible, moronic and, yes - unjustified - point?

For starters, creationism is already taught in some UK schools and has been for some time. Just see the academies set up under - shamefully - Labour that were funded by Sir Peter Vardy.

Secondly, this rule applies to the new Free Schools, which in itself is a loaded subject, particularly with regard to hiring standards advocated as opposed to the state ( yes I fucking said state, I'm taking it back, Statist 4 Life ).

As to the disgusting practice of pretend to be of a church to gain entry to a school? It's not a one way street you know. These schools know the score. They just hope to snare a few souls. A local Catholic primary would give lollipops to kids if they had been noticed attending Mass.

The difference between sync and profile rate is caused by the way BT's hardware caps your connection (for what I believe are stability reasons). If you are on an ADSL 1 Connection (up to 8Mbps) the fastest you modem can connect to the exchange is (in theory) 8Mbps, however to make sure there is no data loss BT's hardware lowers your throughput (the speed at which you download/upload) which means the fastest speed theoretically possible on an ADSL 1 connection is actually 7.15Mbps, with ADSL2+ (24Mbps) the fastest speed theoretically possible is 21Mbps.

Actually once I had a problem with ingame lag. I've phoned them up, the girl at the desk couldn't help me as she wasn't versed in the angry-nerd-1337-speech I used back then, so she forwarded me to the actual CEO. I was shocked. I mean the CEO himself answers support calls and helps people out. The problem was sorted in 10 minutes, it seems like there was some port problem at their end after maintenance. 

The speeds I get from them are amazing. I'm from Cookstown, and I'm currently on fibre optic and I max out my download speed at 4.9 mb/s. You would probably get a lot more in Belfast or the surrounding area. They ""limit"" your bandwidth usage during peak hours. I have a 60GB limit from 8AM to 8PM. I'm paying £37.99 for this. Could pay less if I wouldn't want the 10mbit upload addon. Everything not included in those hours is unlimited and weekends come into the unlimited time. So pump that torrent during night or saturday/sunday as much as you like.

Through out the day, internet speed never variates. Its always the same. Be it 6AM in the morning, 7PM in the evening, its always lightening fast. Gaming pings are amazing. I'm sitting at 40ms on SWTOR. Heroes of Newerth go up to 65ms max in European servers.

&gt; [Geofferic:](http://i.imgur.com/BmO5m.png) My voting is +3 overall for him. Nothing on this thread.    
&gt; [Frostek:](http://i.imgur.com/kDMc9.png) No votes from me.    
&gt; [OJSlaughter:](http://i.imgur.com/lzHVG.png) +4 Overall from me. Nothing on this thread.    
&gt; [TheForeignMan:](http://i.imgur.com/D03vz.png) -1 overall from me. One minus on this thread.

 I've disagreed with Geofferic elsewhere, by the way. Note the voting overall.

I don't downvote unless something is abusive/obnoxious or not adding to the discussion. When it comes to discussions and threads, I only vote up and *certainly* don't downvote just because someone disagrees with me. It's a personal gripe and I think people who do that are morons. [As such I applaud your efforts here, though sympathise with you due to the fuckwits that downvoted it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqier) I often have to make similar edits to my own posts to stop people being numpties. *edit - great, since I started replying some twat has downvoted you already.* Ownards:

With regards to the latter rather 'heated' comments from you: Cry me a fucking river. I'm so awfully sorry there wasn't a discussion the way *you* wanted the discussion but you know as well as I do the reaction that these stories generally gets and despite your cries that it was all a lovely discussion (of that handful of comments remember) before I came and ruined the party: So I didn't wait until it ended up with the usual number of apparent rape apologists/overly skeptical commenters, but started on the few that were there. One is too damn many and it's about time more of a fuss was made over it.

Look at the stats provided by [Grigori7](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqopj) regarding the general attitude towards rape. Everything he/she posted further on in the thread is relevant to why I made the comment.

I saw enough comments to decide to comment the way I did: to call out the comments the way they were written and presented. Do tell me: How many *should* I have waited for that were 'skeptical'? 60%? 80%? The two parent comments were skewed to be questioning the victim in way you do NOT see with any other type of court case. Is that clear? Good.

I was the first person to respond to Geofferic when he said ""You have to wonder about this one..."". ""Why?"" I asked. [At one point that question - can anything add to a discussion more? - was standing at +3/-3 votes,](http://i.imgur.com/or84g.png) so none of us are immune from the fuckwits clicking buttons. Now, 10 hours later, he still hasn't replied to me though he's spoken to others. And you know what? [The way I thought he was commenting i.e. ""Hmm this doesn't sound plausible"" was pretty much bang on.](http://i.imgur.com/XIxjS.png)

[CressCrowbits' comment is exactly the issue and the one I was bringing up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqhgn) Skepticism is fine and dandy but EVERY thread about a rape case will result in a disproportionate amount of skepticism directed at the alleged victim. I'm not sure that's something you can disagree with, nor do I think you would. So... you're arguing that I should have waited until it had happened? More people would have posted along those lines, we both know it, and not in a normal healthy skeptical way. I don't think I've ever called it out so extensively in this way before, but I sure as hell will if I see it again. I think you can agree that I'm not looking to stifle debate, but rather the way in which that debate is undertaken.

I made it clear in my comments that I was not calling out skepticism, but the *level* of skepticism that always appears on rape threads. It was appearing when I wrote my comment. Balls to the fact that I didn't wait until everyone checked in. I could have replied to both the parent threads but I thought ""Sod it, I'll make my own."" If you think that makes me reactionary... *shrug* I'm not really going to agree with you I'm afraid.

With regards my hypothetical questions: Do I really have to explain how a story about a female being raped will likely be treated differently to a male being raped? I would hope not. It's the bigger picture I'm referencing there, to again show up the inconsistencies when it comes to (female) rape.

From the first comment you made in reply to me:

&gt; [Hey chill out, we're just having a discussion. Any rape accusation notable enough to make the papers is going to be analysed along these lines. We're not ""questioning alleged rape victims all the fucking time.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqhui)

There wasn't a discussion at the time I started, not on the comments I was referencing. And any such rape case is going to be analysed along these lines: That is the problem! That, right there! Can you not see that? The very fact that rape cases are treated differently is the way in which alleged rape victims are scrutinised beyond anything any other type of accuser faces.

&gt; Thanks for your fucking contribution to the fucking thread.

Eccleston as the Doctor was recovering from the traumas of war, too angry to be emotional, so that the softness Rose managed to get out of him was impressively touching. Yes, I'm being stereotypically female, but that definitely made it easier for me to care for these characters.

By the time Tennant assumed the role, however, the Doctor was already pretty smitten with Rose and less afraid of those feelings, even though he'd never voice it.

&gt; Fear of rape apology

I can understand that, but really - again when you consider the way rape is viewed in wider society - the problem is skewed so far in the other direction that threads where people 'call out' apparent apologists are going to be in the minority by a long way.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Do you intend to eradicate all trolls?

They weren't trolls. There's so many and so often that it isn't trolling. Consider [Grigori7's](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqopj) research and statistics from the 'real world' as far as it goes.

The comment I linked to was someone expressing their thanks that I had called out the sentiment behind the general attitude of automatically questioning an alleged rape victim.

&gt; The top 4-5 posts in the thread are now

Yes. They are *now*. They weren't earlier and they certainly wouldn't have been if I or someone else hadn't have said anything.

The ""mass love of rape"" is not the expressing of being in favour of rape, but it is, as I say above the extensive/large number of people who question or blame, even unwittingly. This can range from ""Hmm that doesn't sound plausible [could be said with regard to any court case but will almost always appear on a rape case as a matter of course whereas it doesn't always occur in, say, a robbery]"" to ""Well what was she doing hanging around with such an older man?! [i.e. What did she think was going to happen?! = Well it's her fault a bit, isn't it?]""

&gt; This entire thread is literally about nothing. 

When it started, I saw more than one comment regarding questioning the victim. As yes, I have seen 'rape apology' (for want of a better term) around the place quite a bit - and so will anyone if they realise/understand what it is -my comment wasn't simply out of nowhere.

&gt;  We have no facts

We have some but not many and yet people think that's enough to say things that are demonstrative of the usual 'skeptical' nature when allegations of rape surface. Is that the kind of thing we would see ordinarily, in other court cases? Not really, not to the extent.

&gt; yet everybody's in a rampant hissy fit about rape.

-Get a giant sketch pad and cut pages down to size 
-Fold them in half and group pages into sets of six  
-Line up the groups of pages and draw a line down where the binding would be.
-Use something sharp (a fondue fork in my case haha) to punch holes where the line was on each group
-Use upholstery thread to sew the groups of pages together.  This was trial and error until I found a way that worked so I can't really describe what I did.  
-make the spine by gluing a strip of cheesecloth to the end and then trimming it to size
-Take two small canvas boards and glue those onto the first and last pages to give it a hard cover
-Get a blue leather coat from the thrift store, cut it up to appropriate size for the cover
-Burn in the design using a wood burning kit
-Cut out small cardboard squares and glue it onto the back side of the leather where the raised squares are
-To attach the cover I sewed part of it and when I got tired of that, used fabric glue for the rest.  
-Once it was all put together, I went over the ends and the design again with the wood burner

Hell, Lamps is even finding it hard to get a start here lately so now everyone is all gung-ho to get an injury-prone player who is past his prime in the staring XI? Doesn't really make any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, Essien has done some GREAT things in the past for us, but is he really the answer to our leaky back line and attack force that can't put the ball in the back of the net?",0,1326244731,null,0,false,0,c3fy77r,t3_obav9,t1_c3fy77r,t3_obav9,null,1428158527,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

I think giving Gerrard a more forward position would allow him to rest a bit more and open him up for more attacking chances.  Adam and Maxi/Downing crossing into Bellamy might work better than crosses into Carroll, since he likes crosses from further back.  Add Henderson passing to Gerrard I could see it being a new look and very successful.

The whole show is different from other talk shows. Avoiding the fact he has a Gay Skeleton Robot for a companion, Sid the Cussing Rabbit for a sometimes intro, Secretariat a pantomime horse, it is still unique. For example, Craig isn't exactly the sparking gloring. He's normal. While he's sober now, he used to drink a lot and even tried to suicide by throwing himself off a bridge (which was ironically prevented by a homeless guy offering him a drink and so he became overdrunk). He also has said he has tattoos of both his children. It's these things that make him not one of perfect sparks and quite normal.

But the way he acts is something in and of itself. He's a natural at pretty much everything. He appears to get pretty much no money..and this helps with the show. He sees this and pretty much just takes [the piss out of it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON2EtwhL_FE) a lot. It's also the air about it where he really doesn't care about the show...DURING the show. All these may seem bad but they do help with it being a decent talk show.

true,theomeny,null,null,"Tell your friends they are entitled in law to any pay owed to them. This will usually be settled by the administrator, in this instance a firm named KPMG. The administrator will be in touch with all former employees shortly and will send out documentation to fill in. If your friends and their colleagues haven't had any contact from the administrator within the next couple of weeks, they should get in touch with the firm and it should be sorted out. [KPMG contact details](http://www.kpmg.com/UK/en/WhoWeAre/ContactUs/Pages/default.aspx)

However, the amount that can be claimed by ex-employees from an administrator is a matter decided by the terms of each individual administration agreement. While money owed to dismissed staff will generally take precedence over that owed to suppliers and creditors, in some cases the full value cannot be guaranteed by the administrator. 

It is unlikely that this will happen in this circumstance - KPMG is a company which specializes in administrating failed firms and should be solvent enough to bear this cost. If it *does* happen, however, KPMG will make them aware of that, their rights, and how to seek compensation. 

Without going into too much detail at this stage, your friends will be guaranteed up to 8 weeks pay, including overtime, as well as pay in lieu of notice. If they have worked there for over two years, they may also be entitled to a redundancy payment or other payments. This will come from the National Insurance Fund, and will be payed by the Department for Employment and Learning. [DEL contact details](http://www.delni.gov.uk/index/contact-us.htm)

This process is designed to be done without the need for legal action, and in practice the vast majority are settled reasonably quickly and without much fuss.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Its a testament to Charles Darwin that in his day and age, with no knowledge of Chemistry, the work of Mendel or any formal mathematical training that he was able to demonstrate natural selection from pure observation and rigorous experimentation. Today we SEE evolution happening in DNA; anyone that has ever studied molecular biology of any form does not even question the nature of a gene as a survival mechanism yet; even with the comparably advanced knowledge we still have absolute *morons* that are too confused to even understand the basic premise.

The above statement is not a work of extremism (nor is the selfish gene or any other work by Dawkins), the wilful ignorance of creationists, like my aunt, would be hilarious if you didn't see the danger first hand.

The reason for my aunt being the way she is can be summed up in one word that many of Christians will find offensive (in this context); ""Heaven"". The complete and total obsession with her afterlife leads her to follow idiotic teachings. It makes her say daft far reaching political statements and it causes her to think strange and superstitious things. According to my family, though, she wasn't always this way. In fact, its only in the last 10 years, or so, that's she's gone this way.

I will agree with most normal Christians (I hate the term moderate; I'm sure their faith is just as strong as the extremist nutter it just manifests itself in a much more positive way) when they say that the concept of an afterlife doesn't have to be viewed this way.

The brilliance of this story is that now, not a single person in my family takes any of her opinions that seriously; kind of sad really, but wilful ignorance to achieve some goal should be shunned and dismissed by society as a whole.

She's not the only wacko religious nut I've found; the worst was a girl that used to flirt with boys because her ""pastor"" and church group had a few meetings where they said it was a good way of converting people to the faith. It's almost enough to make me subscribe to [/r/athiesm](/r/athiesm) and start posting rage comics for all the teenagers that have suddenly realised they're actually *allowed* to use their brain.

I considered teaching but I would have to do another year of studying for it and in effect, downsize my earning potential. If I was up for another year of uni I would rather have done a Masters degree and *increased* my earning potential.

As a computer science graduate I walked into my first job on £24k, it would have been £21k as a new teacher. 

http://www.tda.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/salary/pay-and-benefits.aspx

&gt;Once you have completed your initial teacher training (ITT) and achieved qualified teacher status (QTS), you can expect to start as a newly qualified teacher (NQT) in England and Wales on £21,588 a year (or £27,000 if you work in inner London).

&gt;Main pay scale including NQTs:

&gt;    London fringe: £22,626 to £32,588
    Outer London: £25,117 to £35,116
    Inner London: £27,000 to £36,387
    Rest of England and Wales: £21,588 to £31,552

Now to be fair I could have got over the money issue since £21k is still a reasonable starting wage but there are plenty of other reasons to stay away from it. The piss poor ICT curriculum during my own school years being a big one. I like computing, coding, hardware and the nitty gritty. I couldn't spend my life teaching bored teens how to use Word. I think most CS grads feel similar. I have to feel passionate about work I do, I have to believe in it. 

Oh right, and I couldn't actually find any courses for the PGCE for ICT/computing in my area. So I would have to move away to study. For someone with a partner and settled in an area where my existing degree could get me a good job, why would I do this?

Perhaps in future if I get fed up of being a code monkey I will consider training.... if schools look like somewhere I'd want to work. A real computing curriculum and computer science focused PGCEs rather than ICT would be necessary, as well as better pay.

In fact, this is a genius move by Alex Salmond - his backed the Tories into a corner, making them seem like the archetypal English bully telling Scotland what they can and can't do. That date has got to hurt, too: if Scotland *does* secede from he union,  the conservatives are more or less guaranteed to win Westminster elections until the end of time. Sadly, this date puts it just too late for the 2015 elections, which may be our last chance to elect a non right-wing government.

Will we end up in with Scotland being part of the EU - and probably the Euro if they have to negotiate entry as per a new state - while England leaves the EU all together? That could be a nightmare situation for London as Edinburgh has the same advantages of language and time zone as London, and it would gain access to the Euro markets just as London looses influence. Dave's two big negotiation cock-ups could spell disaster...

Final thought: Should all this come to pass, will we become Great Britain again instead of the United Kingdom?

PPS: I wonder how Dave would feel if the European Parliament was telling the UK that they can have referendum but only if they say so, and then only on their terms and day they specify.

To be fair though, I probably wouldn't have spent the last 15 years or so working in IT if I'd have taken another subject.

Having a teacher that was as interested in the subject as we were made a huge difference, something like 50% of my Computer Studies class now works in IT, either as technicians, devs or management.

Also, the Crown Prosecution Service claims [an overall conviction rate of 86.6% in 2008-2009.](http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_releases/140_09/)

So there are around 10,000 allegations of rape that make it to court, and 1-9% of these result in conviction. Compared to 86.6%, no one needs to do the statistics to know that that's a significantly lower conviction rate. 

Now the average rate at which crime is reported to the police in England and wales is estimated at 40%, and [this 2005/06 document](http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/arrests-for-recorded-crime-england-and-wales.pdf) indicates that 25.74% of reported crimes result in an arrest. This means that, on average, around 10% of all crime results in an arrest, meaning that around 8.7% of all crime results in a conviction.

[Research by the University of Surrey](http://www.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2009/16532_between_7090_rapes_thought_to_go_unreported_and_94_of_reported_cases_dont_end_in_a_conviction.htm) suggests that 70-90% of rapes go unreported. By applying the above arrest rates, we can assume that an average of 2.5-7.5% of all rapes result in an arrest, making the actual conviction rate for all rapes somewhere between 0.025% and 0.675%.

**TL;DR:**

- On average, 8.7% of all crime in the UK results in a conviction.
- On average, somewhere between .025-.675% of all rape in the UK results in a conviction.

I think you're over-simplifying; the sort of girl that's desperate to have sex because she doesn't want to look foolish in front of her friends isn't going to be listening when you as a grown-up (or even worse, a teacher) telling her that she doesn't have to.

true,widgetas,null,null,"The problem is not that it is not ""removing anything"" from Sex Education, and not even that it is attempting to ensure that abstinence is discussed as a matter of course (even though it isn't completely - I'll get to that in a minute). The problem is the motivation behind the changes:

&gt; Nadine Dorries MP's proposed Sex Education (Required Content) Bill, which seeks to secure abstinence education for **girls only**

To give you an idea of where Dorries is coming from, she said this (on C5's [Vanessa](http://www.channel5.com/shows/the-vanessa-show/episodes/episode-91-29)) last year:

&gt; “If a stronger ‘just say no’ message was given to children in school then there might be an impact on sex abuse … if we imbued this message in school we’d probably have less sex abuse.”

I shouldn't have to elaborate on how disgusting that idea is, that somehow most (young and probably female, let's not deny her intentions) abuse victims were somehow willing or complicit in their abuse.

Dorries *et al* have claimed/implied that (paraphrased) ""Children are not told that they do not *have* to have sex, that they can say no."", quote:

&gt;  [""Girls are taught to have safe sex, but not how to say no to a boyfriend who persists in wanting a sexual relationship. They are given no guidance on that whatsoever."" [She makes, or hints that they are *never* told this, more than once]](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110504/debtext/110504-0001.htm) - Column 682

Nope. Many are actually (my own small sample of me and my 3 siblings at 3 different schools over 20 years in different parts of the country is not a good basis for the general, I admit, but still...) though of course it's not mandatory, but then again a good deal of sex education isn't and one has to wonder why Dorries is focussing on *this* issue alone rather than the other problems. [This article in the Guardian from May last year brings this up](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/may/05/nadine-dorries-abstinence-bill-girls-sex). It's worth noting the [SRE bill from April 2010](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8607677.stm) was defeated, for whatever reason, but there was a [tremendous amount of resistance from the religious right](http://www.christian.org.uk/news/compulsory-sex-education-undermines-free-society/) - the kind [who support Dorries](http://www.spuc.org.uk/news/releases/2010/april20) in much of her endeavours, no matter what she has claimed to the contrary - See her speech in the House with regards to the ""Abortion counselling needs to be free from those with a 'vested' interest"" amendment which was trounced last year.

As the BHA say in their article:

&gt; Good quality, comprehensive Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) should explicitly address the option of waiting before sex, sexual consent and safe sex, all of which are important. 

I notice that most of your thread so far (at time of writing) is a disagreement with Halk regarding ""abstinence"" versus ""abstinence-only"". I think the discrepancy rises from differing views on where Dorries is coming from. Abstinence-only is of course not entirely the same as teaching about the possibility of abstinence, but abstinence-only is what Dorries *et al* want in the long run. Of course you could say I'm reactionary or pulling it from thin air, but that's the opinion held by a good many people and for good reasons. While I can agree with you (and the BHA) that discussion of ""Not having to have sex"" should of course be required, this is not the way to go about it, not least because Dorries wants it to be mandatory for *girls* only. i.e.:

""*Girls* need to be told they can say no. Boys are going to try it on and that can't be helped, but *girls* are the ones who need to be told they should be chaste. If they had been told they can be/should be abstinent then we wouldn't have so many young pregnant people. Or abuse.""

It's hard to think how else the line of thinking can come about. That should give another indication as to how she (and hers) view the issue of sex education and why many of us get the impression that Dorries *et al* (et al are receiving quite a bit of funding and support from, and learning from the mistakes of, similar groups in the US) wants a similar situation as that seen in America where sex education in many parts of the country is pitiful. Abstinence-only there has failed catastrophically, but those with a vested interest refuse to believe that it is the lack of education causing problems. [Meanwhile the STD rates continue to rise and the number of young girls who get pregnant increases.](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024658) There are more important issues to raise with regards to Sex Education and this particular amendment will not help and also sets a dangerous precedent. We shouldn't be distinguishing between the sexes when it comes to sex ed.

The Guardian article also mentions an issue I was going to mention anyway: That Dorries has often told *and repeated* lies or mis-truths, particularly about aspects of current sex education. For example ""Condoms on bananas for 7 year olds"": She mentioned this in the House, even though she should have done her research and realised it was absolute crap!:

&gt; [Teaching a child of seven to apply a condom to a banana, without telling them that they do not have an obligation to go and do it, is almost like saying, “Now go and try this for yourself.”](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110504/debtext/110504-0001.htm) - Column 682

[This is a fact check of some of the speech she gave when she gave it in the House of Commons, introducing the Bill. It's worth a read.](http://www.ministryoftruth.me.uk/2011/05/10/dorries-abstinence-speech-the-fact-check/) As you can see much/most the basis for Dorries' bill is a huge amount of misinformation. This is why so many people (NSS, BHA etc.) question her intent as well as the relevance of her bill. This would be much less of an argument if she was seeking to make a change ensuring that abstinence was a listed option for girls *and* boys, but given that before the last election Ed Balls' SRE reform was thrown out, not least by pressure from the people Dorries' often listens to, we should be making larger changes to how sex education is taught, rather than making sexist little changes that will likely to more harm than good.

edit - correction

edit - [Also, here's the MOT follow up mentioned at the bottom of the Fact Check, btw. Interest reading, imo.](http://www.ministryoftruth.me.uk/2011/07/01/is-dorries-pushing-abstinence-only-sex-ed/)

This sums up the issue as many people see it:

&gt; The entire relationship element of sex and relationships education is an optional extra and one that young people will only get if their school goes to time and effort of delivering a full SRE curriculum and only then, in some case, if they parents don’t withdraw them from these lessons.     
As a result, the sex and relationships education that is delivered in schools can be extremely variable both in quality and scope...     
And to this already uneven mix, Dorries want to add mandatory abstinence education which, for some young people will mean that all that they actually receive is abstinence-only education.",0,1326288427,null,0,true,0,c3g3exb,t3_oc8kc,t1_c3g3exb,t1_c3g303n,null,1428161049,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

However the reality of it is that things need to be paid for, either now or later.

Saving money and using that rather than using debt makes a massive difference. It's difficult, but the difference is stark.

For a family with a total income of 35K a year, who have a 100K mortgage, compared to the same family with a 130K mortgage and 20K of unsecured debt the difference is enormous. 250pcm on the mortgage and 500 on the unsecured debt is around 750 a month of debt/repayment that could have been avoided. The family with the 100K who save carefully and use that instead will have a much higher quality of life. 

They're paying a higher rate on the mortgage, and the interest on the 20K combine to about 300 per month that's just interest and nothing else. That's £5,000 extra a year they need to earn just to cover it.

So you are paying back the initial sum plus whatever is extra.  Renting for a year or two, but saving while you do so may work out cost effective in the long run.  I am not sure of the exact figures, but its something like for every £1 you borrow on a mortgage you pay back £2.  So every pound saved, you save double on a mortgage.    
  
If you do go ahead, be assertive with estate agents.  Haggle about price.  Do your homework and find out local trends in house prices.  Factor that in (mouseprices website is good for that).  Never offer the asking price.  Be prepared to WALK AWAY if you can't get the deal you want.  And I seriously mean that.  When you put an offer in, give it a deadline and put your offer in writing.  Finally, don't trust the estate agent.  No doubt there are some trustworthy ones out there but I've yet to meet one.  They say stuff like ""we already have an offer on this property"" when the probably haven't and are saying to make you worried you may ""lose"" it.  Their job is to sell and they see you, the first time buyer, as an easy touch.  But buying a home is the most expensive purchase you will ever make.

£195 arrangement fee.
£30 buildings insurance tie in penalty
£30 completion fee
£295 'valuation' fee

That's all the fees I can spot having a quick look. If they've got fees like that then they'll probably have exit fees if you move to a new lender.

Their SVR is very very bad indeed. That's what you default to after the end of the fixed period.

I wanted to compare it to a 90% mortgage so that you could see the difference after the fixed period.

A 90% rate for a 2 year fixed is 4.69% with HSBC, who don't charge fees, which is 1% lower. Additionally you're tied in for an extra year on a very high rate. I can't directly compare a 2 to a 3 year deal, but let's assume that the SVR is the same as the fixed rate - which allows a bit of a rise.

Saffron - £2700 extra interest. £550 extra fees.
So you're £3250 worse off on that rate compared to a 90% rate.

Additionally at the moment (this is advice and may be wrong) a 2 or 3 year fixed is a bad deal, you're better off on a variable rate as base rate is unlikely to change in the next 12 months, and probably won't change for 24 months. Because of that in your position I'd take HSBC's 2 year discount rate, which is basically just their SVR. 3.84%, nearly 2% lower than Saffrons.

Taking that and assuming that base rate doesn't change for 3 years you'd be £6,000 worse off. SVR is likely to change a bit by the end of 3 years, but not greatly.

Finally at the end of the three years you'd be on a rate of 5.49% with Saffron and 3.94% with HSBC.

&gt; ""It's not 'incitement to kill', it's a leaflet about making homosexuality a capital offence.""

I'm not sure there's a difference, but of course that's what's going to be decided in the court. But did you read the article?

&gt; [The Death Penalty? leaflet – which suggested three different ways to murder gay people...](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/10/muslim-anti-gay-leaflet-hate)

Hence why I asked for clarification on your position. Again.

&gt; I feel that they shouldn't be sent to prison for what they think

They're not going to be sent to prison for what they think. They might be sent to prison due to telling people what they think in a particular way. You might think there's no difference but there's a reason we have legislated in particular ways. It would depend how they worded their argument and that is again what the court will decide. I'm not sure that ""I do not think gays should have the same right to life"" is the same as ""I think gays should be killed"" or ""killed in way X, Y or Z"". It might be moot, but intent is what I think the law judges on.

When it comes to something less contentious, shall we say, consider a reaction to a paedophile:

""I think we should have the death penalty for kiddy fiddlers like him"" is not the same as ""We should go and burn down that bastards house with him locked inside"", at least not in the eyes of the law.

&gt; implication that I'm some sort of homophobe for believing in freedom of speech

I didn't imply you were a homophobe for supporting freedom of speech. To make my position clear, I agree with Peter Tatchell in his [support of the street preacher arrested](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/01/12/peter-tatchell-dont-criminalise-homophobic-christians/) for claiming gays were evil etc. and the [housing officer demoted for his thoughts.](http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/christian-manager-wrongly-demoted-over-homophobic-facebook-comments.htm) The difference is that violence was advocated here.

As I made it quite clear in my other comment you first replied to about the ""gay"" thing, I don't think people who use that term as an insult are actually trying to be homophobic, but that doesn't excuse the feeling behind it: Why is the word ""gay"" considered an insult, a bad thing? I asked for clarification on this freedom of speech point because I was interested to see you taking this position after defending those who use a word, that is synonymous with homosexual, as an insult.

Electric trains can run on electricity generated from all kinds of sources, while planes are tied in with oil which is rising in cost more rapidly than other energy sources.

The defence seems to be that there's no harm in teaching it and people can make their own minds up.

I used to think the same about creationism/intelligent design - that there's no harm in teaching them along side evolution. But it's bollocks.

The only reason people want abstinence taught in sex education is because they think abstinence is the right form of contraceptive, they're trying to crowbar their own moralism in there.

It's factual that contraception by abstinence doesn't work. Abstinence only means the same as abstinence, just the same as creationism means the same as intelligent design.

Of course I can see your reasoning and find myself agreeing to a certain extent.

But please, politicians, stop acting so ""tough on crime"" and stop threatening to throw people in prison for non-violent offences.

If they're not hardened criminals when they go in, there's a good chance they will be by the time they get out.  Save prison for people who are a danger to society and spend the money saved on providing more social housing, better education, training, etc., and creating jobs for people so they don't have to steal off us.

People also seem to seriously mock the ""condom on a banana"" approach, but it teaches kids exactly how a condom should be put on. Improper usage of a condom means it is ineffective and can open people up to STIs and conception. Despite it being something of an encouragement for sex, how else will kids learn how to do it properly? They're certainly not going to read the included instructions in the heat of the moment.

That being said, I applaud any attempt to reform ICT education and attempt to make it useful, but they need to cater to the fact that some people just don't want to program and instead of enabling them to distract those who want to learn that alternative options are available.

But to expect him to return good as new is very naive. When you have been injured for years, your body is heavily affected, and to try to change positions could be a possible action to accomodate this.
Ramires I think would be a great right back, although I'm not totally convinced he would have the greatest sense of positioning that is so crucial at right back. Essien however has played there before, and is a mature player.
Also, Ramires is essential to our midfield right now, Essien is not. Not yet anyways.

In my experience, it's a fairly dispersed community compared to here in California, and you'd only get significant clumps of people living together in places like London and Liverpool. When you take into consideration the amount of mixed race relationships, the dispersal rates go even further.

A comparison, if I may: my husband (Chinese American, grew up in the San Francisco Bay area) went to a school where being Asian didn't make you a minority - there were loads of Chinese and Vietnamese kids in his class. 

Whereas when I went to school, out of 900 kids, there was my friend Anna, and her brother... and that was it. Another friend was mixed Chinese/English, and he was the only Chinese kid in his school. Perhaps it was different in other cities, but you generally had Chinese kids when their parents were running the local takeaway - no working class families doing different jobs or middle class professionals to be seen. 

I hope it gets better in the future and logically, it should, with more and more British-Chinese kids growing up and raising their own families to be less concerned about fitting in. But for now?

true,lewiji,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"My post is very anecdotal sure, but it's no more generalised than honey-badger's post. I will take back the fact that his post is bollocks. But how is saying 'Chinese people don't integrate with British society' a less generalised statement than 'Chinese people are friendly people too and you can make friends with them'?

I understand there are 'problems' that need to be 'discussed' but shouldn't we be discussing it with, in this case, the Chinese people first hand? I'm by no means saying that everyone is just racist. All I'm saying is it's a difficult problem that isn't helped by widespread, vocal racism towards Asians in general in this country by a small portion of our society. If more people made an effort, maybe they'd feel more welcome and less insular.

As for 'people like me'; well I don't feel I'm sweeping anything under the rug. In fact I'm doing quite the opposite. It doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. I DO think there is a problem, but in my opinion the problem is to do with the attitude displayed in Honey-Badger's post. Of course is no objectively correct answer between my view and his/hers, it's all opinion at the end of the day. That said, seeing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/occa0/chinese_britons_have_put_up_with_racism_for_too/c3g5ovh) has definitely made me question his 'expertise' on this subject.

As an aside, I definitely do discuss this kind of thing openly and vocally to people around me all day, as a learner of an Asian language and someone with Asian friends. I discuss with my white friends, I discuss it with my Asian friends. It doesn't mean I'm right, it doesn't mean it's helping anything, but don't get the impression that I'm just being an apologist. Maybe I don't know enough about the problem, and maybe you know more, I have no idea.

Part-time students

If you’re studying part time, you may be able to claim Jobseeker's Allowance if you are:

out of work or working less than 16 hours a week on average

capable of working

available for work

actively seeking work

below retirement age

Jobseekers is worked out in 2 ways, either Income based (Means Tested) or Contributions (Based on NI contributions).  If you apply, they will look at your income (Unless you've worked enough for Conts based JSA).  Student support such as loans are counted as income, even if you don't take them because the Jobcentre expects you to use these means before claiming for state benefits.

Chances are you won't be entitled to it during term time, but you might be able to claim over holiday periods, when student funding/loans don't apply.

From experience, most students I dealt with didn't get anything if they were living with parents etc, but everyone's circumstances are dealt with on an individual basis, so there is no harm in trying.

Most crosses rarely see more than 1 recipient in the box, and the rare cases where there are 2 or more recipients, they are usually well marked at the near post or middle of box, with no one at the back post.  This, too, is a result of not enough off-the-ball movement.

The issue is with dodgy companies who will pay illegal immigrants under the table for less than minimum wage.

Migrant workers might compete for jobs but they are also less likely to get sick or have children in our education system. 

Actual immigrants have to go through our immigration system - it's not like Australia but we do insist they have a job waiting for them or are going to invest (hence all the small corner-shop businesses owned by immigrant families; they put up the money for the business in order to be allowed to emigrate)

Now I'm sorry, but if you start to level an argument with me on that basis, you aren't going to ever win. One of my mates said to me that he felt that if these people aren't willing to just give him the details for him to make his own donations in his own time, then he isn't willing to sign up for it.

true,mao_was_right,cnty-wales,poverty,"&gt;What are your thoughts with regards to employers sacking people for various views on minorities, and that includes government? Should they be allowed to dismiss people who are openly discriminatory for whatever reason?

I think discretion should be with the employer in this case as to whether he thinks such a person is making it impossible for others to work with him/her because of their views, though they shouldn't be sacked for their views alone. I could be a openly pro-abortion serial holocaust-denier, but as long as I'm not creating an unhealthy working environment I don't think I should be sacked for it, though ultimately it should be up to the employer to decide if I am inhibiting others' work or not.

If by 'including government', you mean government employees being sacked for having offensive views, then I don't believe that is correct in a public body unless they are openly offending other workers. 

In a private company, however, I tend more to believe that the employer should have final say on what he believes is acceptable in his/her own employees and should be able to sack employees whom they disagree and don't get along with (within reason, if the employer is being discriminatory along the reasons stated earlier then no). It wouldn't go down well on reddit, but I believe that a private company with private rules and private paychecks should have less government interference in employee contracts.

I know what this might mean. 'My idiot boss fired me because I'm  against abortion' etc, but at the end of the day, it's their company with their contracts which you signed, and as long as you're not being sacked because you're black/gay/jewish, I think that in a private company discretion should side more with the employer, in the same way I could kick you out of my house if I don't like you. Of course, unfair dismissal laws should still be in place for any abuses of this.

I understand that this may sound like it flies in the face of my freedom of speech monologue earlier, but handing out antisemetic leaflets in the city centre and telling your paymasters about stamping out the Jewish poison should be treated differently.

However, there is one thing (that niggling 1%) that makes me not entirely sure. When Captain Jack meets Yana (later Saxon/The Master) and Martha is telling the Doctor about the watch, she says the Face of Boe told the Doctor that he wasn't alone.

It is the most pointless thing I've ever done in my entire life, and I could probably get through about 5 units of work in one night if I wanted to (this is supposed to take more than a year). However, my ICT ""teacher"" (read: glorified babysitter) is the most frustrating, pain-inducingly stupid person who has ever walked the planet. She glances at ""work"" and marks it based on how many words there are. The courses consist of nothing more than screenshotting documents that have nothing to do with ICT. We spent the whole of Year 9 making a brochure. At the start of Year 10, when I changed to a new teacher, she remarked it and I was moved down from distinction marks to pass marks. So I had to do most of it again. One of the less smart guys in the class did the whole thing in one day. I could, but it's so mind-numbingly pointless and boring that I consider listening to music to be better than doing this. It makes me want to kill someone, and it's even more frustrating that I probably won't be in school long enough to see these changes made. It's really difficult to express in words how pissed off I am that these horribly incompetent ""teachers"" are allowed to keep their jobs - almost every time I hand in my work I have to show her where each individual mark is, because she's too stupid to find the bloody things herself. /rant",0,1326319844,null,0,false,0,c3g8xab,t3_oc338,t1_c3g8xab,t3_oc338,null,1428163642,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"In English law, if a consumer buys a dodgy product, it is the retailer who is liable to reimburse the consumer and pay for any consequential loss. The retailer can then potentially take legal action against the manufacturer or their supplier for breach of contract, but if as in this case the manufacturer has gone bust then the retailer is SOL, they should have exercised more care when procuring products they're selling on to the general public.

I'm not sure of the legal implications in this case, since there's specific laws covering cosmetic surgery/private medical treatment obviously. However, at the end of the day it's still a business so I don't see why the Sales of Goods and Services legislation shouldn't apply

Edit: A couple of other thoughts that come to mind, the private clinics could potentially try and argue that the implants are not unsafe and so they're not under obligation to replace them, but at the end of the day they were sold as medical grade silicone and that's not the case so there's still grounds for claiming the goods are 'not as described'. Also the statute of limitations on consumer cases is 6 years, and since these operations were carried out as early as 2001, in some cases the clinic wouldn't be legally obliged to do anything (under normal consumer legislation at least, not sure about any other laws or regulations).

Secondly, since the implants were checked and approved by the MHRA, if the clinics got sued by the customers, there may potentially be grounds for the clinics to take legal action against the government for certifying the implants in the first place, so this could end up costing the taxpayers the same or more. What I can see happening is a back room agreement being struck between the government and the clinics whereby the clinics pay a certain sum into a compensation fund, and the government agrees to do the replacements under the NHS",0,1326323121,null,0,true,0,c3g9k22,t3_oco9y,t1_c3g9k22,t1_c3g827p,null,1428163939,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You can choose to take out a student loan to pay your fees. The amount of loan you can get does not depend on your own income and that of your parents or your husband, wife or partner, as appropriate.

&gt;You may not be entitled to tuition fees if you are repeating any period of study or have done a course of higher education before.

&gt;Sometimes an institution may charge fees that are different from the standard rates. If you are not sure about the fees that your institution will charge, you should check with them before you accept the place they have offered you.

I don't think Kompany's red card was legit but I'll take it.  They are going to be in trouble without their african players over the next month.

* Good move by kenny to switch to the 5-3-1-1. Really made us compact at the back and negated their wide men, plus without spearing it was better to have a 3rd center back to stop silva.

If you can find people with all those skills then you'll also find that they can command a good salary, so why would they teach?

As a nation we seem to have taken the approach of teach it to yourself, which is great if you're motivated, have access to the relevant hardware, software and literature (less of an issue now) and have the time.

true,samjengland,english,Cumbria,"It’s not about the speed; it’s about capacity, and future-proofing too. With passenger numbers increasing 10% each year, our victorian railway network is bursting at the seams. Without significant infrastructure works like platform lengthening, re-signalling (whilst the line is in use – to avoid extensive closures) capacity increases wouldn’t be possible. HS2 is the only solution in the long term.

Pricing, again is a non-issue, as others have said in these comments. You can get a £5 off peak advance ticket from Birmingham to London on a slow stopping train that takes 1hr 50 minutes. You can pay £40-£80 (off-peak vs anytime) for a Virgin Trains fast service which takes 1hr 10 minutes. I pay extra, and so do most other people I know. I am not affluent, and nor are the majority of other people who use those services. Three trains run per hour, and the line is used to capacity, and train after train leaves Birmingham New St full with standing room only to Euston – the same in the other direction. In the next 10-20 years we need huge capacity increases, and as I said – HS2 is the only option.

To respond to the issue of subjectivity. I made it quite clear that I’m being subjective. This is not an objective report – this is an opinion piece. I am a rail enthusiast so I am openly bias to rail travel – and as I said I am no economist, but I do believe railways are still integral to our economy. Without railways, we’d struggle a lot.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"He stated that Scotland would keep a 90% share of the UK's resources, but would pay only 8% of the debt, which is obviously ridiculous.

Also, he claims that the failure of the *independant* bank of Scotland was down to English mismanagement, and so refuses to pay the nearly 200 billion pound debt on that.",0,1326332169,null,0,false,0,c3gb54m,t3_ocuii,t1_c3gb54m,t1_c3g9ria,null,1428164762,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
true,[deleted],null,null,"Best: Eleventh Hour (adorable Matt Smith is adorable), Impossible Planet/Satan Pit (PERFECTLY produced and written), Smith and Jones (Martha is AWESOME), Turn Left (DonnaDonnaDonna ^^), Midnight (brr), Fear Her (I really liked it! I don't understand why people don't like it, I thought it was very sweet)

Worst: Love and Monsters (it would have been a fine one-off except for the Doctor bringing back Ursula...to live forever as a slab of concrete???), Curse of the Black Spot (Neat idea, horribly executed), Wedding of River Song (wayy underplayed for a finale, should have been a two-parter), Victory of the Daleks (TECHNICOLOR DALEKS WHY? Although it was partially redeemed by the WW2 jets in space)

Best Season: Season 5, then 4, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1 (not a fan of Eccleston, have to say)

Favourite Finale: Season 2 for sure! Season 3's was ok although the JesusDoctor was a bit much, and Season 4 just made no sense to me.

Favourite Companion: Amy and Rory, so much :D followed by Martha, then Donna, then Rose.",0,1326332171,null,0,false,0,c3gb554,t3_ocscd,t1_c3gb554,t3_ocscd,null,1428164762,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4
