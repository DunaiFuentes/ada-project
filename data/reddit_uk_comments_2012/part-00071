Your deposit does not cover carpets or basic cleaning unless you have left the property in a terrible mess. That is part of ""wear n' tear""  which the landlord will have to cover through rent. 

At this point your best course of action is to keep everything in writing. Politely state that you would like your deposit back in full and give a date as to when you want it returned. State that if it is not returned by the said date that you will take the matter to the small claims court. Wait for the response. 

If the landlord doesn't respond, simply file a claim with the small claims court. Its relatively quick and easy. If you landlord does response and offers a lower amount or claims damage to the property, its up to you to make a decision whether you think its fair or not.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You know, patronising people is never the best way of attempting to win them over to your point of view. I've seen you do this repeatedly, over the years. Your ideas get challenged, you feel threatened, and you revert to ""Well, I'm going to patronise them"" mode, telling them that they know nothing, that they are idiots, that they believe propaganda, etc. It's not winning you any converts.

I am not trying to win anyone over. I am expressing shock and disappointment at how willingly people will follow a false narrative which is against their interests. If you're so unaware as to follow and even promote your narrative, I can't do anything. There are people who could ""win over"" others, I don't pretend to be one. 

By the by, you don't understand a thing I say. I assumed wrongly that that was implicit. Obviously you understand things, you wouldn't be using language otherwise. Presumably, you understand lots of things. At least I am honest in telling you I think you're an idiot yet you think I am an idiot and won't say so directly. 

&gt;New technologies create work as well as making older jobs obsolete. The last 30 years should have been ample demonstration of this. 

You are living in a different world to me. The last thirty years have demonstrated that businesses will outsource to the place with the cheapest labour and least regulation. Your lifestyle is subsidised by lending, the wages in our society are going down in real terms except for the richest few. Our society can't feed itself and can't produce the energy that we consume. The only reason we have good lifestyles is because we are living (as I say over and over again, and I am not rebuffed on this) off the crumbs dropped from the tables of the financial fraudsters. The economic house of cards is teetering right now, not even the craven press can hide this yet, to you it's all roses. 


&gt;And really, what people want to avoid is a situation where people simply choose not to work, and end up consuming the tax revenue generated by the people that do work. Revenue that could be spent on health care, infrastructure, and all the other things that people expect the state to maintain. 

Money is not essential to public services. Actually, you could remove money altogether and society could operate well. Money is just a game invented a few hundred years ago. 

&gt;If we have a situation where there are no consequences for those that simply choose not to work, then the tax burden generated by those people becomes unsustainable. In fact, it's unsustainable right now.

The tax system is based on a mathematical game called the economy that just happened to become the basis for wealth distribution. It doesn't take a great deal of imagination to consider there may be other ways of doing business but you insist on banging on about a dead and meaningless system that evolved to serve others at your expense (assuming you are not a banker or one of those Chelsea wankers on the telly). 

 
Civilisation is unsustainable. Oil is finished. 


&gt;These are your suppositions, and I do not agree with them, nor do I agree with your subsequent conclusions.

Your intellectual framework appears too much confined to the consensus view and you're limiting your capacity to disagree with me in a substantive fashion. If you could do so, you would be right. But if you disagree with me because you can't see beyond Western industrial civilisation and its mythology, you are pissing into the wind. 

&gt;What does any of that have to do with your proposed ""make work"" society, in which we don't dare adopt a technology if might cost someone their job?

I haven't proposed anything of the sort. Actually, I don't even understand what you mean by ""make work"" society.

If you want me to clarify something, just fucking ask.  

My comments about the Tube drivers being replaced by machines are made in the context of an economy where most people seem to think that being employed should be a prerequisite to a decent lifestyle. If you believe this to be the case, why would you support sacking them just so they can join the ranks of the unemployed? Surely you would balance utility and technological possibilities against ordinary human needs and benefits such as having an experienced person or two to keep an eye on everyone jammed together in the sweaty hell cigar coffins under London? If the train doesn't need a driver, howabout a couple of Tube Wardens to walk up and down and just see that everything is fine and to help incase of the odd emergency? I think that would be valuable and would gladly pay £50,000 per annum for this. I would also bring back bus conductors who have no technological utility and introduce more adults to work in the school system. 

&gt;There are hundreds of jobs now which did not exist in 1800, and would not have existed had the Luddites got their wish. Those jobs have replaced other jobs which are now obsolete. By the sounds of it, you would have us hang on to obsolete technology to preserve obsolete jobs, which it would be entirely optional to work in. Insane.

I don't think you understand what the Luddites were for and also you don't understand what industrialisation did to ordinary people. I invite you to clarify what you think the Luddites' cause was before I further insult you. 

EDIT: Plus, hundreds of jobs were eliminated in 1800 due to deliberate policies made by people who wanted to force people off the land and into factories. 

You don't likely understand sanity either. Blah blah, Plato's cave, the Matrix, blahblahblah. 


&gt;And yet you have no sane answers. Nor does anyone else. No one invented ""the system"". It grew organically, and yet you always speak in terms of malevolent design. There was no malevolent designer(s). And ""The System"" you speak of has brought us far more than 100 years of prosperity. 


No one invented it but it's not ""organic"". It is malevolent. ""Design"" is, perhaps metaphoric or maybe there is an evolutionary force that has something of a life-force to it. I really don't know. Either way, there is a system. And there could be other systems. Part of me believes that if the masses resist the system there can be change. Since the system is destroying life as we know it, I would feel better if more people believed this or at least considered the possibility. 

The prosperity you and I enjoy (assuming you a subject of a rich nation) comes off the back of the horrendous abuse and exploitation of the British and American empires. We live comfortably as members of the wealthiest ten percent of Earth dwellers. This wealth is extracted from the other 90% of humanity and from the ecosystem at large. If you deny this, I will insult you again. 


&gt;We are where we are, and we have to adapt what we have to meet the demands of the present and the near future. It's what people have always done. Flawed Utopian dreams that centre on reinventing society are a waste of time and effort.

It's not what people have always done. For fuck's sake, agriculture has existed for barely ten thousand years of humanity's history. Are you just baiting me now? What people have always done is gone out together to kill a beastie and brought it back to the village and shared it out without prejudice. 

Meanwhile, we have likely gone into population overshoot whereby the oil that most food is made out of suddenly becomes scarce, people start starving and the weather goes haywire. This is not a secret. To suggest that picking apart the underpinnings of civilisation is utopian is to be wilfully ignorant.

&gt;3.4. Conclusions

&gt;• If the UK were to opt for EEA membership, it would retain access to the EU’s Single Market in goods
and services. However, outside the EU’s customs union, access for goods could be impeded by complex
rules of origin. Switching to such a system could introduce a new administrative burden to
merchandise trade with EU countries, which remains the UK’s biggest goods export market.

&gt;• Outside the EU customs union, EEA member states have the ability to negotiate and conclude their
own FTAs with non-EU countries. The UK would no longer benefit from the EU’s market size in
negotiations but greater independence in trade talks could become increasingly attractive should EU
liberalisation stall or if the EU were to prevent the UK from taking advantage of future growth
opportunities outside Europe.

&gt;• Inside the EEA, the UK would remain bound by most EU laws, particularly those with a significant
impact on its economy such as social and employment regulation and financial services regulation.
However, the UK would have less democratic control over these rules than it has in the EU, without
the right to vote on them and with only limited formal influence in shaping them.

&gt;• If the UK was in the EEA, it would no longer be subject to the EU’s agricultural, fish and EU-wide
regional policies.

&gt;• Whether the UK would have to contribute to the EU budget is an open question. If Norway is a
precedent, it is likely the UK would have to contribute in one way or another, for example via a
bilateral development fund, although substantially less than it does now.

What it does propose is that the UK would be best suited fashioning its own EU relationship, not adopting outright a Norway solution, or a Swiss Solution, or a Turkish solution, but a UK solution along those lines.  If anything it proposes a UK Norway-heavy version with less financial service regulation. 

I'm a Eurosceptic and I've never been under the illusion that the exact same Norwegian deal would be on the table and I don't recall anybody else claiming as much.  The UK would always contribute more than Norway contributes in costs through the EEA, but then again the UK should get so much more back.

Incidentally UKIP already advocates negotiating a trade agreement tailored for the UK.  ",0,1339419469,null,0,false,0,c4z29l7,t3_uvygv,t1_c4z29l7,t1_c4z1xuf,null,1429116513,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The downside of this is that dogs may not be taken to the vets but over a decade or so the pool of unchipped dogs will be massively reduced and almost all breeding will only be done by licensed and heavily regulated breeders.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;That visitbritain link is trash.

Only if you're working from a predetermined opinion. You've repeatedly complained about it not dealing with figures you want, and seem to assume that it's because they're trying to avoid your concerns...instead of acknowledging that you're ignoring the info it *does* provide.

&gt;yet you are using that as evidence to support your position - very weak evidence, shaky ground.

I prefer site links that have surveys and the like within them as opposed to repeatedly offering links to my own summaries and calling them 'evidence' (which appears to be what you've been doing elsewhere). You can complain about the postcard survery all you like - but until you can provide real evidence of your own, only people that already agree with you will listen.

&gt;For something of such great importance the queen isn't that iconic. ~10% picked the queen.

Again, you're implying that because the Queen isn't the number one choice, then the royals have no value. Doesn't work like that - the fact that *anyone* chose the Queen illustrates that your assertion that the royals are unpopular enough to make no difference to site visits.

&gt;Have you anything else? If yes, show me, if no, you are on shaky ground.

You haven't provided any links of your own yet to show that tourists are indifferent to the royals (and therefore do not spend any $ because of them) to back your assertions. Lets deal with that first.

&gt;if Buckingham Palace was empty and actually open all year with far more rooms accessible it is safe to conclude more revenue would be generated.

It is not safe to conclude this at all. Explain, for example, why anyone bothered visiting it before when the only option was to stand outside the gates. Or alternatively, show how the numbers wouldn't go up even further if the entirety of BP was opened with the royal connection still in place.

&gt;There was and people got arrested - before they could even protest. Thought crime.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well if you read it you weren't being genuine when you said, *""as the report shows that is not beneficial at all""*, as the report specifically balances both costs and benefits of the Norwegian model.

In its summation the article argues that the UK should renegotiate so it is still in the customs union which Norway is not, outside market related legislation which Norway is part of, but outside CAP/CFP like Norway.

The report makes sure to mention that there are distinct benefits to the Norwegian model that should be recognised, and when you claim to know what most Eurosceptics want the majority of Eurosceptics amongst the Conservative backbenches want a renegotiation of the UK's EU responsibilities/role, so not the Norwegian model, and UKIP argues for a negotiating a fresh trade agreement, so not the Norwegian model again but more in line with the Swiss model.  Removing the Brussels regulation is a major hallmark of UKIP and the Norwegian model doesn't do that.

&gt;Edit: UKIP are the ones who go on about democratic legitimacy and all these stupid EU laws, so they want in the EU with members of parliament, still abiding by EU laws? I thought they were the ones who wanted nothing to do with it.

What?  UKIP is quite clear they want to negotiate a trade agreement and leave the EU altogether.

UKIP doesn't want the Norwegian model.  Conservative Eurosceptics don't want the Norwegian model.  Where are you getting that most sceptics want the Norwegian model?  They like the benefits it brings, which the report mentions, but the majority wants a UK model, which both this report suggests and the Conservatives have hinted at.

Are you going to give these patrols right-of-entry as well?  Because they'll need it to find all the puppy-farms where the bitches are constantly pregnant and never see the light of day, or a vet.  These are the places that churn out staffies and other 'hard dog' breeds, and are perfectly happy to hand them over to random teenage chavs for fifty quid.  Why destroy the dog?  Fair enough if it's been out savaging babies, but destroying a dog because it's not got a chip is more than a little harsh.  And as for passing the costs of destruction back to the owner, if they can't afford £30 for a chip, do you really think they'll have the £100 or so it costs to have a dog put to sleep and disposed of?

Responsible breeders (and rescues) already offer microchipping and most rescues will insist on spaying a dog before it is re-homed (as well as home checks etc). All your hypothetical solution would do is penalise the poor, and force back-room breeders further underground.

Instead, as well as my comments above, I would suggest that similar to programs run by charities such the Blue Cross who provide spaying and chipping 'at cost', that a dog owners license requires a small yearly fee (£20-£50 depending on the number of dogs, low enough that payment by instalments is low enough to be affordable, but not so low as to be insignificant) the proceeds of which go towards providing at-cost or free training, chipping and spaying for owners along with discounted vet costs or pet insurance, a sort of National Insurance for pets. Have it paid for directly out of benefits payments or by direct debit.  Any additional proceeds could be used to fund local rescues and/or dog wardens as well as 'dog zone' in local recreation spaces.  Owners without a license should be given a reasonable amount of time to obtain one, or face having their animal seized (not destroyed, it's hardly the dog's fault) and potentially re-homed with someone who has a license.",0,1339425159,null,0,false,0,c4z375g,t3_uvttn,t1_c4z375g,t1_c4z2n9q,null,1429117043,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

People like you even pushed the idea that postcards show how important the queen is, which is utterly false because out of 25,000 people only 2500 picked the queen.

I don't have to provide anything. Monarchists claim that the actual monarch is a significant driver of tourism without any significant evidence, in your case almost no evidence. My position is that I believe that should the monarch be removed tomorrow tourism would be largely unaffected. The buildings would remain, the history would remain, and only 33% are here on holiday anyway (as opposed to business or visiting relations), of those 33% perhaps 10% would pick the queen on a postcard (whatever that means). There's no evidence that the queen is a deciding factor regarding choosing a holiday destination. There might be some that do this, I'm not saying it is impossible, but it is certainly not a significant factor when talking about equality of law, wealth, land, information and influence, and whether or a monarchy has legitimacy.

You turn around and then say prove it! Prove the monarchy doesn't do [x] is asking me to prove a negative. It's like saying god exists because you can't prove otherwise. I can't prove god exists, but then again theists cannot provide convincing evidence for its existence. Therefore it is safe to dismiss the religious.

Monarchy operates in the same way. Proponents don't have anything other than emotion and ideology to back their cause so they exaggerate tourism to try and make for a convincing argument. Just like seeing Jesus' face on a piece of toast, you are seeing this postcard nonsense as helpful to your cause. It's making you look foolish especially when only 10% picked the queen. If this is a true indicator of importance that implies that if we had to get rid of the castles, the buses or the queen, we should get rid of the queen.

1)  The first opportunity Torres went to do his 'trademark' pass around the keeper.  This almost always works, it worked against Valdes.  However, Buffon is arguably a much better keeper than Valdes and is known for studying tendencies of players and acting upon them.  A world class keeper stopped it, this was not bad finishing but great 'keeping.

2)  The second opportunity again he was trying to beat Buffon who had closed down the breakaway very well, he tried to lob it over him and missed by about seven inches.  I'm not sure he could have done better on the run to be honest.

I take your point about his form. Nando's finishing was poor yesterday, and some of his decision making against Buffon was terrible. But to call it a ""death spiral"" is sensationalist in the extreme, and to blame him solely for the match ending in a draw is entirely unfair. 

Fair play he fluffed a few chances, but Spain dropped 2 points because Del Bosque played with what amounted to a 4-6-0 for the first hour of the match, and this formation proved incapable of breaking down the very well disciplined Italian side.

If you can't afford to look after it then yes you shouldn't own a pet, if this is synonymous with being poor then the answer is yes.

As these patrols would be done by the police then yes they would have right of entry.

&gt;if they can't afford £30 for a chip, do you really think they'll have the £100 or so it costs to have a dog put to sleep and disposed of?

Well if they've failed to due to irresponsibility then the £300-500 fees for destruction should be recoverable for them plus any fines which need to be imposed. There needs to be a stronger penalty than just the destruction of the dog.

As for some way of making an already low charge affordable, I really don't see the point of subsidising people so that they can own pets. If there is some form of help it should be managed purely by the charitable sector and should have no government funding. Pets are a luxury item and we don't need to provide financial mollycoddling.

As for the destruction of animals, it's a pity but it's the only effective way as the government shouldn't be responsible for taking on the financial burden of people who can't manage simple things like getting their dog chipped. If people are really that bothered by the destruction aspect then once again charities will step in.

Instead of providing any links that aren't your own opinions?

&gt;It was the monarchists that brought up visitbritain

You don't have to be a monarchist to work out that the royals are popular with many Britons *and* tourists. What you *do* have to do if you don't agree is demonstrate how popularity &lt;&gt; tourist $.

&gt;claiming it showed how important the monarchy was.

It doesn't claim, it illustrates by survery/ statistics. There's a difference. Alternatively, provide your own survery showing that this is not the case.

&gt;People like you even pushed the idea that postcards show how important the queen is

People like me provide links. But apparently, now a survery of 25,000 is 'pushing the idea' over 'statistical proof of popularity'. This is why you need to provide surverys to the alternative, because trying to pick apart one that's already going against the opinion you seem to think tourists have (based on...er...) isn't cutting it. And like I pointed out already, you could use your logic to dismiss *any* of the choices that weren't number 1.

&gt;I don't have to provide anything.

Actually, you do if you want your interpretation to be counted as anything other than speculation, because cherry picking the bits you want (and trying to invalidate the bits you don't) is really working out well.

&gt; Monarchists claim that the actual monarch is a significant driver of tourism

It isn't just Monarchists, actually. Better put that dymo away until you've proved the royals aren't popular with tourists, then.

&gt;without any significant evidence, in your case almost no evidence.

Because I visited one site, and am still waiting for you to provide any evidence to the contrary before I bother looking for more. Odd that you're unable to really invalidate my 'almost no evidence' with *any of your own*. And that's just going by the VB website - do you really, seriously think all those royal masks in the London shops go unsold, for example?

&gt;My position is that I believe that should the monarch be removed tomorrow tourism would be largely unaffected. 

For which you haven't provided a single, credible basis. And you're not really thinking it through anyway - for example, no Queen = no changing of the guard/ trooping the colour...that's two things people go to BP to see. Want to keep them around anyway? Be prepared to argue with people that would no doubt insist that they're a waste of money too.

&gt; of those 33% perhaps 10% would pick the queen on a postcard (whatever that means). 

It means the royals are popular. If you're having that much trouble dismissing postcard popularity, or finding any evidence of your own to dismiss the popularity of the royals, it just illustrates that you're overlaying your opinion onto that of the tourists and not much else.

&gt;There's no evidence that the queen is a deciding factor regarding choosing a holiday destination.

Indeed - but you'd be naive to assume that the royals have no influence over what sites people visit in London (outside of obvious choices like the ToL), unless you can demonstrate that there's no connection between royal popularity/ number of visitors. And it's interesting that you're now going back to people picking the UK as a destination in the first place, instead of how they'd affect the number of visitors to royal sites once they're here.

&gt;but it is certainly not a significant factor when talking about equality of law, wealth, land, information and influence, and whether or a monarchy has legitimacy.

No, it isn't. Because that's not what we're talking about.

&gt;You turn around and then say prove it! 

Because I've provided statistics that you haven't. You've asked for proof - there you go. When asked to provide some yourself, you start dancing instead.

&gt;Prove the monarchy doesn't do [x] is asking me to prove a negative.

Your assertion is a negative - and actually, the OP title is 'prove the claim that 'the queen brings in so much money from tourism' - then you've asserted that the sites would have antendees anyway, so I've pointed out that the popularity of the queen = $ from tourists that are here. You seem to dsipute this, so I'm asking you to provide proof that the popularity of the Queen and the attendance numbers at royal sites are not connected. Stop dancing and acknowledge that your assertions are based on your opinion of the monarchy, rather than fact.

&gt; It's like saying god exists because you can't prove otherwise. 

No, it's asking for evidence to back up your claims when evidence already exists that disputes it.

&gt;Monarchy operates in the same way. 

No, it doesn't.

&gt;Proponents don't have anything other than emotion and ideology to back their cause so they exaggerate tourism to try and make for a convincing argument. 

You mean like critics that don't have any evidence to back up their alternate view? In any case, this has already been demonstrated not to be true.

&gt;Just like seeing Jesus' face on a piece of toast, you are seeing this postcard nonsense as helpful to your cause.

So now the Queen being the third most popular choice is now the same as seeing Jesus' face on a piece of toast. This speaks volumes - you're now citing God and divine intervention rather than acknowledge that your entire outlook on this subject is based on speculation.

&gt;It's making you look foolish especially when only 10% picked the queen

Not as foolish as not providing any statistics or surveys to support your assertions *at all*, or making leaps of logic that would invalidate half the entries in that list.

&gt; If this is a true indicator of importance that implies that if we had to get rid of the castles, the buses or the queen, we should get rid of the queen.

What was that you were saying about exaggeration?

&gt;It might mean something to you but I haven't got a clue what you are on about. 

Linux users account for around 5% of desktops in the world. If I remember correctly, Apple (OSX) users account for 10%. You wouldn't assume this by how loud they are on the internet, but it ultimately doesn't make any difference, they're minority operating systems.

&gt;I doubt many others will. 

Again with the attitude of 'if you don't know about it, nobody else does'. Amazing.

&gt;I presume you are still stuck paying for windows. This is not 1998 anymore, computing has moved on.

Wow, do carry on - your computer knowledge surpasses even your knowledge of the monarchy and is helping your cause no end.

true,victoriaj,uk,London,"It doesn't make a difference to the right to have the deposit returned minus fair deductions, but it does make a difference regarding whether the laws regarding deposit schemes apply. A legal requirement to use the deposit scheme would allow either for the landlord to pay into the scheme now allowing for free mediation if they both agreed, or if the landlord outright refused to put the money into the scheme a claim for the return of the deposit plus 3 TIMES the deposit as a penalty. You want to know if that's possible before taking legal action, you also generally use a different form to make the deposit claim (and pay a flat fee rather than being based on the amount claimed), though it isn't standardised across all courts. 

The written tenancy can give extra rights but not take them away. If the landlord was not in fact resident, and you had sole use of any part of the property you are likely to be an assured shorthold tenant. The deposit scheme rules will apply, and the tenancy cannot take that away. However you may have problems showing he didn't live there, particularly as the tenancy could be seen as evidence he did. 

You definitely need to get proper advice (CAB, law centre, some local councils offer advice to private tenants through their housing service). The deposit scheme is complicated, and the current situation is determined by a complete mess of an attempt at legislation (which didn't even determine how a person would take legal action) and case law. I was pretty much an expert in this up until a year ago, and am not now up to date on the case law. A year ago it wasn't going in the tenants favour, and was leading to situations where if the landlord suddenly paid into the deposit scheme the day before the hearing tenants were losing the case and in a small minority of courts were even having costs awarded against them. This may finally have been standardised throughout the UK as more cases went to higher courts. 

It also leads to a situation where you may need to take legal action re. the deposit scheme, have the landlord pay the money into the scheme (with or without a 3 times penalty direct to yourself) and then have the landlord refuse mediation through the scheme and have to take small claims action regarding the deposit anyway.

&gt;At one point, Xavi Hernandez was shouting at Arbeloa to press Giaccherini, but the
&gt;Spanish full-backs were reluctant to do so, as they were also supposed to be providing &gt;cover at the back. If they’d moved up and effectively become wing-backs themselves,
&gt;they would have left an unwanted 2 v 2 situation at the back, and with Cassano and &gt;Balotelli eagerly working the wide zones (particularly the space in behind Arbeloa), this 
&gt;would have been too risky. Instead, they stayed at home, and Italy could pass the ball &gt;easily across the back five, and then into the middle for Pirlo, who was often closed down &gt;quickly. He looked to get the ball to Balotelli and Cassano, while further long passes came &gt;from De Rossi, who hit some good diagonals.

true,r-cubed,null,null,"Hm, well some other things you might like to consider then. You are allowed to rank your top college preferences, but it is no guarantee you'll get them (you may already know this). If your selections do not have room for you, you'll be 'slotted' into another college. So the appeal of small colleges may be offset by the lower probability of selection. 

Also consider access. As a Cambridge University student you can go into any college you like. No one is going to stop you from, say, waltzing into Emma and sitting on the bench near the pond to study. This does not mean the restricted access--ie, you can't hang out at the Trinity Library without someone letting you in. But any ""public area"" you are free to be (and since you'll have a cam card, you won't need to pay entry fees!).

As for my personal perspective of the colleges you listed: Pembroke, my favorite college architecturally. Clare was nice, but quite compact and popular with tourists. Queens felt very isolated despite being a river college, and a mix of interesting architecture, I enjoyed it very much. Perhaps most people don't realize they are walking past it. Cats, I was ""meh"" about. I enjoyed the architecture and I had a couple of dinners there with some mates from the rugby squad, but I wasn't over the moon about it.


edit: and as was stated, you are not guaranteed housing as a graduate student. Cambridge guarantees 3 years of housing for undergrads, not so for the graduates. Also as stated, most times graduate housing is not within the walls of the college itself. Except for graduate colleges, obviously (so that's a +1 for them, really). So you may find yourself with your dream college but actually living quite a ways away. 

In the end though I don't view this as a big problem. Most of your time will be spent at your faculty anyway. I knew lots of graduate students who secured flats near their faculties, as that access was more important.

Italy's 3-5-2 was molded around protecting Pirlo, and we do not have any player of his style. It worked so well against Spain because they played with 6 midfielders. If Spain had played with wingers and a striker, the Italian lack of width would have been exposed. 

Lastly, playing styles are only as good as the personnel involved. Spain made a mistake by starting with an overly conservative lineup, and even then they were still level before putting on Navas and Torres. The Tiki-taka style requires having 1 striker who is very good at holding the ball. Barca played without Villa while Spain started with no strikers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It means the royals are popular. If you're having that much trouble dismissing postcard popularity, or finding any evidence of your own to dismiss the popularity of the royals, it just illustrates that you're overlaying your opinion onto that of the tourists and not much else.

I'll describe my journey regarding the following question: 'is the monarchy a significant draw for tourism?'. For starters it is an unfair question because I can never prove without a doubt how deconstruction of the monarchy alters tourism without actually deconstructing the monarchy.  I have to look at trends and infer meaning. Secondly, one has to disassociate the effects of the monarch from the historical legacy of the monarchy. One doesn't need an acting monarch to make places like the Tower of London any more significant.

The obvious place to start is with tourist motivation so I spent some time on the UK government website looking through national statistics regarding monarchy. I found the following data regarding international travellers: [~33% are here on holidays where as ~66% are motivated by business, visiting relatives, friends or for some other reason](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ott/travel-trends/2010/index.html). I think it is safe to conclude that removing the monarch would have no effect on 66% of travellers, business will still be business and family will still be family. That leaves 33% of people that could have potentially chosen Britain solely because their is a monarchy, but it would be absurd to think all 33% would do so. I have at least conclusively proved that the monarch is not the driver of tourism.

The next problem is figuring out what proportion of those 33% are motivated by the monarch. One method would be to look at [the most popular tourist sites](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/feb/23/british-tourist-attractions-visitor-figures). We see that no royal attraction makes the top ten, the first is the Tower of London ranked 14th. What do we know about the tower of London? There is no residing monarch. That doesn't look good for the cause.

So far I am not seeing the great significance pro-monarchists insist is there. What evidence are they providing? Okay, [visitbritain](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx) seems a prominent source (perhaps the only one). The main claim of 500m seems significant, however, it includes St Paul's Cathedral, British Maritime Museum, West Minster Abbey, historic castles (without a resident monarch), and some castle ruins. The article is blurring the line between the actual monarch and as it states the *'spell cast by the Monarchy’s 1,000 year history'*, and it doesn't make clear what this 500m is but it is obvious that they have included sources of revenue that would still be there if the monarchy ended at Elizabeth. In some cases like with St Paul's they have taking something unrelated to the monarchy and included it in the data. I don't know for sure because they haven't published the full report and chosen the 'best bits' for the article, talking of which...

The survey seems a little more interesting, but they don't link us to the whole report. Does that mean they are hiding something? The article also contains to references to nowhere [1] and [2]. Let us consider the following:

&gt;  Nearly three-quarters of respondents said that they would be likely to visit a castle or stately home were they to visit Britain and 60% said that they would be likely to seek out places associated with the Royal Family or British monarchy.

Again the article is conflating 'castles and stately homes' which is history, with the ruling monarch. 40% don't even care for anything royal. And next the postcards. For me this is just absurd to use as evidence for the importance of the monarch. 

&gt;  Then potential tourists were also asked to choose from 15 postcards that they would send to communicate that they were in Britain. They ranged from The London Eye, Tea to  Red Phone Boxes. The icon picked by the most respondents was a red double decker bus (24%) followed by a stone castle by the sea (20%). But the third most popular choice, at 11% of respondents, was Queen Elizabeth II...

Personally I reject this as evidence of anything and no conclusions can safely be made beyond perhaps tentative advice for shopkeepers: don't stock many postcards of a royal theme because 90% of tourists prefer something different. If anything this undermines the importance tourists are supposed to feel for the monarchy that monarchists insist is there. If you insist on presenting a 10% 'approval rating' amongst card pickers, then you are doing you argument a diservice because I'll point to the same survey that shows busses are more important than the queen.

If we look to a country like France that discontinued its monarchy, we find 'royal' buildings that generate more revenue and attract more visitors. [Palais du Louvre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_du_Louvre) would be the direct equivalent to Buckingham Palace.

Because there is no real evidence so far I reject the claim that the monarchy cannot be abolished because it is such a driver of tourism, at best it is a minor benefit and certainly no justification to allow a family special legal and economic privileges like not having to pay corporation tax on their business, not having to pay income tax, or not having to pay inheritance tax. If you can provide stronger evidence then I'll reconsider but until then I shall remain skeptical. [The OP that asked the question did a summary of what he found out,](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/uoyzf/can_anyone_actually_prove_the_claim_that_the/) and decided the tourism argument was thoroughly unconvincing.

IMHO it can be done:

1) make the chipping process free of charge, funded by taxes on dog food

2) vets must check each dog for a chip prior to every treatment/checkup

3) if a dog at the vet lacks one it must be fitted prior to treatment

4) if the dog's health would be jeopardised by a chip it'll be staying overnight anyway and should receive one before release to the owner

Part 2 offers interesting side-potential; I'd link it to a health database allowing dogs to have the same medical case-history that humans get.

Hm, seem we're having different conversations, here. I am talking about work experience programs in general, not just those in prisons, and how they devalue actual labour and increase unemployment.

Shelf stackers is referring to those ""work experience"" schemes tescos got in a bit of a media tizzy about recently, for hiring shelf stackers through work experience programs. Essentially, they were stacking their shelves at the tax payers expense.

&gt; Did they commit a crime accidentally? In which case I have some sympathy for your position.

Yes, but that makes no difference. Both from a utilitarian perspective and a humane perspective, the idea of charging prisoners room and board is unacceptable.

&gt; Being required to work doesn't mean you're a slave. I'm required to work inasmuch as I wish to eat without stealing or rummaging through bins for food. Admittedly we'd reduce prison costs considerably if we required prisoners to do economically viable work and only fed them if they paid enough but I really don't see where you're going with that sort of reasoning.

I have to see my provider (currently CDG/Avanta) one a month, sometimes twice, and have to show that I've applied for a minimum of 3 jobs per week.

I was fortunate that I haven't had to do any work placements.

6 per day is a joke. If there were 27 suitable vacancies available each week then there wouldn't be any fucking unemployment.

I've used (in order of preference):

jobseekers.direct.gov.uk

jobstoday.co.uk

uk.jobrapido.com

jobsite.co.uk

monster.co.uk

TBH a lot of the positions I didn't apply for; I just put them on my Job Search form to satisfy the benefit office/provider. The majority of jobs were unsuitable, totally shit, split shifts or under 16 hours, agencies farming CV's or, of course, already filled.

I'm not work shy; there simply isn't enough jobs to go round. I took a break from my career in IT when I became a single parent and quickly fell behind (There isn't much call for Win2k server admin's or 9518/200 EPOS engineers any more). By the time my son was old enough to look after himself I didn't have any references to offer employers which was a real problem in getting interviews.

**BUT** I'm starting permanent work next week, so will be signing off. It's taken me a while (I've been applying for this job repeatedly for a year now) but it's finally paid off. 

I'm hoping I'll get a few weeks run on, at least with housing benefit, but the lady who I sign with doesn't know, so I have to phone the main centre and ask them when I sign off.

King Valdemar II of Denmark was on a campaign in Estonia, the campaign was going badly and it looked like the Danes would lose. At what seemed like the final battle for the Danes and where they would lose and be slaughtered, Dannebrog fell from the heavens onto the battlefield(most likely a lowly knight's banner that had been taken by the wind) and the Danes went on to win the battle against all the odds and ever since Dannebrog have been the flag of the Danish kings and later the flag of Denmark, I think the flag in the tree tries to represent Dannebrog's descend from heaven.

Fun fact 1: Dannebrog is the oldest national flag in the world.

Fun fact 2: Tallinn is believed by some to mean Danish Town because the battle took place at the site that is now Tallinn.

When I see pictures of this companion, I don't see anything I like. I don't see anything about her that makes her look like a ""perfect"" companion. What does that even look like, anyway? 


Everyone here is coming to the table with about the same amount of knowledge of her as a companion. You can research the actress and watch her entire reel, but that still gives you no clue how she'll interpret a specific character. You don't know what kind of storyline she has, what her personality is like, what she brings to the table. Everyone here is bursting with love for this character, but she hasn't done anything yet. So why is that okay, while my assessment is not?

You may not want to read that people don't like the new companion and consider it to be irrelevant, but that's because you have a different opinion. There are clearly other people, like myself, who have interest in discussing why she doesn't seem like a good companion. Yet if we do, we're apparently going to be downvoted - making our conversation less visible to potential new voices and bringing down our karma. I know, we're all supposed to pretend like we don't care about our karma, but come on, dude.

As far as I can guess, there is no layering in this piece which would mean you could do it as a beginner without having to invest in a kiln, just don't expect it to turn out so clean around the edges without ""bumps"" (burps) in the solder.

If you're buying tools (soldering iron, dremel or grinder or stone, pliers, glass cutter, flux remover, marker, etc), add a solid 200 to that number. To have it custom made, you'd really have to speak to the shop or person doing it, since it depends on how they individually price their work and value their time. The average cost for custom stained glass is $120 to $160 per square foot (a scale TARDIS design might take 2.8 square feet).

In fact, neither American English nor the Queen's English are completely akin to English circa 1776. Take the word grey. Also known as gray, in America. However, gray was commonly used in England until the 20th century as well. Fall was also once a very common way to refer to autumn in Britain, despite the fact that today fall is seen as an Americanism. Color with or instead of our was used in England as far back as the 15th century, and is arguably closer to the original Latin derivative. Most of the ou's in the English language mainly come from when the Normans arrived, so I guess the last pure English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons.

true,amsid,1953,Didier Drogba,"Formation is key. The UEFA Fantasy site this year is pretty flexible and people don't know about it. The highest scoring formation would likely be 2-5-3 or 3-4-3. Minimizing defenders and maximizing attackers can land you a higher score.

Also, stay away from defensive midfielders. Although talented, they won't score many goals, get many assists, and tend to get carded. For some reason Polanski is a popular choice, probably cause of his cheap price. I went ahead and picked him but found out he plays in the hole for Poland. I'll be looking to swap him for someone else if i can.

What I do is spend the least amount on my subs, so I can get better players. My bench is pretty much weaker defenders worth 4.0mil. I do the same with goalies. Take 1 keeper on a good team, and a backup keeper from another.

You start to pull away due to your captain choices and with your 4th/5th midfielders that can surprise. I'm hoping for Afellay to be the man for me.

Also, look to pickup players who are on form and have good matchups. (e.g. Dzagoev vs the untested Polish defence)",0,1339459033,null,0,1339459598,0,c4zb76f,t3_uwvf5,t1_c4zb76f,t1_c4zb3i6,null,1429120889,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Most business's that have owners that go to these events are looking to expand and you will stand out as the most pro-active applicant by a mile, especially if they haven't even put an advert out. 

The analogy that I think best characterises this approach is dating, sending a c.v to an advert is like messaging a hot girls on-line dating profile, you might get lucky, but you're one in a thousand and they have so many options that the power is with them. Going to a networking event is more like being the only guy in a nightclub full of drunk women and flirting with as many of them as possible.

SO....Spare Parts is great- Cybermen origins and 5th Doctor. The villain trilogy Omega, Davros, and Master with the 5th, 6th, and 7th Doctors respectively. Scherzo with Charley  and 8 (blows your mind). Natural History of Fear which also does, in a different way (it leads you on the whole time). Fires of Vulcan (7th) is a cool historical. Doctor Who and the Pirates (6th) is really good and seems silly for the first half, but then it gets serious. Flip-Flop a 7th Doctor story is really timey wimey.

The Jamie/6th Doctor trilogy is awesome: City of Spires, Wreck of the Titan, Legend of the Cybermen. The 7/Klein trilogy is also awesome- A Thousand Tiny Wings, Survival of the Fittest, Architects of History. Klein is a Nazi.

The I, Davros series which is Davros' life story is one of the most culturally layered and character-development heavy stories ever. And it's so awesome. Davros becomes a complex character/villain. 

Holy Terror is really good (6th Doctor), Loups-Garoux (5), Jubilee (6).

And if you like alternate continuity short stories, *Auld Mortality* kicks ass. First Doctor and Susan. Prompt: What if the Doctor and Susan never left Gallifrey? The guy playing the Doctor is SO Hartnell-ish and the original actress plays Susan.

However, given that this is a science fiction series, I don't see why they couldn't allegory it up on a different world. This would further let the writers play with the religious mythos generally and adapt whatever bits they liked to make their Time Lord messiah, rather than mucking about with actual religious texts.

That said, there's already quite a bit of allegory in Doctor Who, if you want to look for it. Also, as amusing an idea as this is, I like it better when it's obliquely suggested that the Doctor is someone really special, rather than making it really explicit. Like they did in A Good Man Goes to War, where the Doctor's reputation for the people of the Gamma Forest is a minor plot point, and that his influence has led the people of the forest to understand that the word ""doctor"" means ""fearsome warrior.""",0,1339473406,null,0,false,0,c4zeh75,t3_uxclk,t1_c4zeh75,t3_uxclk,null,1429122445,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Variola13,null,null,"I can only speak for the science side, but it is entirely possible to go straight in for a PhD without a Masters first, but it will depend on your grades and how much experience you have of research. Some universities/courses offer a 3+1, which essentially is a Masters in your first year the if you are good enough you carry straight on to do a PhD place for 3 years. 

As for good University, best thing to do is to check out the various websites that provide university rankings, [Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/gug/?CMP=KNGvccp1-university+league+tables+uk&amp;gclid=CKOjscuKyLACFUdlfAod-EuSYg), [Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2012/may/21/university-league-table-2013) etc and also sites like [WhatUni](http://www.whatuni.com/) because they often gives a student perspective. IMO one of the main factors in a University is what research they are focussing on and how much research they are doing, a uni where the supervisors are still actively researching and involved in their field is much better. 

As an international student, you might be eligible for some bursaries and scholarships too, I know my Uni in particular has quite a lot of financial help for students from USA and China ( Alumni awards etc) so that might be worth checking out too. 

My friend came straight in from California to do a PhD here in neuroscience, and to my knowledge she did not do a Masters, I can ask her for some more info if that would help. ",0,1339483050,null,0,false,0,c4zgdt4,t3_ux9va,t1_c4zgdt4,t3_ux9va,null,1429123324,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,thebrokenlute,tardis,TARDIS,"It may be true that it's not for you, but you stopped before it got better for that season. I would recommend trying the Tennant episodes. That actor had been studying The Doctor and all his quirkiness since the actor was 8 years old, so, his interpretation, in my opinion, is probably more thoroughly researched and executed with a control that none of the other actors had. 

Also, what you must understand is that yes, at first, the budget was not very big, so it's not gonna be all Michael Bay explosions. But if you can get past the low budget effects, give it another chance. For example, what hooked me was when it hit me that The Doctor sees everyone the same way, human or alien, good or bad (except the Daleks, but that's because the Daleks ARE bad), and that he when he encounters something that is different than him, he doesn't react with fear, but with curiosity, and to give it a chance to tell its story. The episode that did that for me was The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances duology (9th Doctor played by Christopher Eccleston). At first, I was freaked out, but at the conclusion, no spoilers, don't worry, I see the whole story of the Child, and the Doctor was the only one who saw through what I had glazed over.

What got me into this show is that I was going through a whole bunch of things that really got me down. My husband introduced me to this show to get my mind off of the bad things that were going on. I saw the first episode of the 9th Doctor (""Rose"") and thought it was dumb. But I kept at it, and it did get better. I was still trying to get into Matt Smith's Doctor (11th), and yesterday, when I finished ""The Girl Who Waited"", aaalllll the way to nearly the end of the season (6), did I finally ""get"" Matt Smith's interpretation of The Doctor.

While I am in general in favour of easier labour migration - while I live in a society that doesn't, you have to impose reasonable rules on non-native born people.

There has therefore been an issue of perception that people migrate to the UK for economic reasons (as opposed to asylum claims) and boost the wookpool at the bottom of the rung - where there is already amply supply of native-born workers - and thus causes social conflict.

It is not unreasonable in that situation for the government to clamp down on economic migration into a pool of labour that is already oversupplied, and to discourage the setting up of permanent residence by such people.

It would help if economic migration for short-term labour was easier as that discourages the intent to settle a family in the country which is the natural result of making immigration harder (as people lack the incentive to leave and come back later), and would probably help mitigate some of the anti-immigration sentiment, but sadly it seems that is far too hot a political potato to hold.

It would also be a help if the native born residents were more willing to do menial work, so that there is not a perception of ""foreigners taking our jobs"" but that is a different debate.",0,1339486999,null,0,false,0,c4zgxm4,t3_uwqq2,t1_c4zgxm4,t1_c4z8u5g,null,1429123583,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think there's a strong argument that being dependent on welfare is bad for people's development. In fact Milton Friedman made exactly that point here

In fact his point what that welfare is morally corrosive both to the people who receive it and are infantilised by it and those who hand it out who end up with total power over their unwilling clients.

If you look at the riots in the UK the vast majority of people rioting were dependent on welfare. If you have nothing to lose, why not help yourself to a flatscreen TV when riots break out?

Now if I were in the UK and there were riots I'd stay away. That's because I fear prison, getting beaten up or losing my job.

No - you had The Party, which had inner and outer divisions within its own system.

A closer analogy would be to modern political parties which have elected MPs (inner) and their activists (outer).

A truer analogy though would be a situation where everyone in the UK is a member of the only party in existence, and your ranking within the party is reflected in the sort of job you do.

Sciences tend to be funded through agencies like the BBSRC, EPSRC, MRC, Cancer Research UK etc. You get a basic stipend of £13,000/yr tax free for most studentships. Sometimes you get more if you are partnered with a company in a CASE studentship. It's not much money for life in the UK, but its liveable because the agencies also pay your tuition for you, as well as research costs. So that £13k is all for living expenses.

However, not every subject is funded. My girlfriend did a PhD in English Literature and she is self-funded. Costs her about £8,000/yr for fees, then there's living expenses on top. Maybe another 10k/yr to live a fairly 'meh' standard of living.

Edit: forgot to mention. Some subjects you can do tutoring of undergraduate classes. Particularly sciences where you can help with their lab practicals. The going rate is usually around £12/hr.

Also, River Song giving up all of her regenerations negates this idea, as well. She's technically not even a Time Lord, and even she has a biological limit.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I think it is safe to conclude that removing the monarch would have no effect on 66% of travellers,

I wouldn't say this is set in stone - plenty of people on business will visit popular sites - I've done so myself when abroad for work.

&gt;I have at least conclusively proved that the monarch is not the driver of tourism.

Indeed - but I'm not sure anyone has ever stated that monarchy is the primary or sole reason for tourists to visit the UK. If they have, I'd agree that this is a silly statement to make.

&gt;What do we know about the tower of London? There is no residing monarch. That doesn't look good for the cause.

If the cause is to demonstrate that the royals are the only reason tourists visit; not sure who has been pushing that idea. But remember - once you go down the 'are the royals necessary?', the same can be said for beefeaters, the crown jewels...both of which (for example) part of the ToL.

&gt;and it doesn't make clear what this 500m is but it is obvious that they have included sources of revenue that would still be there if the monarchy ended at Elizabeth.

Indeed - they're lumping all the takings and attributing them to the royals - the argument for this is that the monarchy and the sites are seen as one and the same (since they're owned by the crown), which may be true but is still stretching it a bit. However, while all these sites would still draw visitors, in order to assume that their numbers would stay the same, you'd have to illustrate that the royals' popularity has no effect on the numbers visiting, say, Buckingham Palace.

&gt;Again the article is conflating 'castles and stately homes' which is history, with the ruling monarch.

No, it doesn't. You just listed a quote making two seperate statements, with different figures - not sure how that's 'conflating' when they point out that more people would visit stately homes/ castles that would visit royal-connected sites.

&gt;40% don't even care for anything royal.

But 60%, the majority, do. Now who's being convenient with figures?

&gt;And next the postcards. For me this is just absurd to use as evidence for the importance of the monarch. 

You haven't defined 'absurd' - because you're now getting convenient with justifications too. The postcard survery isn't a statement about the importance of the monarch - it's an illustration of her popularity, which is what you have to show doesn't exist in order to state that the royal-connection to these sites doesn't increase visitors. And it's just one survey - I wouldn't be at all suprised if a similar survery was done with tourists *while in London* (instead of abroad) and came back with higher pro-royal figures.

&gt;don't stock many postcards of a royal theme because 90% of tourists prefer something different.

And yet despite this 'obvious logic', pretty much every single gift shop in London stocks *dozens* of royal postcards, cardboard masks, all that kind of stuff, and have done for years. Are you suggesting that none of these sell and that they've simply been stocked for appearence's sake for decades? This is why applying your predefined opinion doesn't work - nobody has to do a survery because there are already thousands of gift shops making a tidy profit. You may as well ask if people in London like Mr. Softie ice-cream, and because nobody has bothered doing a survey conclude that nobody does.

&gt;If you insist on presenting a 10% 'approval rating' amongst card pickers, then you are doing you argument a diservice because I'll point to the same survey that shows busses are more important than the queen.

You can call it an 'approval rating' all you like - it was the third most popular choice. And the logic you've used previously would suggest that tourists don't xcare about most of the things on this list. It's also worth noting that you're prepared to ignore a 60% majority in favour of 40% when it suits your purposes - you can't have it both ways without it becoming apparent that you're forcing the statistics to fit your opinion.

&gt;If we look to a country like France that discontinued its monarchy, we find 'royal' buildings that generate more revenue and attract more visitors. Palais du Louvre would be the direct equivalent to Buckingham Palace.

France is the number one tourist destination for Europe because you can get there without needing to fly or sail. As a result, using buildings there as an example of 'more revenue' is disinegious, unless you're also suggesting that our tourists numbers would skyrocket to equal that of  France simply because we had no royals, which means we're back to proving that the royals themselves aren't a draw.

&gt;Because there is no real evidence so far

Actually, there is - you've failed to prove how it's irrelevant, or that the royals are not popular with tourists, or demonstrated how the site visitor numbers wouldn't go down without them.

&gt;I reject the claim that the monarchy cannot be abolished because it is such a driver of tourism

Based on nothing but a pre-determined opinion with no surveys of your own to back up your assertions. All you've done is illustrate what parts you're prepared to ignore, skip or misrepresent in order to cling to your belief (and without proof, that's the best word for your views at the moment).

&gt;and certainly no justification to allow a family special legal and economic privileges like not having to pay corporation tax on their business, not having to pay income tax, or not having to pay inheritance tax.

You can lay out the *other* things you don't like about the royals all you like, but it doesn't really change things here - and in any case, complaining about this sort of thing (and ignoring the tourism/ trade/ etc. revenue because it makes the argument weaker or invalid) reminds me of people moaning when we landed on the moon - do you really, seriously think that the wealth would be (for example) turned into hospitals?

&gt; If you can provide stronger evidence then I'll reconsider but until then I shall remain skeptical.

Skeptical is always good, obvious pre-existing bias is not.

&gt;The OP that asked the question did a summary of what he found out, and decided the tourism argument was thoroughly unconvincing.

The OP asked that question because (it would appear that) he got into an argument with me when I pointed out pretty much the same things I did to you, and got angry when I started asking for some evidence from his side because I wouldn't do all his research for him after providing the visitbritain link. His response was to publish that question as a new thread instead of bothering to do any himself, and tellingly, nobody in that thread posted any evidence that would help him either. In fact, I think my thread with him ended with my repeatedly asking for links (because he hadn't provided any) and him calling me a chicken and 'cowardly custard' (I'm not kidding) because I wouldn't do any research on his behalf...so he might not be such a great example for you to use :-)",0,1339493312,null,0,false,0,c4zhl3m,t3_uoyzf,t1_c4zhl3m,t1_c4z5t2o,null,1429123890,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The 3+1 idea might be appealing, less application work at least. Do you think, in that case, both the masters and phd would be in the same department/field/topic? I'm a little odd in that my research interests do not strictly fall under one area.

That is going to make you a good strong candidate for a PhD. The 3+1 as I understand it would be in the same lab, so would be a continuation of the Masters. You could always do a Masters separately and then go on to do a PhD, if the field is semi-related and uses the same or similar lab skills then it would still look good when applying for a PhD in a different area.

great point. we don't refer to 'interracial marriages' because society recognises interracial marriage as marriage. It presents no legal issues because it's still man/woman. There is no consummation issue to overcome. There is no impact upon the legal standing of non-interracial marriages when interracial marriage takes place. 

Not so with gay marriage. society in general does not use 'marriage' to refer to gay couples, that's why we constantly call it 'gay marriage'. neither does the legal world/courts and judges currently recognise 'gay marriage' as a thing. The term doesn't exist. 

&gt; Even without going into the dubious nature of that claim, if marriage is a religious institution then why do we have the concept of civil marriages and how are atheist couples allowed to marry? 

because we're talking about *legal* marriage. CofE is both a religious and legal institution, it's part of the state.

Of course we have separate words at the moment, it would be nonsensical to talk about 'allowing marriage' when marriage is clearly already allowed *for straight couples*.  (In fact, I'm pretty sure I've heard that used as a way to start debate on the concept.)  I'd bet that it *was* referred to as 'interracial marriage' when the debate there was first started, to distinguish the concept.

The use of 'interracial' to describe a marriage between two people of different race, or the use of 'civil partnership' and 'gay marriage' to refer to marriage between two people of the same gender is a deliberate tactic to set them apart, to make them different, other.  The concept of allowing gay people to have a 'civil partnership' but not a 'marriage' implies that there is a fundamental, important difference between a marriage between a straight couple and a marriage between a gay couple.  Yet I struggle to think of one.  Gay couples are *not* fundamentally different from straight couples, why should the gender of the participants have any bearing on their love and affection for each other?  Or conversely, their contempt and unhappiness in their relationship, either way.

&gt; well you're right that whatever we do should apply across the board. A straight couple need to be allowed to have a civil partnership (not a marriage) and that should include an equal definition of things like consummation; as for homosexual couples.

I don't know enough about the legal side of things to comment on the definition of consummation but it seems like a strange argument.  Clearly some appropriate details have been determined in order to allow civil partnerships so it's not exactly impossible to draw up the details.  I don't imagine that merging marriage and civil partnership is necessarily *easy*, but it seems like it should certainly be within reach and saying 'it's too difficult' sounds like a poor excuse not to have equality.",0,1339496452,null,0,false,0,c4zhv2f,t3_uxndo,t1_c4zhv2f,t1_c4zhps7,null,1429124021,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I never said the CofE *does* have a legal right to perform marriages for divorcees. It does infact allow divorcees to marry and has no organisational 'ban' on it. Marriage as a legal right is not denied to divorcees by the CofE, because they couldn't do that legally. 

&gt; The proposed law would specifically allow religious institutions to choose not to perform gay marriages.

yes, and it is therefore incoherent and so easily subject to challenge in the courts, when applied specifically to the CofE. Seperate but equal is not going to stand in UK or european courts, and the state will not be able to simultaneously recognise and deny the legal rights of gay people just because it happens in the state church and not the state registry office.

Mr Green said: ""I am hugely disappointed by the decision of HMRC not to support the CVA proposal and that disappointment will be felt acutely by Rangers fans across the world.

""Frankly, I do not see what benefit will be achieved by this decision. My consortium's offer for a CVA amounted to a total of £8.5 million.

""Now that we will have to complete the purchase via the formation of a NewCo, the purchase price and therefore the amount available to creditors will be £5.5 million.

""I can understand HMRC deciding that football clubs which do not pay their taxes need to be punished, but by effectively banning Rangers from Europe for three years all that will happen is that there will be less revenue generated by the Club and consequently less money paid over to the taxman.

""Also, I do not believe that by opting to vote against the CVA proposal, HMRC will generate more cash by pursuing those they believe as responsible - but that is a matter for them.

""I am particularly saddened by the fact that this decision will mean that small shareholders will lose their shares in The Rangers Football Club plc, something which we were trying to avoid happening.

""We will be exploring ways for the 26,000 shareholders who have lost their shares to subscribe for shares in the new company. We expect to appoint a private client broker in due course to allow existing shareholders and fans to buy into the new company.

""We will, however, examine how to address this with regard to shares in the new company.

""The solemn promise I can make to Rangers fans today is that this Club will continue as Rangers Football Club and will continue to play at Ibrox Stadium.

""We will be liaising with the football authorities at the earliest opportunity to establish our position regarding the SPL.

""I, along with my investors who believe that Rangers can have a bright future, will fight tooth and nail to ensure the Club recovers from this catastrophic phase in its proud history.

Paul Clark, joint administrator, said today: ""We have been informed by HMRC they will not support the proposal for a Company Voluntary Arrangement at the meeting of creditors on Thursday, June 14.

""As a result of this decision, the Sale and Purchase Agreement in place with the consortium led by Charles Green will take effect and Rangers Football Club will continue within a new company structure.

""The reasons HMRC have given to us for their decision to vote against the proposal are as follows. HMRC has cited its general policy of not agreeing to a CVA where there is strong evidence of non-compliance by a company with its tax liabilities.

""HMRC had agreed to consider a CVA proposal along with all other options in the case of Rangers but having taken into consideration the extent of funds which will be made available to creditors through the CVA option, they have decided that it is not acceptable given The Rangers Football Club plc's level of indebtedness to HMRC.

""It has also been made clear to us that other offers tendered for the Club, which took the form of a CVA, would have been treated in the same way and that the rejection is not a reflection of the Green consortium bid.

""HMRC has taken the view that the public interest will be better served with the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc as a corporate entity. The Club will continue to operate as it has always done but within a new company structure.

""HMRC consider that the decision will enable a liquidator to instigate a wider investigation into all of the financial affairs and management of the Club in recent years and to bring to task those they believe are responsible for its collapse.

""Furthermore, HMRC believes there will be an enhanced recovery of funds for creditors by pursuing those individuals who they believe are responsible.

""The consequence of the rejection of a CVA outcome is that sanctions will be applied to the Club by UEFA and that the Club will not be able to participate in Europe for three years and the new company will need the consent of the other SPL clubs to the transfer of the share in the SPL, in order for Rangers to continue playing in the SPL.

""As we have always stated, administrators have a primary objective to ensure the survival of the company and in this case, this would have been achieved through a CVA. It was with HMRC's approval, that a proposal was placed before creditors for consideration.

""However, it is the commercial view that the level offered within the CVA was not enough to merit departure from their normal policy of seeking a detailed investigation via a liquidator.

""However, we have been left in no doubt by HMRC the fundamental reason for the rejection of the CVA proposal is the historical non-compliance with tax liabilities by the former owners and directors of the Club.

""As we have stated previously, there is a binding contract between ourselves as administrators and Charles Green, who is leading a consortium to acquire the Club.

""The creditors' and shareholders' meetings will take place at Ibrox on Thursday but the results of those meetings will now be entirely academic given HMRC's decision.

""As soon as the CVA proposal is formally rejected, Mr Green's consortium will move towards completion of an acquisition of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club plc. That transaction will be completed within a few days.

""The sum payable to creditors will be £5.5 million, most of which has already been paid over to us by the Green consortium.

""Over the coming months, we as administrators will continue to finalise the administration of the Club and we will work in conjunction with BDO who will undertake the liquidation process.

""We would like to thank the staff and supporters at Rangers for their great determination and professionalism during a very difficult period for the Club. While the Club will continue to face difficulties in the short term, it will survive and continue to play at Ibrox.""

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; The use of 'interracial' to describe a marriage between two people of different race, or the use of 'civil partnership' and 'gay marriage' to refer to marriage between two people of the same gender is a deliberate tactic to set them apart, to make them different, other. 

The terms 'civil partnership' and 'gay marriage' are different, legally. The term marriage has a legal definition. It does not currently include the possibility or concept of male/male or female/female union. This isn't homophobes trying to be divisive, it's the way it currently is. 

&gt; Gay couples are not fundamentally different from straight couples

I'm afraid practically they are. How does a gay couple consumate a marriage? How do they procreate? These are fundamental differences. They have legal implications. 

I have to admit I don't see where the gay couple currently does not have equality. The only ways they don't have equality is;

The vast majority of bishops ive met, and I meet a lot in my line of work, have no problem with gay people, the ""gay lifestyle"" or gay partnerships. But that doesnt mean they should have to perform gay marriage ceremonies in a church. 

I realise that the church is a state thing as well as a religious thing in this country. But if a religion says that marriage is a union solely between man and woman, which it does, then to a C of E vicar, theres no question as to whether gay people can be C of E married. Its not a ""gay people shouldn't be allowed"" thing, its a ""gay people simply cant"". Like calling a dog a cat, or saying 1+1=3. Marriage as defined by the C of E, as a heterosexual thing.

What needs to happen is a redefining on the state side of marriage/civil partnership. Or even better, a reupheaval of the marriage concept in the church, so yes you have marriage, but you also have something just as religiously and legally binding, for gay couples. 

How that affects the church I dont know, but essentially this argument isnt over gay prejudice, its about semantics and word use.

EDIT: Spelling and grammar

EDIT: I'll say this now, please dont use this as an excuse to go on about Christians hating gays, and how religion should die, and how ""hurr durr God created gays so what does that prove, got you their bible basher""
Its that sort of attitude that is derailing the entire debate, By and large Church of England clergy are not prejudiced. I mean come on, this is the ""Cake or Death"" religion, its not exactly Westboro Baptist Church although im sure some people wish it was so they could hate it more. This debate IS NOT about homophobia, its about how we use language and how that affects the variety of laws in this country.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"I think it's important to put this into context. They're talking about it as a threat to the CoE, which it is, not as a threat the UK or British way of life, which it isn't (aside from CoE people).

The CoE is actually much bigger than we normally think, with branches throughout the commonwealth. A lot of CoE folk went to Africa and various islands in the empire to 'tame the savages' so to speak (not that the people there were savage or needed taming, mind).

Because views on homosexuality differ in some of these countries and there's CoE scripture that actually says homosexuality is a sin, this is a real threat to the integrity of the CoE worldwide. On the one hand you have the UK and Canada where rational people would support gay marriage, but on the other hand in places like Uganda, where anti-homosexual propoganda is in the news and on tv all the time, it's politically impossible for the CoE to take a pro-gay marriage position (please note I'm not singling out Uganda as the only anti-gay country, it's just the first one that came to mind).

If you don't like the CoE, then this is a good time to live in, as what will probably happen if gay marriage goes through with CoE blessing is a schism on the scale of the Latin/Orthodox schism between the Byzantines and Romans. If you do like CoE it's a terrible time to live in as you'd much rather avoid the question and keep this marriage stuff out of the limelight, like a small boy being abused by a vicar.

They can and they did. The CofE has allowed marriage of divorcees only since 2002. These rules are internal and though approved by Parliament are not derived from statute - the laws governing marriage in England and Wales are the [Marriage Act 1836](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836), the [Marriage Act 1949](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1949) and the [Marriage Act 1994](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1994). The latter introduced changes only to approved venues of civil weddings so the relevant legislation is the two earlier acts, neither of which grant the absolute right for everyone to marry in a CofE ceremony without discrimination.

&gt;Seperate but equal is not going to stand in UK or european courts

It will. It already does, in fact. The CofE, like all religious institutions, is exempted from discrimination rules for things like employment. These have never been successfully challenged in Britain or the ECHR

&gt;Why does it make you fear so?

It does?

Yes.

&gt;Don't feel bad.

I feel bad?

&gt;I asked an entire subreddit and they couldn't find anything either. 

Actually, they did. You failed to find anything to the contrary.

&gt;You're right I didn't really destroy your arguments because there was nothing there to destroy.

And yet you still couldn't find any evidence outside of your opinion.

&gt;Destroy is what godzilla does. I just blew gently and the house of cards collapsed.

Where did you do this?

&gt;It was that easy. 

As in 'you gave up'.

Again, you have failed to prove otherwise.

Yes, let's use copy and paste instead of addressing the dead-ends you created for yourself.

&gt;You lied, you got caught.

Quote my first reply when you pointed out I'd made a mistake.

Quote where I did this.

&gt;I blew it down.

Quote where I did this.

&gt;You tried to ignore my link. 

Quote where I did this.

&gt;You can't find any other links of your own.

Yeah, my posts really make that obvious. Shall we count how many statements I've addresses of yours, and vice-versa? Oh look, you lose. Including repeating false statements in this (and the last) post when you've been hoisted by your own petard.

&gt;You're getting upset that I'm calling you cowardly custard

Actually, I've encouraged it - it's a good demonstration of your ultimate course of action when you've talked yourself into a dead end.

&gt;but you're proving it every time you waffle 

Waffle that you can't answer. So, in short, it only takes waffle to confuse you. 

&gt;and chicken out of answering my very simple question.

Let's count the avoidance tactics. Again.

On the second point, they are concerned that, without disestablishment of church and state, they will be *forced* to marry gay couples in their churches, under human rights law.

true, but I'm talking about the situation *now*. These laws show there had to be a redefining, and a change in the position of the church, to make it possible. Hence the church is still the established church. 

On the issue of gay marriage this will have to happen again, except this time the church won't compromise. so they will either be forced to marry gays, or disestablish. (not really just the church's decision, and not a tiny issue). 

&gt; It will. It already does, in fact. The CofE, like all religious institutions, is exempted from discrimination rules for things like employment. These have never been successfully challenged in Britain or the ECHR

can you give me an example of this? for example, how would discrimination rules in employment compare to this gay marriage issue?

&gt; They are not public bodies as such.

I understand that. But they are part of the state. Anyone can get married in the CofE if they want to, can afford it, and jump through the hoops.

False.

&gt;Answering my question.

False.

Addressed.

&gt;Answering my simple question.

You've already said this. Try to remember what you're typing.

&gt;Providing a 500 word summary to back up the claim.

Links, please.

&gt;Give me a summary of the arguments supplied by everyone else on this thread.

Why?

&gt; If the claim is true there should be lots more evidence to please sum it up quickly for me.

Do your own googling. Not everyone is your teacher.

&gt;It shouldn't take you nearly as long as it takes you to do your ""quote and distract"" diatribes that are barely worth the time it takes to skim them. 

If you made assertions that actually had any basis in reality outside your head, the replies might be worth reading. I guess that's what happens when you throw a lot of abuse or blatantly untrue accusations and then pretend you couldn't be bothered to read the replies rather than defend your guff (or, y'know, actually provide any links of your own). You even complain that the responder isn't doing your work for you.

&gt;You've got nothing.

You must be entering minus-nothing, then.

&gt;I've proved that 40% of people who plan to visit the UK have no interest at all in seeing anything royal. 

Which means 60% do. Justify this.

&gt;I've also proved that Royal attractions are dwarved by non royal ones (and most royal attractions aren't royal at all) 

Once again, what does this actually mean? What relevance does it have?

&gt;and I've proved your a coward. 

No, you haven't. Your definition of 'proof' seems to change as it suits you - in two years, I've never met anyone that asserts that adding their opinion to their own post counts as such. Or maybe it's more a case of never meeting anyone stupid enough to do that. And then brag about it.

&gt;I've done all of that 

'All of that' being procrastination and not much else.

&gt;and I don't even have the burden of proof on my shoulders

Yes, you do. This has been the case since you were asked for a relevant link.

&gt;And you who carry that burden have proved... well nothing really. 

And yet you've used the same link for your own evidence. Odd how it's legitimate when it's useful to you, but 'proves nothing' when it isn't.

&gt;Only some meaningless waffle about a postcard. 

3rd most popular choice. 60% visiting have an interest in the royals. Demonstrate how this does not mean tourist $. Unless you're now asserting 'meaningless' to mean 'facts'.

&gt;Accept one of my challenges. Go on just one.

Still procrastinating.

&gt;Prove you're not the coward I've proved you are. 

Odd that you love that word considering you're frightened of providing any relevant links.

&gt;Can't do it can you?

Done it. It's your turn.

&gt;Cowardly custard.

Very much this.  

Indeed, according to the Office for National Statistics, [civil marriages made up the majority (68%) of marriages in England and Wales in 2010](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/marriages-in-england-and-wales--provisional-/2010/marriages-in-england-and-wales--2010.html).  I'd argue that in many ways the church has already lost their influence over the institution of marriage.  I think we can take it as read that the overwhelming majority of Christians will have a religious ceremony and they still don't number 50%.  I'd also wager there are a decent number of non-religious people having religious ceremonies for the tradition of using a church, but that's more difficult to pin statistics to.",0,1339504861,null,0,false,0,c4ziqvc,t3_uxndo,t1_c4ziqvc,t1_c4zibfa,null,1429124604,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's pretty unlikely that a gay couple would stay in a non-gay friendly church or for a gay couple to explicitly join a church and get on the electoral register just to be eligible for marriage by a non-gay friendly priest but it is not impossible. If individual priests or parishes had an opt out clause not to marry a couple because of their sexuality it would be legalized discrimination which would be bad for their image. If the whole COE opted out on orders from above that would put the gay-friendly priests in a dilemma.

If the COE Bishops voted outright to support gay marriage then the African and some Asian provinces would leave the Anglican Communion which in turn would lead the way for bigger splits inside provinces where individual parishes and episcopates may follow a more ""traditional"" branch.

Hopefully we will end up with something approaching separation; religious marriage for the religious (with whatever restrictions they impose) and civil marriage for everyone else.

No, you fucking idiot. The Anglican church decided to change its own rules. It was voted on by the General Synod and passed by Parliament. IT WAS NOT DERIVED FROM STATUTE PASSED PREVIOUSLY AND INDEPENDENTLY BY PARLIAMENT.

&gt;can you give me an example of this? for example, how would discrimination rules in employment compare to this gay marriage issue?

Firstly, [for the purposes of legislation in the UK, the CofE is not considered a pure public authority](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200304/jtselect/jtrights/39/39.pdf), so just fucking shut up about it being a ""state church"". Individual parishes have been ruled to be specifically NOT public authorities so individual parishes do not hold [public sector equality duty](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/149) as set out in the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents). This means that it would not be unlawful or illegal for any or all CofE parishes to refuse to perform gay marriage if the law was changed.

The Equality Act 2010 makes a number of exemptions for religious organisations. [Schedule 9 Part 1 Section 2](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/schedule/9/part/1/crossheading/religious-requirements-relating-to-sex-marriage-etc-sexual-orientation) allows religious organisations to discriminate in the areas of employment and appointment of office-holders on the grounds of gender, gender reassignment, marital status, being married to a divorcee, being divorced, and sexual orientation.

[Schedule 9 Part 1 Section 3](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/schedule/9/part/1/crossheading/other-requirements-relating-to-religion-or-belief) allows religious organisations to employ only people of that religion in certain occupations.

And under [Section 202, part 4](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/202) it explicitly states:

&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Act places an obligation on religious organisations to host civil partnerships if they do not wish to do so.

Or you could, you know, be a parent and stop trying to get others to do it for you. There is plenty of software out there to help filter home connections - use it.


&gt;Internet service providers could solve the problem by blocking pornography at network level whilst giving adults a choice to 'opt-in' to this content.


Or you could block it on your network. If your kid is looking for violent media, they will find it anyway (TV is a good start). If they want to read about some really horrendous acts though, they need look no further than the bible.

Their ""Facts"" page is backed up by referencing people of faith. For example, Mary Anne Layden.

Dr. Mary Anne Layden - At first she appears to be a Catholic who wants to push the view of the church. The views of the Catholic church are well known in this area.

Putting that to one side though, she does seem to have a book behind her: ""The Social Costs of Pornography: A Statement of Findings and Recommendations"". Mixed reviews on Amazon, but not really a good indicator. Looking into the history of the book, you come across [This](http://www.socialcostsofpornography.com/faqs.pdf), which explains it grew out of a conference from the Witherspoon Institute. Fair enough....but the Witherspoon Institute for those that don't know is a conservative 'Think Tank' that are pro hetrosexal / anti-gay, anti-porn and anti-everything you'd expect with an American ""conservative"" group.

It's hardly an unbiased source.

Even the ""Get involved"" bit suggests if you want to help, you should ""Pray"".

In short, it's your standard religious organisation that wants to push censorship at a service level because they disagree with it, as opposed to actually helping parents be parents.

nice.

&gt; The Anglican church decided to change its own rules. It was voted on by the General Synod and passed by Parliament. IT WAS NOT DERIVED FROM STATUTE PASSED PREVIOUSLY AND INDEPENDENTLY BY PARLIAMENT.

I never said otherwise, and you are letting your rage cloud your comprehension. I said the church **changed it's position**. There is going to be no such change on the gay marriage issue, at least nowhere on the horizon according to this latest statement. 

and I never said the church was a ""pure public authority"" so calm down and dismantle your straw men. That is not the topic of debate. 

&gt; This means that it would not be unlawful or illegal for any or all CofE parishes to refuse to perform gay marriage if the law was changed.

according to what? there exists no law yet on such a subject. Laws are challenged once they come into force, and this one will be. No clause can overrule the plain reading of human rights and anti-discriminatory behaviour. 

Yes the church has some exemptions; the point is the church as an organisation doesn't say divorced marriage is wrong. To make gay marriage possible in CofE churches will require the church to compromise it's position; otherwise the law means nothing and gays would not be equal. If anyone who jumps through certain hoops can get married in the CofE, and gay marriage is legal, then the church will not be able to discriminate. It will be sued, challenged, etc. 

You are placing all your trust in the govt. proposals and their statement; ""there will be no obligation"". That is very different from ""there will be no reasonable coherent legal challenge"". The govt. doesn't control judges and justice and it does not make court judgements. It certainly doesn't control the humans rights courts.

I've shown you in the Equality Act exactly where the exemptions are that will not force religious organisations to perform same-sex marriages, including the precedent of an explicitly worded amendment that clearly states there is no obligation for religious organisations to perform civil partnerships. I've shown that the Anglican Church as the established church has no extra duties as a public authority under the Equality Act or the Human Rights Act. Now you're pulling imaginary future legal challenges out of your arse.

Firstly, the provision of religious exemptions in the Equality Act has never been successfully challenged in the British Supreme Court. The ECHR, which only offers advisory opinions and not binding rulings, has never ruled the provision of religious exemptions in such legislation to be unlawful. See, for example, [Siebenhaar v. Germany](http://sim.law.uu.nl/sim/caselaw/Hof.nsf/1d4d0dd240bfee7ec12568490035df05/a82615ce1d902eccc125782900406c3d?OpenDocument).

What exactly are you worried about? You're going on about the legal status of the Church of England and equalities and human rights legislation but you obviously have no fucking clue what you're going on about. 

I compared you a few posts back to Pontius Pilate. When Jesus was brought before him, Pilate used legalities to to wash his hands of the issue. That's what your arguments remind me of. You can't bring yourself to admit that you are actually opposed to marriage equality on a bigoted principle, so you're hiding behind legislation.

Your argument here isn't sound. The burden of proof is always with the claimant, he who is insisting on some truth. It is unfair for that person to turn around and say 'I am correct until you prove me wrong'. I don't know how much philosophy you will have come across during your education, but one of the first issues of that discipline is learning the rules of debate. One fundamental rule is the burden of proof. A court cannot assert guilt based on the fact that [the defendant could not prove he wasn't there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_burden). The prosecution has the burden of proof, always, and in this argument you are the prosecution's equivalent because you are supporting the truth claim: the ruling monarch is a significant draw of tourism. The evidence you present is terribly weak and a single advertisement on a non-scientific website, who's role as a fluffer of tourism conflicts with saying anything bad about the monarchy.

You are obliged to provide more evidence, presumably you have more evidence otherwise you are guilty of committing the sin of pushing a 'predefined opinion'. A sin you keep throwing at others. If one link lacking context and detail, that talks about a survey yet denies you access to the full results, is enough evidence for certainty then it smacks of at least laziness. People have said your evidence is weak, and your response is to duck out telling others it is up to them to prove you wrong.

Anyone can challenge any law if they like. The fact that someone has challenged a law and lost does not set a precedent for future challenges to be won. I can't believe I actually had to type that out but I'm obviously dealing with a moron.

You keep saying things like:

&gt;The CofE will be in the unique position of being an established church and yet not recognising state law regarding marriage. It will be at odds with the law of the land, discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, unless it changes it's position. It is not difficult to see how that will not take long to fall apart.

Yet you haven't actually cited any laws which show that that is the case. 

I've demonstrated why it's not the case. I've shown a ruling from the House of Lords, I've shown UK legislation and rulings from the ECHR. The Equalities Act explicitly exempts the CofE, as a religious institution, from certain provisions, for fuck's sake. It is, in your words, ""at odds with the law of the land"", except it isn't because the exemptions are written into statute. Just as exemptions regarding same-sex marriage could be!

The fundamental issue is that the UK govt. cannot future proof this issue with a little 'exception'. You may believe the government, I don't. It wouldn't be the first time the govt. lied or misled the people about a piece of legislation and it's future impact. You must be a hardcore Tory. 

The ECtHR [said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9157029/Gay-marriage-is-not-a-human-right-according-to-European-ruling.html) ""Where national legislation recognises registered partnerships between same sex, member states should aim to ensure that their legal status and their rights and obligations are equivalent to those of heterosexual couples in a similar situation."" [more on that here](http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ecthr-churches-will-be-forced-to.html). 

You are drinking the kool-aid if you think the ECtHR can have no impact on any legislation we pass. They supersede it. They can overrule it. unless you are also a UKIP supporter and want out of europe/the human rights law.

Im going to lay it out in straight logical facts

Marriage (the word) is by definition and is in pretty much every religion, a union between man and woman. 

The C of E supports this definition, marriage, is something ONLY heterosexual people can be a part of, not out of prejudice, but because thats the definition, a union between male and female.

When the Guardian says ""Church of England says gay unions will destroy marriage"" what they mean is that the word itself will not mean the same thing.

Added points to this are that the media will use the words Church of England, to refer to any vicar who says something, it doesn't mean the entire structure of the C of E endorses the message of whoevers soundbite it was

Also, why is the focus so heavily on the word marriage, why does it matter so fucking much, that we can say ""oh im married"" Thats not the churches problem, thats societies problem for associating the only legally binding agreement between two individuals with marriage, its not.

The truth is you'll find a lot of vicars who'd be quite happy to provide a unifying ceremony for same sex couples if one was drawn up, but just have a problem with calling it marriage, not out of prejudice, but because logically they cant.

Davies, I think, utilized his staff much better. He was also better about weaving a story with threads he didn't even know he was writing until he picked them back up. I think that's his greatest strength.

For instance, when Donna Noble came back for season 4, it felt as if she never actually left. We saw her once, and then heard absolutely nothing about her, but Davies was able to pick her back up and work her into the Doctor's adventure like she was always supposed to be part of it.

Moffat, on the other hand, had a really spectacular idea with River Song, but the follow through was just... I don't even want to call it bad. It was just mediocre, I guess. I think if Moffat focused on River entirely, creating a non-linear series that just tells the stories of River and the Doctor's encounters, even the small, quiet ones where they really are just on dates to amazing places, I think that could have been wonderful.

true,fundingoptions,null,null,"Hi, I handle the tech side of things for OP so I'll try to give a little guidance:

The number one thing you should be doing to learn about coding is... coding. Find whatever personal itch you want to scratch, find an open source project that partly meets the needs and modify it to suit your requirements. For a lot of people (myself included back in the day), this will be a CMS of some sort and this is fine. As you get comfortable with the basics, you'll be able to move on to more advanced types of programming.

If you are working, look for opportunities to apply the skills you have learnt to your workplace. Perhaps they could do with an intranet set up using a CMS, or you could write a simple process to automate something that is currently done manually. Remember, if you can read the code and you can Google you can eventually get something working - the rest is just time.

To help you along with the above, try taking courses and tutorials that will teach you the area of programming you are interested in. For example, [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012) or [CodeAcademy] (http://www.codecademy.com/).

Hope this helps!

TLDR: Practice, take courses, practice some more

A House of Lords decision in 2011 declared that was incorrect, and clergy could be classed as employees and could therefore benefit from the same employment protections the rest of us are entitled to (such as anti discrimination legislation and the right not to be unfairl dismissed etc).  

Not satisfied with having to treat their staff in the basic way set down by society under the law, the COE has developed a new set of terms and conditions, and their staff now work under ""Common Tenure"" which is a fancy way of saying ""don't be so stupid, of course you're not an employee and we can treat you however we want"".  

The proposed new gay marriage law really doesn't have anything to do with the COE though.  The legislation will only apply to civil marriage, and so there wouldn't be any legal authority for the Church to carry out same sex marriages even if they wanted to.

It's 170 miles of itself but it means you get to take in Lancaster and York too with a definitive start-finish.  Apparently there's only 1.5 miles off road where it's a broken path and about 15 miles broken up over the journey where it's a main road.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;If gay marriage became legal, the CofE would inevitably be charged with illegal discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

I heard a similar statement on the radio earlier today. Someone representing the CofE said that legalizing gay marriage would lead to themselves being taken to the European Court of Human Rights if they refused to marry a gay couple. 

I was dumbfounded. Think about what the guy was saying. The guy, and I assume many who agreed with him, had the audacity to think that  because legalizing gay marriage would unveil the danger of the church being taken to the European Court of Human Rights for refusing to marry gays, then legalizing gay marriage is not an option.  What? So now we can't have gay marriage because we don't want the church to have a scuffle with the European Court of Human Rights? It annoys me because there is an implicit judgement by the church in taking that viewpoint, an implicit judgement that their right to choose what kind of couples they marry takes precedence over whether gays can marry. It's just bigoted. These people are so bigoted that they probably don't even realize when they are showing it.

The European Court of *Human Rights*. The Church of England need to realize that when it comes to marriage, they are no more than a vehicle, delivering the service. If they, the church itself, openly admits that the Court of Human Rights doesn't think it can do a good job of deciding what to do with their marriage service, then does that not tell you that something is wrong with the church, rather than something is wrong with the gay marriage legislation that lead to the problem?

his signings are more then to be desired, Andrea Dossena £7 million, Fernando Morientes £7 million, and Robbie Keane $19 million (before you say torres he wasnt a revelation he was known before he came to the prem) he tried to organise a swap deal for xabi alonso for gareth barry, which is one of the reasons he left.

It's not something a lot of artists can do and it shows that you genuinely want to improve and become a better artist, a very positive trait to have. So without further ado, let's analyze.

To look closer to the jacket on the left the most glaring mistake is how the suit's right arm (our left) is quite massive compared to the sleeve on the suit's left (our right). In fact one might think that there *is* no right arm to this suit as a massive bulge from the outercoat blocks one's view. This stands in stark contrast with the admittedly thin left arm the suit has.

Moving onto the second it's clear you went for a more dynamic pose and clearly became confused. The jacket's collar and flares are *far* too small compared to the rest of the suit. The body fills up spaces that it shouldn't, creating and awkward bulge.
The arms appear badly bent and the hands appear far too large.
The waist (and pockets) are not in alignment with the back here.

I know that all seems overwhelming, but all of these problems is actually one problem.

You need to have a figure for proportions. A model to look at certainly helps in most cases, but before you draw a suit, draw a person and get a nice clear frame started before you do anything (this frame is merely for reference and can be erased later.

During his time with Valencia he won the league twise and the UEFA-Cup.

Besides from winning the CL and getting them to a second final he also won the FA-Cup and finished 2nd in the league 08-09. Thanks to Benitez Gerrard is still playing for Liverpool. He signed Torres, Xabi Alonso, Mascherano, Luis Garcia, Lucas. Sure he also made some shit signings but honestly what manager doesn't?

Inter had a stronger squad than AC Milan? No chance in hell. Mourinho got the best out of those players that were for the most part way passed their prime.

And the fact that both Liverpool and Inter have been axing managers faster than anyone can keep up with kind of proves that the problem wasn't the managers but something else. Have Liverpool or Inter turned around since they fired Benitez? No, Liverpool are even worse and Inter is basicly in the same state. And hmm... Let's see... Isn't the guy who got fired right after Benitez currently managing the England national team? Oh yeah he is!

It wasn't a straight swap deal for Barry. He and the board wanted to cash in on Alonso to be able to sign more players, Barry being one of them. And are you going to claim that Barry isn't a great player? He've been great at City, you know that team that won the league this year.

For forgiveness? I would have thought the best place to go would be to the victims. Of course if God is the one that has been 'wronged' that is a different matter altogether. Saying a few extra prayers seems to easy a method of cleaning one's conscience. Have you ever wondered why the church created confession? The centralisation of all the community's misdeeds doesn't sit well with me. A system like that seems wide open to abuse. I remember going to confession as a boy, I actually made stuff up because I never did anything that warranted a special private meeting with the priest. Looking back though, it seems really corrosive as the parent 'gives away' their child to the church.

That leaves routine, tradition, and comfort. There's a danger of dishonesty here, you aren't in it for the right reasons but for some self interest. I don't want to demean your faith as if it is a security blanket, but it would seem more noble and a sign of strength to live without the scaffolding. If you want community there are far more accepting ones out there that don't have the history and continuation of abuse. Taking part in Christianity might make you feel good, but as an ideology it is corrupting the school system, affecting politics, interfering with a woman's right to family planning in all manner of ways, and consider the homosexuals or those born neither male nor female.

&gt; First off, how does it all work? Do all the clubs just tally their points from all the regular season matches and determine the winner that way?

Basically, each top-level English club will participate in 3 domestic competitions in the season - the league, and 2 cup competitions. 

For the league, it's pretty much how you described it - Liverpool will play every other team in their league (the Premier League, which is the highest league of English football), at home and away from home. 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss. Tally them up, the team with the most points at the end of the season wins.

The cup competitions are basic knockout competitions.

&gt; Why do clubs from one country sometimes play a club from another country?

Above, I said there were 3 *domestic* competitions. There are also two *European* competitions, which is where clubs from different countries will play each other. The two competitions are the Champions League and the Europa League, with the Champions League being more prestigious and lucrative.

*Generally speaking*, the teams that come 1st-4th in the league qualify for next season's Champions League, the team that comes 5th qualifies for the Europa League, as do the teams that win the cup competitions.

&gt; Secondly, how is Liverpool's team doing? 

It's been a rough couple of years for us. Financial issues off the pitch (our previous American owners leveraged their debt on the club, crippling our ability to buy and hold on to quality players) saw us slip from a title-challenging team (2nd in the league, 2008-9) to a team struggling for the top 4 (our past 3 seasons have finished 7th, 6th, and 8th in the league).

In the league, this past season has been very frustrating, with injuries/suspensions to key players, Liverpool dominating games but being unable to score goals (we hit the posts a record 30 times this season, and at other times our shooting was just shit), and expensive new signings not delivering value for money. 

The cups were fantastic, though - we won one of them, the Carling Cup, (our first trophy since 2006) while we reached the final of the other, which we disappointingly lost 2-1; nonetheless, two cup finals in a season is a rare feat.

In the league, our team was challenging for the top 4, to return to the Champions League, but our 8th-placed finish led to our new owners sacking the manager, [Kenny Dalglish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Dalglish), despite him being the most famous player in Liverpool's history, and reaching two cup finals.",0,1339541566,null,0,1339541968,0,c4zrq1r,t3_uyqjh,t1_c4zrq1r,t3_uyqjh,null,1429128856,23,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,23

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"Good reply, 5uare2. Basically sums up the answers I would have given.

Just wanted to add.

&gt; Thirdly, how do players switch teams? How do 'transfers' work?

Transfers are usually done in form of cash payment to the club the player is contracted to. For a hypothetical example, let's say Liverpool are interested in a player from the Italian club Chievo (transfers are not limited to nations), so they offer Chievo 20 million Euros for the player. Chievo accept Liverpool's terms and the player is now allowed to negotiate a contract with Liverpool. This obviously differs from American sports, where when players are traded, they still must honour the existing contract. 

So the player and his agent meet with Liverpool to negotiate a contract. Once the player and LFC agree to terms, he can join the team, *provided it is within the transfer window*. Similar to ""trade deadlines"" in American sports, there are only certain windows that players can move teams. In England (and *most* of Europe) there are two windows a year. One between June and the end of August (beginning of the season) and one at the midway point of the season, from 1-31 January.

&gt; How do teams find players to pursue?

Scouting. While scouting was once a black art, it's become much easier due to the increase in Television. All major clubs, as a courtesy, will send video of any matches that another team requests, and vice versa. Still, a keen scout that can find deals or unknown players is a valuable commodity (read about Newcastle last season).

&gt;  Is there a draft?

Nope, and really there is nothing even close to it. Young talent is typically developed through a team's academy. Young players are identified at a very young age (sometimes as young as 8 or 9, but usually in the early teen years) and will be offered a spot in a team's academy. This is essentially a private school system for young men who train at football skills when they are not studying. Once the players reach 17 years old, the club must offer them a professional contract or they are free to join another team. Liverpool once had an unbelievable academy and many of our top talents were ""home grown"", but our academy products have dropped in recent years. Currently, the captain Steven Gerrard is the only really great player to come out of the LFC academy in the last 15 years, but there are several highly rated prospects, including Martin Kelly, who is representing England at the EURO tournament. There is no collegiate system for competitive football in Europe, so very few players have ever attended a university (less than 1%). 

As an aside, this is a big reason why America will struggle to ever be competitive with the rest of the footballing world. Few parents will forgo a chance for their child to get a college education to join an academy where they will only have a 2% chance of ever becoming a professional footballer.

I was born and raised in Liverpool and have followed the club my entire life. We have been very frustrating in recent years and are likely entering a transistion period over the next few seasons. That being said, we have one of the strongest fan bases in the world and some of the most dedicated fans.

If you ever have any question, no matter how stupid it may seem, don't be afraid to ask (when I lived in the states I got very in to American football and asked a ton of dumb questions).

true,hireddithowareyou,lfcflame,,"In my opinion, your best bet to become as big of a fanatic as you are with other sports is to immerse yourself in as much reliable info as you can.  This subreddit is great, I've found it amazing in helping to sift through the trash in the footballing media to find the real stories worth reading about.  The sidebar is a great way to keep up with the games.  The next game is up top, the recent results, fixtures, league position and scoring stats are there, and then the good stuff - the info.

The [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) page is actually a pretty good way to get a bit of an overview.  Watch ALL of the videos on the sidebar - the highlights, the goal compilations, and the other videos. If [The Miracle of Istanbul](http://thekop.liverpoolfc.tv/_Liverpool-vs-AC-Milan-Champions-League-Final-2005/video/1604541/173471.html?b=) isn't ingrained in your memory by the time you're done (since I assume that is probably the greatest game you are old enough to know of in our history), you have more work to do.

My favourite news source for all that is Liverpool is [The Tomkins Times](http://tomkinstimes.com/).  Another good source is [oh you beauty](http://ohyoubeauty.blogspot.com/) and a good podcast and news source is [The Anfield Wrap](http://www.theanfieldwrap.com/).  For football in general, check out [The Football Ramble](http://thefootballramble.com/) site and podcast.  For football economics, if that's your thing, nothing can beat [The Swiss Ramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.com/).  Also, learn about and respect the 96 who lost their lives at [Hillsborough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) and never EVER buy the S*n, link to it, or speak its vile name for the disgusting way in which they lied, slandered, and spit on the names of those who were in attendance that day.

Go through all of that, keep up with this subreddit regularly, and you're on your way. Liverpool fans are known the world over for being the most football-educated fans in the world, the atmosphere at Anfield is absolutely legendary (one of the reasons why FSG, our owners who also own the Red Sox, would rather redevelop Anfield than build a new stadium), and our future is bright - don't listen to the naysayers that are out there.  Never give up on the lads, recognize good football when you see it (Swansea's beautiful footballing display got a standing ovation after a 0-0 draw at Anfield long before anyone had any idea Rodgers would be our new gaffer), and always remember to be a proud Red.

If you have any other questions, just ask within the threads that people post when a question pops up.  We're all together here, so everyone is willing to give a fellow Red a hand, but to be honest, we are far too big of a club in terms of history and prestige to ever be able to learn enough to even build a foundation as a fan in a single post like this.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"&gt; Who are our key players?

[Steven Gerrard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard), our captain fantastic. Captain of the team, a local Liverpool player (raised through our academy rather than transferred in), and now the captain of the England national team as well. He's an attacking central midfielder, but is capable of playing many roles/positions. Unfortunately he's 32 now, and has had injury problems over the last two seasons. When fit, still a key player.

[Luis Suarez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su%C3%A1rez_(Uruguayan_footballer)), star striker. Unpredictable, scores spectacular goals, creates chances for others - but is also guilty of missing easy chances. He's a bit of a bastard, too, but he's our bastard, so it's OK!

[Lucas Leiva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Leiva), defensive midfielder who does the dirty work and lays a platform for others to attack. He was much criticized when he first joined the club at age 21, but has made great strides and is a key man for us - a season-ending injury to him in December, without anyone in the squad who played his role, caused our league campaign to collapse.

[Pepe Reina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Reina) is one of the best goalkeepers in the league, while [Daniel Agger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Agger) and [Martin Skrtel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Skrtel) are our main defensive pairing, again one of the league's best. Unfortunately, Agger is another injury-prone player, while Skrtel is being linked with a move to a club that offers Champions League football - hopefully this isn't true!

&gt; What kind of system does the coach run? Who is the coach?

The new coach brought in is [Brendan Rodgers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers), a young and relatively inexperienced coach, but looks like he has a lot of potential. This past season he was manager of Swansea, a team newly promoted to the Premier League and as such expected to finish in the bottom 3 and get relegated back to the second division. Instead, they came 11th, all while playing an attractive possession and passing based football, with a team of relative unknowns on the lowest wage bill in the league.

As for his system, there's lots of articles out there, but [this one](http://thepathismadebywalking.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/682/) summarises it best. He plays like Spain and Barcelona, the most successful national and club teams of the last 4-5 years - focusing on short passing and retaining possession to dominate the opposition. We're hoping he can implement this style for Liverpool, and that with better players than at Swansea, achieve even more.

&gt; What are the team's strengths and weaknesses?

Strengths: Our defence was one of the best in the league, despite Lucas' injury; we conceded the 3rd fewest goals in the league. Also, despite our team underperforming, we do have quality players in attack, namely Gerrard and Suarez.

Weaknesses: Scoring goals. We created a lot of chances this season, but couldn't put them away, at times unlucky (several goalkeepers put in season-best performances against us), and at other times just awful shooting from us.

Still, our strengths and weaknesses both might change under Rodgers, so we'll have to wait and see.",0,1339542718,null,0,false,0,c4zrzqg,t3_uyqjh,t1_c4zrzqg,t1_c4zrq1r,null,1429128981,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

&gt;Do all the clubs just tally their points from all the regular season matches and determine the winner that way? 



Yes.


&gt;Why do clubs from one country sometimes play a club from another country? 



Many reasons one could be an international friendly. Which is when one club plays another just for practice. Liverpool will be playing Roma(an italian side) and Toronto FC(from Canada's hat) this july.


Another is because of the champions League which happens every year, The top four in England get to go this tournement. It all depends on. The amount from each country is dependant on how strong the clubs in that country is. So if all the clubs in England became shit. England could only have 1 or 2 in the champions league. Another reason that Clubs play another country is the Europa league( This is what Liverpool is in). This goes to the fifth place team, cup winners(FA and Carling Cup).


&gt;Secondly, how is Liverpool's team doing?

 We have a good team, and we arguably had a bad manager tactics wise. Which brought us down, but the big thing is that we have a bunch of players under performing. Stewart Downing, Andy Carroll( Though he picked up towards the end of the season), Henderson(but i love him), and Adam( he dropped form when he had to change position because one of our key players(Lucas) got injured. Yeah, I just answered the recently, but I'll explain past 10 ish years. We had a coach called Benitez. He got us to the final of the Champions League( This is a big fucking deal), and won us it once(This is super big fucking deal), but after a few bad decisions, and change in owners he got fired, and then we got a manager named Roy Hodgson( Current England manager) he played pretty bad tactics and got sacked by December. Then Dalglish came played great football for the rest of season, but in his second season he bought a lot of players that underperformed and we came 8 in the league, and he got fired. Now we had Brenden Rodgers(former Swansea manager). He played great football there and got a newly promoted team 13th ( if you don't know that be bitching).


&gt;Who are the key players?

Steven Gerrard(the captain/center mid), Luis Suarez(Striker), Lucas Leiva, Danial Agger(center back), Skrtle(Center back) are all are great key players. Youngsters that are big are Flannagan(right back), Kelly(Center back/right back), Robinson(left back), Sterling(left mid), Morgan(center mid), Suso(**can't remember, but making bold so someone else comments the answer**)

&gt;Who is the coach?

Brendan Rodgers. 


&gt;What kind of system does the coach run? 


He's brand new. He came after our season ended. So none of us know what he's going to play in liverpool, but in his former club Swansea he played a 4-3-3 or 3-4-3 formation. The 3-4-3 involves wing backs running up the flanks. the 4-3-3 is a big proponent of Tika tika.

&gt;What are the team's strengths and weaknesses?


Strengths- Defense


Weaknesses- Offense.

That's pretty much all there is.



&gt;Thirdly, how do players switch teams?


During a transfer season, a team bids for a player from another club, and if the team agrees then they make an agreement of personal terms if that works well then he joins the club. If your wondering if the personal terms ever not work? Yes last year there was a guy who failed a physical, and we didn't sign him because of it.


&gt;How do teams find players to pursue?


Scouts. 


&gt;Is there a draft?


No, in Soccer, most teams have a youth academy, and players transition from the youth academy to first team when they or their clubs are ready. If your curious, Yes you can buy Youth players from other teams. 


&gt;Traditions?

I guess every year we commemorate the Hillsborough disaster. Oh which reminds me if you want to keep your balls don't link. The sun, and daily mail. Daily mail is a tabloid piece of shit, and the sun posted lies about liverpool. 

&gt;How about some chants?

&gt;Team nickname

Reds, the fans in our stadium(named Anfield) are called the Kop or Kopites(I've heard both). 

&gt;What does the team's future look like?


Looks good we have great owners who have great interest in our club and we have well picked manager.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"&gt; Thirdly, how do players switch teams? How do 'transfers' work? Is there a draft?

Players sign a contract with the club they are at for X number of years on Y salary/week. There's other clauses sometimes as well. Other teams can then place offers for that player (to 'buy out' their current contract) with the club, and if the club finds an offer they believe is suitable, they accept it. The bidding team then talks to the player and their agent to agree terms to a new contract.

If a player's contract comes to an end and his club does not offer him a new deal, he is a free agent who can be signed without paying a transfer fee - the new club just need to agree terms on a contract for him.

There is no draft.

&gt; How do teams find players to pursue?

Youtube videos! No, seriously, they have scouts, just like any other sport.

I've gotta go now, so I'll stop. People have answered stuff about the tradition and history already, but one last thing: 

&gt; What does the team's future look like?

Optimistic. We have new American owners, FSG, who have achieved previous sporting success with the Red Sox, another big name who lost their way. They're still new to football, but after 18 months they're starting to back their instincts a bit more. The new coach Rodgers is inexperienced at this level but his style of football is positive, and given time he can hopefully be a success. Our squad does have the talent to finish top 4, and once we return to the Champions League we can spend more on players and attract a better quality of player. It'll take time, so we need to be patient, but after a few years of confusion and regression, we're heading in the right direction.",0,1339543374,null,0,false,0,c4zs53c,t3_uyqjh,t1_c4zs53c,t1_c4zrzqg,null,1429129051,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

Which, last I checked, is not in accordance with the purpose of this sub.

What's even more relevant is that it isn't all atheist content that people want blocked.  Just any and all content, regardless of subject matter, from a sub which does not represent all of atheism.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Because the fixed point in Waters of Mars wasn't Adelaide Brooke dying on Mars. It was her just plain dying. Location was not specified, whereas in series 6 arc, it was.

Yes, in Let's Kill Hitler when Mels is regenerating into River, she said that the last time she did it, she was a toddler in New York. It wasn't explained how she got to Amy and Rory but she had many years. She could've gotten to the UK in many ways.

Why isn't Amy more upset? Well if your baby that you never knew you had was abducted from you and trained to kill your best friend and also grows up to be another mysterious friend of yours, how would you feel? Not distraught or angry, just seriously seriously emotionally confused.

Rory doesn't have a room, the exit was trying to get him out. We don't know the Doctor's room but there are many theories, most being that the Doctor has fear and faith in himself.

River was programmed as a tiny kid before she met Amy and Rory. How did she not become normal by being around them? Well you know the stereotype of serial killers turning out to be that real friendly neighbor who lives down your street and you think, wow he seemed so nice.

No, the Big Bang restored everything to exactly how it was. Nothing changed except that the Doctor, Amy, and Rory are aware of a plot. But it didn't actually change anything that happened in history. Everything was restored. They essentially remember something that never happened- which happens a lot in Doctor Who.

Yes it's weird what River says. She becomes an archeologist because it's a good way to find the Doctor since he's all over history. Archeologists are cool. Bernice Summerfield, Laura Croft...

Yeah she knows it all. Pretty much for most of her life. Probably by the time she gets to Amy's and Rory's and becomes their friends.
