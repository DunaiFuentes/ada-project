Why?

Because we'd take a hefty financial hit to get rid of him. According to Wikipedia:-
""an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £16 million""
I doubt we'd get £8-10million for him over the summer, and he was showing flickers of form towards the end of the season.

Financially we have nothing to lose by keeping him at least until Christmas and see if he can pick up his form. Even if he doesn't it's unlikely he'll be worth less then than he is now. I don't think we have much to lose giving him another 6-12 months then re-evaluating.

I have no problem with us signing another winger who operates mainly on the left and introduce a little more competition for places, mind you.

I mean it's like a prison that's really far away + some forced labour to make people build your empire without pay and that's about it, isn't it, when it comes down to it. I guess some significance that could be gleamed from it is about how society treat criminals, prison boats, prisons, colonies overflowing. Didn't do very much to stop the Bow Street Runners from working hard.

It's shrouded in myth too, this idea of white people coming in and civilising the place, which is wrong in two ways: first, they weren't all white; second, they were practically committing genocide. And yet this day is celebrated by some.

But in terms of it's place in British history? Where does it stand? Not many places. Politics in Australia changed after the second world war, then the people changed and they, in a lot of ways got over Britain, in no small part thanks to the changing of how travelling between the two places changed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"My first exposure to Arsenal was about 12 years ago when my first team (PAOK; Spurs are a close second but being a PAOK fan is genetic!) knocked them out of the European cup. I had family and friends that went there and since then have said only bad things about Arsenal. Most people in northern Greece that follow the English game piggybacked on ManU, Liverpool, or Chelsea. Arsenal is hated still because of the way the PAOK fans saw the Arsenal fans treat their own players.

Growing up with everyone talkin badly about Arsenal just gave me a natural aversion to them. Being a PAOK fan you have to put up with a lot of crap: all the other big teams hate you, you're always the underdog, people always expect you to fail, and the media hates you. I saw some resemblance between PAOK and Spurs so I started following them...the fan base sold me! Spurs just absolutely have the best fan base in England. 

You can tell almost all Spurs fans LOVE the team, not just the score the teams gets. If Arsenal loses, the fans spew so much hatred its ridiculous. Looking at r/gunners now it's so obvious what their singular purpose is - to end the season over Spurs. This hatred between fans is almost all on their side. If Arsenal lost 5-2 to Spurs half of their fan base would jump ship to City (or whoever else is at the top that week). Not Spurs fans...if youre a Spurs fan you're there through thick and thin, when your team wins big and when it sucks terribly for three months in a row. You don't lose one or two games and then insult the players.

And just as a disclaimer: i have been saying I want Redknapp to leave. But I haven't insulted him - really, I don't think he has the tactical nous to be a top - 4 manager. 

I don't buy into all the self loathing sk easily anyway - being a PAOK fan is just so heartbreaking. I'm used to much worse sk watching Spurs is always such a pleasure! 

I should be flying to London in September to catch one of the first few matches of the season and if all goes well after I graduate in December I'll be moving to Copenhagen. A short enough flight from London I'll most definitely become a season ticket holder and be at WHL every home match...

Sure, we bitch and moan a bit when we hit a losing streak, we'll sigh and grumble when we lose to a team that by all reasonable expectations we should dominate, but we're not going anywhere.

And yeah - you don't need to explain Redknapp. There's a difference between saying somebody's head isn't in the game (or isn't playing for the club rather than themselves, or whatever) and needs to go and insulting them and booing or whatever.

Players and managers come and go. It's the fans that are the true heart of a club. They're the ones you sit beside at pubs, in the stands, and the culture of their fans is far slower to change; it's years or decades or even a century of traditions and attitudes.

Surely no-one is denying that these men should be tried, and if they are found to have committed the actions of the crime knowingly and deliberately then they must be found guilty. I don't see how race comes into that, in which case, are we suggesting that race be considered as part of sentencing?

So is race an aggravating factor? Should people be punished more severely because they are from a certain racial background? Surely not. I can't see any way to interpret that other than blatant racism.

So is race a mitigating factor? Are we to believe that certain races are culturally more likely to think rape of minors is acceptable and that therefore they should be considered less responsible for their actions? This seems pretty dubious. Firstly this seems to be highly offensive to pakistani people (or muslims) most of whom are likely not child rapists. Secondly, residents of a country should be subject entirely and exclusively to the laws of that country, I would think. Justice is meant to enact equal treatment of all. By choosing to reside within a country you subject yourself to the laws of that country entirely.

true,thebuggalo,null,null,"I really enjoyed Donna.  She was a bit rough to begin with, but after a few episodes she comes into her own, and you can truly appreciate her as her own character.  In my opinion, Martha wasn't bad, but coming off of Rose, it just felt like the same (but not as good).  Donna was something totally different, and so I could judge her without making comparisons to Rose or Martha.  I felt like we really got to see Donna change as she travelled.  She was almost humbled by her experiences, but wasn't afraid to voice her opinion.  It might come off as annoying at times, but you can't deny that she had a definite impact on the Doctor.  She helped him make tough decisions.  The Doctor doesn't always need a spunky girl who can help save the day, sometimes he needs someone to show him the human side of things and remind him of his responsibilities.  Which I think Donna did very well.  She is my favorite companion and I really wish more people would give her a chance, instead of immediately being against her from her Christmas episode.  I wasn't a big fan of her then either, but by the end of her run, I can see the impact she had on the Doctor.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Alright, not everything's going to make sense because frankly there are a lot of holes in the story right now. Whether they will be filled in yet remains to be seen, but without spoiling the Sixth Series, here's a recap:

The TARDIS mysteriously navigates itself to the date of Amy's wedding, where it suddenly goes critical and detonates in the center of the Solar System.

It's pilot at the time, River Song, was trapped in the TARDIS's automatic emergency loop to protect her, keeping her life in the second before detonation. The Doctor uses his Vortex Manipulator to jump into the TARDIS and rescue her before the loop degrades.

This explosion deteriorates the universe to a shadow of a state. This destroyed universe has no stars and has a world with a myth of a ""Pandorica"" and a ""Last Centurion"".

In this degraded universe all alien life is destroyed save an Auton duplicate with Rory's mind because reasons.

Under the instruction of the Doctor, Rory opens the Pandorica in 106 Stonehenge, removes the prisoner Doctor from it, and places Amy into it.

Over two thousand years of Rory standing next to a box later it is the present and the Doctor pilots the Pandorica into the exploding TARDIS in hopes of ""rebooting the universe"" by striking the TARDIS explosion with non-degraded universal particles that were stored in the Pandorica.

This (somehow) works, but as the universe begins to reboot (somehow based on Amy's memories because wall-crack reasons) the Doctor experiences time in backward flashes.

Leaving a cleverly hidden message for Amy and electing to walk into a crack instead of reliving the rest of his life in reverse the Doctor is erased from existence.

The universe reboots properly (well, as properly as one could hope. Rory has Auton Rory's memories for some reason now), but there is no Doctor. 

After being surreptitiously given a blue diary by River Song Amy remembers the Doctor and recalls him into existence.

Rory and Amy get married and all is well in the TARDIS (which has also been recalled into existence).

...

We learn of a religious order known as ""The Silence"" whose sole duty is to ensure that silence falls when the question is asked.

The question being referred to is ""Doctor Who?"" and it will be asked of the Doctor at the Fields of Trenzalore, where all questions must be answered and be answered completely and truthfully *what the exact nature of the fields are and why they can do this we have no idea).

The answering of the question would lead to ""the Fall of the Eleventh"", whatever that actually means.

The Silence, in an attempt to silence the Doctor and fulfill a fixed-point prophecy set out to put Melody Pond into an Apollo 11 spacesuit, have her emerge from Lake Silencio on April 22, 2011 and at 5:02 p.m. murder the Doctor.

To do this the Silence must first acquire the baby and train her to kill the Doctor. They do so by successfully kidnapping the pregnant Amy Pond and replacing her with a flesh duplicate.

The Doctor sees through the ruse and promises to rescue the kidnapped Amy, which he does. But not after Mme. Kavorkian, a member of the Silence, steals away with young Melody Pond. It is at this point the Doctor discovers that little Melody is ""human plus Time Lord"" because vortex-reasons.

The Silence then leave Melody Pond on earth in a semi-abandoned Floridian orphanage and develop a suit to contain her from the Apollo 11 program, as the Silents apparently cannot develop their own technology.

Melody, taking the name ""Alexander Jefferson Adams"", escapes from the Silents custody somehow, busting out of the suit's restraints (but somehow being back in the suit?) and attempts to warn her mother, Amy.

The Doctor post-hypnotically forces all of humanity to slaughter the Silence via the Moon Landing transmission. He does this without knowing the species intents or nature and does so without hesitation. Very un-Doctorish.

Little ""Alexander"" starves to death on the streets of New York and turns into a toddler. She says that she ""tracked down"" her parents and then lived alongside them as their friend ""Mels"".

For some reason both aware of her training to kill the Doctor and again for some reason still wanting to go through with it (but not shooting him on-sight, because that would actually make sense) she poisons the Doctor with a poison kiss.

The Doctor whispers something into ""Mel River's"" ear, something she believes would be assumedly common knowledge. Realizing that she is to become River Song, the Doctor's love she spares his life seconds after the poison consumes him, spending all her regenerations ""in one go"".

But the Doctor still must face death. The Silence had apparently followed River even after her escape and slap her in an *automated* Apollo suit with the intent of killing the Doctor.

At the moment when River is to kill the doctor she ""cleverly"" disengages the weapons systems on the suit, preventing a fixed point in time and making the universe a giant clusterfuck of time and weirdness.

She gets... married? To the Doctor?

And then she finally commits and shoots his fucking brains out.

But it turns out the Doctor found a loophole. By placing himself in a Tesselecta the Doctor was able to physically be on the beach and physically be shot at by River at the proper time and ""die"" while not actually dying.

The Doctor resolves that he's ""gotten too big"" and decides to ""lay low and slip into the shadows"" and let everyone think he's dead (which is undone in the very next episode, so fuck it all.)

But the Doctor knows the Question is still waiting for him...

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"Chillax, homeslice. As I said, it's a question of *willful* ignorance. If there's a fan out there who, say, simply doesn't care about *Doctor Who*'s history, then I would have to confess to a raised eyebrow. 

I've conversed with a Redditor who had watched some classic episodes of *Doctor Who*, but just couldn't get into it. The pacing, the acting, the special effects, the story styles just didn't click with him. He has a point, of course, but I'd give him props because he tried. The idea of, say, almost dogmatically snubbing the classic series, with absolutely no interest in even giving it a shot, is what would make me upvote the original submission. 

Are these newer fans fans of the show? By definition, of course they are. However, when it would come to *Doctor Who*, I suspect we wouldn't have much to talk about beyond a certain point. If, for example, I wanted to discuss the evolution of the Doctor's character, I certainly couldn't do so if I limited myself to just the last three Doctors, even if that happens to be a new fan's sole frame of reference. 

To that end, it's somewhat frustrating. There's a great, great legacy behind Steven Moffat's catchphrases and Murray Gold's endless attempts to win an Academy Award. When that legacy is ignored and/or snubbed, yes, it's a little disappointing. Hence my upvote. It's certainly nothing personal against the fans who can't watch the classic series. For the fans who won't - the ones who'd cosplay with bowtie and fez, but when quizzed, would tell you that they just don't care about *Doctor Who* pre-2005 - then again, it's not *personal* (my ego isn't that fragile), but as I said before, we wouldn't have much to talk about vis-a-vis *Doctor Who*. 

I hope this addresses any confusion regarding respective appreciations of a television show, one which carries unique circumstances of appreciation, approach and perspective. 

Also, all Classic episodes are available on Dailymotion.

We have professional soldiers who do all the soldiering, and it's much harder for them to argue against the merits of any particular war since fighting is what they signed up for, whereas sending a random cross-section of people overseas to fight an unpopular war is likely to be much more strongly resisted.  Citizen armies and the population from which they're drawn need to be far more convinced they're fighting for a good cause.

That being said, I pretty much agree with your points.  Since I despise the State, I'd never fight for it.  Fighting for my friends, family, community, society and ideals; well that's another matter.

Whilst it would be useful for politicians to have a greater perspective of military service, I doubt it would work out like that in practice. People in positions of privilege rarely have to go through national service along with the common man. They will be given positions as officers and live a separate life to those that would actually be fighting. 

As for politicians being less likely to start wars, I am unsure of this. If we had national service we would have a combat ready adult population who would most likely accept conscription (why else would they submit to national service). This would give the state significant power over foreign enemies who don't have national service (assuming the war isn't against China or such). Not that it really matters anyway, if we entered a war and it got to the point where we required conscription it would probably mean the end of our society as we know it.

I think it is too easy for politicians to convince the masses of the need for war anyway. Giving everyone a uniform and a gun would most likely exacerbate that.

I'd say the vast majority of them do, they've already been thoroughly assessed including using their own doctors recommendations when they made their Disability claims in the first place. OK there may be a few  false claims from good liars putting on a show but the government is taking the stance that most people claiming are just on the take and have set up their own target driven assessment process on that premise.

 I mean things like mental health problems can take months to asses and don't always manifest themselves at will, my friend B is like this, she appears completely normal 99% of the time but suffers from manic depression and ridiculous panic attacks that appear from absolutely nowhere ( believe me I've been there when it's happened, she nearly smashed up a book shop because she literally couldn't calm herself down, then she'll lock herself away and go completely off the radar for a few days, sometimes weeks, afterwards to cope ) She's just not in control at all when it happens.  She wants to work, is qualified to work and was an advertising exec on £80,000 up until a few years ago when she was sacked for this reason, but she actually can't work because of these attacks. 

So in her case this is a quick panel assessment and they're in no position to reach any conclusion by having a ""quick chat"" with her therefore she'll lose her benefit unless she puts herself up for work and, to be honest, she'd be a danger in the workplace to anyone else if/when she loses it and useless afterwards to any employer so they'll just end up letting her go and she'll be back to square one, probably signed off as I don't think you can claim if you've been fired ( not 100% sure about this though )   

So basically for people like B this system is completely flawed. I'm sure they're are many other illnesses this panel will skim over to reach their targets too. As we are already seeing.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"Because people are emotional creatures, and so rational decision making doesn't work in politics.

Take for example the fuss last week over the closure of Remcor factories; you don’t need a social study to see that it was the sensible, rational decision to take. Those factories had been hovering up a huge chunk of the disabilities budget for years with little to show for it. Reforms and restructurings had previously been attempted without turning much around; many of the factories are still operating at a loss despite huge taxpayer subsidies.

So why not take our scant resources and invest them somewhere else, where the public might see more of a return? It makes sense. It’s the rational thing to do.

The UK Reddit community is (I would argue) of above average intelligence and education, with many working or studying in science or science related fields. But was their reaction calm, rational acceptance of a sensible decision? Or was it emotional outrage about the apparent political situation; a conservative minister taking away from societies vulnerable?

It’s a rhetorical question; the answer is obvious.

Politics can never be just about figuring out the best course and implementing it, because that will lead you down a path of telling people what’s ‘best’ for them (and there is a little too much authoritarianism in left-wing politics for my liking already).

Politics must always relate to peoples emotions and prejudices if it’s to have any meaning to them, if democracy is going to work. That might mean taking courses which aren’t the right ones from a rational point of view but are the right ones from the public's point of view, but then the essence of democracy is having the freedom to make decisions, even if (objectively speaking) they are the wrong decisions.

The Doctor is a time traveler, so it makes sense that he could run into someone who knows him well but he doesn't know (yet) at all.  Making her his future girlfriend is similarly tantalizing.  

The problem is the execution.  First, she should have **only** been his future girlfriend or wife.  All of that other nonsense, with her [spoiler](/s ""being the daughter of his Companions and being trained from birth to be a psychopathic assassin out to kill him, blah blah blah"") was more like bad comic book writing.  (I've also heard it compared to a Mexican Soap Opera out here.)  

Another problem is that despite River now having been present in three consecutive seasons, we never actually SEE them as a couple.  Their entire relationship is *still* only told in the future tense.  All we ever get is River TALKING about going out on dates with the Doctor.  While this would work for a couple stories, at this point, I feel like the writers now just want the convenience of the Doctor having a lover without ever taking the time out to actually do the character work necessary to establish the relationship as believable.  (It doesn't help that, frankly, I don't feel Matt Smith and Alex Kingston have any chemistry at all.)

And, on top of all that, they can't even keep their story straight.  The idea they introduced that River &amp; The Doctor's timelines are directly inverse was both A)totally illogical, and B)*immediately* discarded the first time it became inconvenient.  That they used that premise to milk some tears out of the audience (and River) only to throw it away a couple episodes later further enhances the feeling that it's nothing but cheap melodrama.

At this point, I think the best thing they could possibly do with River is to quit using her for some time.  Preferably until the next Regeneration.  Then, if they want to go back to the plotline, they should cast a Doctor who does have some chemistry with Kingston (and is perhaps a bit closer to her in age), and actually start writing them as a couple rather than as a portable tragic plot device.

However, after years of implicit guarantees to the banks against failure this is no longer possible. The banks are too large and are too interconnected for one to fail in this country. And if we did manage to let any of them fail successfully then we would just end up with a smaller number of banks to choose from. 

The government should allow more entrepreneurs to set up new banks (which, in part, they have done) so as to increase competition and make the economy less dependant on large banks. It is not too little or too much regulation that caused the crisis, it was simply bad regulation.

As for sending bankers to prison, who do you mean? Should it be illegal to make a bad decision? Fraudulent activities should be punished, but this was not all fraud, it was stupidity and greed. The senior managers created an environment in which high risk was acceptable and that informed how their employees behaved. They should be punished by losing their jobs for incompetence, not prison.

Bailing out a country though is a completely different matter. If Greece cannot pay the interest on its debt then the country will have to declare bankruptcy, meaning that it will not be able to sell bonds on the market until investors are confident again. The people of Greece will suffer because of the failings of their government. This will also have consequences for the rest of Europe, should the EU let a country go bankrupt, countries on the brink will lose investor confidence and perhaps face bankruptcy themselves. This can easily spiral out of control (more so than it already has). It is the consensus among economists that bailing out countries is the best way to minimise damage to human well being, and as far as I am concerned that is what governments should be aiming to do, whilst at the same time ensuring that we do not repeat the same mistakes again.",0,1336991087,null,0,false,0,c4ntkw5,t3_tm719,t1_c4ntkw5,t1_c4ntf7c,null,1428921193,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

QPR were playing a full strength City team that have spent all season dominating almost everyone else in the league, and who were throwing everything they had at securing the league and avoiding yet another embarassment at the hands of United (so much so they spent most of the match tripping over themselves for trying too hard), and QPR were forced to do it a man down for a huge chunk of the match, the entire final forty minutes. If they really didn't care they wouldn't have gone 2-1 up in the first place, let alone have held on as long as they did. For you to call them cowards is frankly a little preposterous.

I don't feel too bad either way to be honest - I really wanted Villa to go down and Bolton and QPR to stay up - but at least QPR might be capable of doing a little more than tread water next season, which is likely what Bolton would have done. Though my opinion on Bolton has picked up under Coyle, all those years of them under Allardyce makes it hard to really like them even now, so I'm not that bothered to see them go for a while - they'll be straight back up anyway with Coyle at the helm.

Given that when I really started getting into watching football rather than just playing at school QPR was a topflight club (Premier League founding members no less), it kind of feels irrationally right that they be in the mix. As for QPR being our rivals, they're hardly high on the list are they, even among London clubs - you're definitely right saying technically. And I've followed them a bit in the last few years because our loan connections with them - it was a stint at QPR that laid the foundation's for our player of the season's development don't forget. All in all I just find them a difficult club to dislike at the moment.

And I quite like Hughes - maybe seeing him get a bit screwed over by City did it, but I suspect it was being such a fan of his as a player - such a good volleyer of a football, one of the best for me, and it's can be hard to get over having those sort of feelings when you're young. It stupid, because I know he's acted like a right arse at times in his managerial career.

So I didn't really want them to go down, and I don't think they deserved to either - league table rarely lies, and they've put in some decent performances in recent months to drag themselves out of the mire.

Ultimately, if growth is all you care about, then by all means, borrow debt today and sod the next generation who have to pay it off.

I am not ideologically opposed to borrowing to fund investment - but when you are spending over £100,000 per job created, you do have to ask if that is a sensible use for the money - and whether the debt built up could be repaid within the economic cycle.

This ultimately is the problem with all sides of the debate - neither seems willing (or maybe able) to work out whether borrowing £100 billion to create jobs will be repaid though the taxes those jobs will create.

Now, if you are saying that we should spend the money regardless, then fair enough - but you are saying that people today will have a lifestyle that they are not having to pay for.

It makes more sense to ensure that investment spent today is affordable and can be repaid by the effects of that spending. Otherwise you are condemning future generations to pay off the cost of our comforts.

Minimum pricing is aimed towards those purchasing 3L of Frosty Jacks to consume in the park.  The other option which has always been favoured by the government is to keep raising the duty on ALL alcohol, which as we've seen only drives people towards the cheap rough stuff.  With this measure we can impose financial disincentives on the cheap stuff (which is associated with high levels of anti-social behaviour) without having to punish the average drinker.

Are you saying this based on any facts or is this just the way you would like things to be? The more I look into it the more it seems that the majority of economists are against austerity until the economy has recovered.

&gt;Ultimately, if growth is all you care about, then by all means, borrow debt today and sod the next generation who have to pay it off.

Ultimately, if paying off the debt is all you care about, then by all means, cut public spending by 100% and sod the next generation (the ones who survive) who have to rebuild society.

&gt;I am not ideologically opposed to borrowing to fund investment - but when you are spending over £100,000 per job created, you do have to ask if that is a sensible use for the money - and whether the debt built up could be repaid within the economic cycle.

Where did the £100k figure come from? Labour's job creation plan was creating jobs for £28k each, the Conservative's plan was working a little less well at £33k each, still a lot better than £100k each. And as I have pointed out before minimum wage is only £11k each so it seems the government could created jobs more cheaply if it choose to do employ people directly for that amount.

&gt;This ultimately is the problem with all sides of the debate - neither seems willing (or maybe able) to work out whether borrowing £100 billion to create jobs will be repaid though the taxes those jobs will create.

I agree with you there. I guess it is very hard to predict what the outcome will be. But from my point of view there is empirical evidence, in the form of the current double dip recession, that the current austerity measures go too far. If cutting government spending causes the economy to shrink then tax revenue will fall as a result and the whole thing will end up as one self-defeating spiral.

&gt;Now, if you are saying that we should spend the money regardless, then fair enough - but you are saying that people today will have a lifestyle that they are not having to pay for.

&gt;It makes more sense to ensure that investment spent today is affordable and can be repaid by the effects of that spending. Otherwise you are condemning future generations to pay off the cost of our comforts.

I don't think we need a large increase in total spending. We can still try and make the public sector more efficient, but the money saved could then be used to invest in stimulus projects to build houses, roads, water pipes and broadband connections. Krugman estimates that if a stimulus is done properly, for every £1 that £1.50 is added to GDP thanks to the extra benefits of someone having a job and spending more money which supports other people in jobs etc. etc. As long as we don't go too crazy with spending then the deficit will be eliminated by rising GDP and tax revenues.

&gt;...or course, you can create hundreds of thousands of jobs at a simple stroke by forcing companies to replace machines with people. But that is building Chinese dams with spoons, and very stupid.

In the long term I think most jobs will be able to be replaced with machines, which should lead to a utopia but would more likely lead to disaster for most people as employment is the best way we currently have of redistributing wealth. When it comes to this we will need some way of making sure everyone can get an income either by job creation schemes or by some sort of negative income tax funded by taxing people who are earning.",0,1337000027,null,0,false,0,c4nuczv,t3_tmarp,t1_c4nuczv,t1_c4nu4l3,null,1428921561,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I've been doing 300+ miles a WEEK on the motorways and the general standard of driving is shocking. I'm 22 and drive a sports car, and my father's a police officer who taught me good driving technique.

I see, on a daily basis, extremely dangerous tailgating at speeds of 100mph+, regular undertaking of multiple cars at high speeds, middle-lane-morons who, no matter how long you sit at a safe distance behind them flashing, they don't move, and even sit there after you overtake and shift into the far left... they just SIT there.

I am all for increased speed limits on UK roads, and in fact, LESS policing of speeds and more focus on the absolute IDIOTS out there. If you're driving a bloody Corsa with bad tyres and no ABS at 100mph, you're an idiot. Put that 100mph speed into a new car with new tyres, good ABS and a driver who isn't an idiot, and you're fine.

I mean, for fucks sake, we've been using the 70mph speed limit on and off since the 40s! Until it was made permanent in 1977/8 (I forget which). I mean... the safety of cars has grown exponentially since then, and I think that the speed limits and road policing has not grown to take this into account.

It's perfectly OK for the Guardian to be left wing, and for the Sun to be right wing, because both are owned by private companies and I am perfectly at liberty to ignore their output at no loss to myself.

But I cannot ignore the BBC's output if I wish to view *any* television in the UK because that requires me to pay my portion of the BBC's funding. So it *has* to be neutral and to be seen to be neutral.

The central argument that Dear Old Boris is putting forward - that the BBC is fundamentally Left Wing - is what must be tackled here. And if we cannot adequately tackle that, only *then* do we need to consider whether his proposed solution is suitable and adequate.

I'm firmly of the opinion that *institutionally* the BBC is neutral although there can be many individual accusations of Bias one way or the other. As prime evidence in that case would be the assertion that **all** parties find cause to complain about unfair coverage by the BBC, and that their tendency to do so increases with the amount of power they have. So that the worst one can possibly state about the BBC would be that it's institutionally anti-establishment, not that it's biased towards one political viewpoint or another.

And as to the proposed remedy: the BBC has adopted a model of oversight from an independent Trust, precisely to ensure that the organisation does not develop institutional political bias (amongst other goals).

Yes, though it is extremely low key and tends to mostly be hunters/farmers/sports shooters looking to lighten the regulatory burden on themselves rather than people looking to liberalise the gun laws into something like the US. There are those too, but they're generally considered nuts.

2. I doubt it has much to do with it, but I also don't think opinion matters. It's a question of fact whether the gun laws do that, not opinion, and I have seen no studies on the subject. If it is the case that it does, then it would seem to be the tradeoff for reducing truly violent crime.

3. No, few people are stupid enough to face down a mob even if they do have small arms, and the last thing you want is to focus a mob's anger on you rather than your property. At best, it would have changed nothing, at worst some of the rioters might have come armed or taken guns from shops etc. Not something I want to see.

This is a good thing though. Because serious relationships and the Doctor just don't work. They're unrealistic and unbelievable. (See: Rose) Although, to be fair, there are exceptions to this rule (""Girl in the Fireplace"") but generally it's a topic you want to avoid.

The way I see River and the Doctor's relationship is that she thinks he's pretty fly, and flirts with him, and he humours her because he knows she's going to die and kind of pretends to be her boyfriend. I don't think he loves her.

&gt; At this point, I think the best thing they could possibly do with River is to quit using her for some time. Preferably until the next Regeneration

The players Kenny have bought have shown glimpses of their quality but haven't returned with goals, assists and clean sheets, which are more important than positive displays in the football business. This preludes the second point.

The fan experience can firstly be improved by better home performances. Nothing is more satisfying to a fan than a win at home. Furthermore, a new stadium would allow more fans to watch the game, increasing revenue and at the FSG's discretion, ticket prices could be reduced. That would definitely be a crowd pleaser. 

With the introduction of Warrior branded sportswear, we now rely on football supporters to recognise the club brand rather than the shirt brand. In America revenue will likely increase, perhaps not so much in Asia. We rely on our reputation now to make us successful globally which is very important for the FSG.

    Transfers

This will more than likely become a topic of discussion. Dalglish has spent a net total of £35million. Less of that being the FSG's money with the sale of players like Torres and Babel. Despite this now. If Kenny is going to spend over £100million again, he has no excuses and the FSG will not be profiting. The sale of players like Downing and Carroll would not solve any problems, nor reimburse the FSG, so Dalglish is going to have to explain his future plans including these players probably.

    My opinion

I personally feel if Dalglish goes, it'll be a tough hunt for a manager willing to take us on. However the lure of available transfer funds, European football and lowered expectations (than champions league football immediately) would attract good managers. However if he doesn't go, he gets more time to gel a team together, learn from the mistakes made this season and keep most of the good current players.

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; If you usually stay at or above the limit then you won't see what I'm taking about. When you do any kind of a long journey at 60, and overtake trucks towing uphill at 55 on a two lane stretch, you definitely get impatient tailgaters who cannot wait for you to get done with their lane. This happens much less when you are around the 70 mark.

A part of safe overtaking is the speed you choose to do it at. This is exeplified on single-lane roads where you need to minimise the time spent on the wrong side of the road (hence why I get a run-up and do it at around 80-85).

It's the same on dual or triple carriageways though - you should match the speed of the traffic in the lane you're in. Although you may be happily chugging along doing 60, if you need to overtake someone doing 55, 5mph isn't really enough closing speed not to inconvenience others (as you're doing less than the average speed for the middle lane, and *dangerously* less than for the overtaking lane).

Packages sent from the US via USPS via any guaranteed service are normally delivered via ParcelForce. In this instance, you pay a handling fee of £13.50, VAT and customs charges (which vary by the item). I never see false customs declarations from the US for some reason.

Packages sent from the US via USPS on a slow service are normally delivered by Royal Mail and I have been charged extra very infrequently.

Courier services from the US vary. I have seen two situations - the package is delivered and I get a letter in the post a few days later asking for the charges, or they ask for cash on delivery at my door. I don't get the rhyme or reason.

Recently I have been dealing with Mouser in the US and they sort out the VAT and customs charges. This has two upsides - what I pay at checkout is what I pay in total, and it is much quicker to arrive (48 hours total). I don't know how they do this.

From other countries it is more common for the customs declaration to be misdeclared. Hong Kong always seems to do this, even when ordering from big, reputable companies. If it gets through without being caught, this is great - I pay nothing. If they catch my ""$5"" of components that I paid $200 for and then decide that they cost $400 at list price, I get totally raped in VAT and customs.

I think best practise is to warn the person ordering that they will be subject to these charges, and they can be a lot more than you were expecting.

Well yes obviously huge trucks which take upwards of a minute to pass each other are incredibly annoying (especially when they end up giving up and pulling back in, always a classic) but I'm talking about an increased level of frustration that is palpable when you drive under the limit.  In fact, I've heard from IAM instructors that driving more than 3mph under the limit is dangerous because it encourages people to take a risk and overtake.  Apparently if you're at the limit they are more likely to think, well, the risk of death *and* points isn't enough to bother.

The point, to me, is just that raising the speed limit increases the expected speed, the normal speed.  Whatever the safety stats say, there isn't a car made which doesn't tail off in efficiency over about 60mph.  Much as I love speed, I also love breathing and not being insanely poor.

As an aside, regarding ""I overtake on public roads at 85mph because it's safer"" - do you really think for one second that a cop who clicks you doing *25mph over the limit on the wrong side of the road* is going to care about your opinion on road safety?

The key to saving your customers and yourself money is to mark the package as a GIFT or declare the value as something very low, like £1. Then, no VAT is payable. Of course, the HMRC might disagree and impose it anyway, but at least you tried.

Import VAT is covered at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/tax-and-duty.htm#3

It's not a government department anymore so they aren't trying to find you a job, they're trying to get you to sign on and then sign off again really quickly. This way their statistics will look like you came to them and found a job really fast.

What actually happens is you sign on to get the money then they make so many outrageous demands on you that you can't actually find a job. They won't let you do internships and they won't let you do volunteer work for more than 16 hours a week. There's no way to not take the money either, you can't just use them to help you find a job, you have to be taking their money which means you have to quit work which means you have to live on what they give you and once you get stuck like that it's very hard to get out of that rut. 

It's what people talk about when they call it the poverty trap. You sign on to get money so you can afford to live and they won't help you get a job they'll just keep giving you the tiny amount.

You're better off using a recruitment company, if you're applying for jobs anyway then the only thing which you'll get out of them is the weekly money and for me at least, it wasn't worth it.

Everything in it's supposed to look like a hodgepodge of the odd and quirky jumbled together amidst the fantastical and advanced. Overall it creates this theme of madcap whimsy while not appearing dissonant.

It's clearly an aesthetic choice rather than a measure to cut costs, and I can see the rationale behind it.

Unlike the other TARDISes before it which have contrasted with the odd, dated and out-of-place exterior with clean white science fiction-y interiors, this new design continues the motif. The outside's a police box for a spaceship, so it has a typewriter for coordinate setting and water faucets for directional controls.

Without trying to sound like a dick, you have an online store and you only just realised this? Most people don't read anything, let alone boring lists of FAQs. The thing is, it's YOUR fault as website owner. You need to cater for your customers, and if that means spoon-feeding them at the pace of a child, so be it. People have extremely short attention spans and things need to be be REALLY obvious for people to cope with. 

During the checkout, if you select UK as the delivery address, there should be a big red notice that appears next to it saying that there may be VAT due. And the customer should need to approve of that message before moving on. Don't just put a little bit of writing or a link to the FAQ next to the address box. I already guarantee that most people will not see it or will just ignore it.

I've bought from abroad plenty of times, and never had an issue. Sometimes there's VAT to pay, and other times there isn't.

Of course, some customers will chance it that they won't have to pay VAT. And so you won't reduce your return rate to 0%.

I am a bit bitter about this because it seems overly strict. I understand that they are trying to prevent touting and this is a positive, but the way they are doing it is wrong. Say you go to a couple of games a year, non season ticket holder nor a club member, and take your 2 children, you can only buy one ticket for the final as the kids obviously are unable to buy a tickets for games they have been to. A solution for touting would be to print the name of the person allocated the ticket on the ticket and they need to show ID to be able to enter the ground.

Need more competition for spots rather than gifting EPL starting lineup status to mediocre players. I'd really like to see us sign a half dozen youth team players/prospects which I think is more likely to happen.

Out: Cole, Aquilani, Kuyt, Maxi, Wilson, Pacheco, Jones, Aurelio

Loan out: Shelvey, Spearing, Flanagan, Sterling, Robinson

Dangerous and inconsiderate driving can be within the letter of the law, of course, but there's no different speed limit, upper or lower, for particular lanes of a motorway and as a considerate road user you should be ready for anyone, in any lane, to be doing any speed from 40 up, if road and traffic conditions are appropriate.

The database is not great, and hundreds are shown each job and told to apply for it.

The results of this research were published by DH in December 2008 and relate specifically to the English population.

&gt;The existing modelling infrastructure developed for DH - known as the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model - provides a strong platform for such an investigation and so the University of Sheffield was asked to adapt the English version of the model to a Scottish population.

Synopsis of original (2009) study on English population

&gt;Could you summarise your most important findings?

&gt;- Pricing policies can be effective in reducing health, crime and employment harm.

&gt;- Pricing policies can be targeted, so that those who drink within recommended limits are hardly affected and so that very heavy drinkers, who cause by far the most alcohol-related harm, pay the most.

&gt;- Minimum unit pricing and discount bans could save hundreds of millions of pounds every year in NHS, crime and employment costs.

&gt;- If policy makers wish to see the greatest impact in terms of crime and accident prevention, through reducing the consumption of 18-24 year old binge drinkers, they need to consider policies that increase the prices of cheaper drinks available in pubs and clubs as well as supermarkets.

(I've posted this in previous threads on minimum alcohol pricing) 

My understanding is that the Scottish government did not have this option as such tax raising powers were fully reserved when the SNP proposed minimum alcohol pricing. It is worth noting that the Scotland Act 2012 allows for the creation of new taxes, so this should hopefully be less of an issue in the future.

 The Act also provides powers for new taxes to be created in Scotland and for additional taxes to be devolved.

Let us all take a moment to appreciate the surreal nature of this statement.

Visualise a switch. What does it do? It turns the room off.

The Doctor needs someone real, someone normal, to even himself out and you don't get more normal than Donna. He doesn't need someone cooperative. He needs someone to tell him when he's being a dick, which is exactly what Donna excells at. She's not love sick for him, thinking he's a hero who can do nothing wrong, he's just a friend and she has no problem having a little go at him or bluntly telling him that he's rambling and she has no idea what he's talking about.

She's a friend not someone who just blindly adores him, and that's good for him, but also he is good for her. He teaches her things she'd never even thought of and he shows her that there's more to life than being a secretary, getting married and gossiping.

That's what made her leaving so bloody cruel. All of that was undone, everything he'd taught her, everything she'd seen... And the Doctor lost an incredibly good friend.

I dislike Rose. She started out just as stupid as Donna was - a run of the mill chav. And yet within a few episodes she developed some bullshit superiority complex and strutted about acting like she was some kind of genius. Her silly love story with the Doctor cheapened his character, in my opinion, because I could see no reason why he'd fall for her.

Martha never really made an impression to be honest. She was just kind of, there.

I  ended up being overpaid for a few hundred quid, which I got a notice for before my first paycheque turned up. The staff were pretty helpful again and told me what I needed to say to get it defered or canceled. I think it got waived so that was pretty cool.

 - Xpresspost and Parcelforce are both EMS operators in our respective countries. You can see who will deliver in a given country on this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_Mail_Service

 - I think you *can technically* charge the VAT to the customers and give it to the UK govt! This way everything will glide right on through. This seems to be what Amazon.com do this when shipping items to the UK, and it's possible with the entire Eurozone I believe. You'd have to register somewhere and set it up, but just something to keep in mind - it might be a completely unworkable pain in the ass though, you'd have to look into that!

 - With regards to the above, though, from my experiences with mail and Parcelforce (I ship a lot of stuff in from the US) - we *very often* don't get charged anything at all - it's almost as if they pick out random parcels to apply charges too, even when the value is in the $100s and they should definitely have charges. With this in mind, the above might not be as good an idea as it means charging everyone instead of just some people getting charged.

 - And what other people have said is generally true, you need to make it as obvious as possible, to account for people who have no idea how the world works. Given that, though, we don't do this and no one ever returns anything with unpaid VAT, so maybe it's just us in the UK who are stupid and don't realise what happens when you import stuff from other countries - 'cos everyone else seems to know damned well from my experience! :P",0,1337017680,null,0,false,0,c4nxpfj,t3_tmi13,t1_c4nxpfj,t1_c4nvyn0,null,1428923195,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"They have decided that those who drink cheap booze are incapable of deciding when to stop drinking, and therefore must be punished by higher prices.

They have also decided that those who drink more expensive booze are the grown ups, and they are not punished.

Also, note that I am _not_ disagreeing with the experts here.  The SHAAP report recommendation for minimum alcohol pricing notes:

&gt; Minimum prices can be expressed either as a particular price or a minimum profit- margin.

A minimum profit margin would be much more even in effect, and would reduce total alcohol consumption further than an absolute floor price.  A minimum floor price most strongly affects the cider industry, which gets a preferential tax regime.

Note that my post was why people are blaming politicians - the answer is that they have, as they always done, cherry picked the 'evidence' that supports what they want, not an even balance.

For example:

&gt; Some studies show that the most popular drink in a country (e.g. beer in the UK and wine in the countries of southern Europe) is the least price sensitive. 

(SHAAP report, p 36.)

So there is evidence that raising the price will change _what_ people drink as much as how much - that, by the way, is (partly) why the Scottish Whiskey Industry, objects to the minimum pricing rules.

So, where was I?  Ah. yes - the slice that the politicians took from the experts doesn't match up.  There's a section in the SHAAP report entitled:

&gt; Why Alcohol Policies Need To Reach The Majority of Drinkers

which, as you noted above, and i did too, the minimum pricing rules blatentenly fail to meet.

I have read the evidence, and I still argue that the politicians have deliberatly chosen to characterise alcohol as a problem that needs addressed in the poor; which is divisive, incorrect and patronising.

In short - no-one has time to see someone who's wandered in who just wants to have a list of vacancies magiced up for them. It's the civil service, staff are leaving or being made redundant and there's no time for all that bollocks.

There are job points (computers) in the public area which will show you the exact same jobs on the system as the staff have access to anyway. There are no magical jobs that you can't find on their system or the websites you have already visited. If you can already look on the internet, have a CV and are what you would call 'employable' then you can't really be helped.

The only way you will get any in-depth help is by being a long-termer. You will get your own adviser who will find out if you're any more retarded than the average member of the public - if so you will get put onto a training course or CV refresher thing.

&gt;One aim of the DSRs is to ensure a minimum level of
consumer protection across the European Union (EU) although
other EU countries may have implemented them differently.
In non-EU countries you may need to take legal advice to
ensure that you comply with the legal requirements.

Basically, if you're not in the EU, speak to a lawyer for the local variation. If you're in the UK, and buying from a NON-EU store, you're not covered by the DSRs in most cases.

&gt;If you buy goods online, UK law is usually applied unless the trader states they are trading from another country. The trader should say which country's law applies on their website or in any contracts they send.

As the OP is registered in Canada, Canadian law covers the transactions. the UK DSRs don't come into play in their case.
Also, eBay auctions aren't covered. Only people who have stores that aren't selling in any auction format.

If you are budgeting or are a beginner leaning the methods then go with an all in one kit (these produce good quality beer if done right!).

With kits you get a large can of ""ready-to-go"" mix which you pour into a tub. Comes with instructions regarding sugar, hops, water, volume, etc. Beer kits hover around the 10-15 pounds cider a bit more and wine at 30 pound mark. All of these prices assume 5 gallons.

When it comes down to actual recipes then that's more of an all-grain brewing method which is where you actually buy the grains and specific hops for flavour/aroma. I'm not sure what the cost is for doing all-grain brewing but when you get to that point you'll not really care about the cost.

My mother has made several white wines from kits and they've been good, there are red wine sets available too. The people at your local homebrew shop should be able to give you a good recommendation on what'll be up your alley.

Have a look [here](http://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/) to see what sort of things you can make.

When an item is bought and shipped from overseas, the recipient has to pay import tax, VAT, and in some cases with larger parcels, even extra P&amp;P. Normally, the tax is included in the price. If you buy anything in the UK at a store, or online, you just look at the price including VAT, and think nothing of it. The fact that when you buy something from Canada, and have to pay tax at a later date, perhaps without anticipating the need to do so, is unappealing to people.

The solution is probably to put a big notice somewhere before the final sale saying that UK customers should expect to have to pay import tax and VAT on imported goods when said goods reach the border. There are a few sites that can estimate how much this will be based on what the parcel is, how much it weighs, etc.

I recently bought a rare guitar from the US, and didn't anticipate the import tax and VAT being just over £100.

If people spend exactly the same amount, and get less alcohol, then their profits are the same (the likely and desired outcome for the targets of this policy). 

If people spend more for the same amount of alcohol, the supermarkets profits increase (less likely to happen).

If people are completely priced out of the market then the supermarket loses profits (probably the least likely option).

But if the government introduces a windfall tax on supermarkets, their profits stay the same and the government has to put however much they get from it back into alcohol-related programs (NHS, GPs, PSAs, etc).

The price minimum only raises profits if it doesn't discourage people from buying as much alcohol, and even then a well-designed precision tax can negate the effects of it. On top of this, it removes supermarkets' ability to use alcohol as a loss-leader, making smaller businesses with less gains from economies of scale more competitive. It's actually a relatively efficient tax, just unpopular.

Not for how it was written (although I'll get to that later) but for how much I know about Van Gogh's life and how terribly inaccurate the episode's portrayal of his life was.

The key point is Van Gogh, although in a bout of intermittent depressive  swings during his last year of life, likely did not commit suicide and was shot in the stomach accidentally.

But beyond that his living state, the amount of friends he had, and the paintings he would (and would not) have completed at this time do not line up with what's in the episode.

Overall there are just so many inconsistencies that as someone who is familiar with the actual life of Van Gogh I couldn't quite enjoy it as much as someone coming in clean.

Additionally, I was a bit surprised at how little they try to help Van Gogh out of his depression. I mean, if they're going to change his life why not go the whole hog?

true,davegod,null,null,"&gt; What are some good pubs that will offer what the local microbrews have to offer?

If you can be in Edinburgh on the 28th June then you'll hit the real-ale jackpot as the [CAMRA Scottish Real Ale Festival](http://scottishbeerfestival.org.uk/viewpage.php?page_id=4) is on. The better beers often do run out as the weekend goes on. 

I'll note that in Britain generally it's more ""craft brewery"" than micro. Craft is pretty widespread but especially in Edinburgh, there's *lots* of pubs all over that sell craft beers. I'm disappointed if they don't have something, even the big corporate chain Wetherspoons have a range. Hit-and-miss obviously, but anywhere decent will give you a taster.

Hit the Royal Mile (marked as High St on maps). Edinburgh Castle is obligitory for tourists even if it's not really all that excisting. Nearby pub suggestion is the Castle Arms (check the terrace out the back door). Wander down to the other end of the Royal Mile and there's the Worlds' End pub. Right beside that is The Waverly pub, not a general reccomendation for tourists, but kind of kooky in a way some Redditor's might appreciate. 

Parallel to the Royal Mile is the Cowgate. Brew Dog are probably one of the most prominent (getting a bit hipster) craft breweries and they have a pub down here. Continue down this road and you're onto the Grassmarket where there's several Scottish pubs. I'll point out though that this is the area people go to get pissed, especially stag/hen nights and other groups visiting the city, so I'd suggest this be on the agenda for afternoon/evening rather than night time.

A little South of the areas above is the National Museum of Scotland. It's not really competitive with museums in the big cities, but worth an hour or two, free, and toilets. There's also the galleries off Princes St (couple more off, er, Belford Road are a bit out of the way) and Our Dynamic Earth near the Parliament.

Somewhat obligatory for tourists, and a very small hike for you, is to go up Arthur's Seat (sometimes marked as Holyrood Park on maps). There's also a nice view up on Carlton Hill, but, er, don't go up after dark. For a nice park to take a stroll and maybe picnic in, visit the Botanical Gardens. ""Serious"" national parks (e.g. The Trossachs or Cairngorms) are too away for a day trip, I guess, though it's possible that there might be some organised coach trip that leaves early morning or something.  If you get desperate there's the Pentland Hills.

Cross the road from the northern exit of Waverly train station and up a lane is the Guilford Arms, next door to that is Cafe Royal bar. There's also several pubs along Rose Street from here, including Dirty Dick's at the far (i.e. Eastern) end. North a little from there, down Young St is the Cambridge Bar which does a good burger (and serves a good pint of Deuchars IPA). The veggie burger or Portobello mushroom are apprently pretty good as veggie burgers go. 

You're also a couple of blocks from Hendersons, a vegetarian restaurant. I quite like Cafe Rouge near that, though it's French so I doubt veggie options are up to much. To be honest there's not that much going for veggies here, partly due to local diet, partly because most ""veggies"" here eat fish (your options would expand dramatically), and partly because it's not exactly prime veg growing agriculture.

Northish from there is Stockbridge and New Town, where there's several good pubs. Cloisters, Barony Bar + Cask &amp; Barrel on Broughton st, a block West is the Magnum and then another block or two the Cumberland Bar. 

If you're into old-school small cinemas, Cameo or Dominion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I work with people with mental health problems, due to the stigma and lack of knowledge they are on the short end of all this. The Changes made to the WCA as soon as the government came in meant that many people with long term mental health conditions that suffer through no fault of their own where moved to jobseekers. 

Some cannot walk into the jobcentre without help or lose days due the condition or medication and thus do not sign on and miss payments, this exasperates many conditions.

Just before the economic downturn employment was put at 20% for this group, the lowest of any disability. In 2010 the CBI put it at 18% and the study that I am helping with right now is looking at under 15%.  Most that have jobs are under employed, working few hours in jobs they are overqualified for less money than able colleagues. 

I work in a scheme that helps people with mental health conditions into employment, we are actually beating these figures but we are the exception. The simple fact is that a mental health condition means that you will not get a job, is it not a question of ability or disability it is a simple question that is you have a large amount of fit qualified people you do not tend to go for the disabled candidate. 

The question here is not cost or fraud the question is what do we want from our society, one where it is dog eat dog and only the strong survive or one that we care for all? And before you say that you are one of the fit, you are not you are on Reddit, if you were one of the financial elite you would have better things to do with your time. Fraud is and always will be a red herring, a weapon of mass distraction, yes is happens but as such a low level it is eclipsed by simple errors by the civil service.

Pubs / Bars (Yellow) 

Castle Arms at East end of Royal Mile (check the terrace out the back door). 

Worlds' End pub, West end of Royal Mile.

The Waverly pub, West End of Royal Mile - not a general reccomendation for tourists, but kind of kooky in a way some Redditor's might appreciate.

Brew Dog pub, along Cowgate. Probably one of the most prominent (getting a bit hipster) craft breweries. Note though that this area is where people go to get pissed, especially stag/hen nights and other groups visiting the city, so I'd suggest this be on the agenda for afternoon/evening rather than night time.

Guilford Arms, a nice Scottish pub conveniently near Waverly train station.

Cafe Royal bar has been there for some 150 years and retains the original Victorian-Baroque style.

* Ditch the drop shadows. It looks tacky. At the very least, make it more subtle. Drop the opacity, increase the size, but lower the distance. It seems like you might be going for the ""Paper Cutout"" style, in which case a drop shadow would be fine, but it should be a bit more realistic.

* The font and styling of ""Doctor Who"" should be changed.  ""Who"" should have a capital ""W"". I would go with something closer to the logo, but if you want to be original and do something different, at least be creative with it.  You are using a font that just comes on all computers.  Check out some free fonts online ([dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com) is great), and get playful. I would also remove the white stroke around the font and try to find a better way to make the logo stand out. Just a plain stroke around something usually isn't enough to make it look nice. If anything a plain stroke will make your work very ameuter. 

* Just a personal preference, but I would avoid using pitch black for the TARDIS color and instead make it just a tad lighter. When I am designing and need to do a dark/black icon or silhouette, I find using something not completely black looks much better.  Try making the TARDIS more like #1D1D1D.

* Be mindful of the layout.  I would squeeze in the logo just a bit so it's not as close to the sides and the top. Having some nice margins around the edges will help give it a more clean look.

* Figure out what you are using the background texture for. Is it just to give it some depth/texture? Be creative in how you use the background. As it is, it's a bit bland, if you are going for the ""Paper Cutout"" style, maybe play with the idea of some imperfections in the paper. A rip, a stain, another element on the paper.

* When in doubt, throw on a light, subtle vignette, they can class up any design in a snap.

* I like the version without the Doctor. We never see the Doctor through the windows, so it's a bit strange to see it in this version.

Tax cut – look at North Sea oil and the differences between Norway and the UK. They invested in the people we gave tax cuts. But mainly for the top earners.  

And yes, I do think that some consider the majority as nothing more than a resource to be farmed, if you disagree go back and read the newspapers for the last year. Tax cuts for the rich have happened as we are all in this together, the top 1 000 have gained £155 000 000 000 in the last two years.

First I do not hate anyone, I dislike. I doubt this will do any good (or will be read) but this is a brief of my worldview. 

The principles of modern conservative thought are rooted in the concepts that emerged in the 18th and 19th century. Many of the concepts are about the right of the individual to trade without restrictions (read An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations available online if you look) and as a reaction to the French revolution. The very word conservative gives this away, to conserve the function and fabric of society without change. The PM even clams descent from royalty.  I am an atheist so I do not consider that anyone has a divine right to rule, conservatism is just an expression of feudalism. 

Conservatives gain their wealth and power from the rich, originally this was a group that was granted lands by the royal family.  So it is to conserve a structure that allows trade and tradition values, from the French revolution onwards there has been a gradual erosion of these powers in fact in the 1830s a English revolution was considered a strong possibility. In the 19th century riots occurred across England to protest about the suffering of the populous, riot in this context means, for example, a ship full of flour being seized and the flour being sold in the market for a fair price and the money being given to the captain, very English.

The liberals looked from 1880 onwards at the German rise for national efficiency, and remember we were in an arms race with them at the time, so the liberal reforms where not about helping the common man but to create an efficient society to compete with the rest of the world. 

Unfortunately the rise in industrialisation lead to less dispersal of the working class and more education. So people started to talk and question, even after being tried for treason for just questioning the state. 
This led to the rise of the labour party but it has a fundamental flaw, is it not a party of the people it is a capitalist workers party, in order to function and grow it requires that the unions fund it so accepts a  social structure that you have workers and rulers. 

Capitalism is a Ponzi scheme, smith's invisible hand and everything else belies that fact that for the most part that in order to produce you must be the producer. Capitalism relies on the concept of a growing market, the only way you can have a continually growing market is though having infinite resources. We have one planet last time I looked.  

How is the value of anything determined today? It is not down to the materials it uses but on the perception of the value of the item, from IPhone to Facebook it is not the item but the perception, if you have never heard of the “south sea bubble” go Google.  

As a nation our value come from our credit rating, nothing else. So the rating agencies that in collusion with banks fixed the financial markets so a few individuals walked away with billions got away with it as to call them out would of resulted in a financial mutually assured destruction. 

Now this is the bit people do not get, money is meaningless. It is a concept, a belief system. Beyond a token to convey value it has no purpose. To trade in the supposed value of an illusion is to give credence to a lie, it is no more than Jesus on toast. The Emperor has no clothes.   

This is how I view the world around me we live a life that unless you are one of the very few that need to be conserved you are an object that has no more value that its ability to produce an illusionary concept to contribute to an illusionary system in order to gain status in an illusionary society. 

The only way you get to be the few is if you are born to it or are very, very lucky.

Yes at this point you should look at your Karma and bank balance and think oh shit. 

I do not want this I want a world that we all get a chance, I want a world that our value does not depend on a credit rating constructed by a morally deficient  moron but what I contribute to society. And by society I mean people not karma. 

So I consider we are trapped in a system that is just wrong, and now people will go but…. 

Before you do look at locus of control, obedience, conformity and social mobility. We are built to follow the herd, but by design or by ill fortune we are all doomed unless we stop, think and act. 

So we are just doomed.

You are right to say that fraud is so low with DLA; but that's partly because it's not a means-tested benefit so the possibility of actual ""fraud"" is quite low. (ie, there are less possible routes for fraud to be undertaken in with the DLA than other benefits)

I think the nominal goal of this particular set of cuts is to perhaps try and stop people who have alot of money from claiming, with the logic being that only those who cannot afford to provide themselves with various mobility and living costs themselves ought to be given money. ( an explanation of the government line that was somewhat lacking from the New Statesman article in the post above)

**Which is not to say I agree with that logic**, simply that this is the logic that the government will be operating under.

I personally take great pride in the fact that those unable to look after themselves are so well looked after in this country, and I'm greatly worried that some very needing people will be hung out to dry, and have their quality of life greatly diminished if these cuts go wrong (which they probably will if fucking atos is running the show).

Christ knows what my grandparents would do without their DLA and motability car; frankly I was financially crippled and felt wretched due to barely being able to do anything when my leg was in a cast for a month or two. That very brief experience obviously doesn't give me a whole heap of experience to draw upon, but I can definitely sympathise with people who suddenly will have their DLA taken away; being in a position to need that support in the first place and losing it . . . it's not a good place to be

true,[deleted],null,null,"Depends. Probably a bit of both and I think we would have to cater to the opposition. I like having a defensive winger it gives us strength and flexibility so were not all Arsenal all the time. Also depends on if RDM stays. 

I think Ramires can play in a two-man midfield, but its not his strongest position. If he works hard enough on his lateral passing then we could put him in there and put a more attacking player on the wing when we need. 

As far as De Bruyne goes... here are my gut feelings, which aren't based on much as everything is in the dark right now...I think his best position is going to be in midfield. Ideally, if this were a few years in the future I'd imagine KDB in that midfield role that I left blank. Despite him playing a lot on the wing he reminds me a lot of Lampard and Gerrard. I also think he will go on loan next year sadly, but it will be to a good team. To either Eredevise, Ligue 1 or La Liga. When he comes back we will have to see what we need.

I see Marin as a depth player. You could probably interchange him with Rammers in that lineup for a bunch of games. He will play against certain types of teams, he might come off the bench, and because he can play on the left, right, and center, he's a great asset to have in case of injuries. Nothing wrong with depth players. Were in desperate need of them.

the older arrangments, from 1963-1980 (minus that one weird pertwee version), all had this dark, moody, and mysterious quality about them, which got destroyed in the 1980s with new synth-heavy arrangments.

these new, post-2005 arrangements seem to take things further in that direction. gone is the creepy, ""you're flying all alone in the middle of an unknown vortex"" feel.  now it's all about bombast--loud, thick arrangements, with each instrument or section competing with the others to be heard--which isn't nearly as cool, in my opinion.  

plus, the latest versions all have different chord progressions beneath the signature melody, which i find to be more of a distraction than anything.

Eccleston came into Doctor Who at the most difficult time. Filming the first season was a lot of hard work filled with nightshoots. He was in almost every scene so that made it near impossible for him to do anything else. By the time the first season was to air, with no certainty of it being a succes or not, Eccleston decided to leave the tardis for someone else. Eccleston also wasn't a Whovian. Up until getting the part he had never seen the show. He did end up auditioning purely because a good friend of his, RTD, was the lead writer. I think that is something he regretted. He did not gain anything from it, his carreer didn't get a boost because of it. 

Yet I think it is important to remember that without him, we wouldn't have Doctor Who. On #9 returnig: I just think he doesn't see the point. I heard an interview with him about it, and despite speaking fondly about Doctor Who, he doesn't understand the scale of it. He basically said that he wouldn't return because someone else is playing the role now. Which makes me think that the BBC itself has to go out and give him an offer before we got a definitive answer.

additionally, i'm not certain how long you've been on this earth, but bombast is nothing new to science fiction.  *star wars,* both musically and cinematically, is far more bombastic than any era of *doctor who*, *firefly* or any era of *star trek*.   about the only piece of music from the first three movies that doesn't blow brass in your face the whole time is leia's theme.  everything else is about layering as many strings and horns as would fit into john williams studio. 

bombast is, in fact, a fairly familiar and worn out musical trope in science fiction cinema that goes back to at least the mid 1960s, which is why *doctor who*'s theme from that period was so refreshingly different, although the theme itself was almost certainly a throwback to the more sparsely arranged, theramin-influenced sci-fi themes of the 1950s (though even many of those had their share of big brass swells and banging timpanis).

The Wikipedia article on the subject is worth a read ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You ). It seems the song was composed in the 1890s, in a school, and then somehow got registered by a company which produced songbooks in the 1930s. That copyright is then what is owned by Warner Chappell (who enforce it to around $5000 a day). There are some suggestions, though, that it was never in copyright in the US, or, at least, isn't now (Wikipedia links to a paper discussing it, which was unable to come to any conclusions). The US copyright (if it exists) is set to expire in the 2030s.

In the EU, it will be in copyright until 2016 (unless the law is changed first, or subsequently), however, from the evidence available, it seems that none of that $5,000 a day has ever made it back to the original composers.

Happy Birthday is a good example of how flawed the copyright laws are, as it is illegal to sing (in public) a song, composed for school children about 120 years ago, that is so steeped in our culture, without a licence from a random US company that happened to buy something they thought was the copyright.

Interestingly, now I've done some digging (while writing this), it looks like copyrights existing prior to 1995 (when copyright was extended) mostly kept their old duration, which means the song should have come out of copyright in the UK on 1st January 1996...

The Daleks have, over the season, created a plan to 'steal' the planet and use it for their nefarious schemes of conquering the universe.  By the end, The Doctor finds himself separated from his friends and companions, and utterly defeated(Again, very similar to Journey's End). The initial plan was to use a massive bomb to destroy the Dalek fleet, but it failed, and it was now with his companion. He managed to get visual and audio of his companion, but she only had visual of him. She asks him, in a very Doctor Who fashion, what the plan is. That if there is any way out of this, any way at all, just give her a sign. A wink, a nudge, a smile, anything. Something to tell her that he knows of another way out other than her detonating the bomb, and sacrificing herself. He knows there's no other way to save the Earth, and all he can do is look on at her, and do nothing. She then turns around, and without hesitation, detonates the bomb destroying the Dalek fleet. What follows is one of the saddest moments in Who history. Even to the point in which he tells Susan, his grandaughter, that she better follow him back to the TARDIS, because he might do something stupid if she doesn't. And he threatens going back, throwing away all laws of time travel, and killing the Dalek that caused all of the bad things to happen, just so he could save his companion. He ultimately goes off alone, listening to a recording she had made for him. Words can't express how deepning and sad this moment was for me.

No imagination...just latch onto something people find spooky like ugly dolls and you have a script!  I hear he's been creeping around Reddit's ""nope"" posts and plans to use giant spiders next time.

Gatiss does this all the time. He doesn't come up with original ideas or characters.  He uses things that he seems to think people will praise him for.

For example, there was no point in using Charles Dickens in that 9 episode.  Any old victorian dude could have been used.  Good ol Charlie had no reason for being there other than a sort of ""product"" placement.  He was something recognizable and thats it.

And then of course his endings are atrocious, ""deux ex machina"", pieces of garbage.  Charlie dickens saves the day where a 900 year old gallifreyan could not.  The same gallifreyan who was able to grab Calufrax without destroying a pirate planet from massive gravitational instabilities, or who outwitted an egyptian GOD, the master, Rassilon himself, etc.  Who saves everyone from the dollhouse?  The alien boy who had no character development at all and whom we hardly know anything about.

We see the same theme time and time again:  The doctor shoots from the hip with no plan, and shows that compassion and intelligence will win in the end.  In Gatiss's episodes, the Doctor is suddenly an idiot who has no power...or the episode's storyline is just rediculously stupid to begin with.

In addition, I have heard rumors that he is grooming his son to take over Chelsea when Roman feels it's too much work. I really don't think there is anything to worry about. Roman sounds like he is in it for the long haul.

Roman isn't Sheik Moneybags over at Man City. He shows up to almost every game he can and celebrates like a true fan after every goal. If he stops showing up for games or he starts disappearing into his private box to do business as opposed to watching the game then it's time to worry, but as long as we keep seeing [this](http://gifs.gifbin.com/042010/1272535664_roman-abramovich-is-happy.gif) there should be nothing to worry about.

Edit: I'd like to add that with Financial Fair Play looming it is going to be harder for Roman (and all other owners) to invest his personal money into the club.

Even if Uncle Roman chose to sell the club, I highly doubt that sale would not include the stadium as well. There's really no reason for the CPO to worry at all. The reason that the Bridge was sold to the CPO in the first place was because Chelsea was really doing poorly financially and the owner at the time (blanking on his name, Bates maybe?) wanted to make sure that Chelsea wouldn't lose Stamford Bridge in a foreclosure type scenario if the club was bankrupted. Even if Roman decides to sell Chelsea, the price of the club is going to be so astronomical it would be pretty much rule out its purchase by a group that couldn't afford to support the team financially.

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"Unless I've missed something lately the CPO stuff really has nothing to do with worries that Roman is leaving. I don't keep that up to date with the CPO stuff as I'm a US fan, but here's my understanding of what is going on.

The board of directors and Roman and many of the fans feel that with FFP on the horizon and to go along with the new found success of our club a bigger stadium is needed (Bigger stadium = more money). We can't expand Stamford Bridge any more because it is boxed in on all sites so if we do decide on expansion it will have to be at a new location. Years ago when Chelsea was in financial trouble shares of the stadium were sold to generate money (I believe there was another reason too, something about keeping the club from going under, but don't quote me on that. I'm doing this from memory.) Anyway the CPO is comprised of people who then bought or have since come into ownership of those shares. They own the stadium basically in the same way shareholders of a company own the company. I have also head it claimed that somehow the CPO has the rights to the name ""Chelsea FC"", I believe they are tied to the stadium.

The problem right now is that the owners of the club want a new stadium and need the rights to the old stadium so they can sell the land to help pay for the new stadium. Theoretically, Roman could just build a new stadium and move all the players and staff, but he would no longer be able to call the team Chelsea FC and have to 100% pay for the new stadium. Roman and the club would rather not do this so they are trying to buy out the CPO, but currently the CPO feel they aren't being given a fair deal and are holding out for more.

If someone who knows more can point out mistakes in what I've said that would be fantastic, but that is what is going on there as far as I'm concerned.

My point is the CPO have no real control over Roman's actions. They have a pretty big bargaining chip, but Roman tends to do what he pleases. Really there is nothing to worry about, at least not short term. Roman wants to turn Chelsea into a world wide club like Man U or Barca, if he does that we won't need his money nearly as much. He bought this club because he loves the game, not because of the current fad among the super wealthy is to buy a sports team.

Also: He didn't fire Ancelotti because he came in second or failed to win the CL. This is a very common misconception that gets brought up by people who support other clubs to make Roman seem like and insane perfectionist (although some times he is). Ancelotti was removed because he was happy to play the same old system that we had been playing since Jose was in charge. Roman wanted us to play differently, but you don't fix something that ain't broke. He only got a second season because he won the title, he didn't get fired because he didn't win it.",0,1337067541,null,0,false,0,c4o7sv9,t3_tnlsk,t1_c4o7sv9,t1_c4o79fv,null,1428928020,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I'm saying that, in that context, he's fairly replaceable. The UK isn't without its selection of actors, and I'm sure at least a handful of top tiered British actors wouldn't mind having a role as The Doctor.

So, in a sense, I'm completely agreeing with you. He helped grab traction for the show, get people like Tennant and the BBC interested, etc. However, I just don't feel like those are properties that are wholly unique to him.

I think a lot more credit should go to the three I mentioned.

Tennant for being an actor that many people identified with, and really got into. The majority of people in the new era started off with Tennant, and I think a large part of people becoming Whovians was due to his likability as an actor(Hell, look at how many people *still* want him back in the role). And, finally, Moffat for creating episodes like Blink and Empty Child that truly captivated audiences into watching Doctor Who(Again, if Tennant was a lot of people's first Doctor, Blink was quite often their first episode).

I think, more so than Eccleston, if it hadn't been for those three then the series wouldn't have lasted as well as it did.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"The problem with giving people more personal 'power' is that there will always be a minority that abuse it - you know, the setup where you invite someone into your house, then shoot them saying they were a burglar. Anything you authorise the public to carry (knives, tasers, etc.) can then be used by the criminal element too. I can imagine muggers using tazers to guarantee the victim doesn't fight back, for instance - they use knives already, which is why if you're found to be carrying one, you have to explain exactly why you need it (which to my mind, when in a city or suburb, is fair enough).

Security Cameras do displace crime, but I'd argue they also reduce it by removing the opportunistic element in areas where there will be a lot more people/ targets (like on train stations). As a result, my Wife can use the tube or walk down a high street late at night - something that was inadvisable in quite a few areas not so many years ago.

Needless to say, the union was packed with Chelsea fans and people who wanted to see Chelsea lose. I usually watch football with my dad so since I've been away at Uni he's been texting me intently when Chelsea play.

 So the game starts and I'm feeling very nervous after both the goals go in and Terry gets sent off, I'm feeling embarrassed and upset. I was reviving loads of texts from my friends say oh no, bad luck and what not and I thought it was all over and felt like going back to my halls. then out of nowhere I wasn't paying attention and my friend nudged me and suddenly I saw Ramires beautifully chip Valdes and I realised that we could win this one!

Fast forward to the second half and I was feeling confident, I somehow knew Messi would miss his penalty, not sure why. Anyway, after seeing some amazing defending and seeing Drogba defending on the left flank I thought that would be that, then Torres happened. My Liverpool fan friends we're containing their laughter and a few people around the union were jeering, laughing and what not.

Then it came for that amazing moment, I think I will remember it for the rest of my life. The point at which Torres touched it down and advanced toward the goal made me subconsciously stand up. My mind flicked back to the United miss and I was feeling a little uneasy but as he slipped it round Valdes everyone in the whole union, regardless of what team they supported stood up and started cheering, it was quite a sight to behold, the celebrations were lasting for at least 20 minutes and way past the final whistle. The most astonishing thing about that goal was that the Liverpool fans I was with were both cheering as if they were a Chelsea fan their whole life and considering they both dislike Torres, it was quite a rarity.

The Globe is part of the New York Times, who are shareholders in NESV via an independent investment fund. So the link is:

Seeing how famous Sulzberger is about independence at the NYT company where even within the single building the business management and editorial are completely separate, I really really doubt that NESV have any sway over anybody at The Globe.

It is just good public relations or poor reporting, if it is a backdoor relationship then it would mean that hundreds of others have influence over the New York Times and The Globe, because of how interconnected the business relationships are, but we know that is not true.

There have been many cases where the NYT has written negative stories about their own shareholders, board members, former editors, etc. so I really doubt a 4th degree connection can influence much.

I can sympathize with you since media ownership in the USA is so messed up, but surely the world largest newspaper based in New York would have no trouble publishing stories critical of the Red Sox?

I come back down, and Lampard threads a beautiful ball through to Ramires. Surely not, we have ten men, how could this be? The most exquisite chip floats into the back of the Barcelona net, and somehow, at this point, it's US who are going through to the final. At half time, I was silent.

Moving into the second half, I could see Barcelona were clearly dominating. Drogba performs his duties as emergency left back, but, what is this, a penalty? Messi? I was oddly confident. I hate watching penalties, but for this one, there was no way Messi could score. And he didn't disappoint me.

&gt;A friend of mine who suffers from paralysis from the waist down and is confined to a wheel chair was asked to prove he couldn't walk when he went to claim what money is owe to him, you think that's suitable behaviour for job centre staff?

Yes. You will find that many people do need to supply proof of illness/disability/pregnancy before having taxpayer money given to them. That's like complaining that your 65 year old grandmother was asked to show ID buying alcohol when the policy is that everyone must show ID to prove their age.

I highly doubt your friend is faking it judging by your anger, but it has been known. Hey, I'm in a wheelchair - pay me.

&gt;&gt;I wonder if people think taxpayer money is better spent on a adviser for society's vulnerable or a dedicated job searcher for walk-in customers?
&gt;
&gt;I think it's lucky we budget for both, don't you?
&gt;

Well that's the thing - they don't. It's a fact - fewer staff to do the same/more work means that you have to cut back on some things...

The fact is - the Jobcentre can no longer be the 'free' job agency. It has to concentrate on the benefits side and preparing people for a basic level of employability.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"We heard about this announcement last night, it was widely assumed to be something positive, nobody thought they'd release news like this a few days before the biggest game in club history

Sunny Hwang has given some very unsubtle hints both to Bloomberg and the native South Korean media that Samsung will not be looking to renew the current £14M a season deal with Chelsea should we fail to win the Champions League, thus missing out on the competition next season

This news does not come totally out of the blue (no pun intended), though the timing has caught everyone by surprise. Chelsea lag behind many clubs when it comes to sponsorship revenue and the looming Financial Fair Play rules means everyone needs to extract as much revenue as possible from every source. I've heard whispers about Samsung being wary of increasing their deal by the 50% or so it would take to catch market leaders. Their massive success in the past few years has strengthened their bargaining position, while our poor domestic season has weakened ours

Samsung is also unwilling to sponsor Stamford Bridge or lend their name to any new stadium. This is seen as an important step in the development at Battersea, in particular, as the roughly £20M per annum from stadium naming rights would be a huge addition to revenue streams, in addition to an estimated £30M per annum in increased matchday revenue

Over the past few months Ron Gourlay has had several meetings with the Qatari Royal Family. It has been acknowledged that the purpose of this was not to negotiate a sale of the club (Roman does not want to sell) but to investigate a commercial partnership. Qatar Investment Authority holds a majority stake in Paris Saint-Germain, as well as being linked to a takeover at Man United. The election victory of Hollande in France has raised concern over their continued investment in PSG, as one of his main policies is a 75% top rate of tax, which would cripple Ligue 1. Rumours abound that QIA is looking to take over the shirt sponsorship, take up naming rights to a new stadium and help finance the development in exchange for equity/holdings in the surrounding construction, albeit not the club itself (not possible until they sell their stake in PSG)

A belief held by some I've spoken to is that QIA is looking to put itself in prime position should Roman decide to sell the club in the future, something I feel is very unlikely within the next 10 years. The Qatari Royal Family has made real estate acquisitions in the area over the past few years, they were behind the purchase of Chelsea Barracks for £959M a few years ago",0,1337085585,null,0,false,0,c4o9bze,t3_to3py,t1_c4o9bze,t3_to3py,null,1428928740,14,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,14

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Yes. You will find that many people do need to supply proof of illness/disability/pregnancy before having taxpayer money given to them. That's like complaining that your 65 year old grandmother was asked to show ID buying alcohol when the policy is that everyone must show ID to prove their age.

Which is a valid reason to complain.
If you're 65, you're clearly visible older than 18, what's the point of asking for ID? 

In the same respect, if you're **IN** a Job Centre, in a wheel chair, and they have record of your medical condition, why would you ask someone to *prove* that disability? 

(Bearing in mind you are asking someone who can not walk, to prove they can not walk, I'm not simply saying they asked for medical records, they already had these as he'd been on disability allowance for a year or so.)

It's purposefully being difficult for the sake of it, just because it's in the ""rules"" doesn't make it acceptable. 

&gt;The fact is - the Jobcentre can no longer be the 'free' job agency. It has to concentrate on the benefits side and preparing people for a basic level of employability.

true,abowsh,1986,Oscar,"I had a client conference call during the middle of this match. I was able to watch the first 25 minutes through an online stream on my work computer before starting the client call. As I am on the call, I am constantly switching back and forth between spreadsheets and the game. Because of this, I completely miss large segments of the game.

I did not see Terry go off. I did not see the goals to put Chelsea down. However, I managed to open that tab just in time to see Ramires score at the end of the first half. Even at this point, I'm realizing that we are down a goal and a man to the best team in the world. I still had hope, but it was fading.

As the second half progressed, I couldn't manage to get off this call with a client. We had nothing to talk about, she was just going on and on about previous projects that had nothing to do with current work. I'm doing everything I can to get her to shut up so I can leave the office and watch the final minutes at my local soccer pub. It didn't work. I was on the phone with her for nearly the entire game.

As the final minutes ticked away. I've completed ignored the client. I've closed out my spreadsheets and am watching the match as attentively as possible. 

As Barca is pummeling out defense with shot after shot, I'm starting to feel more dejected. How can we score a goal if we cant even get it out of our own half?!? Then it happens...Frank makes a wonderful pass downfield. Due to the fact that I didn't have audio, I wasn't sure where the pass was going. I didn't know Torres was there. I thought he was just clearing the ball. But out of nowhere...I see Fernando streaking down the left side of the pitch, uncovered, running full speed with only the keeper to beat.

At this moment, I'm having flashbacks. I'm thinking back to the Manchester United game. Is this the Torres that we have and will always have? The Torres that doesn't quite have ""it"" anymore.

I have completely forgotten about my client. I ignored her and am screaming ""GO, GO, GO GO!!!"" as loud as I can. Half of my office is looking over at me wondering what the hell I am doing.

Then, almost as if it happened in slow motion. Torres makes that little flick on the ball and shakes free of the keeper. I can't even speak anymore. The only thing coming from my mouth was a series of gargles and screams as El Nino puts it in the back of the net.

I go crazy for about 5 seconds before I realize that I am still on speaker phone with a client. I can barely hear her because of my screaming asking ""is everything okay?"" Trying to hold back my excitement, I come back to the phone and can barely put together a sentence. I pretty much end the call at this point because I couldn't talk.

Less than a minute after, I run to the roof of our office and scream until my lungs hurt. I couldn't watch the game with my fellow Chelsea fans, but the entire east-side of my town was aware that something great happened.

Luckily, the final is a Saturday. No client calls, no office. I will be at my local pub getting ready for what I hope to be the greatest moment in Chelsea history. I cant wait!",0,1337087825,null,0,false,0,c4o9lni,t3_tnvss,t1_c4o9lni,t3_tnvss,null,1428928866,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Breaking news;

What Culture understands from its US-based sources that Kenny Dalglish has resigned as Liverpool manager today.

Dalglish and assistant manager Steve Clarke was scheduled to meet the Liverpool board Stateside this morning, including US owner John Henry and chairman Tom Werner, and we believe Dalglish’s offer of resignation has been accepted with immediate effect. The Anfield legend leaves his post after just 18 months in charge and despite delivering a League Cup trophy (their first silverware in six years) and another Wembley final in the FA Cup defeat to Chelsea, Liverpool finished eighth this season after 17 league defeats, finishing 17 points behind the Champions League places and 40 points behind the top two.

During his spell in charge Dalglish had spent £114 million with the generous warchest partly funded by Fernando Torres’ £50 million sale to Chelsea but also out of the US owners desire to get back into the Champions League. But they were so off the mark this season that their Champions League wish was over months before this past Sunday’s finale when they lost again without a whimper, 1-0 at Swansea.

Liverpool FC are refusing to comment on the situation but we understand that an official announcement is expected at around 3.30pm UK time.

British newspapers reported over the weekend that US owner John Henry was eyeing Wigan manager Roberto Martinez to replace Dalglish after his impressive style of football has kept the Latics in the Premier Division for another season.

If your employer demands that you have to ask for certain things regardless of the apparent evidence in front of, there are no two ways about it - you have to ask or you face disciplinary action. This goes for the hardened civil servant asking for obvious proof, or the pimply teenager in Tesco unable to process the Smirnoff for Ethel because they could get sacked if a manager is watching. With the former it cuts down on fraud (maybe a sledgehammer to open a walnut, but still). With the latter it means Tesco don't get a fine for serving a minor and cut into their huge profits.

If you are standing in the queue arguing about the policy and how ridiculous it is, you are just going to end up as an anecdote on [Not Always Right](http://www.notalwaysright.com) and sniggered at by other customers.

Also, there may well be a rebrand at some point. No doubt The Sun will be up in arms about ""OUR"" money being used to change millions of signs, marquees, leaflets, forms, logos, name badges etc. Some bright spark will chip in on the letters page with ""so it took x million to come up with the name y, I could have done that for a pint, lol"" and nothing actually changes .

You can still find jobs there, if you are actually registered as a signer you may be lucky to get a quick jobsearch when the queue isn't out the door, you still get local and national companies doing recruitment drives working with the Jobcentre. However, there are not the resources to hold everybody's hand, just the ones that need the real help.

People who are reckless at 17 are unlikely to have changed their driving habits by the age of 18. It's often several years of driving experience that teaches you that.

Also age isn't really a huge factor in my opinion, there are many 16 year old's who are mature enough to take control of a car.

The key in my opinion is driver training. It needs to be more extensive, cover a range of driving conditions, night and day, wet and dry. It needs to include emergency manoeuvres on protected courses, where drivers can safely practise evasive action.

Right now, you can pass your test without ever being put in a situation that would require you to react. Your first real test is when you suddenly need to swerve on the motorway to avoid a hazard. If you fail you could end up dead. Why aren't we teaching people how to drive PROPERLY before they go out on the road alone?

I say, drastically change the test procedures, less significance on knowing the difference between red, green and blue cat-eyes and more significance on car control, high speed manoeuvres, learning how a car handles in a variety of situations.",0,1337090077,null,0,false,0,c4o9xa2,t3_to4et,t1_c4o9xa2,t1_c4o9e7k,null,1428929019,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Has anyone ever told Gatiss that people need HOLES in their faces (otherwise known as noses, and mouths) to breathe?  I mean how else will they live one their faces are deleted.

Say those last few words aloud a couple times and then tell me it was a good episode: 

**FACES ARE DELETED**

How about a nifty little equation that this guy named Einstein came up with: E=MC^2 ?  If you have the ability to convert yourself into an energy being, don't you think you'd have the ability to convert BACK?  And think about this for a minute: The Wire needs to steal neural energy....so what the flying fuck does losing your FACE have to do with that????


How about we talk about recycled plots?:

Unquiet Dead (Gatiss' previous episode) has a gas based villain, Idiots Lantern has an energy based villain; both incorporeal. Unquiet Dead has a character that is a cliche' male aggressive, conservative character (Gabriel Sneed, the funeral director) as does Idiot's Lantern with Eddie Foreman. Unquiet Dead has a protagonist that is oppressed by the aforementioned male aggressive character, the female psychic character of Gwyneth, as does Idiots Lantern with the Tommy Foreman character.  I swear that Gatiss has some sort of [Script Generator](http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/trek/gen.html) as his work is just hollow and spiritless.

Lets talk betamax.  Yeah, a timelord uses Betamax.  The only problem here is that Betamax wasn't developed by Sony until 1975, 22 years later. 

Then again, instead of just going into the TARDIS and grabbing a Betamax tape, why not grab something a little more useful, like nothing. It's obvious that if you are absorbing an electrically energy based organism that you intend to kill, why record its energy signature onto a tape?  You could just DELETE it by scattering/randomizing the signature.


**P.S. David Tennant's acting skills have nothing to do with Gatiss' writing skills.  David Tennant has the skill to make dialogue from Twilight look decent.**


EDIT:  Only a douche downvotes because they don't like the answer.  I stayed on topic.  But if it really makes you feel more like a man, knock yourself out.

true,[deleted],null,null,"For the vast majority of it, the most uncomfortable, stressful and nervous I had ever been in my entire life. It felt so surreal - almost exactly like I was dreaming. I had a feeling, even when it was 2-0 and we were down to 10, that something awesome might happen and I'm normally the most ridiculous pessimist. I had a feeling that Messi would miss the penalty.

It's pretty hard to describe. You're so far away from the action (although I felt that the extent to which you can't see anything is massively overstated) that it feels that you're watching a video game or something. Bizarre.

Anyway, for the entire second half it was just so hard to watch. Having the view we had (the end that Torres scored) it was ridiculous. Barcelona literally had Valdes in their own half and that was it. Every single one of our players was in our area (or thereabouts) and every one of theirs was a maximum of 35-40 yards out.

But I'm sure what you want to know about was the moment when Torres broke free. As you know, he tried to dribble out and lost it. In fact we were way less solid when he came on because he wasn't tracking back at all. It was infuriating. When he lost it and ran another 10 yards up field pretty much everyone was screaming at the fucker to get back. He hasn't exactly had the luckiest time with us, but as luck would have it Ashley Cole hoofed it up to him and obviously from our view we could see that he was in right away (unlike TV where it only showed him from about the halfway line onwards). Watching it back, he takes about 10-15 seconds (if that) to get to Valdes, but up there it honestly felt like about 45. When he took it round Valdes I was thinking, ""Man Utd please no, Man Utd please no, fucking hell not like Old Trafford. PLEASE"" or something like that - I'm not very articulate when I think! So when he slotted it in I cannot describe just how utterly insane everyone went. There are plenty of videos but I don't think they do it justice - people were falling down rows, jumping all over eachother. Bloke who was standing behind me ended up three rows in front I think. It was pandemonium. But it was quite honestly one of the best feelings I've ever had in my life.

Full time wasn't much different. Everyone kept singing until we were let out (which was bloody ages - TV seemed to imply that we were there out of choice, we weren't, but tbh, I would have stayed for a while anyway) and maybe five minutes after full time (and I'm aware that it sounds super gay) I was welling up. Sad, I know. 

We were let out eventually and we chaperoned by the hardest looking police in Spain (seriously, they're scary fuckers) to the nearest Metro station.

&gt;DWM: Following this autumn's five episodes, the Christmas Special will then see a new companion join the Doctor, in the shape of Jenna-Louise Coleman. How does Steven approach writing for a new companion? In DWM 397 said that all the companions (I think this is limited to people who went willingly travelling with him full-time else this doesn't make sense, which is a fair use of the word companion I suppose) other than Donna and perhaps Leela, are 'identical'.
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: Ha! Did I? Well, they are a bit.
&gt;
&gt;DWM: So how do you make the next one distinctive?
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: Well, I think I'll answer you in the show. I'll answer you in the show about how it's going to be different, because it is going to be different.  It’s going to be a shock, I think. In terms of the companions all being ‘the same’ - that’s not as phony or artistically crap a thing to say as it sounds. What is the base group of people who would run away with the Doctor? They're all going to be...
&gt;
&gt;DWM: A bit mad.
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: A bit mad yes. A bit dislocated. Not happy with where they are. Are they yearning for outer space? They’re going to be people who feel like they can take on the Doctor, who’s quite an intimidating sort of person. So, they’re going to be feisty - they’re going to be all those things. He sort of defines the people who are going to travel with him. The distinction comes very much from the various actors and actresses. So, you know, they’re the ones who create the differences between them. But you are always going to have the same sort of person, just because it’s the same man choosing them, and it’s the same person being chosen.
&gt;
&gt;DWM: And they need to fulfil the same function in the programme?
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: Well, it's not even a function in the programme, I think it's less of that. I think the function of the companion is pretty simple. I don't think that's very difficult. It’s just a question of who credibly is going to agree to go in the TARDIS? Who’s going to do it? Is it going to be a mother of 15 children? No. Is it going to be someone in their 60s? No. Is there going to be a particular age range? I mean... who’s going to have a crush on the Doctor? You know, come on! 
&gt;
&gt;DWM: That's the format of the series after all.Moffat: It’s more than a format. It’s evolved from good, dramatic reasons.
&gt;
&gt;DWM: Let's face it, Doctor Who isn't the only show in the world to have one male and one female as its lead characters.
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: It's not just us, no! [laughs] That's why Sherlock gets two male leads, but it's a different kind of thing. If you knew someone in real life like the Doctor - who, I don't know had a boat that he ran away on and was massively charismatic, a bit older, a bit bonkers...would you expect him to have a young girl with in tow? I mean, you probably would. She probably would be going with him. It's probably not going to be a middle-aged shop assistant. It's probably not going to be a 60-year-old banker.
&gt;
&gt;DWM: Donna Noble was a bit of an exception, wasn't she? She was a 40-year-old office worker.
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: I think that worked brilliantly, but it is a purposely-created alternative to normal. The Doctor even says 'You're a bit older than what I normally get.' He says it in The Runaway Bride...
&gt;
&gt;DWM: Well, Donna was created as a one-off character...
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: Absolutely.
&gt;
&gt;DWM: ...And a year later, he doesn't invite Mr. Cropper to travel with him.
&gt;
&gt;Moffat: Well, I don't believe Mr. Cropper would go. I don't believe I'd go! If he stopped here now, I don't think I'd go with him, I'd say 'It's far too bloody dangerous, I've got a life, I'm not leaving, I'm busy!' The big question is 'Who is going to go?' - and I think that defines, not people who are all the same, but people with considerable elements of their personality. Also,  I think responsibly, he doesn't want to take someone away from a life that's ongoing. He's happy to take them away to be the equivalent of your gap year. But he doesn't want to be anything more than that, does he? ",0,1337094303,null,0,false,0,c4oant3,t3_tmvu6,t1_c4oant3,t3_tmvu6,null,1428929367,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"The copyright equivalent of ""prior art"" is a ""derivative work."" Copyright only protects ""original"" musical works, so if a new work is too close to an older one, it will only be protected by the older one's copyright.

&gt;In this case, it's likely that the original authors (apparently Preston Ware Orem and Mrs. R.R. Forman; the 1890s school claim referrs to the ""Good Morning to All"" melody only) submitted their song to a company producing a book of children's songs.

It's a little more complicated than that; in fact, there's a [2010 paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1111624) by a law professor which examines the history of the song and its copyright, 
and concludes that it is almost certainly out of copyright for various complex reasons, not least being that there's very little evidence that Patty and Mildred Hill (who wrote ""Good Morning to All"") also wrote the Happy Birthday lyrics - which were registered for copyright in 1935 by the Summy Company, by Orem and Forman, but had been published as early as 1912 by others.

The history of ownership of the copyright is well documented from the 1935 publication/registration, but there is still that rather crucial 40-year gap between the publication of Good Morning (in 1893) and then.

Also, under English law, it is for the copyright owners to prove the copyright was legitimately transferred, and legitimately assigned etc., not a defendant - and given Warner Chappell would seriously struggle to do that, the chance of it ever getting to a court is small.",0,1337094372,null,0,false,0,c4oao9k,t3_tn64q,t1_c4oao9k,t1_c4o72mw,null,1428929372,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The extradition treaty works in such a manner that the US can extradite from the UK if both countries find that a criminal act has occurred, harmed Americans (or be in their jurisidiction) and UK prosecutors not wanting to go ahead with prosecution. Grounds for extradition in the O Dwyer case stand as it being found the he had committed a criminal act and that the UK prosecution service not having plans to prosecute for it.

**Next question is usually, ""But he didn't commit a criminal act: tv-links case""**

The tv-links case was different, tv-links was entirely unmoderated, they used automated systems in place that allowed user votes on things to moderate the content and remove dead links etc etc. O Dwyer did not, he directly controlled the content on his site in order to maintain quality. The judge found that this was enough to implicate him as having committed direct copyright infringement as opposed to the users being the ones committing it.

**What happens next?**

His appeal case is set for July 30. If the judge at his appeal finds the same thing the first judge found (likely) then his extradition will go ahead. This however has to be signed by the home secretary cunt face Theresa May. Given that she's an absolute fucking moron this is quite a possibility, however, given the high media attention the case has received and the negative view of our current government in general it's possible they might use it to turn some people towards seeing the government in a more positive light. ""Sticking it to the yanks"" would definitely resonate well with some people.

true,literallyoverthemoon,eccleston,Eccleston,"Firstly, it is important to (briefly) outline the mechanisms with which both machines achieve time travel.

When a Tardis is travelling through time, it is actually moving through the Time Vortex, entering and exiting at the desired destinations, and is not within normal spacetime.

The Delorean uses Flux Dispersal to instantaneously leave one designated time and arrive in another, while remaining stationary in space.

Now, it may appear reasonable that a Delorean travelling between two points in time while within a Tardis moving through the Time Vortex would arrive at spatial coordinates within the Vortex, but at temporal coordinates at which the Tardis has passed or is yet to reach.

However, normal laws of physics do not apply within the Time Vortex, and it exists outwith time itself, therefore it would not be possible to program into a DeLorean temporal coordinates with respect to the Time Vortex, as none exist within it. Similarly, it can be assumed that no spatial coordinates could exist within the Vortex.

Therefore the only reference frame within which a Delorean could traverse in this system is that of the Tardis itself.

Travel within the Tardis' own timeline would be possible, so long as certain problems do not present themselves. For instance, if sections of the Tardis were to be moved, duplicated, or even deleted, the DeLorean could arrive split between two or more sets of coordinates, within two or more simultaneously, or may not arrive at all. Successful traversal may also depend on the nature of the Tardis' timeline, and whether it is fixed or in Flux; if in flux, the DeLorean would be incapable of Flux dispersal. Alteration of wibbly, wobbly, timey, and/or wimey parameters/controls may be necessary.

Travel within a Tardis' timeline would only be possible while an external reference frame is unavailable, i.e. when within the Time vortex. Any attempt to reach 88mph while the Tardis/DeLorean system exists within a reference frame with both termporal and spatial coordinates outwith the Tardis interior, would result in the outcome mentioned at the start of this answer; arrival before or after the Tardis existed at designated temporal coordinates.

This does not however forbid the arrival of a Delorean within a Tardis which is not within the Time Vortex, as the reference frame during Flux Dispersal would remain that of the Tardis.

In conclusion, a DeLorean within a Tardis could travel along the reference frame of the Tardis' timeline, but only while the Tardis exists within the Time Vortex (outwith spacetime), and assuming certain conditions.

* Rafa is great but I'm not sure if you can go back to him... it would be strange.  I wouldn't be disappointed but I would be a little confused.

That being said, there **is** some smoke/fire now.

As with any big business, there's a little bit of politics going on between FSG/Dalglish, I'm sure. FSG can always ""re-organize"" the structure of the front office (possibly giving Dalglish a role as Director of Football?), Dalglish doing ""what is best for Liverpool"" and all those sports cliches that everyone does.

Ultimately, I think Dalglish *should* stay and he deserves at least one more season. My personal opinion has always been that a figure like Dalglish should steady the Liverpool ship (in spite of disappointing results we *have* improved in many intangible ways) and then we can move on once his contract runs out.

""Kenny Dalglish has returned to Merseyside following talks with Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group (FSG), in Boston.

The Liverpool manager travelled to Massachusetts yesterday along with Steve Clarke, his assistant, and met with John W Henry and Tom Werner, the club’s principal owners, as part of an ongoing review into Liverpool’s performance last season.

As planned, Dalglish flew back to Heathrow after the meeting had ended, while Clarke remained in Boston where he accompanied Henry and Werner to Fenway Park to watch the Boston Red Sox record a comfortable 6-1 win over the Seattle Mariners.

Contrary to speculation that surfaced following the summit, Dalglish did not resign and nor was he sacked with the outcome of the talks being a mundane acceptance from all parties that the process of reviewing the season will continue.

Henry and Werner are seeking an explanation for Liverpool’s shortcomings during a disappointing campaign which culminated with them finishing in eighth place in the Premier League. The duo are also looking to Dalglish and Clarke to provide a vision of how they will revitalise the club’s fortunes.

Having already dismissed Damien Comolli from his role as director of football and a number of other senior executives, FSG have demonstrated that they will not shirk at making big decisions but they will know that removing Dalglish, a hugely popular figure amongst Liverpool’s support, would be another matter entirely.

For his part, Dalglish continues to plan for the future by scouting and targeting the players who he believes will help spark the kind of improvement that Liverpool’s owners are looking for. But until the review is concluded it is impossible to say with any great certainty that Dalglish will be in a position to put those plans into practice.""

The Rafa that only managed to salvage his first season with a lucky Champions League victory? The same guy who bought Xabi Alonso, and then forced him out? The one who bought duds such as Josemi, Crouch, Keane, Babel and Voronin? 

There's so much talk about how Benitez build a strong squad despite the owners. For all the owners' faults, they financed his buys of Torres, Babel, Voronin, Benayoun and Macherano. This is the guy who decided that buying an injured Aquilani was a good idea of a replacement for Alonso. 

Does Rafa have any good points? Yes. He is tactically very astute, and a very good manager for cup games where he can counter his opponents' strategy. In the league? We finished 2nd once, but outside of the Top 4 twice. Since 2000, we've finished outside of the Top 4 5 times. 2 of those times came under Benitez. 

There has been so many players who've come out to talk about Rafa's poor man management skills, including Gerrard and Carragher. Look at how he took over Mourinho's treble winning squad at Inter and ended up getting sacked in 6 months. 

I liked Rafa when he was here. He had some success with us, most notably in cup tournaments. I appreciate what he did, and he did lead us to what is invariably the best Champions League final ever. I swear though, there are so many of you who look on his time with rose-tinted glasses. His transfers were hit and miss. He had poor relations with many players. He made a joke of himself with his rant about Fergie. He was never as consistent in the league as people believed. 

Do you believe our current squad is poorer than the one which got to 2nd in the league? I do. That team had Alonso, Torres and Mascherano. Do you believe our current squad is poorer than the one that Benitez left? I do. That team had Mascherano and Torres. If Benitez led that team to 7th, how high do you think he's going to lead our current squad to?

&gt;* Rafa's poor man management skills*

I love the story about Rafa and Torres after Torres' child was born. Rafa approached him in training a few days after and congratulated him, Torres thought it was about the birth of a child but it turned out it was about a goal he had scored beforehand. It shows that to Rafa, all his players are just cogs that are apart of his machine, each one with a specific role, once the players carry out their jobs, nothing else matters. Sure his handling of players could be a little better, but look at Kenny, he seems very chummy with all the players but still they continuously go out on that pitch and look like they don't care. Regarding the Alonso situation, he hadn't the best of seasons before Rafa tried to sell him, after that he turned in his best season performance for Liverpool, it was very unfortunate the way it turned out, but yeah, Rafa could have handled it a bit better.

&gt; *This is the guy who decided that buying an injured Aquilani was a good idea of a replacement for Alonso.*

I believe his hand was forced here, Roma owed us money for the transfer of Riise and it was deducted from the overall cost of Aquilani. Signing Johnson was a similar matter in that Portsmouth owed us money for Crouch and it was deducted from Johnson's fee. These are by no means absolute fact, I've heard it numerous times since those transfers but it makes total sense. 

&gt; *there are so many of you who look on his time with rose-tinted glasses.*

I have serious doubts about Kenny leading us forward and if it wasn't for sentiment he'd be fired by now, I try not let rose tinted glasses cloud the way I view LFC matters,

&gt; *He made a joke of himself with his rant about Fergie.*

I thought it was hilarious tbh, he could have gone about it a bit better but it's something I wouldn't use to bash him, Fergies done far worse in interviews and had it been him making the rant the media would have dubbed it ""tactical mind games"" or whatever. The rant is no worse than Kenny wearing the Suarez t-shirt.

&gt; *Do you believe our current squad is poorer than the one which got to 2nd in the league?*

100%

&gt; *Do you believe our current squad is poorer than the one that Benitez left?*

100%

&gt; *how high do you think he's going to lead our current squad to?*

Higher than Kenny did imo

He is by no means the best manager in the world, but at the moment I believe that he is the best that we can realistically get, unless Mourinho or Guardiola want to be a hero and come and save us! Rafa loves the club and fought the fans corner against the old owners, if he were to come back and had the owners support I believe he would get us back in the top 4 and I'd have much more faith in him over Kenny or Martinez. 

This debate stemmed from Rafa or Martinez, you never explained why you would choose Martinez, what has he done that would make you choose him over Rafa?

Btw, I'm not trying to be an ass or anything by engaging in this debate you, I'm not down voting any of your comments simply because you hold a different opinion.

Since that does not happen to the DeLorean we must assume there is some mechanism that allows it to lock onto its relative location, in relation to current planet, area, or what have you, but not a room or building since they are constructs of minimal consequence, ie crashing into a building that didn't exist in his time when Marty goes back.  The TARDIS however is not a construct of minimal consequence since does not operate within our specific dimension, its insides are compressed space. Therefore by placing the DeLorean into a TARDIS it would travel in time relative to the compressed space inside the TARDIS since it is a consatnt environment, almost, regardless of dimensional shifting. The DeLorean could not reappear on earth because its moment of transfer is instantaneous and locked where as the TARDIS can move in space and time together the DeLorean does not so it would have to lock onto relative coordinate based on the dominant force at hand, which inside the TARDIS would be the compressed space.

In that time, Man U only led the league in defense three times. Vidic has only played with Man U since 2006, while Terry has been a starter and consistent performer for Chelsea since the late 90s.

That thread was created on 23 June, 2007. Meaning that SCP-173 was created *before* that date.

How long before is difficult to say, the direct 4Chan archives have failed and are unretrievable.

This means that SCP was created *at most* seventeen (17) days after the airing of ""Blink"" (9 June, 2007), possibly before.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Why do you want Kenny to stay? Maybe it's because I'm American, but I just don't see Kenny as our man. My Reasoning:

------------------------------------------

**Manager's Record:** We performed well in the cups and against the big teams - aka the games where the players are automatically motivated, without the help of a manager. but did really poorly in games where Kenny's managerial prowess were needed - the defensive lower-tier teams. 8th isn't good enough. **My grade: B-**

**Tactics:** His tactics are average and doesn't know his best XI. IMO has been biased towards his own signings - Downing and Henderson in particular - and unfair to prior signings such as Maxi, Kuyt, and Meireles --the players (along with suarez) that played so well at the end of last year. **My Grade: B**

**Transfers:** Kenny+Comolli did horribly in the transfer market. Like, the worst anybody has seen in years. Wasted at least 40m in my book. He made us a laughing stock for spending that much on Carroll, Downing, and Henderson. **My Grade: F**

**Public Relations:** He has been defensive and annoying in interviews. He handled the Suarez situation okay, but frequently made himself look like an ass throughout the year. Blamed ""bad luck"" way too often. **My grade: B-**

Hence my discussion of frames of reference; when on earth, the DeLorean appears and disappears in the same spot, with respect to the earth (a different spot with respect to the sun, in a different frame of reference).

This does imply that the DeLorean has some sort of Earth centric reference frame lock. This in turn suggests the *possibility* of frame selection, by some manipulation of the Earth centered 'frame-lock'. 

If this was possible, then in effect, the DeLorean, by utilising this frame-lock mechanism, could traverse both time and space almost freely.

If the inside of the TARDIS, as you say consist of compressed space, then spatial coordinates would still be relative to Earth's frame of reference and would not be affected by the Delorean reaching 88mph and travelling in time. (Only, instead of being 100m away from the door in the library, the Delorean would be 1mm away from the door in relation to the Earth).

However, this would imply that, a Delorean travelling at 88mph in compressed space, would actually be travelling much slower relative to its own reference frame, the Earth (with the velocity being reduced in proportion to the degree of space compression). So would, in this case, 88mph and thus time travel be even achievable at all without huge alterations to the machine?

Doctor Brown states that the stainless steel body of the DeLorean has a direct and influential effect on flux dispersal and activation of the flux capacitor. Within the TARDIS, the DeLorean would be travelling at 88mph relative to the inside of the TARDIS, and since the flux capacitor is also moving at 88mph within this reference frame, it is reasonable to assume that the velocity required to reach flux dispersal would be 88mph in whatever space the DeLorean was moving in.",0,1337114529,null,0,false,0,c4ofen8,t3_tmzqd,t1_c4ofen8,t1_c4oezup,null,1428931669,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Clepington Road (hilltown) was a nice flat but a very busy road. Avoid if you're a driver as parking is a nightmare. Also avoid if you plan on walking or cycling as the hill up is a bitch if the weather is bad or you're in a rush.

Polepark Road was a good location for city center access but it's not the best of areas, though not the worst.

Stobswell and Lochee are rougher parts of town, although I never lived there I did have friends who stayed there. Expect junkies and neds to be living nearby (no offence to anyone who lives there but it's true).

City center. It can get pretty rough and noisy on wed/fri/sat/sun nights (Dundee has a pretty good city center for shopping/nightlife). You get a good discount on secure car parks by living in the city centre so it's very handy if you drive. All in all the city centre is a good place to live if you can handle all the drunk students at night.

Nope.

Nope. I understand where this comes from (and vice versa, with Scots saying that the English all hate us), but it's just not like that :).

The first time was back at Nevada Smith's and we were on in the basement playing Bolton. He didn't tell anyone he was coming. No fanfare. He just showed up (with his GF and a bodyguard), quietly went downstairs, pulled up a barstool and started watching the game.

Eventually a couple people started whispering ""HOLY SHIT THAT'S ROMAN"" and someone who spoke Russian walked over and asked him if he was who they thought. And then the place went nuts.

He did it again the next year, interestingly enough also for Bolton. There are pictures on the NYB Facebook page.

Another funny Roman story:

A friend of mine is a Liverpool fan who goes to grad school in Boston. One morning he goes to the on-campus cafe to get his coffee and bagel, sits down, and sees Roman a few tables over reading the newspaper.

He goes over and says, ""Mister Abramovich, I have to ask, what are you doing here?""

Roman says - his English is still apparently pretty poor - ""my son, is visiting colleges. I wait while he looks around, goes to classes.""

My friend and Roman talk about football for a solid half hour, drinking coffee. My boy is knowledgeable, he played semi-pro back in college and played in a US Amateur Cup final. At one point my friend mentions that when he finishes grad school he'd love to work in football, that he'd been talking to reps from some MLS sides about it.

Roman says, ""you Chelsea fan?""

My friend says, ""no, Liverpool.""

Roman says, ""too bad. You Chelsea fan, I give you job.""

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I was really disappointed by Netflix's UK lineup. I'm seriously hoping they improve it within the next few months but I'm not getting my hopes up.

To give one small example of how shit it is, isn't anime meant to be pretty cheap to licence these days compared to big-name shows like Heroes, Game of Thrones etc?

I can literally list all the anime that is on Netflix UK:

* Sekirei - Never heard of it but it sounds like a typical fantasy anime that revolves around school pupils.
* Ghost in the Shell - One series, about 3 - 4 movies.
* The Disappearence of Haruhi Suzumiya - That's right, the Melancholy tv show is not available but rather a movie within the series.
* Two seasons of Gunslinger Girl
* Eden of the East (the 11 episode series and the movie)
* Afro Samurai (the original series and Ressurection) - Watched almost all of the first series but I don't see why they overhyped having Samuel L. Jackson as the voice for Afro Samurai, considering he barely fucking speaks.
* Tokko
* D Gray-man
* xxxHolic - Yes, the series you can fucking watch for free on Funimation's youtube channel without it being geo-blocked.
* Hetalia: Axis Powers - Literally a movie that personifies the great powers in World War II as children.
* Baccano
* Nabari
* Beyblade - On the plus side, at least it's the first season and not the shitty further seasons that were fucked up with a switch to boring CGI battles which just consist of two beyblades smacking into each other and nothing else.
* Junjo Romantica - A 'boys love' anime that is also ironically free to watch on Funimation's channel too. And this was recently added too....
* A few licensed Marvel superhero cartoons (don't know why this is in the anime section, and it's nothing groundbreaking either.)
* Three or four more obscure titles.

How could one fuck up an anime section so badly? Considering it's apparently very cheap to licence in comparison to some of the rare nuggets of gold they got on Netflix and the fact that you're actually paying for content, I am absolutely shocked that this has got less anime than even..... the free (non geoblocked that is) content Funimation has, and sites like Crunchyroll.

Where's Naruto? Where's Shaman King? Where's Dragonball? Where's any Studio Ghibli film? Where's Fullmetal Alchemist? Where's any of the other successful anime films that have seen decent success in the west? Where's Akira? Where's anything produced by Clamp? Where's Death Note? Where's Bleach?

I could go on and on about why every other section feels sucky but then I'd be dragging this out further than I'd want to. I feel like Netflix spent all their UK budget on getting Heroes, 24, Prison Break and a few big-name recent movies on there....",0,1337119109,null,0,1337119890,0,c4oghl6,t3_tnzlk,t1_c4oghl6,t3_tnzlk,null,1428932180,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Well they show Angels looking at other Angels and not locking them into a stone state, so that's a pretty big contradiction right there. They don't make a big deal about it, and when it happens you're really forced to realize how very, very contradictory it is to the entire point of Blink.

Further in Blink the Doctor states that them turning to stone is ""a fact of their biology"" and ""the ultimate defense mechanism"". But in Flesh and Stone we see them mistaking someone whose eyes are obviously closed for looking at them. This completely contradicts the instinctive nature, let alone the fact that a ""quantum lock"" is not a choice, it's a (as the Doctor says) ""fact of their biology"".

Further, there was no prior indication in Blink that the Angels could turn people into Angels (which in itself is a tired theme in Doctor Who that has been used by so many of the villains like Cybermen and the Gasmask Child and the Pog Dolls, etc.) and it really distorts the simple terror of the Angels and dilutes their originality.

Essentially the Angels behaved little like Angels. They try to make Amy ""like them"" and kill people instead of tossing them in time. A lot of the mechanics that *made them Angels* were either ignored or replaced with new powers. The show could have been about any alien enemy, and yet they try to force these new mechanics onto the Angels to throw in a popular name.

Further, in Blink we see Angels not viewed by anyone statues onscreen, implying that the audience themselves are active observers. This adds a personal level of danger, if not a subconcious one.

To show the Angels moving not only lessens their fear factor (they are now just moving statues instead of quantum unviewable horrors) but also pulls you out of the moment.",0,1337121847,null,0,false,0,c4oh3md,t3_toovx,t1_c4oh3md,t1_c4ogu95,null,1428932472,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,deepfriedmarsbar,null,null,"he did leave villa in a bit of a mess though. They had a ridiculus wage bill. Wasnt it Luke Young that turned down a move to liverpool because his wages were too high at Villa.

I think ONeil is a great motivator but not convinced he is a fergie type that will build a club, which is what we need now.

I really dont want to see Rafa back either. He did a good job and obviously won the CL. But he had his time and ultimately couldnt get liverpool over the finnish line when we had to chance to win the prem. He didnt cope with the pressure in my opinion and often seemed to do things just to try and prove people wrong rather than what was best. I really dont think we played very attractive football in general under benitez either. I almost always think it is a bad idea for people to go back to a club where it didnt work out. Although in a situation like Dalglish i think its different given why he left and his legendary status.

I really hope Dalglish gets time. Liverpool played some really good football this season and with some more clinical play and a bit more confidence could be a very strong team. Carrol and henderson are starting to show they are very good players, alhtough we certainly over paid for them. Downing isnt as bad as he played this year and with a bit of luck and some early season form could be a decent player for us, if not a world beater. We have a very strong back 5 with backup. Lucas will be back next year. Suarez is world class and im sure we will sign a couple of players in the summer.

We need to really make sure we get it right this summer though. We cant afford another summer of flops and future potential we need a couple of real class players in.

2 - His Charlie Chaplin style comedy and the fact that he could be funny but also serious at the same time.

3 - His dislike for authority figures. It's always nice to see someone who isn't afraid of shouting back at government officials when they're being idiots.

4 - Where to begin? Scarf. Jellybabies. His humor. His wit. Hair. The whispery voice he does when he's being serious. As you can probably guess he's my favorite

5 - He was more energetic. His character showed the Doctor to be more vulnerable unlike the almost super-hero character he had been portrayed as before.  

6 - Boy, is this a tough one... I guess some of his lines were good and his personality although not the best was still okay.

7 - His question mark umbrella and his interactions with Ace.

8 - I always liked how he looked. It was just like the Doctor should be. Intelligent if not a bit eccentric.

9 - His darker personality and how he incorporated aspects of previous Doctor's personalities. 

10 - His personality was just perfect for Doctor Who. I think he and Tom Baker ARE Doctor Who. They had such perfect roles. 

11 - Again, a tough one. I'm finding it quite hard to warm up to his performance as the Doctor.  I suppose he does come out with a few memorable lines and I must admit I love his Sonic Screwdriver.

The Doctor and Harry drag Hunt, still unconscious, through the door of the strange blue box. Harry looked around, confused.

""This... This is magic!""

""Rubbish!"" the Doctor exclaimed. ""It's just bigger on the inside! Simple physics! What kind of school did you go to, eh?""

Before Harry had time to reply, the tall, strange man ran towards a large console on the middle of the room. It looked to be covered in an array of knobs, buttons, and strange household objects. Harry thought that the console looked rather like something Mr Weasley might have attempted to throw together, but on a larger scale. Lights blinked on and off, and strange noises were emitting from it.

The Doctor began dashing around the console, sometimes pressing a button, other times twisting a dial. Harry thought he even saw him hammer a computer monitor using an under-ripe banana he had pulled from his jacket pocket. 

The loud sound which had awoken Harry had started again. ""What's going on?"", he yelled, as the noise rose to a crescendo. ""I'm looking for an old friend."" the Doctor replied.

""What is this place?"" Harry asked.

""This,"" The Doctor replied, ""is my TARDIS."" The Doctor spoke to Harry with a strange mix of pride, and the tone one might use to talk to a small child. ""Time and relative dimension in space. It can take me anywhere, anywhen. And, as you may have noticed, it's - ""

"" - got an extension charm, to create extra space inside?"" Harry interrupted.

""Don't be ridiculous.""

Harry was becoming more confused by the minute. But, before he could ask any more questions, the TARDIS started to shudder violently. The strange noise once again ringed in Harry's ears. Then, as suddenly as it had started, the vibrations stopped.

""We're here!"" The Doctor said, gleefully.

""Where?"" asked Harry, starting to get a little bit annoyed by this strange man and his ability to provide both an unlimited number of questions, and a complete lack of answers.

The Doctor pointed at a monitor on the console. The picture was showing a large casino room, filled with men smoking cigars and drinking whiskey. At one table sat a fierce-looking man with dirty blonde hair, wearing a perfectly-tailored tuxedo. The man signaled to a waiter, and his voice was magnified through the large speakers underneath the TARDIS's console. ""I'll have a vodka martini, please. Shaken, not stirred.""

So, they fell back on what they knew: deep statistical analysis of players. The ""moneyball"" way, if you will. That led them to Comolli, who is the football version of baseball's Billy Beane (I think they are friends, even). The Red Sox have been successful using that approach, but FSG have had years of experience learning the nuances of baseball, which allows them to point a more keen eye at players. They just didn't have the experience. Which gets them to a guy like Comolli, which is as close to a guy they do know in a sport they know that they could find.

While Dalglish had to make the final choices, the pool of players he had to choose from came from Comolli. Given a full season in the Premiereship, and time to learn how to evalute the game and players, and get some experience, I'm confident that Kenny can make the right choices in the transfer market this time around, without a one-track mind like Comolli to muck things up.

The official marches in London nearly all go down the banks of the Thames and past the Houses of Parliament, more often than not they end up in Hyde Park.  Right through the very heart of London.  If you want to arrange a static protest Trafalgar Square is purposely allowed as is St Jame's Park.  It's more like you have a right to protest but don't think that means you have a right to break the law whilst on a protest, which is exactly what people get confused with.

It's really not a problem other than with the ignorant minority and the arrogant minority.  The arrogant minority think they can just flaunt the law despite it endangering other people.  The ignorant minority follow them not knowing what they're doing.  These are the people that end up causing and getting kettled.  The informed and law abiding turn up, take part in a protest and are able to go home without event, and if everything goes to plan the media will be able to report on them.
