That is, capitalism based on State intervention in the market to benefit capitalists (which reflects your comment about privatised profits and socialised losses above), based on Sloanist models of mass production that create a ""grow or die"" model of ""competition"".

Growth comes from a number of sources, growth of population (energy dependent), increases in efficiency - usually ether increased exploitation of labour or improvements in technology (also energy dependent) and increased energy inputs.

It spawned more than its share of popular catchphrases, and introduced the Weeping Angels (who were subsequently ruined in their next appearance), but is that what brings a good episode into the category of ""the best?"" 

*The Family of Blood* was an excellent character piece showing the terrible decisions The Doctor has to make, and the consequences of even his relatively minor actions, like where to land. *The Girl in the Fireplace* was a great New Who episode that captured the feel of Classic Who very well. *Midnight* is more abjectly terrifying than most, and *Dalek* does a better job of (re)introducing a villain species than *Blink* does. And that's just in the New Series!

*Blink* has some pretty funny bits in it and new villains who, if you think about it, aren't that scary. In *Blink*, if you do actually blink, you aren't actually dead like The Doctor warns. You're just zapped back in time. Why isn't this scary? Because it has already happened to the main characters of the show, and they are perfectly fine. ~~Inconvenienced, but fine. (Yes, I know - if the Angels get the TARDIS, they have a lot of energy to feed off of and The Doctor is stranded and so forth. He will still be alive if that happens. Remember the Third Doctor?

Don't you think he wanted Liverpool to succeed? Each manager has a certain set of skills and tactics that they work with. Hodgson at Liverpool is the same Hodgson who managed Inter Milan. His tactics didn't work at Liverpool, but to say that he was hell-bent on turning Liverpool into a mid-table side? His own players were criticizing him weekly on his tactics, which led to even more disgruntlement. I was honestly irked when Agger gave his interviews about hoofing the ball into the air. You NEVER air your dirty laundry in public. Not at Liverpool. What Agger did simply alienated Hodgson from the fans even further.

Of course I wanted him to do better. I continued to cheer him on despite his many shortcomings at the beginning. However, towards the end of the first half of the season things reached a point where there was just no more defending him. He was obviously out of his depth and not the right man for the club. Even the most hardcore of the hardcore LFC fans could see that.

Let me put it this way - Hodgson was by no means the cause of Liverpool's problems, but he was also not the man to solve them. Wanting to see him replaced by someone who could work towards solving them does not make a person a bad fan.

Seems a lot like the human instinct to pattern match and interpret coincidences as significant events. Given that some of these are tautological for a TV show set in ""present day"", attributing the other couple fairly minor events to coincidence, especially given that they line up with desired character age.

There's also, of course, the fact that a lot of years could be picked as significant, especially if we're going to the level of first/last year for any particular doctor (as ALL of these are, other than ""plot points for seasons occur on air dates of big episodes"" -- of course that was intentional, but not very notable).

true,PJL,k9,K-9,"I quite like him, but I think he was better when he was writing single episodes rather than at the helm. The episodes he wrote for the first three seasons were some of my favorites (perhaps all my favorites for each of those seasons). Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead could have been great, but I couldn't quite make the leap from the quite awesome ""Count the shadows"" to the cheesy skeleton in a space suit ""Hey! Who turned out the lights?"" 

My main problem with him now (an issue I also had with RTD at the helm -- could just be pressure from above at the BBC, for all I know) is that series finales lack any sort of subtlety. 

**Spoilers follow:**

* [spoiler](/s ""Daleks threatening to destroy Earth and then universe -- deus ex machina"")
* [spoiler](/s ""Daleks and cybermen threatening to destroy Earth and then universe -- deus ex machina"")
* [spoiler](/s ""Master threatening to destroy Earth and then universe -- deus ex machina"")
* [spoiler](/s ""Daleks threatening to destroy universe by USING Earth -- deus ex machina"")

Along with of course the [spoiler](/s ""constant final destruction of every last dalek/cyberman/master -- oh whoops here they are again"").

I don't feel Moffat has improved upon this -- pandorica was almost worse, given the sheer number of baddies they brought in. Again, facing similar levels of catastrophe. I'll give that Moffat doesn't really resort to the deus ex machina as heavily as RTD did though, but it still feels like they're trying too hard to constantly one-up themselves with how grand and epic they can be.

I know Moffat can write for subtlety. ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" was amazing -- just as much if not more tension, but the whole thing was over a single life. Didn't have to threaten the end of the planet/galaxy/universe/all of time. Sherlock is also brilliantly written and doesn't resort to such silliness. I feel like the BBC is pressuring them into it because of how they perceive their audience/genre. They're happy to let Sherlock be more subtle, but DW has to be flashy and big. It's hard to do flashy and big really well. Maybe I was too hard on RTD all these years, too, if the fault is really higher in the food chain.

Still not forgiving him for ""Aliens of London"", which I believe he actually wrote himself, or ""Daleks in Manhattan"", which I don't think RTD wrote, but he should have stepped in and kept it from happening.

I still have a ton of fun watching -- I know this post/rant seems pretty negative. I'm just a bit disappointed Moffat isn't cranking out 13 ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" level episodes every season :)

With Moffat running the show, there's no filter. I'm not sure how the writing is structured on his team, but as executive producer and showrunner, I don't imagine he gets too many vetoes on his story ideas.

Besides, if *Doctor Who Confidential* has thought me anything, it's that anybody who works on *Doctor Who* (with the possible exception of Christopher Eccleston) succumbs to a huge case of groupthink. Every episode is the best *Doctor Who* episode ever, the greatest *Doctor Who* episode ever.

true,Loki_The_Trickster,tardis,TARDIS,"Go through what is said and what is shown and *really* think about it, though. Angels are supposed to be creepy because they move very quickly and without warning, and they look like benign angel statues. I accept that, and that *would* be scary, but both the initial execution and the two other times we see them (at least that I can remember) in the Byzantium episodes and holograms in The God Complex are totally lame.

In *Blink*, the Angels shouldn't be judged too harshly, as they aren't fleshed out yet as to the rules of what they can and cannot do. However, there are some blatantly confusing things about them. We all know about the quantum locking. It's what turns them into stone, after all. It is also said that it is a ""fact of their biology - they can't help it,"" (I know that's Eleven's quote and not Ten's, just go with it) and they evolved that way. Stop right there. How does any creature, that when it is being ""observed in any way it turns to stone,"" evolve - much less mate a single time? If this can be explained to me, I will be ready to consider that up is down and left is right. Keep in mind, I'm not just holding Angels to this standard, nor am I alone. Daleks, Cybermen, and Timelords all have unique ways of breeding or growing in number, and they are all explained in detail in the show. It isn't unreasonable to wonder how Angels make more Angels, and how the first of them came to be.

In *The Time of Angels*, we are told that an image of an Angel becomes an Angel. This is probably the most important plot point in these two episodes. We are shown the taped Angel beginning to move with each burst of static (which was done pretty well), then it becomes a ghost-Angel, then inside Amy's head, it starts counting her down and driving her crazy. Sure, why not. Why this means she should **close her eyes** and be stuck imagining it in her mind, like any terrified person would, instead of looking at other shit to try to... Hey wait a minute, why doesn't that happen to **anyone** who sees a Weeping Angel? Would the effect not be more powerful coming straight from an actual Angel to the brain rather than Angel to videotape to ghost to brain? You know what? Whatever. That was a pretty weak concept to begin with.

We also see that the Angels have fallen apart over time. Does this mean that in their quantum-locked state, they can just be smashed? Why not carry around a sledgehammer and knock off the quantum-locked Angels' heads?

*Flesh and Stone* does the worst thing possible and shows them moving - while Amy is less than a foot away with her eyes closed. These are creatures that are supposed to move *so fast*, you can't even-blink-blink-and-you're-dead-don't-blink-good-luck. Oh yeah, remember that living-in-your-imagination thing? Turns out that was bullshit? I could never be completely sure. The lazy resolution to that **MAJOR** plot point just lends more evidence that it should never have been put on film.

We get additional lameness and confusion in *The God Complex*, where we are shown perfect, three-dimensional replicas of Angels. If *anything in the universe* were to take the image of an Angel and *ever* become one itself, **it would be a perfect hologram of one**. And yet, they do nothing. They are completely harmless. Does this mean the writers are undoing their mistake? I hope so.

All of these things make the Weeping Angels weak, non-threatening monsters that have nothing going for them besides *omg*TEETH!! The only improvement they have undergone is they actually kill people instead of feeding off of their time-energy. (And aren't they starving themselves while doing that?)

I know I'm taking this too seriously, but it's because I love Doctor Who so much that I hold it to such high standards.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Whilst it's absolutely true that you can't eliminate relative poverty defined in terms of averages except by totally eliminating inequality, it's also true that inequality is an important measure in its own right.  It's also fair comment that without factoring in cost of living measures geographically, then measures based on income won't tell the whole story (I make the same comment when people express outrage about low salaries in the developing world without taking this into account - most expats become far richer working in developing countries even when they take a considerable hit on salary because the local economy is significantly cheaper).  But the discrepancies are obviously significant in terms of geographical mobility and purchasing power for those things which are priced similarly nationally.

If I'm relatively poor compared to you, you still have the power to coerce and exploit me, if I'm absolutely poor, that power will obviously be significantly more compelling.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; Because poverty is defined as 60% of the average wage, you will by statistical necessity 
have people who are poor.

Mathematical necessity for being poor... where on earth did you get this idea.

The mean is not a useful source for defining what poverty is because wealth distributions probably have a huge amount of skew, the median is what they actually used. This is clearly stated in the article as *one* of the measures:

&gt; Greatest likelihood to contain households whose income is less than 60% of the **median** for England

I believe the article deliberately didn't say ""the average"" because its confusing to people that don't know anything about statistics. According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom):

&gt;In 2010, the median wage in the UK for all jobs was £20,801

60% of which, is of course, £12,480. There is absolutely no *mathematical* reason why, what people earn has to be less than this value, it is the ""middle value"" of the data.

In fact even if it were the mean value it is not *statistical necessity* that any people at all earn less than £12,480. You define your model and tests to fit the data you have collected; anything else would be useless.

&gt; The real question - which the data doesn't provide, is the level of ""absolute poverty"" which is defined by the lack of food/housing/heating.

Why is that the real question? There is a direct correlation between the a gap in wealth and the following factors:

* Rates of depression
* Rates of obesity
* Lower life expectancy
* Heart disease
* Rates of crime

And that's just to start with.

We live in a developed western democracy, absolute poverty (as you define it) is not the main social problem we face but, rather, an increasing gap between the richest quartile and the poorest quartile that has been shown to correlate with the issues I have mentioned above.

I don't understand. Surely, the ratio is 0.95 (or whatever) *every single bet*. The machine does not keep track of previous results. (Or do they?)

Surely it is a gamblers' fallacy to insist that a particular machine is 'due' to pay out?

If I toss a coin 5 times and it's heads each time, should I bet tails on the sixth toss? No, it doesn't matter which way I bet, because the chances of tails on the 6th toss are still 50%. As far as I know, poker machines are the same.

Yes, of course some people pirate in place of buying, but it's not as if the majority, faced with an inability to torrent content, would suddenly start buying it.

I'm the perfect example. I've been buying DVDs since 1999; Blu-Rays since around 2009. I've spent comfortably in excess of £25,000 on both formats - and that's just on the discs. I've also probably spent £10,000 on books [physical, and ebooks] *and* I have a netflix account.

I still pirate content, however. Mostly because it's easier. Take BSG for example - I have the series on blu-ray. If I want to watch that show on my iPad, it's far, *far* easier to download HD rips, and stream them, than it would be to rip a product I purchased, legally.

Then there's books - I use the internet as a library for eBooks. If I download an ebook from a torrent site and end up liking it? More often that not I not only buy a commercial copy of said book [either as a legitimate eBook, or a physical book] **AND** I end up, if I become a fan of the author, buying other works of theirs.

If I download a book and I don't like it? No I won't buy a copy. And yes, technically that is copyright infringement. But given that I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place - nor borrowed it from a public library [the ones near me have nigh-on anaemic stock levels], then the author / publisher isn't losing out.",0,1331036449,null,0,false,0,c3y6wgk,t3_qk0n4,t1_c3y6wgk,t3_qk0n4,null,1428476115,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

Not the least of this would be the threat, which was recently raised, that spousal visas were going to require evidence of a GBP35k a year income.  

Add to this that, once you get off the corporate/career treadmill, it's increasingly difficult to return to it, whether you desire to or not, because CVs have to be almost immaculately conceived these days (especially these economically shaky days), and evidence of self-employment and rat-race avoidance is usually taken to mean someone hasn't ""got their head right"" or is risky, non-corporate material.

OK, so return is unlikely in current circumstances, and, in all honestly, unlikely unless I could return with enough ""fuck you"" money to live the good life until they put me in the ground.

Here's a good comment copied from torrentfreak:

""UK law is at least clear and tested on this point, thanks to Judge Birss. They still have to show that you performed the act or authorised someone else to do so. Even if they get the the IP gathering right, and match it through the ISP, all they have is a router address. They will have NO IDEA AT ALL who performed the copying. If they want to prove authorisation - well - that's an impossible job. They pretty much have to have it in writing. Again, simply because it happened doesn't mean the accountholder did it or authorised it. There are so many possibilities:

Open Router (stil legal here...)

Hacked Router

IP mistakenly gathered

IP mistakenly matched

Account holder not the infringer (or authorisor)

And this is just torrenting. So next step is that we get something as ineffectual as HADOPI and they cut off a few 12 year olds. What pisses me off is that there will be two likely results (as seen courtesy of a certain Mr Crossley):

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;This is where the Raspberry Pi can save us: it’s now affordable for the government to equip any child in this country with a machine which they could take home with them and play with.

It's also, in an age where the amount of information available outstrips that of all human history, easy to teach children and adults how to cook a healthy, nutritionally well-balanced meal. And yet the number of obese people in this country continues to increase.

Simply supplying something, doesn't mean it'll happen. I could teach people how to spend no more than £40 per month, yet eat healthy, nutritious meals, every day - it doesn't mean they're suddenly going to go out and cook their own meals.

Same concept with the Pi. It's a fantastic device, but simply putting in into schools won't yield a generation of Peter Molyneuxs [I could have picked others, but his history of hyping up products before launch seems to tie in well with the Pi.]

&gt;Furthermore if the government keeps its promise to stop giving lessons about how to use Microsoft Word and start teaching some decent subjects we will soon have a generation of highly-skilled workers at our fingertips ready to export product to the world.

While I personally welcome the news that I.T. lessons are likely to increase in scope, I think it's foolish to expect it'll be expanded to include any kind of computer science context. Where are the teaching staff, with a sufficient technical background, going to come from?

&gt;It’s great to hear that Nissan are creating new jobs in this country but I believe we need to start moving away from the dinosaur industries and create a grass-roots, decentralised and highly skilled workforce of creators in order to export again.

Actually, given the number of children who leave school with little / no qualifications, a return to manufacturing would be ideal. That's not to say for one second people who work in those industries are illiterate - far, far from it, but having had relatives who worked at Rover, having failed their schooling - they'd be the first to admit, that whilst not being an easy job, it's perhaps more relastic than expecting school-leavers to be proficient in #C.

&gt;And we need to start giving the software industry the respect it has in the States.

Aren't most programming jobs in the States being outsourced to emerging economies such as India? Something worth thinking about, if we plan to train a generation of kids to become IT Specialists, all wanting £30k+ a year, when someone in India can do a comparable job for a third of the cost.

Found some stuff here

http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/skin-cancer/about/skin-cancer-screening

&gt;At the moment there is no general screening programme in the UK for non melanoma skin cancer. If there were a screening programme, it would take up a great deal of time and money. It could be argued that it does not make sense to spend such a lot on picking up cancers that are slow growing and nearly always curable. Non melanoma skin cancers are most common on areas exposed to the most sun, and so patients or their close friends or relatives usually spot them in plenty of time to have successful treatment.

and some info that, although for lung cancer, does have relevance

&gt;There is no reliable screening available for lung cancer yet. You can have a chest X-ray or CT scan, but both of these would be exposing you to radiation, probably unnecessarily. You can have both these investigations done privately. A doctor would not order these tests unless you had symptoms that could be due to a lung cancer though.

&gt;A scan can only find a tumour about the size of a pea, and by that time it contains millions of cells. An X-ray can only pick up a lung cancer that is more established than that. You could have a clear scan, but may then worry about having a cancer too small to be found. And what about in a year's time? Would you want another scan then? If you were to have a yearly X-ray to check for lung cancer, over a lifetime the radiation exposure would significantly increase your risk of breast cancer, and possibly also lung cancer.

That last sentence seems particularly worth bearing in mind.

true,kr239,eng-eastsusex,Portslade,"Well...i've been living in france on and off for 12 years. Originally as a carer for my mum, but its a nice place to live out here so i came back in '08. I have 4 acres of land, one solitary neighbour and a load of trees. It's nice &amp; quiet. I have a huge space to work on cars. Cost of living is lower than the UK (no road tax, sane insurance prices for a start). My outgoings are half what they were in the UK. 

I do plan on coming back, because the UK will always be 'home', as this house is becoming a bit of a millstone round my neck. Here's a list of things you miss about the UK. Primarily, it's bookstores, and cinema's.

There are cinema's that show english language films, but the nearest one is an hour and a half round trip from here by car or train. The ability to go out and have a drink in a pub is hampered by the distances out here. In the UK, you're within walking distance of at least half a dozen pubs. Out here, to get to the nearest one, you need to drive. Which requires a designated driver. Hard to organise when most people i know here are also several miles away.

Then, there's stuff like supermarkets. I will admit that french supermarkets carry far more variety now than they used to, but the opening hours leave a lot to be desired. In the UK, supermarkets are open 24 hours a day, with the exception of sundays, which are still restricted by daft regulations. Out here - they're only open from 9am to 7pm, and rarely open on sundays or bank holidays. I miss the freedom to wander into a Tesco Extra with friends on a friday at 3am, and get all the rotisserie counter stuff for 50p each, and pig out in the car park.

Those are the big things i miss. But then there's also the food you can get from the UK that i miss. 

* Streaky Bacon &amp; Back Bacon - The french just don't do bacon unless it's belly pork thickness. Can't really make a sandwich out of it.
* Cheddar Cheese - ohhh the joy that's a doorstop thick cheddar cheese sandwich - Nothing remotely similar out here, so i make do with Gouda.
* English sliced wholemeal bread - to be fair, the french are slowly improving on their sliced bread, but it's still too stodgy and thin. Proper English sliced bread is fucking amaaaazing - nice thick slices, it toasts well, not to stodgy and has a wonderful taste with butter on it.
* English Milk - See, the french do very good quality milk, but the best you can get, is semi-skimmed, and it tastes partially sweetened, compared to English milk. Nothing beats opening the fridge, taking out a 6-pint carton of whole milk (none of that low fat shit either), and just downing half of it in one fell swoop.
* Marmite &amp; Bovril - Marmite i don't miss as much as Bovril, and i have an XL size jar in the cupboard for a rainy day, but i'm all out of Bovril, and this makes me sad
* OXO Cubes - Nothing beats it. Nothing.
* Being able to buy pita bread &amp; humus - i can make my own humus, but it's a chore to do now my food processor has packed up. Pita bread out here isn't the same either - and there's no wholemeal option.
* British Sausages. We have such a variety in the UK, whereas the french have just two, and although they're nice, they're a bit overpowering.
* Black pudding - sliced and ready to fry - OMNOMNOMNOMNOM!
* Cheap packets of noodles - In the UK - 8p per pack. In France, 10x the price.
* Sesame Oil - Seriously, i can't find it bloody anywhere!
* Porridge Oats - A bag of rolled oats in the UK is about £1. Here, the concept of humans eating oats is alien to the French - they regard it as Horse feed.
* Colemans English Mustard - Don't get me wrong, Dijon is nice, but nothing beats clearing out your sinuses &amp; setting your nostrils on fire when you use Colemans ;)
* Ribena - blackcurrant cordial that's not Ribena just doesn't taste quite right. The alternatives are all far too sweet.
* Golden Syrup - 'nuff said.
* Takeaways &amp; Fast Food - Seriously, i haven't had chinese food in almost a year. The only time i get to have it these days, is when i go over to Guernsey to see my fiancee, which happens maybe once every 6 months. I miss KFC, Burger King, Curry Houses, Pizza Hut - not that i want to eat them every day but once in a while i'd love to be able to pick up the phone and have some asshole on a scooter deliver me some piping hot MSG laden junk!

Non food stuff you miss: 

* Petrol Stations with a proper forecourt that open 24 hours a day - nothing more fucking irritating than needing fuel, having cash in your pocket, and not being able to buy any because the only places that sell fuel past 7pm are automated and use card only -_-
* Motor factors that sell you anything you could want for your car that the dealer charges you stupid money for. France has a few chains of auto parts stores, but they charge silly money. Example - i need a 50ah/430CCA 12v battery for the polo. UK Price? £39.99 French Price? £107.55 ITS SHIT LIKE THIS THAT DRIVES ME NUTS
* No hire shops for tools. Ohhh what i could do with a TIG welder from time to time. HSS Hire in the UK would rent one out - but there's nothing like that in France.
* Machine shops - in the UK, they're still not common, but you can find them and they're not too pricey. In France, there's ONE within 100 miles of me, and they charged me £125 to extract a fucking exhaust stud. £125!!!! O.o
* Public transport - To be fair, i can't really pin that on France, because i do live in the middle of nowhere - the situation would be similar if i were in the UK. But i still miss not having to drive everywhere and just jump on the W3 bus to go to Wood Green.

I don't see this article as 'masturbatory', I see it as hopeful. Our manufacturing base in the UK has been severely damaged in the last few decades because of short sighted governmental policies. At the moment, one of the *very few* areas in which we have any sort of an edge is hardware (for example with ARM) and software (pick any startup in London).

An ironic statement, given that this paragraph lacks perspective. I don't think anyone is expecting 5 years old kids to start knocking out Linux Kernel code. What many are *hoping* it will do is empower people of all ages to start learning with play (or if you prefer ""tinkering""), which I've found is the best way to learn anything. 

If it's a success, then a lot of kids are going to find technology as a whole a lot less frightening and mysterious, which will hopefully translate in the long run to a technological and manufacturing lead.

Met my Texan wife a few years ago, didn't have any strong ties back home so took the plunge and moved away. I sold pretty much all my books, DVDs and clothes and just kept my personal stuff on a couple of hard drives.

I think it's easier moving to America than any other country (except maybe Canada or Australia) because:

* They speak English
* I've seen their movies and TV. I haven't had any nasty surprises about the culture
* I love food and exciting stuff

The only things I miss so far:

* Proper big slices of bacon
* A Chinese or Indian takeaway within walking distance
* Prices in shops being the price with tax so you can get your money ready before paying. Although I do it on card anyway, but you get the idea.

I never really felt or wanted to feel part of society back home (living in a shitty East London borough) so I don't feel like I have lost out.

Besides, the only things I could ever miss (BBC 6Music, QVC/Ideal World!) I can listen to online.

I can still watch football online, it's just a bit weird having a beer and snacks at 2pm for the weekday games and 6.45-10.00am for the weekend games.

&gt; I received one of these letters and it sparked a huge argument between me and my ISP. I won - here's how:
I often work from home and have to download HUGE files (I'm a radiologist and an MRI set can be several gigabytes). Our hospital sets these files up on a server ready to be downloaded, and they get automatically downloaded throughout the day to the relevant radiologist working off site. The file formats are encrypted (for patient confidentiality) and the download software uses a version of BitTorrent, which in itself is a completely legitimate way of downloading large files. I received a cease and desist letter from my ISP, which said they had evidence that I was downloading 'illegal' content. I argued that they couldn't possibly see what I was downloading as the files are encrypted (if they were looking somehow then they breached patient confidentiality), and in any case it was a perfectly legitimate reason for me to be downloading large BitTorrent files. A few letters back and forth, including a statement from my place of work detailing the nature of these files and I received an apology from them and a letter stating that I would be taken off their 'watch' list. I guess I can now go download 'illegal' torrents without worrying. I dont really do this much (I have Netlix, iTunes and not that much time to watch movies) other than for TV shows that have already aired on UK TV (I pay my TV license so that should cover it right?). Anyway, it's been 18 months and I've not had anymore complaints.

**TL;DR**: There are legal uses for BitTorrent and your ISP can't tell the difference.

Any costs saved in initial licenses is immediately taken up by training, etc. Actually *destroyed* might be a better word, but ultimately the NHS IT systems have been around a lot, lot longer than almost anything else - their patient record systems live on custom-built databases, that in turn are old enough that we used to run 'File Contiguation Exercises' on their disk packs (nowadays known as defragging). It isn't just a matter of feeding them into SQL.

The trouble with having an in-house dev team is that if you pay them decent money, other gov. departments immediately demand more money too; in many areas, the government becomes a victim of its' own rules, but what you then have left are developers that have been in the same job for twenty-thirty years, have been left behind by technology long, long ago, and in some cases can't be sacked because they're union reps.

While I have reservations of my own with both Mou's &amp; Pep's individual styles, if the final choice does come down to ONLY these two, then I'd probably go with Pep rather than Mou - assuming of course that he will help build the youth system at Cobham.

Then again, which self-respecting manager would want to come and screw up his career knowing fully well that RA has a twitchy trigger finger &amp; the dressing room is full of prima donnas? Worse, they have been given an ultimatum, so it might even be likely that they don't care anymore...

Also, why would Mou (especially) want to come back to the dressing room that he built almost a decade ago, knowing fully well that he would have to sack the same players he brought in? Unless of course, the rumors of Terry causing Mou's departure are true, in which case, there is the 'revenge' angle to consider... 

One potential way out of this: RDM, RA &amp; his coterie of clowns ensures that old-guard leaves on the 30th of June (end of season) and Mou joins on the first of July and starts making big name signings - as he is wont to do. Why? Because history tells us that Mou hasn't trusted the youth system of any club he has worked with - unless they have proven themselves in the earlier seasons, of course.

Growth in GDP is not the physical growth of anything. It's the growth in the value of goods and services produced. We can find new things to do with our limited supply of resources.

If, for example, I can work at home more efficiently via the Internet instead of buying a petrol-driven car and driving a 50m round trip every day; then my resource use (of petrol, cars etc) has diminished while the value I'm adding may even increase.

I couldnt of done anything different and i wouldnt but sometimes a name get picked out of a hat and theres nothing you can do. But will say the grass isnt always greener on the other side, the biggest problem we had was with other Expats who spent the whole time moaning and whinging that things werent the same as back ""home"", some of them had been there 20 odd years. Surely the whole point of going somewhere else is for the differences. We embraced the culture shock, if that makes sense. So now i am back kinda homeless (living with the inlaws) jobless (still got a job waiting for me in Canada if i can get back) and broke, spent a pretty penny figthing immigration and getting back.

But no regrets shit happens and it gives you a different slant on things being the foreigner and now returning back and trying to see the brighter side of things.

What i missed the most tho was alway food things. Bacon (candian bacon is crap streaky and crispy), currys (it was like meat with tomato sauce on and chilly powder) and fish and chips.

If you're into Art and Culture, then [FACT](http://www.fact.co.uk/) is definitely worth a look, along with the [Walker](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/). FACT is very contemporary with new and original exhibits, with a lot of exhibits being across multiple media and very cutting edge, the Walker is more classical (although there is a Banksy sculpture there).

Oh and the [Bluecoat](http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/) is another, more central gallery, with new exhibits, as well as being adjacent to the main commercial area, Liverpool ONE

The [Albert Dock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_dock) and the [Three Graces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Head), are certainly worth a visit (the Museum of Liverpool is situated on the waterfront next to the Three Graces too), with this waterfront area being a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

[St. George's Hall](http://www.stgeorgesliverpool.co.uk/) is another landmark in the city, a Victorian hall built in a neoclassical style, offering (self-guided) tours with some history about it and the city. It's near Lime St Station (itself a landmark and a brilliant example of Victorian engineering, once acting as one of the busiest hubs outside of London).

[The Empire Theatre](http://www.atgtickets.com/venue/Liverpool-Empire/174/) is approximately opposite St. George's Hall and is an old theatre that houses the most major productions in the city.

***
**Shopping**

[Liverpool ONE](http://www.liverpool-one.com/website/home.aspx) is filled with all the global designer brands you'd expect, as well as one or two more boutique retailers. It has a couple of department stores, as well as a cinema (although FACT is a far nicer experience for a cinema). 

A better area for shopping (Liverpool ONE is good, but very generic) is Bold St., which has many more independent shops, cafés, and a couple of restaurants too.

***
**Food**

As a local, my absolute favourite area to eat is likely Lark Lane, the prices are usually less than $100AUD for 3 people for 2 courses, so quite reasonable and good food and atmosphere too, it's next to Sefton Park, which is quite nice during the day, although not unmissable. However this area is a taxi journey away from the city centre.

In the main centre, in and around Liverpool ONE are restaurants serving just about any cuisine you could hope for, with personal highlights (for evening meals) being [Alma de Cuba](http://www.alma-de-cuba.com/) (serving brilliant food in an old church, a truly brilliant place).

true,SpandexBob,english,London,"I've got an example of pirating that I do because its the only way I've been able to get the content.

I'm a fan of The Daily Show.  This used to be broadcast on Channel4 and available on 4od.  So Channel4 have the rights to the show in the UK, fine.  

But they changed and now all they show is the ""Global Edition"" which is a round up of the ""best bits"" of the week.  So I thought maybe I'd now be able to use the Daily Show website to watch the bits I'd missed.  Nope, because apparently I can watch it on 4od, well no I can't.  So what do I do, I pirate it, because its the only way I can get hold of it.

What annoys me the most about this is that in a world where digital content can go around the entire world in less than a few hours things are still being restricted by country.  

For TV at least, as far as I can tell its the middle men (TV channels and cable companies) that are holding us back.  Ironically the best option we have at the moment are more middle men in the form of netflix or lovefilm.  There isn't a replacement for these middle men, I can't see any other way to fund large productions without these middle men to commission and pay for series, this is very much just how I see it working, I don't work in the industry so please if I'm wrong correct me.  

Now I'd happily pay for a decent online service, but nothing like that exists.  I tried to used both netflix and lovefilm but can't as I'm not a Windows user and the studios demand DRM on the streams.  And as far as I can see the current VoD film services are expensive for what they are.  I'm not going to pay £4 for a film on Film4 that i'll only be able to stream and can't keep, but I'll pay £4 for the Louis CK thing despite having never seen him before because I get a file I can keep and it was just as easy to get legally as it would have been to pirate it.

Anyway, about the episode, it is an excellent character piece and allows us a perspective that has previously been ignored: that of those left behind. We see Jackie as an entirely different person, she is lonely after losing her daughter and just wanting some form of her own companionship.

We see LINDA, a group of people who have had some form of personal tragedy or meeting with the Doctor band together and enrich each other's lives for the better. They're not like Lorna Bucket, waiting for the Doctor to run with them again, they're making their own life on Earth a better one - and completely by accident.

We see Elton's tragic life unfold in a subtle and saddening way - and it shows that meeting the Doctor is not always a good thing. It resulted in the death of his mother that he mentally repressed. We see LINDA healing that personal tragedy.

And then to top it off, their group is torn apart because of their contact with the Doctor. A catch-22, joined because of him, cannot stay together because of this.

Remember, he just started out by wanting to see the universe, to travel, and to help out occasionally - not become an avenging angel, a mighty warrior able to recruit Silurians and Sontarans to capture a space station. 

I really do like the idea of him being alone. Here is he, with a time machine, able to travel anywhere in time and space...but his family is all dead. He has friends as companions, but they can't travel with him forever. They age and die, they move on with their lives. He can't - he has no home to go back to. 

It's one of the things that makes the character of the Doctor so interesting, that for the dozens and dozens of companions he had (yes, the ones before Rose count), he's still on his own. It's become a vogue thing for companions to say they're going to travel with him ""forever"", but they have no idea what ""forever"" means. They will die, they will choose to go back to their lives, but he doesn't have that option.

In that, he is very alone.

From a hardware pov, there's not a lot you can do with it, unless you already have a half-decent understanding of the technology behind it.

The topics relating to computer hardware that kids should be taught - RAM installation, hard drive installation, partitioning, configuring an operating system for installation etc, etc, aren't applicable to the device.

In terms of what kids can learn from the software side of it? First of all it'll be running a linux variant - an OS kids, their parents, and I'd venture most of the staff running the I.T. lessons, are unfamiliar with. So you'd need to teach them to use an OS they're unlikely to use all that much in their working career [I spent ten years working in the field; the only time I had to deal with linux was when I had to do any updates to our VLE]. Then, once you've taught them to use said variant of Linux [alongside developing their Windows skills], you'd need to teach them how to programme.

**IF** Schools are planning to have a handful of these in the labs, then I can see the justification for buying them. Anymore than that, and you're better off buying a few secondhand PCs to be used for the hardware side of things, and letting the kids ""run wild"" inside a virtual host.",0,1331059230,null,0,false,0,c3yacq8,t3_qk3gg,t1_c3yacq8,t1_c3y9qrl,null,1428477870,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

His best work puts sympathetic ""killable"" extras (i.e. Sally Sparrow, ""mummy"") in danger. For an extra to be ""killable"" they need to be &gt;18 (because you know kids will almost certainly survive), non-recurring (you know only Rory can die, but he's came back so often you won't believe he's dead), and not historical (you knew Hitler wouldn't die in ""Let's Kill Hitler"", as much as you wanted him to). They also need to be sympathetic (&lt; 35, nothing like Hitler). 

One of the best parts of the Christopher Eccleston era was the girl of the week. Basically episode had a young woman (or maybe a young man) who had a ~50% chance of dying in the episode. It made the episodes a lot more scary.

Take ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"". You knew the kids would live. There was a chance the mother would sacrifice herself to save her kids, but it wasn't that concerning - you knew that if she did she'd be happy to go. So there's no real danger to most of the main characters.

Threatening the whole world is even worse. You've raised the stakes so high that any deaths will be OK, in the scheme of things. Any you *know* the world won't end in a TV series, especially if it's mid-season. 

""The Girl in the Fireplace"" just wasn't scary once you knew who the girl was. It was otherwise great, but it didn't have a plot, just a story. The basis of any plot in a horror flick is ""character dies"" or ""character lives"". For historical characters, you know that neither will really happen - they'll survive the monsters, then meet their pre-ordained fate.

I'll start with this;

&gt;I have a perspective too, you know - one free from an irrational notion such as nostalgia.

Football is full of nostalgia, it is engrained in every element of the sport, great clubs of the past now faded; WBA, Blackburn Rovers, Wolves etc all won titles years ago, all fans know this and hang on to it. Clubs with past full of glory trying to grab some glory in the modern era; Liverpool for example. It's what the fans talk about, it's what you remember , it's coming back from 3-0 down, it's in the rules, it's in the competitions it's in the pageantry; nostalgia is everywhere in football and I love the fact it's irrational, supporting a football club very often is.


But that is beside the point, Frank Lampard and John Terry are very much part of Chelsea of the now. John Terry is our club captain and his performance on the pitch, not just in his defending but in his leadership are immense. he is currently injured, but when fit will be back in the team as first choice centre back as he is the BEST we have, he may not be the best in the league but he is the best we have.

Frank who recently became the first player to score more than 10 goals in 9 consecutive seasons in the premier league, who has scored more goals than any other Chelsea player and made more appearances, who is the 8th highest scoring player in premiership history and only needs 5 or so more to take over revered strikers such as Michael Owen and Teddy Sheringham and just to show that this is not a nostalgia trip is currently our top scoring player in the league and in total.
 
They do not deserve to be called tumours by anyone, let alone someone who claims to support this club. 

joh terry as far as I know has never said anything bad about AVB publically, Franks comment were that the relationship ""was less than ideal"" hardly the most damning words said by a player about his manager. the people inside the game who have commented on this (Steve Claridge last night on the podcast i linked to earlier for one) have stated that this is very out of character for Frank and that to wind him up in this way something must be very awry.

AVB was in the right place at the wrong time, he's gone, end of. We need to move on and support our team, not be calling two of our most loyal and influential players tumours, if you don't like it, you are more than welcome to do one!

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; So lets say Billy / Billie the hypothetical teen, wants to get into computer hardware. How is [s]he going to get any realistic experience of that, using what's effectively, a system on a chip? From a hardware pov, there's not a lot you can do with it, unless you already have a half-decent understanding of the technology behind it.

Have a look at [this](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/411). As well as GPIO the core Pi board also has USB available. 

&gt; The topics relating to computer hardware that kids should be taught - RAM installation, hard drive installation, partitioning, configuring an operating system for installation etc, etc, aren't applicable to the device.

Presupposing that what *you* think should be taught, is what actually *should* be taught. Teaching kids to install RAM, partition a hard drive, configure an OS, is all well and good if you're trying to prepare them for a career as a sysadmin or a computer repair tech, but that isn't actually teaching kids computer science. 

But supposing your premise is right - if kids really should be learning that stuff first, then yes, I don't think the Pi would be a good place to start. 

&gt; In terms of what kids can learn from the software side of it? First of all it'll be running a linux variant - an OS kids, their parents, and I'd venture most of the staff running the I.T. lessons, are unfamiliar with.

Well, the primary language they are expecting the kids to work with is Python, so if the teaching staff can get used to python on an ""easy"" platform, then with a little effort they should be okay with whats on the Pi. 

&gt; IF Schools are planning to have a handful of these in the labs, then I can see the justification for buying them. Anymore than that, and you're better off buying a few secondhand PCs to be used for the hardware side of things, and letting the kids ""run wild"" inside a virtual host.

I don't understand the reasoning here, perhaps you could rephrase? You're saying that instead of spending, say, $700 on 20 Pi boards, you're better off getting a couple of second hand servers and installing virtualisation software?",0,1331062393,null,0,true,0,c3yazl1,t3_qk3gg,t1_c3yazl1,t1_c3yacq8,null,1428478169,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There's not a huge amount to do here if you're looking for a ""capital city"" experience as it's NOTHING like Sydney/Melbourne/Brisbane (can't speak for other Aussie cities as I've never been), but if you're only here for a day and a half, you'll find enough to do.

You mention you're a fan of Doctor Who - definitely do stuff related to that. http://www.doctorwholocations.net/ This site outlines where certain things are filmed in Cardiff, and as the city centre itself is really small you can easily walk around to all the locations in an hour but will probably take longer as you might want to take pictures etc. From the city centre you can catch the number 6 bus down to the bay (£3.20 for a daily ticket) and see the Millennium Centre, the entrance to Torchwood, a pretty Norwegian Church etc. I'd recommend having lunch at the bay as it's quite nice down there, but be aware that it's VERY windy most of the time and not so nice if it's wet/grey. If Cadwalader's ice cream is open and you like ice cream, I'd definitely give them a try as they have some of the best ice cream I've ever had.

Back in the city centre there's the big shopping centre called St. David's. It kind of sprawls and it's quite easy to get a bit confused as to where you are, but it's a nice shopping experience especially with the Aussie dollar being so strong right now. If the Cadwalader's down the bay is still shut (they're doing renovations at the moment and I'm not sure when they're re-opening), you can go to the one in the St. David's food court where you will see a random Muffin Break store. This surprised me when I first came here as most of the Muffin Breaks in Aus have shut down so it was a nice trip down memory lane! St. David's opens on to Queen Street which is the high street of Cardiff, and there's a decent amount of shops along there to take a look at.

Cardiff Castle is in the city centre but it's honestly not that amazing, especially if you have the opportunity to see some other castles on your road trip. It's definitely interesting to look at but I've been once and I'm not really sure I'd go again, this coming from a history buff.

If you find yourself bored in the evening, like Tractorman5720 says, the nightlife in St. Mary's St is kind of hilarious. I find the best time to explore is around 2-3am when people are stumbling home as there are many interesting specimens to behold.

As for changes to education - I'm actually advocating changes to the current curriculum, in the form of introducing skills that would actually be advantageous not only to kids looking to move into the I.T. industry, but to all kids - if they can all leave school, capable of performing simple tasks such as upgrading their PC, then surely that'll benefit them?

I'm not sure it's such a huge deal to me -- I don't really get that particular sense of tension from Doctor Who in general; I see it more as an adventure. Maybe it's because of shows like Dexter, but Who just doesn't give me that feeling of worry for any characters.

That said, some of the extras being killed off in the eccleston year didn't really have much impact to me. [spoiler](/s ""Suki""), for example, I didn't feel like we had much of a chance to make a connection with. [spoiler](/s ""Lynda with a Y"") just seemed sort of random. They tried to build a connection with that character, but the death was quick and never revisited.

The better ones for me have been those that the Doctor felt emotional about... [spoiler](/s ""Girl in the Fireplace, Voyage of the Damned, The Doctor's Daughter, and even The Doctor's Wife""). Moffat also has a few episodes that follow the formula of ""group of people in survival situation"" -- matt smith angel episodes, silurian episodes, flesh episodes, god complex. These offer chances to kill characters off, pretty much always, but again I pretty much expect some characters to die so it doesn't really turn into a big deal.

So, I'm not sure where that all really fits then. I think maybe character deaths don't do enough for me in general, so I just don't see how RTD's version was any better than Moffat's (or Moffat-as-head-writer).",0,1331065079,null,0,false,0,c3ybij1,t3_qjhvi,t1_c3ybij1,t1_c3yas4w,null,1435733817,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;...As well as GPIO the core Pi board also has USB available.

Putting the GPIO to one side for a second [I'll come back to it, fret not] - the USB ports are going to be utilised for the input devices. Unless you're suggesting using USB hubs? If so what would be the purpose, other than storage?

&gt;Presupposing that what *you* think should be taught, is what actually *should* be taught. Teaching kids to install RAM, partition a hard drive, configure an OS, is all well and good if you're trying to prepare them for a career as a sysadmin or a computer repair tech, but that isn't actually teaching kids computer science.

And herein, imo, lies the problem. If these devices are intended for Sixth Form students, who're actually studying computer sciences? That's perfectly fine. My understanding, is that people want these deployed as part of the GCSE [or even pre-GCSE] ICT Curriculum - i.e aimed at Kids 11 - 16. The curriculum should focus on practical skills - yes, by all means office suites, but also typing [I know that makes me sound like an old fart, but Christ alive the number of kids who can't type at anything approaching a decent rate of knots these days is amazing, especially as we're seeing, effectively kids who've grown up surrounded by computers all their lives], how to use the 'net properly, information on copyright issues [keep the Government happy!] and some more practical uses for ICT - how about how to keep a household budget, using excel, for example?

Then on the hardware side - again, the basics. How to create a restore point in Windows, how to back up a computer to an external HDD, imaging a device, restoring it etc, etc. Then upgrade skills. 

Teach those as the basics to pre GCSE level kids, and *then* if they're competent at all that, you could roll out devices like the Pi.

The comment about Python also falls under the above - if you're talking about deploying the device to pre GCSE students [11 - 14], then there's not a chance in hell most of 'em will be able to cope with that. GCSE level kids [14-16] possibly, and I'd agree for students taking Computer science qualifications who're in Sixth Form / College [16+]

&gt;I don't understand the reasoning here, perhaps you could rephrase? You're saying that instead of spending, say, $700 on 20 Pi boards, you're better off getting a couple of second hand servers and installing virtualisation software?

I'm saying, as devices to help children develop a fundamental understanding of computer hardware &amp; software, the Pi isn't an appropriate device. It'll only ""catch on"" with students who're already proficient with the basics.

Which is why, rather than spend $700 on pi boards, schools should get a few secondhand PCs [albeit with modern architecture] that kids can use to gain an understanding of computer hardware.

As for virtualisation, most schools have VLEs / MLEs running on servers that are more than capable of also running virtualisation software.

Maybe the beef with s5 and s6 is it's not really focused. It's not arc-driven like Lost - you don't get any real sense of progress in uncovering the arc. It's kind of like the X-Files (yes, all kinds of people will hate me for saying this) - the arcs are not interesting enough in their own right, and kind of distract from the rest of the episodes.

I loved the fireworks at the end of RTD seasons. Sure, they were trash, but they were fun. Daleks shouting at Cybermen, The Master, Davros ... it's a foregone conclusion that The Doctor will save the world with minimal casualties (via a Deus ex Machina), but it's cool.

But obviously if they threaten to put us all in the clink, or else level lawsuits at least... well, we won't want to, no, but we'll probably have to. Playing Devil's Advocate I can make an argument that if they choose to improve the service as their solution then it sets a precedent for them having to compete with piracy in the future, whereas making piracy illegal eliminates the competition. 

At this point I'd choose to switch sides and point out that those 'pirates' might be paying customers under better circumstances - then you get an argument concerning symptom vs cause. The piracy can in many cases be considered a symptom of a poor business model in the part of said business, a model that fails to take into account a great deal of consumerism's foremost tenets. 

My attitude? I once heard it argued that within capitalism spending is equivalent to the vote - a consumer is a voter, money is his ballot slip. In civilized society a party running for election attempts to win the hearts and minds of its voters, it doesn't threaten them saying 'vote for us or else!'.

&gt; Streaky Bacon &amp; Back Bacon - The french just don't do bacon unless it's belly pork thickness. Can't really make a sandwich out of it.

We have a saying in France that goes ""The whole of piggy is savoury"" (I needed to find something that rhymes) which roughly says that in the pig, everything's good to eat. You are quite right that we don't do bacon like you guys do, but if you manage to go to a proper butcher (and considering you live in the country side, that shan't be too hard to locate), you shall discover so many bits of the animal that could easily make you partially forget about bacon. 

&gt; Cheddar Cheese - ohhh the joy that's a doorstop thick cheddar cheese sandwich - Nothing remotely similar out here, so i make do with Gouda.

It's kind of a shame that, in country with more than 300 cheeses, you couldn't find better than Gouda :p Me not likey cheese so I can't suggest anything but seeing that my friends might spend hours discussing about the various cheeses we have, I would assume you could do better.

Perhaps some old Comté ?

Not to mention our wine... that said, I saw you guys drinking wine and you just don't get it. You drink it like it's beer. As fast and as tastelessly. 

&gt; English sliced wholemeal bread - to be fair, the french are slowly improving on their sliced bread, but it's still too stodgy and thin. Proper English sliced bread is fucking amaaaazing - nice thick slices, it toasts well, not to stodgy and has a wonderful taste with butter on it.

Definitely, we are bad at sliced bread... probably because we are so good at fresh bread. Funnily, I personally think that bread in very small villages in France is usually poor quality and totally uninteresting. However, in large cities, it has become so fashionable that bakers invent new kind of breads like Chefs. Some of them are just to die for with just a bit of butter on them. Obviously they won't compare to sliced bread since they are so different.

&gt; OXO Cubes - Nothing beats it. Nothing.

Never tried them so I'll have to take your word for it. I'd say nothing beats home made stock myself.

&gt; Being able to buy pita bread &amp; humus - i can make my own humus, but it's a chore to do now my food processor has packed up. Pita bread out here isn't the same either - and there's no wholemeal option.

I hear ya. I do miss Sainsbury's humus with lemon and fresh coriander. We now see more and more of humus but it's still not as ubiquitous as in Britain for sure.

&gt; British Sausages. We have such a variety in the UK, whereas the french have just two, and although they're nice, they're a bit overpowering.

Very true but that's also 'cos we don't gobble them by pack of 5 ;)

&gt; Black pudding - sliced and ready to fry - OMNOMNOMNOMNOM!

seriously? black pudding? never gotten that one.

&gt; Cheap packets of noodles - In the UK - 8p per pack. In France, 10x the price.

well noodles aren't common in our cuisine you see.

&gt; Porridge Oats - A bag of rolled oats in the UK is about £1. Here, the concept of humans eating oats is alien to the French - they regard it as Horse feed.

It's changed a bit thanks to organic shops like ""la BioCoop"" which offer a large variety of cereals which people happily try. But that's still quite uncommon indeed. I personally hate porridge... looks like vomit to me.

&gt; Colemans English Mustard - Don't get me wrong, Dijon is nice, but nothing beats clearing out your sinuses &amp; setting your nostrils on fire when you use Colemans ;)

Sure, if you use mustard to clear up your nose... :p

We have very lovely granary mustard though. Rather mild and slightly sweet.

&gt; Ribena - blackcurrant cordial that's not Ribena just doesn't taste quite right. The alternatives are all far too sweet.

Yeah squash flavours are very sweet in France.

&gt; Golden Syrup - 'nuff said.

What's wrong with lovely honey that we produce in so many varieties?

&gt; Takeaways &amp; Fast Food

Well shall I daresay we haven't given in to them and still love our cuisine. I believe you guys have also a traditional one but you either cook it only at Xmas or simply don't do it in pubs anyway any longer. I discovered many great cuisines when I lived in Britain but I've seldom managed to eat your own. Though nothing can beat a gammon and chips really.

We have crappy curry places mostly unfortunately which what I miss the most from takeaways.



As for the shops not being opened 24h, I won't lie, it didn't take long for me to get used to it. When I came back it took me a while to revert back and I was annoyed as well. At the same time it also ensures we, as a nation, value that the time you spend with your family and friends is not one when you consume stuff you don't need. I still find annoying but also quite good overall.

Finally what I dearly miss? The pubs. We can't do them. Even when British folks open them down here, they aren't the same. They are mostly bars. We have great bars, cosy ones, some have great mood but I've yet to find any that has the pub atmosphere. Value it guys!

true,kr239,eng-eastsusex,Portslade,"You can get english cuts of bacon from the butchers, but they're SO expensive. The local intermarche sells english things - but again, a packet of 6 rashers is €5! Consider that in the UK, you get 24 for about the same price in Iceland.

I have some comte in the fridge now. It's a very poor substitute. With comte, there's just one type, and it tastes a little like emmental, too bitter, not enough fat content to be a good melting cheese either, so it's crap for cheese on toast. No option of mature, mild, extra strong like cheddar either. Cheddar is the quintessential everyman of the cheese world. 

Bread - well, we agreed on the sliced stuff - some of the bakers own stuff is nice, but you guys make batch loaves like concrete, with crusts thicker than tarmac that wreck your jaw when you try and eat it as a sandwich. Only really good toasted. And you don't do wholemeal. At all. Anywhere. 

Sausages are one thing i do love. I love french sausages too, but they're overpowering, too big and you can't do a decent toad in the hole with them. You seem to have two types. With onion &amp; herbs (Alsace), or without. Or those annoying little chipolata's which turn into charcoal if not cooked to perfection. Merguez are okay, but only really for casseroles. 

Yes - black pudding. French boudin noir are too soft - but then English black pudding uses oats. Which you don't eat. Unless you're a horse :P

Noodles aren't really our national cuisine either - but they're student food, and ideal for those on a low income, so they're popular. The French seem to regard them as wierd 'foreign' stuff. 

There is a BioCoOp in St. Malo, but to go all that way for one or two things is a little excessive. If i'm there doing something else, i may pop in, but the junction where it's situated is known as 'suicide alley', and despite the fact i've lived here for years, and i'm a pretty good driver, i'd rather not risk it if i have to!

I like wholegrain mustard, and dijon - but again, toad in the hole or british sausages work best with colemans - loaaaads of heat and flavour. I find dijon a bit vinegar-ey (vinegerie? sod it - you know what i mean!). 

Honey != Golden Syrup. Golden syrup is inverted refiners syrup, has totally different properties for cooking with, different boiling points, different structure - honey just can't take it's place, nor can granulated sugar. 

English cuisine is far more varied than i think you give us credit for, but for a lot of people traditional foods have been replaced, with other things, like spaghetti bolognese, lasagne, chicken tikka masala and pizza. 

It's not about giving in either - a lot of people, myself included, like the convenience of a takeaway, where you're not sat in an uncomfortable chair waiting for grumpy/rushed staff, and where you don't feel rushed. I like being able to pick up a kebab, or a burger, or fish &amp; chips, chinese/indian etc and go home and eat it at my own pace. France doesn't do non-french foods very well. And all the kebab places i see are okay, but still not quite right (they STILL don't use pita. Or Humus.).

The 24 hour shopping is a massive convenience though - it's not like you HAVE to use it - but not everyone keeps the same hours, or has a large family to come home to (like me). If on a sunday, i go to the fridge and find i've run out of milk - i'm screwed until 9:30am on Monday.

If anything I say provokes an eyebrow into rising past a pre-determined point then I've obviously tested positive.

This assumes the level of contamination was not such that I opted to eschew said treatment. If I were to eschew the treatment I have a verbal contract in place with five reliable fellows who have instructions to abduct and force the treatment on me (with all reasonable quarantine procedures in effect).

true,SEMW,null,null,"&gt; terms of service tend to be regularly struck down in courtrooms, because a company can't just put anything in there and it's automatically enforceable beyond question

It's a contract. Everything in there is enforceable by default. You can get a term declared unenforceable if it's unfair (that is, ""[causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations... to the detriment of the consumer](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2083/regulation/5/made)""), and certain types of clauses are always invalid (e.g. ones which [exclude liability for death or injury from negligence](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50)).

You can try arguing that a term saying you're responsible for not letting randomers breach copyright on your connection is unfair if you like. But you'll fail. Cos it's not.

And no, finding an unenforceable clause (in a valid contract) does *not* mean that the whole terms of service is ""struck down"". *That particular clause* is rendered unenforceable. The rest of it still is. 

&gt;  I know my Virgin fiber-optic has no ToS about ""WiFi must be encrypted"", ""Only authorised users may be granted access"", or similar

Try [reading it](http://www.virgin.net/terms/broadband_tc.html).

F1n: ""you will not ... use the Service other than for your personal use.""

Also, F1b: ""you will not ... upload, download ... material which is ... in breach of ... copyright [, or] F1t: permit any third party to do any of the above"".

No. The courts can't just strike down a statutes if they don't like it. That's not how our legal system works. This isn't America.

If Parliament doesn't like a court ruling, they can pass a law to overrule it, and that's that - [the courts have to apply it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty).

I was pleasantly surprised, I found the story cheeky and whimsical and very Adams-esque, despite it conforming to certain realms of reality that the makers clearly had to adhere to in order to make the show affordable and make-able.

I think Stephen Mangan is a great actor, and although I don't feel this is his most comfortable role, I think he is an excellent choice - considering he was up against my preconceived literary Dirk (and he was QUITE different) he held the role with a nice blend of comedic and necessary straight delivery.

Darren Boyd is fantastic as MacDuff and in light of his recent exposure in such a variety of shows recently, still managed to be 'MacDuff' and avoid becoming a typecast.

Great supporting roles too, particularly from Paul Ritter, made this a very funny, distinctly DA-esque slice of entertainment.

true,jetRink,null,null,"&gt;How well a car is advertised has as much of an affect on the price it is sold for as the actual quality.

The logical conclusion, if this is true, is an arms race in advertising and decline in or neglect of product quality. And yet when we look at cars today, they are better built than ever and advertising remains a small percentage of the overall price. Ford's research budget is $8 billion and its advertising budget is $1 Billion. They aren't spending $8 billion researching how to make cars fall apart faster.

&gt;Therefore the manufacturer is better off making a car that doesn't last as long in the hope they will get twice as many sales in the same period.

This is a losing strategy. People don't return to brands that fall apart on them. American automakers got into trouble in the '80s and '90s when they became complacent and allowed quality to decline. (The same is true of British automakers in the '60s and '70s). People took notice and started buying foreign cars, mostly Toyotas, which were renowned for their longevity. The focus of the last ten years for American automakers has been improving quality and convincing the consumer that they have done so.

Also, resale value matters for consumers. Even if they intend to buy new cars in five years, they don't want their old cars going to the crusher. Most people expect to resell their cars for 25-50% of the initial price at 60 months, which is not a small amount of money.",0,1331074070,null,0,true,0,c3yd4tj,t3_qk162,t1_c3yd4tj,t1_c3ycnr3,null,1428479180,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not that doing so solves everything, just that it can help to lead by example.

I think it's also worth noting that creating those kinds of in-depth discussion topics takes quite a bit of time. And it's simply not realistic to be able to do that every day. So in order to keep a subred active there has to be a mix of both types. Unless you're unemployed, disabled, home sick or underage you probably don't have that much time in a day to commit to the internet. Let alone every week.

Posting an image macro can be done quickly. Posting analysis or critique means some research, organizing your thoughts clearly, possibly having to include resource links or examples. 

For example, it took me about an hour each to research and draft up [Questions about Donna's timeline](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/qghfq/donna_theres_something_on_your_back_and_im/), and verify the Weeping Angles back  story plus fact check historical points for [Discussion of the Weeping Angels](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/qhwwx/the_weeping_angels_killing_kindly_or_a_fate_worse/). And that was a bit of an anomaly for me, time wise. I have a bunch of ideas for discussion but it's unlikely I'll be able to continue to devote that kind of time on a regular basis, so those ideas have to wait on the back burner.

**TL;DR:** peeps is busy and have a life outside the internet, so we get the quick light stuff more often than the longer heavy stuff.

Energy, winning 50/50 balls, A WIN, 2 goals, solid defense from Cahill and Luiz, a really good shift from Bertrand, 4-2-3-1, and Ramires looks to be sharpening up...back to what we've come to expect. 

Negatives:

We looked a bit sloppy (although this may have actually worked to our advantage), finishing was poor, Birmingham weren't great today...they didn't look full-strength, Sturridge didn't look great and Lampard looked worse.

Overall: Put in a good shift, a little bit of desire is back but we need to build on this. The real test is gonna be if we can kick it up a notch. We have some big games up ahead.

There's no category link that I can find to list them together, there's no handy tag link to click, and the search feature spits out results without the actual character name in the title.

100% of taxes can not be spent on regenerating the poorest areas of the country.  Sure a lot should in an attempted to improve the broken fragmented society that is currently in place, but just throwing money at a problem isn't the only solution.  People are still far better off monetarily now (even at the lowest end of the scale) than they were in say 1942, yet we did not have the social problems then that we do now. I have no idea what the fix is, but throwing money certainly isn't the problem. Labour tried it for 13 years.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I was very, very impressed with the back four. Bertrand was fantastic, Ivanovic was as well, Cahill was solid, and Luiz was my man of the match. He was everywhere at once and fantastic at the back.

Mata was a lifesaver, but he scares me because he is so damn tiny. It is obvious that opposing team's strategies are to body him up and play him rough, and it works to some extent. He gets thrown off the ball so easy, but it is tough to get him too frazzled cause he's always got that trickery up his sleeve.

Torres had a fantastic game and deserved a goal. Obviously he fluffed his chance, but I was impressed with his outing. Looks like he had a new motivation under Di Matteo, and he ran like a mad man to prove it.

Mikel was fantastic. Excellent vision downfield, and he was a rock in midfield. Had a few excellent defensive saves in our box as well.

Meireles had an unbelievable goal, but I still didn't think he had that great of a game. He had some good distribution and he was always pressuring the ball, but he still wasted a ton of long balls over the top to no one in particular. I'm glad he's got the idea straight (ball over the top to Torres = feed the beast), but the execution was pretty pathetic for the most part.

Kalou was clearly rusty to start the game, but he came into his own a bit in the second half. He just needs to play more. I feel bad for him because he rarely gets the opportunities to play, and he's constantly trying to get back in the swing of things. I would far rather play Kalou than Malouda though. Younger and much more upside if he got the playing time.

So glad Ramires signed a long term contract. He absolutely lights up the game every time he plays.

&gt;The UK government did not give sufficient consideration to the wider impacts of closing the Forensic Science Service, an MPs' inquiry has concluded.

&gt;Implications for criminal justice, research and evidence archives were ""hastily overlooked"" for financial reasons, the report argues. 

Here is said report, also linked on site, but for ze sake of convenience here's a direct link to the report pdf file

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/855/855.pdf

Then there's also these raised concerns

&gt;Andrew White, the chief executive of the Hertfordshire police authority, said he had no choice but to sign off new contracts without doing the usual due diligence after being told that if they were not in place by the middle of July, there would be no access to forensic services in October. ""This was not considered an option,"" he said.

I admit I didn't previously see that long-form Virgin ToS, only the fine print on the paper contract (which contains none of that info, unless it was recently added to new accounts). However, I realise that the entire ToS is never struck down; I was referring to portions of it being unreasonable (is it not possible to argue that preventing an end-user from hosting an open network, something many routers do by default, would be an unfair restriction? What if it was secured, but a rogue passerby obtained the password by conducting a brute-force attack? It's not reasonable to then hold the contract-holder responsible for the contents of the attack on their network, including copyright infringement or otherwise. That's hardly ""permitting a third party to do so"").

The only consequences of a ToS breach are the premature end of the contract, anyway: you could always take your business elsewhere, so it's really not the end of the world.

As for ""it's not America"" (which it, indeed, appears not to be out there) UK law is still sometimes found unenforceable, isn't it? I'm struggling to remember examples but I think can I recall certain controversial acts, or portions of them, being challenged in the courts. Apologies for how vague that sounded.

To get back to my original point - even if all the above you've said is true, this isn't about civil liability (very limited as it is) to comply with the ToS, in the original context it's about criminal liability for copyright infringement when such a three-strikes letter is received.  
My point was that there is no obligation in criminal law to secure a wireless network, so although you are probably correct that almost any ISP could justify dropping you as a customer scot-free over it, the rest of the letter is saying ""stop, or face criminal action"". But the part about controlling access is amiss to that, there won't be any criminal action over people ignoring the ToS and running open networks, so a government-agency letter shouldn't mention an obligation to act.",0,1331089037,null,0,false,0,c3yfoaa,t3_qk0n4,t1_c3yfoaa,t1_c3yczwa,null,1428480379,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There are too many plot points left unexplained, which makes it difficult to follow the story. I love the complexity, but wish there was a lighter tone in the show. The latest story arcs we've seen, I feel alienate certain viewers who aren't as quick to figure things out or get confused easily. 
Back to the topic at hand: I found myself wondering what the TARDIS room was in the Lodger and why they needed it (in season 6). As for the TARDIS exploding, I did not get that, but the paradox theory seems fitting when you think about it. Then I'd like a bit of a clearer explanation of the River Song timeline because I still don't understand it completely. Why is River a Timelord? Why the Silence? Why can't his name be revealed? How does River know the Doctor's name if that's not what he told her at the end of season 6? I'd just like a bit more emphasis on the doctor's character and less on these convoluted story lines. Twists are great if they aren't ridiculous, but I feel that Moffat writes only to make things difficult. I especially love certain things being up to interpretation, but there's a limit. I want to spend more time loving the doctor's adventures and less time trying to piece together a puzzle.

true,Marfan42,null,null,"I definitely thing that his name has some sort of huge significance. It almost makes me think that Moffat will never tell us. If it's such a powerful name that it's the question that can never be answered, it obviously has some serious ramifications if it is said. 

In one episode River says ""There's a lot of power in a name"" It's assumed that she's talking about her own name, since either in that episode or the next we find out the whole twist with her name and identity. But we don't know where she is on her timeline, she could have already heard the Doctor's name and been there while the whole universe went crazy with the consequences. Who knows exactly what it will do, but the consequences will be bad. 

But it kind of makes you wonder, because if the Doctor's name is indeed the answer to the question that must never be answered, then something about the nature of the answer or its consequences must change at some point. (I know that sentence was vague, but play along) River says it to him in the library, at the end of her life. Yes, she whispers it, but she still says it. So the power must have been taken from the words in some way. Or there's some time lord craziness going on that makes River able to say it without any craziness happening. Or, River didn't actually tell him his name in the library. I find that highly doubtful, because then why would he trust her in the library, and why would he interrogate her about knowing his name? But now I've fallen down the rabbit hole. 

I think his name has the power to disrupt the nature of time, or something like that. The time lords hold such power, and there is so much power in names. Time lord's true names have to hold so much power that even time lords gone rogue (like the Master) dare not use it's power. After all, this question that must never be answered is what's at the root of all the problems of the past two seasons. It will have to have some serious timey-wimey consequences.

true,Twirrim,sussex,Sussex,"3 1/2 years ago I moved to the US (Hawaii).  I met my wife who is from Hawaii (but not Hawaiian.. important distinction) back 6 years ago and eventually I moved her and married her.  We thought long and hard on the subject but in the end I decided to move here rather than her coming to the UK even though it was a decidedly more expensive move.

It's okay.. Hawaii has it's perks :D .  It rains a fair bit, actually a little bit more than back home, but on the plus side it's almost always in the 80s, and it's a stunningly beautiful place.  The people here are great, the atmosphere is a lot different from the mainland, much more island culture where things take their time and happen when they happen.

That said I think I'd move back to the UK in a flash.  I miss my family, and I miss my friends, even as I've made a good life for myself and gained new friends and become part of my wife's family.

It's still not quite the same.

The politics drives me crazy, and the level of ignorance of the world is unbelievable.

I miss a good Indian curry (not many good places here), Kebabs, or Fish &amp; Chips.

Attitudes towards workers is flat out bizarre.  Unions have crazy amounts of power (at least in the government sector), too much and that's speaking as an ardent believer in the necessity of unions, and yet working conditions here are shockingly poor.

No mandated holiday, no maternity leave, Hawaii is one of the few states that mandates companies to provide health insurance for workers (but only those who work more than 20 hours a week).

Health care is another crazy thing.  Until I got to my current provider we had terrific problems trying to get our insurer at the time to cover even the most trivial of things.  Our current provider is by far the best in the state.

I miss pub culture, which came as a bit of a surprise to me.  I also really miss the British sense of humour and general attitudes to life.

Maybe someday this place will fell like home, but I'm not convinced.",0,1331101225,null,0,true,0,c3yhnuh,t3_qk1vv,t1_c3yhnuh,t3_qk1vv,null,1428481399,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Look, I have been a member of reddit for just over a year now, and yeah, in that time, I've read a lot of posts. But all of them have one thing in common.  They are all different (except the reposts, although the comments are still different, so it counts).

The whovians shouldn't vote down this thread because it's complaining about the state of the subreddit.

/r/doctorwho is a locomotive that runs on us.

The only kharma whores in this subreddit are the trolls that I like to call fear, over-criticism, self-doubt and the dangers of drinking too much and posting on the internet.

Because the real problems aren't the content that makes up this subredit.  There's no such thing as universally pleasing content, and even if there was, serious Doctor Who news and discussion might still find a second life on /r/gallifrey

And I will tell you why, this subreddit is a community of fans of the show, and those fans like things about the show that aren't actually the show. Also, Harrison Ford is irradiating our testicles with microwave satellite transmissions.

So maybe we are caught in an endless cycle of meta-posts, vague show references and show-related merchandise demonstrations.

Maybe Donna also has that information trapped in her brain. 

We know a few Time Lord names and they've been said in the presence of humans, so I don't think they're powerful enough to kill. Plus the Doctor doesn't even seem to know what's going to happen himself. He had no idea what the question was, and when he's finally told it he looks annoyed and slightly uneasy, like he knows something's coming just over the horizon but he's not sure what. Moffat has given us hints, but I don't know if they even apply because...he's Moffat. I'm thinking specifically of ""We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean?""

I think the Doctor hides his name because he wants to distance himself from his people as much as possible. He's always been running. Whether it's from Gallifrey itself or something that happens is something the writers may never tell us. But he stole the TARDIS and ran. Was elected Lord President and ran.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"I don't hate rich people, I even have a few friends that I would classify as rich (earning over £150k) that are good people making difficult choices the same as anyone else, but they shouldn't be presented as victims. Especially not in a system that provides them with security forces, labour and a population educated enough to read the sign that says ""keep out"". The rich aren't victims, they are almost always benefactors in everything; every shady deal, every big event it is the richest 20% that own 80% of the wealth (this is just a pareto distribution, things are probably worse than this now).

A rich person is not smarter than you; they don't not have a genetic predisposition for being so and the myth that its hard work that gets you there is completely unreal. Most people that are rich were born rich; they were never victims of society they are the benefactors. You get a few rags to riches stories but they're just that mean middle classes are willing to work dull middle management jobs for their entire life. These people on £50k aren't rich; if we look at tax they are still net ""gainers"" over the people that earn over £100k and such (the net ""losers"" in the tax game).

Going back a bit; are the rich really net losers? They work build a business ""empire"" and then have 50% of their pay taken (above a damn high threshold) it works out that they would get services cheaper (like healthcare and schools) if they paid for it, maybe. But this is ignorant, to me, because it ignores the fact that we have universities generating ideas, schools educating the workforce of tomorrow, a huge transport network and a police force and Army protecting *their* wealth. The western world is a world for the rich.

I can excuse individual cases of crime or brutality but I will not accept that the rich are anything close to victims in society. The entire concept is paradoxical. We can view it through the narrow band of taxes but this isn't morality its just economics; in reality the massive wealth divides limit our social mobility and relegate people before they even have a chance at life.

true,Syeknom,eng-Cornwall,"Cornwall (expatriate, living in Belgium)","I moved to Leuven, Belgium 2 and a half years ago. My reason for moving was that I finished my bachelor's degree and wanted to continue my studies for a master's. With top-up fees having been introduced during my university time, I was unwilling to pay £3,500 for the year's tuition. I learned about some universities in Belgium that taught masters in computer science in English and tuition here is only €550. I already had a group of Belgian and Dutch friends living here so I moved in with them. Told myself I'd go home after my degree but ended up loving it here and staying. Now I've got a well paying job in Brussels, a wealth of cultural experience and stories, am rapidly gaining proficiency in Dutch and have an incredible Belgian girlfriend.

Belgium is a lovely country - the cities are beautiful, the chocolate is unbelievable, the streets are clean and safe (except in Brussels) and I hang out with people from all over the world. Also, Belgian women are beautiful. :)

That said, I miss the UK a lot and feel that Belgium is lacking in many regards to home. kr239 covered an awful lot of the things I miss! Supermarkets and food being a big one. The lack of musical culture here too (especially compared to Bristol - that city has dozens of amazing gigs all over the place every week!). The biggest thing I miss is how friendly English people are (at least in the south-west) compared to Belgians. I find Belgians terribly rude and brusque to strangers, and somewhat lacking in a sense of humour and fun. Once you get to know them however they are lovely people!

That said, whenever I come back to the UK I immediately remember the things I don't like about it (do bear in mind this is only based on the south-west: Bristol and Cornwall). The people are friendly as hell but also never stop complaining. Public transport is a nightmare compared to Belgian. City centres are becoming dominated with pound lands, payday loan shops, pawn shops, off-licenses and betting shops. People dress *terribly* (jogging bottoms everywhere!) and are (to me) so much less attractive than in Belgium. Absolutely shitfaced fat girls falling around in the street wearing almost no clothes and vomiting? No thanks. Also the violence - I've never once seen violence in Leuven, but every time I visit Bristol or Truro centre I see something going on. This year when I went back I watched a guy kick off in a chicken shop at 9pm and get his face kicked in by three security guards. He then stood up and started swinging at them again, which ended in another savage beating. Hilarious, but still.

I do not plan to stay in Belgium forever - as much as I love being here and how comfortable I feel it is just not somewhere I will settle down permanently. However, I'm not sure I want to move back to the UK either (except perhaps London at some point). There'll be some decision making in my future.",0,1331112744,null,0,false,0,c3yitvn,t3_qk1vv,t1_c3yitvn,t3_qk1vv,null,1428481952,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think the Daleks are set to return in Series 7. I'd actually hold them off for another year - have Series 7 Dalek-free. Not only does it build the hype and anticipation for their eventual return, but if they're used for the 50th anniversary, then it would be a fitting way to re-introduce them. The first time we've seen the Daleks in two years, they're returning *en masse*, bigger, badder, more deadly than ever...the Doctor is left with no option but to call on his past regenerations to help him out. 

That said, I remember Moffat going on the record saying that since the Daleks are the Doctor's biggest enemies, he's got to defeat them every time. I disagree with Moffat on a lot of things, but I couldn't agree more on that. So I do really applaud the decision to rest the Daleks for Series 6 (even if he couldn't resist teasing us in ""The Wedding of River Song"").

That's more then i make in a day...  Anyhow for him to work at the level of his qualifications he works all over the world, and lives in London.  That's where the big IT jobs are in the UK.  

If you work in the lower ranks of IT then you can pretty much work in any of the bigger cities.  I moved from Canada 5 years ago and moved to North Wales.  It is a quiet place times seems to have forgot.  I'd say it is 30 years behind any Canadian city, but the people are friendly, with a live and let live kind of attitude that is hard to find.  However making a living is very difficult, it is the poorest area of the UK i'm sure.  But alas this is where my girlfriend wants to be.  

I came with about 20K, and set up a small woodworking business, since that is my trade, but I will never get anywhere financially.  I went from between $5000-10,000 Canadian a month to not even earning enough to pay taxes here in the UK.  

Just be prepared, or pre-warned.  Things are not what they used to be here in the UK.  The money is in the centers, and most of that is in the financial service sector, while it looks good on paper, the reality on the ground is entirely different.

true,[deleted],null,null,"For shops I would totally just recommend wandering the north laine / south lanes and see what you can find. There's tons of decent places hidden away and it kinda spoils the fun to just tell you. :D

As for places to eat, I would recommend [Pompoko](http://www.pompoko.co.uk/) for good, fair priced Japanese food.

The next recommendation requires it's own paragraph:

The shitloads of awards winning [BBQ Shack](https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBQ-SHACK/120684347953710?sk=info) (facebook page since their main site is down). This is, hands-down, the best barbecue food I have ever eaten. I apologise if you're vegetarian / vegan, but this shit is the best. All of their food is slow cooked for 18 hours, it's fucking gorgeous, maybe a little pricey, but worth every penny. They do a menu in [The World's End](http://www.drinkinbrighton.co.uk/worlds-end) (don't much like that pub, to be honest, seen too many street drinkers there) and a reduced menu in [The Globe](http://www.drinkinbrighton.co.uk/globe). If you give them a call you can arrange an order for pick up in the World's End if you want to eat at home. 

The following is a description of an Armadillo Egg that they sell. It's a Jalapeno stuffed with cream cheese. This is then wrapped in spicey, slow cooked sausage meat and the whole lot is wrapped in bacon. Served in a bun with salad and some chilli peppers and their own home made barbecue sauce. [Fuck. Yeah.](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=332271066811622&amp;set=a.332270513478344.73626.323526954352700&amp;type=3&amp;theater)

Anyway, getting sidetracked there. For cocktails, give [Valentino's](http://www.elmexicano.co.uk/valentino.html) a try, friendly staff, really nice atmosphere, but it is a cocktail bar, so it will be a bit pricey.

For pubs, there's a good deal of them around. My local is [The Colonnade](http://www.goldenliongroup.co.uk/bars-and-pubs/colonnade-bar), lovely staff, usually a nice quiet environment to sit down and have a few pints. Being next-door to the Theatre Royal it gets a lot of theatre traffic, so if there's a show in, it'll be completely rammed until the show goes on (usually 7pm-7:45pm it's rammed), but then clear out to a nice, quieter calm after that.
[The Pull And Pump](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/47/4739/Pull_and_Pump/Brighton) is another nice little pub, usually has several decent ales on the go and a ridiculously large selection of tequilla. The food there is also pretty good.

Food wise there is a lot of choice Piccolos is a really good pizza place cheap too. Pho is a awesome Vietnamese style restaurant. If you like curry the unofficial best place in Brighton is Raj Pavilion in Preston Circus which is amazing. There is a good Thai place there called Circus Circus as well which is also a nice pub. Round the corner near London Road station is the The Signalman, it's my local and a great pub does really good Sunday Roast but you need to get in early. The Office is another good Thai place in the North Laine area.

true,umbama,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;*Every time some piece of shit plastic crap made by an exploited economic underclass in the land of who gives a shit*

The poor in the developing world get lifted out of poverty by participating in the world economy, not through well-intentioned charity. If you know some means of doing this *other* than by Capitalism then please share it with us. 

&gt;*an intelligent and sustainable pattern of  economical consumption*

Again, you've confused GDP with resource consumption. This is simply economically illiterate. 

&gt;[**Gross domestic product (GDP) refers to the market value of all officially recognized final goods and services produced within a country in a given period**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)


Here's a real world comparison. During its entire history the Soviet Union didn't increase total factor productivity *at all* and **all** its growth came from increased resource usage. During the same period, in the market economies of the West, 80% of  growth was acheived through productivity improvements and only 20% from increased resource usage.

You know a better way to pull people out of poverty, let's hear about it. You want to keep people in grinding poverty, have the balls to say that's what you'd wish upon all those brown people overseas whose godawful plight doesn't spoil your sleep.

I also spent 6 months in Turkey and 2 months in Grand Cayman but I don't think that should really count as living.

What I found was that working in a multi-national company was good in that I got to see different places, but because I was always flying somewhere or flying back from somewhere I didn't feel as though I integrated. I mean I really wanted to love Switzerland, but I couldn't, which is why I moved around so much. By contrast I lived in Bonn in the 80s for a couple of years and that was really good, but everyone was nervous as to what the wall coming down would mean and whether or not the free travel of east germans to the west would create an influx of ossi refugees.

Monaco was stupidly expensive for what it was. I didn't really like it and moved back to Switzerland. I rented a small apartment for about a year and must've spent less than 3 solid months in it due to travel. Also getting the train to Nice so you can get the plane to London is a PITA, and there's no decent nearby transport hub (you have to go to Avignon or Turin to get to the rest of europe by train, or to Nice, Turin or Cannes to fly anywhere decent in Europe).

Brisbane was probably the best place I've lived out of the UK, but most of the work was in Canberra or Edmonton. When I was out there you do get very detached from the UK, it feels like the UK is another planet far away.

Turkey had very friendly people, but you had to watch what you said to whom depending on who they are.

true,DubaiCM,null,null,"I moved to the Middle East, specifically the United Arab Emirates, about 4 years ago. I moved because I was offered a senior position in an engineering consultancy and the package was too good to turn down. I was interested in working abroad anyway to broaden my experience so when the opportunity came up, I took it.

I would like to come back to the UK eventually. I don't see myself staying here permanently but I am enjoying life here for now so I expect to be here for another year or two.

Things I miss:

* The weather. Blue skies and sunny weather becomes a bit monotonous after a while. I crave an English sky with clouds and some drama, not knowing if it will be sunny or raining later on. 
* Diversity and liberalism. There is diversity here in terms of nationality but generally attitudes tend to be rather conservative. I was back in London recently and I saw girls with pink hair, performance art on the street, and gay people holding hands. I miss that willingness to be open, creative and expressive. It does exist here but it in London it is more mainstream.
* Real ale on draught. You can get bottled ales here but not on hand pump.
* Quality live music. You get a few touring bands passing through and there are dozens of cover bands but you don't get the eclectic brilliance of London's live music scene.

Having said that, part of the point of travelling is experiencing a different life to the one you are used to. If the world was the same all over, it would be a very boring place so I like the fact it is different here. 

Things I don't miss:

* Violence and crime: This country is very safe and I have seen maybe one fight in four years. Compare this to UK where I saw fights every weekend, pickpockets were rife and burglaries were common. I can leave the door to my house unlocked here and no one would even think of coming in. I still lock my car, which my neighbours think is one of my ""English quirks"". My female friends can walk home at night and not get bothered, whereas in London they were too scared to do this and would take expensive taxis instead.
* Taxes. Self explanatory!

Maybe it wasn't the best dressing room ever...big woop.Think how many times this season we saw basic basic errors being made on the pitch. Momentary lapses of concentration killing us after playing well for most of the  match. Also think of how many times we were genuinely, genuinely, unlucky. The end result was poor performance and the sacking of a manager. A million theories pop up as to what power struggles led to our teams decline. I didn't really see it. Things could have very easily gone a different way.

In a way my gripe with Lampard and some of the other older players has not been their attitude, but their performance. Plain and simple. This wasn't new to AVB by any means. We saw the same lapses in concentration, inconsistency, and underwhelming play under Ancelotti. For me the bulk of the blame lies on the board. They didn't do their homework. We paid 50 mil for Torres, missed out on a whole bunch of talent (Modric, Pastore, Willian, Lucas Moura etc...) and we had no backup plan. It was clear as day from last year we needed a class CM this season. We never got it. 

The Torres thing I don't know what to think. I think he made the right call, Mata is the designated PK, this is a time where we just need to get to basics and focus, not worry about whatever. I don't think Torres would be lighting it up for the rest of the season just because he scores a pen against Bham. 

And yes Torres has been contributing in many areas and doing really well for the team...but...he did that for a good period when Drogba was gone and we still didn't win. So your right, he just needs to plant his ass in front of the net and start scrapping goals. We have actually improved  our chance creation from last season, we now need to start putting them away.

Most people earning wealth are doing so by impoverishing others.

Organised sport is generally useless money, it provides no source of wealth  generation for the general population, and is little more than exploitation of tribalism or nationalism for state gain. What people need is land, resources, and the space to make a living for themselves. We need water that isn't medicated or filled with chlorine, food that isn't in the precarious situation of being flown in from 1000s of miles away and pegged to oil prices, and houses fit for purpose. People want meaning to their lives, not bread and circuses. The olympic games is a vanity project and sheer hypocrisy in a time of austerity. Have you even looked at the figures detailing where the money has gone and how some* buildings will not be sustainable, instead needing further handouts in the future?

Re: the royal family (small r) anyone with an ounce of fairness should be against such an institution in principle: legal privilege, a ridiculous land 'share' if you look to the Crown estate and 500 km^2 for Charles Windsor (who can't actually make that land profitable instead receives government funding, and who's income tax is discretionary).",0,1331134236,null,0,true,0,c3yks9d,t3_qkmbu,t1_c3yks9d,t1_c3yeils,null,1428482872,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

SWIM (somebody who isnt me) did mdma at Cindies (a shit club), once around town in the day during may week, and once at a house party. SWIM once did LSD in The Anchor and Botanical Gardens.

I noticed no drugs in my first year. In second year I found that weed is kind of prevalent. Certain demographics who you may expect to have weed will probably have weed. 

I've seen somebody dealing cocaine, ive been asked for cocaine and ive been offered cocaine during my time here. Only once for all of those though. (I would never do cocaine, its not my style.)

Then in 3rd/fourth year I found the types of parties where you meet people on mdma. SWIM's friendship group also started trying it out. Not too often though. 

You wont likely find people who do anything unless you seem like the type of person who is cool about it, or is rumoured to have tried it. Then people may come out of the woodwork a little if they do weed and like you.

Music taste seems to be a good indicator of drug use.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"There are loads of companies looking for good programmers. The problem is CS courses are not a good indication of programming ability in general.

It is a weird paradox. If your degree matters then the quality of your degree matters. If you are doing something irrelevant to your work then it doesn't matter if the degree is rubbish. However for programming we'd rather take a Physics graduate with his head screwed on than a CS graduate who's incapable (we have actually done this).

For instance we had a CS graduate who believed C arrays are 1 indexed (he claimed C experience). Now I imagine he had a professor who thought 1 indexing was the one true way and allocated an extra space. Thus hordes of students were incorrectly taught C arrays are 1 indexed.

We have a 3 hour interview process. If you have a decent grade in CS you'll probably get in. However you will be tested before you get a job and lots of CS graduates haven't got it. Also if you claim more experience than you actually have then you can stuff it up even if you are good enough to get picked. if you say you are wonderful at C and don't know that C arrays are 0 indexed then your interview will probably be very short.

BTW I'm a CS grad from a relatively mediocre university. I got my job because I did lots of side projects and could speak in detail about vast quantities of non-CS degree material.",0,1331140936,null,0,true,0,c3ylzsa,t3_qltjf,t1_c3ylzsa,t1_c3ylfj2,null,1428483440,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The two mysteries in that episode are what the Doctor saw in his room (greatest fear, what would shake his faith), and what Time Lords have faith in (Rita asked him).

""Himself"" could be the answer to both, but I'm not sure. He certainly hates himself more than he hates anything or anyone else, but is that the same thing as fear? Fear of his own fallibility, his potential evil or insanity is a big one, but fear of the loss of his companions and the TARDIS could be worse. 

He needs very much to be loved, his desire to not be seen as a warrior or as evil is what acts as his checkpoint to gauge his own behavior. What if everyone, even the TARDIS, gave up on him? If they all concluded that he has *already* gone too far, a lost cause not worthy of their affection or respect? He'd end up utterly alone, and probably go mad. The Doctor alone could destroy the universe. But he'd have a moment, however brief, where he'd be going mad but still be sane enough to know it was happening. And while at the moment he can control himself (more or less), he can't control his friends. Having them all turn on him would be something outside his control, and it would lead to him becoming everything he hates most. That could be a fear worse than anything.

For who the Doctor has faith in, in the 7th Doctor story [***Curse of the Fenrics,***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_Fenric#Continuity) the Haemovores are repelled by faith, and the Doctor drives them off by chanting the names of his former companions.

In NI, 'normal' opening hours for Public Houses run from 11:30am to 11pm on weekdays and Saturdays (other than Good Friday or Christmas Day), and 12:30pm to 10pm on Sundays (again other than Christmas Day).

'Places of public entertainment' - including clubs - can apply for 'Additional permitted hours', provided the alcohol served is not the 'main' function of the premises business - ie: the entertainment supplied must be the main reason the business is open, and such entertainment must not cease before the bar finishes serving. In reality, all this means is that music must be played.

These additional hours extend the licence until 1am the following morning on weekdays and Saturdays (again, with the exceptions of Good Friday and Christmas day), and midnight on Sundays (Christmas, yadda yadda yadda).

In practice, however, these regulations are enforced rather infrequently. It generally takes a specific complaint to instigate an investigation - the police will not go looking for infractions without one. Thanks, Spotlight.

**TL;DR:** Pubs can generally serve until 11pm, clubs until 1am the following day. On Sundays, they must stop an hour earlier.

Newcastle is awesome.  Bear in mind though that to the Geordies Sunderland is a long way away (it's about 30 miles).  Distances in the UK may seem short to you but others will think they are long.  So when you say ""fancy going to x"" where x is 50 miles away people will probably think you're crazy.

Visit the Northumberland countryside.  Go to Wylam and drink british beer.  NOT the shitty lager like carling, but proper ale.  Wylam are a fantastic brewery in the town of Wylam just outside Newcastle for instance.

Go to the Free Trade pub.  It look srough but it isn't, it is awesome. Also go to the Cluny.

There are lots of good bands to see in town.  Try local bands at the Cluny and at the Head of Steam.

Join a society or two at the uni and do whatever you can think of, such as climbing (there are a few good climbing walls in the region).

Visit the beach in the cold at Whitley bay and go camping in the little places up the East Coast.

Come and visit Scotland too.  Edinburgh isn't far on the train and it's practically built for tourists.

Go to the Hyena comedy club (if it's still running!) I remember many a good comedy gig with unknown comedians there.

Get a ferry to Amsterdam and enjoy the Netherlands.  Ferris run from Newcastle.

The rest of the country is nothing like London so don't expect it to be so.  London is bigger and more densely packed than anywhere else.

You could also try the coast to coast bike ride that runs from Newcastle across to the West coast.

Hadrian's Wall isn't far away (the northern wall built by the Romans marking the North of their empire).

Go and watch some rugby.  The Newcastle Falcons play out at Kingston park.  Maybe see a football match too, Newcastle United is practically a religion in Newcastle.  Don't go to a Sunderland Newcastle game though unless you like fighting and feeling frightened.

It's irrational if they plan on a) using any electricity, or b) not doing something about it, eg. investing/researching/working in renewable energy.

If they want to live without it then it's fine. If they want to get of their asses and take on the challenge that's fine. If they want to sit around and whine without providing a realistic solution then they're idiots.

It's far too easy to protest and complain, but these are complex problem in the real world with finance, politics, resources, and everything else to contend with.

I live quite near a Nuclear power station, i have no issue with it, i am much much more likely to die in my car on the way to work than i am as a result of a malfunction in the station. 

Don't get me wrong, accidents are going to happen, no matter how safe you try and make a system chances are it isn't going to work 100% of the time. However, give me the slight increase in risk (of either direct damage to myself or environmental damage on a large scale) to the certainty that fossil fuels will continue to damage the environment in a massive way, and i know which i would choose.

Thanks. You just picked a good topic to argue with me about - consumer contracts interest me, and I've researched them before.

&gt; the paper contract (which contains none of that info

*That* is more interesting. If the contract you actually signed really didn't contain any of that, or wasn't the whole contract but didn't give reasonable notice that it wasn't the whole contract; or if the difference is cos they've changed it and Virgin didn't give you reasonable notice that they were changing the terms and a chance to not accept the changes and cancel -- then you've got a good argument that those terms aren't part of the contract you have with Virgin.

I'd be kinda surprised if that was the case, though - companies are usually really careful about that sort of thing.

&gt; What if it was secured, but a rogue passerby obtained the password by conducting a brute-force attack? ... That's hardly ""permitting a third party to do so""

True. You'd probs have a good argument if that happened.

&gt; I think can I recall certain controversial acts, or portions of them, being challenged in the courts. Apologies for how vague that sounded.

Most of those are probably challenges under the Human Rights Act. Thing is, if an Act is found to be incompatible, then all the judges can do is issue a Declaration of Incompatibility. That doesn't make the Act stop working. It doesn't really do much at all, except in theory embarrass the government. Which is why e.g. the Belmarsh detainees were [still kept in prison](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4100481.stm) after the terrorism legislation they were detained without trial under was found to breach their human rights. Which kinda sucks.

&gt; this isn't about civil liability (very limited as it is) to comply with the ToS, in the original context it's about criminal liability for copyright infringement 

IIRC, the act doesn't actually create any new criminal offences for copyright infringement. It just gives the SoS the power to order an ISP to shut off your internet. (Though I could be wrong, haven't read it in full).

And yeah, you're right that the DEA doesn't create an explicit obligation to not let people breach copyright through your connection. But since the only requirement for them to shut it off is that 'the report relates to the subscriber's IP address at the time of [the copyright infringement]', if you don't want that to happen you'd better not let people do that, so the 'obligation' is just an implicit one if you don't want your connection shut off.

(Also, I don't think anyone actually knows what the letter actually says, since I'm pretty sure they haven't started sending any out yet).",0,1331149081,null,0,false,0,c3ynlri,t3_qk0n4,t1_c3ynlri,t1_c3yfoaa,null,1428484274,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As for the ""real-world"" problems of politics, finances, resources, and wotnot: again, no one, as far as I know, is denying that they are complex things that have to be dealt with. But too often they are approached with only the short-term in mind. Nuclear power is a case in point: it is always touted as a cheap energy source, but advocates seem to completely forget that the enormous cost of decommissioning old plants isn't fully factored into the equation. Moreover, if there ever is, heaven forbid, a disaster here on the scale of a Chernobyl or Fukushima, then what will the ultimate cost of that be? 

And it's all well and good saying a Fukushima isn't likely to happen here, but while there is still *some* possibility, however small, it is certainly ***not*** irrational to fear it. When Fukushima was first reported to the world, there were countless people on Reddit saying, ""Don't worry, it can't go into meltdown!"" and anyone who dared to suggest it could was labelled hysterical and downvoted into oblivion. 

Having said all of that, I do agree that nuclear power is probably the only viable solution to meet our future energy requirements, for the time being at least. I don't like it, I would hate to live in close proximity to a nuclear plant, but it seems to the least bad option that is currently available to us. Unfortunately, however, our government *still* doesn't seem to have a long-term strategy for meeting our future energy needs.

Regarding nuclear power, it's not irrational to fear it, but your fear of it is still irrational. That is, if you had rational fear about nuclear power to the point where you didn't want to live anywhere near a plant, than you would also never get in a car, never fly in a plane, never live within a few hundred miles of a coal power plant, never ride a bike, never eat a banana... do I need to go on?

Yes there are some absolutely terrible but almost insignificant dangers from nuclear power that are eclipsed by a thousand other things you are quite happy to do and are *literally* hundreds of thousands of times more likely to kill you. It's not irrational to fear any of them, but to fear one that is so insignificant over all of the others which are far more dangerous for you is the *very definition* of irrational!

&gt; Major-General Julian Thompson, who led the Falklands invasion in 1982, declaring that it couldn’t be done again because budget cuts had deprived the Navy of an aircraft carrier. 
“The Argentines have a marine brigade. They’ve got a parachute brigade and some good special forces,” he told the Times. “All they’ve got to do is get those guys onto the islands for long enough to destroy the [British] Typhoon jets and that’s the end of it.” 

The article goes on to say:

&gt;He neglected to mention that the 1982 invasion was conducted by a British military that had been so devastated by decades of austerity that it had to use tourist cruise ships as troop carriers, or that Mr. Cameron’s cuts will only pare the military down to early-2000s budget levels, still many times higher than 1980s strength. But a good general always seizes the high ground.

The problem is that PhD funding has been cut which traditionally provided a lot of employment for maths/science students meanwhile the weak economy has hit engineers badly (alongside outsourcing).

Also STEM students are less likely to accept poor jobs as someone who has done Media Studies for three years might go and work in retail, someone who has studied advanced mathematics and spent their university years working very, very hard would be much less likely to do so until absolutely forced to.

There is also the fact that a nuclear disaster appears much more dramatic than the damage done by traditional energy sources, the number of people killed by coal is just a statistic to most people, but a *nuclear meltdown* has a larger impact on the psyche.

When assessing risk, statistical likelihoods are the primary concern, it is simply a fact that nuclear power is much less harmful to people than other types of power generation, however much people fear it, that is just the truth. 

With the way the media reacts to every nuclear ""incident"" you'd think the world was in danger of collapsing. I think that the media has to take a significant portion of the blame when it comes to peoples fear of nuclear power. 

I also think your use of the term ""instantly disastrous"" is out of hand, even if you include incidents like three mile island the number of deaths from nuclear accidents is incredibly low compared to any other power source. 

""Stuart Arm states, ""apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident.""[7]""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents

I know as i said before that Wikipedia is not the best source but based on the reading i have done recently i think i can rely on it in this instance. (im happy to look for a few more sources if you like). 

And even if they had the number of deaths would not even touch what coal and oil have done, and have the potential to keep on doing.

When faced with this the fear of using nuclear power does seem irrational to me. Again i am going to reiterate, and i think you may have alluded to this in your previous posts, people fear nuclear power because of the potential consequences, however unlikely, but that does  not change the fact that it is the best option available to us at this time.

I see that **IAmJesusAMA** (a fellow [/r/coys](/r/coys) Yid) started a match thread in [/r/soccer](/r/soccer).

While I can't say that one is better than the other, I still see the obvious difference; that his has **continuous updates** of what's happening in the game.

This is something my match threads lack, and isn't likely to incorporate as I'm watching the games from my telly with no access or want of access to my PC.

If you are in fact streaming the game I don't think there's much point in checking in for updates, but if you just drop in to see what's happening it can definitely serve a purpose.

##Do we feel that I (or whomever) should keep doing a match thread in here or should we use the ones over at [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) (especially if they're made by a fellow Yid)?

The only problem I can think of with *not* having one here, is that here we're *mostly* Spurs fans only (save the regular Woolwich trolls), and [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) is, as mentioned almost once a day, a Woolwich circle-jerk.

&gt;Remploy originally wanted to close 43 factories to focus on placing disabled people into mainstream employment. However, Hain stepped in at the Labour Party Conference to promise that no closures would be made without his go-ahead.

&gt;The approved plan, which will keep 15 extra factories open, relies on Remploy raising an extra £163m in sales to the government in the next five years, and cutting costs by £10m by changing working practices.

&gt;Hain said: ""We will need to lever in a massive 130% increase in public procurement to achieve this. It was the best I could do.

&gt;""In addition, Remploy will quadruple the number of disabled people it gets into mainstream employment.""

&gt;The GMB union, which led the fight for all factories to remain open, expressed its dismay at Hain's decision to close 28 of them. General secretary Paul Kenny said: ""This government-controlled operation has failed its people, its principles and its purpose."" He said the union would continue to campaign for changes to the Remploy management team.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/nov/12/economy.uk

&gt;The row over the planned closure of factories for disabled workers that overshadowed the Labour party conference resurfaced today when Remploy was accused of ""jumping the gun"" by making public its revised plans for shutting down sites.

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7012002.stm

&gt;the government had seemed likely to face its only defeat on the conference floor at Gordon Brown's first party conference as leader and prime minister.

&gt;The GMB union had planned to put forward a motion calling on ministers to stop plans to close the Remploy factories with the loss of 2,500 jobs.

A species that has unlocked the mystery of time, to know every secret of their own future if they wished, and to live nearly forever demands that they believe life be worth living, and that by extension they believe it is beautiful. His worst fear is the anti-thesis of that, himself twisted to be a warrior of death and destruction. The time lords weren't stupid when they made the no-interference rule-if they dictated and intervened for the good of all species they would inevitably become tyrants. The only reason the doctor isn't a tyrant himself is that he comes down to the level of the species he helps and works with them, not above them. (Although lately, other species have begun to see him as lording over them.) His fear is that he will become something not worth living, which shakes his faith that all life is always worth living in the end.

TL;DR He has faith in life itself, namely that it is worth living despite the pain.

You have to show some physical evidence in terms of verbal or written examples of harassment that you have received. Sitting outside someone's house watching them is not considered harassment.

Working more efficiently. Reducing wage costs by automation.

Here's an example from my current experience. 

Every month I have to have a blood test. When I enter the unit I hand a booklet over to one of the medical staff, who takes it to a computer and notes down *all* the results from *last month* - about 8 or 9 different figures - into it. She does this for everyone else's, too.

Then she hands the booklet back to me. I now have the figures from 4 weeks ago. I do nothing with it. I'm not sure why I should be interested in my erythrocyte sedimentation rate from a month ago.

I take the booklet home and then I put it away  until next month.


Now. *there is not point to any of this*. I'd guess it's a hangover from before their records were computerised. It could be done away with. Then the trained nurse who sits filling in these figures all morning could be doing, you know *nursing*.

Are you sure? I thought this amendment was dropped, and it was only for them not to pay for the first year in any case.

&gt;3, without these fees the UK Gov was paying for EU students to go to UK uni's. That's unsustainable for the numbers that attend (I went to Sussex, which had a massive number of EU students). So the quality of British education is important.

And other EU countries do the same, I don't see why you think this is so unsustainable. In fact, I've been paid a total of almost 4000 Euros to work in Germany for two summers by the DAAD, precisely because they want people to work in their industry there. No wonder they're doing better off than we are.

They shouldn't. Really the government should nationalise the universities to stop profiteering like this.

Yeah I did do a lot of programming as well I should have mentioned that but to me it kind of went without saying. Requirements gathering, data structures, design patterns, GUI design and a database module were also required so there was a bit more to it than learning programming languages. After all university can't teach you all programming languages and it's the core concepts that are more important than the syntax of a particular language. The language I write in now I didn't learn at uni.

&gt;It shouldn't have been. A good CS degree will be far more general and you'll learn maths, lots of maths, and some more maths, operating systems, computer architecture, data structures, algorithms, networking, assembly, possibly some hardware design (we created a 4bit ALU), and even exotic subjects like computational biology (which I studied and enjoyed - you don't need a computer to compute). However, I went to a research intensive university, and they're the best places to do CS as they lead their fields.

At my uni you could be very flexible at which modules you choose to do, so a CS grad could have done those modules (except computational biology, I've never heard if that before) but they could also to do exactly the same modules as a software engineering student if they wanted.

true,phillyharper,null,null,"He casually forgets to include real economics anywhere in his 'debunking' of non-growth economics. Our economy does not rest on the foundations of high value, long lasting goods. GDP is increased by selling MORE, rather than selling BETTER. Look at phones, look at Primark, look at technology, look at cars, look at petrol. The only industry that's had a marked change has been energy, and the reason is quite simple, resources have forced the industry's hand and we're now in a situation where e.On are GIVING their customers efficient lightbulbs.

GDP is a measure of the value of goods and services. Correct. However, to increase GDP, the total output of goods sold is the route to increased value in goods and services sold.

Where are these industries in which customers are saving their money more and more to buy higher and higher quality goods because their percieved value continues to grow? I can't think of a single good example. Even the house market demonstrated that the value of something can not continually rise without creating a bubble.

The reality is, the cost (and therefore the value) of goods continues to fall as quantity of goods sold increases. An original Xbox was £450 in 2004, you can now buy one on eBay for £12. A current Xbox is probably £150. Just one example of how the value of goods consistently *decreases* rather than increases, which means the total sales of goods *increases* to ensure growth.

Hence, we *will* hit an environmental limit relatively quickly with the way that the economy is currently growing.

Divn't ye Kna, means ""didn't you know""
gann means going
woman are often called ""flower"" as a term of endearment (even if they don't know you at all)
Howay has no real meaning, or 1000 meanings, it's just a word they use, like ""Howay man, divn't ye kna that lass's proper canny like"" translated as ""Hey man, did you not know that girl is a nice person""
cunt is an acceptable word to use as about 10% of your vocabulary 
Despite this they are genuinely lovely people, don't be offended!

More common slang in the UK:

""sound"" meaning good, often used in the phrase ""sound as a pound"", meaning good and safe.

""Cheers"" meaning thank you. Also ""ta"" meaning thank you.

In general say thank you and excuse me about 300% more than it is said in the US.

Not only that, but they have butchered every single enemy. Daleks have become power rangers, Cybermen appeared in *A Good Man Goes to War* for absolutely no reason, and Moffat forever destroyed the fond memory of *Blink* by making that terrible story arc about the Weeping Angels.

true,ShoujoShinobi,smith,Smith,"&gt;Then came one of the best companions to day, who got almost no time to shine before realizing she was too good for the doctor

There is no love here for her but IMO, as an individual and in connection with The Doctor, she's one of the most well-crafted companions (writers totally wasted her potential) for many reasons:

Let's just get it out of the way.  Very pretty actress with a stellar body. I'd slap my momma if it meant I woke up with her figure!

She's a doctor(ish) that could have been actually useful on their adventures since the entire universe is mostly human anyway.  

She's the only one introduced as confident and happily pursuing her own agenda, instead of just going through the motions, hoping for some one or thing to make it better . Martha's ambitious and self-assured and joins The Doctor not because she's running away from herself, but strictly for the adventure of it.  That's my kind of awesome.  

Most importantly, she walked away from that adventure, not because the Doctor wasn't interested in her, she barely even mentions it. He (9&amp;10) mooned over Rose and later Donna becomes his bestest friend ever, yet he treats Martha in a callous manner, even after he knows about her feelings for him and makes no attempts to apologize or correct his behavior.  She gave up all the wonders of the universe to protect herself from a man who would never give her what she needed and I fucking love that about her! ^ETR:grammatical ^fuckery",0,1331212620,null,0,true,0,c3ywgsw,t3_qmpjk,t1_c3ywgsw,t1_c3yuagw,null,1428488519,16,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,16

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"&gt;FUTURE legislation privatising then NHS; not THIS legislation, which does no such thing...It certainly won't force people to pay for treatment

It does take definite steps towards privatisation though, and it [already has](http://member.ubmmedica.co.uk/postdirect.php?url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/newsarticle-content/-/article_display_list/12825105/gp-practice-under-fire-for-offering-nhs-patients-private-treatment&amp;params=YTozOntzOjg6InNzb0NoZWNrIjtzOjQ6InRydWUiO3M6NzoiZ3JvdXBJZCI7czo3OiI0NTg1MTU5IjtzOjY6InZlcmlmeSI7aTowO30=) caused people to have to start paying for some treatment in one part of the country.

It provides for increases in state-funded provision of healthcare via private providers, and it doesn't take much of a leap to see where that's going; if the money the NHS receives is passed on to private providers, the NHS doesn't get it and can't itself provide treatment. If private providers are able to undercut the NHS through whatever means (absorbing costs/lower standards/etc), it permanently undermines the ability of the NHS to provide treatment in the future. And, of course, private providers can withdraw from contracts with the NHS in the future, leaving the NHS unable to provide care.

Without wishing to start frothing about the Tories feathering the nests of their private sector mates, that's...basically what's happening; care will increasingly be farmed out to private sector companies, who are (quite correctly) motivated by profit, and not the NHS. The danger of that to me is that the private sector healthcare providers will eventually start to pick and choose whom they treat (based on cost), rather than abide by the principle of the NHS to provide care for all. And that principle itself - that the Secretary of State for Health has a specific responsibility to provide a healthcare system that's free at point of delivery - [is removed by this bill](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/29/nhs-bill-lansley-wash-hands). That alone ought to demonstrate which direction this bill is trying to take the NHS.

Furthermore, the bill will turn more public sector hospitals into public/private hybrids (a trend started under the Labour government, in fairness), and again, it's possible those hospitals will, in the future, start choosing whom they treat on the basis that they need to perform for shareholders.

Another reason to think the intention of the bill is to put the NHS on the road to privatisation because that's how the Tories ideologically believe to be the best way of providing healthcare, which is obviously fine if that's what you believe is the best way of fixing the undoubted problems in the NHS, but I feel it'll put us well on the way to an American style system and that's much worse than what we have now.

Having said all that, you're a Scot in London - I'm the reverse; I'm English and I live in Edinburgh - and these proposals don't affect the NHS here, so I guess I'm blathering about things that don't really concern me.

Just to go back to my question though - does it not concern you that the NHS itself thinks this is a bad plan, and so do many of the professional bodies?",0,1331212865,null,0,false,0,c3ywhku,t3_qn4z4,t1_c3ywhku,t1_c3yw9kw,null,1428488527,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It is extremely rare for any program to have a 'clean' first series in regard to no hiccups, no writers trying to find the show's core voice, no actors wriggling around to settle into that perfect fit for their characters. It is pretty damn normal for a show's first series to look a bit silly when set against later years, and that seems only moreso when your program isn't strictly a drama, nor quite a comedy, nor wholly traditional tech-driven science-fiction.

So sure, Living Plastic and farting aliens is a bit lulzy when we look at Weeping Angels and the like. Quite a few Whovians seem to be able to react with a very lovely 'So? And?' It's the new bones of Who. Other than Eccleston taking off before some fans were ready, I wouldn't change a thing.

It reminds me of Star Trek: The Next Generation. I don't know if it ever took off in the UK (although I'd love to know, so if anyone has any idea, please chime in) but in the US it was probably the most well known and respected sci-fi show alongside Quantum Leap. But if you look back on the first season, it's all over the place. There are glaring continuity errors they decided to ignore later on (for anyone familiar with the show, Data's brain being part organic in ""The Naked Now"" and then later on completely positronic) vast shifts in the personalities of the characters, characters that just ended up disappearing after a season or completely changing ranks, etc. And there was *less* time between the last movie and the beginning of the series.

You're right. It's very typical of every genre, but it seems more obvious in sci-fi because we're the type of person to notice those changes, rectcons and omissions.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"The ""natural order"" is that you die of a horrible disease before you reach maturity. The natural order is that a harsh winter will kill all but the most lucky in a population. An argument of morals *from nature* probably has a Latin term for it but I don't know of one. Safe to say, it isn't a very good argument or justification for anything; let alone selfishness and greed.

""The problem with this country..."" is a phrase that I hear so often; only an arrogant, ignorant person thinks that they are smarter than ""the pile"" and have all the solutions to the problems put before us. 

We have become a nation that settles for corruption and selfishness as an answer to a lack of universal philosophy. This empire is dead and when it was alive it was not founded on empathy, sacrifice, belief or any other noble piece of propaganda spread to justify the actions of sick individuals making sure they were, as you put it, firmly at the top of the pile.

Always striving to be the top of the pile of humanity by stepping on other people is why we have corrupt politicians and ignorant bigots. Its why some go hungry while others have too much; its why envy and power have more place in people's hearts than kindness and contentment. Social conscience is replaced with the ""society of me"".

I don't care what political philosophy people think is exactly correct because none of them are. I think they all have things in common; they are based on models that are all just have degrees of wrongness when trying to explain the world. That's fine though; they aid our understanding and help us make decisions based on available evidence, there is no immortal design pattern for utopia but we can still try and create a world that is better for us all rather than *relying* on our lust and basic need for survival to correct the actions of those that we disagree with.

The only real philosophy that will make life easier and a less trying experience is quite a simple one. From Jesus to Gandhi great but flawed historical figures have basically tried to say one thing: ""Don't be a dick"". We all die, we all struggle; but some of us strive make others worse when they already have enough.

In this specific story, I'd want to know who these journalists are and why things are so bad they attempt suicide - as stated, tabloids are not known for such sympathetic consideration usually - they certainly have no scruples about doorstopping grieving widows/ hacking murdered children's phones and the like and then pretending that the story being *yesterday* means it vanished from everyone's minds (Murdoch is even doing this at the moment, doing his best to present their actions as yesterdays pizza). Not that the hacking could be put to the E. Standard, at least so far - their journo's are too busy using their Jewish heritage as some sort of invisible shield when accused of Nazi-like behaviour by people they door-stop, as if the former means the latter magically vanishes.

UK banger, US sausage. ""Sausage"" is not exclusively American, it is used in both countries. Banger is a colloquial term for sausage, from when sausages used to burst when you cooked them. Modern sausage skins don't do this. I haven't heard anyone call it a banger for years.

UK bilberry, US blueberry. We say blueberry in the UK more often than bilberry.

UK broad bean, US fava or lima bean. Yes, fava bean=broad bean. But a lima bean is a butterbean.

UK chicory, US endive. These are two different plants that are often confused.

UK chipolata, US cocktail sausage. Two different things. A [chipolata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipolata) is about the same length as a normal sausage, but thinner. A cocktail sausage is about an inch long and served at buffets. The linked wikipedia page warns not to confuse the two.

His performances in the Big Finish audio dramas *really* make me wish he would have been asked back for Series 1 instead of them casting Eccleston.

He didn't get to do the ""dark"" Doctor thing in the movie, but when he did in the audios, it's fucking awesome.

He also did the sense of awe and wonder at the universe itself better than Eccleston and Tennant (though Matt's been doing a good job with that).

'Our' economy cannot function like it did, because it would lead to the same outcomes of wealth inequality and corruption. The economy is based on intangible wealth trumping the tangible, wealth extraction/destruction over creation (I would liken it to slaying the golden goose), 'jobs' for job's sake, a money of scarcity, and an impossible ever ending demand for growth. People don't want jobs, they want meaning and purpose.

It's not pretty, but if government wants to convince employers to take on younger workers, there are very few alternatives.
