true,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"That's definitely the perception around him and its probably more or less correct but really that's the thing that separates him from most other players. What people don't see is his tenacity and hunger, he's a very direct player who can really give the opposition a bad time late in games and he's a somewhat sensible player, he doesn't mindlessly blast the ball and, probably a by-product of being at Arsenal, likes to pass and move.
Furthermore he's managed 3 goals and 4 assists in 10 league matches this season, and that comes from only 3 starts, that's fairly decent considering he's played a paltry 422 minutes of play, that's a goal every 140 minutes. Looking at all comps it becomes 9 goals, 6 assists - although considerably more game time.

He has his detractors and I definitely not one of them and would love to see him here. He's a player who doesn't really offer much more than pace and direct running, but it's an approach that is somewhat effective. In fact looking at his league numbers alone no other Arsenal player has contributed as many goals+assists than him, this despite playing less than half the amount of time as players such as Cazorla (1070 mins), Podolski (878 mins), Giroud (803 mins) and Arteta (1080 mins).

My point here is that behind all the hype he does actually bring a lot to the pitch, and he's just 23 ffs - he' younger that most of our first team and comes with 5 years of prem experience (that's 20+ games per season).

This deal really comes down to the *financial package*, and there probably will be other options that may be better out there, but **I doubt there'll be another opportunity like this to get Walcott**.

You've also got more time to adapt in a worse team as well. When you're pushing for 4th (as we'd like to be) you can't carry a player until they find form/click with the rest of the team.

This relates to the style of play thing as well. We have been moving towards a more 'technical' style of football through the club for ages (I remember us bringing in a lot of young skillful players and even coaches under the Jol(Santini)/Arnesen reign). Redknapp set that back a bit with his style (not that it wasn't skillful) but the first team was a bit isolated from the youth.

If AVB wants to bring his style of play to the team, it's a lot harder to do that while maintaining the previous results. Compare to say Rodgers at Liverpool, he'll be given a lot less slack. Liverpool can afford to stay still (or go backwards) knowing that Rodgers style of play takes time to adapt, because they aren't challenging for anything now.

I'd also say Modric, Bale, GDS, KPB, Kaboul, going though to Walker and Naughton were all young/risky buys, some of which didn't pay off. Going back to my first point sometimes it's easier for a young player to find their feet in a worse team with less pressure Kaboul and KPB weren't great with us (Kaboul the first time) but after playing at Pompey for a bit they are now both in top class teams.

There are millions of examples of players who for many reasons just don't hit it off at their new club and then go back out to become superstars.

Look at all the top players that have been redeveloped from the conveyor belt of poor performances coming out of Real Madrid: they are all all-stars again now, such as Sneijder, Van De Vaart, Granero, Sahin, Robben, Gago, Canales, Las, Garay, Guti, Raul, Diarra etc. etc.

It doesn't mean Torres is a crap player, it just means that he didn't fit in at Chelsea. That wouldn't be a first for Chelsea either, there is a deep pit full of superstar players and prospects who have gone there to find they have no place in the team. This wouldn't be the first time for that either.

Taking transfer flops from big clubs is how a lot of medium sized clubs can reinvent themselves and improve their teams at a fraction of the price. It is straight out of soccernomics.

&gt;  Ms Grant meanwhile has defended her claim for maximum expenses to cover accommodation, despite living just 19 miles from the Commons in Reigate, Surrey, and not her Maidstone constituency.
The equalities minister rents a Thameside flat near the MI6 building in Vauxhall funded by the taxpayer, receiving expenses claims of £1,666.67 per month. The maximum allowed within the rules for rental payments is £20,000 per year.

Less than £420 a week to rent a flat in central London is a bargain. But lets take the fact her constituency is 20 miles away into account. She would be able to claim travel expenses and has to travel by a combination of train and taxi so how much would that cost to do 7 times or so in a week? She also loses 1.5hrs each way in time whilst travelling so how much does that impact on the time she has working as a MP? I charge £30/hr labour costs so losing 3hrs a day costs me £90. All of a sudden that £420 a week rent looks a bit of a bargain....

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","There are two problems outlined by ianvisits:

1. The differential between benefits and minimum wage is low.

2. If you move from benefits (paid fortnightly in advance) to wages (paid monthly in arrears), you have a 4 to 6 week gap between your last benefit payment and your first wage packet.

The first of these problems is hard to solve, but I notice that ianvisits has [already discussed his views](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/13g1m2/concrete_accident_blamed_on_lack_of_translation/c73n08r).

The second is simpler, and is something Iain Duncan-Smith has discussed fixes for in Tory policy; we need some way to transition people from benefits to wages that doesn't involve several weeks living on savings, not least because many people on benefits have no savings. 

One route could be (for example) to transition claimants from being given benefits to being loaned the same money interest-free for a limited period as they shift into work - so for their first 6 weeks of employment, they get loaned the benefit payment interest-free for 6 weeks. For the next 4 weeks, it's loaned for 4 weeks; for the next 2, you lend it for 2 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks' employment, you're expected to be supporting yourself on your wages without the need for loans.

There are other ways to fix this problem - but the baseline is that if a claimant takes a job paying monthly in arrears at just the wrong point in their benefits cycle, they are punished for doing so by being forced to cope for 6 weeks with no income. That is a trap, and we should remove it so that work pays.",0,1353407476,null,0,false,0,c745n9f,t3_13g1m2,t1_c745n9f,t1_c73mw8d,null,1430454570,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Tesco in my town actually forced the town council to abolish car park charges in its biggest central car park as a result.

You're kidding, right? O...Of course you are, there's no way anyone could mistake a physical position for an identifying label... right?

&gt;""Equal, but different"" is not equal at all.

But differences between people still exist, don't we celebrate that diversity in people? Until we all evolve into single transgender single skin colour race, there will always be differences. Not to say that anyone should be discriminated against, but at least have some rationality about what a person can and can't do.

&gt;there will probably always be loopholes that are overlooked.

It'll be the same if gay marriage is legalised. Then again, technical issues and loopholes are no reason that a change in the law should not be considered, if not made.

&gt;These treaties will not apply to civil partnerships.

~~Nor will they apply to gay marriage.~~ Oh right, it's a form of protest or political pressure on an international scale. I get it now. I guess it could work. There's still the factor of nations which will skin a man without trial if they even suspect they are gay, but isn't that just a symptom of even deeper problems within a culture, where many people are discriminated against based on gender, disability and so forth? The problem is greater than the legal status of gay marriage.

**(Warning: Alarmist statement approaching)** Besides, if we allow same sex marriage, the terrorists will consider us even greater infidels and try to bomb us harder. Although sure, the legal status of gay marriage in our country in relation to their desire to kill us all is effectively a drop in the ocean (which, is around the same amount of influence it will have in changing their culture as well).

Ultimately, I don't really care if same sex marriage is legalised. It just strikes me as something gay people want so they can show off. I don't like show offs.

You have a core volume of internal staff to cover what would be a standard workload.  In a worst case scenario there is enough work for all these people to do.  On top of that you outsource anything which is additional work.  It can be like a tap that you turn on and off so that you can keep on top of the work, but anything that would need to be done on a permanent basis would result in an increase to the internal staff.

The NHS is something I see like this.  On some occasions you need to increase capacity so you get private companies to do it.  Things like reducing the waiting list for those people who have been waiting for over 2 years - get the private sector to do it and pay them.  For anything that is just bog standard that will need to be done every day at a similar level then you can hire people internally to do it.

Remy was going to Tottenham and was reported as a done deal, this broke down the day before the deadline. So Chelsea made an enquiry and it was too high for the type of player Remy is.

Plus 4 months ago was a different situation. Chelsea was flying high with Champions league success. Hazard, Oscar, Marin, Moses had all come in and we all believed that without Drogba, Torres would step up with Sturridge cover and if needs we had Hazard/Moses to fill the gap. Lukaku could always be recalled if the situation gets too serious.

No one (execpt you in all your ultimate wisdom) predicted that Torres would be this bad and had lost so much ability. Just wait till January, see what the Chelsea board can do and hope that either Torres pulls his finger out or Chelsea buy a suitable and worth while striker.

Therefore, slim profit margin businesses will increase their prices the most as the additional tax will destroy their bottom line. This includes food, petrol stations and others.

true,Galcius,null,null,"Very simply because tax is a way of taking a cut of wealth that is created, and turnover is not a measure of wealth creation, but a measure of the amount of wealth that goes through a system.

In other words, wealth is created when you create and sell a commodity with a value greater than whatever was used to create it. So for example, if there is a pin factory with 10 employees, it buys in strips of metal and the employees make pins from the strips of metal. The pins made from the metal are worth more than the metal itself, so wealth has been created. The factory therefore sells those pins on, and it's profit is determined by the value of the pins minus the value of the materials and labour. The profit represents the wealth that has been created by making those pins.

An individual also makes their own commodity: their labour. Labour is sort of special but it acts very much like a commodity for all intents and purposes. The person spends time doing work, and this work has a value. Therefore, the individual has created wealth just by going to work, and that wealth is paid back to them (to a greater or lesser extent) by their employer. The individual's income is therefore their profit.

Therefore individuals and companies are taxed in the same way; the company through the profits made on its sales, and the individual through the profits made by their labour.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Because that's ultimately how the rich stay rich. If you think about it a company is a haven from liability, national jurisdiction, identification, and many taxes. Businesses never have to die so inheritance tax isn't an issue. If I need to pay a cleaner for my house, a gardener, or anything else, each transaction is taxed at 20%. When a company with its own cleaner, gardener, or anything else, and trade occurs internally, there is no such taxation. The same goes for a boss and personal assistant. Should a business bankrupt, the owner becoming a board member or whatever, can keep his (ill gotten) gains. The houses he bought and the fleet of cars, totally untouchable. Companies can shift losses forwards or back.

A situation where everyone is perhaps self employed and no one can shift any sort of liability from themselves to fictional constructs like corporations could be an improvement. Money isn't taxed per calendar year, but on each transaction or perhaps a daily/hourly micro taxation on bank accounts.

Having said that, I'd like to pursue the idea of zero taxation, however, I am no neoliberal but prefer anarchistic systems. Neither am I an anarcho-capitalist. I'd remove taxation but along side that I'd remove intellectual property, debt enforcement by the state, and any fictional (legal) abstractions.

true,thorva,null,null,"Disclaimer: my Oxford interview was nearly ten years ago, in the autumn of 2003, but I helped with the admissions open days as a student in 2006 and 2008. Here is this for what it's worth:

1. Oxford law admissions at undergrad level have been centralized since at least '05 or '06 (they made the change while I was there), so if you are good enough, you will get a place at a college. If Brasenose is oversubscribed, they'll send you somewhere else—possibly even for a second interview while you're up there.

2. They gave me an easy case to read and asked me general-analytical questions about it. Prior knowledge of law is not required, it is not helpful, and, I suspect, not especially welcome. What was being examined is whether I could (a) identify the issue in the case, (b) identify the competing arguments supporting each side, and (c) whether I was able to give convincing reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with the result. If I remember correctly, it was fairly straightforward as cases go... something from criminal law (arson, maybe?). 

3. Let me expand on the prior knowledge point a little bit: read about politics and current affairs, especially any of them with legal plots or implications (phone hacking? Julian Assange? that sort of thing), but don't try to know anything about the law beyond the most vague introductory matters like the structure of the UK court system and a little bit about the legal profession. If you like, you can read Adam Tomkins' excellent *Public Law* (OUP 2003) or Vernon Bogdanor's *The New British Constitution* (Hart 2009) — both are pitched at the right level.

I had two interviews, the first was quite general, I talked about an A level topic (for me it was the Russian revolution) and they quizzed me about it, requiring an analytical level slightly above, but not completely out of the realms of, what i'd been doing in my A level work. 

Then we did some word problems, they gave me three words which all mean similar things (cause, fault and responsibility) and asked me to define them, then with a series of hypotheticals and other criticisms, made me accept my definitions were wrong and redefine the words, we repeated this for quite a while until I was happy i'd produced the best definitions I could.

For the second interview we were given a legal judgment to read beforehand, we had 1 hour to prepare. The judgment was about 10 A4 pages long (these circumstances were identical at both colleges). Then I was quizzed about the facts of the case, how and why it was decided, if I thought it was the right decision (why? why not?) etc.

Knowledge of the law is not needed at all at interview, I did Law A level so had a beginner's understanding but it never really came in useful, I was sure to slip it into conversation just so they were aware though.

This story appears to have grown mainly in the US right-wing press who sensationalised the gun rights angle. Whilst ignoring counter-arguments is unsurprising (everyone does it to some extent), what's interesting is their merging of strict liability laws and gun control laws to create a ""*government want to take away your guns and enslave us, it's happening in England*"" scare story which obviously appeals highly to that readership base.

true,Galcius,null,null,"&gt;That, of course, is an empirical question, and one which is very hard to test under the current global economic system which very jealously guards its hegemony and precludes the establishment of alternatives. Small scale experiments are sometimes possible, but then their very scale puts them at an enormous disadvantage, and where they prove successful, they are quickly squashed. Thatcher's rape of the TSB was a good example of this.

Yes, it is am empirical question,and the historical precedent is that all successful civilisations have developed ideas of ownership and individual property rights. As it appears that group selection applies on tribal/national levels, it seems to speak against such systems working beyond small, tribal groups.

&gt;I'm very equivocal on the law, and this from one for whom it was his life at one stage. They always taught that justice was the shadow of the law, but I don't see how capitalist law delivers justice (I've seen too much of the opposite), and it's certainly not fair nor impartial.

You're using ""capitalist"" as a synonym for ""how things work right now"", when I'm talking about the necessity of effective law to deliver the best use of capitalist economics.

&gt; ""Mob justice"" is obviously a pejorative way of stating justice for the majority, and I fail to see how justice for the majority is any less just than justice for the small capitalist clique, as we currently have.

No, I'm not. I'm using Mob Justice to describe what happens when a group of people, without impartial judges, decide to take matters into their own hands to right a perceived wrong. It only takes a moment's reflection to realise how badly wrong that can go as soon as people are even vaguely emotional. For example, imagine how quickly any perceived ""paedo"" would be strung up and murdered by mobs if there was no rule of law. Mobs do not act rationally, they act on instinct and emotion. Therefore impartial law is required to prevent lynch mobs.

&gt;The difference with anarchism is that it is so constructed as to ensure that radical and direct democracy serves the interests of all, and that the minority interests which are defended most fiercely are those most alienated from the levers of power.

This is where my earlier statement about faith in humanity applies. I don't have any faith in the ability ""the majority"" act as a buffer to fiercely defended minority interests since people are easily mislead by Rhetoric and emotional appeals. Even the most cursory examination of modern politics proves this point over and over again. For majority consensus to work you'd need fully rational, fully informed individuals, which is an extremely tall order for human beings.

Additionally, it seems to me that the majority would rarely be interested in getting involved in decision making: For example I don't care about issues effecting farmers as I am not a farmer, therefore in any hypothetical anarchist system, I would not get involved in decision making concerning them. Therefore in such a situation it is *only* minority interests who would be involved in the decision making, and we come full circle back to the point where decisions are taken by minority groups for *their* interests rather than the interests of the whole. 

&gt; But anarchism is, at heart, about diffusing power, decentralising, denying all authority but that which can justify itself before intense scrutiny from below.

Yet it seems to me to be only a sensible division of labour to appoint some people to worry about certain things. I'm too busy employing my labour and enjoying (most) of the fruits of that labour to worry about most decision making processes. I'd rather appoint somebody who I'm reasonably confident in to keep track of that stuff and work in what would (hopefully) be my best interests.

&gt;In a worker-owned company, rather than some hybridised form where the workers have a small interest, the workers own all the ""shares"" in their own company. There is no Board except one which they themselves comprise, and no shareholders but themselves.

Again, this is not against 'the rules' of capitalism, it is entirely plausible that such a company could function well in our economic system. It would be fairly unorthodox sure, but not impossible. Many small high tech firms work in similar manners. 

&gt;Well, I wasn't sure that it needed argumentation, it's definitional. Socialist definitions of capitalism, from pre-Marxian, through Marx to the modern day, describe it as a system where those who produce the economic surplus are alienated from it. [...]  Nor can capitalism be described as ""the voluntary exchange of goods in a free market"" as revisionists would often have it. Instead, capitalism is a specific economic system where the means of production are privately controlled by a small group of capitalists. Usually, in the case of large capitalist corporations by a small elite Board of Directors numbering a dozen or so, and another dozen major institutional/individual shareholders. The institutional shareholders are cross-owned by similarly small groups of other Boards etc.

Now you're just providing a conflicting definition of capitalism that conforms to your prejudices. I could easily dismiss anarchism out of hand if I defined it in a similarly pejorative way. Of course doing so would be petty and unfair.

When I am talking about Capitalism, I am talking about the *System of Natural Liberty* proposed by Adam Smith, and the foundations which were laid out in the 17th and 18th century for a system of economics and government which our current capital*ist* system is based heavily on. What you are talking about is not built into that system at any foundational level - you are doing the equivalent of defining Communism by Stalin's Russia.

Don't criticise the foundations of the house based on the weather-vein. 

&gt;I'm certainly not opposed to a more ethical capitalism, in the sense I'm pragmatic enough to take any improvements in the lives of the worst off I can get (I'd push for more, but it'd be an improvement on today). And yes, companies like Mondragon would have a much better shot in a world which was less ruthlessly capitalist, or where people were more informed and picky about who they did business with, where they purchased things, etc.

But if ethical capitalism cannot succeed due to the selfishness of the people, how could anarchism? Capitalism is after all the system designed to redirect selfishness to better ends. Anarchism seems to rely heavily on the good of people and their ability to work together to achieve desirable outcomes.

No of course not, but it is acceptable to ban ""hobbies"" (really? You count it as a hobby?) which cause harm to yourself and other people with no outweighing constructive benefit or supportive reason other than the hedonistic one.

I then remember him leaving and not playing much better for club or country. I think he can't discredit what he did for us, but it's not 2007, he isn't going to be the player he was from 2007-2009. 

You can see it when Chelsea plays, that really the only reason he is out there is because of the high price they paid to get him. He clearly should not be starting for them right now.

Sure, money held by the company will increase the value of the shares, but again you're going to be taxed as soon as you realize a gain by selling them.

There are  number of big problems with taxing on turnover. Firstly, once the money is in the company there is absolutely no encouragement to reinvest it, whereas under the current system money that is reinvested into the business does not attract tax but profits that are either dividended out or left idle are.  

It disproportionately punishes new businesses which often run at a loss for the first few years.  If they were taxed on turnover then they'd be paying taxes on their turnover while still trying to recover the expenses of setting up which is unsustainable.

Is that really true?

UK income tax and national insurance receipts are around £250m on £800m of salaries. Corporation tax and VAT together are £140m on £1.5bn of turnover. Any new 'combined people and corporations' tax would have to generate £390m of revenue on £2.3bn, averaging about 17%.

What would this mean in practice? Well, much of the tax burdon would be shifted from people to companies, leading to significant price rises and wage cuts. The change from value-added tax to revenue tax would penalise fragmented supply-chains, and give vertically integrated corporations a massive advantage. The price of UK exports would rise, leading to a devaluation of the pound, and creating a further reduction in purchasing power. Finally, MNCs with the ability to offshore functions in lower tax countries would do so, giving them yet another advantage over small British firms and creating more downward pressure on UK salaries.

The problem now is that the law can be wielded by any idiot in a police uniform and even if it doesn't lead to a conviction, getting arrested and hauled before a judge is still a pretty unpleasant scenario for anyone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think you understand anarchy either. It was the state that invented slavery to a large extent, and on multiple occasions anarchy drove it out. The post Roman empire Dark Ages would be such a time, slavery became untenable for Europeans. You invoke history, but the greatest crimes have come from the state.

Slavery and taxation are related closer than you think. Taxation raised armies, armies conquered people, either through expropriation or through the imposition of central currency (which allowed for colonisation—peoples were forced to labour and have wealth extracted by the new authority). The state was conceived to expand, subjugate and take ownership of people.

And so for many reasons, the idea of taxation does not sit easily with me because just like back then it is still a means of taking away autonomy in a subtler form of slavery, whilst being inextricably linked with violence—pay your taxes or go to jail (that applies to the little people at least). Taxation also is inextricably woven into the design of currency—why does tokenised obfuscated debt units dominate over mutual credit arrangements? Why doesn't the monetary system currently in use seem robust to corruption? Why can there only be one? The state is a monopoly, and I thought we were supposed to deny and fear monopolies? Fundamentally the state is a projection of a currency domain, and controlling the currency pretty much puts you as the middle man of all human interactions within that sphere. To protect that sphere of influence one always needs an army to deter foreign threats, but also to set upon the internal citizens when they show dissent. Other times you need to invade, say, Iraq, Libya or Iran should there be danger of a break away currency that you don't control. Violence, taxes and debt seem to be the general problem both from a macro level and micro.

To fix the absurdity that is modern finance, one might have to re-imagine  money in such away to make taxation an impossibility or an inescapable internal inevitability. Perhaps neither, but I do believe that egalitarian society or libertarian socialism, cannot exist without an economic revolution, which would require a fair medium of exchange.

I was very fortunate to have private health insurance- and on both occasions the surgeons said that the surgeries could not have gone better. 

I am nowhere near as fit or as strong as i was before the injuries. It is a total lottery as some players are naturally better able to recover than others. Cruciate injuries in particular, are basically a 50/50 as to whether you will regain you previous fitness and strength.

As for Rossi, he's a very good player, but whether or not i would take a gamble on him very much depends on the price. No more than £5m. Still young enough to be useful for a few seasons if he did regain fitness and form, but its a big gamble.

Also if the person or persons who have had their fragile egos rustled, are drama-queens/PC-brigades/SRS trolls, then is faking offense taken, reasonable to be termed a crime in return? If not you empower one category of troll over the other.

Theres a difference between the vulnerable and the canny sociopath using drama-queens as their personal armies to ruin lives for kicks.

We should consider this when defending such wide-reaching definitions of offense or hurt caused to feelings. Might be better if the internet came with a warning about the more candid, less inhibited nature of the internet.

* [""Harassment alarm, or distress""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment,_alarm_or_distress) - Section 4a and 5 Public Order Act 1986

As for Section 127: 

* [Crown Prosecution Service - direct link to the actual piece of relevant lagislation](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#an11)

:- the act pre-dates Twitter, Facebook, G+ etc. The application of a law, not foreseeing the context of off the cuff expression, inherent in these platforms, is doomed to define their abuse in an often inaccurate way.

While Kier Starmer QC has pondered how 'to try to make the law work' before repealing it and making something better (my interpretation of his words):

* [Tweet what you like... as long as you don't have many followers: New guidelines could mean only popular Twitter users are prosecuted for offensive comments](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2232759/New-guidelines-mean-popular-Twitter-users-prosecuted-offensive-comments.html)

* [For God's sake – the DPP *still* doesn't understand how the internet works. Meanwhile, he's planning to censor it](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100008264/for-gods-sake-the-dpp-still-doesnt-understand-how-the-internet-works-meanwhile-hes-planning-to-censor-it/)

It seems all hes got, is to make it necessary for PC-Nazi raid parties to mass-subscribe followers to an offensive tweet in order to *bump* it into the *prosecution zone.* 

Seems to only encourage the drama-addicts to hound people (in a politically correct way of course, mock-feinting from the offense taken all over the sociosphere) they dont like the speech of, more than fix a law whose online section needs scrapping.

Even their world at large seems to be bound up in fate to at least some extent. In the nazi episode Gary still dies and Simon and Alisha still end up together. However, there are a bunch of things that are different such as most of them not having their powers in the nazi episode.

[It didn't work out too well.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8526111/500m-wasted-in-private-treatment-centres-for-NHS.html)   Many trusts are buying back their ISTCs and bringing the work back in house.

For more complicated procedures, you need specialists who have to treat a given number of patients per year to keep their training up.  This is quite difficult for a private healthcare company to do unless they were to run a complete specialist facility. Again they would need a predictable revenue stream  irrespective of how much work they actually did. 

Private hospitals tend to use consultants trained by the NHS, who still work part time for the NHS. This gives the consultants the requisite volume of patients to keep them up to speed. They might have the odd bit of spare capacity for overflow work, but again they couldn't expand further without a predictable revenue stream.

As others have intimated, Oxford letting agents are very hot on making money off deposits, so make sure you take photos on the day you move in and give them a CD of the photos when you hand the inventory sheet in. It'll save a lot of arguing when you come to move out. 

Also make sure that the deposit you pay gets put into the Tenancy Deposit Scheme, they are breaking the law if they put your money in a regular account and make interest off it. 

Similarly make sure that if you are living in a house with 2 or more other people and none of you are related to each other, your house is a registered and inspected HMO (house of multiple occupancy).

1. Grades. Kinda obvious but you need maths and physics. Optionally other sciences, computing or engineering are relevent. But also an unrelated subject can show that you are well rounded and excel at whatever you put you hand to.

2. References. Not really in your control, but having a reference from your teacher that says you are very able, enthusiastic, have an inquiring mind, apply yourself fully, etc. goes down very well.

3. Personal statement. This is where you get a chance to stand out. You need to be excited about science, demonstrate a personal interest, and show that you follow current developments. You should talk about your research experience (projects) and reading that you do in your own time - did you enjoy ""a brief history of time""? Have you attempted to get through ""the Feynman lectures""? You must explain why you are interested in physics and what drives you to study. There is also the opportunity to talk about other interests - music/sport/volunteering/etc. Make yourself memorable.

Interview:

Over skype it's often hard to make an impression. You will be expected to be proficient with equations and calculus, and have a firm grasp of physics. Typical questions are broad and do not tell you all that you need to know or from where to start thinking. They are designed to see how you tackle new situations, evaluate your problem solving skills, and see how you connect the world to it's underlying physics, and then do some maths. Be engaging and enthusiastic, find an angle to attack the problem, then see how far you can go towards an answer.

Campaigners for minimum pricing frequently assert that **alcohol has become more affordable since 1980**. Whilst true, this tells us nothing more than that Britain has enjoyed very significant economic growth in recent decades As a consequence, almost everything has become more affordable and it is to be hoped that almost everything will be still more affordable in 30 years’ time. A more normal measure of calculating prices over time is, of course, to adjust them for inflation. If we do this, we can see that **alcohol has become more expensive in real terms**. The Office for National Statistics reports that the real price of alcohol has risen by almost 20%.

&gt; who don't carry out full credit checks on their customers

Probably because carrying out a full credit check is prohibitively expensive, for a £50 loan. It's more cost-effective for a company to take an educated gamble on limited information, than to expend time and money on researching their customer's credit history. If they were forced to do this, they would pass their costs onto their customer, which would push the interest rate even higher.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"**MOTM - Oscar.** It had to be one of our front 3 IMO, and I thought Oscar was the man today. He was making the tackles, the runs and the passes. His first half run was magical, getting the ball from box to box with beautiful control and gifting the ball to Hazard for an unlucky shot to Buffon's leg. Special mentions to the other two AMs and Petr Cech, who was truly unlucky to concede two soft goals after some wonder saves - not so much about the last goal though.

**Juve have lost 2 in 18 months.** (according to ITV commentators) They are a very strong team at home. This was always going to be the hardest game of the group and to play it during our slump whilst Lampard and Studge are injured just made it worse. Should we be disappointed? Probably not, but it doesn't stop the pain that we could be out of the CL next game.

**We still conceded a soft goal with 5 defenders.** Something needs to be done about our defence. I know Terry is out, but if this is our future after Terry one day retires than I'm not looking forward to it. Someone needs to take Terry's role and hold that god damn line together. To be honest I can't see it being one of our current players unless Cahill becomes a world-beater in a couple of years, so maybe we'll be forced to spend big and maybe even bring in /u/ScreamingGerman 's crush Mats Hummels.

**The False 9 could work if it wasn't first tested against Juve.** I thought the False 9 worked great (Going to have to add a bit to this. Enjoyed the discussion with the others in here) *considering it was our first attempt at it and it was against one of the strongest defensive sides at their home*. Mata, Oscar and Hazard were zipping through the defence on the break and really putting Buffon under pressure. Sadly, Buffon is a beast and Juve is still very strong defensively. I would honestly like to see it tried some more considering Torres is *Torres* and Studge isn't always reliable.
**Edit:** Seem to be getting a lot of flack on this point. Here's my argument. Torres is shit, Sturridge isn't reliable. Until January, what can we do? We can shove Studge up top and hope he sharpens up (Torres is a lost cause to me) or we can play another formation which doesn't require a CF, the False 9. IMO, I will admit the False 9 fell apart in the second half before being replaced by Torres, but I thought when the ball was played along the floor, the connection was great and the creativity was there.

**No comment on Torres.** Unless he manages to score an own goal from their 6 yard box (or even less likely, score) there isn't much point bringing him up anymore. You all know how I feel and we all know how the majority of the subreddit now feels.

**RDM is going to be one of the most written about managers in the world.** The papers were already stating that RDM was ""fighting for his job"" before the game had started. Now we're facing coming out of the CL, the rumours will only keep growing. Expect Pep (Guadiola) Talk on the back of every paper within the next week. **Edit:** Would like to clarify that I support RDM wholly, I just don't expect the papers to.

In terms of interviews and stuff we were offered interview practice at school  but as long as you are able to talk and express yourself well, interviews will be easy. The thing I noticed about people that got through the interview stage was that they were all very interested in their subject. There was a Polish guy in my year who was a positive danger to society but he enjoyed chemistry so much that he could talk for hours on end about stuff he was interested in on and off the syllabus and he got in easy. 

You sound a lot more prepared than I was (and your grades are better) so you may be better able to answer than me but I don't know why private schooled kids might be better at group work. It may be a confidence thing and a simple case that they take charge. That's easy to remedy because when you know the answer force yourself to be more assertive and without being aggressive make sure people listen to you. Having said that, its a very small consideration. Unless your applying to a specific course that interviews with group work they will be individual interviews where they will be interested to see how you react to situations and new ideas while also (if your applying for a subject you currently do in college) making sure you know your subject. I applied for law so I was not tested on that because I never took it at A2. 

Don't feel intimidated by private schooled kids. You have better grades than 99%+ (not exaggerating) of my year and if you've applied for internships or even a job your ahead of the vast majority of my year.

* The vote was on a compromise ruling, better to have all or nothing.

* Certainly not a disgrace, as it's a standard majority voting principle, if the people in the church don't want it it's hardly disgraceful that they shouldn't have it.

* Bits of the bible can be interpreted as being anti women-bishops, this result will (hopefully) force the CoE to get a proper consensus on the issue and close the gap between the priesthood and laity's views.

I'm not that much in favour of it, but I don't think the vote's outcome is a disgrace and I think in the long run it could well end up being a good thing, a milestone from which the CoE can reassess this issue.

What I also think is good is that the bishops appear to have a clear agreement on this: bishops can/should be women.  They don't deserve any blame for being anti-women or anti-change, and it's good that the vote has pointed out many of the laity believe this, not necessarily the leadership.

I recently claimed for a bit between jobs and when I went to sign off apparently they cancelled me for not attending rather than correctly dealing with my declaration that I was signing off and failed to pay the last 12 days. Which is a thing worth fighting for when you don't get paid until 6 weeks into the job. I had a long and unpleasant fight with them which I won't go into but included a man who told me not only that I couldn't get is sorted out quickly but that I couldn't ask for it to be looked at again except via a formal appeal on a formal appeal form. He would not listen when told he was wrong, when I read their own letter stating I had a right of review to him, or when I pointed out the job I'd been doing before claiming. (It was resolved without a formal appeal, in 24 hours once I went to the local office and got a decent human being, and the subsequent complaint including this and other issues with their call centre led to them paying me compensation).

Even when they are helpful they can be ignorant - we used to get case after case where they intercepted European people and prevented them claiming JSA because they could claim income support as single parents. Except that they then wouldn't qualify for immigration reasons (doesn't count as exercising a treaty right). 

And even when they are helpful and good - they can't ever be independent. 

My view is - Not necessarily. 

What do you mean by ""together"" ?

If you were 2 people sharing a house who happen to also have sex - and do not share their finances - then you are not a couple. 

If you like to keep control of your own finances but are still, well, a couple .... you're a couple. 

It depends what you mean by financially independent. A lot of couples don't want to rely on each other financially, don't share bank accounts or assume the other one will pay. Very few couples don't pool resources at all, you may be both paying for shopping but you're likely to be shopping or making shopping lists together, and cooking or meal planning together. You might both contribute financially to laundry but it's likely you're washing your clothes together - etc.

If you're describing yourselves as a couple or ""together"" you're more than half way to losing the argument I think. 

But it is possible to have some non traditional sexual ongoing relationship and not count (and that's without considering that they only recognise couples - the benefit system doesn't recognise polygamy...I wonder how successful you'd be just sharing all the domestic planning with a third person in a three room house and arguing there was no difference in relationship other than sex which isn't itself something that can determine the matter...).

It's also possible to claim separately if you are married if you are living apart for more than 12 months. It can be very difficult to persuade them you are doing this until 12 months has passed, but it is legitimate. You can be married, have an ongoing stable relationship and plan to stay together - but if you live in separate houses and will be doing so for more than 12 months you can claim as a single person.",0,1353451087,null,0,false,0,c74feym,t3_13g7s1,t1_c74feym,t1_c73we90,null,1430459278,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I can only speak for the Cambridge engineering admissions, but the entry criteria for Oxbridge come across as different from some other top end unis. The generally accepted line is ""we want to take the students who will likely have the most success during the course."" So, we were told they do not take extra curricular activities into account, although doing some shows ""spare capacity"" (i.e. you're not dedicating your entire life to your A level grades). Similar with work experience - even for engineering, it's not necessary for admission to the course (although you are required to get some during. Medicine is a major exception to this rule.

Generally they take people who have a good ability to think about problems - you could be a high A* grade student, but if the interview shows you've been learning everything by rote without understanding it, it doesn't reflect well.

Ever since Wills and Kate thrilled the whole world by announcing their engagement, I've been beside myself with excitement, much more than with any event I've ever known or heard of, or could hope to experience for myself. I've dreamt of being Kate's bridesmaid, of our future queen confiding in me all the hopes of her girlish, joyous, bleeding love. How my soul would sigh to hear from her own royal lips the fairytale delight of her wooing by her handsome-ish prince. Alas, my cat ate the invite, so here instead we have the next best thing - William and Kate: The Movie!!! :) Squeal !!!! :D

Make no mistake - this is not some cheesy straight-to-DVD job. This is the most anticipated film of the decade - it could change your life! The cast is stellar. Hugh Grant badly coveted the role of Wills, but was sent packing for being too old to play a student, even by Hollywood standards. Many doubt Grant will ever recover from the despondency into which this rejection has plunged him. Instead the part went to hitherto unknown wotshisname, who will surely now be catapulted to superstardom. A master of the gurn, he pulls some of the most oscar-worthy faces ever witnessed by non-cinema-going audiences.

As for Camilla Luddlington-Bowles, you could actually believe Kate Middleton is inside your TV, tossing her hair around. Luddlington-Bowles plays the part with all the high school cheerleader sass of the real Waity. It really is uncanny.

And let's not forget to mention - dazzled by these bright young stars - veteran hand-puppeteer Ben Cross in his first head-and-shoulders-knees-and-toes role since his career prior to 80s cult classic Fingermouse. Cross, still faithful to the form of acting he loves best, captures the hand gestures of Prince Charles - the thing with the thumbs - so convincingly you'll be scooping your chin up off the floor. He's come a long way since that pile of old tosh, Chariots of Fire.

I Hate loosing

**Secondly**

Di Matteo call to drop Torres today was ballsy and right, Looking at Torres recent form, It didn't justify his inclusion in today game.

**Thirdly**

The defensive formation was one of the worst I've ever seen a team play, [This was how we was suppose to look while defending today](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1067952/Chelsea_shape_vs_Barca_medium.png), Instead today we were not in any formation while defending, Players were just scatter everywhere on the filed. ( Two deflection ) Mikel and Ramires look clueless when we're defending because the weren't give any specifics on what the hell we were doing. And the ended up pushing the back four way into Petr Cech little six yard box for majority of the game 

**Fourth**

We need more experience in the squad for games and times like this or we need someone to step up and be that guy that the team can look up to for inspiration. Give Ashley Cole, John Terry and Frank Lampard 3 more years and lift whatsoever ban they have on Malouda. From this point on it's either make or break for us, so we will need every bit of experience, we need those been there done that players back even if they are not regular.

**Fifth** 

We need another striker Falcao, Cavani, Lendowski, Little Pea, Me, You. we just need somebody that can put the ball into the back of the net and do it on a consistent basis. We probably will need 2 to match City, United, Arsenal (yes Arsenal) and other European teams.

**Lastly**

Di Matteo need to stop plugging players in and hoping for the best, He need to change the formation rotate players more often. Rest Mikel, Hazard, Oscar, Torres ( Not yet ) and bring in Marin, Romeu and other subs. 

We're still in the Champions League as of now, and four points behind City, We're reaching the panic zone fast If something is not done soon we will be out of Europe and Mile behind the to Manchester silly nannies before we realized it.

to be fair, it doesn't seem like RDM looks comfortable outside his 4231 and i don't think its a format that suits what these players should be doing. frankly a 433 with mikel deep and ramires and oscar providing passes and runs with wingers mata/hazard would suit a counterattacking style way better, and that is when we've caused the most damage this season, on the counter. our wingers don't track back out of laziness or exhaustion, it doesn't matter, they still don't. so if thats the case, which you can see in the past few games, then put 3 in the middle to provide protection as well as outlets. frankly torres not playing tonight, or anyone that can head the ball for that matter, caused the loss of possession alot, and in the second half specifically, never really looked like scoring. i think not having someone to run directly at their back line proved to be a huge sticking point, as when oscar/hazard/mata got near the box the just kept passing it around with no one really looking like they'd take charge to play that hitman role, other than the odd speculative shot.

this current slump isn't down to our apparent lack of a striker, but more to do with how we set up, how rigid our formation is, and everyones apparent uncertainty in it. i'd like di matteo to stay the year, but he needs to do some homework or we're going to keep getting picked apart by anyone with a decent team. i fear going to goodison.",0,1353454493,null,0,false,0,c74gce9,t3_13j3d0,t1_c74gce9,t3_13j3d0,null,1430459714,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

True enough, but sometimes it's worth letting people know that stuff like this is an important issue of equality, but yes these things don't often bother people unless they're the ones not-being-equal.

Equal marriage, for example: You'll often see people saying ""What's the big deal? There are more important things to worry about, like the economy."" As well as being a distraction from the issue - different government departments do different things, by design - it's a really iffy attitude. I doubt it'll take much research to turn up people saying that with regard to women's suffrage 100 years back.

I'm with you on the hope aspect.

The same speed test on LTE. That won't blow the allowance.

My point was that most things will have the same drain on a data allowance on either technology. A 15 megabyte powerpoint presentation will take 15 megabytes of allowance on LTE or HSPA. But it should allow the user to download that 15 megabytes much faster.

LTE is not really as good as people seem to believe, at least not yet. It doesn't provide a massive capacity increase over the latest version of HSPA (it depends what EE are doing in terms of spectrum allocation as it has to share with GSM, how much MIMO, etc) and so you're not going to see them offering totally unlimited data plans for the minimum possible cost any time soon.

Having said that some of their pricing strategy is clearly ""We're the only ones with LTE so we're going to gouge a bit"". I guess EE don't realise that there are going to be very few people who are absolutely itching to get LTE and are willing to pay the launch prices.

Yeah, and that cheapness shows. Giffgaff is riddled with various issues, has little actual customer service (just idiots trying to peddle their SIM cards so that they get credit), and it's piggybacking (and owned by) a network that has chosen to invest very little in providing 3G coverage (including being told off by Ofcom for it) and where the network is notorious for having massive outages with surprising regularity. No other network has had two crippling outages within about 3 months of each other, plus constant data outages during the iPhone craze, etc.

A better example would be 3 who I think offer unlimited data for a bit more per month, but have dramatically more 3G coverage (as a percentage of population) and whose network seems reliable enough (signal issues aside)

I'll stick to my T-Mobile plan which is actually cheaper and pretty much as unlimited (there is a nominal FUP but in practice all they do is stop you using YouTube), where I actually get to use 3G more than 5 minutes per day, and where the network has never completely failed.

true,pieninja,null,null,"Not a stupid question at all. In fact, a question integral to how Hitler maintained his power and created his military strength.
  
The nazi's political power was largely founded on the SA 'Sturmabteilung' - literally the 'assault department'. It was basically a paramilitary organisation that acted as the enforcers of the nazi's through physical force and violence. This started as a small group of ex-soldiers acting as glorified bouncers at nazi rallies (kicking out dissenters, communists and any other 'undesirables' present) but quickly grew into a far more powerful force used to violently intimidate opponents and take part in full blown street warfare. Now, this was not all that strange in Germany at the time - the communists and social-democrats and other parties also had their [own enforcers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotfrontkämpferbund). It was simply necessary for any party to have something like this, in the charged political environment of the Weimar republic. What set the SA apart though, was that it was ... a tad more violent and effective, thanks to its fascist ethos and the way in which Hitler actively used them to subvert a normal democratic process.  
  
The (more famous?) SS or 'Schutzstaffel ' (Protection Squad), started out as a sub-division of the SA. The SS was originally formed to be Hitler's private bodyguard. Because, you know, a dictator really needs his own goon squad. However, the SS slowly grew more powerful, and more powerful, and more powerfulm because (duh) it had close connections to the leadership of the party. Basically, Hitler could trust the SS more than other nazi groups, because they depended on him, and he depended on them. It really was 'his' club.  
  
After the start of the nazi party after WW1, and their ascendancy to power shortly before WW2, the SA grew very rapidly. It managed to attract many former soldiers, discontent citizens, etc. In fact it grew so rapidly, that it became far bigger than the 'real' German army - the Reichswehr. So now Hitler had an armed force of his own, that he rapidly enlarged and used as his private nazi army.   

But the SA grew so much, that it eventually became too powerful for Hitler - in effect the bosses of the SA became dangerous competitors to his own power within the nazi party
  
But, like we already said, besides the SS/SA, Germany already had a regular army, which during the nazi-period was known as the Wehrmacht, but during the time we speak of, it was still named the 'Reichswehr'. The Reichswehr was the regular army, and traced its lineage mostly to the Prussian state, an ancient, independent German sub-state, that eventually succeeded in unifying all of Germany under its rule in the 19th century. After the first world war, when Germany lost, the Prussian/German emperor was removed from power, and the victorious French and British prohibited the Reichswehr from growing beyond +-100.000 soldiers.  
However,the leadership of the army was still largely made up of (former) aristocrats, the very same class that had ruled Prussia and Germany before WW1. Clearly, these aristocrats didn't like their loss of power, and they certainly didn't like the fact that the SA was now far more powerful than them.

Especially because the nazi party was a *populist nationalist* party (hence their name: National Socialists, as opposed to the 'international' communists and the 'elite' aristocrats), so the nazi's and especially the SA didn't get on too well with the 'Junker' aristocrats. The aristocrats weren't so much inclusively nationalist as exclusively nationalist: the army leadership believed in German nationalism *under a limited class of aristocrats*.  
  
So now Hitler had to deal with a dual problem. On the one hand he had an SA army that was no longer loyal enough to him, and was a threat to him because of its power.  On the other hand, he had a smaller 'real' army that was pissed off that it was so small, didn't really like the nazi ideology, and was especially very, very jealous of the newly powerful SA...  
  
Which is when Hitler had a bright idea. In fact, a master stroke. He decided to play the two armies off each other, with the SS as the lynch pin. This is know as the 'Night of the long knives'.

Basically, he decided to do something about the powerful SA, and the disloyal Reichswehr in one stroke... in a stereotypically fascist way. That is, he simply made a deal with the Reichswehr, promising them power, making them loyal to him, and then he had members of the Reichswehr abd the SS [murder the SA leadership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives), after which he made the SS the powerful arm of the party, and put what was left of the SA under the Reichswehr, which he renamed to 'Wehrmacht'.
  
In this manner, Hitler used the SS to enforce his will, make the 'regular' army loyal to him, and decapitated the SA so it didn't become too powerful. Then he enrolled the SA into the regular army, making the German army suddenly very powerful - after secretly building up that strength within the SA, so he didn't break any of the treaties with the English and French.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"There is generally a valid purpose for having appointed rather than elected individuals in government - so long as the process to appoint them is sufficiently selective and rigorous (which IMO it is not at the moment - certainly there should be no hereditary peers).

Since they have no strict party allegiance, they may provide more reasoned debate on divisive issues than the Commons, which frequently fractures along party lines and vested interests.. The Lords can also act as an organ of inertia, putting the breaks on any particularly radical legislation and providing an additional forum for debate.  They prevent a party with a clear majority from steam roll legislation.

Their powers today are severely limited - all they can really do is propose legislation (which the Commons has complete ability to veto or amend - it's just a secondary point of entry) or delay (most) bills by up to two years.  The latter power is important - it forces public debate, gives the media time to consider an issue and prevents a law from being forced through without due thought.  Two years is not always long enough to delay until an election, but it is long enough to delay until the run up to an election, when the Commons should be more conscious of the electorate.

They're certainly not a threat of any sort, and are a useful balance to the absolute power of the Commons.  It's not hard to see when this could be useful - perhaps a politically motivated power grab during a time of crisis, or an ill-conceived remedy to temporary public outrage.

I think there's a great deal of merit to the function of the House of Lords, but we certainly need to take steps to improve its composition.  Something comparable to the Supreme Court would be a drastic improvement.  Ideally it would be a mix of educated and worldly people from a range of fields, providing strong candidates for the various Parliamentary committees and a meritocratic - rather than purely populist - forum for debate.",0,1353459702,null,0,false,0,c74hooc,t3_13iqlk,t1_c74hooc,t1_c74edm0,null,1430460340,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

**Harry Redknapp says Cazorla has been the player of the season so far... but what about Suarez, Van Persie and co? Sportsmail's experts gives their verdict**

Appearing as a pundit on Match of the Day last weekend, former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp argued that Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla has been the player of the Premier League season so far. The Spaniard has undoubtedly been a revelation at the Emirates this season, but there are plenty of other worthy candidates for the mantle. Here, Sportsmail's finest argue the case for the player that has wowed them the most over the last few months...


Neil Ashton - Luis Suarez (Liverpool)

He has put his past troubles behind him to become the driving force for Liverpool and the leading goalscorer in the Barclays Premier League with 10 already. Although opponents frequently complain of simulation, he appears unruffled and unaffected. A top player at the top of his game.

Matt Barlow - Juan Mata (Chelsea)

Beautifully balanced and easy on the eye and, perhaps more importantly, influential. Mata has eclipsed Chelsea's expensive new signings with his energy and vision, scoring and creating goals.

Laura Williamson - Robin van Persie (Man United)

Eight goals in 12 Premier League appearances (10 starts) for the Dutchman since his move from Arsenal. What happened to taking time to settle in at a new club? An honourable mention, too, to Steven Fletcher, whose superb finishing has produced six of Sunderland’s 10 league goals so far this season.



Ian Ladyman - Luis Suarez

The Uruguayan has much to learn about his conduct on the field but his football has been absolutely spellbinding. On current form he would get in any Premier League team and most in Europe. That just about sums it up. 

Sami Mokbel - Luis Suarez

The expression 'one-man team' is disrespectful to the man in question's team-mates. But just where would Liverpool be without their brilliant Uruguayan? Simple, in a relegation battle. He has carried Brendan Rodgers' side this season in the way Steven Gerrard used to. Scores all types of goals. God help Liverpool should he get injured, or even worse, leave. 

Riath Al-Samarrai - Michu (Swansea)

I interviewed him a couple of weeks into the season and he could barely sit still when talking about Cazorla, his former Oviedo team-mate with those wonderful feet. My view, possibly skewed by watching so many Swansea matches, is that Michu has made the same, if not more, impact. It’s about far more than numbers, although they tell you he has scored seven times in 12 Premier League games, and six of those have been decisive to results. 


Dominic King - Luis Suarez

If I nominated the Liverpool striker as being the third best player in the world in print on Saturday, he can be my only choice for the best in the Premier League right now. Is playing at the peak of his powers, keeping Liverpool afloat and terrifying defenders. Top of the scoring charts and would be no surprise if he stays there.

John Edwards - Marouane Fellaini (Everton)

From heading Everton to victory in their opener against Manchester United to drilling a low shot through a crowded area to inspire a 2-1 win over Sunderland in their last home game, Belgium’s finest has looked the complete midfielder. An ability to control the ball on his chest and screen it from a defender at the same time has also contributed to Gary Neville recently calling him ‘unplayable’ on his day. There are others with strong claims, not least Robin Van Persie and Luis Suarez, but Felli’s the feller for me.


Neil Moxley - Luis Suarez

I really enjoy watching this fella play. He is such a clever, talented and dangerous forward. I know that his conversion rate is not the greatest. But neither is Wayne Rooney's. But if you look at his movement, his alertness and his goal-sense, he's right up there. There are some aspects to his character that it's difficult to warm to. He dives, ergo he cheats. With blanket television coverage, it would help if he cut that out. But as for the rest of it, carry on Luis. Please.

Lee Clayton - Luis Suarez

I would have picked Cazorla, because his is the single individual performance I have most enjoyed in the flesh. He dazzled West Ham. But he has been hot and cold in other games, whereas Suarez has carried his club. They really are a one man team this season and, while Liverpool are trying to escape mid-table, Suarez has scored 13 goals in all competitions already: in an average team, packed with kids. He's not popular, but he is brilliant.

Mark Alford - Leighton Baines (Everton)

Brilliant for Everton, solid for England. his ability to manipulate a football and cause havoc down the left with Steven Pienaar thrills every match. Tough in the tackle and skilful with his crossing, he's the main reason Everton have started well (for once).


Colin Young - Luis Suarez

He may not be everyone’s cup of tea, and there is a sinister side to him which is not welcome in the Premier League, but what a player. Suarez has added goals to his world class repertoire this season, and brilliant goals at that, which is just as well for Liverpool. Where would they be without him? 

Matt Lawless - Raheem Sterling (Liverpool)

One word was all that was needed to kick Raheem Sterling into shape this summer: steady. It was followed by a terse warning from his new Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers who told the teenager, in no uncertain terms, to improve his attitude. That incident happened at Harvard University and provided the ultimate lesson for the prodigious 17-year-old. Yes, Luis Suarez is Liverpool's man of the moment but, for me, it's been the young winger who has been their stand-out performer. I should add that Eden Hazard, Edin Dzeko (super sub), Shane Long and Kevin Nolan deserve a mention too.


Matt Fortune - Mousa Dembele (Tottenham)

He's not been the most electric performer in the Premier League this season, but the influence of Mousa Dembele at Tottenham makes him perhaps the most invaluable. Since the Belgian was sidelined by injury, Tottenham have won just one in the Premier League - away at Southampton - having won five on the spin with him at the heart of all their play. He has filled the void left by Luka Modric with ease - at less than half the cost - and looked significantly more of a threat on goal than the deep-lying Croat ever did. His return to fitness can't come soon enough for Andre Villas-Boas.


Tony Moore - Santi Cazorla (Arsenal)

He could get in any team in the Premier League. He plays football the right way, it's comes so easy to him. His passing, his balance, his link up play; he makes the ball talk. I loved watching him at West Ham. His play put a smile on my face, he was one step ahead of everyone else on the pitch.

It's sensational that you would tell a Liverpool fan he is 'disrespecting' a player who abandoned the club for Chelsea (do you have any perception of the relationship between the two clubs?). The suggestion that Torres has done a lot for the club (the club which made him) is bordering on the idiotic. It's a waste of time to go into more detail to be honest, all I will say is: get a grip.

Let me just add though, on further inspection of your previous post, the 'soccernomics' quip is completely ignorant of context and what this club needs. If anyone actually believes we should 'take the risk' on Torres, when there are dozens of other clubs whose interest will compete with ours (and therefore raise his price and demand), then they don't understand that this club can't afford more risks in the transfer market; we're not in a comfortable position. Even if Torres wasn't abhorred by most non-American Liverpool fans the idea would be daft. We are not PSG.

Coupled with Luiz being a defensive nightmate they're just running riot there. Plus, MAZACR don't provide enough assistance at the back which creates even more trouble with having a unified defensive structure.

What I don't understand is why there was this emphasis on booting it up to Hazard. The guy is 5'nothing and is no aerial threat like Drogba. It clearly wasn't working and just turned the ball over to Juventus. If we wanted to play with this formation we should have done what Barca do and used the 4-3-3, problem was, there was no build up time to get the players used to this formation.

This really highlights the lack of foresight by our recruiters and only having two strikers. One has been injured or unavailable for the better part of the current season and the other has lost his mojo. The over recruitment in our midfield has caused the issue and it's biting us in the arse as we can't fit all the talent.

I don't think recalling Lukaku in the winter is the right answer, he's doing fine at WBA (who by the way are playing excellent football and are punching well above their weight, so it's a great learning environment for him). But we need to get another striker in, this doesn't have to be Falcao, we could easily play a 4-4-2 or a 4-4-1-1 with the new striker and Torres/Sturridge.",0,1353463821,null,0,false,0,c74insb,t3_13j3d0,t1_c74insb,t1_c74ecpc,null,1430460803,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

This would meet the charging standard for section 5, yet no offence is committed because it's toward a police officer.  Why should you be able to talk to your fellow man like that?

Scenario B) Someone displays text from the New Testament on a screen in their Christian cafe (Lancashire) and is warned about an offence.

Does scenario A not constitute a more serious threat than B? The reform is needed to ensure that Scenario A is dealt with and B is not.

true,tzxn3,uk,United Kingdom,"My (private) school had shorter terms (no summer courses, either).

I think the main difference is, private schools have the money to get the best teachers, so the best teachers end up teaching at private schools.

Not that every teacher was great, but even the relatively crap ones had a clear idea of exactly what information they had to get into everyone's heads before exam time. And in the UK's education system, that's what's important.

Also, as private schools are allowed to select based on ability, while state schools are not, this inevitably biases private schools' performance upwards. Every year my school expelled those who didn't perform to the (actually fairly lax) standards expected.

And there's also the fact that in a classroom with one teacher, that teacher will target their lesson towards the average ability level of their students, so in a state school environment, people who are intelligent but not terribly self-motivated simply won't be challenged as much.

This also brings me onto the point that in my experience with friends and family members going to state school, state schools are under pressure to invest nearly all their spare resources in pushing the students who are predicted D grades to get Cs in their exams, in order to satisfy the central government's ""5 A*-C at GCSE for every student"" target.

Still, I think Suarez is currently a better player and far more important to his team than Iniesta at the moment. Falcao is an interesting case. He's scoring goals like no one's business. That said, goals are probably the only thing he brings to his team. He's a classical number 9, but doesn't have the technical skill with the ball that players like Messi, Ronaldo, and Suarez have.

If the person is already interested to watch, start at Rose or The End of the World (s01e02). If they really want to start at the start it'll be Rose, but that always comes with a warning of suckiness. The End of the World is a fantastic episode and I find most people are already hooked, if not The Unquiet Dead will usually catch them. After that I always tell people to skip Aliens of London and World War 3 as they're absolutely terrible, but Dalek is amazing and cannot be skipped. The Long Game is worth watching, if for no other reason than Simon Pegg's performance. Father's Day I see as optional, same with Boom Town, obviously Empty Child/Doctor Dances &amp; Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways are essential. From then on they should just watch every episode IMO.

If the person is unsure, I usually just show them an episode which is fairly self-contained story-wise, Blink is the classic option, though personally I prefer Dalek for 9, The Impossible Planet/Satan pit for 10 or Vincent &amp; The Doctor for 11.

Alternatively, I know some people don't really like the 9th Doctor, in which case I usually get them to start from The Christmas Invasion.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;the historical precedent is that all successful civilisations have developed ideas of ownership and individual property rights. As it appears that group selection applies on tribal/national levels, it seems to speak against such systems working beyond small, tribal groups.

Many/most anthropologists would disagree with you.  Anarchy Works by Gelderloos lists a substantial number of historical and contemporary societies run along anarchistic lines, indeed, historically speaking, Western style individualism has been the exception rather than the rule.  Capitalism's dominance for the last several hundred years has tended to erase this reality, as is often the case with history written by the winners.

&gt;You're using ""capitalist"" as a synonym for ""how things work right now"", when I'm talking about the necessity of effective law to deliver the best use of capitalist economics.

I'm certainly using capitalism as a synonym for how capitalism operates in all places now, and has at all times during its history.  If we're talking about some hypothetical capitalism drawn from a libertarian or anarcho-capitalist wet-dream, or from the pages of a theoretical text, then I fear there won't be much meeting of minds.  I prefer to deal with reality, albeit you may view my ideology as utopian!

&gt;It only takes a moment's reflection to realise how badly wrong that can go as soon as people are even vaguely emotional.

Buy why should people, especially ones who've taken the time to democratically agree some even-handed process, necessarily be any more (or less) emotional than a judge?  Indeed, isn't it likely that the mean of a cross-section of opinion should be less partial and prone to strong emotion than that of a single judge, however highly regarded s/he may be, and whatever rarefied circles s/he moves in?

&gt;imagine how quickly any perceived ""paedo"" would be strung up and murdered by mobs if there was no rule of law.

Who says there would be no rule of law?  Only you.  Most anarchists believe in rules, it's simply that they wish to agree laws democratically, and such that they are egalitarian and locally relevant.

&gt;Mobs do not act rationally, they act on instinct and emotion.

This is merely an assertion, based on a popular but wrong-headed conception of anarchy as chaos and disorder.

&gt;since people are easily mislead by Rhetoric and emotional appeals.

Are you ""easily mislead by rhetoric and emotional appeals""?  If not, why do you consider that others are?  Are you better than the unwashed masses?  Indeed, if large numbers of people are vulnerable to this, how much more are small groups of so-called elites?  If you don't trust the majority, how can you possibly trust a minority?  And yet you do, and look how profoundly they've screwed things up trying to run everything for their own ends.

&gt;Even the most cursory examination of modern politics proves this point over and over again.

See above, and add to it that the current political and economic system and the culture which is built on it is everywhere designed to sponsor such infantilism and passivity.

&gt;For majority consensus to work you'd need fully rational, fully informed individuals, which is an extremely tall order for human beings.

Anarchism is certainly about more than freeing people from constraints, it is also very much about equipping them with the means, education, social milieu, upbringing and confidence to take responsibility for their own lives and to work together in a mutual supportive manner to face challenges.  It's about strengthening and trusting humanity, rather than weakening and fearing it.

&gt;Additionally, it seems to me that the majority would rarely be interested in getting involved in decision making: For example I don't care about issues effecting farmers as I am not a farmer, therefore in any hypothetical anarchist system, I would not get involved in decision making concerning them. Therefore in such a situation it is only minority interests who would be involved in the decision making, and we come full circle back to the point where decisions are taken by minority groups for their interests rather than the interests of the whole.

In a participatory and consensus-based direct democracy or anarchist system, people would always have  voice where they wished one, but their voice would be strongest in those issues on which they were an authority (not in authority, but an authority), or where their own interests were directly in play.  If a decision affects you, your voice should be heard loud and clear, where it doesn't, there is no need - you can't dictate how I should dress today or what I should eat, but you can decide (alongside your fellow workers) the hours of your working and at what task you shall work, how you will deal with the fruits of your labour etc.

&gt;enjoying (most) of the fruits of that labour

Would that even _that_ were possible for the vast majority under capitalism!

&gt;I'd rather appoint somebody who I'm reasonably confident in to keep track of that stuff and work in what would (hopefully) be my best interests.

Although such appointments are undoubtedly viewed sceptically by anarchists, it's not something which doesn't happen.  All authority is subjected to relentless criticism from below, but delegation for specific tasks over specific periods with clear strong mandates and an absolute right of recall are considered acceptable by most anarchists.

&gt;Again, this is not against 'the rules' of capitalism (worker-owned companies)

Yes it is, at least, it is as capitalism has always been defined by socialists.  Insofar as you accept such arrangements, you're accepting socialism, and you and I cease to to have any conflict on the matter.  Capitalism, at heart, as I say, is the alienation of the producer from the produced.

&gt;Many small high tech firms work in similar manners. 

Correct.  Many entrepreneurial outfits in modern high tech businesses are basically anarcho-communist or anarcho-socialist in design, which is amusingly ironic.

&gt;which our current capitalist system is based heavily on.

This I would dispute.  In many of the most salient ways, our modern incarnation of capitalism looks a lot like the earlier mercantilist one which Adam Smith was revolting against, with intellectual property and so-called ""free-trade"" agreements in place of the tariffs that Smith so despised.  I've said before, I've a lot of sympathy for Smith, as did Marx who rated him highly in his *Theories of Surplus Value*, and based his *Capital* in part on extending Smith's ideas and taking them to their logical conclusion, one which most classical economists feared and worked hard to obfuscate (i.e. socialism).

&gt;But if ethical capitalism cannot succeed due to the selfishness of the people, how could anarchism? Capitalism is after all the system designed to redirect selfishness to better ends. Anarchism seems to rely heavily on the good of people and their ability to work together to achieve desirable outcomes. 

This is where we most clearly diverge then.  I don't see capitalism as a ""system designed to redirect selfishness to better ends"", I see it as a system designed to celebrate and reinforce selfishness.  Without it, I believe humanity is destined for better things.  I think we're better than capitalism, not the other way round.

Edit:  Of course you are welcome to reply, but I think we've probably taken this thread as far as we usefully can.  At least, I think it's probably taken up enough of both of our time, and I doubt anyone else is reading it now!",0,1353477324,null,0,1353477743,0,c74lsnm,t3_12sgtp,t1_c74lsnm,t1_c747ifj,null,1430462354,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a peculiar argument that you are making. You are saying to stop a centralisation of power we need a centralisation of power. Having said that I am not adverse to paradoxes in principle. Ultimately the negative type of power you are talking about is the ability to farm people, whether that is to raise armies or profit—the ability to amplify one's will through many.

Such a centralisation of power (even to prevent the bad kind) has the requirement of never being repurposed to become the bad kind. It seems prudent to design systems that have immunity in the first place. We've tried statehood for over two thousand years and it never really ends well, and we haven't really understood why. If we look to US aggression (and to a lesser extent the UK) we see that the problem persists. There's no easy answers, and to have a knee-jerk derisory reaction is in no way helpful.

&gt; absence of an effective restraint

Restraint by design is better than wilful restraint and anarchistic systems would have this built in. Your faith in such a benevolent dictator is actually the naive position.

&gt; Like it as not, within your egalitarian society there will be those with the drive and the ability to accrue power for their own ends

The second paragraph was a little hard to understand but I think I get the gist. I don't mind asymmetries of power, they're inevitable. The problem for me is the ability to continue that power past the point of utility and across generations. Corporations, religion, monarchy, and the nationstate are all manifestations of this idea. They perpetuate the idea of supremacy—economic, military, and moral, but most importantly the ""legitimate"" ownership of people. Statism is currently just a combination of these constructs and it is absurd to say that there exists the public and private sector, because that is a gross over simplification—where one ends and the other begins is as undefined as the waist. It's a nebulous concept that doesn't make sense without a wider context (torso, legs, body, gravity, biology).

The state itself acts like a faceless private centralisation of power. I'd suggest it is through state constructs like mass media and deliberately poor education where parents are forced to orphan their children in many respects to the state, that the physical and intellectual potential of the general public is kept at a useful minimum. Corporations do this with advertising and a menial division of labour. Religion does this through dogma. The military does this again with dogma and just enough education to perform. Each institution gets its power through the disempowerment of the individual through misinformation, and when that fails various levels of violence.

The state has always been a construct by and for the most powerful, even today's so called democratic parliament. A large state is required to enforce corporate law, copyright law, patents, and then to send in the army to secure resources in remote locations. This is still happening today.",0,1353479828,null,0,false,0,c74m9x8,t3_13i6xp,t1_c74m9x8,t1_c74ec55,null,1435666144,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It isn't just the poor Champions League campaign, though that has been the most obvious symptom of the fatal flaw; RDM cannot organise a defence. We've been leaking goals left, right and centre all during his tenure (with the exception of the 10 men behind the ball performances against Barca and Bayern). ITV came up with a good stat; Cahill and Luiz have conceded 20 goals in their last 10 games. It's obvious if you watch them that something isn't working and they aren't a partnership yet, but maybe Robbie has no answers. Also saw players pointing the finger at one another on the pitch yesterday, it seems they were just thrown in to a new formation in the hope that 5 defenders would be more secure than 4. That didn't work and it looked as if the players had no idea where they were supposed to be

It seems unthinkable that he'd be sacked without a meeting at which certain questions were asked. How will you tighten up the defence, how will you rectify the lack of physicality in midfield, what is your plan B in attacking midfield and how will you handle the striker situation? Without being harsh, these are all questions we've been asking for a long time and neither AVB or RDM apparently had the answers

What I don't understand is the timing, unless he completely lost the dressing room in which case it's the only option. We're not going to get Pep or Mourinho (my ideal candidate) in November and if Benitez is hired as an interim I will have to seriously consider how much effort I make to go to Chelsea games this season.

If you're asking what a *fair* system would be, free from any arbitrary and biased value judgements, then I would suggest first come first served.  There is a list of people waiting for organ donation, when it becomes apparent that a patient needs an organ then the name goes on the list regardless of anything else.  The alternative to this system involves having to actually choose to put someone in harms way to potentially save someone you think more worthy.  For example.  Patient A comes in first, 40 years old, heavy alcoholic, needs a new liver.  Fine, you say, there will be one available in two days so I'll put you down to recieve it.  But on day 2 Patient B comes in.  Patient B is an otherwise healthy 19 year old who also needs a liver.  There's only one to give and you've already promised it to Patient A.  If you decide that Patient B is more deserving of the liver then you have to effectively kill Patient A in order to save B.  Patient A simply had the misfortune of needing a liver at the same time as someone else who you thought was a better person and more deserving.

And if we're going to judge people on their ability to breathe longer why not open and judge their character too?  What if Patient B was a convicted murderer and A was a nurse?

Most chelsea fans believe getting a new striker will fix things it will not

Chelsea look poor in defense everyone was quick to jump on torres's back and call for his head do we do the same with luiz as much as scoring goals is the bench mark for a striker so is clean sheets for defenders now I actually believe we should continue with luiz because I do think he could become easily one of the best CB's in the world

Our build up from defense to attack is often poor unless it is a counter attack we look really sluggish and cant play vs any team who defends with a deep line of defense if you watch us vs tottenham we get good opportunities because they play a high line and they had Gallas in there team

Our attacking trio as good as they can be have not gelled they have showed glimpses but its not working at the moment we don't retain enough possession of the ball to relieve our defenders and to tire the enemy defenders 

Does anyone expect to win games when the defense is not working/making mistakes, the midfield still looks disconnected and not producing much and have out of form strikers now these may or not be RDM's fault

Added to that is the fact that Benitez is the only manager to get Abramovich's 50m plaything to succeed in England.

It's a good move for Rafa as well - I'm pretty sure that he realises now that there isn't a place for him at Liverpool (anytime soon, at least). The Chelsea job gives him the high profile club job he's looking for, transfer funds to play with, and he can reestablish his credentials and remind everyone how damn good a manager he is.

You know, I don't really go with the ""it's pretty much indisputable [that he] had sex with lots of under-age people"".  He admitted to the episode in his autobiography which I refer to above, and it should've been reported and investigated at the time (maybe it was).  That investigation may have discovered it was a fabrication of his own mind - we'll probably never know - I think it probably did happen as he recounts, going on what has been said by so many people over the past few months.

I think the ongoing investigations will probably find that he should've been charged with many offenses and that there are a lot of people who should've done more to protect the children who got in harm's way, but I don't think things are indisputable facts until the investigations are over and we know the truth.

I think there is a danger that if we all accept that Jimmy Savile was the big-bad-bogey-man, a lot of guilty people are let off the hook, and they shouldn't be.  The agent who hawked that autobiography around the publishers should be prosecuted, as should the publishers and every single person who read it (ok, that's a little extreme, but I'm trying to make a point) and didn't report what was said to the police.  Throw in all the producers, colleagues, performers, hairdressers, make-up artists and the rest who are making noises that they knew it was going on and there is a big list of people who need to be held to account.

true,YeahBruvInit,uk,United Kingdom,"The church, indeed religion as a whole has reached an impasse.

The Bible is a little vague in terms of who should 'teach' Jesus' followers; but reading it myself leads me to think that it is generally against women as priests/religions teachers.

Did Jesus ever intend for there to be hundreds of expensive buildings with stained glass windows, and for there to be a military/monarchy styled ranking system; and indeed for the idea of a full 'clergy' to exist?  Only God know that.  Perhaps if this is all what he intended the Bible would have had instructions.  Instead we are left with men to interpret the vagaries of the Bible and say how it should be.

Religions should have no special status; perhaps only that of a 'private members club or group.

In equality law, an ‘association’ is any group of 25 or more members which has rules to control how someone becomes a member, involving a genuine selection process.

The law is very clear on this.  There are protected characteristics of age, race, sex etc.  You cannot discriminate on these.

Why do we give religions, even non-established religions special characteristics?

Either we need to accept that there is no such thing as the principle of equality.

Or, we MUST allow for female bishops, right the way up to Archbishop, and MUST allow for female Imams, at every level; and the same throughout every religious club.  They should be measured, treated the same as private clubs, to make sure they make movements toward equality.

There should be provision for gay imams, gay bishops etc. as well.

When people in authority come out and say stuff like this all it does is  put people off from getting the flu jab and some of these people will go on to get the flu and die.

Just because the vaccine doesn't work on everyone doesn't mean we should stop as it is still likely to save many lives.

Dr Osterman who is the author of the report even says that the vaccine should still be taken as is still our best line of defence. The real reason for his report was not to say that people should stop taking the flu jab he is actually trying to highlight that because the flu vaccine in its current form is not as efective as most people believe he want governments and pharmacutical companies to increase their funding and research to make more effective vaccines and medicines for flu. 

However what has happened (and I imagine is not what Dr Osterman intended when this report was published) is that the report has been picked up by newspapers in the States (and now here) questioning the need for a flu vaccine at all and why are we spending all the money on it. 

However that does not change the fact that at the moment the flu vaccine is our best defence and as such should be taken as it will definitely prevent some people from dying.

So really he should have not said anything at all or went about this in a different way (or at least worded his report differently) as because of the way this is now being reported in the press we're going to have people not taking the vaccine and others wanting to stop it altogether.

What we should be doing is still encouraging people to have the jab and also increase funding into flu vaccine research.",0,1353499835,null,0,false,0,c74on0m,t3_13k2wj,t1_c74on0m,t1_c74o7dc,null,1430463824,-9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-9

When Fergie was doing badly (pre-Premiership, so around 23-25 years ago instead of 15) there wasn't that much difference financially between a great season and an average season. Today we look at the financial situation and we're seeing a bottom line difference in the tens of millions of Pounds just for finishing a few points lower than you could/should have

At the end of the day, I don't think RDM was ever going to keep the job on a long-term basis. I said from day one that another manager was waiting in the wings, Pep or Mourinho, and that RDM's 2 year deal was just a small step above being the Interim Manager he was last season. Now we'll be looking at another short term replacement; Rafa Benitez. Here's where the economics of the situation plays out...

RDM was on a 2 year deal at very low wages compared to previous managers, so the payout will be small by our standards. Benitez is unattached and wants to put himself in the shop window, we'll afford him the opportunity in exchange for an experienced head. Benitez is also the man who Torres has never gotten over, the one who nurtured the goalscoring monster. Now if we put our sensible caps on, Mourinho will not leave Real in the middle of the season and I doubt Pep would break his 'promise' of a year long sabbatical, I also highly doubt a move as expensive as Falcao's would transpire in January, so any major staff or player movement will wait until next Summer. Rafa has until that time to extract something out of Torres, while he has that long to redeem anything or merely increase his transfer value. At the end of the season we'll either have a certified failure and cut losses, or a much improved Torres, Rafa will have hopefully shown he can manage at the highest level and I'd expect Mourinho or Pep to come in and take the job

Don't forget, we've invested near enough £100m in Torres and it's much easier to change the manager than it is to give up on such an investment. If we're talking about legacy, neither Pep or Mourinho has stuck around long enough to rebuild a team they themselves assembled so both are unproven in that regard, which many including myself would argue is the ultimate test of a manager. The fact Fergie has successfully done it 4 or 5 times while still winning is a key reason many consider him the best ever

Well I've rambled on a lot. Summation is this, expect Rafa in this week, Falcao + Mourinho/Pep in the Summer.

Yes.

No microbiologist. 

&gt;When people in authority come out and say stuff like this all it does is put people off from getting the flu jab and some of these people will go on to get the flu and die.

So scientists should keep quiet and not advise the government then? 
And you are also talking rubbish, people die of flu every year, often even if they have had the flu jab. If you had read the article properly then you would know that. Aside from which the most vulnerable groups are offered a flu jab as a matter of course rather than just an option. 

&gt;Just because the vaccine doesn't work on everyone doesn't mean we should stop as it is still likely to save many lives.

And the researchers behind the article have said exactly that. 

&gt;Dr Osterman who is the author of the report even says that the vaccine should still be taken as is still our best line of defence. The real reason for his report was not to say that people should stop taking the flu jab he is actually trying to highlight that because the flu vaccine in its current form is not as efective as most people believe he want governments and pharmacutical companies to increase their funding and research to make more effective vaccines and medicines for flu.
However what has happened (and I imagine is not what Dr Osterman intended when this report was published) is that the report has been picked up by newspapers in the States (and now here) questioning the need for a flu vaccine at all and why are we spending all the money on it.

Yeah and that is nearly ALWAYS what happens whenever scientists say anything, you must be aware of the Daily Mail surely? Doesn't mean scientists should 'shut the fuck up' as you so eloquently put it. That is an idiotic view that we should somehow be responsible for what the media does. 

&gt;So really he should have not said anything at all or went about this in a different way (or at least worded his report differently) as because of the way this is now being reported in the press we're going to have people not taking the vaccine and others wanting to stop it altogether.

What a load of crap. Scientists should not word reports to appease the media or anyone else, the report what is there. This was a massive study, and should absolutely be published as it is and how it was written. What the press do is up to them but science should never be altered for the sake of what the media might too. 

It seems to me you didn't read the article properly the first time and are now backtracking by making ludicrous suggestions like the one above.

I want to quickly drop something in on this. 

This is a massive topic, and you can confirm (through respected news outlets) the existence of several paedophiles within the Thatcher government pretty easily (simply by looking at Wikipedia). Jimmy Savile has just given this story steam. I've always wondered when this would come to light.

Redditors believe themselves to be highly intelligent and deductive. I want to propose some statements to you below and see if you can put together the pieces.

If you look at google maps, the Bryn Alyn home in Wrexham is a couple of miles from the quarry owned by McAlpine's construction company. Attached is an airfield that A MAN used to visit Jimmie McAlpine.

A victim of horrific child abuse takes one look at his abuser, then doesn't look again for nearly a decade, then accuses him, and then suddenly realises that it isn't the man? This is contradictory to all psychological understanding of an abuse victim and of any common sense. Qui bono? Who benefits from this mistake? Similarly, read the circumstance surrounding Messham's ""change of opinion"" (he essentially is AWOL for 14 hours before returning distraught to his apartment).

Every single journalist or agitant in relation to these allegations has ended up dead via suicide, misadventure or timely death. The original publication of the story in Scallywag by writer and co-founder Angus James came to an abrupt end after a car crash in Cyprus. Look at the break pedal failure on this car of the North Wales whistle-blowing councillor days after the inquiry was reopened. Look at the deaths in prison of everyone convicted. See the case of Stephen Milligan and Justin Fashanu to see how this sort of thing ends. In addition, I think it's interesting to read this account here before anything at all was known about the paedophile ring. As far as this reporter understands, the older brother Chris is a conspiracy theorist. Recent events make this article pretty chilling. http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-family-destroyed-by-being-in-care-1283995.html

A MAN sold, in 2003 via a reseller, a book containing a lot of erotic photographs, including images of underaged girls posed seductively. It was entitled ""a very private collection"". 

Similarly, this is also the same man that wrote a book on ways to manipulate for your own benefit. He wrote and published the book The New Machiavelli: The Art of Politics in Business. Within it he demonstrates ways to spin the media to your advantage and the way to manipulate a public outcome. He drops such gems as ""McAlpine's advice on dealing with the media? Spread false defeat to gain public sympathy; or false accusation and then arrange for it to be exposed as such - so the accuser will forever be treated with suspicion."" He summarised the work as ‘A book on how to manipulate people for the greater good.'

Look at the sheer weight of testimony and suspicion. Sexual misconduct of a severe nature within the British parliament can be followed from Savile all the way through both Tory and Labour (for instance look at the way the Jersey child abuse scandal implicating a British PM was handled). This is and has been a widespread issue that few really know the end of. 

Lastly, read up on the profile of a paedophile (relationship with children, history with women, history on moving) and then have a look at A MAN's history. Particularly look at the fact that he's donating money to a children protection charity, and then look at Jimmy Savile's own books on stranger danger.

Three final things. 

Child abuse does not leave you psychologically healthy. Sadly, this gets tied into widening (and false claims), including claims of alien abduction, lizard people and so on. While reading about these things and researching them (especially on the public forum of the internet) you're going to have to wade through a lot of shit to see the actual fire in all the smoke. 

Secondly, so often people tell others not to be ""sheeple"". Often you'll see evidence (convenient suicides and death dates) and move on without reconciling it. Let me say that as someone with an elevated perspective on this, it is a SHAME that this would end like this. I would also point out to those skeptical that a coverup of this situation is beneficial to every party involved. Both Tory and Labour politicians have been named, as well as members of the police force. It is important to remember that everybody has been talking for years about this ""Mr A"", but he has never been charged, despite the fact that the other named suspects in the case were charged in 1991. 

Thirdly and finally, it's hard for me to expound this out fully due to recent developments. I would just ask, that whether you believe him innocent or not, please keep reading every single thing you're able to find on him. Either many, many, many people are collectively deluded about the same thing, or there is truth to these claims. I cannot begin to explain how sure both the Bureau and Newsnight have to be to go near this type of story, or to publish it. The idea that teams of professional journalists would all fail to verify this is laughable. As far as I can see, the most dangerous factors at the moment for this story continuing is the fact that THE SUSPECT would mostly implicate many past respected conservatives and labour MP's and even PM's. It would damage the British establishment no end.
There is also a question of wealth and the effective silencing of all previous whistleblowers. This is a group that is able to revoke the entry visa of a journalist who has come to the UK to research child abuse cover ups. See ""Leah McGrath Goodman"".

Post-script: it's late, but this post is one of the most comprehensive and clean lists of the entire affair. Of particular note in this case are the notes on Scallywag. Something that is not listed there is that the 2000 death of Regan ""after brief illness"" at the age of 58 coincides with the Waterhouse inquiry into THE MAN.

http://neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=44387660&amp;postcount=923

I think the thing that is so terrible is that nearly every line of inquiry ends in death. Terrible, ignominious deaths. Whether it's somebody related to the inquiry, or the victims themselves, it just all ends in a single line in the paper.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;...Is the jobcentre going all 1984 on us?

The introduction of Universal Jobmatch is part of the evolution of ""signing-on"" and how the DWP expect claimants to both look for work, and manage their claim.

By the end of this parliament / start of the next one, the vast majority of claimants should have transferred over to Universal Credit. Essentially claimants will receive one lump sum each month, comprised of all their existing benefits - so for instance, JSA + LHA. The process will be managed online, and claimants will be expected to manage their finances, much the same way those of us who work do, when we get paid.

On paper, it's a good idea. In reality it'll trigger a fuck-tonne of problems. Especially if there are over payments. I had someone yesterday who was paid too much housing benefit [this under the current scheme, not Universal Credit] who fortunately realised she'd been overpaid, and so made a point not to spend it, knowing full well it would be claimed back down the road.

The second reason for the introduction of Universal jobmatch, is to facilitate the new JSA conditions claimants will be expected to adhere to, starting next year. From next year Claimants will be expected to jobsearch for 35 hours per week. Universal Jobmatch will be pushed by DWP staff as a means to allow claimants to show they're ""actively"" searching for work, for 35 hours per week.

I've only had a very, *very* brief look at Universal Jobmatch, though  I know we're looking into it more closely, so that we can advise the people we work with, so they don't suddenly find themselves being sanctioned by the JCP.",0,1353502808,null,0,false,0,c74oyre,t3_13k6gs,t1_c74oyre,t3_13k6gs,null,1430463977,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

In reality, Islam faces the same if not worse problems than Christianity; in that most of the leadership and the laity would be against equal position of men and women.
The argument that both religions use is usually 'Men and women are just as important as each other, but they have different roles in our faith, different tasks are appointed to them, but that doesn't make them any less equal.

Yes, and the problem is everyone thinks this way.  Oh, **my** carbon output makes no difference individually.  You are entertaining the tragedy of the commons fallacy.

Britain is in a very capable position of leading the way in alternative energy, we're far wealthier than developing countries and have the scientific and technological capability to develop alternatives.  These could then be taken up by those other countries, which lack the means to develop them.

It's idiotic to be so shortsighted on a problem which affects the entire world.  The oceans won't give a fuck that Britain cleaned up its act right at the end.  It should be a collaborative effort, which is more effective.  Maybe British efforts produce a break through, we'll never know if we don't bother.

That however is besides the point. The fact is that because of the way this report is being reported in the press some people who may have got the flu jab might not now. And as a result some people might die. 

My uncle died of flu three years ago and he was only 63. He never got the flu jab. Getting the flu jab might not have stopped him getting the flu jab but it may have done. I know for a fact though that he was exactly the sort of person who after reading an article like this would have decided that he would never bother getting a flu jab again. 

So simply because of the idiocy of the general public and because of the way that some lazy sensationlist journalists will report things scientists should be careful how they word reports or make public statements.

To us it's silly nonsense which isn't a priority. To them, it's a necessity. One big thing is that within that tiny house a TV is probably completely necessary to avoid going insane. People need things to remain in a decent mental state. I'd argue that some sort of entertainment system comes under such ""things"".

Secondly, the kids thing. I totally agree that they have two kids too many. But we don't know the circumstances of their conception. And that really brings me to the main point. We don't the know if their possessions (kids, TV) were bought at a period in their lives before they ended up in this house, before they were hard up.

So they can hold onto them, sending them back in time again if ever they attempted to leave.

&gt; why have lights in the hotel when the angels work best in darkness didnt they build the hotel?

They still have to lure people in; if there is light then they will proceed further into the hotel before realising they're trapped.

&gt; you cant send them back in time forever, unless that hotel has existed since the dawn of time like old rusty.

See above.

&gt; the mafia boss guy is a complete idiot, he is terrified of the angels so what does he do? lock one up and torture it, thats a good idea.

Fear makes people do irrational things, and it's not like he's supposed to be really clever in the first place.

&gt; the doctor is stupid in this episode too

He's emotional; once he reads the title of the last chapter his emotions get the better of him, and we know what effect that has.

&gt; the moment he sees rory dead hes like ""thats it i give up sorry rory, fixed time and all that"" in fact moffat seems to be making up the rules of timetravel as he foes along in this one, the time can be rewritted concept flys out the window.

Not all time can be changed, and being witness to the course of events is one way that a particular personal timeline stays fixed. This is actually consistent with older stories too. It's the same reason why if something bad happens you can't just go backwards and try again.

&gt; and amy and rorys departure could have easily been avoided if they travelled outside of new york to be picked up in the TARDIS, hell they coud even wait a few years to see him again, its not like the doctor cant return to the fifties or something.

Except that the moment they were sent back, their time and place of death became fixed and the risk of altering that in any way is too great to try.

&gt; and the statue of liberty becoming an angel is never explained, nor is it possible that it could move at all since there would be so many on lookers preventing it from moving. and thats why it sucks

The Angels had enough power to project into the forms of ordinary statues (which is why there were other Angels that didn't look like Angels; they took over the other statues in New York, including the Statue of Liberty), and as they had clearly been there for a long time, it stands to reason that even in 1930s New York, with fewer people in general, a lot of the population had been previously taken by the Angels into Winter Quay, and so there were not as many on the streets as previously, particularly at night time.

UK society is so secular now that we don't understand and/or care about the theological arguments, and that from an outside perspective it looks discriminatory and seemingly non-sensical to have a woman at the top and then technically subordinate positions can't have women in them. 

However, if you look at it historically/theologically, it's not remotely problematic and is a resolution to the historical problem of whether spiritual or secular power were ultimately superior in this world (see stuff like the [Investiture Controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_Controversy) for instance) and this is quite a distinct issue from investing people with clerical office. So there's an important distinction about Elizabeth being head of the Church because secular authority overrides spiritual authority according to the Church of England, and having spiritual authority because of holding that office. She doesn't. That's why she's above the clergy in the Church.

See, from my experience, this is precisely what's most targeted. There's almost constantly a campaign against child traffic accidents and suicide. In more recent years there's been almost constant adverts on television regarding reporting suspected child abuse too, this mainly focusing on physical violence though. Violent abuse probably coincides with sexual abuse in many cases though and is a little easier to constantly advertise and warn about without the general public taking issue with sexual assault being constantly in their faces.

How were you being a cheeky bastard?
You didn't manage to read the article then?
and
It seems to me you didn't read the article properly the first time and are now backtracking by making ludicrous suggestions like the one above.
Are examples of you being a cheeky bastard. I'm a bloke in my forties and if anyone is cheeky to me I'll fucking tell them you so.

Big woop....I am a woman in her 30's... your point is what? I can't say I am that fussed whether you think I am being cheeky or not. if anything, I was being direct and suggesting you hadn't read it, which by the rest of your previous comment and the rest of this one, it is clear you hadn't. 

&gt;That however is besides the point. 

So beside the point you spend several lines pointing it out. 

&gt;The fact is that because of the way this report is being reported in the press some people who may have got the flu jab might not now. And as a result some people might die.

So take it up with the media, the papers, take it up with how they report it. Also saying something *may* happen does not make it certain it will happen. If I was going to rip it apart, I could accuse you of having no basis for your claims whatsoever, but seriously it isn't worth my or your time. 

&gt;My uncle died of flu three years ago and he was only 63. He never got the flu jab. Getting the flu jab might not have stopped him getting the flu jab but it may have done. I know for a fact though that he was exactly the sort of person who after reading an article like this would have decided that he would never bother getting a flu jab again.

And being of that age he would have been offered the flu jab as a matter of course ( or should have been at over 60), if he doesn't take it, that is his choice. Lazy journalism helps no one, but you cannot restrict what scientists say simply because media are lazy and people believe the media.  To be fair to the original article, it does stress that people should still have the flu jab, and makes it clear what the original paper was all about, which is more than what most media articles do. 

&gt;So simply because of the idiocy of the general public and because of the way that some lazy sensationlist journalists will report things scientists should be careful how they word reports or make public statements.

No, we should never compromise what we say in published articles, if we do it doesn't further science or help anyone. There is no way anyone should be held to account for what the media prints, aside from the media themselves. 

&gt;You only have to look at the MMR vaccine link to autism study (or read the Daily Express) to see what can happen when a report is picked up by the press

Yes and Wakefield was a fraud, he engineered that release on purpose because he was getting paid to. The media ran with it and scared the crap out of parents, had they bothered checking their sources then it would not have happened, but since when did the media ever do that?

Dude, that's like a grand's worth of stuff. And ""leather sofa"" it looked like some MDF piece of crap, you can get these for about £100 at the cattle market in Nottingham.

While he's proven his worth at disrupting scuffles, he's not part of the build-up on offense. The lack of veteran players (I'm looking at you, Mikel) stepping up to ""control"" the game is cramping us right now.

* The ""false 9"" I've seen referenced here could have worked, if we had more time to perfect it. The lack of an outright striker hurts, but we have brilliant tacticians in Mata and Oscar. The problem I saw the most yesterday was that Mata or Oscar would control the ball but had no one to pass to. If Mata had the ball, no one made runs inside. If Oscar had the ball, Mata was lingering behind in midfield in case of a Juventus break. We played overly defensive last night, but still didn't stop the pain train.

* We have no one running flanks. I'm not entirely sure what Azpilicueta's job was last night, but I only ever saw him directly in front of Ivanovic, basically planted on the touchline. Why would Ivanovic pass to a guy who's being marked like a hawk, who's planted firmly on the touchline, with no one ahead to make passes? I don't get it.

* The first two goals scored were very unfortunate. I think our strategy was ""play defensively, but look for breaks"". Unfortunately, our defense is our Achilles heel of late. I didn't think that was going to work at all. It was nice to have Ashley Cole back, but I was unimpressed with his offensive involvement. He usually can make flank runs but our formation mostly prevented him from doing that.

This is a massive topic, and you can confirm (through respected news outlets) the existence of several paedophiles within the Thatcher government pretty easily (simply by looking at Wikipedia). Jimmy Savile has just given this story steam. I've always wondered when this would come to light.

Redditors believe themselves to be highly intelligent and deductive. I want to propose some statements to you below and see if you can put together the pieces.
If you look at google maps, the Bryn Alyn home in Wrexham is a couple of miles from the quarry owned by McAlpine's construction company. Attached is an airfield that A MAN used to visit Jimmie McAlpine.

A victim of horrific child abuse takes one look at his abuser, then doesn't look again for nearly a decade, then accuses him, and then suddenly realises that it isn't the man? This is contradictory to all psychological understanding of an abuse victim and of any common sense. Qui bono? Who benefits from this mistake? Similarly, read the circumstance surrounding Messham's ""change of opinion"" (he essentially is AWOL for 14 hours before returning distraught to his apartment).

Every single journalist or agitant in relation to these allegations has ended up dead via suicide, misadventure or timely death. The original publication of the story in Scallywag by writer and co-founder Angus James came to an abrupt end after a car crash in Cyprus. The pedal failure in the article is a good example. Look at the deaths in prison of everyone convicted. See the case of Stephen Milligan and Justin Fashanu to see how this sort of thing ends. In addition, I think it's interesting to read this account here before anything at all was known about the paedophile ring. As far as this reporter understands, the older brother Chris is a conspiracy theorist. Recent events make this article pretty chilling. http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-family-destroyed-by-being-in-care-1283995.html

A MAN sold, in 2003 via a reseller, a book containing a lot of erotic photographs, including images of underaged girls posed seductively. It was entitled ""a very private collection"".

Similarly, this is also the same man that wrote a book on ways to manipulate for your own benefit. He wrote and published the book The New Machiavelli: The Art of Politics in Business. Within it he demonstrates ways to spin the media to your advantage and the way to manipulate a public outcome. He drops such gems as ""McAlpine's advice on dealing with the media? Spread false defeat to gain public sympathy; or false accusation and then arrange for it to be exposed as such - so the accuser will forever be treated with suspicion."" He summarised the work as ‘A book on how to manipulate people for the greater good.'

Look at the sheer weight of testimony and suspicion. Sexual misconduct of a severe nature within the British parliament can be followed from Savile all the way through both Tory and Labour (for instance look at the way the Jersey child abuse scandal implicating a British PM was handled). This is and has been a widespread issue that few really know the end of.

Lastly, read up on the profile of a paedophile (relationship with children, history with women, history on moving) and then have a look at A MAN's history. Particularly look at the fact that he's donating money to a children protection charity, and then look at Jimmy Savile's own books on stranger danger.
Three final things.

Child abuse does not leave you psychologically healthy. Sadly, this gets tied into widening (and false claims), including claims of alien abduction, lizard people and so on. While reading about these things and researching them (especially on the public forum of the internet) you're going to have to wade through a lot of shit to see the actual fire in all the smoke.

Secondly, so often people tell others not to be ""sheeple"". Often you'll see evidence (convenient suicides and death dates) and move on without reconciling it. Let me say that as someone with an elevated perspective on this, it is a SHAME that this would end like this. I would also point out to those skeptical that a coverup of this situation is beneficial to every party involved. Both Tory and Labour politicians have been named, as well as members of the police force. It is important to remember that everybody has been talking for years about this ""Mr A"", but he has never been charged, despite the fact that the other named suspects in the case were charged in 1991.

Thirdly and finally, it's hard for me to expound this out fully due to recent developments. I would just ask, that whether you believe him innocent or not, please keep reading every single thing you're able to find on him. Either many, many, many people are collectively deluded about the same thing, or there is truth to these claims. I cannot begin to explain how sure both the Bureau and Newsnight have to be to go near this type of story, or to publish it. The idea that teams of professional journalists would all fail to verify this is laughable. As far as I can see, the most dangerous factors at the moment for this story continuing is the fact that THE SUSPECT would mostly implicate many past respected conservatives and labour MP's and even PM's. It would damage the British establishment no end. There is also a question of wealth and the effective silencing of all previous whistleblowers. This is a group that is able to revoke the entry visa of a journalist who has come to the UK to research child abuse cover ups. See ""Leah McGrath Goodman"".

Post-script: it's late, but this post is one of the most comprehensive and clean lists of the entire affair. Of particular note in this case are the notes on Scallywag. Something that is not listed there is that the 2000 death of Regan ""after brief illness"" at the age of 58 coincides with the Waterhouse inquiry into THE MAN.

&gt;Let's be realistic, our team is not as good as everyone thinks. Fact. 
 
&gt;Most chelsea fans believe getting a new striker will fix things - it will not.

&gt;Chelsea look poor in defence. Everyone was quick to jump on Torres's back and call for his head, do we do the same with Luiz? As much as scoring goals is the bench mark for a striker, so are clean sheets for defenders. Now, I actually believe we should continue with Luiz because I do think he could become easily one of the best CB's in the world. 

&gt;Our build up from defence to attack is often poor. Unless it is a counter attack we look really sluggish and can't play against any team who defend with a deep line. If you watched us against Tottenham we had good opportunities because they play a high line, and they had Gallas in their team.

&gt;Our attacking trio, as good as they can be, have not gelled. They have shown glimpses, but it's not working at the moment. We don't retain enough possession of the ball to relieve our defenders, and to tire the enemy defenders. 

&gt;Does anyone expect to win games when the defense is not working or is making mistakes, the midfield still looks disconnected (and is not producing much) and we have out of form strikers? However, these may or not be RDM's fault.

&gt;Also, RDM didn't exactly tactically impress with his CL win. Yes, I am forever grateful, but he did get sacked from West Brom. You could kind of tell he probably only got the job because he won the CL, but let's remember that fool Avram Grant was one penalty away from doing the same. 

&gt;Now, I don't think he deserved the sack, because it will probably hurt us this season, but if any season is to go badly it is this season. Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Mikel, Luiz, Ramires, Cahil and Azpi will only get better, and the future is bright.

If we could get up to 8th place we end up being in pot 1 and then its easy street from there on (haha joking no games in Europe are easy!)

Only by competing in either the Chumps league or the Euro Disney league can we get the coefficient up and thus end up being top seeds and getting a better draw.

I personally hope we either progress from this group (not much chance) or go on a great run in the Europa league, we need the coefficient points and fast!

With regards to the restaurant, It was more of a design and advertising scenario. Their website was outdated and buggy, so I gave them a few pointers and found the lad who was building it a short crash course in CSS and HTML and the like. They desperately needed a wider customer base, so I registered them on TripAdvisor:- http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186394-d1828736-Reviews-Jack_sprats-Newcastle_upon_Tyne_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html

I designed a few flyers and posters for them to distribute around their area and Newcastle Town Centre.
They also had this old burger van, which was sitting around doing nothing. I got some paint and whatnot and spruced it up a little, and they are planning to make it's début appearance at the next ""Green festival"" which is just the right atmosphere for them. They still keep to their morals and ethical standpoint, and yet they seem to be flourishing. It is quite a niche market that they have, but with a little hard work and loving they really could start a few chain restaurants, all based on their way of life. 


The construction firm was slightly different, and it's not easy to explain the differences through text. They already had a fairly decent profit margin, but the lad running it wanted to give his closest staff a pay rise, since they'd been working to pull the firm up out of the ashes for almost six years. I had recently been reading up on a process that Nissan use, namely ""Kaizen"", literally meaning ""continuous improvement"". Having just acquired a new contract, they had a build finish date of March 2012. This gave them eight months to build a large private home in Northumberland. 
To begin with, I outlined every stage of the process before work commenced, allocating build time and work load. Part of the Kaizen process is equalising the amount of work undertaken by any individual, in this case a bit more roughly. Also, as a rule, Kaizen usually goes hand in hand with ""5S"" or ""5C"" as some know it. 
I outlined the construction site, and where vans could be parked. On the basis that many tools would remain in the van until used, they were parked in a crescent shape around two sides of the project, with rear doors facng the workers. In between the vans, various tool boxes and supplies were organised for easy access, with a tarp covering water sensitive ones. The foundations were already laid, so the builders began on brickwork. Before work commenced, I used tape to outline where bricks were to be laid. A team of eight began specific rows of bricks, and such was the result that the work was finished in one day, bar a two hour inspection and slight modification the following day.
Work continued much in this fashion, with clear tasks and breaks outlined. The only hitch that we experienced was with pipework, as extra materials had to be brought out to compensate for a very high water pressure rating. 
The house was actually completed in late January, almost two months ahead of schedule. Since then, the owner has implemented Kaizen and 5S in most of his later contracts and has seen a much higher satisfaction rate. He has also seen a great increase in customers. His profit is slowly on the rise, but in an economy like today's, even breaking even is better than expected, especially around the North-East.

To be brutally honest, I'm not a miracle worker. I just have a different way of looking at things, and I think anything can be adapted to almost anything else. Once I have done a few more projects I'll start putting together a detailed portfolio explaining how I do it, but right now I need more examples. Slowly but surely, I'm readying a leaflet of references and testimonials too, which will help matters. Right now, those are the only two projects where I have been in charge of the change process. Most of the other situations I've been in, I've been either a member of staff or a close friend, and have mentioned something that has been taken on and implememnted without my input. In essence, this was a voluntary assignment at first, but now, seeing as I'm finding it difficult to find a job, it's a potential income with a great moral benefit.

Even the decision makers were lenient. 

However the policy now is extremely harsh: If you show up even 5 minutes late, they cancel the appointment and make you come in again on another day at your own expense, as well as sending a late report off for a possible sanction decision. They will not remind you of interviews and often will not even give you paperwork when they arrange it. They never have any job recommendations any more either, they just note what I've done and release the payment. As I found out recently too, they will 'nil rate' your claim without telling you, meaning they stop all further payments until you fill out a form, which they will not offer you at sign on even if they know the status of the claim.

So this card holder is designed to be simple, your cards wont fall out when you remove one, because your right that would be a stupid design. In fact, even with only one card inside the holder it wont fall out! 

Not every one will find this product useful as some people still like to cart loads of change around and that's fine.

The wallet is designed so that you can easily remove the card you want, even in a wallet you would need to know which pocket your card is in and unless you have clear pouches only the top of your card is visible anyway, so lack of visibility in this holder is not an issue!

Due to the materials this product is made from its extremely hard wearing, there are no plastic pockets that will rip or need replacing.

&gt;The United Kingdom National DNA Database (NDNAD; officially the UK National Criminal Intelligence DNA Database) is a national DNA Database that was set up in 1995. As of the end of 2005, it carried the profiles of around 3.1 million people. In March 2012 the database contained an estimated 5,950,612 individuals. The database, which grows by 30,000 samples each month, is populated by samples recovered from crime scenes and taken from police suspects[1] and, in England and Wales, anyone arrested and detained at a police station.


&gt;Only patterns of short tandem repeats are stored in the NDNAD – not a person's full genomic sequence. Currently the ten loci of the SGM+ system are analysed, resulting in a string of 20 numbers, being two allele repeats from each of the ten loci. Amelogenin is used for a rapid test of a donor's sex.


&gt;However, individuals' skin or blood samples are also kept permanently linked to the database and can contain complete genetic information. Because DNA is inherited, the database can also be used to indirectly identify many others in the population related to a database subject. Stored samples can also degrade and become useless, particularly those taken with dry brushes and swabs.
The UK NDNAD is run by the Home Office, after transferring from the custodianship of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) on 1 October 2012.

But it is true, Torres' form has created major problems for all managers that have had him at Chelsea.

Universal Jobmatch, so I'm led to believe, is currently ""opt-in"". As in it's being suggested by JCP staff as a resource that can be utilised to help claimants look for work. So ""*Yep, continue to use Indeed, and other recruitment sites, in addition to phoning and cold-calling, but you should also register for our new service.*""

Eventually claimants will be mandated to use it, under two different guises:

* Internet skills are vital in todays' world. Using Universal Jobmatch is an excellent way to develop your I.T. skills, whilst also looking for work.
* Univeral Jobmatch includes some ""useful"" tools, including the ability for the DWP / JCP to see what you're searching for. If you turn up to sign-on and you've forgotten your written log? Don't worry, we can see from the system what you've been doing. In fact - why keep a written log at all? Just use our service which'll track what you're doing.

&gt;..The Schoolbooks were the snitchiest technology of them all, logging every keystroke, watching all the network traffic for suspicious keywords, counting every click, keeping track of every fleeting thought you put out over the 'net...

Obviously Doctorow is writing fiction - it's not like the Government would have the ability to run automated scripts that access a claimants Government Gateway account and check to see how they've been using the system - i.e. seeing how often a person logs in, what they do once logged in, how many jobs they apply for, checking see if that job meets the keywords that are scanned via say uploading a CV...",0,1353517246,null,0,false,0,c74rznj,t3_13k6gs,t1_c74rznj,t1_c74rnji,null,1430465402,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Arsenal have won more trophies during their existence than we have, Champions League/European Cup being the only thing we can boast about.

They also fill up a 60,000 stadium with higher ticket prices than us while having the same percentage of seats filled as us, so the argument that we'd sell out a bigger stadium if we had it doesn't fly

Prestige is a debatable and intangible metric, but Arsenal is a far more popular club worldwide than we are, have had a higher revenue every year with the exception of last year where we overtook them thanks to the CL victory and as a corporate entity are far more valuable than we are. If despite all those facts you somehow think Chelsea are the bigger club, then you're simply biased. Right now we might be a more attractive club to play for, but that's all. If it hadn't have been for Liverpools stunning fall from grace over the past few years, they'd be ahead of us too. Arsenal were successful long before us, the fans they attracted during that time are an economically viable market right now, we won't see our fanbase be of a comparable size until we've been winning for a while and people have grown up with us being at the forefront of English/European football

Do you mean in general or do you mean available managers?

Rafa is a great tactician but he's just about in the same league as a handful of other managers in that regard. He's certainly a step up from RDM, but to diminish Pep's accomplishments and to say ""he has no plan B"" is silly. 

&gt;Liverpool the Champions League and host of other trophies.

1 FA cup and 1 League Cup. 0 Premier leagues. So in 6 seasons at Liverpool he won 1 League Cup more than RDM managed in &lt; 1 yr

&gt;people only started hearing about him after his short spell at Inter or his last few months at Liverpool

No some some of us also remember Rafa's style of management. Far colder and more alienating than even AVB was. 

It's not like his last season at Liverpool or his half at season at Inter should just be ignored.

Religions have always changed with society, and in fact it's quite a good way to persuade people: tell someone to do 10 good deeds a day and they'll laugh, but tell them to do one a day and they'll say 'eh, that's not too hard'. Once they do one a day, you can say 'See, you can do it. Now try doing two.' (Maybe not the best explanation, but I'm making this up as I go along)

You can actually take examples of this change with society from the Bible itself. For example, the famous quote 'an eye for an eye'. While often used as an example of 'barbarism', it was actually very fair for its day, LIMITING people to taking an equal compensation for a crime. Then in the New Testament, Jesus gives the also famous quote 'turn the other cheek'. This wasn't contradicting the Old Testament, it was saying 'Hey guys, we've been fair so far, but we can be even better than that.'

Additionally, a lot of 'change' in religions is more reinterpreting God's wishes for a changing society. The Bible isn't meant to be read as absolute orders about WHAT to do (otherwise it would be given in a series of lists and bulletpoints), but as a guide to HOW to live a good life. However, it was written two millenia ago, and with all the social change of the last century it needs to be reinterpreted more and more often.

Obviously, in the case of women bishops, the Church is definitely behind the times officially, but as the vote shows the vast majority of its members do believe that it's fine to have them in the Church. And in all honesty, in real terms we still aren't that much further ahead with equality for women in top jobs. As an example, yes, women CAN become company CEOs, but what percentage of them actually ARE female? Far less than 50%.

-----------------------------

honestly, i feel like di matteo is a redknapp type of manager. all about inspiration but a tactical pygmy (if anyone gets the reference). he went with 5 at the back which i wouldn't have minded if this made mikel/ramires push further into the midfield and put pressure on pirlo. the only time people seem to have joy against juve, or even italy this summer for that matter, was when pirlo wasn't given the time on the ball to provide those delic passes to vidal and marchisio. you would think instead of trying this out in a must win CL match, he might try flooding the midfield to clog it up, maybe with a reciprocating 433.
to be fair, it doesn't seem like RDM looks comfortable outside his 4231 and i don't think its a format that suits what these players should be doing. frankly a 433 with mikel deep and ramires and oscar providing passes and runs with wingers mata/hazard would suit a counterattacking style way better, and that is when we've caused the most damage this season, on the counter. our wingers don't track back out of laziness or exhaustion, it doesn't matter, they still don't. so if thats the case, which you can see in the past few games, then put 3 in the middle to provide protection as well as outlets. frankly torres not playing tonight, or anyone that can head the ball for that matter, caused the loss of possession alot, and in the second half specifically, never really looked like scoring. i think not having someone to run directly at their back line proved to be a huge sticking point, as when oscar/hazard/mata got near the box the just kept passing it around with no one really looking like they'd take charge to play that hitman role, other than the odd speculative shot.
this current slump isn't down to our apparent lack of a striker, but more to do with how we set up, how rigid our formation is, and everyones apparent uncertainty in it. i'd like di matteo to stay the year, but he needs to do some homework or we're going to keep getting picked apart by anyone with a decent team. i fear going to goodison.",0,1353524070,null,0,false,0,c74tx24,t3_13k4ma,t1_c74tx24,t3_13k4ma,null,1430466327,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Mourinho:

- We lost the best manager in the game due to pure boneheadedness and stubbornness

Ancelotti: 

- The Fernando Torres transfer
- The sacking of Ray Wilkins

AVB:

- Manager hired with explicit instructions on how they wanted him to change the team. Ultimately backfired, partly due to hiring an inexperienced manager and also coupled with the fact that they never intended on bringing in players that suited his system.

RDM:

- Refused to buy a striker to protect the Torres investment
- Brought in only young players, offloaded a number of experienced ones but expected results of an experienced squad
- Offloaded all of our central midfield depth without replacing

You must be 60 or 65 depending on your country within the UK, hardly an argument for people in the 50s, who generally find it difficult to find a job.

&gt; automatic access to benefits

What? Sorry! Eh! This isn't the fault of 50 something's, this is a direct attack against youngsters by the Tories, point your finger at them.

&gt; preferential medical treatment

Well I don't know where this comes from, but by all means I think people of the older generation probably need more prompt care compared to a younger and fitter person. Anyway, if your genuinely ill, you will get equally as help as anyone depending on the circumstances. Unless you can provide direct evidence that youngsters are discriminated against by the NHS.

&gt; subsidised care

Sorry what? If your young and disabled or incapable, you're still given access and resources no matter your age.

&gt; housing and fuel

Pensioner age only. Not older adults. Pretty much the same as free bus passes

I don't see how any of your arguments actually contribute towards an argument that older people are not discriminated against. 

This may be true that 18-24 year olds are the larger group, but this certainly is not the fault of 50 somethings looking for work. You're talking about very political problems which are generally the fault of Government failures. 

Also, if you want to look on a possible cause of younger people getting less jobs and one of the reasons this is becoming a bigger problem, just ask the government why they're increasing the retirement age when more jobs are required, less people will retire sooner, meaning less jobs for the rest of us.

true,arroganthipster,null,null,"I'm sorry, guys, but you all have no idea what you're talking about. Rafa Benitez is an extremely accomplished manager with an amazing track record. Have you ever read his blog? The man knows what he's talking about. Liverpool's demise was due more to ownership than his managerial abilities, and, in fact, it was under him that the current batch of Liverpool youngsters (who are quite good, if you ask me) were brought to the club.

As much as the supporters love RDM, let's be realistic - he did not have the tactical know-how to manage a club at the highest level. The games against Atletico Madrid &amp; Juventus highlighted this fact, but even in games against 'lowly' Swansea &amp; West Brom, we were completely outplayed. You might not remember this, but he was actually sacked from West Brom. The man is a good motivator, but you can only get so far with a group of motivated players.

It's clear that the supporters have little to no say in how the club is run, so the best thing to do is remain unified and support the players and the current manager. I believe that Rafa Benitez will bring some stability to the club (much in the way that Carlo Ancelotti did), and, should we finish the season strongly, needs to be given a period of several years during which he has almost complete control of the squad (including loans, squad additions, etc.).

Here's a quote from Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague on the BBC live text:
&gt; ""The profile that Rafael Benitez has got in England is very strange. How quickly people have forgotten that he took Liverpool to two Champions League finals and that he won the Spanish league with Valencia, a league that has got Barcelona and Real Madrid. He also won the Uefa Cup with Valencia. Now he is laughed at, as some sort of fat waiter.

I am so glad he has been given a chance at the level that he wanted.""",0,1353528010,null,0,false,0,c74v0n7,t3_13kxcl,t1_c74v0n7,t3_13kxcl,null,1430466830,42,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,42

You also can't go wrong with a doctor who poster, they have several on thinkgeek or you can just ssearch on amazon. The exploding TARDIS Vincent Van Gough poster is always a good bet. If she drinks coffee or tea go with a TARDIS mug.

If you want to give her an awesome gift, set a date to watch the series with her and get into it yourself :)

Problem is that 42 of the 44 Diocesan Synods support women bishops, but the people theyve elected are people who have more of a reason to want the power to vote than the rest, as far as I know its not a paid job and it comes with a workload, so unless you feel verys trongly about wanting women bishops, in general most people who run for that election are those with special interests in preserving certain ideas, and one of those ideas is to vote against women bishops. I guarantee that come the next elections people on the Diocesan Synods will vote for whoever speaks up for women bishops most, but right now the General Synod is highly misrepresenting their electors.

This is a blow to the church, but its not indicative of a major problem, in five years time it will most likely go through. Considering only 30 years ago you didnt even get women vicars the church is actually moving quite quickly.

But Benitez seems a capable man, and it's too bad we don't get a say in these kind of matters. But realistically speaking, somebody has to do it before one of the other big coaches is ready in the summer, hopefully accompanied by falcao/cavani.

For me, this summer has been the biggest change since I've started supporting them in '05, and I prepared myself for a season of rebuilding the team and adjusting to a new system. It's sad to see some fans consider it a task to support CFC after what happened today. 
Last season, winning CL &amp; FA, was one of the best things I could have hoped for after the whole AVB-saga.

Chelsea is and will be one of the best teams in the world. The least we can do is give our support and be understanding, even if we do not agree with the decisions made.

true,widgetas,null,null,"The CoE is the state sanctioned religion. 26 (male) Bishops get to sit in the Lords as a matter of course - whoever is next in line gets to sit and have a say in the laws of the land by the simple expedient that they landed the right job in the church. The UK is, iirc, the only country in the world other than Iran that allows the clergy to hold positions in government as standard.

Church attendance has been dropping for decades. The CoE used to measure average Sunday attendance, then average weekly. Now they measure average monthly attendance, and highlight 'how many' people go along at Easter &amp; Christmas - This is because the numbers look even worse when they break them down to Sunday/weekly etc. Aside: many, many more people attend football matches than go to church.      
However, public ceremonies are generally conducted by a minister and/or in a religious setting, even though it is more than likely that many if not the majority of people there are not religious: roughly 50% of the population of the UK does not believe in a god/any particular god/adhere to any particular religion. In any case, it is also likely that people of different faiths will be attending.

At present English &amp; Welsh children are the only children in the world, I believe, that are required by law to attend daily acts of worship of a primarily Christian nature. 1/3 of state funded schools in the UK are 'faith' schools, with the majority being run by Christians. While it is argued that these schools are 'better' than the others, the reasons for this are not simply (or at all actually) due to the fact that they teach kids a certain religion (note: religious instruction is not the same as religious education). These schools can also discriminate against non-religious teachers (see next point).

The CoE, along with a number of other religious groups, are exempt from equality legislation - essentially they are able to discriminate based on various things: mainly sex and sexuality, these days. This has been challenged in government in recent years, and it has been defeated. The Bishops voted against closing loop holes for faith schools not so long ago.

The traditional position of the CoE is no longer justified (if it ever really was) and to allow it to continue is unfair and unjust. While it is assumed that the British public are CoE by default, the lack of religious adherence &amp; the general apathy towards religion makes it rather obvious that the CoE doesn't have a leg to stand on when it comes making claims concerning its importance. If we argue down an 'inclusive' route - Is it fair that, given the UK population follows a number of different religions (as well as ~50% not following one at all), that one religion gets so much power &amp; influence?

I can link you to citations if you'd like them. It'll take me a while so I've left them for now.

One would hope that commercial database isn't connected to Monster, given they're the company who built Universal Jobmatch, and who're paid to continue to develop and run the system.

Just think of the Daily Mail reaction to that - a private company, winning a Government contract, and then using said contract to push their own existing commercial business.

I think Luiz will go to the bench to start but work his way back into the starting IX before the year is over. Iva will be used to cover CB instead of RB in most cases. 

Our defensive midfield really wont change since Mikel is on good form. He may do some experimenation with Lamps, Rami, and Romeu next to him but I think it will be Rami and Mikel. 

Our three attacking midfielders should stay as such. Maybe a few tweaks here and there. And BY GOD RAFA PLEASE PLAY MARIN WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER. If this coaching change helps anyone it is going to be Marin.
