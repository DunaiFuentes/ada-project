Vincent and the Doctor, The Girl Who Waited, Dalek, Girl in the Fireplace.... Turn Left made me tear up too.

Classic Who? Genesis of the Daleks, Face of Evil, Vengeance on Various, Battlefield, Remembrance/Resurrection/Revelation of the Daleks. The Aztecs/Romans. Mind Robber. Caves of Androzani.

Audio dramas? A Death in the Family, Project: Destiny, Scherzo, Natural History of Fear, Davros, Omega, Master, He Jests at Scars, Full Fathom Five, *I, Davros* series, Jubilee, Doctor Who and the Pirates, Medicinal Purposes, part 3 of Circular Time, the Charley departure trilogy, Angel of Scutari, Klein trilogy.

A few of those listed are definitely ones for tears, and the other half are mindblowing/emotionally overwhelming.  A Death in the Family is all three seeing as it ties into three arcs, one of which spans over 10 years (real life), is about stories within stories about stories, words, multiple Doctors, companions, death, and the consequences of traveling with the Doctor.

Obviously her family spotted the guy and asked for a picture and autograph. But, he is letching all over her in the picture and she was barely 14.

After I saw that, I always spoke about it to my close friends and family and made them well aware of his creepiness.

I guess, whenever you saw that kinda behaviour from Savile on TV there was always something in the back of your mind telling you that the scene was staged and the girls were paid to stand there and grin while he had his arms all over them.

true,Tidus5005,null,null,"I agree that Hershey's plain milk chocolate bar isn't too great but some of their other products beat anything I can find here in the UK.

We have imported sweets store called 'Cyber Candy' in the UK. It isn't cheap but it's a nice treat now and again. I'm sick of British chocolate. The prices keep rising and the chocolate bars are getting smaller. Infact, this September, Cadbury downsized their brands again. I rarely buy UK chocolate now unless there is a really good sale or offer available.

And everything has to be 'healthy' these days, so the tasty ingredients are being replaced with healthier crappy tasting ones. Even our popular brand of crisps (or potato chips to everyone else) taste like shit now that they're cooked in Sunseed Oil. I don't see why we can't have a choice. If I want to eat shit, let me eat shit. I love junk food and snacks and I'm perfectly healthy. 6'1"" inch tall and 170lbs. 
I'm glad other countries don't give a crap (At least I think they don't). Some of the snacks I've bought from Cyber Candy are bloody huge and taste delicious compared to what we have here in the UK. 

The UK don't seem to like variety either. We're stuck with the same old chocolate and it very rare we get anything new or out of the ordinary. The most we'll get is a dark chocolate Mars Bar for a limit time,I'm sure they're pretty standard in other countries.

There's nothing over here that contains peanut butter either which is annoying. I love the Snickers Peanut Butter bar and all of the Reese products. I have actually seen Reese's Cups in Tesco once a twice so that's always a nice little treat. And I also love all of the M&amp;M varieties you have. We just have the 2 here. Milk chocolate and peanut. Bored of them now. Again, I think it's down to the UK not being fans of change. For example, Cadbury is a British company but when I visit Cyber Candy, it's full of weird and wonderful Cadbury products that can't be purchased by regular means inside of the UK. 

On the subject of breakfast foods though, Lucky Charms are legendary in the UK. Which is weird because they were available here about 15 years ago but then disappeared off the shelves. Yet, everyone here still remembers and loves them. They are like £7 ($11) a box if you want them imported. Totally worth it! I'm a massive fan of Poptarts too. Again, we only have two very boring and predictable varieties here. Chocolate and strawberry. Whereas in the US, you have loads of awesome flavours. I love the Blueberry ones. 

I'm going to shut up now, otherwise I will just keep going on about food.


EDIT: And Big Red gum! I love that stuff. It was also available here in the early 90's but disappeared. That stuff is the shit!

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt; thought you'd have more substantial arguments

I already made those arguments you how ever either ignored or dismissed them in favour of repeating your self in increasingly silly ways. You have done it in this reply in fact, you've ignored everything I actually challenged you on while at the same time calling my reply weak. That is troll territory. 

This is summed up easily, you have to choose. Either you believe in human rights or you don't. You can't talk about human rights while at the same time talking about how a human is not entitled to those very rights. 

If you want those rights to apply only to citizen then say so, at which point they are not human rights and I'd ask ""what happens when a natural born citizen is planning to commits an act of terror? do they have rights"" to which you'll no doubt reply ""no he for-fitted those rights through his actions"" or some such stupid shit. 

All of which means that these have gone from being universal human rights to being citizen rights to ""rights"" that only people you  think should have them get them.

At which point they are no longer rights.

In other words if we carry on this debate the outcome is most likely that in your view human rights are not for all humans and are not even rights. 

So please for fucks sake stop calling them human rights and actually own up to what you are suggesting. Which is that you want our government to be able to decide who should and should not have these ""rights"" on little more than what ever they happen to feel is convent.

At which point we could actually start talking about just how fuck nuts scary that situation is for the people of this nation.

But that's not going to happen so I wash my hands of this and I dearly hope that some of what I've said my have made a little home instead your head to plant the seeds of logic and reason... the soil is fucked but I can only hope they'll find a way to grow.

I hate it when people get angry at Eleven's on-screen progression from happy-go-lucky ""young man"" to burdened old man struggling to keep that smile on his face.

Really, when you think about it, it's similar to what happened to the Seventh Doctor. When he first came about, he was crazy and wacky but as danger approached more and more, he changed. He became manipulative, dark, he practically did a 180 in his whole personality in just a single Regeneration.

I think the danger that the Silence is posing is silently (no pun intended) and behind the scenes growing more and more prominent and Eleven is learning from his days as a younger man so he feels he he should apply the same principle here.

In comparison to the Doctor's previous regenerations of the revived series, it can be argued that Eleven has changed the most. Nine was always a bold, headstrong, battle-scarred old man who felt he should be dealing out justice. The Tenth was more merciful and forgiving. He gave everyone a chance to prove themselves. The only thing though was that in this incarnation, he realized that *he* upheld the laws of time (of course, this came back to bite him in the face and he realized that there's a difference between commanding law and obeying law)

Do I think it's a bad thing that the Eleventh has taken this stance? No way. It's brilliant and it's honest. No one can remain the same way forever, they *have* to change based on the circumstances or else life will escape from their fingertips and get the best of them.

This is why Matt Smith's been my favorite Doctor so far. He somehow manages to play an ancient man with ancient burdens and a young man living life to the fullest extent all at the same time.

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"Well he just got his scouting team in recently (after the transfer window closed) so we'll have to wait and see.  I'm guessing Assaidi and Yesil were already on the radar before Rodgers showed up; Borini and Allen were probably signed purely on his personal experience with them at Chelsea/Swansea.  We'll find out soon enough I guess what sort of players he's capable to signing.  I'm not too familiar with his tenure at Swansea and what sort of quality he brought in there, maybe severedfragile could lend his expertise to the discussion?

Carroll and Suarez are apples and oranges.  Suarez may very well end up being the player of the year in the EPL if he stays in his current form. If Carroll wasn't from England and wasn't a deadline day signing he would have been a 15-20m player at maximum.  Suarez is worth more than Torres was when we sold him IMO.  

I 100% agree we need another striker who can score goals, I just don't want that to be 2 players who come at the expense of Suarez.   [His assist today](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgun6OBB1_0) is a perfect example of us needing someone who can get on the end of his runs.  Something like this happens almost every game but we have no one supporting him, or if we do they are timid young players who are too hesitant to be a little selfish and get well forward.  Suarez ends up wasting the balls or taking an impossible shot.  Dirk would have been the perfect player for us to keep, he always found his way into space in the box when you needed him yet we let him go for a comically low price to save our wage bill (something like 4.5m).

Hutchinson probably would be a fringe player on most squads in the EPL I think, he's close to 30 years old and his highest competitive play has been in the Eredivisie.

JULIAN De Guzman plays for Canada, and he too is getting old and has only really played in the MLS as of late.  His younger and more talented brother JONATHAN is hoping for a call up to the Dutch team, for which he is eligible.

true,flyingkangaroo,null,null,"I'm frankly shocked at the nonsensical way that this documentary portrays Germany in that timeframe. The narrator makes Hitler out to be some sort of anti-christ figure that hypnotized the nation. 


Understanding German, I can see how really poetic and beautiful Hitler's speeches were. 

Hitler was not the focus of people's attention as much as the ideas which his movement represented. He was a fantastic orator - I've never seen anyone move an audience this way. The system of ideas he spoke about were seen as representing a wonderful and vibrant future for Germany. What we Anglophones often see as a stern, overbearing attitude is actually an earnestness which he practiced and put into his behavior whenever he was in public. You can see in the footage how universally loved he was. Even the children adored him.

Just as we see in Barack Obama's speeches, Hitler's words made constant reference to a greater vision, and to the history of the nation.

The kicker, of course, is that this system of ideas about German identity and society were a ticket to a quick and horrid disaster - not only for the people who were outsiders to that society but also for the German people themselves. The Nazi party led the nation into a black hole of death and destruction.

To understand how this works, one has to understand something that European philosophers like Descartes talked about again and again. The power of belief and world views over the human mind is very profound. Things don't have to be accurate to seem real - and if the belief is shared across the breadth of mainstream society, that gives even more salience to the matter.


What this sort of documentary ought to do, is to study the system of ideas that Hitler and others of that timeframe advocated and spoke about. That's where the meat of the story is to be found... because it's those ideas that resonated so deeply with the German people in that decade... and those models are responsible for the tragic turn which the country took.


I think that in this modern information age, there is no danger of such a person as Hitler rising to power again, anywhere in the world... because our discussions about policy are worldwide events, now. Anyone who has a stake in the matter can challenge ideas and worldviews - even anonymously, if they choose to do it that way. People in China and Iran frankly know that they're being screwed over by their government... and the end result will be inexorable political reform in a good direction.

For example *The God Complex* centers around Amy Pond (a companion of the Doctor) and her obsession over the Doctor, constantly trusting in him to save her. Without having seen *The Eleventh Hour* you're really not going to understand that crucial character dynamic.

And besides, *The Eleventh Hour* is a great introductory episode regardless. I implore you to at *least* watch from the beginning of Series Five onwards.

**EDIT**: If time is your reason for skipping try this abridged viewing list, as they appear in order. *Italicized* episodes are vital to overarching plots, **bold** episodes are great episodes, ***bold and italicized*** episodes are vital to overarching plots and are good, episodes that are normal are take-it-or-leave-it, episodes that are normal but have an asterisk* kind of suck, and episodes that are *italicized with an asterisk** are plot-vital but kind of suck 

* *Rose* (pilot, obviously a crucial episode)

* The End of the World (useful to understanding a plot arc in New Earth, but not very vital)

* The Unquiet Dead

* Aliens of London / World War Three

* ***Dalek*** (the series' first truly amazing episode)

* *The Long Game*

* Father's Day (kind of useful to understanding a Series Two plot, but not vital)

* **The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances** (Arguably the best episode of Doctor Who)

* **Boom Town**

* ***Bad Wolf / The Parting of the Ways*** (Series One finale, easily one of the best finales of the show)

* *The Christmas Invasion* (First episode of Series Two)

* *New Earth* (true beginning of 'Face of Boe' storyarc, not main arc)

* Tooth and Claw

* **School Reunion** (also reintroduces Sarah Jane, a recurring character)

* **The Girl in the Fireplace**

* *Rise of the Cybermen / The Age of Steel*

* The Idiot's Lantern*

* The Impossible Planet

* The Satan Pit

* Love and Monsters

* Fear Her*

* *Army of Ghosts* / *Doomsday* (Series Two Finale)

* *The Runaway Bride* (explains a fairly big question you'll have coming from Doomsday)

* *Smith and Jones* (introduces a new companion)

* The Shakespeare Code

* *Gridlock* (concludes the 'Face of Boe' storyarc, is overarching plot important)

* Daleks in Manhattan* / Evolution of the Daleks* (explains an element of Doomsday but not vital)

* The Lazarus Experiment

* 42

* **Human Nature / Family of Blood**

* **Blink**

* Utopia* / The Sound of Drums* / The Last of the Time Lords*

* Voyage of the Damned* (introduces recurring character, is Premier of Fourth Series, but not vital)

* **Partners in Crime**

* **Planet of the Ood** (explains character Sigma, not vital)

* The Fires of Pompeii

* The Sontaran Stratagem / The Poison Sky

* The Doctor's Daughter

* The Unicorn and the Wasp

* ***Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead***

* **Midnight** (Argued as one of the greatest episodes of Doctor Who)

* ***Turn Left***

* *The Stolen Earth / Journey's End* (Series Four Finale)

Then there are a series of feature-length episodes.

* The Next Doctor

* *The Waters of Mars*

* The Planet of the Dead

* *The End of Time Parts 1 &amp; 2* (Finale to the RTD Era. Big ending)

* ***The Eleventh Hour*** (Beginning of Moffat Era, new Doctor)

* The Beast Below

* *Victory of the Daleks** (Begins to explain subplot, returning villains. Is kind of shit)

* *The Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone** (Continues to explain main plot. Is also a bit shit)

* *The Vampires of Venice* (Reintroduces new companion)

* **Amy's Choice**

* *The Hungry Earth / Cold Blood* (Major plot development but is kind of bleh)

* **Vincent and the Doctor**

* **The Lodger**

* *The Big Bang / The Pandorica Opens** (Series Five finale)

* **A Christmas Carol** (Easily the best New Who special)

* *The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon** (Series Six premier, kind of sucks)

* The Curse of the Black Spot* (**REALLY** sucks)

*  **The Doctor's Wife**

* **The Rebel Flesh** / ***The Almost People*** (Important plot development)

* *A Good Man Goes to War** (Really important plot-wise, really sucky because of this)

* *Lets Kill Hitler** (More plot development, arguably one of Doctor Who's worst episodes)

* Night Terrors*

* The Girl Who Waited

* **The God Complex**

* **Closing Time** (**REALLY** good)

* *The Wedding of River Song** (Series Six finale)

* The Doctor, The Widow, and the Wardrobe* (Easily one of the *worst* Christmas specials)

* *Asylum of the Daleks* (Series 7.5 Premier)

*  Dinosaurs on a Spaceship (introduces recurring character, not vital)

* **A Town Called Mercy**

* *The Power of Three* (introduces new villian)

“And I thought, ‘well she’s really good. It’s just a shame she’s so wee and dumpy…When she was about to come through to the auditions I nipped out for a minute and I saw Karen walking on the corridor towards me and I realised she was 5’11, slim and gorgeous and I thought ‘Oh, oh that’ll probably work’.”

Also, have you never sat through the commercials on TV? Or been in the greeting card aisle of a grocery store? Or seen a Twilight bumper sticker in a parking lot? Or been inside a book store, where ""Teen Paranormal Romance"" is now its own genre and takes up multiple bookshelves? Have you not noticed the profound effect its popularity has had on our pop culture? The increasing number of movies and television series clearly modeled on the Twilight template? The rise of the Predatory Bad Boy archetype in the popular consciousness? The bestselling series of S&amp;M erotic novels that started off as Twilight fan-fic, and which your girlfriend, sister, mother, cousin, aunt, and female teachers are all reading?

This shit is not negligible, dude. It is pervasive. It gets into our heads. Hell, you may think it's harmless because it's ""just entertainment"". Most people do. But trust me, a work of fiction being considered “just entertainment” only makes its effects more penetrating and injurious. We lower our defenses in the face of what we think of as ""just entertainment"". We switch off our critical thinking, and that makes us more susceptible.

I'm going to link you to a couple of articles about the various ways in which the Twilight phenomenon is harming its readers, and society as a whole: 
 
* [Dangerous Liaisons](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/dec/04/twilight-film-vampire) 
  
* [Twilight's Feminist Backlash](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/15/twilight-feminist-backlash-bella) 
 
You think it's a coincidence that sociopolitically backward, anti-feminist, abuse excusing novels and movies and TV shows about submissive women who fall for domineering men have risen to such prominence at the same time as Republicans have been waging their war on women? I'm not talking conspiracy, mind you. I'm talking national consciousness. I'm talking habit forming behaviors. I'm talking about how what we read and watch influences the way we think. I'm talking about seismic shifts in cultural attitudes towards gender roles and sexuality having both pop-cultural and sociopolitical ramifications.

Think about it, dude.

I fell in love with the show in 2005 *because* of it's fair portrayal of women (and you know, the Doctor and all of space &amp; time), and I've watched as Moffat denegrated the females to stereotypes, the Doctor to a mere ""madman with a box"" as opposed to the smartest man in the universe, and slowly change the sci-fi into fantasy.

You're right, in that this existed long before Twilight, but I do not think Moffat's version of Doctor Who would be this successful (and it's actually *not* that successful compared to the RTD seasons) without an audience that's been primed by Twilight.

true,imbeingsirius,null,null,"**Sorry for the length, but I included quotes from Moffat**

You're right, all we'd seen up until season 5 (when they actively admit they use Harry Potter and Twilight as influences) is what I now believe to be the best of Moffat. Up until mid-season 5, I was excited! I loved his episodes; they were so different from the episodes surrounding them.

But in hindsight, we can see not the *influence* of Twilight, but the same attitude of misogyny and two-dimensionality present in both.

In all of Moffat's episodes under the RTD era he flings the female protagonist into a romance. Empty Child/Doctor Dances? Rose &amp; the Doctor and Rose &amp; Jack. Girl in the Fireplace? The Doctor &amp; Renee. Blink? The *awesome* Carey Mulligan &amp; the Cop AND Lawrence. Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead? The introduction of the Doctor's love interest, River, and Donna &amp; ... that stuttering guy.

Moffat quotes on the subject:
""There’s this issue you’re not allowed to discuss: that women are needy. Men can go for longer, more happily, without women. That’s the truth. We don’t, as little boys, play at being married - we try to avoid it for as long as possible. Meanwhile women are out there hunting for husbands.""



“I think the function of a companion is pretty simple. I don’t think that’s very difficult. It’s just a question of who credibly is going to agree to go in the TARDIS? Who’s going to do it? Is it going to be a mother of 15 children? No. Is it going to be someone in their 60s? No. Is there going to be a particular age range? I mean … who’s going to have a crush on the Doctor? You know, come on! It’s more than a format. It’s evolved from good, dramatic reasons.”



""And I thought, ‘well she’s really good. It’s just a shame she’s so wee and dumpy…When she was about to come through to the auditions I nipped out for a minute and I saw Karen walking on the corridor towards me and I realised she was 5’11, slim and gorgeous and I thought ‘Oh, oh that’ll probably work’.”
http://www.scotsman.com/news/time-lad-scores-with-sex-and-daleks-1-1394833




We also see the turn towards fantasy and his anti-science fiction feelings (he has talked in length in interviews about his disdain for the genre. The HEADwriter of *Doctor Who*). We get funny but telling phrases such as ""Magic door"" ""Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey"". Moffat rarely cares to explain what's happening and instead favors creepy/eerie plots. When he does offer an explanation, it's almost always technodystopian, meaning it is science/technology/progress which has turned against us (the nanogenes, the spaceship/clockwork robots etc).

Without RTD to invent the characters and balance him out, Moffat is nothing more than a sitcom writer, full of paper-thin characters, makeshift romances, lazy writing that relies on catchphrases, and Twilight/Tim Burton fantasy.

I can still enjoy Doctor Who, but it's not the same way I did in the sci-fi RTD era. And lately... well, it's been said.

Luckily, history repeats itself. Since 1963 the show has undergone more drastic changes than this. Each Doctor kind of ushered in a new era to the show. And if the revival parallels the original, the First, like the Ninth was a harder, darker era of the show. 

In the second era, the Second and Tenth were there as the show matured into it's fanbase.

However, In this third era with the Third/Eleventh, the show became something completely different. For most of the Third Doctor's run, the Doctor was stranded on Earth. The TARDIS was basically a background gag. The Doctor knew martial arts, drove cars, used gadgets, and the show was in color. In the Eleventh's the show became fairytale-like and turned women into stereotypes the Doctor was rapping at some point.

The show may seem like it's falling apart, but if we look at those three eras, what comes next? The era of Four/Twelve. We know that the Fourth Doctor is to this day, considered by many to be the most iconic Doctor of the classic series, he changed the show back from a karate chopping, gadget-wielding Avengers(UK) ripoff, back to a space-travelling adventure-mystery. Some consider the Fourth Doctor to be the best Doctor of all time. So what can we expect from the Twelfth?

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"I meant that I put Ibra, Suarez, and RVP in that elite class and that having one would be good for any team. United are in a similar position to City, in that they are extremely top heavy and need to sort out their backline and midfield far more than their striking options.

Mancini and the City board are not stupid with money. They're not going to throw down stupid money for no reason and there is no reason for them to throw around January money when they know that they have a Champions League place basically locked up already. If they want to restructure the team, there will be ample opportunities in the summer, where offloading Dzeko and Balloteli will be easy and drafting in a replacement (even if Falcao goes to Chelsea in January) will be easier as well. 

If they think they can get Suarez on the relative cheap, which 40m probably would be (someone mentioned compare Suarez now to Torres when we sold him), they'll go for it, but it's a cheeky bid more than anything else. If Mancini is serious about Suarez, here is what is more likely going to happen. Bid in January, get rejected, bid up a little higher, but not too high, get rejected, wait. Liverpool buy a new striker and see what happens. If we still finish relatively poorly, talk up Suarez to the media, praise him highly, offload Balotelli and Dzeko and make way for Suarez, get him from underperforming, no CL Liverpool to title-contenders City. Even if we do well, it would be easier to get Suarez in the summer, because we could reinvest the money then to bolster the squad how we need.

There is just no reason for Mancini to go for Suarez in January. He has the attacking options to win the title. He did it last season, and while RVP to United is pretty powerful, the ability to win every game 3-2 won't hold up over an entire season. City need to dig in their heels and stop drawing games they should win and shore up their midfield, and get Joe Hart's form back. Spending huge amounts of money on Suarez won't help Mancini win this year's league, since the gap will either be too large to close, or small enough that they could overtake United or Chelsea anyway if they play well. 

I've no doubt there's interest; it would be stupid of any top club to ignore Suarez. I'm sure there's interest from Chelsea and PSG and even clubs like Real Madrid and Barca. Suarez is one of the best players in the world and he's in ridiculously good form right now. That doesn't change the fact that he loves our club, just signed a new long-term deal, and seems willing to believe in Rodgers' vision.

We've recently extradited two men on terrorist charges (well I think it's running a crappy website for a short time years ago) only, a few days later, to make a ruling about another extradition case that would have stopped that from happening. Julian Assanage, a man who's been granted asylum by Ecuador on human rights grounds will be arrested if he steps foot out of their embassy where he will be extradite to Sweden. That granting of a asylum is a bit strange because it's based on the Idea that Sweden would extradite him to the USA where he may face the death penalty for what some view as acts of free expression. That is a cluster fuck of a case and it's hard to work out who's in the right there. I'd air on the side of caution but the courts don't agree but I bring it up because we quite literally threatened to raid an embassy to get our hands on him and we are in the crazy place that he will be arrested in the walk from the front door to a car... and this is a case in which we are talking about the extradition of some one who is not a citizen and who has been granted asylum on human rights ground. 

In short your question is mind numbingly stupid. Let me rephrase it for you to what you actually mean.

""if the law was changed so that we could extradite people to places that may violate their human rights would you have a problem with that?""

This is an argument for lowering taxes, not stricter enforcement.

Tax avoidance is an overhead cost for companies. It's by no means easy to do, and it requires a lot of work and a lot of hassle. It's only done because the costs of avoiding taxes are lower than the costs of paying them. Additionally, it's a PR risk (as Starbucks et. al. have recently discovered). 

Making tax avoidance less profitable, by lowering taxes, would likely increase tax compliance and yield **greater revenue from taxation**.

If our Government's taxes are making British business un-competitive, to the extent that tax avoidance is becoming a real problem, then we have no chance of competing against exports from low-taxed, more economically liberal countries. That tax avoidance is so commonplace is an indicator of an overburdened and overtaxed private sector.

Full time work is defined as being *over* 16 hours a week, so that's really 17+ hours. I don't know what the maximum is you're allowed to work but I'm guessing the skys the limit.

Working for 16 hours a week entitles you to pick up quite a lot of benefit. I don't know how the benefits system works but I know you can get housing benefit, working tax credits, reductions in council tax and probably other bits and bobs that inflate your earnings to a more comfortable level.

The government also provides free education up until college level and then low interest long-term loans to pay for higher education so all people from all walks of life can earn qualifications to improve their chances at getting a job working 37.5 hours a week on a good salary.

MPs need to start to understand that tax rules can't be based on some subjective concept like ""morality"". It is not immoral to minimize what you owe; it is perfectly normal behaviour.

The solution lies in fixing whatever is broken about the tax rules. I sometimes think that tax laws should be designed by physicists instead of economists. They would not try to fix tax avoidance by adding increasing complex extra rules to try to plug the holes. They would try to find a system which is self-consistent within itself so that there are no leaks or workarounds. It is like the concept of a conservative force:

This is where the wealth has accumulated over the last few centuries. Last year the UK experienced 1.1% real GDP growth. China and India saw 9.5 and 7.8% respectively.

&gt;There is no excuse for not forcing them to pay tax correctly. None. Loopholes like keeping your IP in another country are obvious tax avoidance schemes and should be declared illegal.

As I pointed out in my original comment, high taxes encourage tax avoidance. Lowering taxes increases tax compliance, which can create more tax revenue.

It's better from an employment, markets and living standards perspective, to have many players paying a lower rate of tax, than a few players paying a higher rate of tax. Lower taxes ensure higher compliance, while lowering the barrier of entry to the market and stimulating SME growth, resulting in more employment.

&gt;So if myself, and a group of friends, decide to keep the fruits of our labour, and voluntarily employ each other on our own terms, and exchange our goods voluntarily amongst ourselves, we would be left to ourselves?

You make it sound so sweet, but we all know that's not how capitalism works as an economic system.  It's not a small bunch of **friends** of **similar social and economic status** beginning on day one **with a tabla rasa** agreeing **voluntarily** to employ each other.  In reality, capitalism is a global economic system with hundreds of years of State violence, robbery and theft underpinning it, and continues today with an immensely heavy State hand on the scales to keep workers either at home or, more commonly these days overseas, so impoverished and bereft of means of production, land and alternatives that they view working in a grim sweat shop for a pittance as preferable to the alternatives.  The economic imbalances are so extreme that 1% of transnational corporations own 40% of global business wealth, and, in the US, for example, the Walton family's heirs own the same amount of wealth as the bottom 40% of Americans combined - that's 6 people having the same wealth as 125 million people. Turning to the UK, the figures are similar here, and on land we're particularly bad.  0.36% of our population owns two thirds of the land, many holdings dating back to William the Conqueror, whilst 24 million of the rest of us are squeezed onto tiny handkerchief plots amounting to around 3 million acres, if we're lucky enough to have any land at all.  That's not the basis for anything ""voluntary"", or for choosing ""freely"" to enter labour contracts, and there's zero chance we'll extract the full fruits of our labour.  

Indeed back when we had land, that was one of the principle complaints and the legislative cry of the mercantilist masters - these lazy bastards won't work, and if and when we can persuade them to, they want short, flexible hours and outrageous wages.  I wonder why that might be?  And I wonder why the State was so keen to pass all the necessary laws in the service of ""free"" market capitalism to make sure this didn't continue...

Incorrect.

The guard has been found guilty of gross negligence.  If he saw her leaning on the carriage and told the train to pull away, he is at fault.  There are rules and laws on our railway, he broke a major one.  This is very much his fault.

Her intoxication isn't even the issue here.  It a sober person was learning on a carriage, the guard should not tell the train to move.  

Don't act like the parents failed because a teenager went to a party and got fucked up.  Many teenagers that have been brought up ""perfectly"" will still do silly things, don't act like it's just ""the bad ones"" that get drunk etc.

Her friends no doubt were also drunk since they're at a party, so no, they shouldn't take responsibility for someone wondering off on their own.  That girl is responsible for her own actions.

The train guard should not have told the train to move on if someone was leaning on the carriage.  He did and that's what caused this incident.

When I worked on the railway, had I taken my eyes off the track and not warned my crew in time to get off the tracks, I'd be in prison.  Everyone that works on or near the line has a lot of rules to follow, some complex, some simple.  He broke a simple one and the consequence was a death.

She may have been a drunken idiot, but he chose to tell the train to move with someone leaning on a carriage.  When he should have walked up, removed her then told the train to move off.

I will most definitely not be casting a vote for a candidate, but should I spoil my vote or abstain?

I would really like to register my displeasure by spoiling my ballot, but on the other hand I don't want to increase turnout figures. In the final count nothing differentiates a spoiled ballot based on sound reasoning and political conviction from a spoiled ballot by a fruitloop. Equally, in the final count nothing differentiates abstention from apathy.

Choosing to vote for an independent rather than a party affiliated candidate 'to keep the politics out of policing' seems like a bad idea. It presupposes the job should ever exist, when it most definitely should not. Even if a relatively benign candidate wins this time there's nothing to say an utra-loony won't get in next time, or the role becomes ever more politicised over time.

Spoil my ballot and be ignored, or don't vote and be ignored?

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;The economic imbalances are so extreme that 1% of transnational corporations own 40% of global business wealth, and, in the US, for example, the Walton family's heirs own the same mount of wealth as the bottom 40% of Americans combined - that's 6 people having the same wealth as 125 million people. Turning to the UK, the figures are similar here, and on land we're particularly bad. 0.36% of our population owns two thirds of the land, many holdings dating back to William the Conqueror, whilst 24 million of the rest of us are squeezed onto tiny handkerchief plots amounting to around 3 million acres, if we're lucky enough to have any land at all.

I'm pissed off about these economic imbalances too. I share the same humanitarian beliefs as most socialists, that is, I want people everywhere to be happy, healthy, free individuals, able to live their lives as they see fit. It's not like I wake up in the morning and think ""Hmm, I wonder how many poor people I can oppress today?"". 

The problem is, freedoms are important. Individual freedoms, economic freedoms, political freedoms. Socialism has (historically) had a tendancy to sweep these humanitarian principles away in the pursuit of utilitarian ideology. 

It's like the issue of disabled people and eugenics. Socialist Sweden in the 1970s embarked on a campaign of forced sterilisation and lobotomisation of disabled and mentally handicapped people, in the name of protecting and securing the health of it's people.

I specifically chose that example, and not one of the countless genocides/holocausts conducted in the name of socialism in the C20th, because Sweden is not a communist country, it's a socialist country, and it prevents the typical socialist response ""yeah but it's not Democratic socialism!""

It's the casual way that socialists neglect issues of civil liberties, economic and political freedoms, to violently enforce their ideology on others, that makes the common man feel threatened and alienated by socialists.

Additionally the land issue in the UK is not the product of capitalism, given that the Queen is the biggest land owner, on a unit area basis. I get the feeling we can both agree that the state is more of a hindrance than a help, regardless of economic system.

Fair enough. But is the solution to just keep patching away at the rules trying to say what activities are deemed immoral or unacceptable or whatever? 

&gt; I have no idea what relevance your conservative force example has other than making you sound clever. A conservative force relies on conservation of energy, and money is not conserved.

The point I was thinking about is that you can't avoid the effect of a conservative force - it gets you in exactly the same way no matter what path you take. In a similar way you want a set of tax rules so that somehow you manage to get the same fraction of a company's profits no matter what clever means they use to label them as they move them around the organisation. So yes - you could think of it as wanting a law of conservation of profits. Money in general is not conserved, but if you created a profit and loss account for the whole company it would have to be consistent with the result of combining the profit and loss accounts of all its subsidiaries.

When profits flow over a boundary between two separate tax regimes we want to make sure that we get our cut before those profits leave our regime.

I share the same humanitarian beliefs as most socialists, that is, I want people everywhere to be happy, healthy, free individuals, able to live their lives as they see fit. It's not like I wake up in the morning and think ""Hmm, I wonder how many poor people I can oppress today?"". 

Fair point, and I honestly don't impute your motives, as I trust you don't impute mine.  Of course, there certainly are wicked capitalists, just as there are wicked socialists, but it's not a necessary characteristic for either - I'm sure we can agree on that.  Your problem is what you perceive as socialism and mine is what I perceive as capitalism.

&gt;The problem is, freedoms are important. Individual freedoms, economic freedoms, political freedoms. Socialism has (historically) had a tendancy to sweep these humanitarian principles away in the pursuit of utilitarian ideology. 

Indeed they are.  I am fundamentally a libertarian.  If I remotely suspected my socialism was incompatible with freedom, I would reluctantly abandon it, but not only don't I, I see socialism as the sine qua non of genuine freedom.  

&gt;It's like the issue of disabled people and eugenics. Socialist Sweden in the 1970s embarked on a campaign of forced sterilisation and lobotomisation of disabled and mentally handicapped people, in the name of protecting and securing the health of it's people.

Indeed it did, and that was wrong, quite disgusting in fact.  But, I'd put up several counters to that.  Firstly, Sweden is a capitalist country.  Social democratic yes, but still fundamentally capitalist.  Secondly, remember where eugenics came from and where it was also enthusiastically implemented for a time?  That's right, capitalist Britain and capitalist USA - indeed Hitler complemented the US effusively on their eugenics programme.  To be fair, in both countries adherents could be found across the political spectrum, but I don't think it's something you can particularly lay at the door of socialism (though I know you want to!)

I'd give you similar answers on the USSR, China and various other experiments in creating the perfect socialist State, none of them really progressed far beyond State capitalism, and almost all of them were poor, pre-industrial societies which sought to _force_ capitalism, with horrific results.  None of them were libertarian socialist either, indeed, in the case of the USSR, they were quick to eliminate or drive out all those of that persuasion, and if you look at the warnings of the anarchists, libertarian Marxists and so on, they were hugely prescient.

A number of countries have introduced what are called General Anti Avoidance Rules, which ban any financial structure which are judged by the courts to be primarily for avoiding tax.

I apologise for being rude about your physics suggestion, but there is a history of dubious connections between economics and physics. The Black-Scholes equation, which gave a false sense of the risk of leveraging bank capital, and which played a major role in the financial crisis, is also based on a physical model of the dynamics of gases. It was flawed because humans do not behave rationally, but rather respond in great rushes and panics. In general I think the economy is too much of a hybrid, nasty, chaotic system to apply physics to it. Such a thing may be a very long term goal of theoretical economics, requiring a complete restructuring of the  economic system on axiomatic foundations, but in the short term it is a distraction from implementing the much more modest, pragmatic solutions which are necessary right now.

We can't arbitrarily tell companies they owe us more tax; that would cause a stock market crash along with god knows how many unintended side effects.

Remember that this isn't just moving money from one account to another; Starbucks is actually paying for stuff from its other groups (albiet in a global system set up to move money for this purpose). So what you've got to somehow do is stop companies shifting money about like this without having any negative impact on companies which *need* to shift money about like this (eg; car manufacturers which buy parts from plants in other countries).

That's actually very bloody hard to do, but anything else might seriously harm our already stagnating economy.

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","I think it's jealousy by many, sucking the cock of tabloid propaganda that all Squatters are shits (as demonstrated by IIoWoII above). Thing is, squatters in the majority are no different to most others, just there is this minority of incidents that are being hugely overhyped by the press.  Now loads of people are up in arms about how all the squatters are hijacking people's properties while on holiday, which is sourced from very a small minority. 

The premise on introducing this anti-squatter law is utter bollocks too, it's putting every squatter into one basket. Now, a law I would support (and makes rational sense) is that squatters can be forcefully evicted if they occupy a property which is currently being lived in, there is no rights for these actions as the property is in use by a family or individual, that is only as far the amendment should of gone. Instead the Tories have used it as an excuse to grab back private property and leave it empty while the entire country has a gigantic housing shortage and large unemployment problem.  

In my opinion, if someone decided to leave a property unoccupied for a long period of time, you have to take the responsibility that someone will try to get out of the cold/rain. If you're being greedy by not letting it or being charitably with the property, it's your own fault and you deserve people to fuck you about in my opinion. Take responsibility for your community you greedy fucks!

Fact is, finding a job that pays enough for London rent rates is incredibly difficult, so his only option is to live in the squat (do as many odd jobs as possible to eat and survive) and hopes that it will remain undisturbed at least to the end of the winter.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It's interesting to look at the situation as it is currently emerging. In Britain, the Treasury is currently trying to introduce a law called the [General Anti Abuse Rule](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/tax_avoidance_gaar.htm), which is designed so that judges can look at a particular legal or financial structure, and say that it is manifestly abusive, and therefore illegal, without having to have a specific rule banning that particular structure. But it is designed to go after pre-packaged tax-avoiding structures, usually for individuals, essentially the sort of thing which Jimmy Carr was involved in. On the other hand, the rule is not designed to go after Transfer Pricing, because the people in charge think that Transfer Pricing is actually a good thing. From the head of HMRC, Lin Homer, in [evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee the other day](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d735be3a-2389-11e2-bb86-00144feabdc0.html):

&gt; “One of the challenges for people to understand is that in broad terms companies are required to pay corporate tax in the country where they carry on the economic activity, not necessarily where their customers are located. That is something that it is understandable they don’t get. But obviously my people need to get that and that is perhaps one of the things that gets lost in some of this discussion.”

In other words, if Amazon operates in Luxembourg, in an environment with no corporation tax, they have no obligation to pay corporation tax where their customers are, in Britain. And presumably if Starbucks creates the branding and the recipes elsewhere, it doesn't have to pay corporation tax where its customers are. But such a rule is nothing but a manifesto for the abolition of corporation tax, because clearly a company operating in a zero tax environment is always going to outcompete a company operating in a 30% tax environment.

This is all to do with whether countries are actually allowed to set their own tax affairs, for businesses selling into their market. Australia has a similar rule to what we are proposing in the UK, but which is much more broad-based, designed to actually go after Transfer Pricing, which is known, confusingly from a British perspective, as the General Anti *Avoidance* (rather than Abuse) Rule. Here's a section from [a recent Ernst and Young](http://www.ey.com/CN/en/Services/Tax/APAC-Tax-Matters---July-2012) report about changes introduced to go after Transfer Pricing in Australia:

&gt; **The changes are intended to 'clarify' and confirm the Australian Taxation
Office's (ATO) long standing and highly controversial view that Australia's tax
treaties provide a separate and unconstrained taxing power.** These changes
will have a significant impact on the transfer pricing landscape in Australia and
for businesses which have based their tax positions and processes on the
existing law. The greatest impact will be for businesses which have international transactions
and, in particular ... ► Foreign owned businesses with related party transactions and overall low profit margins or losses [that means Starbucks buying intellectual property from related companies, and in so doing shifting profits abroad]

true,eudaimonist,uk,United Kingdom,"This is obviously a tricky area.

The first thing to say is that it must be horrific for the family and it's hugely unfortunate that this happened. I imagine that similar situations with drunked passengers and inattentive guards happen every day but luckily nobody is hurt in those instances so they're not brought to our attention.

The guard clearly failed his responsibilities. He had a duty of care and he broke that duty of care. 

People don't realise how extensive their duties of care are - in a past life I've worked as a lifeguard whilst studying for a law degree and my colleagues were genuinely shocked to know that they could be imprisoned if anyone drowned on their watch if they failed their duty of care.

I also think it's clear that the girl should not have been that drunk at that age and not in a safe place. There was a lack of responsibility here both on her part and that of her friends - perhaps that's to be expected at 16 when in a group of friends, but I think we should ask people to be responsible for their own safety.

This could've ended a hundred different ways if things were different. 98 of those times the girl wouldn't have died, the guard wouldn't have a custodial sentence and we'd probably never hear about it.

It's tragic that it ended this way, for both the guard and the girl, as well as their families. A moment's inattention or frustration by the guard and a drunken stumble by the girl. I doubt either had any idea this would be the result.

I don't feel like there are any easy answers here, I don't think you can say 'what an evil man who killed this girl' or 'this girl was so drunk it's all her own fault'. If only he had been slightly more attentive or she slightly less drunk or her friends slightly more aware or...or...one of any number of things. It's messy and complicated - but most of all tragic. 

Who of us hasn't, at one time, been so drunk that we could've compromised our own safety?

Who of us hasn't had a long, tiring day at work and taken a shortcut or missed something that could, potentially, have caused someone else harm?

I've done both - and I'm lucky enough that nothing serious has come of it. Things like this make me realise that it is luck.

I do think that five years is a harsh sentence, but I can see how it was arrived at. I'm also not sure what I would think a fair sentence would be. It's just too big for me to comprehend. How do you put the value on this? A life? A moment's inattention? Haste to finish your shift? A one in a million risk that went bad? Blame is easy to give out.

Thoughts are with both families.

No so - we didn't have solid proof for their existence, but we did have much to reasonably suspect (including a history of having them and actually using them). The quality of the assessment made of that evidence was dreadful.

&gt; And Hans Blix was totally against the war by the way

Yes he was. But even from that position he is able to say that he understand why lots of people managed to convince themselves that Iraq did have them - because Iraq wanted the world to believe they had them. He certainly had deep suspicions they had them, but quite rightly wanted to make sure either way before any action way taken. Just after the war started his position was ""Hans Blix, said he was starting to suspect Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction in advance of the war on Iraq"" - i.e. quite far away from being sure that there were none. 

I'm not saying that the war was right (it was wrong) and I'm not saying TB is a saint or he was even good. I am saying that you shouldnt demonise him on the basis that he got it wrong.

Nonsense. Not all money does the same work. Money in people's pockets that is being saved, or spent abroad, or being spent on luxury items that employ few people per pound are not the same as the work done by government spend.

The reason the old age pension was introduced in the first place was recognition of the fact that if you use progressive taxation to skim the wealth of the rich and relocate that money amongst the old that produces enormous net benefits for the economy as a whole. The reason is that old people spend all of that money and most of that money is spent locally where it does a lot of floating about.

true,MrPhatBob,northumberland,Cambridge/Newmarket,"But normalising the pay levels it will become less likley to attract the better players, the private sector can then collect the best of the State educated workforce and leave the rest to work in Government.

When you mentioned that ""Putting money back in peoples pockets is absolutely the worst thing you can do with it as the last 20 years have shown."" it seemed to me that you were mandating far more state control of the individual's money, not just that of the government's.  It wasnt the money in their pockets that was the problem, it was the huge debt and artificial wealth that they were allowed to amass.

The Victorian reply is a straw-man, health and medicine has improved in countries that dont have free health care, its an indication of a country's wealth that living standards increase along with wealth.  The country's wealth is generated by and large by private enterprise, the government takes a cut in the form of Taxes - they always did even in Victorian times.

Avoiding Tax has been going on since God was a boy, it wont take much looking to find a large house near you with bricks where the windows should have been in order to avoid the Window Tax.  Everyone loved the Smuggler and hated the Duty man because of cheap booze.

Yes theres a cost for infrastructure, great civil engineering projects have been carried out using public and private money, if you want to look at Victorian times then lets consider the railways.  Railway companies were privately owned businesses that made it possible for the common person to travel as far across Britain as they could afford, the owners of the railways invested in bridges and viaducts, built tunnels, employed masses of people.

Then it got privatised and... well that didn't work out too well, and the subsequent de-privatisation has not really worked very well at all.

That's media senationalism. Remember, the media doesn't like AVB, nor can they fathom that Lloris isn't an automatic starter - so because they can't imagine it, clearly Lloris can't handle it either.

Lloris is just fine at Spurs - he goofed up badly in their last Europa League game as well, IIRC, so I daresay it'd be a bit rich of him to complain about not being the first-choice keeper at the moment. AVB has said Lloris needs time to adapt to English football, and he's right.

When was the last time Spurs was lowballed? They just bought Lloris, he's not going anywhere anytime soon, and he'll certainly be their first choice keeper by the end of the season, if not the start of next season.

The Police officer is not guilty of any offence; his conviction was quashed on appeal. In the eyes of the courts he has not committed a criminal offence. Thusly the justification for removing him from his job has been removed. The police removed him for using excessive force and behaviour not appropriate for a police officer.

As he had his conviction quashed he appealed his dismissal, the police argued against this. However the court rules that as he is guilty of no criminal offence the grounds for which he was removed from his job no longer exist, as there are no legal grounds this is unlawful. If the police did not give him his job back they would be breaking the law.

Throughout this process the Police force continually fought the ruling that the officer should be reinstated. However to not do so would be unlawful.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;I suppose it is understandable if they were hesitant to delve too deeply before seeing that Rodgers was the real deal.

I see what you're saying but I really hope that wasn't the case. Would FSG really hire a young manager to one of the biggest, high-pressure jobs in the country, then **not** improve the team to see what Rodgers can do with a thin squad? That seems to be a huge gamble and not too much confidence in Rodgers (then why hire him in the first place?).

I personally think FSG and Ian Ayre simply fucked up the August window. I think they tried to call some bluffs and they were caught on the short end of it. There was no way they'd ship away Andy Carroll and not bring another striker in.

Rodgers has done an admirable job with the squad he has and hopefully FSG see that and bring in the players he wants/needs (i.e. two strikers).

&gt;t's not like we have a massive squad we can trim the fat from (bar Joe Cole).

Well, if we move Joe Cole (even on-loan, even if we pay half his wages) and Stewart Downing ... we would have the wages to pay for, say, a Huntelaar and/or, say, a Walcott without making too much of a change in payroll. Also, Andy Carroll's wages are off the books this season too. Hell, if it means we get a quality striker, Jose Enrique and his wages could be moved too.

Simply put ... If we look at it from a money-out/money-in point of view, we have the ways to make the wages work. We have the money. We just need Rodgers and Ayre to bring the players in.",0,1352999321,null,0,false,0,c71tdik,t3_137edr,t1_c71tdik,t1_c71mdos,null,1430413756,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/11/14/wayne-k-spear-if-greeces-disease-doesnt-kill-it-golden-dawns-cure-may/

&gt; The polls are now suggesting a favourable view of Golden Dawn among twenty-two percent of the population, a number corresponding exactly with the standing of Canada’s Liberal party. “None of them” is now the top choice (at 40%) of the had-it-up-to-here Greek voters. This has provoked anguished recollections of the Treaty of Paris and the resulting economic and political catastrophes which soon brought down the Weimar Republic and raised up the NSDAP, otherwise known as the National Socialists, or Nazis.

Democracies have a vulnerability as follows. The economy collapses and most people see things getting worse in the medium to long term. A formerly fringe political party gets &gt;20% of the vote.

Now in Germany this was the Communists, not the Nazis. Still the prospect of Stalinist Communism (including things like [collectivisation which was then happening in the USSR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union)) scared people and the Nazis were a reaction to it. 

At some point there is a self fulfilling prophecy that the democratic system is doomed. People who are left of centre but not extremist switch to the extreme left as a less bad option than the extreme right and vice versa.

The Nazis cleverly portrayed themselves as being a barrier to Bolshevism with the implication they were a conservative force. Actually of course they were nothing of the sort, but they were smart enough to play that down until they got close enough to political power to take over completely. Even after that I think most people on the right did not see how radically crazy their program was.

So when the economy turns to shit it's not like people can decide to stick with the normal political parties. Everyone knows the democratic system is going away and it becomes a question of which system to replace it with. 

So Golden Dawn opens up the possibility of a mirror image far left party which is also aiming to sweep away the political system.

Maybe you get a political crisis like this every 80 years or so. In fact it's probably like Earthquakes.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law

&gt; A power law is a mathematical relationship between two quantities. When the frequency of an event varies as a power of some attribute of that event (e.g. its size), the frequency is said to follow a power law. For instance, the number of cities having a certain population size is found to vary as a power of the size of the population, and hence follows a power law. There is evidence that the distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and man-made phenomena follow a power law, including the sizes of earthquakes, craters on the moon and of solar flares,[1] the foraging pattern of various species,[2] the sizes of activity patterns of neuronal populations,[3] the frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, the species richness in clades of organisms,[4] the sizes of power outages and wars,[5] and many other quantities.

At best, we get a fantastic striker who is young, has an understanding with Suarez, and would be a brilliant player for LFC for years to come. Cavani is an investment that every club would want to make.

Are wages a concern? Move Downing and his wages. Even if we loan out Joe Cole and pay half his wages, we free up some money there. Carroll and his wages are off the books. Hell, move Enrique and/or Henderson if we need to free up money for Cavani's wages.

People think it is just the odd cow that gets TB but sometimes it can be a whole farm of 200+ cattle that has been brought in for slaughter. The amount of badgers they want to cull compared to the number of cows destroyed is tiny. Many of the cows destroyed are just suspected so they are often missed of official figures.

The worrying part is that many abattoirs have meat inspectors from Europe with less training and skills than the UK trained ones have so lots of stuff that shouldn't get through now does.

The men we handed the country over to aren't bombing their own people with chemical weapons so I think to compare them with Saddam is pretty obviously ridiculous.

The sanctions were imposed by the UN, not just the US and UK.

Not at all - I don't think anyone is/should be untouchable, not completely. The reality is that some people are able to use their influence (case in point is Savile apparently threatening to stop his charity fund-raising if paper's accused him of anything, I think) and who-they-knows to avoid accusations sometimes, or paying people off. But even ignoring that it's well known there are a myriad of reasons as to why people don't come forward after things like this, particularly young people who were taken advantage of.

Are you coming at it from a: ""well if they really were assaulted then they should have reported it at the time"" direction? If that's the case it's rather naive.

The meter calculates the maximum fare based on:

* Time of day
* Distance travelled
* Time taken

So, it looks like time is a factor but they don't say quite how it is calculated.

Distances seem to have a maximum journey time, so I imagine if that is exceeded then the fare is bumped into the next distance frame. I.e. 1 mile is 6-13 minutes from £5.60 to £8.60, but if your journey time is 14 minutes but only 1 mile, then you get bumped in to the 10-20 minute (2 mile) bracket and are charged somewhere between not less than £8.60 and up to £13.40.

The group has paid more than £130 million in tax since 2001, and HMRC deems GMG to be low risk. GMG has not paid corporation tax in recent years because it has been in loss. In 2008 GMG sold half of Auto Trader publisher Trader Media Group and made an exceptional (one-off) profit of more than £300 million. No tax was payable on the return from that sale because under UK law GMG qualified for SSE (the substantial shareholdings exemption).

The idea they are compatible belongs in the 19th Century before it was found that capitalism isn't imposed on society by a minority of wealthy individuals but is a natural state of human societies, and requires coercion by socialist states to prevent its re-emergence.

I know a Lithuanian farmer's son. Under the soviets farmland was divided out equally among families in the area. His grandfather rented land from a number of families, and farmed it as if it was one farm (and for profit). He was sent to a labour camp for it.

People will naturally buy and sell things for profit. People will naturally pay others for labour, and then sell that product of that labour for profit. People will naturally labour in return for a wage, even though they know it will turn a profit for someone else.

If people have the freedom of voluntary association, capitalism will re-establish itself. To protect a socialist economy a state must use coercion to deny a human right. This is incompatible with libertarianism.

I have no idea where your idea of a ""left wing pass"" came from, im simply pointing out that fascist does not exclude socialist. look at Stalin for another example. 

I in no way support the Nazis or other fascists, but it would be false to claim that socialist principles were not a part of their ideologies. Hitler did accept private property and so was obviously not a totally pure socialist/communist but many others within his party, especially at the beginning did not. Mussolini was openly against capitalism.

If individual police can't be members of political parties, why should a whole police force be run with a political agenda. Keep politics out of policing.

Police commissioners don't seem like they'll do much good, but I don't see the logic of the 'keep politics out of policing' line. Policing is absolutely political. The law is the law but the police have a lot of freedom in how they apply it. Police heads exert power over their force, and there's no reason not to see that power as political... I'm sure they control budgets, regulations, priorities, etc... politics entails the conflicts that affect all of us, and policing fits the bill.

I guess you might mean that *partisan* politics should be kept out of policing. But then, it's not like parties are going to matter. All candidates, regardless of party, will push for precisely the same thing -- whatever is popular. And what is popular is pretty damn consistent and universal in regards to law and order. People want more police on the street. People want harsher punishments. People want less crime.

OK - so what was your reasoning behind asking the question: ""Why was she there on her own with him""? Genuine question, because I grant you that I could have leapt to the conclusion that you meant ""She shouldn't have got herself into that situation.""

But so far as I can see the question is irrelevant in any case. I'm not sure how it could have a bearing on the issue.

&gt; (remember that, innocent until proven guilty?)

Yeah I do - and it's the order of play over here too. I can assure I am keeping nothing but a neutral stance on the happenings and generally do with anything like this (except for some cases where there are ~300+ complaints. That sorta swings it imo). That includes wondering as to whether or not the alleged victim is in it to make a name for herself (has anyone ever managed that btw?).

&gt;  I'm just suggesting that something relatively minor being brought up after 35 years maybe isn't all black and white.

But you phrased it as though the person making the allegation was some how in it for the publicity.    
By the way:

&gt; something relatively minor 

You should tell the alleged victim that it's a trivial matter. I get the impression that she, and others in a similar situation, might just disagree.

&gt;  I just have doubts because of the length of time.

Do you have doubts about the allegations against Savile, taken en masse, or would you on an individual basis?

The problem with the line (taken by many when the Savile allegations first started coming out too) is that ""Why has he/she waited until now/so long before saying anything?"" is that it's not at all the correct question to ask. A better one would, in numerous cases, be: ""Why did no-one believe them at the time?"" or ""Why did he/she not feel able to say anything at the time?""

With the Savile allegations I've heard a number of people describe how they told a parent or a teacher and that person said ""Don't make up such terrible lies about Mr Savile - he's wonderful and does great things for us"" and similar. One girl at that home claims she was put into isolation for alleging an assault against Savile. People don't come forward for a number of reasons, but one major one is because they feel they wouldn't be believed. 

How long after an alleged assault takes place would you say is 'too long' too report it?

All this is personal opinion, you understand, but none of Moffat's established entries to *Doctor Who* canon do anything for me. I actively dislike the River Song character: she's just a walking one-liner machine, with a wink and a flirt here and there for her interactions with other characters.

The ""Silence Will Fall"" arc certainly started out being interesting, but now it's just become bloated and confusing. The fact that it wasn't even *hinted* at in Series 7A was a bit of a relief, but still comes off as weak, given that it absolutely dominated the preceding two serials. 

I've never liked Amy and Rory. They were entertaining, at first, but it seemed like Moffat was trying to cram them down our throats at every turn. Amy **LOVES** Rory! Rory **WAITED TWO THOUSAND YEARS** for Amy! I like it when the story is organically, naturally told by the characters, and nothing about Amy Pond seemed natural. (cf ""Asylum of the Daleks"", where they bounce back from the brink of divorce with nary a look back.) 

Nothing about Amy Pond seemed natural, and I'm sure part of that was due to her living near the cracks in time for so long, and her psychological obsession on the Doctor through her childhood, but there was nothing that drew me to her adult character. Nothing that made me want to invest in her, share her triumphs or console her in her falls.

When ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" finished with that sepia-tinted photograph of Amelia, I felt like I had been invited to the going-away party of a friend of a friend, someone I barely knew (and probably wouldn't like if I knew her well). 

I don't like the over-reliance on time travel technobabble. Yes, it's *Doctor Who*, and yes, it's not about the science, but ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" and ""The Wedding of River Song"" came up with all these arbitrary rules about time travel. Fixed points, knowing about fixed points, time can be re-written, this, that, paradox here, paradox there, blah blah blah. You're working with something as non-existent as time travel, trying to define what you can and can't do to the level that Moffat does just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. 

I don't know whether this will hold up in the court of public opinion, but nothing Steven Moffat has done since ""The Pandorica Opens"" has excited me about *Doctor Who* (although I did enjoy ""A Good Man Goes To War""). His writing has a way of introducing a fine novelty, and then running it into the ground with a drill. The complexities of ""Blink"" were subtle, understated, and perfect. Then he took that idea and made it his calling card, so much so that stories *stopped making sense* because hey, look, time travel paradoxes! Why bother with details when you can have characters appearing and disappearing out of their timelines? Why bother wrapping up loose ends when you can write these BIG, EPIC episodes of FEELING and EMOTION where EVERYBODY CRIES, ROSE!?

His characters are shallow and overblown, always with the sexy and the flirting. 
Rory, I suppose, had some good development - starting out hopelessly pining for Amy and then finally marrying her. I guess he was in love with her, but I really wish he had simply grown some balls. Even in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"", he was the one off running errands and getting abducted by Cherubim Angels, while the Doctor and Amy had a picnic in Central Park. Even Mickey Smith walked out on Rose. If Amy seriously suggested that she and Rory enter a polyamorous relationship with the Doctor, I really do think Rory would have gone along with it. 

Steven Moffat is certainly not the first *Doctor Who* executive producer/showrunner whose stories I do not like, but he's right up there.

I've had a hit and run on my car but it's shitty anyway so I don't really mind.  My friend has been punched for no reason by a lout in the SU.


**Is there anywhere in Plymouth you feel safe/secure/comfortable? Why?**

Everywhere really, Plymouth doesn't really have the gang/gun culture of other southern cities like London &amp; Bristol.  The same fears would occur at night that one would expect in other place, maybe less a result of the former.


**Is there anywhere in Plymouth you feel fearful/afraid or uncomfortable due to other people or groups or the fear of crime/harmful experiences? Why?**

If I was around a bunch of drunk Navy guys on shore leave the I'd probably be somewhat ill-at-ease because they seem to have a reputation of starting shit for no reason.  So much so that I've heard they have to wear ID tags that the bouncers can rip off them if they start trouble in a club.


**Do these answers differ depending on whether you are on your own or in a group?**

I'd be less afraid of getting jumped on a night time walk through a dark, quiet, park or alley if I was in a group, in a more chaotic environment I don't think it makes much of a difference.

-  the music wasn't anything great,

- it was way to busy for my taste (and we weren't even in the busy parts)

- if I recall correctly we needed to be there sth like 45 min before the fireworks started at midnight as they closed the gates to the street party at that time,

- last years firework display was kinda short as well (people kept telling me how massive and long it was beforehand so I guess I was particularly let down on that point).

I probably had a really bad experience and it isn't as horrible as I recall it. I just can't say I had a particularly great start into 2012. However, that said, you and your friend might very well enjoy it.

Would I go there again and spend that much money on a Street Party Ticket?

But really what I think of most are the 'Your favorite Doctor' polls, which almost always have McGann and Colin fighting at the bottom with a few percentage points.

On the whole, though, I do wish the love was more evenly spread around. On those same polls, Smith, Tennant, and Tom are in some random order at the top(More times than not, I've noticed UK focused polls tend to lean more towards Smith, Baker, then Tennant, while US focused polls are Tennant, Smith, then Baker), but then after that the percentage points just fall of and you see the rest of the actors fighting for the scraps left over.",0,1353024540,null,0,false,0,c720zqj,t3_138sti,t1_c720zqj,t1_c720rki,null,1430417352,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I agree about the bad sepia fade in Angels Take Manhattan, but I don't mind the technobabble. It doesn't hold up to scrutiny, well...it's not really supposed to hold up to *that* much scrutiny. Not the kind of scrutiny us crazy fans give it. But really, it's not necessary for us to do that anyways. All the technobabble is there for, is to explain away plot details that, really, aren't that important/relevant to the story that's being told. Well exceptions like the Pandorica/Big Bang where it's all about time travel. Angels Take Manhattan was more about Amy and Rory and their parting. So it's perfectly okay if  Moffat whips up some random technobabble so that he can deliver us a story about Amy and Rory and their parting (I thought ATM was just okay).

Honestly, Moffat writes a lot of stories that have crazy technobabble. We may be sick of it now, but years from now in the future when DW is taking a very different course, we'll miss Moffat. We'll say, where has all the time travel timey wimey stuff gone? This is a show about *time travel*, this stuff should be happening all the time. Considering time travel was rarely a plot device in the classic series, we're just making up for lost time.

I don't think Blink was very subtle at all- 10 pretty much shouted out from his DVDs at us and info-dumped us at the end of the episode. It was a very good story though.

And big epic episodes of feeling and emotion are not Moffat exclusive... ick the series 4 finale? Series 3 finale? I think that the time travel details make sense, even if it's clear that Moffat/the Doctor are making up crap as they go along. That's pretty much the method Doctor Who has always run on and that doesn't bug me. In one story, the Doctor said something happened 50 billion years ago (the universe is only 15 billion years old).

Also, I don't think that the sexiness and flirting is a detractor. You can have sex and flirting in a story without it becoming shallow or banal. Obviously there's nothing I can do about the characters. I did wish Rory would get a backbone, and the whole ""we love each other"" is just part of the new generation where love is...well, *romanticized*.

You vote in preference. 

If a party gets 50%+ of the votes, they win that constituency.

If not, we discount everyone who chose the party with the fewest votes, instead add their second choices and now see if we have a winner. No? Same process. 

The most extreme outcome is we have 3 parties left. The smallest of the three gets discount and second (third, fourth, fifth etc) votes are added to the largest two and one of them now must have 50%+.

true,FreePatArthur,eccleston,Eccleston,"&gt;Why bother wrapping up loose ends when you can write these BIG, EPIC episodes of FEELING and EMOTION where EVERYBODY CRIES, ROSE!?

That has been a staple of all the writers of the new series, though. At first, I was excited to see a doctor that wasn't as emotional and brooding as Ten was, because it got a bit old to me after a bit. But these big, emotional endings came back and it is just so trite in TV writing in general, that I just skip them after the first time through the episode/season/series/whatever.

The strong point of Moffat's, in my eyes, are the one-off episodes. I thought Dinosaurs on a Spaceship was so fun. I might be a bit biased because of the whole Mitchell and Webb as robots thing, but I really enjoyed watching the way the Doctor impacted Brian. That was Rory's dad's name, right? Either way, the episodes that feed less into the seasonal arc are always my favorites of his. 

I am not positive Amy was a bad character as much as she might have just been a bad person. And if the case is that she was a bad person, the writing was done perfect for her because she was truly heinous on a human level. 

As far as the ""science"" part of it all, I think it is half the reason I started watching the show to begin with. I could see that getting in the way for some, but I just love the fake little science packets with timey bows for everyone to think about. 

Thank you for taking the time to elaborate.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I believe the concept of libertarianism is fundamentally at odds with socialism.

You can believe what you like, but socialists _invented_ libertarianism.  You guys on the American right only discovered it in the 1960/70s or so!

&gt;The idea they are compatible belongs in the 19th Century before it was found that capitalism isn't imposed on society by a minority of wealthy individuals but is a natural state of human societies

Where do you get this from?  Capitalism is a tiny blip in the history of humanity, for 97% of our history we've not lived under the yoke of capitalism (many other yokes of course...).  Capitalism is dominant now, but it's caused huge problems in the few hundred years we've been forced to endure it.

&gt;I know a Lithuanian farmer's son. Under the soviets farmland was divided out equally among families in the area. His grandfather rented land from a number of families, and farmed it as if it was one farm (and for profit). He was sent to a labour camp for it.

Horrible.  Presumably this was under State capitalism? Communism (which I'm not a supporter of by the way), _doesn't have a State_ to do this kind of shit.

&gt;People will naturally buy and sell things for profit. People will naturally pay others for labour, and then sell that product of that labour for profit. People will naturally labour in return for a wage, even though they know it will turn a profit for someone else.

Naturally buy and sell things, for sure, but that's called trade, not capitalism, capitalism has nothing whatsoever to do with trade.  And, for your information, for much of human history trade had little to do with ""profits"" particularly - many human societies were gift economies, credit economies etc.  Barter was largely a notion modern economists and historians imposed on previous times because they didn't understand them.  Anthropologists vehemently disagree.

Generally, saying something is ""natural"" or ""human nature"" sets of my bullshit detectors good and loud.

&gt;If people have the freedom of voluntary association, capitalism will re-establish itself.

Freedom and voluntary are not the kind of words I associate with capitalism which is heavily dependant on a State to enforce it.

&gt;To protect a socialist economy a state must use coercion to deny a human right. This is incompatible with libertarianism.

Irony or what?  I don't believe in a State, so I'll tell you what, we'll get rid of the State, at a time and place of my choosing and we'll see hey?

&gt;Libertarian socialism is a concept that in practice would prove unstable and devolve into either authoritarian socialism or libertarian capitalism.

Nonsense, the few experiments with libertarian socialism to date have all had to be destroyed by Statists of one persuasion or another, because people don't go back willingly.  Mostly capitalists.  And as for ""libertarian capitalism"", where in the world can I find this? I think you're imagining things.  D you believe in fairies too?

I judge them by their actions, not what might have been going on in their heads, they killed millions of leftists and put tens of thousands more in work ad death camps for fuck sake, they even developed one of their little stars for it for leftists to wear!!  You people drink the hard right American koolaid too much.  They're trying to reinvent history and you guys don't even notice.  They hated the Jews because they associated Jews with the communist/socialist ""menace"" to German society.  If the fascists hadn't taken power, Germany would likely have gone commie.

&gt;They did murder large numbers of unionists and Communists that disagreed with them, but that is hardly unique to their ideology or socialism.  Their socialism just happened to exclude any non aryan people or those that disagreed with them.

When did they go radically democratic and have decision-making from below?

You're right though, Carroll most likely to go to (I sometimes forget he's still with the club).  Downing probably next in line, followed by Henderson (although I think he could actually fit into the squad and has been given an unfair go by fans).

But yes, Joe Cole is simply dead weight.  We need to get him out at any cost really.  Also I don't really trust Ian Ayre when it comes to signings.  This mistrust has very little real evidence behind it and is probably unfounded.",0,1353039175,null,0,false,0,c724vng,t3_137edr,t1_c724vng,t1_c71tdik,null,1430419260,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Also two points:
1) the previous system provided more governance, with a mix of politicians from different parties and also magistrates and maybe a lay member; much more than one elected commissioner; and

2) policing in my opinion shouldn't be populist . What's good regarding policing won't necessarily win you votes.   As a journalist on BBC reported:

""If I were standing, I'd pledge to clean up the dog poo and Taser groups of three or more teenagers on sight,"" quipped the world-weary member of a police authority I met at a conference.

""I'd be a shoo-in. They'd all vote for me because these elections are about what's popular - not necessarily what is right.""

Now, I hold my hand up and admit that I appear to have overstated the ease with which the authorities can reveal a voter's identity (a court order is required, for the combat of voter fraud, and to date, this has apparently never happened). There is a lot more documentation available now than the last time I checked, several years ago. 
Also, it was very late when I wrote that reply. 

But the fact is that the mechanism to track your vote is in place and always has been. 

I don't believe that the government would be able to track voters for making offensive comments - the courts would refuse. But I bet they would like to, given their zeal to convict people for making offensive jokes/comments etc on social media.

'Two Hearts (Zwei Hertzen)'
http://lyricstranslate.com
Two hearts beat in your chest
You know it already long since
You have loved and hated yourself
You have laughed and cried at the same time
Either forwards or backwards
Either belief or luck
Either everything or nothing
Nobody decides for you

Two hearts beat in your chest
Two hearts but not within the same rhythm
Two hearts, two hearts
You knew it
Yes you knew it

One heart full of fear and one full of courage
One heart is tender, one full of rage
One is young and one is old
Dumb and wise
Hot and cold
One is too quiet, one too loud
One heart hesitates, one does dares
Between truth or dare
One heart stays hard and one breaks apart

Love that album too by the way. Smashing Pumpkins are totally my 90's band.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties#The_second_study_.282006.29

A more conservative source: 

http://www.iraqbodycount.org/

Adding to this the brutal sanctions imposed between the first Iraq war and the second were responsible for 500,000 children's deaths. These sanctions were the responsibility of the US and UK. When questioned about it, Madeleine Albright doesn't even try to deny it. This is a famous interview, if you have any interest in global politics you wuld have come across it: 

http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084

So if I'm being very optimistic, the US and UK have responsibility for the unnecessary deaths of at least 700,000 Iraqis since the war over Kuwait. 

Anyway, I'm sure you're busy doing PR for Blair to do your own research but whether or not Blair broke a law, he instigated a war of aggression in cahoots with Bush, he defied international consensus and lied to his electorate and fellow politicians in order to mount an unprovoked invasion.

&gt;you guys

No idea who you think I am or where you think Im from or even where you think I have supported ANY of the ideologies we have been talking about but you are wrong. 

You seem to be confusing socialism with liberalism and forgetting that socialism on its own is completely concerned with equality, usually at the expense of freedom, and therefore can sit alongside totalitarian and fascist systems very easily. (My criticism of Libertarianism would be the reverse of this, freedom without equality is equally pointless)

&gt;Oh Jesus, if it wasn't so sad, I'd laugh...

Yes it is sad and is only one example of supposedly Socialist regimes killing people they disagree with and leftists. Spanish and Russian Socialists murdered Anarchists, Stalin killed just about anyone with a different point of view and there are countless African and other Socialist despots like Mugabe who have blood on their hands.

I never said that the Nazis were pure Socialists but it is undeniable that they did have many points of view that conflict with Capitalism as Socialism was a part of their ideology.

&gt;When did they go radically democratic and have decision-making from below?

When has any supposedly Socialist country? Cuba? Russia? Zimbabwe? North Korea? China? Libia? 

This is the problem with Socialism on its own. The preoccupation with absolute equality has led time and time again to totalitarianism due to a lack of focus on freedom. 
The only time I can see Socialist principles in action and working well are when they are met EQUALLY with Anarchism or libertarianism. 

My main point though is that although Fascism and Capitalism (and American Libertarianism) are terrible, they are not the same and can exist separately.

Any radio services,

News 

Current Affairs

It's Documentary output is far inferior to the BBC's

It's department is smaller and offers far less investment in local films than BBC Film.

The BBC publishing arm creates fantastic books to accompany fantastic it documentary series 

The BBC own either the best or 2nd best travel guide series (Lonely Planet)

The BBC has a mandate to cater for viewers which are not catered   for by other channels so when Sky cash in on the success of BBC4 by creating Sky Atlantic and outbidding for every show shown on HBO AMC &amp; Showtime The BBC responded not by competing with Sky for the american shows but finding fantastic high-end dramas from europe to replace them - no other channel/network at the time would of built its schedule around a Norwegian police drama like BBC4 did 2 years ago. 

The BBC is not responsible for creating shows such as G String Divas, Real Sex and Taxicab Confessions.

HBO isn't the most well known and internationally respected broadcaster in the world, the BBC is.

Also to get HBO you have to pay about $12 a month on top of your cable package - The BBC does everything it does for a licence fee of about £12 a month  plus profits from its commercial arms such as publishing and BBC worldwide - which are only successful because they are selling fanatic product created by BBC or linked to one of the BBC's programmes.

When you tot it all up, HBO, which is a great broadcaster producing many of my favourite shows over the last 15 years, begins to look a bit like a rip off when you compare it to what you get from the BBC for just 3 pounds more a month.

It came out 5 years ago which was about the time when more than 50% of the population had access to broadband - I know I only had broadband since 2003 and it was considered rather new and exciting then. The first public tests for the iplayer were in fact a few years earlier in 2004 but the main complaint users had was time taken to load and buffering of the videos.

It beat ITV player to market by over a year (ch4 did quickly launch a basic 4OD between the BBC's first public tests and the the first stable release of iplayer).

It still wipes the floor with ITVplayer and 4OD in terms of quality of the application/site.

Also the BBC does not sell the rights to BBC Worldwide - BBC Worldwide are given the rights for a foreign markets which haven't been pre sold or determined by contract. The UK rights, if its a 100% BBC production are always in the hands of the BBC. For most productions the rights a split between the BBC and the production company which means after a given period the BBC is still the only channel that can show the programme but have to pay the production company royalties for each screening (this is the same reason why old films are shown on Ch4, film4 and more4 in quick succession - get the most from the option when you have it).

It's the 1970's, you are a super star DJ. Worshipped by millions of adoring female fans. Each day you have a string of willing groupies back to your studio for some special one on one microphone action. 

A 17 year old fan comes in and is flirting heavily, you invite her back to your studio and try your best moves, hand on leg and then up the skirt. 

Girl screams stop, you stop. She leaves the studio and you are left wondering what happened there. 

Next day, a new groupie comes to see you. A bit more cautious this time you start your moves again. Score. Yesterdays girl is forgotten about. 

35 years later you are arrested for putting your hands up the skirt of someone you can't even remember. 

Personally, the groupie type world is all very seedy and not something I'd want to be associated with. But these guys were the mega stars of the day (like Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones) and where there are groupies, there will be seedy men happy to be with them. In the spirit of equality, I think the groupies are just as sad and seedy as the men that are interested in them. 

The above of course is all speculation. But so are all the claims of he must be guilty of assault. We don't have all the facts. I just think we should be sceptical until more comes out. In the UK the Sunday Tabloid market has created a flavour of celebrity happy to sell their soul to be a part of a juicy and lucrative story.

*Tax is for little people*
 
AS PARLIAMENT finally gets wise to multinationals that operate lucratively in the UK but don't pay commensurate taxes — Starbucks, Google et al — there are firms over which the government could exert rather more leverage if it wanted to.

As Eye 1324 reported shortly before the Starbucks scandal erupted, one of the government's largest IT suppliers, Accenture, uses offshore arrangements to convert £2bn of income into a tax bill of less than £3m. But it is not alone.

An even larger supplier, IBM, receives around £400m a year from UK taxpayers and, alongside Accenture, is a lead provider on the universal credits programme. In four years up to 2011 it paid just £30m corporation tax on more than £15bn income and more than £1bn of pre-tax profit. The derisory bill is accounted for by low profit margins, less than half the multinational's overall worldwide profit rate and accounted for by the standard offshore transactions (IBM, like Google, Apple and others, is an avid user of Ireland's fiscal charms), plus the adroit use of generous tax incentives for research and development spending and the payment of staff in share options.

Not much more tax payment is in evidence from the big IT suppliers to HM Revenue &amp; Customs itself. The Aspire consortium, paid around £800m a year by the taxman, comprises Japanese firm Fujitsu and French multinational Capgemini. In the last four years Fujitsu has paid £10m tax on its profits, and then not all in the UK, despite a £9bn turnover in the period. To be fair to the company, however, it has lost money in the UK largely through pisspoor performance such as its screw-up on the NHS's national IT programme (Eyes passim).

Capgemini, which doesn't disclose details of actual payments, shows tax credits in recent years, indicating no tax payments at all. Their absence is accounted for, again, by profit margins way below the group's worldwide performance and tax relief for pensions costs and research spending.

The government's main IT supplier, HP Enterprise Service UK Limited (which acquired EDS in 2008) earns more than £1.5bn a year from taxpayers but is remarkably shy about its tax payments. It too shows lower margins in the UK than earned worldwide by HP which employs a variety of offshore techniques, outlined in a US Senate report in September. The UK company's accounts show that at the end of 2011 it stood to pay £20m in corporation tax, while at the same point the previous year it was expecting a £13.5m repayment, but the company refused to tell the Eye what its overall contributions were.

Across the board the position is clear enough. The companies to which British taxpayers hand over billions every year for questionable IT services are paying peanuts to the government in tax on their ample profits.",0,1353070589,null,0,false,0,c729e8s,t3_13aoca,t1_c729e8s,t3_13aoca,null,1430421533,4,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,4

*They're a liability*

PRIVATE EYE has examined some of the thousands of Ukrainian-controlled ""limited liability partnerships"" created under British company law and subject to near non-existent regulation, and found some very dubious operations indeed.

One partnership set up under the ownership of Ireland &amp; Overseas Acquisittons Ltd and Milltown Corporate Services Ltd the British Virgin Islands companies favoured by senior Ukrainian political and business figures and their Latvian stooge directors (see last Eye), is Marine Energy Trading Company LLP (""Metco"").

Metco sailed into view when Wikileaks cables revealed that in 2008 the US Navy had captured a ship aled the MV Edna, chartered by Mdco. She had been hijacked by Somali posies off the Horn of Africa and contained a dead Russian captain
ends cargo of Ukrainian tanks and artris destined for Southern Sudan.

The Americans had intercepted a serious attempt to evade intematmnal sanctions — quite a ruse for an LIP registered to a trading estate in Fareham, Hampshire, having been set up by minor West End law firm Pearson Lowe in 2007.

Metco didn't last long Illled accounts showing modest ""commission"" income of around £20,000 a year before the BVI companies transferred their interests to a couple of Panamanian companies, which dissolved it in 2010.

At least 700 similar LLPs are hosted by Company Formations Ltd in Cardiff, run by local businessman Phil Williams from a vacated kitchen shop on Whitchurch Street, the end of terrace property grandiosely earned ""Enterprise House"" Pot official pumoses but with no sign of this or any other LLP at the empty premises.
 
When Eye hacks visited, one letter on the doormat was visible through the glass, addressed to a firm called Datlux LLP and evidently dispatched from the Kiev branch of ING bank. This LLP (also owned by Milltown Corporate Services Ltd and Ireland &amp; Overseas Acquisitions Ltd before being passed a few weeks ago to a couple of Marshall Islands-registered companies) describes its business as a ""trade agent for frozen fish and seafood"". There is evidence of involvement in only one ""seafood"" shipment, in 2011, by the LIP which claims a trading address in a small town in Oregon, 5,000 miles from its Cardiff registered office.

The biggest earner (officially) registered at Williams' empty shop is Trentmile LLP, owned by more opaque offshore companies, one in the Seychelles, the other now M Dominica. It sells ""oil products and associated services"", but with uncertain results. In Companies House filings it first declared itself dormant until April 2011 with no assets or income, then submitted ""replacement"" accounts showing income of £2.3m by that date. It subsequently submitted later accounts, up to December 2011, suggesting that income in the ear/ier pet od was £1.7m. None of which seems to have overly concerned it bankers, Credit Suisse in Zurich, nor the and it now requires since its turnover has to £7m, Malone's in County Wicklow, Ireland.

As the last Eye noted, Irish businessmen are the Ukrainians' conduit into the UK company system, with Williams' outfit doing the paperwork. He told the Eye: ""I do set them up, yep, it is part of the business that we de; but he admitted that ""I don't know who ultimately owns them"". He subsequently claimed his firrn ""has not formed any companies"", and that his task ""involves very simply, the forwarding of mail unopened to a company based in Dublin whh whom we have conducted business for many years and have never had reason to doubt their credentials"". Asked about money laundering, Williams replied that the It agents ""have [money laundering] requirements"".

Thus Britain remains open for dodgy business, seeing up opaque corporate vehicles for offshore owners with dubious connections. No questions asked.

I had my skull busted open as a consequence of being a ""Filthy faggot"", so I'm not exactly inclined to be handing out ""Free passes"" to people.

I also have no interest in watching anything Stern espouses.

The issue at hand, is if this individual posted comments that necessitated the start of a disciplinary procedure where he works, and subsequent action. Here's an overview of what he did:

&gt;On the evening of Monday 14 February Mr Smith posted:

&gt; “I don’t understand why people who have no faith and don’t believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church.


&gt;“The Bible is quite specific that marriage is for men and women. If the state wants to offer civil marriage to the same sex then that is up to the state; but the state shouldn’t impose its rules on places of faith and conscience.”

I personally fail to see how the above is cause for a man to be demoted from his position. It's not like the more recent example of a marriage / relationship councillor who argued that he couldn't ""in good faith"" offer advice to a same sex couple.

 In that instance the person could clearly be demonstrated as failing to adhere to a level of professional standards, and could be shown to be discriminating against people.

Mr Smith, on the other hand, posted - in his own time, using his own equipment - a status to a private Facebook page in which he expressed dismay at the notion of religious organisations being forced to offer religious ceremonies to same sex couples.

What he said, wasn't in breach of the terms of his employment. He expressed his personal opinion on a matter that as a practising Christian is important to him. He did so, in his own spare time, using his own equipment, to a private Facebook account that wasn't accessible to the public.

They were mis-guided, and ill-informed [as were his comments outside Court today.] but crucially they didn't breach his contract.

They also weren't homophobic. As SteveD88 posted [http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/13an9k/man_wins_case_over_gay_marriage_facebook_post/c729pih] it's quite possible to be against gay marriage, and yet not be homophobic.

Is Mr. Smith homophobic? I don't know. Nor care, for that matter. But his comments - posted privately, and in reference to the practice of the Church of England, were not.

The racism angle you're commenting on isn't valid. It's illegal to discriminate against people based on their religion. Rightly so.

It's also illegal to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. Had Mr. Smith done that - by posting something that was clearly homophobic? He'd have been in breach of his contract, and would have lost his court appeal today.

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt; Communism (which I'm not a supporter of by the way), doesn't have a State to do this kind of shit.

Which is precisely why a stateless (or small state) society would be capitalist. Preventing private ownership requires a body to enforce the ban. This is why ""the few experiments with libertarian socialism to date have all had to be destroyed by Statists"", because socialism requires coercion to prevent people from accumulating wealth and entering into contracts that constitute capitalism. 

If the socialist society opts for coercion, it's not libertarian, if it opts for no coercion then it will eventually cease being socialist.

If people are free to set up and invest in private enterprises then those that are successful will begin to accumulate wealth, those making good investments will see their wealth grow faster than the economy. Over time these people will gain a greater share of the economy and consequently it will eventually resemble our own economy's mix of socially and privately owned organisations.

I'm not on the american right, and I fall far short of libertarian.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Which is precisely why a stateless (or small state) society would be capitalist. Preventing private ownership requires a body to enforce the ban.

When capitalists (principally US style Libertarian ""minarchists"") talk about a ""small State society"", it's interesting that the bits they want to keep are mostly the bits engaged in repression - police, courts, prisons.  I wonder why?  Perhaps because private property requires a State to enforce?

&gt;This is why ""the few experiments with libertarian socialism to date have all had to be destroyed by Statists"", because socialism requires coercion to prevent people from accumulating wealth and entering into contracts that constitute capitalism. 

There have been lots of (admittedly small scale) experiments with libertarian socialism, several of which are ongoing.  The two or three large ones have been destroyed by Statist forces, it's true, and anarchists would do well to realise and learn from this.  However, it's worth noting that in both major cases, they were built up during times of bloody civil war, which - though not necessarily surprising, is an important factor, and they were knocked down by supposed allies in ""surprise"" attacks.  In fact, the anarchists in anarchist Ukraine had already defeated the capitalist invaders from Britain, America, etc. before the Bolsheviks turned on them.

&gt;If the socialist society opts for coercion, it's not libertarian, if it opts for no coercion then it will eventually cease being socialist.

And yet it is capitalism which operates a day-to-day system of coercion across the world, backed by a military-industrial-prison system of unparalleled size and violence in the history of humanity.",0,1353077317,null,0,false,0,c72aj7g,t3_138cg6,t1_c72aj7g,t1_c729zln,null,1430422078,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To draw attention from Chang to the bigger issue - this is another example of a misstep by Henry and Warner. Despite all the talk of 'year zero' and 'we're still learning', it's now been two years since the club was bought by FSG. During this period, the club has redirected focus via multiple debacles towards a youth orientated, 'money-ball' directive. The underlying theme seems to be that just through running the club more intelligently, we can succeed without investment or large wage bills or big names signings/managers.  Despite talking a postive game, nothing they have achieved gives me confidence that these owners truly have the capacity to run Liverpool at a higher level than it previously was, or better than our competitors. 

From Comolli and Carroll, to the way Dalglish and Clarke were treated, to the farcical documentary and the transfer deadline debacle, the view from inside the UK and inside Liverpool towards the owners is becoming increasingly cynical. The continued lack of a representative let alone the owners themselves in Liverpool continues to be troubling. We're still some distance from FSG being viewed like Hicks and Gillett, but there's little denying that the general consensus has moved from seeing Henry and Warner as potential saviours, to just another foreign owner looking to fatten a prized sow to be sold at market after the new tv deal is sorted. How the owners respond to the winter transfer window, with the deficincies in the squad so obvious, and also how they respond to the next 'crisis' (whatever it may be) will be pivotal to whether they'll continue to have the support (or at least the silence) of the fans.",0,1353081239,null,0,false,0,c72bgoc,t3_13arvn,t1_c72bgoc,t3_13arvn,null,1430422507,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;If FSG were serious about making a significant addition to the club we would never have been chasing Dempsey to begin with, let alone haggling over nickles and dimes at the end of the deal.

Perhaps it was a matter of availability at that time, perhaps teams are reluctant to make big moves at a time of the year when hope springs eternal.

But, I think you're right, perhaps FSG *did* hesitate in the summer and they wanted to see if it could be done with these youngsters and some of these veterans and newcomers.

But now it's clear that it's only 1/2 working and our scoring woes are clear to everyone. FSG *has* to see this and act accordingly.
