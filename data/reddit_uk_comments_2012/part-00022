No one was fighting over the theological differences between Protestantism and Catholicism, and it is unlikely that many people during the Troubles (or even today) would have been able to exhaustively list what  these differences actually were/are.

These grievances in turn however, *were* the legacy of a time in which religion and religious identity was of much greater importance. It was the religious divide which prevented the settlers and the natives from merging together to form a single nation and which motivated the settler oppression of the native population. By the time of the Troubles, in the late 1960's however, the societal division had come to be expressed in the more modern, secular terms of nationality, with Catholics primarily identifying as ""Irish"" and Protestants as ""British"".

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"&gt;Your posts have had the same level of figures to back them up. 

You made a statement (""it's pretty clear there are millions of unemployed people claiming benefits who have no intention of working"") with no evidence to back it up.  I ask you for evidence and you respond by changing your opinion (""It may not be millions of people, but it's definitely no small number""), still with no corroborating evidence.  You're now suggesting that the burden of responsibility lies with me to prove you wrong, despite the fact that you've provided no evidence.  Hmmm.

&gt;I don't know why you assume I have a database of information for every topic.

This goes back to my Harlan Ellison quote.  If you're going to argue a point, you really need to have some data to back it up, or you'll be seen as arguing from a position of ignorance and that's how people can end up looking stupid.

&gt;If you care so much about actually (sic) numbers you should do a survey.

Yeah, it's a bit rubbish caring about the actual statistics isn't it?  Much better to rely on pre-conceived notions and bias.  This is a subject I'm interested in so I've already looked at the data published by the ONS.  I urge you to look at that data yourself so you can, at least, be arguing from a position of knowledge.  Here, I'll even give you a link: [ONS Labour Market Bulletin, February 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-222474)

&gt;getting people to work in the public sector for very little money benefits society more than paying someone a decent wage. You see, the less it costs us the better.

By that rationale, we should remove the National Minimum Wage presumably?  After all, it would cost us less.  Even better, we sack a load of people, making them unemployed, then hire them back to do the same job for JSA.  Everyone's a winner!  Except for the poor bastards actually doing a full day's work for far less than minimum wage.  Fuck 'em - they're lazy.  Why on Earth do they deserve to earn ""a decent wage""?

&gt;Nice logical fallacy.

I'm not sure that phrase means what you think it means.  You might want to look into it.

&gt;I don't see any bias in my arguments. 

This is a very sad thing to read.  You've arrived at a position without any corroborating evidence, you've flip-flopped on your views (first it was ""millions"", then ""may not be millions""), and you've flitted from point to point like a butterfly, failing to engage properly with most of those points on the way.  And yet you don't see any bias in your arguments?

&gt;You however do seem to have a very strong bias in favour of JSA claimants.

Not really.  I've worked my entire life and have never claimed a single benefit (JSA, Child Benefit, Working Family Tax Credit, etc).  This is because I've been extremely fortunate and I never, ever forget that.  I'm completely aware of the fact that life is rarely simple and lady luck can fuck people over in a heartbeat, without warning.  Whilst there will always be a small core of people who will screw over any system to their own advantage, the majority are folks who find themselves unemployed, do not want to be in that position but, while they are, we are duty bound to help them, as fellow human beings.

&gt;You sound like someone who reads the Guardian, you probably think anyone who doesn't agree with you must be ignorant or ill-informed.

It may be that lower performing schools have tended to want to become academies in order to attain better funding and thus gain better results over time. Higher performing schools may tend to think that they are fine the way they are and to go through the hassle will take focus away from what they're doing right.

On the idea of improving standards, it hasn't been very long since schools have become academies, so it may be that more time is needed for the funding to kick in (5 years, in fact, if you're wanting decent data from year 7 to year 11).

All in all, let's not jump on the ""This newspaper says something about statistics, so it must be correct"".

true,douchebag_karren,rose,Rose,"I respectfully disagree. I love Rose Tyler, far more than Martha, and just a baby bit more than Donna (I'm not past the 10th doctor yet). 

A lot of people forget that Rose was only 19 when she joined up with the Doctor, while Martha was in her early twenties and Donna, I would say later twenties. Rose was young and inexperienced, but she loved traveling, and loved seeing all the different things, and that was what the show needed to get a new audience in, a young audience that didn't know the Doctor and didn't know how he operated. 

On to your point about uslessness.... I don't know which episodes your referring to, but Rose did a lot of shit. She talks the Dalek into killing itself. She kills the guy who has Satan in him in The Satan Pit- thus saving everyone ever. She keeps the dimension hole open long enough to get everything back there in Doomsday. She does get Queen Victoria to say ""I am not amused"" (sorry had to throw that one in there). She attempts to take on the Sycorax while the Doctor is comotose, and stalls long enough to get him to help. And last but certanly not least she takes the Time Vortex into her (pretty much knowing that without a miracle, this will most likely kill her) Saves the Doctor makes Jack immortal, and destroy's the Daleks, all the while spreading the words Bad Wolf through out space and time just so she knows that an ""ordinary human"" can do extraordinary things. She does these things to save the world and the universe and the doctor. 

Yes the Doctor has to save her in many episodes, but he also has to save Donna and Martha in a lot of episodes too... by my count Rose saves the world/universe three times (Bad Wolf, Satan Pit, Doomsday). Martha only saves the world once (Last of the Time Lords) and Donna only once (Journey's End) or twice if you consider the events of Turn Left to be saving the world, although you could link that to Journey's End. and If you do consider the events of Turn Left, You could also count that as a Save the Day for Rose, because without Rose, Donna would have never gotten back to the Doctor. 

Now, to Rose's qualities. 

She's brave, she takes on Dalek's and the time vortex, crawls through tunnles in the impossible planet on the off chance that they can make it to the other part of the ship in time. She crosses dimensions to get back to him and to warn him of what is coming. She investigates on her own, noticing the link to the Televisions in The Idiot's lantern, long before the Doctor does.

She has compassion and morals- she argues against the slavery of the Ood long before Donna comes around, she doesn't accept it as alright. ""Since when have humans needed slaves?"" She's against Gwendolyn from opening up the rift in Cardiff. 

She has Drive. The woman looked into the Time Vortex to save the Doctor and to save Earth, thousands of years in the future. She was going to get sucked into the void in order to save the world from the Daleks and the Cybermen, she crossed universes to get back to the Doctor. 

Sure, Rose caused a few problems, but so did Martha and So did Donna and so did all the one off companions. 

I guess you had a problem with her laughing all the time, but I simply saw that as optimism in the face of a bleak darkness. The Optimism that as long as the Doctor was around there was hope. 

In conclusion, Yes, people like Rose Tyler. I love Rose Tyler. I like her better than Martha and Donna, she was young and in love and brave, and she didn't let anything get between her and the Doctor.

Shit like ""oh it was the robot"", I mean *what the fuck*. And ... agh. So much of it, what the fuck. 

And then there's all the shit about River Song. All the astronaut suit? None of it mattered, it could have been anyone, since she had no control, but no, it HAD to be River ""because teh dramas"", which in part only end up in the Drama because River is the biggest, dumbest psychopath the series has EVER HAD, and not in a cute or heart-moving way, in a ""and people think *the Doctor* is a bad person?!"" kind of way. 

The whole arc has been kind of like the Doctor and River, in a way: we meet her once and she's awesome, but as time goes on it gets worse and worse and makes less and less sense, because it's so poorly handled except for a few tiny moments here and there. Like something was really good, and then slips away a bit more each time you encounter it. 

Oh yeah, and in the end, the whole dang season barely matters. ""omg the doctor dies!"" ""omg what happened? It's this big mystery!"" ""Oh wait no, it wasn't the doctor, whatever.""

I've had similar problems, I came back to the UK from working overseas during the recession, and I applied for tons of jobs but barely had any responses. In the end I decided to go on a work-course thing offered by my university, which paid petrol expenses in line with the DWP guidelines to allow people to continue to collect benefits. It was basically set up specifically to work hand in hand with them.

First person said no, if I was going to be getting expenses, I couldn't get JSA.
Second person said no, you can only do it if it's charity work (it's not a charity).
Third person said yes, but you need to fill in a bunch of forms, and give them a signed letter.

Filled in all the forms, obtained a signed letter from the university work course, wrote a cover note etc. and gave it to the job center who put it in an envelope and posted it to the correct place.

A week later, heard nothing. Phoned them. They'll call me back. Didn't call back. Next day, phoned again, they'll call me back. Didn't phone back. Next day, phoned them, ranted and refused to let them call me back. Eventually they said sorry, we received nothing from you. (Sounded like they thought I was lying).

Back to the job center. Filled in everything again. Couldn't get another letter, so wrote explaining how since they lost the first one, they'd have to contact the university themselves to get one.

They still did nothing. I ended up just going on the course anyway, and taking tuesday mornings off to go to the job center to claim.

Then I got an interview at the other side of the country. However, it was on a tuesday. I explained the situation, that I had an interview on my sign in day. They said if I don't come in, I don't get benefits for those 2 weeks. I explained that this was a promising interview. They said no. I argued further. Someone else came, and explained I could file for a 'looking for work' scheme where you can go to another city and look for work there, negating the need to come in for benefits.

Filled in all the forms, etc. and was told to go to the job center in the city I was searching, and give them the forms.

Rocked up to the job center there - 'Sorry, you need an appointment'

Me 'What, I was told to just show up and give you these forms, you just have to sign to say I came to the city to look for work'

'Sorry, you should have made an appointment'

5 minutes of banter, I refuse to budge

Why the proposed system is a terrible idea: The premise that 1 individual directly elected can manage a constabulary more competently that approximately 12 individuals from mixed backgrounds is flawed. Not only this, but it will in effect politicize policing. Furthermore, Local Authorities are already democratic, as they contain elected officials (councillors).

Out of interest, what do you think is a fair take home (not a pre-tax figure) salary for a senior doctor?  That's a perfectly reasonable debate and I agree that no-one will end up ""on the breadline"" if the changes go through.  Their are many ways of not being on the breadline though and if you are an exceptional individual, choosing to work in the public sector probably already means less life time earnings than pursuing a career in the private sector.  This move makes the public sector less attractive and as a result will reduce the quality of people you bring into the profession while losing a lot of good will and commitment to the NHS from current employees in the process.

With regards to GP pay, I agree some GPs earn a lot of money, because of the way a percentage of their pay is linked to the performance of their whole practice in health outcomes, rather than the hours they spend seeing patients.  GPs are effectively small businesses, which the government probably underestimated the efficiency of.  I don't see how that justifies taxing all NHS workers.

I've lived round there for over ten years, and it's always been an institution - they used to have a licence for off-sales until midnight, which was a life saver on many occasions - and I liked the restaurant downstairs. The menu didn't change very often, but it was convenient and well priced, with a friendly and unpretentious atmosphere - unlike its next door neighbour.

I don't suppose your saw Peckhams' Christmas window display? It was brilliant - really weird Alice in Wonderland stuff. I took this picture with my phone, but I wish I could've got the whole window: http://www.flickr.com/photos/eh10/6601352621/in/photostream/lightbox/

At this stage, yes. In fact, it's *lazy* trolling.

&gt;Are you joking ? 

No, but I think you are. I gave several examples, from my own experience and that of others, as well as the show itself (which doesn't show much that would surprise anyone with previous experience). You have provided nothing to the contrary, usually a sign of trolling.

&gt;So you are again pointing out your incapacity to provide any proof it seem ?

No - your lack of ability to confirm or refute. Also known as 'trolling'.

Why, are you not going to do any reading of your own on that too? Or shall we go back to the alligator? Repeated pointless analogy - also known as trolling.

No, I'd take others' comments as a sign that I might need to read up more, rather than expecting each of them to do it for me. To do otherwise about a commonly known and experienced subject could be considered trolling.

&gt;Why do you think that I expected to learn anything about gypsies from you by the way ?

I expect people to generally learn for themselves when faced with a subject they ask ignorant question about. Unless, of course, they have no real intention of doing so because they're trolling.

&gt;Did you look at the definition of the word fallacy and fallacious ? 

Did you do any reading of your own? Apparently not. Too busy trolling, I expect.

&gt;If not, dont you think you might have learn something from those ?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;if you reread all our exchanges you will clearly see that I never intended nor tried to discuss the gypsies question with you.

Making your contributions to the entire thread pointless. Also know as trolling. Hence I saw no need to provide you with any information via links at all, despite it's availability.

&gt;My source of interest in this discussion was to discover the logic (lack of) behind your perception that the opinion that you had formed about gypsies had any value.

Which you still haven't discovered, because you've contributed nothing to it (which you need to do to find out more - we're not at college). For example, I suggested several avenues you could explore to figure that out quite easily - but you wanted me to do that for you as well, and trolling rarely generates a decent conversation; you apparently haven't figured this out either.

&gt;Said otherwise, i have never been interested in proving your claim being wrong or trying to get any information about gypsies

So to summarise, you were trolling.

&gt;That is why I provided those link, they are relevant as they would help you understand what exactly i was questioning (which is not your opinion on gypsies as i said 10 times).

Yeah, annoying when someone wants to actually talk about the subject at hand, isn't it?

&gt;(which is not your opinion on gypsies as i said 10 times).

Ignoring the subject in a thread doesn't make it go away. And it's not my opinion, if you'd comprehended my (or many of the other) comments in this thread. Making assertions like this which openly ignore previous comments is generally known as trolling.

&gt;Anyway, did you read those link i provided ?

You mean in the same manner as the reading you didn't do? Oh, I see, you're still hijacking. Good luck with that.

&gt;Or do you think that they were not relevant and just an attempt at trolling ?

They *were* irrelevant, and they were indeed an attempt at trolling. If you want to talk about research methods, start your own thread - don't hijack someone else's and then act confused when people refuse to follow your lead in an one-sided exchange where you ignore the subject because you just want to talk about something else. People might think you were trolling (and they'd be right).

&gt;Note that the topic of our discussion has now shifted

It has? There you go again. Or do you mean in terms of my not responding seriously until you provide some backup of your own on a subject you either know nothing about of have no experience of? That's not topic-shifting - that's topic-ending. Or more accurately, topic-trolling :-)

&gt;from me trying to blindly understand your logical reasoning and your own perception of it 

You weren't trying to understand - you'd have done some reading if that was your intention.

&gt;me trying to provide some food for thought (hence the apparition of links).

Providing links on a seperate subject after repeatedly failing to provide any links about the subject = not going to get you very far. I gave you plenty of food for thought/ sources/ examples - on the subject at hand (as have many others in this thread); if you'd provided a link (for example) that suggested crime rates were unaffected by traveller presence, I'd have provided links to dispute this - but you didn't. You'd rather troll instead.

&gt;If you are not interested in this, feel free to say it.

It took you that long to figure this out?

This is largely because what the public wants makes no sense.

Near zero chance of randomly coming across a crime and not much evidence of crime deterrence. Better they can quickly react to incidents across a far wider area.

An experienced police commander knows this (and a million and one other gems of experience), an elected one won't and even if they do will still be inclined to misappropriate resources to the naive whim of lay voters.

The UK is a full member of the EU since 1973, with representation in the council and parliament. It has opted out of some specific agreements such as the euro currency and Schengen border controls.

&gt; Who signed ACTA for the UK

EU states share common policy in this area and it was signed by an EU representative at a [ceremony](http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/i_property/acta1201.html) in Japan. It was also signed by a UK representative according to the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17125469), probably the ambassador to Japan.

&gt; Do we have to ratify it? Or are we now part of the ACTA treaty?

It still has to get consent from both the EU council and the EU parliament. ACTA will be debated in EU parliament in June and has also been referred to the Court of Justice for a ruling on if it is compatible with EU rights and freedoms. 

&gt; why is the UK news organizations so quiet

&gt;Of course there’s an easy explanation as to how we’ve managed to get away with such low spending. First, it’s been well spent. Second, because health care has been state run it’s been efficient. Third, our primary care system has massively reduced our cost of secondary care compared to places like France – who have got this seriously wrong. Fourth, we might have had to spend more, but that was catch up. And also, regrettably, wasted on introducing market mechanisms.

&gt;There are lessons to be learned from this.

&gt;First we need to eliminate those wasteful market mechanisms.

&gt;Second, we need to ensure we maintain state control of health care in the UK.

&gt;Third, we need to reinforce the integration of primary and secondary care in this country, rather then divide and separate them.

&gt;Fourth, we need to be seriously proud of what we’ve done and sing its praises.

Governments generally have some sort of debt hanging over them and it isn't a huge problem as long as it is being tackled in some shape or form. 

What we have is a deficit (more money going out of the govts coffers than coming in) that when the coalition inherited office was at 11%  and should hopefully should be significantly reduced or eliminated around the 2015-17 period. 

We are spending more money than we receive but household budgets are not the same government budgets and do not share parallels in responsible courses of action. 

I generally agree with the deficit reduction programme this govt is embarking upon but this is a simplistic and populist explanation of the situation at hand.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;You made a statement (""it's pretty clear there are millions of unemployed people claiming benefits who have no intention of working"") with no evidence to back it up.

It was never a literal number. But any real world experience tells you that people who are claiming benefits are not looking for work. Statistics don't cover people flat out lying. That's why there are no number on this sort of thing.

&gt;You're now suggesting that the burden of responsibility lies with me to prove you wrong, despite the fact that you've provided no evidence. Hmmm.

Prove me wrong then. If you are so adamant that statistics prove everything, why don't you use some to prove me wrong?

&gt;If you're going to argue a point, you really need to have some data to back it up, or you'll be seen as arguing from a position of ignorance and that's how people can end up looking stupid.

My key and only main point is that you need to work for money. You shouldn't be paid for idleness. I never changed this point and I never will.

&gt;This is a subject I'm interested in so I've already looked at the data published by the ONS. I urge you to look at that data yourself so you can, at least, be arguing from a position of knowledge.

Good for you, it doesn't interest me in the slightest nor did it have any relevance to anything I am saying. Employment figures have nothing to do with the number of people really looking for work.

&gt;By that rationale, we should remove the National Minimum Wage presumably? After all, it would cost us less.

Well, that's a different issue. Since work is different from work experience, which is really what is being done for the dole. But yeah, there are indications that a lower public sector minimum wage may be better for the tax payer. 

&gt;You've arrived at a position without any corroborating evidence, you've flip-flopped on your views (first it was ""millions"", then ""may not be millions""), and you've flitted from point to point like a butterfly, failing to engage properly with most of those points on the way. And yet you don't see any bias in your arguments?

My views have never once changed, they all have plenty of evidence. I'm just not sure what evidence you're looking for. What do you expect me to do, carry out a survey on job seekers? You can take a look at public spending statistics if you want, or the millions of people out of work.

I have engaged all of your points that were worth responding to. A lot of the time you would just try to change the subject and try to paint me as immoral.

&gt;I've worked my entire life and have never claimed a single benefit (JSA, Child Benefit, Working Family Tax Credit, etc). This is because I've been extremely fortunate and I never, ever forget that. I'm completely aware of the fact that life is rarely simple and lady luck can fuck people over in a heartbeat, without warning. Whilst there will always be a small core of people who will screw over any system to their own advantage, the majority are folks who find themselves unemployed, do not want to be in that position but, while they are, we are duty bound to help them, as fellow human beings.

And yet you are perfectly happy to allow people to take your money for not working? I have no problem with people being given JSA, they should just have to work for it.

You seem to be painting it as if I was against JSA completely. It just needs to be reformed completely.

I am also of the idea that I should only help those who help themselves. If you seriously think people who are claiming benefits are really just the less fortunate, you should probably turn on the Jeremy Kyle show. That is the sort of scum I don't want to be supporting.

&gt;Ad hominem

Rich coming from you. You spent the last few posts calling me ignorant, stupid and trying to put words into my mouth.

Benefits are not a right. You should have no right to claim money from the working people.

“The tax system is more progressive than I had imagined,” he said. “The proportion paid by the top one per cent has increased radically since 2000. I think people might be quite surprised to find out that our system is a pretty progressive one.” 

The same claims (made by Fraser Nelson) are dissected quite well here: 

&gt;What’s more, if inequality rises, so too will these ratios. If our dictator and his cronies rob the poor of half their income and divide it among themselves, the share of total taxes paid by the top 1% will rise from 20.4% to 24.7%, whilst the share paid by the top 5% will rise to 78.5%. By Fraser’s reckoning, our society has become more redistributionist. Which it has - but in precisely the opposite direction that Fraser would think.

&gt;So, the share of taxes paid by the rich tells us nothing about whether society is equal or the tax system progressive. To believe they do is to commit a plain logical error.

true,sucksqueezebangblow1,null,null,"My younger brother at 20 is looking to get his own car. He's spent about £600 on lessons, My dad and I have taken him out in dad's car to give him some practice, now he's got his licence (the test with car hire is like £130, theory test is what ever it is now, provisional licence £50) he's looked to get a £800 skoda fabia and the insurance is £2400 best quote online. Stupid. If you do the pass plus it becomes £20 cheaper, shame it costs £125 to do the pass plus. 

My tips, don't bother with pass plus, if you want to do it, fine but otherwise from a financial point of view, its a joke. Secondly you can't buy a car be the main driver and insure yourself on a parent's policy, ie they're the policy holder and you're the named driver but you're actually the main driver of the car. Its called fronting, its illegal and if your insurance company find out, you're in doo doo, if they find out after you've had a crash, even one which isn't your fault, even bigger doo doo. However what you can do is buy the car, buy the insurance policy (so you're the policy holder) and have your parents added to the policy as named drivers. This brings the quote down because the companies assume that you'll be more careful because your parents want to drive the car and therefore give a crap about it. This will bring it down a bit. Usually third party fire and theft is the cheapest option. Sometimes fully comp is again its assumed if you buy third party only insurance (the legal minimum level of cover) that you don't give a toss about the car so it can actually cost more. So have a look at fully comp. As an added bonus most fully comp policies insure you to drive on a car which you do not own (but must be insured by the vehicle owner). So even if the fully comp is a bit more you may want to consider it. Also a lot of people just put in 10,000 miles a year for their annual mileage but do you actually do that much? The less miles the less risk. Also have a look around for trade insurance. The national farmer's union offers pretty cheap insurance. 

However I'd say ditch the car if you can. I've got a motorbike. If you want to get into it cheaply you can. All you need is provisional licence, a CBT (one day course about £140) the bike (125cc), a helmet (though I'd recommend you get more safety kit than that, gloves and boots at a bare minimum) and insurance which will be about £500 for a new rider. £20 a year to tax, 70mpg if you don't rag it. OK you can't go on a motorway and its not ideal on country lanes because the 125cc engines aren't all that powerful. The bikes are cheaper than cars but the 125cc bikes tend to be expensive for what they are due to their popularity. If you want to get your full licence you can. If you're over 21 if you do it on a more powerful machine that will give you a full licence so you can ride 1litre+ super sports bikes. If you're under 21 then you're restricted for 2 years to 250cc machines (or less).  ",0,1330360030,null,0,true,0,c3vih4f,t3_q7xs5,t1_c3vih4f,t3_q7xs5,null,1428429263,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not really. 8 states? That's not national. We don't quite have gay marriage, we have civil unions, that are the same in all but name. There is a large movement to relabel that as gay marriage proper, and I expect to see that in the next year or two.

Saying the US is ahead is clearly hokum. You only just repealed DADT - gays have been in the military for around 12 years here. They recruit at gay pride parades (with I think a big pink tank).

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"&gt;any real world experience tells you that people who are claiming benefits are not looking for work.

""Real world experience"" (or anecdotal evidence, to give it it's correct name) tells you that people who are claiming benefits aren't looking for work.  That's clearly not true and to suggest otherwise is sheer madness.  I think you need to stop generalising - it's doing you no favours.

&gt;If you are so adamant that statistics prove everything, why don't you use some to prove me wrong?

I have.  The link in my previous post takes you to the ONS website and the spreadsheets that you need.  Those spreadsheets do not support your initial assertion that there are, and I quote, ""millions of unemployed people claiming benefits who have no intention of working"".

You can't just make a claim, refuse repeatedly to provide evidence to back it up, and then place the burden of evidence on me.  Rational discourse doesn't work that way.

&gt;You shouldn't be paid for idleness.

I couldn't agree more.  However, those who have been made unemployed and are currently looking for work - how does making them work for their JSA allow them to find employment?  Read some of the evidence which shows the percentages of people who have done these schemes who've actually been given a job at the end of it.  A lot of the big companies were taking them on for the eight-week period, then ditching them without a job offer and simply taking another JSA slave on.  What was their reward for hard work?  Oh, that's right, being sent to the back of the dole queue.

&gt;My views have never once changed, they all have plenty of evidence

Where?  For the love of God, where??  You haven't provided a jot of evidence to back up your position!  Not a jot!

&gt;And yet you are perfectly happy to allow people to take your money for not working?

I am perfectly happy for the Government to support people who are currently unemployed while they're looking for work, yes.  That's very different to paying people money ""for not working"".

&gt;If you seriously think people who are claiming benefits are really just the less fortunate, you should probably turn on the Jeremy Kyle show.

I see.  I read reputable news sources and look at statistical evidence from the ONS; you get your 'facts' from the Jeremy Kyle show.  I think that tells us all we need to know.

&gt;You spent the last few posts calling me ignorant, stupid and trying to put words into my mouth.

I challenge you to find a single post where I have outright called you stupid.  Go on.

As to the 'ignorant' part, yes, I have effectively called you ignorant because you are.  Ignorance is defined as a lack of information or knowledge.  You have stated that data from the ONS ""doesn't interest me in the slightest"".  You have failed repeatedly to provide any evidence for the assertions you make.  The only data you're able to provide is a penchant for watching the Jeremy Kyle show.  So yes, you are ignorant.

I dont know what you tried to do but i gathered the info i was looking for.

Having had first hand experience in another country of a NHS run along the lines of what is being proposed, I don't see a problem.

I don't give a flying fuck how its run as long as I get treated correctly and promptly and it is still free at the point of need. Certainly experiences of my local NHS Trust are completely the opposite with an immediate family member not being treated properly and spending 3 months sat in hospital waiting for an OP because of fuck ups on an almost daily basis - I lost count the number of times he saw the specialist and was asked how was he recovering even though he'd not had the op. They didn't know. And when they finally did the op, they fucked it up so he's got to go back in to get it sorted. That was supposed to happen a year ago. Its not an important op - its just the thing that keeps his heart going.....

When you live where I do where yours and the adjacent NHS trusts are as incompetent as ours are, ANYTHING has to be better.

No, I agree with you really.

Firstly, when the NHS is in the hands of the government, they have a responsibility and an interest in making it as accessible and high quality as they can because they want to be voted in at the next election, if they do a bad job we have the power to kick them out of the parliament. What this bill will do is move the power out of our hands and give it to private firms.

Another problem with handing over the power of the NHS to private firms is that there main interest will be in making money and not providing adequate healthcare--they want profits, that is how a business is run and this should *not* be how a nation's healthcare should be run.

In short, the government have an interest in giving us good health, the private firms will have an interest in (first and foremost) making money. That is the major problem.

It is quite posible that he arrived in london pretty much immediately after ending the war. 

His slightly bipolar and very dark personality would be a product of having been regenerated after committing what is essentially genocide. This is also why he is so attached to Rose as 10.

Not sold on Pereira just yet, he looks too gung ho for the Premiership at the moment. Moutinho has had a lot of promise for many years but again, is he the right player for our league?

If we can sign Hulk for a semi-realistic fee (not £50 million or more) then he'd be an amazing signing for us.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's mentioned in Torchwood by Jack that in the future there aren't as many ""rules"" (I assume social rules) about sexuality - that's how he explains his promiscuity and he also makes fun of the Torchwood team for being so reserved. Jack says that he likes anything so long as it's beautiful, and implies that he's been in relationships with aliens as well. I'd guess that the general idea is that most aliens who have that level of understanding and intelligence are pansexual with slight preferences towards certain sexes/species (I suppose much like a hetero male human might like blondes, but would still be fine with a brunette depending on everything else?)

The Doctor likes Earth a lot, and he seems to be more attracted to female humans, but I doubt other alien races have gender the same way Earth species do, so on some planets, sexuality might not even be a ""thing"", therefore I don't think the Doctor (or any other time lord, or alien in general) could be counted as strictly one form of sexuality. Indeed, it could be that alien races only use sexual encounters for reproduction and nothing else, so they could be in a loving relationship with their partner, then think ""hey, our species seems to have a dwindling population, baby time"" and go and mate with the right gender to make a baby with, then go back to their partner. (That's assuming they reproduce sexually at all)

Saying all that, the Doctor himself is only half Time Lord (somewhere in canon, his mother is a human), so it's possible he inherited the idea of monosexuality (or bisexuality) from his mother's human genes.

**TL;DR:** Although there's no conclusive evidence, from the bits I've picked up, I'd assume that future human races (like Jack's) and other alien races (like the Time Lords) are predominantly pansexual, with leanings towards specifics, as opposed to strictly hetero/homo/bi-sexual.",0,1330375791,null,0,false,0,c3vlipi,t3_q8cvn,t1_c3vlipi,t3_q8cvn,null,1428430671,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I've had one complaint held up by the Health Service Ombudsman, obliging my GP to formally apologise, and I have another complaint being dealt with at the moment. 

The medical staff I deal with regularly are fine, with the exception of one cack-handed phlebotamist who did something that caused so much pain I blacked out; everyone else has been a time-serving, inefficient, supercilious, jobsworth. The people at the PCT are the worst.

Instead, it was left up to the british Royal Navy to protect them.  It was in our interest to do so, to stop the Spanish and Portugese from reclaiming the countries they had lost to revolution.

Spurs were supposed to 'demolish' the Gunners - look what happened. Utd are hanging on to 2nd because of their early run. If their slump continues it might end up in a four-horse race to second spot towards the end of the season. We won't totally deserve it but we sure as heck won't mind!

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

I for one could do without the likes of that unibrowed idiot BOSINGWA and I know I'm not alone in that.  I also wouldn't mind seeing Malouda or Kalou leaving for decent amounts of money.  Meireles I have no problem keeping as a sub and I think our defense just needs time to adjust to each others' style.

Frankly, having too many people around competing for the same spots is what causes the rifts in the dressing room as well as what divides the squad.  Training should be focused on improving the squad, not determining it. Players whose roles are already determined will develop together. I think what Chelsea needs more than ever now is consistency in selections and total fan support.  After all, we're all BLUES.

You mean there's a whole world with, like, different people?!"" It's kind of a head/desk moment.

""Do people actually like Rose Tyler"" sounds like something a 12 year old would tweet. It's a rhetorical question that doesn't go anywhere. It's just a setup for a bunch of ""I know, rite?"" responses, which don't offer anything either.  And your explanation wasn't much better. It came across as ""coz she's stupid and she sux!"" Ranting is ok, but I don't think we have to throw quality out the window when we do it. ;)

For example, had you posted something like ""Here's why I'm disappointed in Rose Tyler"" and then offered examples of how you felt she could have had a more productive role, that would have set up a better situation for actual discourse. And clearly you are capable of that, as your reply above indicates. So this was perhaps a harsh nudge to bring your better game because you do have working thought-meats. ;)

Back to Rose -- I agree that Rose is frustrating at times. I think in the second season the writers sometimes didn't know what to do with her, or used her as a plot device instead of a Character. Maybe they were too busy figuring out a new Doctor incarnation, or maybe just found they had written themselves into a corner with Rose's limitations. 

I know I was a bit irked in *Impossible Planet*, when everyone else had a job and was running around trying to solve the problem... and Rose just stood there with a comm radio saying unhelpful things like ""remember to breathe, breathing is good."" She had nothing to do for much of the episode. Then in part 2 (*Satan Pit*) she was finally given the chance to do something and at least redeemed herself in a big way. 

When you say ""their bond"" do you mean the romance angle, or just their general connection?

true,Bioluminescence,tardis,TARDIS,"I imagine that, in peacetime, a Timelord would generally have a long and peaceful life with whatever love they should happen to find - whether it hetero-, homo-, bi-, pan-, a- or any other possible combination of sexual.

Then, when that long life should come to an end, most likely the result of old age (because I imagine they've got most other medical issues stitched up with their technology) they'll say their goodbyes, kiss their grown children farewell, and quietly slip away as their present re-incarnation.

They'll regenerate and in their place will be a new Timelord - one with the memories of the old one, but a fresh start and not the same personality as the previous.  Their friends and family will welcome them, but understand that they're not the person they knew and loved - not quite.  The newly regenerated Timelord will be able to reminisce, swap old stories, advise their children, be good friends - but should be free to go out and find their own new loves.

The Doctor is unusual in that he lives a very dangerous, exciting, and violent life - going through regenerations at what is probably a highly alarming pace.  I can see why his example would make people think that romantic love would have to persist - he makes it seem that a regeneration only lasts a handful of years - but I think he's an anomoly, and that 100+ years of life would be far closer to normal between regenerations.

true,alister667,lfc68,,"First it's great that Shelvey has done so well this season (especially at Blackpool), it's great we have young midfielders coming through. The upper reaches of the premiership is very competitive and it's a hard place for young midfielders to learn their trade without looking out of their depth.

Henderson is not yet 22. Do you remember many people's thought's on Lucas Leiva 4 years ago? I say we give the guy football and see how he develops over the next two or three years. He's only been with the club 8 months for goodness sake. To write him off so soon is premature. He's very athletic, keeps possession pretty well (usually), can slide a through ball in and he did create a lot of chances at Sunderland (when he was Shelvey's age) and that was at Premiership level.

As for Kenny being above criticism, have you not heard people question the signing and playing of both Carroll and Downing? Both these players have had every kick scrutinised and criticised. I don't think it reflects reality to suggest that Kenny is untouchable. 

My own thoughts are that any player (except for the truly exceptional - like Suarez) need time to bed in and adapt to a different playing style, and different team mates. We'll see in a year or two. No one would argue Henderson is the finished article, but I would say he deserves our support for a little longer than 8 months.

Indeed for Carroll and Downing too I'm interested in how they gel into the team, how Carroll learns to link up with Suarez, how Downing and Enrique work together. I can see things beginning to work sporadically but it will need a little time. For these two we'll see how things progress next year. For just about any signing the test comes in their second year, not their first.

It's also important to remember that sexuality is a sliding scale rather than a black-and-white tick box. Most sources agree that it's not nature vs nurture, it's nature AND nurture. Your environment as well as your genes influences that kind of thing.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"Interesting. Now, I haven't watched nearly enough Classic Who to make these statements with any sort of authority, but from what I understand, the Master is a fascinating character because he is something just a little bit different every time. That is, he's always magnificent and evil, but the exact nature of the Master changes. So whereas the Daleks are Daleks, forever and always (well, besides in *The Daleks*, etc.), the Delgado!Master is not at all the Roberts!Master (and the less said about that the better), who is neither the Jacobi!Master nor the Simm!Master. (And isn't it a pity that we didn't get more Jacobi?)

Point being, the Master is another Time Lord, and just as the Doctor changes but is still essentially Doctor-y, so too does the Master change from being smooth and goatee'd to astral snake thing to skeletal and lightning-y. But in his most recent incarnation, the similarities and parallels between the Master and the Doctor were most intentionally highlighted; the hi-tech screwdriver, the companion, the charismatic unpredictability, and so on. John Simm played the Master, to my mind, as what the Doctor *could* be, but chooses not to. So the Simm!Master was written, in my opinion, to be a fairly direct commentary on the 10th Doctor.

Now, what would Benedict Cumberbatch bring to the role? Without typecasting him too much, he has his own energy when he plays Sherlock, but I can also see him being wonderfully laconic and Alan Rickman-ish. In the former case, he'd be repeating the function of John Simm's Master, only to Matt Smith's Doctor - which would be interesting, but we've already seen the Dreamlord do it, and it would just be retreading the same ground to no good end. Alternately, he could play in stark contrast to the 11th Doctor, which would be interesting in his own right; with a Doctor as impatient and frenetic as Smith's, I think that an archenemy who would lay elaborate traps and play the waiting game would be a great foil.

Baseless speculations aside, I am going to say that I am against this. As much as I enjoy Cumberbatch, I would like to see an unfamiliar face when the Master returns. Note that I am also against seeing Cumberbatch play the Doctor ever, as controversial as that may be.

Reason? Because, ultimately, if this casting goes forward, the chances of a Doctor Who/Sherlock crossover just got all the dimmer.",0,1330403907,null,0,false,0,c3vqoq2,t3_q8uso,t1_c3vqoq2,t3_q8uso,null,1428433369,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

AVB seems to be looking at Portuguese league players pretty specifically. Is this good? Should we be looking elsewhere? Just because João and Hulk were on AVB's winning team does that mean their skills will just transfer over into the PL?

What about the idea of AVB's tactics. I've seen in threads that people are a little sick of him trying to brute force his tactics on the team to little or no avail. Doesn't bringing in two of his former players just further that notion?

Also, how cheap are these guys going to come?

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"Not disputing the brilliance at all, please don't get me wrong. And the cold and distant aspect of his hypothetical portrayal would definitely highlight both how alien the Time Lords truly are, and make Smith's Doctor's humany-wumany-ness all the more profound. Because the Eleventh is both wonderful at relating to people and terribly bad at it, all at once. When it counts (and I'm using moments like the end of *Vincent and the Doctor* and his interactions with Madge from *The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe* as the primary instances that come to mind here), he is spot on and says some of the most quotable things. But he's also fantastically bad at other very basic social interactions, like texting and scones, or tears. And Benedict's Sherlock is also fantastically bad at human relations, but in his own completely alien sort of way. So casting him as the Master, someone absolutely sociopathic (though not human to begin with, so does that still count?) would be a truly inspired piece of work.

This is a very long and roundabout way of saying that I entirely agree with you and think that Benedict Cumberbatch would play a truly memorable and chilling Master. I guess it would depend on how much of a permanent fixture the Cumberbatch Master would want to be in the series; back in the day, Delgado's Master was a fairly recurring character once upon a time (a quick [IMDB search](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0217069/filmoseries#tt0056751) and some [Wikipedia cross-referencing] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctor_who_serials#Third_Doctor) reveal that he was in every episode of season 8, about half of season 9, and about a third of season 10; in other words, just under half of Pertwee's run), but has since been much less regular in his appearances.

On the one hand, someone as brilliant as Cumberbatch deserves to be both shown off as much as possible and savored at the same time, sort of how they used Moriarty in *Sherlock*. So I'd be conflicted over casting Cumberbatch and wanting to see him all the time and wanting to keep him in the shadows forever. Plus, I do want to see him go on to so many other beautiful things, sort of like how I'm conflicted over wanting to see Matt Smith do beautiful things in his career and yet never wanting him to leave.

All that being said, I'm going to come back to my initial final thought. Wholock: It needs to be a Thing.",0,1330411114,null,0,false,0,c3vrv0q,t3_q8uso,t1_c3vrv0q,t1_c3vqx4j,null,1428434128,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Seems a tad contrived.

The EU Competition appears to be a red herring.

It's interesting because the ECJ concluded SNS's (Sistema Nacional de Salud) activities were of a social nature and for non-economic purposes.

So by creating a private market within the NHS, our current Government will be deliberately exposing the health service to competition rules.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"One of the big problems with the bill is that there has been a lot of talk about it but hardly any details given out about it in the media . Hence it has been very difficult forming an opinion about it . The most that I have seen about it was in this article in the Telegraph .

Going on what I can pick up in specific and in general I would say that what David Cameron needs to say is ""we need to rethink this"" and he needs to do just that . In doing so I think he will rise high in the public esteem . He will look like he's coming to grips with things . At the moment he looks like he's making a lot of very basic mistakes and he's consequently floundering .

He needs to pull the legislation back and he needs to greatly simplify it and stage it . One of the things that he has been talking about is small government . By the sound of it the legislation is not small government . Also by the sound of it it hasn't been at all well thought out - it's been rather thought out in peoples comfort zones and hasn't , as a result , had anywhere near a proper and full job done on it . This is certainly a strong characteristic of the Cameron government .

Any changes anywhere need to be evolutionary and they need to be brought in in stages . In such a manner people can get used to the stages in a gradual moving forward process . They will see the clear directions and the reasons for them and benefits being derived from them . They will feel that they and society are achieving things by these changes . And if mistakes are made these can be identified and corrected . Government should be set up for this process .

If I , as an engineer , get a 1800 page document slammed down in front of me the first thing I reach for is the bin . It is the same with any design - whether it's the NHS or any other aspect of government - the most basic, most fundamental rule is the ""Keep It Simple Stupid"" rule . If you don't understand that you are asking for failure and it indicates that you just don't understand a lot about design and about life . You don't make yourself out as being more smart , quite the opposite .

true,gIowingsheep,ter-manx,Isle of Man,"Global temperatures have risen (on average). So yes, it was (on average) colder in the 70s.  Then there was a period, 90s~00s, where winters were (on average) mild, with little widespread prolonged snow. We've now had successive years of serious winter cold, not just in the UK but right around Europe.

The naive argument is: it's all just 'weather' but there are various mechanisms that the drive the averages (the climate), eg influences that tend to make winters milder. Formulating such mechanisms and figuring out their effect on the average weather, ie the climate, and testing such hypotheses against data, isn't easy but that's what climatologists strive to do.

If you read the article it outlines how with Arctic ice melt, the Arctic waters have become warmer and air above more humid, which weakens the temperature and pressure gradient with the mid-latitudes and hence weakens the westerly jet stream. This means (on average) fewer depressions with wet and windy weather and more 'blocking' high pressure areas which drags in Arctic air and hence snow across Europe. And, to repeat, this isn't just a hand-waving explanation. The researchers have tested it against the data and it seems to be the case. You'll have to read the paper for the details.

So, paradoxically, increasing global temperatures is apparently making our winters colder - it's 'climate change' not 'global warming'.",0,1330418636,null,0,false,0,c3vsprd,t3_q8m16,t1_c3vsprd,t1_c3vnlso,null,1428434584,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Akasa,derbyshire,Peak District,"For those without word/openoffice/libreoffice here's what the document has to say on the UK. Looks like it was written a fair while ago.

**UK
Security** 

•	Financial crime is something that we need to keep abreast of in the UK. London is a banking center and we should be aware of any financial/business crime that is going on there.

•	Russians in London, there are a lot of them there. Let’s make sure we are following what they are doing and any stories that come out. 

•	Soccer. Who is buying what team. May seem silly, but European soccer leagues are avenues for money laundering. Good to know who is laundering what money. 

•	Terrorist groups, anything that has to do with domestic Muslim population.  New anti-terror laws and such. 

•	Irish terrorist groups and their activity. It has obviously declined in recent years, but it can still pop up from time to time. 

•	Lots of anti-immigrant violence. UK has a long tradition of xenophobic violence. Lately, this has been very much the case in Northern Ireland. 

•	Protests and strikes. Not as extreme or crazy as in France, but still something that has to be watched carefully. Lately, the main strikes to watch are those happening in oil refineries with foreign employment. 

•	The military is facing a pretty serious budget crunch, and watching how that plays out – especially for the Royal Navy – is important.

**Politics**

•	With Gordon Brown in trouble, anything that seems to illustrate the erosion of his power is key. No matter how minute or local it may appear, we need to be informed to raise our situational awareness of just how screwed Labor is. Polling results are of interest as are individual MP statements and such. The most minute thing could become the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

•	 Labor Party leadership. Let’s try to figure out the power players that are coming up to replace Brown as party leaders.

**International Relations**

•	UK’s role in NATO, any announcements of what the UK is doing is key. 

•	UK’s relationship with Russia, anything that may illustrate in any way the souring of that relationship is key.

•	UK’s relationship with the EU, particularly in regards to financial regulation is a big issue. Also anything that Cameron is saying about the EU treaty ratification is key. 

•	France/Germany and the UK: We need to watch to what extent is the UK becoming the odd man out in Europe. This could very much be the case more and more as things progress and as Cameron enters into play. 

•	Russia/UK: Here, we need to monitor businessmen from Russia in UK and any reappearance of spats between the UK and Russia. 

**Economics**

•	City of London is the key financial center of the world. We need to carefully monitor statements by various banking industry leaders. 

•	Because of the recession, we need to vigorously follow everything that is going on with statistics and announcements coming out of the UK. 

•	Bankruptcies and bank bailouts are important. 

•	UK is a key military exporter, let’s keep our eyes open as to what they are selling and to whom.

I'll just have to live with that.

&gt;and you might want to reread my posts i was never my intent to talk about gypsies.

Why? Do my responses read as if I wasn't aware of this, or in a way that suggests I wasn't interested in your seperate subject? And you were somehow incapable of pointing this out at the beginning? Troll-mark #1.

&gt;Well i managed to gather what i was looking for, so i dont really get your point.

*Sure* you did. You gave a one-sided, seperate agenda troll response, refused to enter into a discussion or confirm my points with any effort of your own. And this wasn't just with my comments, either - making statements like this at this late a stage simply makes you look a bigger troll and *more ignorant*. Or are you the kind that thinks downvotes must mean you're right? Troll-mark #2.

&gt;You seems to be confused about the way reddit thread work, there is a tree were people discuss disconnected things.

No, there are threads. Learn to create your own instead of hijacking others. I've been on threads since Compunet - but I guess I've simply been mistaken all that time, eh? Oh look, you've been a redditor for *one month*. Troll-mark #3.

&gt;You are very confused about reddit thread principle

Really? Who's been agenda-hijacking and trolling, then, from a one month old account? Troll-mark #4.

&gt;there is no hijacking principle on reddit.

No, there isn't - hence the reaction you get; or do you still want to pretend that this wasn't what you were doing, with your account of one month? Troll-ery at the finest level, garnering you Troll-mark #5.

&gt;I dont know what you tried to do

Err....have a conversation about the subject. And yet you think I'm confused. Troll-mark #6.

&gt;but i gathered the info i was looking for.

Which appears to have been 'refuse to volunteer info or opinion then assume the person must be wrong because they refuse to do your own research and alleviate your ignorance for you despite the abundance of info available'. Oh, were you talking about something else? Why would I assume that, if it wasn't because you neglected to mention it for several days? Maybe the part where I illustrated the stupidity of basing *all* your knowledge on listed research? Or the part where you didn't even understand what an armchair expert was? Troll-mark #7.

&gt;You are still so confused about it it seems :)

Sure, just like all the other people that downvoted your responses to *their* commments. I guess it's everyone else and not you, right? Troll-mark #8.

&gt;Well you again misunderstood

I don't think you realise what that word means. It's not for others to understand you, but for you to make yourself understood to others. Troll-mark #9.

&gt;until now you were the subject of the study

You mean the study I refused to participate in? Another example of your apparent (= pretend) lack of comprehension. Your excuses really are getting shallow now - Troll-mark #10.

&gt;So given the time you spent trying to express something unclear i decided to give you an opportunity to improve. 

Sure you did; pretending that I might be unaware instead of addressing the subject you were hijacking (with a side-order of labelling stuff you don't/ won't reply to as 'unclear'). Laughable, and otherwise known as trolling. You're going to learn *so much* using this method - good luck. Troll-mark #11.

&gt;That's just very kind of me, but you should not assume that I care about it :)

They often make all sorts of invalid assumptions about their capabilities and the validity of their work . They also often make all sorts of invalid assumptions about people outside their circles . They are often very limited in life experience and certainly lack real world experience . As a consequence they often miss a lot of things and they often don't look at alternative approaches .

I have met quite a few of these types of people including 'brights' . These are areas I socialise in \ have connections into . I have usually found the 'brights' to be not so bright .

The fact is we are in one hell of an economic and social mess largely due to these so called 'bright' people so there is obviously something fundamentally wrong .

I think the standards have dropped massively over the last decade and a half and I think that a lot of the people in government don't have a clue how low a standard they are operating on . There is a standing joke - PPE means Pretty Poor at Everything . We saw the disasters with the Blair \ Brown government , we are now seeing disasters with the Cameron government .

The study seems to equate class directly with wealth, which is not even an over-simplification, it is just incorrect. Social class has very little to do with it, inasmuch as it still exists, and socio-economic class is far more complex than a bank balance. The ""socio-"" bit is the clue.

true,umbama,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;*Introduction of competing services means that you'll have different providers for different bits and bobs*

That's of no concern to me. If I go to A&amp;E with a broken arm I don't care if the provider is someone other than the provider responsible for the management of my rheumatoid arthritis. What's the difficulty?

&gt;*Can you imagine what it'll be like with different providers responsible for different parts of your care?*

Can't see the problem. Have you seen how crap they are currently? My GP prescribed a drug he shouldn't have done without taking BP tests, which he didn't do. My consultant put me down for 6x2.5mg of Methotrexate, my GP misread the computer screen and insisted on prescribing just 2x2.5mg *even after I told her she was making a mistake*.  When I later complained, just to show me who was boss, the Practice refused to issue more than a month's worth of MX at a time *even though they later admitted they did for other patients*.  When I complained they referred me to NICE guidelines saying the tablets should be dispensed in 12x2.5mg blister packs *not that they couldn't dispense more than one set of packs at a time*. They misread the NICE guidelines and lied about it.

The GP I subsequently moved to first of all allowed repeat prescription requests by phone, then didn't, then got my prescription wrong, then told me they'd been misled by my consultant, then backed down when I obtained a copy of a letter from my consultant confirming the mistake was with the GP, then allowed me to order repeats by phone again, then got my prescription wrong again. I had a long chat with the GP who apologised, offered me their online reordering facility. Got home, tried it, online reordering wasn't possible for MX because it's a rather dangerous drug.

This for a monthly repeat prescription that hasn't changed for 3 years. **They are all absolutely crap**.

And I'm given Methotrexate in the first place, which only slows progress of the disease, rather than the more modern biologics which can reverse the disease, because NICE says I can't have them unless and until the MX fails completely. Meanwhile the NHS funds homoeopathy.

As far as I'm concerned good GP practices should take over the bad ones, the whole system needs to be cleaned out and made more efficient. There needs to be real consequences to continued inefficiencies, bad practice and downright *lying*. They simply don't have the patient in mind when they devise their systems and practices.

Do you know, every 4 weeks I have a blood test. I hand a booklet over to a nurse who goes along to a computer screen and laboriously copies down all the test results from the last test 4 weeks ago into a line in the booklet and hands it back to me. I do nothing with it. In four weeks time I bring it along, hand it over, and let her copy down the results again from 4 weeks previously. What's the point? None. There is no point at all. Absolutely none whatsoever.

Basically his excuse is: he doesn't want anyone in the flat when the loft conversion is in full swing as it'll be very noisy and there's a chance my ceiling may need to be replaced so for health and safety reasons he wants the flat empty, which is utter bullshit. I watched the steel beams and materials go in, the conversion is already pretty much done.  

He did give me the option of moving back in in six months once the conversion has taken place but, and get this, at an extra £600/month for the extra room. Which I guess is what he'll get extra if he moves a family in here and he knows that there's no way I'll pay that amount.  

FTR; the loft conversion doesn't even link to this flat, it links to the tiny one bed flat across the hallway. So this flat will be exactly the same size.

true,spiz,null,null,"&gt; Do you know, every 4 weeks I have a blood test. I hand a booklet over to a nurse who goes along to a computer screen and laboriously copies down all the test results from the last test 4 weeks ago into a line in the booklet and hands it back to me. I do nothing with it. In four weeks time I bring it along, hand it over, and let her copy down the results again from 4 weeks previously. What's the point? None. There is no point at all. Absolutely none whatsoever.

The point is communication between services.  Your hospital, or other hospitals you may visit may not have access to results.  Your book may be handy.  Methotrexate may affect your liver so I presume the blood tests have something to do with that.

Many of your other concerns relate directly to your GP or communication between the GP and the hospital (different services).

The new system will involve more parties and move your GP to the centre of that communication.  This bearing in mind that this communication involves a booklet you carry around.  The new system would play to the very weaknesses in the system that you've identified, so why support it?  Not all change is good.

&gt; And I'm given Methotrexate in the first place, which only slows progress of the disease, rather than the more modern biologics which can reverse the disease, because NICE says I can't have them unless and until the MX fails completely.

Unfortunately, treatment dose of Rituximab (according to NICE) [would cost almost £3500/couse](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=rituximab%20cost&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CEMQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nice.org.uk%2Fnicemedia%2Fpdf%2FTA126guidance.pdf&amp;ei=4tBMT9SxI8rv8QPbveXyAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3QgRHlO22UibvpXIeMt1erJ9mzA&amp;sig2=0BLh_cIjDyNvIJlcVjnQEw) with about 2 courses per month.  That's just the drug (not including the cost of the day unit).  Methotrexate costs £35/year (quick google gives that figure).  Nothing about a private system would change that.

The criterion exists to limit the NHS expenditure on individual treatments, bearing in mind that a lot of people will probably do quite well on methotrexate for quite a while (at 1/1200 the cost in the meantime).  Of course it is desirable that as many people as possible get these newer agents, but  I don't think we have any reason to believe the government's proposed system would increase access to them.  Over the years, the NHS has made strides to make these medications widely available and will continue to do so.  

Your consultant won't be able to change NICE guidelines and the Trust won't let him break from them without a particularly good reason (not for a drug that would cost £42,000-£84,000 per person per year, with 350,000 sufferers across the UK).  In the meantime, contacting your MP about the problem raises awareness and pressure can be made on the Trust and pharmaceutical company to find a better agreement.

&gt; Meanwhile the NHS funds homoeopathy.

Yeah, I don't get that.  (Incidentally catering to market pressures wouldn't necessarily see expenditure on homeopathy decrease).

&gt;As far as I'm concerned good GP practices should take over the bad ones

What about her sisters?

To understand what I am saying here's a little background information on parthenogenesis. The Doctor explains some of it as Jenny is introduced and I vaguely recall him explaining that his cells cell was used to create a diploid daughter cells, which then underwent meiosis to create haploid cells. This would cause an incidence of chromosomal ""crossing over"" to create a completely new genetic fingerprint. 

This is how Jenny was achieved. 

But, the creation of the haploid cells means that there are THREE other parthenogens with the potential for life, stored in a replicator machine on the planet Messaline (assuming the progenation machines ONLY took one cell).

&gt;The News of the World has never supplied a coherent explanation for why we were placed under surveillance. Ill 2003, David, together with Dick Fedorcio and Commander Andre Baker, met Rebekah Brooks to discuss the matter. She repeated the unconvincing explanation that the News of the World believed we were having an affair. She agreed to look into Alex Marunchak’s associations with Rees and Fillery but to my knowledge nothing further was ever said about the subject, indeed Mr Marunchak was subsequently promoted. 

&gt;I believe that the real reason for the News of the World placing us under surveillance was that suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to try to intimidate us and so attempt to subvert the investigation. These events left me distressed, anxious and needing counselling and contributed to the break-down of my marriage to David in 2010. Given the impact of these events, I would like to know why the poIice did not investigate why we came to be placed under surveillance by a newspaper like this.

The first season picks up momentum about halfway through, with the episode ""Dalek."" ""The Long Game"" is pretty okay, ""Father's Day"" is good, and then ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" (Two parter) are both really good.

If you want to get through season 1 just to get to the ""good stuff"" and Tennant, watch the above episodes, ""Bad Wolf,"" and ""The Parting of Ways."" Then go into the Christmas Special and season 2.

Doctor Who, on the whole, is pretty campy, ESPECIALLY with RTD running it. I prefer Moffatt's take on the show (with Matt Smith - that's seasons 5-present).

Regardless, I wasn't saying there was no majority I was saying that if you make a statement about something without statics to back it up, the statement becomes nothing more than groundless opinion, that the opinion may be right is irrelevant, we've all got opinions its facts that matter.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You could be against the evictions without having been involved in the protest. 

If everyone was 'against', wouldn't there be more people complaining in the first place? Or alternatively, more people protesting online against the evictions? There aren't, or don't seem to be - so even if it's through apathy, you can't consider the remaining people as agreeing with building a camp as 'taking action'.

&gt;So that is not usable as evidence of a majority or minority either way.

No, it isn't - but complaining about an assumption based on an assumption of your own...not sure where we go from there; one can suggest that the numbers not protesting the evictions is significant, but you can't then say that's irrelevant without proof of your own - otherwise you're then able to say that a protesting group of any size is 'significant'.

&gt;I think it's possible you replied to the wrong comment

No, I replied to the correct one. When someone uses a general phrase like 'everyone', with a humorous description (like 'crusties') that everyone will obviously *not* agree with, and someone points out that their individual view is not the same and that the person is 'wrong', they're doing three things; a) using a generality as an excuse to score silly points, b) talking like my father-in-law, and c) assuming their individual viewpoint is far more important than they think it is :-)

Personally I've lived through several generations of people assuming that if they camp out somewhere, for an extended period of time, they'll actually achieve anything. This has not worked at Greenham Common, The Newbury Bypass, Occupy X....the list of failures is a lot, lot longer than successes.

Yup.  There are theories that he was trying to wrest power back from the MIC, regain control over the US currency, etc., and I guess it's unlikely that we will ever know.

About half the NHS budget currently goes to profit making companies - whether that is medications, food, bandages, paint on the walls, etc etc etc.

Your local GPs have always been private profit making entities within the NHS as well.

What is proposed is not a substantive shift in what is already happening - that private profit making companies will provide medical services... but do so under the framework of the NHS, which is committed to providing services to patients at no charge at the point of use.

You can argue the methodologies being used to drive those changes, but the change itself is not a substantive one as far as the NHS has been run since its foundation 60 years ago.

Cable television is not required to follow these rules, and they tend to have more risque content. However, basic cable channels still typically avoid excessive profanity and nudity.

This is really going to bake your noodle later on.

What if Jenny is Susan's mother, and DW1+ never knew that?  That would make the statement kinda true.  What if in a story line yet to unfold to audiences, Jenny gives birth to Susan, which convinces DW11+ acknowledge Jenny as his true daughter.  Susan later meets DW1, who takes her to 1960's Earth to learn about human society and her story unfolds...

Or maybe the grandfather/granddaughter relationship was a white lie to cover up something in Susan's early childhood.. something DW1 felt responsibility for and to look after her as his own? Again, technically true statement.

No.  This is totally and completely wrong, because of the excellent way the money is paid back.  Going to university is, financially, a no-brainer decision, and anybody who is incapable of working that out doesn't deserve a place at an institute of higher education.  
  
&gt;The government are slowly trying to make our healthcare go more privatised  
  
I completely agree with you on this one.  Not only are the government slashing NHS spending and trying to force through de facto privatisation, despite pledging no top-down reform of the NHS in their election manifesto, they're also doing it ridiculously fast in the same way that Thatcher did with the coal mines, and at a time when there is very little private sector money around to replace the public healthcare spending.  Regardless of whether you think a private healthcare system is better or worse than a public one (and there are certainly merits and demerits to both approaches), the reality is that the situation we find ourselves in today means that the cuts will only lead to more job losses and an increased welfare bill because of that.  
  
&gt;and we're now making people work FOR FREE to get benefits... Have people started to realise the mistake in voting tory yet?  
  
This one's more complicated - there's little wrong, in principle, with making people work for 'out-of-work' benefits; it's arguably better to have people in low-level work than jumping through pointless hoops at the JobCentre so that they can get paid for doing nothing.  The main problem is that the government is making people work 30 hour weeks for the equivalent of around £2.50 an hour, despite the national minimum wage being £6 an hour.  12-hour weeks at minimum wage would cover the roughly £70 a week JSA, and I doubt many people would have a reasonable complaint if that was the way workfare was implemented.

The only aspect of the state involved in the NHS now is the staffing. Everything else is already private. Everything.

Now, you could argue, and I suspect that in a ham-fisted way you are trying - that there is some benefit in having the bricks and mortar that construct a surgical theatre owned by the NHS is preferable to own owned by ""Corp X"" and for the staff to be paid directly by the NHS.

It is possible that at some point in the future that all the buildings will be owned by private companies and they will provide the healthcare under contract to the NHS - but they can only do that if they are better than the existing in-house services.

So, if they are better, then why not use them? If they are worse, then get rid of them - but let the decision be taken based on who is better, not whether they are private or not.

Frankly, I don't care who provides me my healthcare so long it is free at the point of delivery and that it offers a decent value to the taxpayer funding it.

If pills X are handed to me by a nurse paid by Corp X or the Secretary of State shouldn't make any difference. Unless we think nurses and doctors will deliberately sabotage healthcare if they are paid by companies instead of the Dept of Health? 

If we were building the NHS today, no one would suggest a massive centralised monolithic structure - we would want a paying authority that then buys in services from whomever can deliver the best service for the best price.

Because you might have one person on the work programme [a programme I disagree with, btw, in its current guise] who gets £67.50 per week JSA. That would work out at a little over 11hrs of work, based on the full rate of minimum wage.

But what about someone who receives housing benefit? Would they be expected to work longer? How about people who also receive free prescriptions - say Asthma suffers on JSA? Would we expect them to work an extra 80 mins every time they need a new inhaler?

Then there's council tax benefits, glasses etc, etc.

You'd have no coherent or consistent number of hours across the programme, as people would be working different hours, based on the totality of their benefits.

A couple who have a joint claim receive a maximum of £105.95 between them - approx. £52.97 each.

If one of those people is on the work programme, how many hours should they work, in comparison to the applicable rate of minimum wage? 17hrs? [£6.08*17=£] or 8.5hrs? [£6.08*8.5 = £51.68]

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"Indeed, and there's also the mental strain on it. My dad gets really stressed as he comes home straight to my brother who has autism, who's a real handful also.

The relationship between my father and grandmother isn't exactly how it was, because of slight dementia she doesn't sort of realise he's her son (or most of the time I guess), just thinks it's his job to come and care for her. It's not just the hardness of the work in comparison to the pay, but also mentally too; it's worth less than if he was on JSA?

Just had a look on DirectGov and yes, it's a flat rate of £55.55/week, no matter how many hours you put in (but has to be above 30something). So say you're there caring for someone between 9-6 say (doing breakfast, lunch, dinner, cleaning, etc) every day, that's 9 hours a day. So 63hours/week, or lets say it's 3 less hours on the weekend, so 57. That works out as £1.02/hour. If they also go into hospital for more than a week, something like that, you're supposed to tell them this which means you won't get paid, meaning you could miss weeks, or even months pay in benefit for saving the state billions of pounds.
&gt;The weekly rate is £55.55. This is reduced by the amount of certain other benefits, including State Pension, that you get.

People working have the discretion of looking for a different job / jobsearching. No one forces you to look for another job, as part of your employment conditions.

Participants on the work programme, so I believe, are still required to sign-on every two weeks, and meet their original signing criteria. Included among those requirements? That the claimant be ""actively looking for work"".

I'm not sure how long you're supposed to spend each week, looking for work - let's say 2.5hrs [it's probably considerably more]. That's 10hrs per month, in addition to 120hrs on a work placement. For £260 [assuming you base this on JSA income only, and not other types of benefits / welfare]

£260 / 130hrs = £2 per hour.

If people are saying that ""participants"" should only work for their benefits / minimum wage.

£260 / £6.08 = a little under 43hrs per month / 10.5hrs per week",0,1330461403,null,0,false,0,c3vyisl,t3_q9y8b,t1_c3vyisl,t1_c3vye42,null,1428436923,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Furthermore, if you combine the net effects of the new income tax threshold indroduced by the LibDem corner of the coalition, you get some interesting figures (not that any students actually took the time to crunch the numbers themselves before occupying Fortnum's).

As you (possibly) know by now, the new repayment rate for student loans will start at £21k, be paid back at 9% of income above that, will track the rate of inflation, the interest will amp up at 0.00015% for every £1 earned over £21k, and the loans will be forgiven after 30 years.

Basically, once you account for the new (soon to be) £10k income tax threshold brought in by the LD, you will have to earn (on average) £32,500/year for thirty years (assuming inflation and wage increases are a net zero) to pay back the **OLD** student fees of £3,225/year x 3yr. The *new* rate of £9,000k/year x 3yr will basically not get paid back, unless you plan on earning ~£42k/year (career average) for thirty years; at which point arguments of the poor not being able to afford university fall apart.

Why were these kinds of figures not shown on the news when this stuff was hot shit? Because it didn't fit into the boilerplate outrage the unions and labour wanted to espose.

Labour make a pledge (as in a proper pledge, not a Nick Clegg pledge) to completely reverse absolutely ALL of the reforms outlined in this bill as soon as they are next in power, which could be as soon as three and a half years from now.

With that sword of damocles hanging over the reforms and the potential money making bonanza, private companies will think seriously hard about making the required investments involved in being a part of it if they could find their contracts revoked and source of income completely removed in a few years time.

In other words, no one will be willing to step up to the plate to service the governments reforms and so they'll fall through.

Another major problem is the damage that will be done in that time. It's already happening. These reforms started being implemented over a year ago. It's a toothpaste-back-in-the-tube situation, difficult now (which the Government is trying to capitalise on) and probably impossible in another three years. 

In fact, dispiriting thought. That might make it *worse*. If a company knew they had a limited time (three years, say) to turn a profit from something, and knew they could just give that thing back when that time was up, imagine what they could do to it. Suddenly there's no incentive to think of the future at all, and every incentive to asset-strip, bleed it dry, and go on your merry way.



Incidentally, one of the most disingenuous arguments I've heard so far is ""we have to push ahead because we've already started."" You shouldn't have started! It's not law yet! You *fucks!* And pushing ahead with a bad plan just because you've started on it? That's an awful awful reason.

The bill proposes to reorganise who controls the budget used to treat people on the nhs. Control of some of the budget would handed to GPs, and this seen as a way that privatisation through the backdoor could happen. Privatisation is seen as bad because services could be offered on a 'for-profit' basis, i.e. A company wants to make money out of treating someone, and I think this could cause things like mental health care for example to suffer due to it not being profitable.

There's a lot of other parts to the bill, but I think this is one of the main reasons for its unpopularity

And while I'm sure the airport doesn't wish to offend anyone, taking offence at perceived religious privilege is clearly not an excuse for making borderline racist remarks to strangers (a sternly worded complaint made about religious discrimination to management would obviously have been the way to go, although the guy was obviously frustrated at the time).

While it might seem that the security guard was over-sensitive, its also important not to make snap judgements. It may be that this person has to deal with such comments regularly though his work (given that airport security can be a stressful place for many passengers), and has developed a low tolerance for them.

I'd also challenge this idea that we shouldn't make allowances where possible for people of different culture or religion, that equality should mean 'one size fits all'. I believe an important aspect of tolerance is recognising that people of different cultures can have different needs, and that we shouldn't take offence at being asked to accept them.

I think it has more to do with the general level of apathy we have now, people just don't care about politics, they don't watch the news because it's boring, the most read papers are the Sun, Mail and Mirror which don't really have any depth to them. There is a huge disconnect between people and the politicians who are supposed to represent them.

And when it comes to protesting, there is also something approaching protest fatigue. We're seeing a lot of protests recently, and they all bill themselves as ""our last chance to stop x before it all goes to shit!"". There is only so many times people can hear about this before they just stop listening. And quite often the protesters alienate the public by getting sidetracked over relatively minor issues, which results in them all turning into meta-protests manned by the usual hippies and nearly always they end up with people chanting ""SCUM SCUM SCUM!"" at the police because they can't do something which has no impact on the cause they set out to protest in the first place. There often isn't any place for your average Sun or Mail reader who might quite like the NHS but doesn't want to hang out with the right-on-man crowd in these protest movements, even though they represent the majority of the population.

I believe an important aspect of tolerance is recognising that people can have different needs.  
  
Oh I agree completely.  I just think that if you're talking about security concerns, those concerns are the same for everybody; something is either a threat or it isn't.  Wearing religious clothing does not make it any more or less of a security issue to cover your face, compared to non-religious clothing.  
  
Admittedly, as you say (in fact even more than you say), even the Daily Mail article about the incident admits that everybody does face the same treatment at passport control, so the Muslim passenger in question had indeed gone through the same security checks as everybody else.  
  
&gt;And while I'm sure the airport doesn't wish to offend anyone, taking offence at perceived religious privilege is clearly not an excuse for making borderline racist remarks to strangers.  
  
I guess I just don't see how commenting (however tactlessly and probably inaccurately) on the alleged different treatment of certain religions can be considered even close to racism.  The notion just seems absurd to me, both because it is a complaint *against* discrimination, and because a religion is not a race.  
  
&gt;While it might seem that the security guard was over-sensitive, its also important not to make snap judgements.  
  
You're absolutely right.  The more I look at it, this seems to be more of a case where a guy got frustrated at what he mistakenly thought was preferential treatment, and made a comment that pissed off the staff who were overseeing that treatment, making them feel that they were being marginalised by the guy's comments.  I still don't necessarily think that warranted pulling him aside and essentially detaining him, but it certainly doesn't appear that he had a valid complaint regarding the supposed preferential treatment of the Muslim passenger.  
  
I didn't see anything in the article about this specifically, but I wonder whether if security had just explained that everybody does go through the same process, and that comments about preferential treatment are a slight on their professionalism, that maybe David Jones would have been quicker to admit he was at least possibly in the wrong and the whole ordeal could have been finished a lot quicker.",0,1330467559,null,0,true,0,c3vzss1,t3_q9jbk,t1_c3vzss1,t1_c3vzik1,null,1428437525,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hello,

The very basis of the NHS is under attack. I read this article in the Daily Telepgraph,


http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9106880/Read-this-and-prepare-to-fight-for-your-NHS.html

This is not a political statement. This is about protecting an institution we will all at some point come to rely on.

The NHS care provision in the UK is about to be forced to compete with third party providers, while third party providers do provide care they also must make a profit for their shareholders and owners. The National Health Service does not run as a profit making enterprise and we all benefit from this basis.

If the NHS state system is in competition with private companies, this will take money out of the National Health System and starve it of funds, this is analogous to the Walmart model, go into a town, use your purchasing power to undercut the competition and when they are out of the way and have gone out of business raise the cost. The National Health Service Hospital cannot compete for private health care in the same way. This is a form of privatisation of the Health Service. A system that is one of the most cost effective in the world, it does not need to change.
The legislation is now a complete mess.

This legislation is not about improving the NHS it is about handing our taxpayers money over to private companies who run their businesses for a profit, Much of the the medical industry are against it, but they need your support. So if you want the same system that you have been used to and that works so well this is what is what I suggest you do, go to

* Tripling University Tuition fees (I know the repayment scheme is generous but £9k a year is still a lot of money and will forever change the nature of some institutions like the Open University as people will only be able to afford to study for professional advancement)

* Welfare Reform Bill (almost passed) which again isn't _all_ bad but is punishing those least able to do anything about their situation (there are less vacancies than unemployed) and is a far cry from the New Deal style legislation that would actually get people back into work

* ACTA (just needs to pass the EU) - hopefully this won't pass the EU as the EU parliament is quite good a lot of the time, but if it does then it will not only erode the freedom of the internet but also outlaw generic medicines as counterfeits thus quite possibly leading to deaths around the world (it is international in scope) in search of profit

* [CCDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Capabilities_Development_Programme) (proposed, not yet a bill, but builds on earlier legislation proposed by New Labour so could get bipartisan support) - This is truly frightening and honestly just looks like they've read some dystopian novels and used them as instruction guides. I am amazed this isn't being covered in the mainstream media. It is essentially the mother of all surveillance bills and the death of civil liberties in this country.

* The possible independence of Scotland - the divisive nature of the government's devotion to austerity in the face of economic evidence is now empowering nationalists in Scotland such that they could possibly win a referendum on independence.

I read and worked hard and grew up with the idea that going to university would be worth the debt and I would get a good, well paying job that I wanted when I graduated. I am grateful for my loan, but it barely covered my rent, let alone books (i did history, you have to get a lot of books and even second hand it adds up) and food. So I got a part time job before uni and during to minimise my debt, whilst people around me racked up extended overdrafts and credit cards. I can not possibly comprehend paying back these debts, so if I were going this year, I don't think I would have.
I wanted to do a masters as it a necessity in the field I want to be in, but could not afford to, so instead I went travelling and tried to figure out other possibilities.


Back in the UK, I have been totally unable to get a job. I am not qualified for particularly skilled jobs such as engineering or medicine, and because I did a humanities degree, noone will believe that I have decent IT experience, and because I could not afford to do ""work experience"" during university, I have been rejected from 65 jobs in 8 weeks because I am ""inexperienced."" This is despite almost 10 years of working- babysitting, in supermarkets, pubs and even teaching. I have an abundance of volunteer work and other qualifications such as first aid, all of which I was told would make me invaluable in the employment market.


I have been on Job seekers allowance for the last month, and organised myself some work experience in the field I want to work in. I went to the job centre to sign on and mentioned this. I was told that I would not be allowed to do it because it wasn't approved, and if I wanted to get work experience then they could arrange for me to work in the local tesco. I pointed out I had 5 years of experience working in a supermarket, a job I had gotten WITHOUT work experience, why was this neccessary? My problem is I lack IT skills. They offered to put me on an IT course that would teach me word processing and powerpoint. This is despite me pointing out that it is impossible to be this age and not know way more than that. I did a degree, with an IT module, how could I have possibly done that without knowing all that basic stuff at least?


Yes, I know I am being given ""money for nothing"", but the only reason I don't have a job is because it's IMPOSSIBLE. Noone can say that i'm not trying- I have applied for almost 70 jobs. We're looking at 10 a week. I'm not aiming high or unrealistically. I apply for everything- bar work, administration, customer service.

true,chinkquentaco,lfc99,,"For those who are not familiar with baseball, or don't like to read long comments, I apologize in advance.

Having witnessed FSG's takeover of the Boston Red Sox firsthand, I can almost assure you that John Henry will spend big (likely on proven star players, if possible) over the off-season to assure Liverpool find their way back into greatness.

Let me explain: In 2002, FSG bought the Red Sox. Henry then acquired several players, among them were Bill Mueller and David Ortiz; both of whom would play key rolls in the Red Sox' rise to glory. The 2003 season ended with a heartbreaking Game 7 loss to the rival New York Yankees in the American League Championship. With just one more win, they would have had the opportunity to play for the World Series title (the highest honor in baseball).

Henry was not satisfied with the 2003 season's let down. In the following off-season, the Red Sox acquired Curt Schilling and Keith Foulke, both of whom were proven star athletes with tremendous talent. One could argue that these two players (especially Schilling) were just what Boston needed to get over the hump and become Champions once again. In 2004, behind David Ortiz' clutch hitting and Curt Schilling's clutch pitching, the Red Sox finally won their first title in 86 years.

The purpose of this comment is not to bore you with several paragraphs of baseball history or to glorify the Boston Red Sox, it is to say that John Henry has more or less been in this position before, and in the past, he has not been afraid to spend large amounts of money to bring his team glory.

TL;DR Expect at least one big signing this summer.

This is obviously a very difficult decision to make because if you're dying, £500k for cancer treatment after you've exhausted all other options seems completely worth it. It sucks but sometimes that decision has to be made, but it actually gets made much more routinely in the US under private insurance.

In the US insurance companies decide what treatments they cover and what medications they cover. If the insurance company decides it doesn't want to cover your lipitor you're shit out of luck, especially if it's the only medication that will work for your condition because it can cost upwards of $1000 a month for some medications. Generics are often not an option. 

Then on top of this you often have a lifetime limit on the amount of coverage your insurance will provide for you, sometimes it's $1 million, which seems like a lot, but when a two-night stay in a hospital can cost you $60k it doesn't last too long.

Even if the coalition breaks, I think the Tories would just carry on as a minority government. The point is to prevent the PM calling a snap general election, which is a good thing, but I think the flipside is that they're there until 2015 unless something causes the Tories to start voting to dissolve their own government.

You don't have to be left wing to be a decent person, and neither do you need to be left wing in order to promote an agenda of social change for the best. You just need to treat people like people. And there does seem to be a trend in left wing ideology towards rather authoritarian approaches forcing that faux level of perfection the various ideologies call for onto society with little regard for anything more than ticking ideological boxes. But then I'm a utilitarian lazy liberal who favors constant evolution over sudden revolution, so what do I know? 

As for focus group democracy, focus groups don't have any focus. So the way to jam it is to engage people in ways that will reach them. There is no point talking to a bunch of Telegraph readers from Henley in the same way as one would talk to university students on a culture studies course because you won't get past their filter bubble. It's the same with immigration issues, there are a lot of people who do have genuine concerns about immigration, but there does seem to be a tendency for certain aspects of left wing thought to treat these people like idiots who need to be re-education until they have the correct opinions. 

So baring an outside context problem, the answer is simply reaching out to people in ways that appeal to them, rather than attempting to be some annoying radical fueled by the folly of youth and a Kindle full of Noam Chomsky.

true,Tactful,null,null,"Bristol is one of the greatest cities in the world.

Firstly, it's a smaller and less busy, and less expensive London. We have that sense of nightlife you don't get in smaller cities whilst retaining the culture and sense of community derived from smaller cities. 

Secondly, we have great music and food, and were recently voted top in both.

Thirdly, being a port city, we not only have a beautiful harbourside but thanks to our less-than-stellar association with the transatlantic slave trade, our city is incredibly multi-cultural. Obviously you get the odd racist white wanker, but mostly it's better than other places. I went to falmouth once and I swear there was one black guy living there.

Fourthly, we're a hill city, and I believe this is important to a child when growing up. Basically, in a city like London, everything is flat and looks the same. You never know where you are, and distances become arbitrary values in your mind. From any area in Central Bristol, you can look around and see the rest of Bristol; this gives you a sense of distance and time: you can see that church that takes 15 minutes to walk to, so you better understand what 15 minutes walking is to you. This gives a child growing up in the city a subconscious sense of direction and well-being, and placement in the world.

Fifthly, we're fairly rich. This means services and goods cost a little more, but you get good quality stuff with a large variation. There's something to suit everyone's needs, regardless of budget; from high end restaurants to all-you-can eat buffets, Bristol has something for everyone.

Sixthly, the city's placement. We're close enough for you to day-trip up to London, and have great little stops around us such as Weston and Bath.

Seventhly, service-wise, we do well. We have one of the only sixth form colleges in our wider area, and a generally good education across the board. Our police services are active, and generally well-mannered and fair, and our other emergency service people are top-notch.

There are more points, but the most important ones are: Culture, hills, and multi-culturalism. The third point is important because I don't want my kids growing up in a society where the only non-white people they see are on television. As part of a bi-racial family, I think this is really important for a kid growing up, to have easy access to those different cultures, to be familiar with seeing people of different skin tones.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"Totally sensationalised, I didn't vote Tory, but to be honest, they're doing a lot better than I expected. I also think the Lib Dem's are doing incredibly well considering their situation. Raising the tax band to 10k is possibly the most progressive and generally helpful on many levels, policy of the coalition. They've also kept the Tories at bay over a number of things, including the healthcare reforms. If Labour had remained I genuinely think the country would be in worst situation, mainly from the bond markets losing confidence, but also due to the fact that they have nothing to offer, I've not heard one realistic policy from them, they just oppose everything and think they can pay for it all with bankers bonus money.    

I generally disagree with having to pay for HE but the figures make Uni within anyone's reach. The biggest problem IMO is living costs, maintenance should be higher for everyone, people from low income families I know that receive full loans and grants can afford to travel around the country applying for Grad jobs whilst I can hardly afford to eat. It's middle income families who are stuffed as the maintenance is so low (3k a year) that if your family can't afford to support you, you have to work every hour under the sun just to survive. This is often the case when a parent earns over the threshold but has large debts and more than one kid at Uni.  

Labour introduced private sectors into the NHS long ago and plenty of fine Healthcare systems across Europe have a mixed model. I'm not too fussed as long as it's free at point of entry and it continues to improve. I'm not sure whether the bill proposed is the right way to go about it. I do believe the private sector can offer some benefits whilst regulation attempts (not always successfully) to limit the fuck-ups and abuses, not that there isn't plenty of these in the current system already. 

Finally the workfare system is VOLUNTARY, it's not forced by any means and has a 50% employment rate. I've never really understood how so many people talk about the job situation being so bad, maybe it's a matter of location, but I've never struggled to find a job. Every time I've needed one I've found one within a week or two (I've had 4 different ones in total during my time at Uni), I also just secured one for the summer yesterday by making a simple phone call.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Tickets are cheaper booking in advance because railway companies prefer to be able to predict their passenger numbers. People who turn up and pay aren't predictable, so they try to encourage them to book further in advance.

I understand the commercial reasoning behind it. But part of the point of nationalised industries is to prevent people from being exposed to the worst of naked price pressures like that. It wouldn't be so bad, but the service is still crap and expensive, and it *still* gets billions in subsidy from the government. We seem to have the worst of both worlds.

By the way I think you are being a bit too kind with your predictability argument. There's also the fact that people who turn up and pay often have no choice but to travel then, or are businesspeople who don't care about the cost, so the rail company can gouge them for as much as they like.

&gt; As for the cost of a ticket - people say a car is cheaper, but that only applies if you already own the car, and even then, it isn't that much cheaper.

You are of course right about the difference between the total cost and the marginal cost of car trips.

But I have to disagree with you about it not being that much cheaper even with the car. Two or three years ago, my mum and I wanted to see my brother's graduation in London with a day's notice.

That name originally comes from a book called *The Making of Doctor Who* written by Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, both of whom were writers for DW itself.  There were two editions: one from 1972 aimed mainly at children, and a very heavily revised version from 1974 that updated the contents to the early stories of the Fourth Doctor but also was pitched at slightly older readers and took a behind-the-scenes view of television production.  I can tell you firsthand that when DW first started airing in the US, imported copies of the second edition of the book were pretty much the only reference source American fans had for the pre-Tom Baker history of the show.

When Marvel in the US reprinted old Marvel UK Doctor Who strips in *Marvel Premiere* the explanatory text pieces were written by a fan at Marvel who was cribbing information from that book.  And that's how this obscure bit of window dressing ends up in that comic.

P.S.: the middle symbol is an upper case Sigma, so this may be the original source of the idea a few years later that the Doctor's school nickname was Theta Sigma -- or ""Thete"" for short when he meets a Time Lord with a Brixton accent in ""The Armageddon Factor.""",0,1330485796,null,0,false,0,c3w37or,t3_qaiuv,t1_c3w37or,t3_qaiuv,null,1428439135,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

If you go all the way through, use Dailymotion.com and augment your viewings with the blog of these two hilarious Whovians: www.wifeinspace.com.

Now, to start getting into classic: First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. One of the best stories in classic Who- just to show you what's ahead. It feels very modern, the story is good, and it's a familiar subject. It'll give you an idea of pacing as well.

Be careful of the 108 missing episodes (well 106 now). If you're really dedicated, watch them. Though without the awesome videos of chadmoore36, you're stuck with Loose Canon Productions' reconstructions. If you don't do the reconstructions, it'll be hard to grasp the second Doctor (Troughton). His first story, Power of the Daleks, is one of the best Dalek stories imho. A black and white missing reconstructed 1960's episode of Doctor Who is one of my favorite Dalek stories. Who knew!

Drama:

* **Submarine** (indie coming of age film directed by Richard Ayoade)
* **Bronson** (starring Tom Hardy with a sweet stache as the mad prisoner)
* **An Awfully Big Adventure** (1995, Alan Rickman, backstage theatre goings ons)

Comedies:

* **Dead Fish** (I can not suggest this ridiculousness enough: Gary Oldman is a hitman, Andrew Lee Potts is a loser... cell phones get mixed up, the chick who plays Madame Kovarian in DW plays Oldman's dominatrix, Robert Carlyle play a crazy motherfucking loan shark/club owner)
* **Bunny and the Bull** (surreal kind of film by the guys behind Mighty Boosh) 
* **Blow Dry** (2001 comedy starring Alan Rickman as a barber that gets back into competitive styling)
* **Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story** (odd mockumentary with  Steve Coogan and Dylan Moran)
* **Run Fatboy Run** (may seem more mainstream, Simon Pegg, Dylan Moran)
* **The Trip** (originally a series, marketed as a film in US, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon wandering around the country doing impressions and being mean to each other)
* **In The Loop** (film spin-off of tv series ""The Thick of It, political satire with a hell of a lot of inventive cursing, a bit easier to get into as an American than the tv series because it's set in DC about the run-up to the Iraq War

Action: 

* **Layer Cake** (2004 action film sort of cross between Guy Ritchie and James Bond films starring Daniel Craig before he got famous)
* **Gangster No. 1** (aka hey look David Thewlis is in this and then Paul Bettany goes batshit insane)
* and then there're all of the Guy Ritchie action films that can be hit or miss
* and I'm assuming you've seen **Shaun of the Dead**

Misc:


* **The Secret of Kells** (tech Irish not British, animated film... a bit simple on the plot but gorgeous artwork

Today I was sitting in my office when one of my officers attempted to assassinate me. Just then a British police box burst through the window containing some very odd characters.

I thought I would die in there and if it hadn't been for the bravery of Lt. Heinz Schmidt, I may have perished in there.

It has Time Lords and Gallifrey and working with UNIT, and all that, instead of knocking around randomly getting into trouble and an awful lot of running. The Doctor's character to me just wouldn't feel right with an old man. For one, especially the First Doctor doesn't look like he *could* run. And while the old series had that larger than life quality, there wasn't any of that ""Fury of the Time Lord"" feel. Trying to watch some of the old stuff, it just feels so cheap and lame and blah.

Also, from what I can tell (from the TARDIS File) the Draconians call him The Oncoming Storm not so much because he destroys everything he touches on purpose, but because wherever he goes, he destroys everything he touches because he's a menace. And in the new series, the Daleks call him that because he repeatedly genocides them.

I don't know much about the old series, but that kind of attitude is what I really love about the new series. That The Doctor is this Lonely God. It feels like he's always been something special. I mean, I get that feeling from what I've read about the old ones, but they really play it up here. Which *I* at least do love. And now at least he does have the most powerful ship in the universe connected to him symbiotically. As far as I can tell, the thing that powered *all* TARDISes is now singularly powering his.

It only seems that way because he was played by older actors. Consider that when we first meet the Doctor, he's actually much younger than he was when he joined Amy and Rory for Christmas dinner. 

&gt;It has Time Lords and Gallifrey and working with UNIT, and all that, instead of knocking around randomly getting into trouble and an awful lot of running

Well, not always. 1 never dealt with the Time Lords, Gallifrey or UNIT, 2 dealt with them only once or twice. 7 never had any dealings with them, either. 

&gt;there wasn't any of that ""Fury of the Time Lord"" feel. 

The invention of the Doctor as some sort of avenging god is interesting; but, similar to how you don't find the original take of him as just a traveler and a wanderer appealing, sometimes the depiction of the Time Lord Victorious doesn't always work, either. I thought Moffat did a great job of pointing out the disparity in ""A Good Man Goes To War"". 

You may find it interesting that the Seventh Doctor once told Davros that he was ""far more than 'just another Time Lord'""*. What he precisely meant by this, I hope we never know. 

*This was right before he destroyed Skaro and wiped out the entire Dalek race in ""Remembrance of the Daleks"". And he did it without shedding a tear or batting an eye. That's pretty Time Lord Furious.

* Rose - because it's the first one, duh
* End of the World - It's okay, not great
* Unquiet Dead - Explains the rift, meets Charles Dickens, pretty decent, and a bit spooky
* Aliens of London/World War Three - Watch the first... let's say ten minutes. You're introduced to Harriett Jones (MP of Flydale North, currently our Reddit Alien), and some good plot with Mickey and Jackie. Unfortunately there's: Fat farty aliens who want to destroy the earth for stupid reasons, a pig in a space suit, a dumb premise, fat farty aliens destroyed by vinegar, and [fucking this](http://images.wikia.com/tardis/images/5/55/Who01_mq_093cd-1-.jpg). Plastic Mickey was the dumbest thing ever. Oh, and the trash can eats him. 
* Dalek - Great episode. From here on out, they're good.
* The Long Game - Adam's an idiot, everything is fake news, the extras are annoying; but Simon Pegg is in it and he's great. Also sets up the last episode.
* Father's Day - first episode I saw. It's a bottle episode in Doctor Who, and it's good. I like Jackie and Pete interacting together.
* The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - One of the best stories of the new season, and definitely the best one in season 1.
* Boom Town - Return of the farty aliens, but actually still pretty good. Just got done watching it earlier today. It does for Aliens of London/World War Three what *The Two Thrones* did for *Warrior Within*, albeit not as well. Still it was a nice episode. And had more Jack. And Mickey and Rose.
* Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways - Hurr durr future Big Brother. But despite that, it's good. The Doctor gets to show off more of that fire and fury against one of his oldest enemies.

I had similar reservations when I set about re-discovering the classic series. But I found the stories (generally) so awesome that I it became easy to overlook the camp and questionable special effects. I mean, yes, a number of elements of the classic series haven't aged well; but it obviously did enough for there to be a revival, let alone a successful revival. 

&gt;  Running around, shimmying down pipes, hitting people on the head with serving trays, crouching, running for their lives. I mean, I've seen Pertwee punching people and doing space judo, but for the most part One, Two, Three, and Seven look like they might break a hip. And Seven kind of looks like he'd turn you down for a bank loan that would save your house.

2, 3 and 7 do plenty of running. 7 is gold in my book because he's so innocuous. You'd think he'd turn you down for a bank loan that would save your house. You trudge back home, despondent, only to find that he blew your house up while you were talking to him.

Perhaps you're more used to the physical, almost slapstick comedy of the new series?  

&gt;As for the ""not just another Timelord"" thing, apparently it was part of some Cartmel Masterplan that was expanded on in the New Virgin Adventures, and involves Lungbarrow. Every time I see something about Lungbarrow on the TARDIS File or Wikipedia, I ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist, because it's stupid.

I know, I'm well aware of the Cartmen Masterplan and the *Lungbarrow* ideas. I was pointing out that the idea of there being more to the Doctor was birthed in the classic series. It's not a revival invention.

&gt;Who decides to call a general election?

&gt;After the Fixed Term Parliament Act was passed on 15 September 2011, the date of the next general election is set as 7 May 2015. The Act provides for general elections to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years. There are two provisions that trigger an election other than at five year intervals:

&gt;1. A motion of no confidence is passed in Her Majesty's Government by a simple majority and 14 days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed

&gt;2. A motion for a general election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats (currently 434 out of 650)

&gt;Before this Act, the duration of a Parliament was set at a maximum of five years, although many were dissolved before that. The decision to call a general election was made by the Prime Minister by asking the Queen to dissolve Parliament.

From here: http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/elections-faq-page/

Heh, I've spent a year being angry about this, but it seems my ire was entirely misplaced. The Tories have 42% of the seats in parliament (307/650), for reference, so are way short of the second provision (even with the Lib Dems 57 seats they're only just over 50%).

The identity politics that started dominating the debate removed much of its power. Combating the inherent 'misogyny' and 'petty-racism' became such an easy way to continue the sectarianism. 

I am a strong believer that any radical Socialist movement can only be driven by the working classes. It cannot be White Knighted by left leaning middle classes. I'm also convinced that it would need to revolutionary rather than reformative in nature to really hold the 'right' to task.

My socialism is still very basic. I simply cannot accept that the fairest use of the the planets resources is to hand them to the monster that has grown into global capitalism. I can see the logistical arguments and I can understand (but not agree with) the moral arguments, but I've never been able to get past my simple view that we're letting the most predatory and sociopathic of our species dominate. I think this is why the world-analysis of the chomskyites is very appealing and on-the-nose to many... yet it comes with no practical solution.

We tick tock our way to a point where we simply cannot suffer the bastards anymore and have some sort of upheaval that results in a partial reset. 

Everything is luke warm and 'meh' for the 'middle classes' that dominate UK life. Most of us are less than 4 weeks pay from total collapse. Those with 'savings' and 'mortgages' are in such utter fear of losing them that they've constructed some kind of image of what is 'good' working class that they might be able to land softly into... just not that 'bad' working class... you know the ones I mean... the ones that 'just aren't helping'.

We seem to sate ourselves by having a yearly outrage that gets beaten to death and we all feel like 'somethings being done'... all-the-while the role of seeking out the common good is easily swapped out with 'cost-effectiveness' and 'value to the taxpayer'.

It's all nice and warm and sticky... but its ultimately turning government and its leaders into 'managers'.

When you have a person that has never worked then I can see the merit of this, but if you are looking at encouraging people to work would it not be better to give them jobseekers and a wage from the company (maybe at half minimum wage) as an extra £30 or so a week (tax free and not to be applied against housing or council tax benefits) would be a more positive experience than doing a 40 hour week for no perceivable benefit.  

We must move away from the concept of the listless poor, which does belong back in the 19th century.  People will work and improve if they can, but so long as society and government is principle controlled by those that have no real experience of poverty the lie remains that people on benefits need moral guidance, they don’t they need jobs, money and opportunities and when they work hard they need to be rewarded. 

This is from a person that has lived in absolute poverty and now just lives in poverty.

Something like 40% of the US health care budget is spent on bureaucracy. Another 25% on law suits. France spends massive amounts on working out what is entitled by the state and what needs to be paid for. Then spends a whole lot more because their investment in preventative care is lower. Disaster based health care is more profitable and private health systems nearly always tend towards it. Every single private health service on the planet is less efficient than our national health service. No matter what fat cat middle managers exist. Do you honestly think there are no middle managers in private companies?

The exact same has happened now that we've made universities entirely student funded. The cost of actually working out who is or isn't entitled to help, managing the debt and the losses when students eventually go past 35 years without fully paying it off is expected to be higher than the cost of just paying for the universities directly.

At some point, you have to look at things and ask what social outcomes you think are desirable, and then just apply the system that best meets those outcomes.  I think that a tax-funded healthcare system results in better overall outcomes than the private alternative, largely because I think that the benefits of healthcare are widely spread among society in general (people not being off work, herd immunity, stopping the spread of contagious diseases...).  For university education, I think the best overall outcomes generally come from private funding in a broadly competitive market, but only if the government intervenes to reduce the barriers to entry (basically upfront payments) and reduce the debt risk.  In the same way, I think that saucepan production is best served by a free market and that railways are arguably best funded through taxation and central oversight.  
  
I appreciate that my position on any given issue won't be shared by everybody, but my argument in no way comes from a position of 'I have mine so why should I pay for yours'.  I generally try to approach things from a utilitarian point of view.

And as I've just replied to him (only reposting it here in case you don't read his answer again), if somebody goes off to become a surveyor and you benefit by having a house surveyed, you pay for that at the time.  The surveyor is benefiting by having you pay him, so why should you also pay for him to learn the skill that he's then turning round and selling to you?

However I don't understand how you can imply Church, or people like her, are ""moaning"". As a point of interest [I recommend watching her full testimony to Leveson, if you haven't,](http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/hearing/2011-11-28pm/) (She's first up), just to hear the kind of thing she was subjected to.

With regards to ""you're going to get burnt, it's how the press works"": Isn't that the whole point of the Leveson inquiry! Much of the evidence that I've heard (dipping in and out over the weeks) implies that 'celebs' are being used and manipulated without any control over it at all. Having heard some cases from the 'horses mouths', I've had to question some of my opinions on people even though I've never actually read that particular area of the press or taken much interest in celebrity life. I don't mean to say I believe everything I've heard or read in the past in or about news paper stories, but when there's a constant background noise of ""X doing Y"" and if you can't be sure where you're hearing all the things (it fades from memory) then you're left with a sense of ""X isn't such a nice person."" 

Consider Chris Jefferies (not a celeb but a good example): All those different newspapers doing after him probably left a huge number of people thinking ""There must be something in it."" While I agree some celebrities use the press to their advantage, the amount of intrusion or attention they receive along with it, isn't justified. Also I would argue that a good deal of the attention that is labelled under ""PR"" is very often the papers themselves stirring the pot.

For example with regards to Church: Can you be sure what stories you've read or heard about that *were* legitimate PR, or leaked PR, compared to 'salacious gossip' generated by the press?  As Church herself said after the settlement on Monday (paraphrase - can't find the quote): ""...there was a story about me every week in the NotW for months and months...""

I certainly don't know which stories were put there by whom, which is why I question what ""celebs"" should have know better.

Celebrity and gossip columnists get all of their leads from PR's, it's how they get all of those exclusives, they also, of course, get a lot of material from people trying to sell them stories like, say a jilted ex or a not so trustworthy acquaintance trying to make some easy money. Fashion journalists are exactly the same, it too comes from PR companies. Investigative journalists do their own research but people ring them up and give them leads and exclusives in the same way. Major news stories obviously come from places like  [PA,](http://www.pressassociation.com/)  journalists in the field and other specialist PR companies. 

There's a lot of PR companies out there doing this. 

At the News of the World though I can imagine there was a lot of ""Ask no questions"" and backhander shit going on. In fact it's pretty obvious that this was the case. 

The industry has changed though, I've read a whole load of legal memos my girl gets telling news staff in no uncertain words that these practices are now strictly forbidden.

Dear David Cameron,

I do not wish for Private Enterprise to compete with any part of the National Health Service, I believe in the long term this will lead to the detriment of the service.

I hope that you haven't supported this bill, if so then I will definitely not vote for you in the next election, local or general and I will inform my local colleagues, friends and family about the negative effects that having such health care can have. There is a reason Britain has such a brilliant reputation for its Health Care due to it being unbiased, fair and supporting of everyone.

What is your personal and professional opinion on this bill? Are you in support?

I fear that if this is taken over by corporations such a brilliant system will be lost.

The NHS is an institution that I wholly suppport, if you hand this over to private enterprise I will not vote for you again.

Yours sincereley,

Opinion. They *are* continuing with the PFI initiative disaster that Labour was such a big fan of, but what *exactly* does ""make our healthcare go more privatised"" mean?

False. People are not going to *made* to work for free in order to get benefits, it's voluntary. On top of that, some of the major participants, such as Tesco, have stated that they will pay the minimum wage anyway.

Costs abroad:

£2250 for three years tuition.(@£750, which is pretty difficult to find).

Costs at home: (8800/year [something like the average])

£26400 before interest.

Using the figures here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/q9y8b/university_education_will_be_beyond_the_reach_of/c3vyjek

and here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/q9y8b/university_education_will_be_beyond_the_reach_of/c3vykzj

So we're using a £42k average for thirty years, at 4.3%.

(42000*.043*30)= £54180.

So you will pay around 24 times less by going abroad, receive a similar level of education (assuming you choose one of the big recognisable universities abroad with a good reputation like Maastricht or Technical University Munich). 

While learning a new language is difficult, pretty much everyone else in europe manages to do so. It is painfully embarrassing how monolingual the UK is. At the end of it learning another language is probably something else you can put down on your CV so you have added employability that way too.

With flights to europe now less expensive than train travel in this country, I dont see how it would be difficult to keep in touch with family and friends.

&gt;He added however that many students were looking at universities which were not necessarily cheaper, but which offered what students saw as an improved lifestyle and better quality education than that available in Britain for a similar cost.

&gt;“Students seem to think that if you're going to spend £9,000 a year to study in an average British city, you might as well spend the same amount and go somewhere like Perth, where there's a great beachside lifestye and really good facilities, especially for sport, "" he said. ""Students also say they are attracted to the different content of foreign degrees, where they get more of a chance to take modules in a range of subjects.""

&gt;Mr Raimo added in the current economic climate, studying abroad was also likely to improve students' chances in the job market. “Britain's mass education system makes it difficult for students with degrees to differentiate themselves in a marketplace. If they've studied abroad, however, they look much more independent, and have learnt important new skills, like languages.""

true,back-in-black,english,England,"That could all have been my life story right up until the point where you decided to do History at University. 

When I was 16, I was thinking of taking History and English rather than sciences, and then I talked to my parents, who sensibly pointed out that ""If you do History at University you'll never get a job"". So I went the Science route instead and did science A-levels followed by a degree in Biochemistry. I worked my arse off both academically and to pay rent, and at the end of it all I was sick of being poor, sick of examinations, and thoroughly sick of my subject.

After graduating, I had the same problem as you. We were told there was going to be a revolution in biotechnology, but it just didn't seem to happen, and after being unemployed for a while I stated to think about which *profession* I wanted to move in to, as the crappy administrative and temp jobs I ended up in never lasted long, or paid very much. Eventually I picked IT, and did a conversion course, before being unemployed *again* after graduating at the tail end of the dot com crash. 

Eventually, I worked for free for a small company, and on my own projects, until I had enough experience that another prospective employer was willing to take a chance on me, and everything finally paid off... at the grand old age of 26.

So, I will grant you that its very difficult. But it's not impossible. You made a very poor choice in your degree, as the only thing most people can use History for is for becoming a Historian, or doing a conversion course for something like Law. I'm afraid you have to suffer crappy jobs whilst you sort out which profession you want to join (do *not* expect anything from working in Tesco, behind a bar, or doing clerical work, they are all dead ends), and think about how you can get there from where you are now. 

The fact that this country expects everyone to have a degree, and 1 years worth of commercial experience before being handed a ""white collar"" job is insane. As is the fact that we're sending 50% of the population to Uni, who then have expectations of getting a ""better"" job afterwards, which appears to be true only for a minority. We could afford to have cheaper Universities when only an academic elite attended, but it looks like we are on a long road to more degrees costing more money, mandatory for more people, for no discernible reason. 

Degrees should come with a disclaimer attached at the end, and it should read like this:

But there are a good few quintessentially British films that just wouldn't work anywhere else, and really give an insight to British life, some of which have also been mentioned and I can add my recommendations to: Trainspotting, Withnail and I, Full Monty, A Clockwork Orange.

A couple more which seem to have been missed:

- **Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels** - The first of the London cockney gangster films, and probably still the best.

- **Snatch** - Yes, it has Brad Pitt, but this is incredibly British. Gypsies, diamonds, boxing, the lot. And Statham, glorious glorious Statham.

- **All Or Nothing** - An incredible slow-burner of a film. Mike Leigh's masterpiece, for me. A stunning portrait of early '00s working class life, and some great characters.

- **Vera Drake** - Another Mike Leigh film set amongst the working class, but this time during WWII Blitz-era London. Subtle, but powerful.

- **Kidulthood** - You might need a translator for some of the language, but this a great example of teenagers making the transition to adulthood, usually via gangs and violence.

- **Football Factory** and **Green Street** - I'll lump these two in together because they're very similar examinations of football hooligans and violence. FF is probably the better one, and you'll discover the joys of Danny ""greatest living English actor"" Dyer.

- the **Monty Python** films - Utter, utter genius, and stark raving mad. Life of Brian is probably the most accessible, but Holy Grail is their masterpiece.

- **Tristram Shandy** - Someone mentioned this below, but I'd advise reading the book first, because the film is very true to its nature, if not its story (not that there is much of one anyway).

&gt;There are no tuition fees for attending public higher education in Norway, as all the costs are covered by the Ministry of Education and Research.

&gt;Students are also given the opportunity to apply for financial support (a part loan/part grant) from the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund. The main requirement for support from Fund is that you are a Norwegian citizen. However, foreign citizens may also be entitled to financial support.[3]

&gt;Eligible applicants may be granted financial support (a part loan/part grant) of about NOK 90,000. It is initially given as a full loan, but upon completion of modules in the education around 40 percent of the amount is transferred to a scholarship/grant if the modules are passed. There is no interest paid while taking the education.

Germany:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany

GINI score: 27
HDI: 9th
Tax as % of GDP: 40.1%.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany#Tuition_fees

&gt;Most colleges are state-funded. In 2010, five of the 16 states of Germany charged tuition fees at state-funded colleges, while in 11 states tuition was provided free of charge. There are no university-sponsored scholarships in Germany, but a number of private and public institutions award scholarships, usually to cover living costs and books.

France

GINI: 27
% of Tax/GDP: 44.6%
HDI: 20th

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_france#Tuition_costs

&gt;Since higher education is funded by the state, the fees are very low; the tuition varies from 150€ to 700€ depending on the university and the different levels of education. (licence, master, doctorate). **One can therefore get a Master's degree (in 5 years) for about 750-3,500€.** Additionally, students from low-income families can apply for scholarships, paying nominal sums for tuition or textbooks, and can receive a monthly stipend of up to 450€/month.

Austria:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria

GINI: 26
HDI: 19th
%GDP tax: 43.4%.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Austria

&gt;The country’s university system was free until 2001, since then studies have been subject to fees. (€366 per term for Austrian citizens, about €700 per term for non-Austrians). In 2008 however, the government has decided to again eliminate the fees for students who complete their studies in the minimum time and are EU/EEA citizens.

Denmark:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark

GINI: Score of 24.7, Ranked 1st.
HDI: 19th.
%tax/GDP: 49%

&gt;Almost all educational institutes in Denmark are free. This tuition-less system applies to all students:
who have been born in Denmark;
who hold a permanent resident visa;
who hold a humanitarian visa;
from countries in the Nordic Council;
from countries in the European Economic Area or European Union.

Italy

GINI score: 32
HDI: 24th
%tax/GDP: 42.6

Wikipedia doesnt have a page that deals with HE in italy.

http://www.studyabroaduniversities.com/Cost-of-Study-and-Living-in-Italy.aspx

&gt;The average fees a student has to pay is somewhere between 850 euro and 1,000 euro per year since this varies from one university to another and also depends on the chosen course of study. Private universities are clearly much more expensive.

Netherlands

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands

GINI score: 30.9
HDI: ranked 3rd.
%tax/GDP: 39.8

Again, no clear wiki reference for fees.

http://www.studyineurope.eu/study-in-the-netherlands/admission/tuition-fees

EU students can expect to pay around €1600-1900 per year.

Sweden

There is definitely less government funding now, they have cut the teaching grant given to universities enormously, hence universities having to raise fees to cover the deficit.

&gt;The savings to government won't be felt for years - decades even. The difference between the full cost and the amount paid back by graduates is, I believe, a socially beneficial cost for which tax funding is entirely justified, as it can be seen as the price of reducing the barriers to entering university.

But will there be any savings? if there is a deficit at the end of 30 yrs or so with loans being written off. I maybe being extremely dim here, but I just don't see how that works long term. Just as well I studied science and not economics... :-)

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Sorry, I should have worded it differently - I know you weren't arguing that this scenario/these practices was/are 'OK'. However I don't understand how you can imply Church, or people like her, are ""moaning"". As a point of interest I recommend watching her full testimony to Leveson, if you haven't, (She's first up), just to hear the kind of thing she was subjected to.

I have been watching it, and it has been horrendous what Church and others have had to go through. And no I do not agree with how the press act, it isn't fair and new laws need to be brought in and regulated.  But I really can't find much sympathy. If you don't want that sort of life, don't become a celeb, don't use a PR company that promotes you everywhere and don't use the media to further your career. I know it sounds harsh, but I do regard the celeb culture as somewhat of a cancer on our society, it fills the media and detracts away from what is important and what should be reported. 

&gt;With regards to ""you're going to get burnt, it's how the press works"": Isn't that the whole point of the Leveson inquiry! Much of the evidence that I've heard (dipping in and out over the weeks) implies that 'celebs' are being used and manipulated without any control over it at all. Having heard some cases from the 'horses mouths', I've had to question some of my opinions on people even though I've never actually read that particular area of the press or taken much interest in celebrity life. I don't mean to say I believe everything I've heard or read in the past in or about news paper stories, but when there's a constant background noise of ""X doing Y"" and if you can't be sure where you're hearing all the things (it fades from memory) then you're left with a sense of ""X isn't such a nice person."" 

All I can say to that is that I accept that point, it would be unfair of me to say much else because I really don't follow the media or celeb gossips, so difficult for me to say 'well I need to think again if that is true about X and Y' because I wouldn't know anything in the first place! :-) 

&gt;Consider Chris Jefferies (not a celeb but a good example): All those different newspapers doing after him probably left a huge number of people thinking ""There must be something in it."" While I agree some celebrities use the press to their advantage, the amount of intrusion or attention they receive along with it, isn't justified. Also I would argue that a good deal of the attention that is labelled under ""PR"" is very often the papers themselves stirring the pot.

Absolutely spot on, and with that I could not agree more. Than man did not ask for the press intrusion in his life, and no doubt it has left its mark. I feel real genuine sympathy for him, and those like him who have been forced into the limelight by anothers crime. But again he isn't a celeb, he didn't appear on x-factor or kick a football about for an obscene wage. I do agree with your point that the amount of intrusion *anyone* has to suffer at the hands of the press is wrong, I really don't find much sympathy for people who have put themselves there in the first place. They know what it will be like, doesn't mean they should put up with it, or that it is right but even so.

The strike is only idiotic if it harms the union by losing support, as pointed out by chenobble above

If the threat of a strike and the disruption and negative way that this will reflect on the country at a time when the world is focused on it, is not enough to make the public and private sector pay attention to how seriously unfair people consider proposed changes to be then maybe the negative attention is deserved.

Obviously no one intentionally wants to make the country look bad for the sake of doing so, but the fact that they are prepared to should be indicative of how serious the opposition to the proposed changes is, it should not be seen as selfish and needlessly disruptive

All you're showing me is that countries with free education often have a better GINI than those without, however that's not proof that free education results in a 'much better society'.

For example, according to OECD the top 10 most expensive countries for university education are (in order, I've put their gini scores next to them):

United States @ 48.6%

Korea @ 31.5%

UK @ 34.5%

Japan @ 32.9%

Australia @ 33.6%

Canada @ 32.4%

New Zealand @ 33%

Netherlands @ 29.4%

Portugal @ 35.3%

Italy @ 33.7

As you can see, there's not even a strong correlation between high cost of university and a better GINI.

Socialism, in political science, has a very specific meaning. It is the transition government that comes after a communist revolution, but before communism. It involves a ruling council apportioning resources, to prepare the ground for a leaderless communist society.

That makes it true when you say no socialist government has worked; revolutions have always got snagged on a stage that's meant to be temporary.

However, you are confusing that kind of socialism with what is actually social democracy, which is a form of government that involves a large welfare state, big government and lots of equality.

It's a form of government that works beautifully across Scandinavia, and relatively well in France. In other places too. It would work here, if we let it.

I know how markets work, thanks. I also know that they don't work very well, because recessions keep happening. I do not recognise un- or partially regulated markets as being better than the socialism that you denigrate. It clearly leads to boom, bust, inequality and suffering. 

And the people who took out the loans are not as culpable as the financiers who offered them and the governments who didn't audit them. These loans were often sold outright fraudulently; at best, they were highly misrepresented. One guy taking out a bad mortgage doesn't crash an economy, but one mortgage lender lending out thousands of bad mortgages did.

These lenders knew what they were doing when they made these deals: misleading clients who had no hope of surviving toxic debt. They are therefore mostly to blame.

Bankers aren't sorting any economy out. Financial services do not employ many people, and do not create that much money. Britain's atrophied manufacturing sector contributes as much as double to the economy as our financial sector. The way to get the economy moving is to put money in the pockets of lots of poor people, who will go out and spend it all. Putting lots of money in the pockets of a few of the rich doesn't have the same effect.
