No-one was physically harmed and given that it appears to be the ravings of a disturbed man who isn't a real threat, it's unlikely that anyone would have been harmed.  Rape and murder are ""very serious crimes"", I think this is more of a public nuisance]",0,1339562180,null,0,1339575203,0,c4zw8bb,t3_uypb6,t1_c4zw8bb,t3_uypb6,null,1429131046,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"A credible death threat is serious, yes.  My feeling (admittedly based only on what I read in the article) is that this guy is a bit of a nutter and as such, probably not really a realistic threat.  He's certainly a nuisance, perhaps even a public menace and I'm not against him being punished and/or having a restraining order placed against him.  If he does have mental health issues then I'd rather see ""the system"" try and help him get better instead of punishing him for actions that may be largely beyond his rational control.

But one way or another, I don't consider this to be a ""very serious crime"".

It was at worst a shallow threat to commit a very serious crime.  The fact that the man is agoraphobic suggests that the chances of him actually venturing outside of his house to kidnap one of Mensch's children are pretty slim.  He's a nuisance, not a killer.  I suspect that the police, lawyers, judges and the targets themselves are all well aware of that fact.  But they're using this opportunity (in the form of the new communications act, or whatever it's called) to throw the book at him.

As I say, that's all based on speculation.  I'm not a lawyer and I haven't heard all the evidence, so there might be more to it.  But based on what's been presented, I can't agree with the judge's choice of words.  No blood has been spilled and no property has been stolen or damaged.  I fail to see how it can be categorised as a ""very serious crime"".

In such situations, a yearly lease is actually a good thing as it motivates tenant and landlord to behave.

It may be possible that someone like the CAB will be able to intercede on your behalf with the supplier and defer the disconnection - but unless the landlord starts paying the bills, then the supply will be cut off eventually.

You are entitled to your opinion but you should also expect it to be examined and criticised if others think it's wrong. I think you're wrong because you are failing to take into account the harm caused by what you consider to be an idle threat.

Imagine the MP was campaigning for an election and knocked on this mans door to gain support. When he opened the door it may become clear that he was suffering from a mental condition. Imagine if he then said ""I'm not supporting you and I'm going to get my mates to photograph your kids and we'll get one of them"". Due to the circumstances it would probably not be taken seriously, the Police would have a quiet word and no further action would be taken. No real harm would have been caused by the idle threat.

In the circumstances in the report I'd say that real harm was caused due to the nature and delivery method of the threat. The MP's children were threatened anonymously via e-mail at her home or office. She didn't know who sent the message or how seriously to take it. She didn't know it was a 60 year old troll with a possible mental illness - it could have been a real, serious threat. The natural position would be to take it very seriously. From that moment on, until the defendant was traced and caught real harm was being done to her and her family - they had received anonymous death threats to their children.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Your argument here isn't sound. 

How?

&gt;The burden of proof is always with the claimant, he who is insisting on some truth.

So prove your 'claim'. I've provided evidence of how the royals are indeed popular. You've provided *zero*, and you haven't demonstrated how their popularity doesn't increase site visits either. Mention philosophy as many times as you like, you don't get to assert that your opinion alone = truth until someone else proves otherwise, certainly not when they've given you information that you have no real data to reply with or base your assertion on.

&gt;It is unfair for that person to turn around and say 'I am correct until you prove me wrong'.

Apart from when you do it, it would appear.

&gt;One fundamental rule is the burden of proof. 

Which has been supplied, or rather enough has been supplied for your assertions not to be taken at face value. Ignore/ attempt to dismiss it if you like, but you're still then arguing from a a position of no evidence of your own.

&gt; court cannot assert guilt based on the fact that the defendant could not prove he wasn't there.

And if an attraction published an advert stating that another attraction had no interest for tourists, and was taken to court, they'd have to prove this. You *are* the attraction making that claim, so provide your proof.

&gt;in this argument you are the prosecution's equivalent because you are supporting the truth claim: the ruling monarch is a significant draw of tourism. 

With no evidence to the contrary, what would you expect? And in any case, you're only asserting that I'm the prosecution, based on (I guess) the fact that I don't automatically agree with your assertions.

&gt;The prosecution has the burden of proof

I'm the *jury* - you've demonstrated and stated bias, but I could be swayed either way; I didn't start from a clearly-defined pre-existing opinion such as yours. However, the first site I found looking into this provided statistics and surveys to the contrary of your statements that, no matter how much you attempt to dismiss them, are still 100% more evidence than you've introduced to support your opinion. That's how it works when you post assertions with no actual facts to back you up - it's *not* everyone else's job to do the work for you.

&gt;The evidence you present is terribly weak and a single advertisement on a non-scientific website

Well, if it's that easy to disprove, let's see *your* survery of 25,000.

&gt;You are obliged to provide more evidence

Actually, that's now your job. Attack the website/ survery/ statistics all you like, it doesn't change things until you've presented some of your own.

&gt;presumably you have more evidence otherwise you are guilty of committing the sin of pushing a 'predefined opinion'.

I honestly don't know if there are any more sites, because I'm not going to bother googling any more until you've presented some of your own. I haven't layed out my grand pro-royal stance in the way you have with your position, because I didn't have a particularly strong opinion about it beforehand. The fact that you're quite happy to repeatedly demand more evidence before providing any of your own, several times, to the point of accusing me of a predefined opinion unless I supply links until *you* are satisfied speaks volumes about how much of your outlook is down to your opinion and nothing to do with actual proof (of which you've provided none). You're quite happy to mention courts and philosophy; you've got to learn that this doesn't mean talking to people on reddit as if they're a lecturer, demanding that your own work be done for you.

&gt; If one link lacking context and detail,

It had enough to dispute your assertion - but feel free to provide evidence to the contrary.

&gt;that talks about a survey yet denies you access to the full results, is enough evidence for certainty then it smacks of at least laziness. 

Yes, you'd have though someone would have provided statistics or surveys to the contrary by now. Since, y'know, it's apparently so easy to disprove.

&gt;People have said your evidence is weak

One or two, and there's at least one secondary-account (another example of anything-but-evidence) in there. That's not really the same as saying 'people'. And they can say whatever they like - but they have to back it up for it to count. The fact that *nobody* has done this in two seperate threads says a lot in itself, and that's before we get to the OP posting this question because he couldn't be bothered to google for evidence to back his assumptions himself in another thread, resorting to abuse when he failed to provide any evidence at all.

&gt;and your response is to duck out telling others it is up to them to prove you wrong.

Yeah, demanding that others practice what they preach is really annoying, isn't it?

&gt;The absence of evidence does just that

Indeed it does. You've seen mine. Let's see yours.

My last point would be if the average CofE member is so much more liberal than the world wide Episcopal churches then why is a schism a bad thing. An organization that claims to be about the love of god but spends its time denying others the right to love in the way they see fit because of some other churches in its umbrella group is quite morally bankrupt.

Our failures this year have been as much rooted in circumstance as Redknapp's decisions - a disruptive courtcase that should never have been and kept him away from the squad during a crucial period, the England manager situation which was left to hang over us without ever being resolved, a season long injury crisis that deprived us of many good players and made it difficult to rotate the team, particularly in the first half of the season (even if we all suspect he wouldn't have done so anyway).

Not to mention a chairman who despite almost universal praise from our fanbase has for the last couple of years been notably shy of investing in the squad and has done a slow job of cutting out some of the deadwood that's been hanging around.

But many of the decisions he has made have pissed me off and I'm not sure he's tactically capable of overseeing us compete with the big clubs as a big club. I hate how wedded he seems to his first XI+2 if we're lucky and I don't think you can succeed like that in the modern game - we're not Villa and it's not the 1981. We've had some very good players that I think we can all agree haven't seen enough time on the pitch over the last couple of years, and some even better players who've seen too much time on the pitch for their own good.

Ideally he would be offered a big contract somewhere else that he couldn't turn down and Levy would let him go without demanding compensation, seeing us amicably part ways with fond memories and minimal disruption to the team. Preferably before the Euros finish.

The IP address is a unique identifier that rather than being assigned PER PC these days is assigned PER ROUTER / MODEM.

That is to say - the external IP your flatmate had in student halls (the one they will have seen if he torrented anything) will have been the same IP EVERYONE that router served had, which is why it's so hard to catch ANYONE on campus doing this kind of thing unless they have competant techs, which practically none of them do. Aside from the obvious caveat below, I can't imagine police dedicating resources to nabbing every student that comes out of a particular hall, then examining their machines for pirated content.

If you have moved and for example set up a Sky ADSL connection at home, there is utterly ZERO chance that he has the same IP address. On top of it not working like that, there's no way they'd let an academic range IP (universities usually have their own IP ranges) transfer to a private household outside school grounds.

We should close business loopholes, and reclaim billions which they owe.

Cut wasteful spending. Spending goes UP every single year, and it's crazy.

Moderate tax raises on the actual wealthy (i.e. those with an income of over £300,000/yr) to pay for some of it. Spending cuts to fund the rest. Let people keep more of their own money and let them decide how to spend it.

There's this system of benefits called Basic Income Guaranteed. Everyone gets a basic wage, enough to live on, and then if you get a job you're taxed in such a way so the basic wage slowly decreases. So if you're earning a lot, you're taxed so you don't get the basic wage (it cuts out all the bureaucracy anyway).

Anyway they tried this system out in a canadian town and found the only people who worked less were students and pregnant women.

Our losses and draws were because of a lack of tactical identity, a lack of a gameplan, and a lack of shape.  Honestly, the best thing I saw Redknapp try all year was the 3-5-2 with Bale and Walker as wingbacks, but we never saw it again.

On top of that, his transfer tactics are pretty awful.  Barring Scott Parker (Blessed be his name), transfers for 30+ players are a terrible idea.  I know it's hard to say who exactly wanted a player, with the way Spurs management is set up, but whenever I hear a quote from him about a player he likes, it's usually someone I would consider to be on the decline.

We need a manager who will tell Bale to stay on the fucking left flank against better teams, and one with enough gravitas that Bale would listen.

It's not that I don't like Harry.  I want him to be the England manager, and win the World Cup.  Really, this is all John Terry's fault via Capello resigning early.  If Capello leaves after Euros as planned, Redknapp slots in perfectly with no letdown in Spurs 11/12 season.",0,1339592493,null,0,false,0,c4zzvet,t3_uzjjy,t1_c4zzvet,t3_uzjjy,null,1429132770,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

We're back to the logic that would actually invalidate most of the entries in that list, are we?

&gt;picking Elizabeth Windsor as a postcard is irrelevant to the question: what proportion of tourists wouldn't visit Britain if the monarchy ended? 

How is it irrelevant? I'll say it *again*, since you both seem to forget the stuff that's inconvenient or not in line with your opinions - it demonstrates that the royals are popular, and considering popularity = $, you have to demonstrate how the royals' populairty *in no way* affects the number of visitors to the associated sites.

&gt;Your whole argument hinges on postcards. 

No, it hinges on a survey of 25,000 demonstrating popularity. Your whole argument hinges on nothing more than your opinion and speculation. I'll move onto other evidence when you've actually presented....well, any.

&gt;If you can't understand how terrible that is please don't ever accept jury duty. 

Why, would you expect me to convict based on no evidence whatsoever, solely on one persons' opinion? Made even worse when evidence is produced and belittled, ignored by not proven wrong with anything in return? Not sure what jury you've been on, but it cannot have been one in the UK.

Oh, absolutely it could not work. But I think the probability of getting back to the CL goes up once some older player come into the squad. It'd be tough going with just young guns. Newcastle I think were a bit of a flash in the pan. They won't contend for a CL deep into next season, I'm guessing. This season was them playing above themselves because as a young team they didn't know any better. They didn't know they we'rent supposed to be challenging for a top 4 spot, or they didn't care. I see that a lot in American sports. A young team playing out of their minds doing things no on thought they could. Usually then, the next season they come back to Earth a bit.

&gt;Again, a sentiment I've never understood. What effect does it have if people suddenly know ""we mean business""?

Really? If we start doing business right away, it shows ambition. It makes players at least be mindful of us all throughout the summer. The more times we're mentioned in the running for players, the easier it is to convince someone to sign. It's like advertising.

Moyes has a good reputation for doing lots with the little he's had at Everton, which is in large part down to his real eye for a bargain signing. While certainly a good thing in terms of considering him as a manager, this has meant his Everton squad has actually been pretty consistently high quality, and that makes it much harder to dismiss their consistently poor starts to the season - his Everton teams have had some pretty disasterous spells over the last couple of years that he hasn't been able to bring them out of for long periods.

That isn't an important reason for not hiring him however, I just thought it worth pointing out that even a manager as respected as him has a far from perfect record.

The reason not to think he should be the automatic choice should Redknapp go is that Moyes represent a wholesale change for the club - you couldn't pick a managerial philosophy more diametrically opposed to Redknapp's. I think it was Michael Cox who wrote a very good article for the Guardian contrasting the two a couple of months ago when everyone still expected Redknapp to leave for the England job. Do we really want to throw away everything we worked for (and succeeded with) under Redknapp for the last three and a half years?

I'd love to see Moyes get a chance at a bigger club capable of funding him better than Everton can, and if he comes in I'll be a hundred percent behind him, but I just don't think he and Spurs would be a good fit.

He admits to some damage (for instance, he acidentally cracked a kitchen benchtop with a hot pan), but he thinks they are being unreasonable about things like patches on the wall. In four years it's likely that the place would be due for a re-paint anyway, and they're trying to be cheeky and get him to pay for it.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I agree that ambition carries a degree of weight to it, and i think with us showing ambition and bringing in players like Vertongen (if we will ever get it done) and Remy/Damiao/Ba/Martin/Luuk De Jong/everyone else in europe shows that we want to be a consistent CL team.  This makes us more attractive to numerous players.

But, i wouldn't say its bullshit that we could lose these players.  While we are a team that is showing ambition and has been performing well we are still a team with a smaller bank account that is on the fringe of being an elite European team.  

Players like Modders, Bale, VDV want to play at an elite team not only for the recognition and competition but for the money.  We can't (as it currently stands) offer the money that teams like ManU, ManCity, Chelsea, Real, Barca, PSG, Inter, AC, Juve, even Malaga can. Even some of the other teams around europe that are on the same level as us can offer more in wages.

I don't want to lose any of the players (excluding a few of our fringe players), i think it would be a huge detriment to where we are as an organization. But at the same time being realistic, Bale is one of the hottest names in Europe and so far we have been able to hold onto him and he seems happy and i hope we do everything we can to ensure that it stays that way, but if a team like Real or PSG show up and offer us 50-60m for him and a contract that pays him 150-200K/wk well that is something that both sides would have to seriously consider doing, and at some point...someone will test us with a huge offer for Bale, they will show him how him a huge sum of money and see how he reacts, we need to be prepared for the eventuality and have a contingency plan in place should he say yes...thats not being negative its being smart.  

Rafa is someone i would love to keep, he seems to love Spurs, fan seem to love him, i get the impression that the team loves him as does management.  But if someone were to offer 12-16m on him, well then you have to look at it objectively...he is a 29 year old player that you would see a significant profit on moving on, a profit that you are less likely to see as much of as he gets older.  From a business standpoint it begins to weight in the direction to make the move and use those funds to get a similar player who is several years younger and potentially cheaper.

Again, i hope none of this happens (well, aside from bringing in Vertongen, Remy etc), i hope we can keep all these players, but i think we do need to be aware that we can lose them and make sure we are prepared that this could happen be it for business reasons, player dissatisfaction, or a new manager.",0,1339599001,null,0,false,0,c5013jw,t3_uzjjy,t1_c5013jw,t1_c500lm6,null,1429133346,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The problem was, we didn't but youngsters already at a high standard - Henderson wasn't ready to be a starting XI player in a top-4 challenging team, certainly not when played on the right, and while Carroll was playing at a high standard, it was a completely different system, and he had fitness issues. The prices paid didn't help.

On the other hand - and I know this is with hindsight - someone like Oxlade-Chamberlain has shown he's good enough to be playing regularly (not every week, but enough that he's not just a squad player) for a top 4 club. So it's not just ""don't sign young players, sign older ones"" - Downing and Cole are examples of that failing.

As for advertising, I'd argue Liverpool have plenty to advertise, even within our current squad. I think the advertising is more of an issue when a club is changing policy - e.g. Arsenal signing Podolski will help get older players to consider Arsenal, whereas earlier they might have thought ""they don't want me, I'm above 18"". 

I agree with the general principle of doing our business early, simply because we can get players before other teams come in and swoop for them. That probably would have happened this season, but the sackings of Comolli and Dalglish mean we have to start again.

So the link you insisted was trash earlier is now your only source of information? 

&gt;You haven't produced evidence.

Yes, I have.

&gt;A necessary correlation between the picking of postcards to increased international travel is non-existent.

So...you're suggesting that a survey of tourists favourite UK-centric postcard subjects has no connection to why people visit britain or what sites they go to when they do? Explain. Or provide *directly* contrary evidence.

&gt;Why are you measuring everything in dollars?

For fun. It's a sign for money.

&gt;A good royalist would at least use the pound sign. 

Well, how lucky for you that I'm not a good royalist. Or even a royalist. That's what happens when you guess at everything instead of finding out for yourself (in this case, by just asking). Why are you so keen on polarisation to the point of statements that aren't true? Does it somehow improve your assertions or add legitimacy to your apparently non-fact-based opinions? It ain't working :-)

&gt;Answer the following question: how many tourists wouldn't visit the Tower of London if the monarchy was removed?

You mean you haven't seen me address this elsewhere, more than once? At the risk of my opting to answer something you haven't said (since it seems to be a recurring trick in this thread), I've pointed out more than once that the ToL is a historic site, and like several of the others will *always* attract visitors - but that doesn't mean those numbers wouldn't change.

* No royal connection would mean less visitors, considering the royals are part of the attraction. Alternatively, it may not - but to make that view anything other than speculation, you'd have to illustrate that the royals' popularity means nothing in terms of where tourists visit in the UK...and to do that, you need to show how tourists are indifferent to the royals. Which part of this is so hard to comprehend?

* How far do you think you'd get applying this logic to the many *other* royal-related sites, instead of cherry-picking the ToL? The fact that you're doing this gives away more than you appear to realise (or admit).

* If we remove the royals as a needless cost, then what else gets removed? Do we *need* Beefeaters? Do we *need* the crown jewels? The ravens? And would removing any/ all of these mean anything to tourist visits either? How many *other* facets that only exist because of the royals would be removed as well? Now demonstrate how tourists don't come to see any of these things and therefore would make no difference either.

&gt;If the royals were that important why are there no royal sites in the top 10 tourist attractions?

And so we're back to complaining that because the royal sites aren't the top of the charts, then they mean nothing.  Repeat all these questions yet again if you like, but from this point on I'll just start cut'n'pasting the previous replies that were ignored unless you introduce any real information or surveys that show your opinion to be more than speculation.

Focus from an early age on relationships between teachers and students being built on mutual respect instead of fear. Make sure children understand why their education is important, and value their time spent at school. Invest money in paying for resources to ensure that the underlying problems of those who fall out of line are dealt with effectively.

Pay teachers more, so that the profession actually gets the best talent, and isn't considered a ""backup option"" for graduates who find themselves too incompetent or unmotivated to do anything else.

Place emphasis on language learning from an earlier age, in terms of kids actually being able to speak it competently, rather than the current joke that GCSE languages are.

Now that education is compulsory to 18, GCSEs are only useful for admission to further education colleges. Replace them with internally assessed certificates like they have in the USA.

Remove politics and allegations of grade inflation from A levels forever by getting rid of them and switching all state schools over to the IB.

You don't have time to relax, spend time with family/friends in the same way those who don't work can.

This is a South-East example, 50-60k goes a lot further once you leave London/Home Counties.

It's a different link, more the fool you.

&gt; Well, how lucky for you that I'm not a good royalist. Or even a royalist. That's what happens when you guess at everything instead of finding out for yourself (in this case, by just asking).

I never said you was a good royalist. I said 'good royalists would use a pound sign'.

&gt; No royal connection would mean less visitors, considering the royals are part of the attraction. 

There will always be a royal connection because of **the historic legacy**. I presume then the Egyptian pyramids and other ruins have a reduced attraction because there isn't a resident Pharaoh. Equally why on earth would I go to see a Shakespeare play without his direction? Why would people visit the Coliseum without there actually being a despot in the audience throwing Christians to the lions? Why would anyone visit Hadrian's Wall without the presence of a few sentries?

&gt; How far do you think you'd get applying this logic to the many other royal-related sites, instead of cherry-picking the ToL? The fact that you're doing this gives away more than you appear to realise (or admit).

If we got rid of the queen and opened up Buckingham palace it is safe to presume that it would generate more revenue. Edinburgh castle: I went for the castle not to shake hands with a monarch. The Royal Art galleries: I went for the art not to shake hands with royalty.  The Royal Opera house: I haven't been there but I would go for the entertainment.

&gt; ~~If we remove the royals as a needless cost, then what else gets removed? Do we need Beefeaters? Do we need the crown jewels? The ravens? And would removing any/ all of these mean anything to tourist visits either? How many other facets that only exist because of the royals would be removed as well? Now demonstrate how tourists don't come to see any of these things and therefore would make no difference either.~~

Irrelevant.

&gt; And so we're back to complaining that because the royal sites aren't the top of the charts, then they mean nothing. 

It's the best evidence there is that royal tourism is marginal. You still have failed to quantify the monarchy it terms of hard cash. 500m£? A fudged dishonest figure. Got anything else? ""BUT THE POSTCARDS!!!111."" No.

I have never said they 'mean nothing'. My position is that the argument of keeping the monarchy because it is a driver of tourism is at best weak, and at worst non-existant. It shouldn't be used to legitimise the existence of monarchy. Read that last part again, I'll quote it so you definitely don't miss it:

What I love about music is its sound, and not the scientific processes BEHIND the sound. 

What I love about art is looking at it, not the chemicals used to make the paint.

What I love about literature is the meaning behind the words, not the science behind making the paper on which it is printed.

As someone who is not a scientist, this looks like a very closed-minded way of teaching. I love the idea of doing something in contrast to religious schools (as there is no 'opposite' as such existing already).

 However, religious schools don't attempt to shove religion down its students throat in EVERY subject. I went to a Catholic school and the only subjects religion got a look in was in R.E., sex ed and school masses.

I know that if a landlord has not secured the deposit in one of the recommended schemes then he's in big trouble.  It used to be that if you brought this to the attention of the authorities as long as he DID pay it in by the day of the hearing he got off with it, but now it has to be placed in a scheme within two weeks and, if not, you may claim compensation.  

What I find somewhat flawed about this is that there are two sorts of schemes.  One in which the actual money is held for the tenant and one in which some sort of premium is paid (by the managing agency usually) without the capital being handed over, thereby earning the agents interest while they hold it in their own bank account.  From the number of agents doing this it would appear the interest is greater than the insurance premium required to safeguard the money.  So, if the letting/manging agents go tits up how will that help you get your deposit back ?  It should be that the actual deposit is held with the trustees of the scheme.  Anything else is just an attempt.

Edit :  The only reason I'm familiar with this is due to my landlord selling our property to someone else.  At this point it becomes mayhem and there are little or no guidelines in place to protect all parties concerned.

I was quite happy with VDV stating he wants to stay at WHL after the Schalke news started bubbling up as that was a situation that i actually could see tempting him and Levy.  12M for VDV is a good price and solid ROI on what we paid for him from the Spurs view.  For VDV closer to his wife's working life and the ability to play CL with one of his close friends (Huntlaar) plus a sizable raise is certainly tempting.  He could potentially still consider it, i hope he stays though.

I would agree that you need to have some older players who have been through it all to temper the youth (especially if you change coaches) but from a pure business standpoint it is possible to bring in veteran players on the cheap so if you get a solid offer for a veteran you certainly owe it to everyone to consider it.

It really isn't. 

The problem is you need to factor in the fact you are not paying housing nor commuting bills. For instance in my family unit they make up almost 50% of our outgoings. If we didn't have those to pay I could quite happily live from a minimum wage job.  

Someone who loses their 50k job and gets £65 quid/week is going to be shifting heaven and earth to find a new job. (I lost mine last year when company went bust - took me 4 weeks to find a same salary job - I never bothered going to the JobCentre as it takes 6-8 weeks for benefits to kick in).

I said this in another thread - I used to work with people on benefits/housing etc on a regular basis (constituency office for an MP). Most people we saw (edit: on the benefits issues) were serial abusers, i.e. single mums with 6 kids, families where nobody had worked for generations, people 'on the sick'. They knew how to work the system and they do. Hell I didn't even know you can be entitled to quite literally 10's of different types of benefits depending on your situation. It was refreshing to see someone who genuinely needed benefits to come to us for help. 

Most benefits are also given by local councils (i.e. housing)  - the universal benefit is a great idea if they can introduce it and should solve a lot of problems without resorting to the 'voucher system', which is degrading and still open to abuse.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I do think that workfare as an idea is a very good one.  The implementation has just been awful though.

The principle is that it works both ways: a person gets experience in a job that will be useful for them in a future job and a company can work out if a new role in an organisation is a worthwhile one without having to worry about the costs of a permanent employee, plus they can use the time with the person to work out what skill sets they need when they make the job full time.

The problem has arisen because we're letting companies who can afford to take on temp staff put people into positions which aren't new.  Tesco do not need to be part of this scheme to work out if they need a new shelf stacker.  Your local butchers who was thinking about having a fresh fruit stall should be.

But it needs up front time and effort finding these companies, working out the goals of the programme, evaluating the performance of the person afterwards, working with the job centre to see if it is a success and how to go about getting someone in there permanently.

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"The Romans had a very odd marriage set up.  Women at the time were considered property and had very little say in anything. It was a verbal agreement between the fathers or her father and the future husband, money would exchange hands and they would be legally bound together. Then they would go have a short temple sermon and that was it. Either party could end the marriage, one of them would go to the temple and say I want a divorce and that was that. The man would then have to give the dowry back or he would be put to death. This gave the woman at the time a surprising amount of power as even though they were legally owned by the husband they could threaten divorce at any time without repercussions - killing your wife because she did this was also a death sentence because it was a insult to the gods and her father as after the divorce she would go back to being his property. The Romans took this so seriously as they mainly married for political and social means, meaning her father would stand to lose a potentially powerful tool.  Incidentally men had to do what their fathers told them to as well whatever age they were, the head of the house's word was literally law, if a 80 year old man wanted to kill his 60 year old son he could do so without question or fear of arrest.

Yes I was, and for that I apologise.  I wasn't meaning to cast any aspersions on you or the police.  It's the same kind of advice I'd give anyone signing anything, especially when under stress.  Applies just as much to signing a contract.  There's legal doctrine called non est factum (it is not my deed), where you can escape your responsibilities under a contract which is fundamentally different to that which you imagined you were signing, but it's largely limited to civil contractual settings and in circumstances where it isn't simply the negligence of the signer in not reading the document before them.  Read and check every-fucking-thing before you put your name to it.

for me, the answer to all of these questions is nothing. sure, he's a good footballer but do we want to go out and sign robinho, ibrahimovic, van persie, mueller, tevez, rooney, etc. on the sole reason that they are a good footballer? nope.  

from what i've seen of Neymar, he's not a team player. he does everything himself, even when an option to a  teammate is the best move. not good for a club trying to build a team and some sort of stability and cohesion. chelsea isn't in brazil. 

the only thing Neymar could add to our club is another petulant cunt in the dressing room and on the pitch who thinks everyone is beneath him. that would certainly do wonders for our club. 

i've had more than my fair share of complaints about drogba's antics. i was ready for him to leave 2 years ago. i'm glad he stuck around to help us win the CL, but the things that drogba has done for chelsea on the pitch, in the dressing room, off the pitch, as well as all of his humanitarian aid makes him 1,000 times the person and player that neymar is.

It's not really the banks though is it?

The merchants are the guys that manage it all. Theres no real cost to the banks, the fees for making payments come from the store, to the merchant then maybe a small fee to the bank. but who pays these? Us.

Banks love new technology because it reduces risk and liability for them. Remember the old days with signed cards? Card gets stolen and authorisation is easy forged. Now with chip and pin. If an authorisation is made, its the customers fault. Same with using your credit card online, if your card is authorised with your bank login details or similar, It's your fault.

Now, I'm fine with that, but what I dont't like is that its easy for personal information like this to get fleeced out of people unknowingly. Then It's down to the individual to prove it. Thats nice when you give the bank your money every payday.

true,TheGidbinn,null,null,"So, both my parents are teachers and they probably have stronger opinions on this than I do, but from what they've told me I have a dim picture of the debate in my head.

First, bringing back Grammar Schools will not solve all the world's problems. For those who are able to pass the 11+, it's great, but it basically writes off 3/4 of the nation's youth as 'not good enough' before they've had a chance to learn and develop as human beings. The quality of primary education that children receive is largely dependent on where they live and which schools they're in the catchment areas for - If you're an unlucky kid and get sent to a poor primary school you may basically have lost before the game's even begun. It's important to give everyone a chance to find what they're good at and pursue it, regardless of what point in the education system they're in.

I'll give you an example - I did not sit the 11+. I used to get extremely stressed about exams, and would probably have failed miserably if I'd attempted it. I went to a really pretty terrible secondary school, got mediocre grades, constantly got bullied by other students and eventually ended up suicidally depressed and had to take meds for several years. They also transferred me to another school, with much smaller classes and better resources. It was only *then*, at the age of 13-14, that I started getting better grades, it was only then that I realized that I was good at, and had a passion for, the sciences and maths. Now I have a place at a top UK university. The school system almost failed me, and that same system has probably failed many more like me.

Second: Early years education is extremely important. It's like an exponential decay graph, a single year of good schooling early on is worth 5 or 10 later down the line. I'm appalled to see cuts being made by the conservatives to early years programmes, and money being spent on ridiculous things like bibles, and 'academies' that students walk out of with (on average) poorer grades than if they'd gone to a mainstream comprehensive. For fucks' sake, more focus on reception and key stage 1.

Remove the bureaucracy. For the love of god. Every minute you spend making a teacher fill out forms or assign learning plans and targets and IEPs is a minute that they could be teaching. You might not think it, but there are vast, vast mountains of paperwork associated with the job of teaching. Some of it is to try and promote a unified and methodical approach to problem-solving in schools (doesn't normally work) but most of it is just bullshit to please the government and OFSTED.

Faith schools are brianwashing.

Special schools are *extremely* important. Both for improving the quality of life for students with severe physical and mental disabilities, and also for those students with more subtle disabilities, like autism, asperger's, dyslexia and dyscalculia. It is *incredibly* difficult to get a statement of special needs even for a student who obviously does have them, because apparently people think it's a pointless label, or that it's bad for kids to have it, or because it's 'overdiagnosed' (hint: none of those things are even remotely true). Without a statement, teachers won't understand, other students won't understand, and the kid will have an absolutely fucking rotten time because they *need* to be taught\talked to\treated in a particular way. Even worse, cuts to education are affecting special schools quite badly. Special schools are not segregation or discrimination. For many disabled students they are entirely necessary, because a mainstream school simply cannot provide the facilities, the teaching and the support that a disabled student needs.

As an addendum, I would say that mental disabilities like asperger's, autism, dyslexia and etc are vastly overrepresented in the scientific and academic communities. It is worth spending more money on them. Undeniably.

Finally, I'll say a bit about the curriculum. It should be scrapped and reeled back to only the bare essentials. Kids need to be given the freedom to choose what they want learn in schools, forcing nerdy kids to do PE is pointless. Forcing kids who are clearly not mathematically talented (and who have no interest in learning maths) to do maths is pointless. Forcing anyone to do RE is pointless and as far as I can tell it has done fuck-all to promote multiculturalism, tolerance and understanding, it's just bored the shit out of a generation of young people and made them bitter and cynical about education. Also, I think the heavy emphasis on standardizaiton, exams and mark schemes is really screwing over the creatives and lateral thinkers. Teaching children specifically so that they can pass exams really only rewards one particular kind of intelligence. 'Well', you might say, 'I don't see you proposing any kind of viable alternative'. I'm not. I think the problem is that there is no objective measurement of finding out how smart someone is, or how good at something someone is, and there never will be. So I don't approve of the fact that the entire education system is based around that, because it's an impossible task.

 What about attempting to get ALL children a good level of education! No matter what class or background they are from, its a failure of the current market driven education system, which is getting more business and private influences weighed onto it. We're not teaching children to learn for them selves, but rather teach them to pass exams.

I know this from first hand experience, my exam results and benchmarking always where bad, but if you compare it to my abilities today, it's almost unimaginable that I would of been good at software engineering when I was a teenager, if grammar schools where to return, then I would of been considered nothing more then a no good dunce for the rest of my life.

End of the day, this whole subject goes down to sociological levels too and a lot of society it self is to blame for allowing education to be purely left on the shoulders of the government institutions, since when should we trust Governments on such subjects?

Started one of the earlier levels that contain, as far as I know, three parts. First you play as the Doctor.

Next, you play as River Song. On her level, it is impossible to solve the maze without the help of the bad guys chasing you. Seems odd, but now upon retrospect, it was kind of a cool gameplay mechanic. However, the task that has to be done while you are being chased is a tremendous time waster.

After that, the Doctor and River team up again. This is where things got bad. River's AI ruined the level for me. I tried to get up on a ledge by using a block that we both had to push. I got up fine, she did not. I then tried to move the block with her again, be she just kept jumping into a wall. Tried to go on without her, but I couldn't seeing as I needed her to move that block. Thinking that it would not be a big deal because there had been so many transitions in the game, I decided to restart the level.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"&gt;Surely community service (picking up rubbish, removing grafitti etc) would be better? Since it's taxpayers paying for peoples' benefits, at least the taxpayers benefit this way

I disagree with you.

Unemployment benefits are in place to ensure that people who cannot find work don't starve to death or end up on the street.  They are not there so that taxpayers benefit in some way by having rubbish picked up.  If, as a society, we decide that we have a problem with litter on the street, that is clearly a role that needs to be carried out and should, therefore, become 'a job'.  We can then pay someone a fair wage to do it.

I find this whole concept of 'earning your benefits' to be morally reprehensible.  And I speak as someone who has never been out of work and has always paid my tax.  If my tax can help someone who's fallen on hard times, then that's great.  I don't expect anything back from them other than finding a job when one is available and ploughing their own taxes back into the system to help the next disadvantaged person.",0,1339608420,null,0,false,0,c503kp7,t3_uzt04,t1_c503kp7,t1_c503d5r,null,1429134504,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

Although I agree that competing with those teams for signings is very difficult, I would like to ask the question: Out of Adebayor, Defoe, Van der Vaart, Bale, Modric, Lennon and Saha; who did Tottenham sign when in the champs league and who did they sign before?

If memory serves then Defoe, Bale, Modric and Lennon were all pre-champions league players. All very good now and certainly top-4 team players.

The point I'm making is that we can attract players with potential to be in the same position 3-4 years from now.... its just bloody difficult! That was the point in getting Comolli in the first place; because he (supposedly) got Tottenham so many players that became champions league quality at Spurs.

If Tottenham were able to attract the right players 4-5 years ago, then we can now. But if all the best sporting directors and managers in the world have so much trouble with this, what chance do the fine gents of /r/liverpoolfc have? :)

Guadiola was successful at Barca because of an overall strategy they had in place at the club to develop a cadre of players to play a certain way. It wasn't really him *per se*. Therefore if he came to Chelsea where he's meeting new players who were not brought up under that Barca regime, it means that he would probably be an abject failure.

On the other hand, even if he never invented the system, he's the one that made it actually work on the field - where it matters. Surely he would be able to take his insights to Chelsea and work some magic there too.

The point is that an assured shorthold tenancy is *assured*. As long as you're paying rent and not destroying the property, it's pretty much impossible to get you out during the term.

Contrast that with the states in the USA that have a wide range of rental terms. Some states have statutory periods that simply match the payment period. Combine that with an at will tenancy, and you can be in a situation where, if you pay weekly, your landlord can turf you out with a weeks notice!

Obviously some states are better than others, but the point I was making was; considering that the OECD has a country in it like the USA which has a wide range of statutory rental terms, some better than the UK and some worse, you can't really say that the UK has the shortest tenancy terms in the OECD.",0,1339611055,null,0,false,0,c504bd9,t3_uzhn8,t1_c504bd9,t1_c5030oy,null,1429134921,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,victoriaj,uk,London,"This comes from the Housing Act 2004. 

Unfortunately the courts somewhat undermined a pretty promising pro-tenant piece of legislation. When it first came into being some courts would give the penalty to anyone when the scheme hadn't been used initially, but other courts were dismissing cases where the landlord placed money into the scheme at the last minute before the court hearings, and a few courts would then even award costs against the tenants, When the first caselaw from higher courts came through it confirmed that penalties wouldn't be paid where the scheme had been used before the court date. 

I was pretty much an expert on the deposit scheme until about a year ago, and it's possible there have been new developments. The last I had heard though it really wasn't getting a lot of people the penalty amount. 

[This](http://www.pims.co.uk/Landlord_Deposit_Fines_Sanctions) gives some more information. Looking at that the localism bill updated it from 3 times penalty to the 1 to 3 times penalty you are talking about, and reinstated the ability to take action when the tenancy had ended. However it doesn't seem any clearer about whether the penalty will be payable where the landlord uses the scheme late, so I wouldn't bet on actually collecting. 

The other really interesting part of the legislation is that if the deposit scheme is not used the landlord cannot use the accelerated (common no fault ) eviction process. 

The real downside of the deposit scheme is that the landlord can refuse mediation through the scheme and you end up having to make a county court claim exactly as you would have done before the scheme existed.

1. the playing style, it doesn't suit the league (see Arsenal) it doesn't suit the club and it doesn't suit the players we have at the moment. I find Barcelona fairly boring to watch sometimes, it is amazing the amount of possession they have but when they come up against a team willing to stand firm they are made to look ordinary, I don't think this would work in the EPL. Could he adapt another style, I don't know...

2. Guardiolas mental strength; despite his incredible sucess he didn't stay in the job at Barca? Why? He always said he found the pressure hard to deal with, this was with a club he loved and in a city/country he grew up in, surrounded by support from players, staff, fans and the board, what happens if he starts to lose in England without all those factors?

3. His team; He had a very successful team, partly built by himself, who were bought through the academy to play in a certain way and he had Messi, he wouldn't have either of those things at Chelsea.

4. His knowledge of clubs outside of La Liga and the ECL, I'm not sure how much he would know about Stoke, esp on a wet afternoon.

And while I see your point, I wouldn't necessarily call using 'T' and 'H' instead of 'TH' as a mistake. It still reads the same regardless. I think that for 'TH', 'SH', and 'NG', you can use either the syllable or both letters. It's more of a matter of preference in my mind. You'll notice that in 'wedding' I used the 'NG'. In this case, I chose to spell it 'T He' instead of 'THe'. It's semantics. ",0,1339613336,null,0,false,0,c504y4s,t3_uyz9l,t1_c504y4s,t1_c5046jt,null,1429135225,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

A US diplomat was on a state visit to the USSR, where his hosts were giving him a whistlestop tour to display the glorious prosperity of their nation. This day's focus was on livestock and agriculture.

Soviet, holding up an apple the size of a melon: ""Here is a regular apple grown from our orchards!""  
US Diplomat: ""Very impressive!""  
Soviet, handing him a strawberry, the size of an apple: ""And here is a Soviet strawberry, sweeter than any you have tasted.""  
Again, the diplomat responds, ""Remarkable""  
The Soviet emmisary now offers a teaspoon of Honey, stating: ""And this is some honey from our beehives. We grow our bees to be 100x as big as your American bees, so they are 100x as efficient!""  
US Diplomat: ""That's incredible! And these giant bees, how large their hives must be!""  
Soviet: ""Their hives are the regular size.""  
US Diplomat: ""But how do they fit?""  
Soviet: ""They have to fit.""

Note: I find it funnny how neither Henderson nor Rodriguez made your list for Liverpool players, since you've put down fringe players like Berbatov and Chicharito for United and Lukaku for Chelsea. 

Let's talk positions first. 

**In the position of striker**, we have Carroll and Suarez. Suarez has the ability to play as an inside forward on either the right or left, so we should assume that Carroll is likely going to be first choice in this position. With only Suarez as the alternative, we should be looking at a back-up striker who can act as competition for Carroll, but not someone who is going to sulk about not being in the first team. This means that the player should be taking a big step-up in joining Liverpool. It also means we should not be paying too much for what is essentially a squad player. 

Candidates: 

**Luuk de Jong** (Twente) - 

Pros: Top scorer in Eredivisie last season. Twente is not in Champions League. 

Cons: Under a lot of media attention. Has 2 years left on contract. Likely to only leave for a big fee. Will want a first-team place.

Likelihood:Medium to Low. Transfer fee a big obstacle.




**Burak Yilmaz** (Trabzonspor) - 

Pros: Scored lots of goals in Turkish league. Has 5 million Euro release clause. 

Cons: Turkish league not as competitive as English league. 

Likelihood: Medium. Release clause makes him a low risk option. Also unlikely to ask for overly high wages as there is minimal media hype.

**Guiseppe Rossi** (Villareal) - 

Pros: Good finisher who is also creative. Villareal is relegated, which means he would be easy to acquire. 

Cons: Is injured until next February. Ridiculous to buy a player who can only the last 2 months of next season. 

Likelihood: Minimal. Long term injury makes this a non-prospect. 

**Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang** (Saint-Etienne)

Pros: 16 goals and 11 assists in Ligue 1. 4th highest scorer after Nene, Giroud and Hazard. Only 22 years old. Versatile, can play on the right. 

Cons: On a long term contract until 2016. 

Likelihood: Medium to high. He is unlikely to cost much at his age, and he might be eager to make the jump from Ligue 1. Inexperience might count against him, however.


I'll do the other positions tomorrow. Tired. Sorry.

Edit: If anyone is interested, my candidates for Right Wing are Gaston Ramirez, Susaeta, Jeremy Menez and Keisuke Honda.

There was another one, about a nuclear power plant, but I forget the details. But the basic gist of them tended to be the notion of Soviet mindset stating the way things had to be while ignoring or circumventing practical issues. If you read up on the USSR, you'll see that they had a tendency to declare that they would do something, or that henceforth things would be a certain way, and let other aspects fail so long as their proposed course of action had the appearance of success. Similar things happen under all governments, and places like North Korea are especially relevant modern examples of the extreme, but somehow the USSR in particular garnered this stereotype. The humor, such as it is, derives from the fact that, though these bees are large and productive, they're being thrust into an impractical, unsustainable situation. It would be like if a government declared that everyone would get free government cookies every night, and spent considerable time and money to do this, while ignoring the fact that its population is unable to buy bread and vegetables.",0,1339614623,null,0,false,0,c505awr,t3_uzu5q,t1_c505awr,t1_c5051n4,null,1429135397,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

If some purportedly liberal bishops are taking there stance for church unity (or power) over the morality of the issue this indicates that really they have neither. The evidently have no power as they are unable to rally the support or loyalty from the evangelical branches of the church and they have no morality as they are selling out the rights of others to maintain there organizations political influence. 
 
 
At some point liberals in the CofE will have to ask themselves how long they want to stand and support bigots who stand in the way of the social progress they them self would support. The agree for church unity card has been played many times by the more evangelical and conservative arms of the church. With them mostly getting there way or at very least securing an opt out for there churches. For example churches can opt out of having a female priest.
 
This preisdent makes the CofE a negative orgonisation regarding the rights of others who are disliked by evangelicals.

Funnily enough it's usually the same people that are the first to shout about how we need a stimulus to help with growth, well the Olympics is a very effective and academically proven stimulus and we should welcome it. 

I recently studied the subject for an international tourism management module and discovered that previous games have recouped 75% of the costs through Tourism alone. I expect we will exceed this for numerous reasons. 
 
During the actual games, although total tourism numbers generally dip slightly, the average spend per head goes berserk in comparison to normal. This is still fairly minimal in the scheme of things, the real money comes in the years following the Games. London is a fantastic city and the Olympics acts as a massive ongoing global advert unlike anything else. It's practically the holy grail of tourism advertising with over a billion viewers and I fully expect us to capitalise on the opportunity to showcase our country.      

The conferences arranged to coincide with the games, are expected to bring in over £1b of new business to the country and finally the money spent itself is not just thrown away, it goes towards wages which are often spent in the local economy, infrastructure that improves the economy and business's which provide jobs. 

I'm sick of people trying to argue on one hand that we don't have growth or jobs and on the other hand business is evil and doing things that are pro business is inherently bad. It's as annoying as watching the Republicans praying for a weak economy so they can say I told you so for political advantage.

Make an easy to use on-line platform that any potential employer that is interested can sign up to and use to take on people and any employee can access their regional opportunities through. 

Make it illegal for any business to offer any non paid internship or work experience without being registered and transparent through this platform so that half decent jobs are also put through it and everyone who wants to take a free position can and will receive benefits throughout.

Have the platform show reviews from previous participants, statistics for resulting employment after completion and a clear description of what is required and offered. This will quickly show those who are abusing it and offer enough competition to create some standards. 

Make it completely voluntary and stop paying third parties to push people into it but offer a bonus for employers that reach 2 years of paid employment as a result of the scheme, the only other help third parties should offer is general interview, c.v and help service which is general and not rewarded by placement success, but user satisfaction levels.

Even if he has memories from before he was erased, he wouldn't be older than the doctor, because there would be no reason for him to have memories from the experiences of the consciousness present within the plastic.

1) Mikel. Came on strong end of last season, inconsistent, but still a worthwhile player. Keep him.

2) Meireles. Too inconsistent, a bit on the slow side, and gives away the foul and ball too often imo. Still has 3 years on contract, keep him for 1 more, if he doesn't improve he'll have to be sold.

3) Ramires. Hard worker and tireless runner. Unable to carve open defenses with through balls like Lamps, but he'll run like there's no tomorrow. Also he has vastly improved in his last season. Easy decision to keep.

4) Romeu. Still too young and wet behind the ears, a season long loan should be perfect for him.

5) Lampard. A true blue, deserves to retire at Chelsea, however we all have to admit he's getting old. Next week he'll be 34 years old. I say we keep him on 1 year contract extensions until he decides to retire.

6) Essien. This one pains me to say, but he's a shadow of his former self. He never fully came back from his knee injury(ies) and he spends way too much time on the sidelines because of it. He should be sold to someone like Milan, but for some reason Chelsea is looking to extend his contract.

So while it looks like we have 6 players for our midfield, we're not as deep a squad as we think we are. The end of the season we played our bench + those banned from the CL finals against Newcastle/Liverpool and were dominated.

I could see Fellaini wearing Chelsea blue since he has what it needs to conduct a midfield. Maybe Romeu loan + cash could be a beneficial agreement for all parties involved..",0,1339623891,null,0,false,0,c507wcz,t3_uytw5,t1_c507wcz,t1_c4zsa1e,null,1429136609,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

I haven't seen him at Sunderland though.

He is very static though, and don't know how well he would fit into a possession based game. 

He is not the ideal signing, but I don't think he would be a total disaster if we just play to his strengths. He has a international record that can match many of the big names.

The more I look into it, though, the more I'm inclined to agree that the limit wasn't just something legally imposed by the Time Lords; however, since the most detailed explanation (given in Zagreus) regarding the ability to regenerate involves biogenic molecules introduced into Time Lord bodies by Rassilon (with a limit programmed into them), it may just be a question of finding more of these molecules or overriding their limits rather than going through the elaborate process of altering DNA that a biological limit would probably require.  Zagreus also explains that the limit was created because the *biogenic molecules* started to decay, not because Time Lord bodies were incapable of handling further regenerations.

By their second appearance in ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" the Daleks added a set of vertical rectangular slats around their casing which received power transmitted from their ship.  For the rest of the classic series, they had these receivers.

The Daleks were already using time travel technology as of their third appearance in ""The Chase,"" but in the new series they had developed it to the point where they were apparently using some kind of time-travel related energy as a power source, hence being able to collect residual time energy from Rose.

1. Stop lumping all the students together by age. They need to be grouped by their academic ability so that we can stop having the academically successful kids waste years repeating lessons they already know. I could have been in college by 14, because the last two years in highschool were a complete waste for me - we were just going over the same old things again and again.

2. Bring back trade schools and apprenticeships. Just because a kid fails at being book-smart, it doesn't mean he can't be a skilled professional. We still need plumbers, builders, car mechanics and metal-workers, and kids shouldn't have to wait until they're 16 to start learning skills that are absolutely key to industry. Contrary to what the government seems to believe, there are jobs outside of the financial sector.

3. Boot out the political-social crap. The kids don't pay the slightest bit of attention to it because they know exactly what it is. The ones that care about it don't need to be taught it, and the ones that don't will refuse to take heed of any of it anyway.

4. Teach kids about things they ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW in life. How loans and credit cards work. How taxes work. How car insurance works.
It is a joke that teaching this is left to parents (many of whom have little clue themselves), or alternatively, for 16 year olds to try and figure out themselves.

5. Stop teaching Shakespeare. No, really. Just stop. If kids want to learn about the English language that much, then let them do it in college and university. We don't need 11-16 year olds wasting three hours a week for five years dissecting Macbeth for no fucking reason whatsoever. 

6. Either start teaching foreign languages to primary school children with a goal of attaining fluent speech, or drop them from the curriculum altogether. GCSE languages are an absolute joke and the most any student will learn from them is how to make a fool out of themselves abroad.

7. Stop ditching testing in favour of coursework. It penalizes every kid who sucks at communicating their thoughts - you know, as geniuses so often tend to do.

&gt; As a motivator Harry employed a pretty simple technique. Build a large squad before dividing it into pariahs and teacher’s pets. Given his force of personality nobody would want to be on the wrong end of a Redknapp tongue-lashing. For the huge majority of players there’s nothing worse than being dropped and I’ve heard several top flight managers observe the only way to motivate them is with the threat of not playing. Multiply that by the knowledge falling out with your boss would ensure you’d never be picked and it’s a pretty useful if ruthless model.

1) I wasn't comparing it to the act of rape, I was comparing it to act of labelling someone something once they've done something. You could cite a hundred frontpage articles, the fact that the stupid bullshit ones regularly get to the front page proves my point.

2) 
&gt;So many crass and infantile insults.

And then you do:

&gt;pretending at poetry

&gt;You make 12 year old xbox trolls sound reasonable

3) Clearly you're incapable of understanding humour. I lace my arguments with it because I have the ability to compartmentalise. Re-read your post; you don't see the irony?

4) The phrase ""you make xbox trolls sound reasonable"" doesn't even make sense, actually sit down and think about it.

5) 

&gt;You never find stupid memes and facebook screenshots on /r/pics 

Sometimes you do, yeah, but I accept that for a few reasons. I've unsubbed from the main subreddits, but I felt pretentious unsubbing from /r/pics and /r/videos because... well, they're just pictures and videos. I mean, seriously, it's just pics and vids. They're not all great, but you can't diminish an entire subreddit based on those criteria. Also, I don't proudly call myself a member of those subreddits; I don't have to defend them. I watch Channel 4 too; that doesn't mean I have to defend every program they've ever made.

6) ""the main criticism of /r/athiesm  is the disrespect they show religion""

That's not even close to being my point, you clearly don't understand it.

7) The phrase ""someone pretending at poetry could do better"" doesn't make any sense, once again: sit down and think about it. If I was pretending at poetry, why could I do better? I'm pretending at poetry, so I'm not good with words or poetry, so I wouldn't be able to do better. Also, what does poetry have to do with arguing, or being right in this particular instance, which I definitely am?

8) Congratulations, you exhibited the amazing ability of clicking my reddit name and looking through my submission history.

In the latter half of 2010-2011 season, we were playing with two DM, which tactics was often used by Rafa before that (the 2 in 4-2-3-1). In this formation, both DM are responsible to cover space behind advancing fullbacks when attacking, and also to shut down any passing outlet from opponent wingers when defending.

Last season however, we were relying on only one DM, whether it's only Lucas or only Spearing. Lucas, a great player that he is, was able to cope with the bigger responsibilities - covering both flanks and the space in front of the center-backs. And Spearing was initially okay with the tactics, putting great performances against top teams, but soon afterwards the weak spots in our formation were found out. One good example is Man Utd away last season when he was outplayed by their forward three - Rooney, Welbeck and Valencia. They were playing triangles around him. It was no wonder Scholes had more freedom than ever in the center midfield.  

To judge Spearing as not good enough based on the latter half of last season only is unfair to him.

In October 2008, following the sacking of Juande Ramos by Tottenham Hotspur, the club announced that Redknapp had agreed to take over as the new manager at Spurs.[42] Tottenham paid £5 million in compensation to Portsmouth for letting Redknapp go.[43] Spurs had secured only two points from the first eight games of the season prior to Redknapp's arrival and lay bottom of the league, but in his first two weeks in charge he took the club out of the relegation zone, winning ten out of the twelve points available with wins against Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool and Manchester City and a remarkable 4–4 draw against North London rivals Arsenal. In January 2009, Redknapp signed five new players in order to add quality and much-needed depth to his squad.

I would argue that he has proven himself to be one of the most consistently composed players in Germany, if not the world, over the last few years.

Furthermore, their own statistics would seem to back my claim up. They list him as being significantly very strong in passing, key passes, and through balls.

What statistics are they basing concentration levels on if not a demonstrated numerical proficiency in: passing, key passes, through balls, blocking the ball, and tackling (*all categories that B.Schweinsteiger is listed as being statistically either significantly very strong, or significantly strong in.*)

Kranjcar hasn't been used much since Gareth Bale's vast improvements. Gio is a strange case. Harry clearly avoids playing him. When Lennon was injured Harry switched to 3 central midfielders.

&gt;While Bosingwa may play poorly, he may not be doing anything that would statistically lead one to conclude he's a poor player. 

This is basically my original point. While *statistically* perhaps Bosingwa isn't a poor player, you and I can still agree that he often plays poorly. This disjunction is due to statistical data's inability to account for the myriad of contingent factors which contribute to a single player's performance within the team. 

For instance, if Spurs played a system in which Modric's primary role was to break up opposition play his number of attempted tackles per game would likely increase, and thus the opportunity for him to rack up a higher number of successful tackles per game would also increase. This could end up rendering him a *statistically* stronger tackling player. 

But the fact that he doesn't currently execute a high number of successful tackles per game, given the position he plays within his team, shouldn't lead us to believe imo that he is a ""weak tackling"" player. 

I think your previous comparison to Lampard here is perfect: whilst he had an average of 1.4 successful tackles per game last season(41 tackles over 30 appearance), the ""low-ness"" of 1.4 as a number doesn't necessarily equate to ""weakness"" in tackling ability, just a certain frequency of occurrence.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I was talking with a friend of mine (a Chelsea fan) tonight about this...and he broke down our choices as such.....

Think about being a 20 year old going into a bar on a friday, all you want to do is drink and find a girl to bring home. As the night goes on you see 4 girls...

Mary - Ah Mary, you know her she was the girl from down the street. You grew up with her. Nice girl, pretty, smart, loyal, your family knows her, she is familiar and safe. Not exciting, but steady.  -  This is Moyes, you know what you will get, odds are he will maintain the team at around the same level, he won't excite you but he probably won't disappoint you.

Martina - She's young and attractive, she seems smart, shes pretty but a little all over the place. You can't get a great read on her or what will happen.   - This is Martinez, lots of potential but he is the same coach that managed to have Wigan in the Relegation battle for 3 seasons. Maybe it was the lack of funds or the lack of talent or lack of coaching insight. He could be VERY good or VERY bad. A bit of a Gamble.

Carolina - She is sexy an exotic. She has traveled. She is well read. She has seen and done things. She is exciting.  But you can't get a clear read on her, you have no idea if she is into you or not. At times she seems focused and other times she seems to be daydreaming.  - This is AVB, he has the credentials and the attitude of success on the continent. Everything about him seems to be tailor made to be a great choice. but at times he does things that seem completely out of line with what anyone else would do, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Could be a great fit for Spurs, an elite coach who could be with them for years....or the Chelsea experience could be what you get with him and he may not be able to handle the egos in the English game.

Finally there is Maria - She is a little older, she doesn't speak great English. She is still attractive. she seems a little arrogant, she talks down to you but at the same time she makes you feel safe.  she could be mapping out your life together or plotting your murder and telling you all of it in broken English and you aren't sure what may happen - This is Capello, has the resume, despite the issues he had with England he still managed to win at a higher % than his predecessors. He played dull football, but it worked.  He would maintain the team where it is and maybe move it up but he would drive everyone completely up the wall while doing it.

For me....personally I choose AVB with Moyes as the #2, AVB is a risk but he plays the type of football that would fit Spurs, if everything clicked it may be easy for our team to improve.  If things didn't click, in March we could be looking at a new coach.

Martinez on the other hand attacks boldly even against good teams and in such a way that he gets results-- see the Man U game.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"I'll give you a completely made-up example of how your proposal could work, simply because I'm trying to show another side of it.  We'll invent a guy called Fred.

Fred has worked for 25 years at the same company. He has been a good employee, taking only a handful of sick days in that entire time, always paying his taxes and NI, and generally ""doing the right thing"".

Fred's boss decides that his company isn't making enough money, so sets about sacking some people, Fred included, to reduce operating costs.

Suddenly, for the first time in his life, Fred is unemployed.

He goes to the Job Centre but, unfortunately, in his part of the country there are 20 job-seekers for each vacancy and he is unable to get a job.  Regardless, Fred keeps on applying each and every day for a variety of different roles.

6 months go by during which Fred reads constantly in the newspaper about 'the benefits culture' and sees himself demonised as some sort of freeloader.  At one point, someone in the street tells Fred to ""get a job, you sponging bastard.  Why should I pay for you to laze around?"".

""Ah well,"" says Fred, ""at least after 25 years of paying my tax, the safety blanket of my benefits is there and I'm not going to lose my home and family.""  Society, however, does not see it this way.  Society does not remember how much Fred has paid in to the system, only that he is now a 'drain on resources'.  And it must be true, because the newspapers say so and even the Government says so.

Fred has, after many years of hard work, been turned into an enemy of society.

And so, the next time that Fred goes  into the Job Centre to try and find work, he is told that he must perform 20-30 hours of community service to continue receiving his benefits.

""And, in any case, if there's actual work that needs to be done like cleaning up local green spaces or removing graffiti from tower-blocks, surely that represents a real job; one that should pay a decent living wage?

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Firstly, about the immigrant thing, you probably will be judged differently, but it goes both ways. If you are unsuccessful, people will perhaps have less patience with you, but you will also be greatly respected if you manage to triumph, and become prosperous, and comfortable with British culture. On the issue of 'taking our jobs', my attitude is that people who are intelligent and forward moving, and generally good at their jobs, create employment around them, through their contribution to the economy.

I'll try to give the best advice I can, but it's going to be a bit scattergun and rambling.

Firstly, I think you'll struggle with office jobs, because there are lots of administrators being made redundant from the public sector right now, with qualifications and experience coming out of their ears. There will be a surplus of these people for many years to come. I wouldn't waste your time trying to get into it.

Secondly, there's quite a lot of information available on the internet about careers and university, and I'd advise you to simply do your research well and carefully before deciding which direction to take. No matter how talented you are, it's always going to be easier to get a decent job where there is demand for your services. So, for instance, [this data](http://m.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jul/15/employment-statistics-university-graduates?cat=news&amp;type=article) about employment by university and course. Ideally, I suppose you want it to meet two basic criteria: something which you enjoy, and which is in demand. Another thing to look out for is a vocational structure to the course- some courses have sandwich years which will allow you to get your foot into the door of a particular company, and if you do well people are often employed in the same company after graduating. 

I should say, all this is dependent on your immigration status allowing you to get funding, which I don't know anything about, and which you'll have to check out online.

Another organization which may be of help (although I stress 'may') is Connexions, who are a government funded careers service for young people. There does seem to be [one in Birmingham](www.connexions-bs.co.uk/), although they seem to have changed to limit their help to people who are unemployed. In any case, it's worth a look. They've got a lot of material there about careers (all sorts of stuff, from books listing typical careers, average wages, routes into employment, etc, to uni prospectuses, to CV writing guides, and so on). Even if you can't see an advisor, I'd be surprised if they wouldn't let you go in and read what they have.

As other people have said, your languages are likely to be your major asset at the moment, especially if they're something relevant (particularly for import/export links) and/or prized (for instance, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, etc), and especially if you have the expertise and skill to translate both formally and informally, and in writing and speech. I really have no idea how to get into that, but try Googling translation services, and sending out emails, even if they're just to enquire which route you need to take. You might also try volunteering (there may be organizations that help immigrants in your area, who need help, and who would be able to give you references and/or attest to your translation skill). That might also be something to look at for university, although it may be difficult to find something that matches your current ability. Again, you could try emailing academic staff, and asking them what route to take.
 
Also, if you do end up going to university, try and make as much of it as you can. Try and get internships over the Summer (which you'll have to organize more than six months in advance, and which will again give you a foot in the door), and join clubs, get on their executives etc. Again, someone who comes from abroad, who can adapt and outcompete British people on their own ground, and become a part of the community, will be prized (especially if they do so in a way that can be written on a CV!). If you do all that, and get a first on a course which is in demand, your life will be there on a platter.

But again, I'm really not sure about university funding. You may well have to be a citizen to get funding, either of Britain or the EU, or have years of residency. You need to look into that first.",0,1339650524,null,0,1339653034,0,c50dxv2,t3_uv5to,t1_c50dxv2,t3_uv5to,null,1429139535,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So's you know, I'm drawing from having seen Series 1-6, specials and extras inclusive, as well as Seasons 1, 2, and half of 3 of Classic, plus the movie and first three audio dramas with the Eighth Doctor. I am working through Classic and Eight's audio stories right now, and have limited knowledge of them, as a result.

**Favorites**

Doctor - Quite honestly, all of them. If I had to pick one to run away with, though, it would be Eleven.

Companion - Vicki. I like Vicki a lot. I also have an almost irrational love for Wilf and Donna.

Episode - I think ""A Christmas Carol"" encapsulates most everything I love best about Doctor Who. I can always 
rewatch this one.

Season - I still maintain that I like the arc of Series 1 the best. However, I think Series 5 and 6 contain the most number of my favorite individual stories.

Writer - I have thoroughly enjoyed every Dennis Spooner classic story that I've seen so far.

Villain - I like the potential of the Silents/ce a lot, but have yet to have that justified. Daleks for Classic Who, by far.

Guest Companion - Timothy Latimer, from Human Nature/The Family of Blood


**Less than Favorite**

Doctor - None of them

Companion - Rose

Episode - ""Fear Her"" has very little repeat value for me. ""The Web Planet"" was torturous to get through.

Season - Series 2

Writer - As much as we owe to him, Terry Nation leaves a lot to be desired.

Villain - Hybrid Human-Dalek Sec, if we're going solely on appearance. Every single person in Midnight, if we're going by personality.

I've tried to answer ""why"" when and where possible, but I'm sure not all of my answers will be completely satisfactory to everyone. If you've got any questions or want me to expand on anything, let me know and I'd be happy to talk a lot more about my favorite show.

That episode falls right after School Reunion - where the Doctor basically tells her why they really can't be a 'thing' (and narrowly avoids telling her how he feels) and is their first adventure taking Mickey along in the Tardis. It wouldn't be entirely out of character for him to try and put a little distance between himself and Rose at that point, but it doesn't seem like he deliberately falls for Reinette. When he goes through the mirror to save her, it's pretty typical Doctor - self sacrificing to save the day. I doubt he really thinks through the implications of his offer to take Reinette in the Tardis. I do think there has to have been a conversation off screen between him and Rose after the end of that episode because the next time we see them, they're back to flirting / ignoring Mickey.

Best doctor: 10, followed closely by  4

Best companion:  Sarah Jane Smith, hands down

Best Episode: Ugh, this is where it gets tough. I just finished The Five Doctors and it was pretty fantastic, even if it is a giant fanwank. I like 42 best out of the new series, but School Reunion, Vincent and the Doctor, The Doctor's Wife, and a whole slew of others come very, very close. I adore Time Crash

Best season: Again, hard. New series, probably 6. 4 was retty good too. Old series, Trial of a Time Lord was very good - that's the only entire season  I have watch of the classics.  

Best writer: I really don't pay much attention to writers, not enough to have a favorite anyway.

Best villain: The Master, followed closely by the Vashta Nerada because they scare the crap out of me.

Best guest companion: DoesSarah Jane count? ;) I liked Vincent quite a lot, along with Lady Christina

Least favorite doctor: Out of what I have seen so far, #1. Two weeks ago I would have said#6, but I'm actually quite enjoying him now. 

Least favorite companion: Mel. For the love of all that is good, no more Mel.

Least favorite episode: The only episode from the new series I have not rewatched is Love and  Monsters. I can't bring myself to do it. Old series, I really couldn't say yet.

Least favorite season: New series, probably 2 or 3. It had it good bits, a lot of good bits, but choosing the worst out of a bunch of good things is very hard. Old series, again, I can't say  yet.

Least favorite writer: Again, I don't pay enough attention to writers to have a least favorite.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"Thanks for the tip. :)

I dislike Rose because I think her personality is often grating. She is too reliant on the Doctor to save her in some cases, and she gets things completely wrong when she tries to go off on her own in other cases. Perhaps the biggest example of the former is in ""Empty Child/Doctor Dances"" - she brought the Doctor and Captain Jack together, but otherwise had very little agency in that story. An example of the latter would be ""The Parting of the Ways""; she's been separated from the Doctor, and she tries to go back and help him (which is admirable), but she throws a fit and risks alienating the people who are trying to love, support, and help her most. And when she did get back, she did exactly what the Doctor was *not* going to do - kill. Keep in mind that Rose with the Ninth Doctor is actually my *preferred* season with her in it, too.

""The Christmas Invasion"" is another example of Rose's failed attempts at agency and was the tipping-off point that I wasn't going to enjoy a second season of her. She can't do anything but talk about the Doctor and her travels, she shows little to no interest in what Mickey's been doing, and when trouble comes, she hides and sulks because ""her"" Doctor isn't there. Contrast this with River Song in ""Silence in the Library"" who is a much stronger character *because* ""her"" Doctor isn't there to help. And when Rose does try to talk with the Sycorax, she is embarrassingly bad at ""being the Doctor.""

I mentioned earlier that she lashes out at Mickey and Jackie for trying to help in the Series 1 finale, and she does so again in ""The Christmas Invasion,"" and several other times. We have very little sense of her personal life before she went travelling with the Doctor, but it seems as though her travels haven't actually taught her what is perhaps the Doctor's most important lesson: ""I've never met anyone who wasn't important."" The attitude and outlook of the Ninth versus the Eleventh are markedly different, admittedly, but I can't get over the fact that Rose constantly disregards Mickey and leaves him to dangle each time she comes back to Earth and then zooms off again. As far as I can tell, they never officially break up, they just fall apart. When Sarah Jane suggests that Mickey join the TARDIS Team, Rose is downright passive-aggressive about the whole thing, and her general jealousy is another unattractive trait about her. Again for contrast's sake, compare with the Ponds - I know a lot of people criticize Amy for precisely the same disregard of Rory, but I think that the redeeming quality for them is that they really do love each other, and their absence from each other's lives (whether this be while Amy is travelling with the Doctor alone, when Rory was erased, or the times that both of them waited for the other) served to strengthen their relationship, in the end. Mickey had to man up and get over Rose himself because she wasn't giving him closure. He is an admirable character, the Ponds are an admirable couple and companions, but Rose is just so petty and mean, in my view.

I disliked that Rose's ""farewell"" at the end of Series 2 was dramatized so much; it's certainly in the tradition of Doctor Who to exaggerate the the crisis-level of a plot point, but it frustrated me to no end that Rose was so unable to move on with her life. She left as a character I disliked rather than pitied, and her return in Series 4 only made me groan. It was nice to bring her back for completion's sake for the Series 4 finale, but I hated that her story arc ultimately seemed to overshadow Donna's.

Rose changed from the Doctor's influence, but not necessarily for the better, and ended up with her own human Doctor in an alternate reality. Donna became so much a better person thanks to the Doctor, yet lost everything. If there's any example in the Whoniverse about how life isn't fair, it's the respective fates of Rose and Donna.

The best thing I can say about Rose is that she is really and truly human, through and through. She is perfectly ordinary and then some, coming from a working class background and speaking with a cockney-ish accent. Please don't think I'm being elitist by saying this, merely pointing out that she really does represent a very common and often-overlooked demographic for main characters to come from. Again to contrast with Donna, who continually insists that she's nothing special - Donna found what was special about her thanks to the Doctor, but I don't feel that Rose ever had that same self-actualizing revelation. She needed the Doctor to continue to justify her special-ness. If the Doctor is the ""man who makes people better,"" how did he help Rose become better? I'll answer this later, but suffice to say that she is a far from perfect character, and the biggest thing that makes her special isn't any intrinsic quality other than that the Doctor chose her.

And that's why the Doctor loved her, or so I suspect. She reminded him of everything that is beautiful and frustrating about humanity, and she brought him back from a dark place following the Time War. To go from ""stupid apes"" to ""You were fantastic"" is quite the leap for the Ninth Doctor, and even farther for ""willing to die for a single old man"" in the case of the Tenth. I asked earlier how the Doctor made Rose better, and the answer as far as I can tell is that he didn't particularly, she made him better. But having done so, he ended up outgrowing her, in my opinion. I love the Eleventh Doctor and I truly believe him when he says that everyone is important, but I think he would ultimately have little patience for Rose, if he'd met her as he is now (Two asides: First, that this might even be *why* the Eleventh goes up even further in my estimation, and Second, that yes, this causes a bit of a paradox, because how could he be the Eleventh we know if he hadn't met Rose earlier, etc. You know what I mean.). But the Ninth by accepting Rose and the Tenth by loving Rose truly *lived* what it means to believe that everybody is special.

That's a lot more than I meant to write, but it's also the most comprehensive I've ever been about my opinions on Rose. Hope that gives you some idea on my perspective, and again, feel free to dialogue with me further! I'm sure I'll find plenty more to say. ;)

My GF joined a HMO (posh name for rent share), unfortunately it turned out the Landlord was creepy and pestered them all the time. Any excuse he could think of to come in and watch them / argue with them he would use. Usually it revolved around lamps being left on (say if you were one side of the living area and lamps needed to be switched off on the other side, god forbid if you wanted to have side lamp left on in your room too!) He would shout at them, one occasion he swore at them. He even admitted to waiting in the toilet where he could spy on bedroom windows, he said this was to check for improper lights useage. 

My girlfriend, was in bits over this and would shake at the thought of staying there. They 'housemates' wrote formal letters and had meetings, even where they offered extra money so he didn't care about bills but he wouldn't stop. So despite being only 6 months into a 12 month contract she gave 30 days notice and left. 

He refused to give her the deposit back (£1000) saying she owed him 6months rent and she had failed to dry clean the curtains (wtf?). 
Here's the killer, she tried to go through the deposit protection sceme and he had bundled three housemates deposits together so they refused to help her unless all three had requested it!

So now we're going down the route of small claims to get this deposit back but it's very stressful for her, shes a special needs teacher that's very drained in the evenings.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"**PART TWO**

The biggest hole in the Liverpool offensive line-up is on the right. This is a position that has honestly plagued us for years. For a while, Gerrard was played on the right under Rafa. Then Kuyt. Last season, Henderson saw plenty of play down the right. Now, Kuyt has left us. Gerrard is no longer of the age where he can make rampaging runs down the right. Henderson has proven last season that his potential does not extend itself to that position. While Suarez can and does play as an inside forward on the right, he is also needed in the centre sometimes, and on the left sometimes. Comparing this with the left, which miraculously we have Downing, Bellamy and Rodriguez, we now have nobody on the right. Plainly said, **we NEED a right midfielder**. 

If we consider how Rodgers is likely to play, it means that our options for a right midfielder should not only be a traditional winger, but also have the ability to play as an inside forward. While some prefer left-legged players to play on the right as inside forwards, allowing them to cut in and shoot, right-legged players have the additional option of going down the line and crossing. Both cases are valid, in any case. 

Candidates:

**Gaston Ramirez** (Bologna) - 

Pros: Creative player who can play both on the right as an inside forward, on the left as a winger and in the centre as an attacking player. Familiar with Suarez as both are on the Uruguayan national team. 

Cons: Bologna wants to slap a 20 million Euro price tag on him. Also, City are rumoured to be interested. With 4 more years on his contract, the player needs to have a desire to move in order for there to be any leverage. 

Likelihood: Medium. While the Uruguayan connection is great, the price and possible competition from City is a little scary. 

**Markel Susaeta** (Atletic Club de Bilbao) - 

Pros: On the final year of his contract, Susaeta is not expected to be expensive. A very consistent performer for Bilbao, with a good number of goals and assists. Will fit in well with the Spanish speakers at Liverpool. 

Cons: A youth product of Bilbao, the player might be emotionally attached to the club and not want to leave. However, if he does move, he is unlikely to stay in Spain and compete against his hometown club.

Likelihood: Medium to high. Affordable, consistent, a move away from Bilbao might be what he needs to propel himself into the next level. 

**Jeremy Menez** (Paris Saint-Germain) - 

Pros: A good right-footed winger who can effectively play across the whole frontline, he is a very versatile and effective forward. 

Cons: While PSG might be persuaded to sell with the FFP rulings, a player with 2 years left on his contract will not come cheap, especially from a cash-rich club like PSG. 

Likelihood: Low. PSG's willingness to sell is a major factor in this. 

**Keisuka Honda** (CSKA Moscow) - 

Pros: One of the 2 gems of Japan, Honda is a left-footed player who plays well as an inside forward on the right, or in the centre. He only has slightly more than a year left on his contract, and has stated firmly his desire to play in more glamourous parts of Europe. 

Cons: At 26, his experience in Europe is limited to playing in Russia. There are no guarantees that he can adapt to the Premier League. 

Likelihood: Medium. Signing Honda on the back of United signing Kagawa is a great way to reignite the old rivalry between the clubs. 

**Milos Krasic** (Juventus) - 

Pros: A highly rated right winger who played very well in his debut season for Juventus but has been frozen out of the team due to a change in playing style, Krasic has a knack of scoring some vital goals in clutch situation, and is known for his cannon of a right foot. Juventus is reportedly ready to sell him for as little as 6 million Euros. 

Cons: It is unknown if he can regain his confidence after what happened at Juventus. At 27, it will be unrealistic to expect him to adapt to a different style of football. Rodgers has to make sure that our playing style is suitable for Krasic if we do get him. 

Likelihood: High. A highly rated international who is going for cheap after a poor spell in Italy, it could end up being the same story as the one for Bergkamp or Henry. 

**Luciano Narsingh** (Heerenveen) - 

Pros: A 21 year old who has been racking up assists in the Eredivisie, his exciting wingplay has earned him a call-up to the Dutch national team for EURO 2012. With a contract that ends in 2013, he could be itching to ply his trade in England. Loads of potential, very promising. 

Cons: Babel had loads of potential too. Can someone check if Narsingh is addicted to Twitter? 

Likelihood: Medium to High. His age and price are good pluses, but there have been too many cases of players not fulfilling their potential for this transfer to be a bit of a gamble.

The post for Attacking Midfielder will come later. The revised list of candidates is: Gylfi Sigurdsson, Gaston Ramirez, Keisuke Honda, Stevan Jovetic and Alan Dzagoev.

Doctor: Well they say your first Doctor is your favorite and I would have to agree. The 9th, he died for the women he loved
Companion: Martha, attractive, intelligent, came through in a pinch, and managed to have happy life hunting evil aliens along side her tough-guy husband.
Best Episode: ugh, I'm stuck on the Season finale of 1 and the Shakespeare episode with Tenant &amp; Martha. Oooo then there's that scary episode when they go after the silence. 
Best Season: Season 3
Best writer: no opinion.
Best Villain: I like the conflicted Master at The End of Time finale.
Best Guest Companion: Astrid, she's gorgeous and has such a wonderful/saddening story tale. I really would've liked to see her take off into the Stars with Tenant.

LEAST favorite
Doctor: I don't have one. 9th died for the woman he loved, 10th is the Bad Ass, and 11th is just too quirky not to like.
Companion: Rose after she enters the alternate universe, what is with her accent/lisp and whiny attitude? Or Donna Nobel, such an antagonizing personality.
Season: 4
Writer: none
Villain: The aliens from family of blood (weaklings with the only thing given to them is an amazing imprisonment). Or the daleks (from Season 1, 4 &amp; 5)

true,gray-pilgrim,null,null,"To be honest i never really intended to advocate the breakdown of subject boundaries, just ended up at the logical conclusion to the argument, even i think that is extreme, but worth looking at.

What i was trying to advocate was that if there are many areas of the curriculum where subjects merge.  With proper coordination we could show some subjects as far more multi faceted than we do.

If music is covering Jazz or Blues, why cant history cover slavery and emancipation at the same time, English use lyrics to discuss metaphor and simile.  What Food tech is going to do i have no idea, like you said it wont work for everything.

Why not have entire term long themes?  Love, relationships + sex, or money, or drugs. Those things the government keeps telling teachers they have to address.  I think its a powerful idea.

The scientific method is not really just about science.  Its a process of thinking that is used in loads of subjects but is directly opposed to the faith based thinking of religion.  With the scientific method every idea you hold is a theory in need of testing, every piece of evidence you have to back up that theory makes the theory stronger but it always stays a theory.  If evidence to the contrary shows up, you must change or adapt the theory.

Eg - if a fossil was found tomorrow showing a Jurassic fossil in the precambian rock layer, science would have to reassess the theory of evolution (but that doesnt stop us digging).  

But if evidence against the existence of god showed up, faith would ignore it.  I personally think producing young adults with an open and questioning mind is better than the faith alternative.

true,sipos0,uk,London,"There is obviously a lot of anti-americanism around so you can understand them getting defensive about it but, saying 'they are just jealous' is just a way to make themselves feel better. It sounds, and is, just like a parent comforting a child being bullied. Obviously if we really felt that way, we'd move there (as some people do). 

I think it is natural that they see comments from British or other European redditors as criticism. Most news is about problems ('Everything is OK' is hardly an exciting headline) so, naturally, reaction to it can often sound like criticism, especially if it is from foreigners. 

I think the reasons that so much anti-americanism exists and, the reason why they see negative comments about their country (/positive ones about others) more, are the same: their culture is very permeating due to the large amount of exported films and TV etc (due to being the largest English speaking economy in the world right now). This understandably grates on people from other countries after a while - hence the anti-americanism. It is also why they get so much reaction to their news from abroad (which they interpret negatively): we hear about their news but, they don't hear ours. If r/news was British news then I expect we'd feel the same way. 

On the one hand, I feel sorry for them experiencing this all the time, on the other hand, I don't because they could certainly be a bit more sensitive to the existence of the rest of the world.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;It's a different link, more the fool you.

From the same website. But carry on dancing.

&gt;I never said you was a good royalist. I said 'good royalists would use a pound sign'.

Sure, the inferrence was completely unobvious. Dance some more.

&gt;I presume then the Egyptian pyramids and other ruins have a reduced attraction because there isn't a resident Pharaoh. Equally why on earth would I go to see a Shakespeare play without his direction? Why would people visit the Coliseum without there actually being a despot in the audience throwing Christians to the lions? Why would anyone visit Hadrian's Wall without the presence of a few sentries?

I thought we'd dealt with exaggerations and extremes that hold no real value - but righto, leopold's palace in Brussels does a roaring trade. According to your logic, anyway.

&gt;If we got rid of the queen and opened up Buckingham palace it is safe to presume that it would generate more revenue. 

It's not 'safe' to assume anything without data to back it up. That's why 'assume' comes from the word 'assumption'.

&gt;Edinburgh castle: I went for the castle not to shake hands with a monarch. The Royal Art galleries: I went for the art not to shake hands with royalty. The Royal Opera house: I haven't been there but I would go for the entertainment.

I-I-I - and of course, tourists would think in exactly the same way you do, right?

&gt;Irrelevant.

Not when you're asserting that trade would remain the same (or according to you, go up) because of the buildings alone - ignoring what would also go with them if we went down that road, so your opinions apparently aren't naive only when dealing with the royals themselves, but the buildings you're asserting would be more popular without them. You have to think on a wider scale than just dealing with the issues that would satisfy your underlying intentions - especially when your dismissals like this only seem to work when they rely on ignoring the context of your own point being addressed.

&gt;It's the best evidence there is that royal tourism is marginal. 

Considering I had to use this example to you and someone else to demonstrate that the royals are popular with tourists in any way at all, to now assert that it backs your claim is disinegious at best. 

&gt;You still have failed to quantify the monarchy it terms of hard cash.

And you've failed to show that the royals have no influence on tourist site visits, to the extent that your now complaining that there isn't *further* data when you haven't produced any of your own.

&gt;500m£? A fudged dishonest figure. 

Could be. But you also can't show that the royals don't have any effect on why this is at £500m in the first place. You're currently relying on a theory that doesn't fit the facts.

&gt;Got anything else? ""BUT THE POSTCARDS!!!111."" No.

Considering you're in the position of 'got anything *at all*?', but still riding the 'got anything else?' train, you have to address my query before asking for more in return.

&gt;I have never said they 'mean nothing'. 

Your comments so far would suggest otherwise.

&gt;My position is that the argument of keeping the monarchy because it is a driver of tourism is at best weak, and at worst non-existant.

Which you can't back up.

&gt; It shouldn't be used to legitimise the existence of monarchy. 

No, there are several other ways to do that - you could ask people, for example; most UK people certainly seem to like them but not (I would suggest) to the point of standing whenever the national anthem is played. But that's a seperate discussion, and the fact that you've repeated your overall view as if that somehow adds weight to your assumptions doesn't change the problem of it *not actually doing so*.

&gt;Read that last part again, I'll quote it so you definitely don't miss it:

So you've stated (more than once) your opinion despite not being able to back it up with any data or surverys of your own, and your ultimate solution is to repeat yourself for a third time?

&gt;This ends the discussion.

An admmission that speed traps are about cash, not safety.

Flashing your headlights at an oncoming vehicle may be a genuine attempt to alert that road user to your presence (or, though not technically legal, to some unknown hazard on the road). Such a use of headlights is perfectly legal and is covered in the highway code as is the use of your horn.

If the speed trap is about road safety, the use of such tactics by other road users will slow down approaching traffic, the ultimate desired effect of the authorities in the first place.

But no, the authorities don't want to make the roads safer or the traffic slower. They want to fine people who are speeding, in essence closing the barn door after the horse has bolted.

Fining people who are ultimately contributing to road safety is an admission of the true motives of speed traps.

A greater percentage are now than was historically the case because of political policies implemented during the Thatcher era, which has meant fewer and fewer places are available for them to establish longer term sites.  They do have [an unfortunate reputation](http://dosta.org/node/68), but it's not clear the extent to which this is a cause of the prejudice they experience or results from it.  For example, clearly there are Romani thieves, but there are also many many Romani who do not steal and there are many non-Romani who do.  The prejudice they have historically experienced and continue to experience today is also obviously a significant driver to poor attitudes towards the rest of society and many if not all of the behaviours which go with it.  Also, official policies towards them, and economic changes have caused particular hardships and increased rates of anomie, crime, drug and alcohol dependency etc.  Not an excuse, but some way towards an explanation?

Expecting them to assimilate is almost asking the impossible, to my mind.

Many years ago they had a scheme in which you got one on one help from an ""adviser"" who had a budget to spend on getting you the resources to get work - a suit, tools, transport etc. and in return you would sign off for a minimum of 13 weeks. 

I am aware that some people got their money (which was equivalent, more or less, to 13 weeks of dole) and lived off that before signing on after the 13 week period. Others, who could survive the 13 weeks of no cash got a car or some gear as their bribe. 

This brought down the unemployment numbers (I think the 13 week break meant that you were a new case when signing on and not long-term unemployed) for the government and the unemployed (in the good old days of being *unemployed* rather than a *jobseeker*, I think this was, UB40 and everything...) got a little bonus for playing along. 

A large employment agency was involved in running the scheme, I am pretty sure they got a juicy bonus for helping to juke the stats and the ""advisors"" got a cut too.

true,ClampingNomads,null,null,"True. Most of us know very little, really, about where *most* stuff comes from!

I suppose my point is that many people express strong opinions about where their food comes from. (For the sakeof this point, let's leave out the ""health"" side of the argument). 

I think it's great that so many people are sufficiently interested in animal welfare, and organic food etc. to actually modify their consumer behaviour. I wish it happened more in other sectors (it does in some). 

But for this to have a genuine effect on the countryside they need to be informed of the facts. Or, at least, *more* informed of the facts. That way, producers will respond to market demand (rather than consumers responding to marketed supply). 

By way of examples:

Generally speaking, organic food is considered groovy and goes for a premium price compared to non-organic produce. How many people know why? What are the potential downsides of organic farming (food miles, carbon footprint)? Is an organically produced banana in the UK a groovy thing to buy? What about organic lamb from New Zealand, compared to non-organic lamb from Wales?

Many people are veggies primarily because they're concerned about animal welfare. But they drink milk and consume other dairy produce. Are they aware that a dairy cow in a modern unit is basically physiologically knackered after a few years in constant lactation? (I'd put money on being able to create 85 vegans in an afternoon. I'd do this by taking 100 vegetarians on a tour of an intensive milk unit)

Without this sort of information, producers can just knock out muddy vegetables with the word ""organic"" on the box (duly SA certified of course!) and people will buy them, along with a plastic flagon of milk with a picture of a happy cow on the side...

I agree a marketing element is inevitable, but the fact that ""grooviness"" is a marketed attribute if anything makes it more important to be educated consumers. That much of this is true of other industries doesn't make it less important for farming.

**PART THREE**

**The attacking midfielder** is one of the most coveted roles in football. Expected to be the lynchpin of any attack, the attacking midfielder must combine creative playmaking skills that can unlock defences with the ability to score goals themselves. The best player that we have in this position is Gerrard, but age and injuries have meant he is unlikely to be fit for the whole season. Jonjo Shelvey doesn't seem to be ready to take up the mantle yet, while Henderson might be better suited to a deeper position where he can distribute the ball. A strong successor to Gerrard is needed now. 

Candidates: 

While **Keisuke Honda** and **Gaston Ramirez** were listed for the right winger role, they can also play equally well as an attacking midfielder. Please refer to previous comment for analysis. 

**Gylfi Sigurdsson** (Hoffenheim) -

Pros: A hot favourite for the job, Gylfi has the advantage of having experience in the Premiership, as well as working under Brendan Rodgers. 

Cons: The ability to play well for Swansea might not translate to being good enough for Liverpool. 

Likelihood: Very high. A good relationship with the manager coupled with a low transfer fee makes him a prime target. 

**Stevan Jovetic** (Fiorentina) - 
Pros: A Stevie to replace our Stevie? A very highly rated forward who can also play anywhere in the frontline, Fiorentina's poor performance this year coupled with emerging reports that they are willing to sell him despite 4 more years remaining on his contract means that he has suddenly emerged as a popular transfer target. Touted to be the next Roberto Baggio, he will be an asset to any team. 

Cons: Expected to cost no less than 20 million, there will surely be a bidding war over him. With no Champions League, Liverpool might lose out to stronger competition for his signature. 

Likelihood: Low. But, that hair! 

(redacted)~~**Alan Dzagoev**~~ (CSKA Moscow) - 

Pros: Already considered the best thing from Russia since vodka, Dzagoev is currently showing the rest of Europe exactly how good he is. With only 6 month left on his contract, he is almost confirmed to be moving this summer. 

Cons: Everyone and their grandmothers will want a piece of him after his performance at EURO 2012. Also, some worry that like Arshavin and Pavlyuchenko, Russian players don't have a good track record in England. 

Likelihood: Very low. Once again, we might not be able to compete with some other clubs in getting his signature. His short contract means the transfer fee will not be too much of an issue, but his demand for big wages and Champions League competition will not be something we can offer. (redacted)

Whew, I can't believe I took almost a day to finish this. 

**THE END**

**EDIT**: It has been brought to my attention that my source for Dzagoev's contract was outdated, and that Dzagoev's current contract runs till 2015.

What I am trying to say is that although car safety has improved vastly over the years I agree, this is by no means uniform across all cars on the road and further more, driving skill/driver reaction time/how sensible drivers are has not.

We can pay people to stay at home but of course that isn't desirable for anyone as you say, however we also cannot force them into non-existent jobs.

The problem is demand, if there was demand then industry would hire more and be willing to train people. At the moment there is no demand and on-going austerity is just making it worse as pointed out by Krugman, Stiglitz etc.

A national economy is not a household budget, and running it like one will only lead to a death spiral of stagnation and depression as was seen in the 30's. A business can only make money when someone else is willing to spend it, when everyone is nervous and no-one is willing to spend, and the governments also refuse to spend then we end up with the current ludicrous situation where we have a lot of jobs that need doing (aging infrastructure, insufficient housing etc.) and many millions of unemployed people capable of doing them, but due to the lack of spending the jobs go undone and the unemployed people suffer in poverty.",0,1339673293,null,0,false,0,c50gkcd,t3_v1b4k,t1_c50gkcd,t1_c50gb86,null,1429140768,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

No, of course not. Speed traps exist to encourage drivers to obey the law **in general**, not just as a one off for the specific few hundred metres of road the speed trap is on.

The ""profit making"" mantra never makes any sense. Anyone who knows public sector inefficiency knows it will cost a heck of a lot more than £60 or whatever it is to issue a speeding fine.

These are the people that speedtraps are the half-assed solution to.  There needs to be an emphasis on careless driving as a whole, inclusive of excessive speed.

In all honesty, it is just like any other average large metropolitan area.  There are good areas and bad areas.  Stay out of the bad areas and you are fine.  Ask the people at your hotel if there is any place to stay away from.

As many others have mentioned, try and stay in the ""Inner Harbor"" area.  This is a lively and fun place to stay and it is a short 4-6 block walk from M&amp;T Bank stadium.  

On the harbor there are a lot of attractions: a bad ass aquarium, live music, historic ships, a science center, a nearby art museum, and a ton of good restaurants.

If you head west from the harbor, you run into the stadium.  Right around the stadium are several bars.  This is where people go drinking before baseball and american football games.  These places are probably where you want to be on game day.

East of the harbor (along the harbor's north end) are places you might want to check out at night.  As you head east along the harbor you will first hit Little Italy, where there is an abundance of delicious food.  Past this is Fell's Point where there is a ton of pubs, live music, and night life.

If you are really scared you'll be comforted by the large police station a few blocks north of the harbor and the world famous John's Hopkins hospital located a mile or two north east of the harbor.  (The hospital part is a joke, you are not getting stabbed or shot)

If we then say to that person, ""Oh, we've decided that we'd like you to do 30 hours of work a week for no extra money"", they've gone from not working to working, with no additional money being given to them.  This is, by its very definition, slave labour - they're doing work and not being paid for it.

I agree that the work ethic, purpose and self-worth that you talk about is absolutely essential, but that can be found by applying for work, maybe looking at training and skill development, etc.  Hell, if someone really can't find a job then there's certainly nothing to stop them from doing voluntary work with charities, outreach groups, etc.  But that should be a matter of personal choice, not something that is foisted upon them.

There are definitely some problems with the current system, and certain people absolutely play the system to the max, but those figures are a tiny percentage and should be dealt with in isolation.  I think it's wrong to introduce a sweeping measure which would affect everyone who is currently unfortunate enough to be out of work.

I'm also of the opinion that this is a slippery slope.  Once we decide that the unemployed should be forced to 'earn their benefits', what next?  Do we think the disabled should earn their benefits too?  What about child benefit?  Should that be earned as well?

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"But motorways do have restrictions against slow vehicles. You can't ride a moped, drive a tractor etc on a motorway because of their low speed. And while 70mph is a limit, not a target, it should surely still be a requirement of any car to be able to go that fast. There isn't a written legal requirement to keep a certain speed, but police can and will ticket you for going too slowly on a motorway if it is causing problems. I would guess that 55mpg would be a cut-off, since that's the speed many lorries go.

Cars certainly need the capability to go 70, and to be able to accelerate well. For instance, often it's necessary to speed up in order to allow somebody to enter off a slip road. Changing lanes isn't always possible, and braking is a bad idea in general (causes other people to slow down, tailbacks etc).

And I'm surprised by your observation. I routinely overtake people doing 70 in the left lane, and often I'm overtaken by people who must be doing 100+.

Personally I think speed limits on motorways or A roads are a stupid idea. They're so abritrary and don't apply a lot of the time. The actual safe limit can vary so much depending on traffic, weather, your car etc etc. Sometimes I wouldn't dare go 70, but on a totally clear sunday afternoon with no traffic, 70mph is pedestrian.

I also agree that going too slow on a motorway can be dangerous, but I don't think that being able to do 70 should be a requirement. After all, there are three lanes on a motorway for a reason and I think that while drivers should be confident on the road, pressuring them to keep to a minimum speed of say, 55mph, would only cause more problems for people that may not be able to go that fast not through choice of car, but by demeanor whilst not having much of an influence on drivers whom have the confidence and ability to do so. 

(I feel now I have written it that people not confident in driving at such speeds would be a danger unto themselves on the motorway but I think the sentiment still stands)

May I suggest we agree to disagree, after all, we are both supporting the same overall cause.

To quote one of my favourite books, _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_:

&gt;If you, reader, had been one of the hands, would you have slogged? Or would you have preferred to starve and see your family starve? If you had been in Crass's place, would you have resigned rather than do such dirty work? If you had had Hunter's berth, would you have given it up and voluntarily reduced yourself to the level of the hands? If you had been Rushton, would you rather have become bankrupt than treat your 'hands' and your customers in the same way as your competitors treated theirs?

&gt; It may be that, so placed, you--being the noble-minded paragon that you are--would have behaved unselfishly. But no one has any right to expect you to sacrifice yourself for the benefit of other people who would only call you a fool for your pains. It may be true that if any one of the hands--Owen, for instance--had been an employer of labour, he would have done the same as other employers. __Some people seem to think that proves that the present system is all right! But really it only proves that the present system compels selfishness.__ (emphasis added)

&gt; One must either trample upon others or be trampled upon oneself. Happiness might be possible if everyone were unselfish; if everyone thought of the welfare of his neighbour before thinking of his own. But as there is only a very small percentage of such unselfish people in the world, the present system has made the earth into a sort of hell. Under the present system there is not sufficient of anything for everyone to have enough. Consequently there is a fight--called by Christians the 'Battle of Life'. In this fight some get more than they need, some barely enough, some very little, and some none at all. The more aggressive, cunning, unfeeling and selfish you are the better it will be for you. As long as this 'Battle of Life' System endures, we have no right to blame other people for doing the same things that we are ourselves compelled to do.

as depressing as that is, in relation to your original question (do I believe they are lazy scroungers), I am certainly inclined to believe that the younger generation are lazier than the elder. 

But besides that, the younger generation have had years in university getting bullshit degrees that are of no use. (this is not all their fault, the govt. bears a lot of the blame, and the universities themselves). so they actually also lack employable skills and abilities.

The problem is that there is no money being spent in the economy, because unemployment and lowered wages, etc. means that consumers cannot afford to purchase the goods being produced. Which in turn makes more businesses fail, etc. - until the only businesses really growing are the luxury businesses, which don't take a loss because the wealthy get more money through lower wages (technically the difference between the value of the product of the labour and the wages paid).

So if you do take the wealth from the super-rich and give it to consumers directly, you will get more demand, because it makes a mass market viable (i.e. you can sell huge numbers of goods - one very rich person won't buy 5000 cars, 5000 well-off people might).

true,veedy,lfc99,,"Hey, as a Maryland native (closer to DC, but I visit Baltimore often and have friends there) i'll try to give a little insight for you and anyone else visiting that day.

. 

Baltimore does have a bad reputation as an unsafe city, and while it's true that the city has changed significantly over the past few years for the better, you still need to be careful. People here have suggested the Inner Harbor and Fells Point, and those are great suggestions. They're safe, interesting, and full of great restaurants and bars.

Just keep your wits about you like you would in most urban areas. There are homeless people who ask for money, and some of them might follow you down the street yelling or bugging you if you decline. Just ignore them, but don't be a dick. Also, i've seen rats the size of cats around the city here and there. Just...run.



The food in Fells Point and the Inner Harbor is very good. The Inner Harbor area has this sort of central plaza area right on the water that has a ton of food. Jump on Yelp and search around, there's a lot of great bars and restaurants to go after the game.

.

If you get some time to tour around while you're there, the Inner Harbor is the place to be. They have historic ships on the water that you can walk around in, including the USS Constellation (!) and a submarine. A MUST see is the National Aquarium. Absolutely awesome, probably one of the best aquariums in the country. Jump on Wikitravel for a good idea about the big attractions. 

Washington, D.C. is also just an hour to the south. If you get a chance and you haven't been there yet, definitely go see our nation's capital. If anyone wants some tips about DC, let me know, i'm much more familiar with that city.

.

The stadium is located in South Baltimore. Go see Fort McHenry. Do it. Fort McHenry prevented the British from invading Baltimore during the War of 1812, and is one of the turning points in the war that led to the peace treaty. Francis Scott Key watched the defense of Fort McHenry from a nearby ship, and was inspired to write the words for the ""Star-Spangled Banner,"" our national anthem. American or British, that war was an important event in the relationship between our two nations.

At Ravens Stadium (M &amp; T Bank Stadium), definitely get some Boardwalk Fries. Throw some Old Bay seasoning on it, that's how we eat it in Maryland and it's delicious. In the past, the stadium areas used to not be the best place to be after dark. Now, things are better. But why are you going to be there at night? Head over to Federal Hill or back to the Inner Harbor or Fells Point for food and drinks!

.

true,neonmantis,null,Derby International,"And do you support that idea? What do you think will happen when people start to starve? And don't pretend all people on benefits have holidays and playstations, they don't. Some families with lots of kids do okay, but think of a 26 year old man on benefits at £60 a week. 

Why can't we afford it? Benefits cost £6bn a year whilst we let £196bn a year escape through tax evasion and avoidance. Shut down those loopholes and these people can stay on benefits and we still have £188bn to spend on what we like. Or maybe we should stop bombing shepherds in afghanistan? Or maybe we could stop gifting tens of billions to the IMF that just get gifted to the banks. Or maybe when we bailed out the banks we should have made them pay us back when they start turning a profit again. It is just igbnorance to say there is no money, we have choices where we spend it. 

get educated? - shit governments whacked all the costs up, nevermind. get training - who's paying for that then, you just said you want them to cut all benefits. not all of us have rich relatives. Just to reiterate, this is your solution?

true,TheYellowBastard,null,null,"&gt;I am not sure I can see your logic however, how can 2.5 (ish) million, applying for 500 000(generous ish) jobs not seems like 'not enough' jobs?

But there are so many questions, how many of those 2.5 million are doing cash in hand work? How many are drug dealing but still on the dole, How many steal and sell things to pay the bills but are still on the dole. A great number of those 2.5 million might have unofficial jobs.

If there are 2.5 million birds that can't find food and every day I put out 500'000 pieces of bread, but none of those birds eat any of it, I'm not going to keep throwing more on top until there is one piece of bread for every bird. Nor am I going to sympathise with birds who say there is no food anywhere.

I really think the government should only be criticised about a low number of jobs when the thousands on offer have been taken, maybe if there were literally no jobs the government would have something up its sleeve or those extra 500'000 in work would boost the economy enough to create more jobs.

Think about were to look for work, I started in Burnley and Bolton but there are a lot more jobs in Manchester and other cities, and the pay is higher, yes you might pay more in car costs and see family that little bit less, but it's about priorities. If your dream job is a 2 hour train ride away, wake up two hours earlier and get the train, don't just dismiss the job as so many will because it's people like me who will take those jobs and sit here wondering why so many people are saying they can't get a job.

I am 28 and work in IT, I have done for 10 years, it was only recently I attained my A+, purely because exams are expensive and I've finally got a job which will pay for them all, so I'm on a qualification mission now.

I can only say what I say to the people at work, you need to start at the bottom, millions of people are good with computers with no quals, but out of those millions, only a few will do helpdesk/call centre jobs, I don't blame them because it's shitty work, but it's a start, and there are always thousands of them and they often require little to no experience.

You then keep your shitty job for a couple of years, turn up at 9 an don't leave early, gain experience and then start applying for better jobs, and your potentially new employer can now see you take your shit seriously, you have a glowing reference, you're never late, you can work in a team etc etc.

In my experience the man with 5 years experience in IT jobs with no qualifications will get a job over a guy who has got all the qualifications but has no work experience.

All the jobs I applied for said you had to have at least MS70-680/685, I didn't have it, but I'm still going to apply for the jobs, it's up to me to show that I'm capable of passing it if required through my CV and my personality if I get an interview.

This is another thing that puts people off, they see things like experience required and qualifications required and don't apply, fuck that, apply for everything, if there are 200 IT jobs in your area apply for them all even if you don't think you'll get them, if you have the skills you say you do someone somewhere will spot that and give you a chance.

It is so easy to get a job in IT if you are charismatic, so many IT people sit in their house all day doing nothing other than computers and talking on forums, they are socially inept, argumentative and condescending quite a lot of the time, so much of our feedback reflects that, candidates being told there are more qualified people who have applied but our candidate was personable, friendly and would fit well into a team.

Even if you can't get a job, knock up a flyer, get it copied and deliver it door to door, offer your IT services, maybe it takes off like a rocket, maybe you get no response, but it's always worth a try, and it's something else for the CV, it shows initiative and desire.

Even other sorts of jobs in office environments, data entry, general administration etc, you might apply to just do the photocopying and over time it becomes apparent your good with IT, the IT guy leaves and you have a chance.

Always remember the little things that people really don't think is a big deal.

Is your CV nicely done, send to off to employers, ask for honest critical feedback about your CV, ensure its the best it can be.

Send cover letter when applying for jobs, again make sure they are well written and look the part.

Understand what need to be on your CV and cover letter If I had a pound for every person I've told to re-write a CV because its garbage...you get the idea.

Go to interviews clean shaven, smelling nice, in smart clean clothes, shirt, tie, shiny shoes the lot.

If you have lots of tattoos, cover that shit up, if you have piercings take them out, if you have a cool guy hair cut really think about it, is it holding you back, there is a lot to be said for looking normal.

Have questions ready for the interview, and not ones about holiday days and pay rises, research the company, ask them questions, let them know you're serious and professional.

So many of our candidates don't listen to this, they turn up with holes in their ears the size of 50p's a purple mo-hawk and the same shirt they have been wearing all week and wonder why they don't get the job.
They have the ""well if they don't like me for me I don't want their job attitude""...that is retarded

Maybe I've just been lucky and I'm too naive....but I honestly don't think this is the case, because I can't stress this enough, so many people are still coming from other countries who have no experience and also can't even speak English as a first language but yet still find a job, either there is a secret job market for immigrants or the English public just aren't trying as hard as they should be.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Why can't we afford it? Benefits cost £6bn a year whilst we let £196bn a year escape through tax evasion and avoidance. 

do you have a link for this? I'd like to look into these figures. 

having said that, there is a major difference even if your figures were good; the 6bn is already in our pockets, the 196bn is not. you can spend money you don't have, so at the very least we cannot maintain benefits at the current rate until we get that 196bn in the coffers. I wouldn't hold your breath on that.

of course we have choices where we spend money, but there is a limit to our money. I'd happily pull out of Afghanistan, the EU, stop gifting money to the IMF and agree we should never have bailout out a bank. but that doesn't mean we shouldn't also deal with a broken system that lets a whole generation sit at home because it makes more sense for them *not* to work. 

&gt; get educated? - shit governments whacked all the costs up, nevermind. get training - who's paying for that then, you just said you want them to cut all benefits. not all of us have rich relatives. Just to reiterate, this is your solution?

not a solution. why is it my job, or anyones, to solve all the worlds problems? This is the reality, and we all have to deal with it. it doesn't matter how much you cry that it isn't fair, or it's really hard, because you only need to look at Greece, or if you're really brave somewhere like India, to see that nobody owes you a living. 

what was your solution again? apart from eating the rich.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"O.K well let me give an example of how this programme could work if it was implemented properly. A friend of mine set up private recruitment company last year, him and his business partner currently make around 100k a year between them and are considering expanding and taking on new staff. To do so is a risk, as the new staff will need to bring in enough business to cover the costs of employing them, overheads attached and the time invested to train them (potentially lost money on their part as they could be generating more business instead of training). So to do this they need to have enough capital saved to pay for all these overheads up front in case the employee is not suitable and actually loses them money. 

In their position at the moment the safest way to expand is to find someone experienced who will have an almost certain chance of meeting the targets required and take minimal time to train and can help grow the business straight away. The idea of going to a job centre and finding an employee who has been out of work for a long period, has no experience in the industry and risk losing money on someone not capable of doing the job well enough is too big compared to the alternative of hiring someone with experience. But the fact is a percentage of people on the dole will probably be capable of doing the job very well after a certain amount of training.   

If the business had the option to use a workfare scheme where it could take on and train say 5 people over a ten week period with no strings attached and minimal risk involved, it would then become a fairly reasonable expansion strategy. If say at the end of the ten weeks training only two of the five people were hitting targets and making money for the business, it would be an obvious decision to keep them on as paid employee's and use them to continue to grow the business. The other three would still walk away with some solid sales experience and training which the could be built on and the company would have limited their risk significantly and expanded at a rate which is faster than they could have done otherwise, taking on people that would not have got the chance to get into that industry.

How would this not be a good thing?           ",0,1339687392,null,0,1339688322,0,c50ithf,t3_uzt04,t1_c50ithf,t1_c5027wq,null,1429141835,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The £6bn isn't even strictly in our pockets when we're borrowing money every year. I don't know why your telling me not to hold my breath, you asked for a solution and I offered you one. Collect the taxes we are due from corps and then we can stop chasing the poor to fix problems they can't solve. There is a limit to spending, but we could easily increase spending in social areas by stopping supporting all the things we agree we shouldn't be funding. By all means deal with the broken system, but deal with it, don't point fingers at the people least responsible for the problem who are also least able to effect it. The fact that it makes sense for them not to work show how far salaries have actually dropped over the years, benefits have kept up with inflation, wages haven't. 

kindly fuck off with your ""crying"" allegations, what's your point here? god forbid anyone gives a fuck or shows compassion for other people ffs. the reality is whatever we create as you admit so i don't know why you're pointing as if it cannot be changed, especially as we've both pointed out how it eminently can be changed. And don't start telling people to learn about things when you clearly don't know what they know or not. I work for a charity, always have, and am actually moving to Sri Lanka in August to work for one there so with respect, I know about poor people here and abroad. 

What is wrong with eating the rich? We have enough food here to feed everyone, yet the rich waste it. Is it such an abominable idea to share? It is not my fault that the rich have taken so much of the earth that the only real choice now is to focibly take it back. 

What got us into this? An economic and political system that is designed to benefit the establishment and is built on a tower of debt that inevitably collapses. History shows us debt builds up and collapses, in fact it used to be the case that the Romans would wipe the debts and start again every 100 years. We could do the same.

It takes a strange person to hold prejudice against a generic looking clean shaven man, how ever it's not impossible to comprehend that some employers just won't be in to that sort of thing.

You might find yourself in a position where you were neck and neck with a different candidate and it just so happens they thought the other guy looked smarter than you.

I have a beard myself, a chinstrap beard, and I love it and look retarded without it, how ever for every interview I've ever had I will shave it off as it will generally grow back to how I like it in 3 weeks or so. If I get the job then I'll let the beard grow back, not getting a job because of a beard is plausible, being fired for growing a beard is a different thing all together.

Don't mess about with CV agencies, just apply for lots and lots of jobs, if you get an interview and don;t get the job, ask for feedback on your CV an dinterview technique, if you get a letter or a phonecall saying you haven't been slelected for interview, write them back or ask them for feedback on your CV, it's the people giving out the jobs who's opinion you want.

Granted you might not hear much back, but you can't lose anything, and it makes you look good, you might apply to the same company one day, and they might remember you as the guy who was so serious about getting a good job he called in and asked for feedback.

&gt;if you got in 10 years ago when the market was better then you gained the experience and can exploit that now

It possibly was better but the same still applies of my 10/12 years in IT only 2 of those have been in jobs earning more than minimum wage, other than those years it's been £11'000-£12'000 a year hating every second. I've worked in the call centres, done customer returns, packed computers in factories, swept the floors, taken the rubbish out etc.

Even now the wife will complain that I do to much for my employer, ""once it gets to 17:00 I should just go home"" ""why are you checking your work phone you've finished"" that's not an attitude I agree with, if it means staying until 17:37 to finish a job, I will, for free because I can either be the guy who does the minimum amount of work or the guy who will go above and beyond to help his team.

And then there is the other aspect that is creeping into the work place, people hate heir shitty jobs so decide they are stressed or depressed and go on the sick or they know the ins and outs of employment law and will take advantage of the smallest thing, ""my monitor is too small"" ""this chair isn't erganomic"" ""this mouse gives me RSI I need a track ball, I have a doctors note"" ""the air conditioning is giving me a cold, I've contacted my union rep"" We've all seen or heard this sort of silly bull shit.

 As said, I've had the shitty jobs working for the bosses clueless nephew etc every day I could have just said 'fuck this' and walked out, but I didn't, I did what people have been doing for generations, kept my head down and just went with it.

It's far too easy to be unemployed now a days there are so many excuses to use, excuses that 50 years ago would have you fired on the spot for even having the balls to use it.

We live in an age where you can be a heroin addict, punch your boss spit on his wife, but still remain employed because an employer has a right to support you etc...granted that is an extreme example, but you get what I mean.

To summarise, don't be a person who chooses to take one of the many cliché excuses for not finding and/or keeping a job, because at least for now there are still a lot of people who will just suck their problems up and get on with it.",0,1339690820,null,0,false,0,c50jn60,t3_v1b4k,t1_c50jn60,t1_c50j5x8,null,1429142310,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Summer - Pre-season aims at Tottenham Hotspur are to finish in the top 4, thus securing qualification to the Champions League.

September/November/December - Despite losing their first two games against Man City and Man United, Tottenham have the best start to a season in living memory, Harry Redknapp universally regarded as a legend after mounting surprise title challenge, Fergie declares Tottenham are playing ""the best football in the league"", Daniel Levy + co begin drafting The H Bombs new contract.

January - Tottenhams title challenge continues with spectacular football and great results. Highlights include possibly the most entertaining game of the season, a 3-2 last-minute defeat against eventual title winners, financial powerhouse Man City.

February - Contract negotiations continue between Harry and Daniel. Harry Redknapp has his day in court for long-running tax evasion case. Found innocent in law. Publicly thanks Tottenham Hotspur and Daniel Levy for standing by him throughout the affair when other clubs might not have. Later that day news breaks that Fabio has resigned from his position as manager of the England national team. Media pounce on Redknapp as his natural replacement, the 'peoples choice'. That weekend Tottenham beat Newcastle (4th place rivals) 5-0 in their first match with Harry back at the helm, in what will become known as the greatest false dawn in the history of the EPL(?).

March - After a draw against Stevenage in the FA Cup then a 5-2 humbling at Arsenal, Spurs reach the back-end of their campaigns most challenging run of fixtures with an unlucky loss against Manchester United. Contract negotiations between The Red Napkin and Daniel Levy stall after The H Bomb fails to distance himself from the England role and implies he would accept the job if it was offered to him.

April - Tottenham fall out of the Top 3 for the first time in the season with losses against QPR and Norwich, as well as enduring an extremely contentious demolition against nemesis club Chelsea in the FA Cup. Fans and board alike continue to be frustrated by Harry Redknapps courting of the England position. 

May - Roy Hodgson appointed England manager. Harry Redknapp hears it on the radio on a Sunday morning. Tottenham rally round for the big finish  Hard work and spirit yields a top four finish thanks to a victory against Fulham on the last day of the season, thus fulfilling the club's objective of qualifying for the champions league.

One week later nemesis billionaire club Chelsea F.C. grind out a surprise victory against a superior Bayern Munich team in the CL final, thus qualifying for the champions league despite finishing 6th in the EPL (at the expense of Tottenham).

June - Harry Redknapp reveals he only has one year left on his contract. States that had he been offered the role he would have had to have taken the England job, but also stresses that he loves club football and loves what he is doing at Tottenham. Two weeks later he is sacked.

It was taught by giving you a small booklet on a certain topic, you worked through it, you went to the side of the classroom and picked up the next booklet.  When you finished all the booklets at that level you filled in a test booklet and the teacher would mark it.  If you passed you went onto the next level of booklets.  There was little to no teaching until the 14-15 age range.  And when I say little to none I literally can't remember any beyond the teacher telling people to be quiet.  We still got As, the school appeared in the top third of the league tables,  but the difference between the teaching at 6th Form maths and highschool was immense.  I was actually surprised when my 6th form teacher not only knew the subject but clearly also knew maths and had a degree in it.

Having said that you could probably become a qualified accountant in a year and you'd only need to find a few small businesses to become self employed.  I've often wondered why if there's not enough jobs out there then why people don't just circumvent the problem and make one.  I only mention it because I have a relative that literally did that only they didn't have a maths degree.

As such the notion of it being suspicious is in and of itself pointless. There's no distinction between suspicious and not suspicious since the latter never occurs. 

Yeah, but this is just bullshit.  He formed Wikileaks in 2006, but was only in the public eye significantly after the disclosures at the end of 2010 for a year or so, and then charged with rape.  What are the odds that a random Australian will be charged with rape in any given year?  Kind of low I'd suspect.

&gt;What is your point?

We can say that one of the two women he is accused of molesting previously worked for a known US security service funded anti-Castro outfit.  Doesn't mean she's lying, but it sure goes to her credibility given the suspicion is these charges are politically motivated and the US and its security services are calling the shots.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Tax evasion costs 15x more than benefits 

this is a big and complicated subject, but I'm afraid your initial claims seem to be well off the mark. 

The link you provided shows tax evasion (15bn - you originally said 196bn?) vs. benefit *fraud* (1bn). 

You also originally said 'benefits cost £6bn a year' which I took to mean the whole benefits system. did I misunderstand? [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11466178) is a good breakdown of the different kinds of benefits available and what they cost. taken together they total well over 6bn a year. 

&gt; I don't know why your telling me not to hold my breath, you asked for a solution and I offered you one. 

I am not sure your solution is even economically viable. if you clarify what you meant then I can evaluate it more accurately. at the moment it doesn't look to me like reclaiming tax evasion would even cover benefits. 

&gt; kindly fuck off with your ""crying"" allegations, what's your point here? god forbid anyone gives a fuck or shows compassion for other people ffs. 

don't get so riled up, I never meant it personally. my point was that the world has changed, we're out of cash, and a worldview based on 'fairness' is not subject to hard economic facts.

&gt; I work for a charity, always have, and am actually moving to Sri Lanka in August to work for one there so with respect, I know about poor people here and abroad.

well I commend you for that, and I myself have done charity work abroad. I did not mean to imply *you* didn't know about poverty, but rather than those on benefits in this country clearly have no idea (when compared to India for example). 

&gt; It is not my fault that the rich have taken so much of the earth that the only real choice now is to focibly take it back.

this is where your worldview gets scary. forcibly take it back? where do you stop? you said tax evasion at first, but why stop there? (in fact you couldn't stop there, because it only brings in peanuts).

if they have 2 houses, why not forcibly take one? Why not nationalise their businesses? who decides levels of fairness and what about the right of peoples property? I waste food sometimes, should you be allowed to take my salary? who defines ""rich""?

&gt; What got us into this? An economic and political system that is designed to benefit the establishment and is built on a tower of debt that inevitably collapses. History shows us debt builds up and collapses, in fact it used to be the case that the Romans would wipe the debts and start again every 100 years. We could do the same.

even better than writing off debt, we could build an economy on real value, not debt. we could let people buy what they want, and let industry develop to fulfil those needs. 

I think what got us into this mess was indeed debt. But the only way to fulfil your solution is to borrow more. that's solving a problem by administering more of the problem.",0,1339696669,null,0,false,0,c50l6hq,t3_v1b4k,t1_c50l6hq,t1_c50j6q9,null,1429143012,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He had been in the public eye long before he came to Sweden. The last major release was 4-5 months before he arrived. We're back at him being unaccusable. Again you have failed to realise that just calling something ""bullshit"" doesn't make it so.

&gt;What are the odds that a random Australian will be charged with rape in any given year? Kind of low I'd suspect.

I don't know. Nor do I know how it's relevant. It's  some weird form of circular reasoning. He can't be guilty because it's unlikely that an Australian is arrested for rape. But the same would surely be true for all Australians. 

&gt;We can say that one of the two women he is accused of molesting previously worked for a known US security service funded anti-Castro outfit.

No, she worked with them. And the US was not their only funders as far as I know. It's proof of absolutely nothing. Can you honestly not see how retarded it is to draw a line between the two?

&gt;Doesn't mean she's lying, but it sure goes to her credibility given the suspicion is these charges are politically motivated

If this is the case I know plenty of poor people. We would consider ourselves poor, I think. And I know a lot of people with the same, or similar, economic conditions of my family or my extended family. Their situation, while similar economically, is often much worse. This is usually because they live in filth. I've seen lots of families who claim to have this horribly hard time in life and yet make double in income to what my aunt makes. My aunt lives in the Appalachian mountain chain, a very very poor area of the US, but her house is clean and nice, and she lives comfortably.


I'm rambling some, but my point is that while many people in the US are poor and have horrific lives, I think a lot of times the horrific part isn't because of the economic situation but because of their lifestyles.

Honestly, this attitude is part of the problem.  People are already doing this - it's just that when somebody says it's not in their interest to go back to work because childminding is so expensive.

There are those out there who simply just feel Eccleston was a horrible doctor. I disagree in that he was never a horrible doctor, he was just quickly eclipsed by the sheer magnificence of Tennant. The bigger issue was the production values of the first season. The footage is quality, but nothing special. The special effects are cheesy. And the worst thing in my opinion was the musical score. In the later seasons you have grand orchestral machinations, where is the beginning you have a guy twanging on a banjo.

That being said when I introduced my friend to Dr. Who I made him watch the first season. I think you really cheapen the experience of the following season by not watching the beginning.

We need to find some replacements pretty soon to fill the gap between McEcheran and Lamps. Modric fills that gap pretty well, I think. 
I think RDM could rotate Lamps and Modric so that way Lamps gets a lot of play time and becomes top Chelsea scorer in history(He's about 30 goals away, I think) and put Modric in so that way he gets the hang of the type of game that Chelsea play. 
Another option would be putting 5 midfielders so you have Lamps and Modric controlling the game with passes and amazing balls to Torres, or whomever RDM decides to put up front, and you have Mata making runs on the side with maybe Ramires on the other side as well, and you put Hulk or maybe Hazard as an Attacking midfielder. It would probably require a lot of change but I think this is the only way which wouldn't require the benching of really good players.

That's £200 a week. Before tax. Before business rates. Before cover for sickness and holidays, before training, before insurance and so on.

But then, given that our banks are the most indebted in the world, and asset prices are under unprecedented pressure, it's no wonder that the decision to monetise private debt (as well as the government debt to which previous QE has been directed) is going to happen. 

The reality is that this is the end of any sort of credibility. From now on, you should assume that the printing presses will be the first port of call (indeed the only port of call) for reducing the debt burden, whether private or public. I just hope that they can reduce it to a sustainable level without a chaotic loss of confidence in our currency.

This paragraph in particular is the closest my point gets to being addressed:
&gt;This paradox of rising ‘gun crime’ in the wake of a ban on the private ownership of
handguns prompted some ill-informed criticism (especially from certain American
commentators) on the peverse effects of handgun prohibition, although, more recently,
the contribution of a wide range of ‘unorthodox’ firearms types (imitation handguns,
converted imitation handguns, reactivated firearms, converted air pistols, BB gun/airsoft
weapons, deactivated firearms, blank firers, converted and unconverted blank-firing
starting pistols, CS gas and pepper sprays) to the ‘gun crime’ statistics has become
increasingly apparent. For example, in 2006–2007, handguns, shotguns and rifles
comprised 26 per cent of the firearms offences recorded by the police, suggesting that
the remaining 74 per cent was comprised of the complex array of types mentioned above
(Kaiza, 2008: 48). In one sense, this suggests a form of ‘weapon displacement’ occurring.",0,1339705551,null,0,false,0,c50nnpd,t3_v0cfo,t1_c50nnpd,t1_c50nfts,null,1429144179,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If there's 2 additional kids you can work from home.

- You are registered as a childminder and as self-employed. 

- That means there are no business rates.

- For training there is government grants in place.

- If they're looking after at least one child full time they also qualify for 33% off their heating and lighting bill, and 10% off their council tax...

- You are allowed a 'reasonable amount' of food *without* receipts to be tax deductible.

- You can claim up to 10% of your child minding income back for household goods and furnishings for wear and tear. 

- There's also the annual investment allowance up to £25k, so toys and entertainment and activities for own kid just got *a lot* cheaper if they learn to share, so the tax burden has dropped down again.

- The qualification to be working from home and a qualified nanny.  You're talking voluntary registration and training of less than £500 and there's government grants available for the unemployed.

BIM52751 - Care providers: Childminders: expenses

*Someone saying childminding costs are too expensive to justify going back to work is no longer a valid excuse.*

If they can't afford to go back to work and pay £30 a day childcare, they can stay at home and work, receive deductions on food, toys, heating, lighting, even petrol and telephone, receive £40 a day, only pay tax and NI after they cleared the normal personal allowance limit, and free up another two adults to enter the work place in the same position but can afford £20 a day from their wage, reducing the state welfare cost further.  If other places are charging £30 they may well choose to even offer the same rate for people who can afford the little extra but can't find a place and be quids in, with a salary equivalent to that of just under a £25k job and if you were having to pay for childcare.  

The HMRevenue uses figures for people working from home that calculates using 6 kids - so there's considerable room for expansion too.  Like I said, that's a considerably cheap business start up, and, as far as a bank manager would be concerned, an active business model. 

http://www.nicma.org/cms/publications/HMRC%20Childminders.pdf

&gt;Have a word with yourself son.

Bet you're wishing you hadn't been so condescending now.  Kinda makes you look a bit of an idiot when you're talking about business rates for someone who claims they can't afford £30 childcare so they have to stay on benefits.  ""As someone who doesn't need or have interest in child minding, do you honestly think you have solved the childcare issue,"" - I actually know that the solution is already out there and has been provided for, it's just people find it easier to make excuses. 

I don't claim to have solved it after 10 minutes on the Internet.  
I claim that it has already been sorted and it is already in place, if people are willing to work, and that people are doing it already.

£200 per week is 10K a year. It's not a great living. It's why no one with any business sense does it.

You haven't taken into consideration the fact it is a vocation. Not every parent can or wants to take care of other people's kids, it takes a certain skillset to cope.

And you still have to find two people to pay £800 a month for childcare.  You're offering to save people £50 a week to go with a childminder who is just in it for the money. Good luck with that.  Kids are considered precious by most parents. Google the perceptual value matrix.

You are also ignoring the fact that any parent with the business sense to accomplish this, has the capacity to earn far more than 10K a year once their kids reach school age. Keeping ""their hand in"" or fear of losing steady employment and never getting back in is therefore more serious a consideration in the long term than any short term financial gain running a childminder service.

If they can't afford 30 a day, it means they have 2 kids under 5, or twins or triplets, or they earn poor money already.  If they have more than 1 kid, that means their earning capacity under your scheme just dropped to 5K a year. 

If they earn poor money already, they are either poorly skilled, in which case few would choose them as a childminder, or they live in a poor area, in which case few who could afford their services would find them.

Seriously, every fucking parent has thought about this. Long and hard. Every parent.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I like AVB but my worry with him is man management. I know he's very gifted tactically and he's incredibly meticulous and cerebral. Furthermore his footballing philosophy is much more in-line with ours than it was with Chelsea.

But he's only 34 with no experience as a player at a high level, and really only ~2 years of top-tier management under his belt. I know our situation isn't the same as Chelsea's and perhaps our players would be more receptive to this type of manager, but I just get this ominous feeling when I think of how AVB would navigate a drop in form. 

On one hand I think he probably learned a lot from the Chelsea experience, and I also think he'd do a lot better without an eccentric meddling Russian oil baron breathing down his neck. 

On the other, there's still going to be a lot of pressure. Like him or not, Harry had a very successful reign as manager and fans will surely want to keep moving in the right direction. 

I do think it's time to insert a relatively youngish manager who can implement a concrete philosophy and be given time to do so. I really liked Rodgers because he has that sort of sentimental ""arm around the shoulder"" style but he combines it with a consistent approach and good organization. But since that's no longer an option, I guess I wouldn't be upset with AVB or even Martinez or Moyes. 

Moyes is IMO the safe option--though still obviously a risk. He's 49, an age that's young enough to install a ""culture"" if he's given time, but not so young as to be naive. Experience, organization, motivation. Can he change his mentality and approach to best utilize a superior squad? Can he buck Everton's trend of starting extremely poorly but adjusting and finishing well? 

Martinez is sort of the middle ground. Young and tactically astute, but also with a very warm demeanor and some experience in England as both a player and a manager. He's shown Moyes's ability to punch above his weight, and he even plays some pretty decent football at times with a poor squad. For all the credit Rodgers gets, it was Martinez who installed the style of football that Swansea succeeded with in the Premier League. His Wigan seems to have a similar problem to Moyes's Everton though; always starting horribly only to miraculously pull it together in the nick of time.

And AVB seems a bit more like the cold and calculating type. Meticulous and cerebral, though still passionate. No experience as a professional player, and only a few years of managerial experience. Can he get the respect of the players? Can he motivate the players and navigate the inevitable spot of poor form?

As I said, I wouldn't really be opposed to any of those 3. All 3 worry me mightily, but all 3 excite me as well. And that's not even including some more out-of-left-field possibilities.

You could look at the A6144(M), a 70mph single carriageway motorway which had its motorway status removed and a new, 50mph limit imposed (despite no changes in traffic use).  Or the A57 Snake Pass, which for decades was a 60 (and extremely difficult to reach that speed) but was recently changed to a blanket 50, with immediate speed camera enforcement.  The A580 East Lancs Road, long a 60, changed to a 50 on completely empty and non-urban sections with no junctions.

These weren't changed to make the roads safer, they were changed because reducing the limit is cheaper and easier than re-engineering the roads to remove hazards and design faults.

From what you've already said I know that I know more about business than you for a start.

I said there's nothing stopping them from charging £30 if that's what other people are charging.  That's a start off £15k.  Then I said 'equivalency', because if they were having to pay £150 week in child minding that's another £7k.  They'd have to be earning £22k, and someone capable of earning £22k doesn't get to use the excuse that the cost of childcare means it is not practical for them to return to work. Then on top of that they get all the extra reductions that the £22k person doesn't get.

&gt;And you still have to find two people to pay £800 a month for childcare.

So?  Apparently there's plenty of childcare nurseries doing just that.  You have a propensity to make excuses.

&gt;You're offering to save people £50 a week to go with a childminder who is just in it for the money. Good luck with that.

See what I mean.  Presumably they like kids too if they've already had one.  So in it for the money and because they like kids.  Where's the problem there?

&gt;You are also ignoring the fact that any parent with the business sense to accomplish this, has the capacity to earn far more than 10K a year once their kids reach school age. 

You don't need business sense you need to be a functioning human being that can look after more than one child.

&gt;If they can't afford 30 a day, it means they have 2 kids under 5, or twins or triplets, or they earn poor money already. If they have more than 1 kid, that means their earning capacity under your scheme just dropped to 5K a year.

That's right.  If they're a bad parent the scheme won't work for them.  Choosing to be a dysfunctional human beings isn't an excuse either.

&gt;If they earn poor money already, 

If they earn poor money already they're not going to be using the excuse 'I don't work because child-minding is expensive'.  They're already working.  Good on 'em.

&gt;either poorly skilled, in which case few would choose them as a childminder, or they live in a poor area, in which case few who could afford their services would find them.

Bullshit and bullshit.  You think the people that work in nurseries are highly skilled?  You can fully qualified to work in a business, nevermind be self employed, in less than 12 weeks of courses, and just because somebody lives in poor area doesn't mean they can't earn an average wage by travelling out of it, as plenty of people do.  Nobody chooses a childminder because they're highly skilled, it would be gold dust.  They choose them because they're appropriately skilled functioning adults, with a pleasant, trustworthy demeanor.  It's not rocket science.  They need to be able to look after a child, not fill in my tax return form.



&gt;Seriously, every fucking parent has thought about this. Long and hard. Every parent. When you are dropping a grand a month on fees, you look at every option, but when you look at the fine detail you realise you have no other choice.

Then if they don't want to be the person who runs the business but are using the excuse that childcare is to expensive to return to work, then they just have to find someone that they trust that is happy being a stay at home mum or dad but making the equivalent of a £25k go to work mum or dad.


You don't get to say you stay at home because you can't afford childcare anymore, not unless like you say your first pregnancy resulted in more than 2 arms and legs.  And for the vast majority of people it doesn't.  Anything else and they chose it, and it's got nothing to do with unworkable prices of childcare.

You certainly are an excuse maker.  It's offensive when people like you call me son.  I'm better than that.",0,1339710449,null,0,false,0,c50oxou,t3_v1b4k,t1_c50oxou,t1_c50odkk,null,1429144781,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
