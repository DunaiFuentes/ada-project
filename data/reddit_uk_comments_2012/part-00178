Squares - The foreground image you chose was good and the lines are crisp, so I'm surprised that the background image you chose was not crisp at all! In fact, it seems low-resolution and tiled oddly (?) which is somewhat detracting from the main focus.

Font - It's not the best idea to use curly calligraphic font in anything ever. Unless it's handwritten, those fonts tend to look wooden and lacking any sort of spirit.

Song Lyrics - This would be great if it was showcasing a poem that you wrote or a quote, but song lyrics are simply come off as a bit tacky in this day and age.

The atmosphere is mostly good - best at night :) . Usually between 21:00-22:30 there arnt many people around the city centre due to shops being shut and nobody really goes to clubs that early. 
The temperature atm is about -2C so with that in mind bring warm clothes.. but it is winter. the temperature really does vary though, usually temperature is between 10-15C (i think).
There are many parks around Mnachester that people often go running in (some have trees in them), but there are also lots or gyms and most people run on pavements. 
with VAT tax it isnt really noticed because when you buy things in most shops VAT is already on the price eg. crisps might cost £1.00 and VAT is 25p so in the shops the crisps would just say £1.25. VAT also affects the cost of petrol and disel - think VAT is about 20% now. I f you go to the airport or on a ferry then products on board or in the terminal do not include VAT so will be cheaper eg. bought headphones at airport for £28, in HMV (music/DVD shop) the same pair were £34.
There are main shops like Tesco, Sainsburys and Asda, each of these sell most things eg. clothes food cleaning products dvds ect. then they have smaller versions like Tesco Extra which only sells food. Most people have prefrences to which one they like best. there are also other shops like morrisons where people also buy food. Not sure what you mean by farmers markets but there are still butches where you can buy meat vegetable shops where you on buy veg - these are a lot more expensive because they are mostly privatly owned rather then a chain.
Transportation. - not sure how much you know.
all around manchester, there are trams and buses. there are two train mains station in the centre. if you purchess a train ticket you can use it on the trams. there are also 3 free metrolink busses that travel around the city centre (at peak time they are every 6mins.) Each bus, tram, train have allocated stops. some buses eg. 192 bus is every 5-10 mins whereas other buses 197 are every 20-30mins. when it isnt peak time (9:30-15:00) buses are less frequent. trains stop running about 23:30 think most buses stop about 4am. after this its taxi or walk. the metrolink bus finishes at 19:00. when travelling by bus, try and get a Stagecoach Magic bus- they are student buses (cheaper) - a day rider for a magic bus is £3.70 where as a dayrider for a ordinary stagecoach bus is £3.90.
Also in in manchester - especially in city centre -  people ignore the traffic lights. cars do follow them but there are lots of one way roads and most people just walk across the road even if the man is on red. i tell you this becaus e the amount of tourists who just stand there and wait for green man when everyone is is crossing is crazy :)
On bringing things over- i think it would come out cheaper just to buy everything from ikea.

true,aww0110,null,null,"The deep American South (which would be Louisiana, East Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama) is still very racist. It's more underground than it was 50 years ago, but it persists. 

You can see its dirty fingers in the differences in employment numbers, poverty statistics, arrests, and prison times. It occasionally crops up in the national news. There are towns that are still known as 'sun-down' towns in which African-Americans will be targeted if they do more than pass through. 

Segregation may no longer be legally enforceable, but it persists anyway through economic means. In spite of attempts to integrate schools, they remain largely segregated by race. This is, in part, because students attend their local (geographic) school, and cities are still largely segregated by race. This leads to a lower quality of education for students in poorer, and largely African-American areas, because schools are funded through local property taxes. Those taxes generate fewer funds for the school, the school gives a lower quality of education as a result, and then those students have trouble finding decent work and stay in the poor part of town. The cycle continues.

When the younger generation tries to be more open and more accepting regarding race, older folks come back with vague biblical references against inter-racial marriage and fraternization and very real numbers regarding crime and poverty disparities in race. 

Most people may realize that saying racial slurs out-loud is wrong, but that doesn't stop them from making 'monkey' jokes about their African-American president, locking their car doors when they see a black man walking down the street, or muttering 'of course' when they see on the news that another drug bust took place in the black part of town.

Perhaps the biggest indicator that race is still an issue is the pride with which people promote the Confederate flag and defend the Confederacy and its ideals. This is still an active conversation for most Southerners, who will insist that slavery was a state's rights issue and that if a state chose to enslave people of color, it was their right to do so under the US constitution. 

And on the subject of the KKK, did you know that Louisiana privatized their school system to allow for private, religious based schooling, enabling them to select their own textbooks? According to the most popular textbooks of those schools, the KKK was a poorly understood public service organization. Those textbooks are very popular with private religious schools, and home-schooled students, in the South.

STEM degrees are not all about gaining technical skills or job prospects. The core of most science degrees is learning to think analytically, problem solve and practice science properly. These are necessary skills required to practice science and proper application of these skills is just as much an artform as anything else.

The reason STEM degrees also attract people who want to further their job prospects is that these skills are also highly desirable in the working world.

EDIT: To make it clear, I would include so-called ""soft sciences"" such as the social sciences as part of the useful set of degrees.

true,Rcp_43b,flair6,,"Ok, here is my take, and prepare for a drawn out, long winded response:  I am a typical american kid in that I played soccer until i was old enough to be pulled out of soccer to play American Football, baseball and the like.  I regret that now, but that is a different story.  I hated Soccer, because I was supposed to, until about the age of 17.  In college my best friends on my dorm floor were soccer players.  I was the loan Ice Hockey player on the floor among a sea of Soccer guys.  My campus job boss was on the team, my RA was on the team, I had no choice; so I assimilated.  I joined their all night FIFA parties, I ABSORBED their knowledge and opinions of EPL, LA Liga, Bundesliga, etc teams all the while curious about where USA stood.  

I was usually met with a ...Meh we should be better, its getting better, but soccer just isnt our sport.  This is all right after 2006 WC.  I knew who Donovan and Dempsey were at this point, but not AWARE of what they meant to US soccer. But my interest was piqued.  I began to watch US soccer whenever I could, I took it upon myself to seek out other Americans.  My best friend had the opinion that Donovan was our best player but he didn't always deserve that title, he loved EPL so he followed Dempsey.  He called it that Dempsey would be the next superstar and really hyped him up to me.  

My limited knowledge agreed, and suddenly, without reason he becaem MY favorite too.  Fast forward a few years, and I am watching EPL off and on, tracking MLSs progress and watching the USMNT **regularly**, blogs, streams, rumors *everything* I can get my hands on, he had turned me into a fanatic.  And through all this, obviously I became a Donovan believer, 2010 was an amazing WC to watch for US fans despite a dissapointing exit at the hands of Ghana, but I also noticed something.  Donovan was Americas golden boy, insanely talented and determined, but Dempsey was *TRULY* American.  He was the kind of player you would almost expect an American to be, at least to my mostly untrained eyes.  He grew up in a poor area, so I have been told (Ireally don't know I guess) on the border of Mexico, perservered on pure talent and brutishness in a sport that just doesn't matter here (usually), in TEXAS of all places.  Then he goes on to set/ match/ or break EPL records yet ESPN and other main sports channels here, barely make a peep.  He really only gets exposure to us when he is in the US uniform. But those who have been following him know he has a legitimate argument for best American to play. Michael Bradley is also up there, and Donovan is Donovan.

**TL:DR** He doesn't get a lot of mainstream exposure here until in a US Jersey, but I believe he is the best to wear the a US Uniform, and I have grown to love the entire sport because of him and Donovan. 

**FOOTNOTE** to address being a Spurs fan, I actually used to choose Tottenham when playing FIFA back then over the other clubs, because I didn't want to be that kid who always used the best teams in the game just to have an advantage since I was new, and I learned the players of the team back when they had Crouch.  So I have always loosely followed them, and when Dempsey joined I decided to just go full Spurs, and join up!

true,[deleted],null,null,"While its nice to debate these things calmly... When people see muslims burning poppies as the troops come home, it enrages people to such levels that groups such as the EDL are formed, or BNP get votes.   It wouldnt be an exaggeration to say it turns people into racists. 

And to say 'well racists are just stupid' and feel superior in that you arent racist, so can take the morale high ground is just a cop-out and inability to see the root issues. 

I strongly believe there is going to be serious trouble in the future in this country. Remember the riots? Looking around I saw that it was mainly black/middle eastern people rioting... And the fact that we have a hell of a lot more white people in Liverpool than ethnic minorities, to me that is worrying.

You can understand the reasons though. Black people and islamist communities are in the poorer areas. So it would make sense they're more angry with society.

I believe we need to integrate these 'ghetto areas' better, control immigration more tightly and creating basic law such as people cant burn poppies or shout abuse to soldiers would help imprison those who are actively trying to incite hatred for our culture. 

Lets face it, you have to be a pretty extreme dick head to shout abuse to one of our soldiers who is returning home from war. 

Imprisoning these people would stop people becoming racist, take those issues off the news and create a more harmonious society, or go towards helping that vision. 

Coming from a fundamental left wing standpoint to this argument and to say 'no its our freedom to critise anything' is stupid because you can still critise. Law could be created specific in its wording to ensure it wouldnt imprison people who are debating the moral consequences of soldiers actions, if they believe what soldiers do is right or not, if they believe the whole war on terror is right or not in its self and what changes can or should be made... It'll simply put an end to hateful actions which arent short off of encitement of treason or to gain support for acts of terror.

People in the liberal arts need the room to take their views to extremes and explore where that takes them. The problem is when there are STEM departments that suddenly are being told the ""new rules"" by the womens' studies department; or the science people being told that what they are doing is evil. 

Quite simply there are too many differences between the arts and the various STEM disciplines that having them under the same roof is just unfair to both. A simple example would be budgets. The study of English just doesn't need a CERN or a space program. Sociology doesn't need access to millions of dollars of medical equipment. Yet you often hear of these arts departments bemoaning the massive budgets of the sciences and whatnot.

But the worst incompatibility is in the basic way of thinking. Sciences are strongly based (oddly enough) on the scientific method. This means that there is little basis between the arts and STEM departments for debate as to how things are done. A simple example would be affirmative action. For the most liberal universities affirmative action is simply not up for debate; they would use some wooly term such as universal right. But if you go to the hardest of hard core technical institutions you will find not a disdain for affirmative action but puzzlement; they think: be smart, study hard, and you get in. Which they would argue is 100% fair. So to give one inch of power over a technical institution by its liberal arts department and it will be destroyed as reputation of its students is paramount.

true,aww0110,null,null,"You make a fair point. The American South is better than it was say 50 years ago, but it is still racist. And I think you are right that their largest problems stem from religious issues, not racial issues. But I think it's a close tie.

Southerners know it's wrong to appear racist and try to hide it, but the largest outrage about racist attitudes comes non-Southerners when national media learns of a story, and then Southerners will get embarrassed and try to fix it. it's a systemic issue that gets a band-aide when the problem comes to the surface. If there was no media attention and subsequent outrage, racism would continue unimpeded by the locals.

For the A BEKA books, I will freely admit that Mother-Jones magazine is a highly biased source. But it isn't the only source that has reported on the textbook issues (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/08/crazy-facts-students-will_n_1758003.html). To be fair, because of national attention, it is possible that those books, and possibly the voucher program itself, will be up for debate in state politics and reformed (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/us/louisiana-voucher-programs-financing-is-ruled-unconstitutional.html).

Can I cite an article that shows how strongly attached people are to the idea of the Confederacy? Probably not a conclusive one. 

It is a common myth that a state's right to slavery was the purpose behind the Civil War, so much so that I did find an article debunking the theory (http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths-about-why-the-south-seceded/2011/01/03/ABHr6jD_story.html).

I can show you that South Carolina, not even a Deep South state, but still a Southern one, that continues to fly the Confederate flag (http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57359819-503544/confederate-flag-flap-could-impact-mlk-day-debate/) and point to articles about the continued obsession with the Confederate flag (http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/08/americas-simple-minded-obsession-with-the-confederate-flag/261236/).

Lastly, I will point out that the South has had such a huge problem with disenfranchising minorities that the majority of Southern states still have federal oversight on their redistricting processes, to keep them from gerrymandering away minorities into all-white voting districts and diluting their votes (http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/covered.php). These rules have come to national attention because of Texas succeeding in gerrymandering its few liberal counties into larger, conservative ones, but these rules were put into place because of disenfranchisement based on racial bias (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act). The act recently passed renewal, and while some counties originally covered have opted out, most of the Southern states that were subjected to its scrutiny haven't been passed the opt-out requirements.",0,1355458412,null,0,false,0,c7gby0a,t3_14s4g5,t1_c7gby0a,t1_c7ga881,null,1430669407,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Besides instinctive scoring, his physical size is definitely one of his best attributes. I mean, just *look* at him...he's big enough to be an NFL running back.

Plus, the level of pay cut it would take to realign his wages with his place in the squad is too much; he's probably worth 60k/wk at best, and he can get that wage from other clubs that will also play him more often than we will, so he may as well go elsewhere.",0,1355463300,null,0,false,0,c7gd61r,t3_14smqs,t1_c7gd61r,t1_c7g144m,null,1430669967,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

That goal was just magical, because it made people care and rewarded a lot of fans, both hardcore and casual, who had been waiting for something.People remember that goal, but I remember Dempsey leading the rest of the team by working his ass off trying to set up the team or get the ball in the net himself somehow. Personally I have had a Team USA shirt for a long time, and am getting the new USA jersey of his. I watch every team USA game I can even though we aren't that good, and I always said I would become a fan of whatever (hopefully) larger scale team he joined, because It was pretty hard to ever see a match with him playing at Fulham, and I didn't want to switch teams after trying to learn some history about them.

I always felt that way about people that followed the likes of Man U, Real Madrid, and such. One of my best friends is an Arsenal fan, and we began watching games thogether during their unbeaten run. Well I figured its easy to be an arsenal fan when they keep winning, Man U just buys up players, so I asked him who their biggest rival was. When he said Spurs, I decided to reaserch them and get knowledgable, and they had everything I love about a sports team. A rich history, a bitter rivalry, a style associated with them, and more importantly, they had potential without it being a given.

true,AnAlliterationAside,null,null,"I should probably start out by saying that I've always loved soccer and am currently in my mid twenties. Unfortunately, during my teen years soccer was never really shown here in the States and thus my knowledge of the professional leagues was extremely limited.  Here I'd only heard of D.C. United and Galaxy when Beckham arrived and over seas I'd heard of big clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Manchester United. A few years ago my satellite provider experimented with some new channels that showed sports like Rugby, Gaelic Football, and Soccer.  I began watching them all in earnest until such time as the satellite provider wanted a steep fee that I wasn't willing to pay. During this time I had seen a Manchester Derby and being the kind of person I am, I rooted for City because I don't like jumping on the bandwagon of a popular team. I don't remember what year it was, though I remember seeing Tevez playing for United. A simple Google search could solve that question, but it really isn't relative. I picked city as my team only because I hadn't really heard of any of the others and at this time I didn't even understand the league system of promotion and relegation. All I knew was City was winning 1-0 and faced down a United offensive onslaught over and over again.

So that's how it went for some time, I rooted for City but didn't really know much about them until I stumbled upon FSC (Fox Soccer Channel) and finally had a station that actually showed games on a consistent schedule instead of scattered showings here and there. 

I started becoming disillusioned with City as I saw them as becoming akin to the New York Yankees in MLB (Major League Baseball) and just using the seemingly limitless funds of their owner to raid other teams for the best players and buying wins. It's part of any professional sport I realize, but I found it annoying and while I wasn't on the lookout for a new team I was certainly not as supportive of City as I once was and started watching different teams. Previously I had only watched games that City were involved in due to limited free time.

Now for the game I saw that made me a Spurs fan. I watched Spurs play in the Champions League because I was bored one day and like I said, I was branching out. The game was the first leg in the group stages vs Inter Milan. Gomes was sent off and the Spurs were down by four. I figured it was going to be a rout and was looking forward to seeing a bunch of goals. What amazed me though, and this was before Bale's Hat Trick, was that despite watching the hell get beaten out of their team, the Tottenham fans were still singing and having a grand old time just being there. They were still showing their support for the team they loved despite everything that was happening on the field. I was struck by this, fascinated even. I couldn't understand it. Over here if this had happened in Hockey or Football people would be booing, leaving early, the works. I watched the rest of the game hoping that Tottenham would at least get some consolation. Turns out they were consoled three times, as the game ended 4-3 to Inter, but that statement was made that Spurs were a team on the rise with a loving fan base, and I wanted to be a part of that. 

That is how I became a Spurs fan.",0,1355466696,null,0,false,0,c7gdv6h,t3_14twfn,t1_c7gdv6h,t3_14twfn,null,1430670298,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Well, this should be fun.

&gt; “We did 26 deals and to think we wouldn’t make any mistakes in such a huge number of deals in and out would be totally unrealistic.""

That's a hugely misleading way to put it - it's generally far easier to evaluate whether/when to sell a player than it is on bringing one in, (especially when you consider some of the players we moved on) so lumping both transfers in and transfers out together makes their success rate look better than it actually was. 

As he says himself, they didn't make any mistakes on players going out. (some will say Meireles shouldn't have left, or that Aquilani should have been given a chance, but by switching to 4-4-2 under Kenny, neither of those were going to be first XI players anymore, so financially it made sense to move them both on; remember Meireles wanted a new contract as promised to him by H&amp;G). So all the questions are about the players brought in.

&gt; I am very uncomfortable for players to be judged after six, eight or even 12 months. Sometimes it takes two or three years.

&gt; We signed fantastic young players, the owners said it was exactly what they wanted, but I kept saying it was a five-year plan.

This is the continual source of confusion about the mandate given to Kenny &amp; Comolli - were they told by FSG to get back into the top 4 ASAP, embark on a long-term project with young players, or both at the same time? If it was both, that's highly unrealistic from FSG and I have sympathy for Kenny &amp; Comolli - although they should have both been clear with FSG that it was difficult to succeed in that manner. But it seems that Dalglish was judged by FSG using the former benchmark, while he and Comolli embarked on the latter - something was lost in communication somewhere, and that doesn't reflect well on the way the club was functioning.

&gt; “The way we looked at it, we were selling two players – Fernando Torres and Ryan Babel – and we were bringing two in – Suarez and Carroll – and we were making a profit and the wage bill was coming down considerably as well. It was a four-player deal.

&gt; They [FSG] asked me what the risks were and I said if things don’t go well you’ll lose something on Andy, but it is difficult to measure whether you will make money if things go well because Liverpool aren’t a selling club and he could be here for the next 10 years.”

Fuck me that's simplistic and naive - if Suarez left in January for 50m, would Comolli see fit to bring in Sturridge for 30m? I'm not going to go into his evaluation of the risk/reward because it's just bewildering.

&gt; “They weren’t happy about the fact we were not scoring enough goals. They thought we were not playing enough positive football.

So our owners still don't know much about the game; for the most part, even during the damned second half of the season, we were playing positive football, some of the most positive football in the league.

Finally, this article doesn't even mention one of the biggest criticisms with Comolli's deals - he overpayed both in transfer fees *and* wages, the latter making it highly difficult for us to move players on in the same way it had been difficult for him to move Cole and Aquilani on.

Considering it's run by a small number of volunteers who hold other full time commitments and pay their member dues as well, we can't put as much time into organising things as we'd like to.

Also we're in the enviable position of being one of the few tech-groups in Belfast who haven't got mountains of cash from InvestNI etc. (no investment opportunity in a charity), and since we make no distinction about our programmes, we don't fit into the classic 'Cross Community Fund' boxes, so we can't contract out any work or administration as every penny that goes in, goes towards paying rent, gas, electric, etc.So a massive amount of that volunteer time that could go on event planning goes to putting out financial fires and keeping the doors open.

A big aspect that you''re missing is that it's a really good hot-desking environment near the city centre with solid wi-fi, half decent desks, and bearable coffee.

Who would buy from the average street dealer when it's available in regulated outlets?

Also feminised seeds and cloning.

The only reason indoor lighting is done is because people are trying to hide the weed. if you can grow enough because it doesnt matter if anyone finds it, then you can sell it for less.

Its not going to get ridiculously cheap because this goes by what I call ""weed is pretty similar to alcohol"" economics.

Say it takes a half bottle of spirits to get you wasted, people will pay around £6-8 for that bottle.

The most it would take even a daily user to get stoned of their tits would be an 1/8, so therefore the cost would be similar to that of a half bottle of spirits, around £6-8 or maybe £10.

There certainly is an issue of it becoming legal then being overtaxed and people going back to the black market like they do with fags and spirits.  But let's get over one hurdle at a time.

It does seem there was some confusion with regards to how long they had at the club, but no matter what you are told your goal is, when given over £100million to spend on players, the owners will expect to finish in the champions league places, or at least higher than *8th*.

There's nothing wrong with buying young players for a long term plan but the only decent young player we got was Henderson, and we vastly overpaid on him. Look at the young player Chelsea bought, Oscar &amp; Hazard. They were bought for the future but are still extremely effective today. Im not saying we should have bought those two, but players of a similar ilk.

&gt; Having said all that, Comolli was still effective in some ways - in moving players on, in broadening our scouting network, and in signing academy players. Time will tell if the new recruitment team can make up for his absence in these areas.

11 percent of the country is *liberal*. That is, they don't vote for the LibDems because they feel labour has let them down or the tories are mad, they vote for the LibDems because of an ideological identification with the party. The only issue with these guys is turnout, hence why the LibDems have such a strong eve of poll and on polling day knock up. 
The Lib Dems need at least 23 per cent of the vote to further their position. This has previously been built up by the acquisition of protest votes from former labour voters. No longer. This is where the 'they're finished' argument comes from. 


However, across the country, libdem candidates have been taking tory safe seats, smashing tory marginals and even gaining a presence in tory / labour marginals. 

The point is that they, if they play their cards right, can boost their relevance to liberal voters, maximising turnout while at the same time taking votes from tories who want to see a centre right party that isn't beholden to nut cases like Dorries or Bone. 

Just from a campaign perspective, the Lib Dems aren't doing to bad at the moment. What happens after the next election, however, will define the party going forward.

But the evidence on legalisation/medicalisation/regulation of hard drugs is that:-

* It doesn't lead to more experimentation
* It leads to a reduction in problematic use
* It leads to less morbidity and mortality amongst problematic users
* It leads to less concurrent problems from problematic use (less crime, less social breakdown, less unemployment, etc.)

It's obviously horrible to have lost someone to drugs, but there's no easy way to say that your girlfriend might still have been alive had she been a heroin user under a system of regulated medicalised legalised drug policy.  The survival rates and health of dependant users under some other more liberal systems than ours are far superior.

that's not my argument, at no point did I say not to wear a helmet, or a seatbelt. Interestingly though, half of all car related deaths are because of head trauma, I say we stick helmets on drivers. Could save upto a 1000 lives each year.

I cant agree with that - most cycle lanes kinda encourage going up the inside (as they are on the left side).Most average people see an empty cycle lane and assume that its fine to go up, they have no idea that a truck has blind spots - and why should thay, why would they assume that you can drive a 10 ton truck without the driver knowing his surrounding..

With the 11th Doctor, we see a more child-like manifestation as if he were a school boy.  It's as if in his regeneration that he chose not to be god like as the 10th Doctor did - he's essentially grown out of that and up but instead of acting like an old man, he becomes more cheerful and playful and as I've noticed, more of a schemer with his lying as he figures out how to do his homework.  So, he does remember his past, he just chooses not to go down that path again.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"I will slit my own wrists if we get him. 

We are building a line up with some of the most creative and versatile players in the league and to add a one trick donkey who can only run on a vertical and horizontal axis is going to be completely against that idea, even as a sub. Heck I want Sturridge in the line up more than I want Walcott, I know what he is doing and has done for Arsenal because I watch all of their games because I'm expecting them to lose all the time. Don't go on the stats or what Arsenal fans say, Walcott is one of the most overrated players in the league and one of the last names I'd ever want at Chelsea. I would even take back Kalou before we got this guy.

Here is our midfield and those who are playing close by:

Mata : Can play RAM, LAM, CAM, CM. Visionary, touch of an angel, creativity of gods and decision making pretty much second to none in our team. Scores goals, provides assists, can play deep, gorgeous specimen of a human being all round. 

Hazard : LAM, RAM, FW, CAM. Beats players just for the lulz. Presents chances that anyone bar Gervinho can finish. Great first touch. Full of ambition and self confidence and puts his money where his mouth is. 

Oscar : CM, CAM, LAM. Another Brazilian beauty. Boys got more talent in his left toe than Walcott's entire career. Consistent, strong and proving the doubters wrong on a day to day basis. Shows up on the biggest of matches and these kind of players are what win you trophies.

Victor Moses : RM, RAM, LM. Guy can play on both wings and is filling up for the physical presence we are lacking. When he comes on I'm always happy because we start winning more of the 50/50's after he is on. The Victor flicks ^TM at the edge of the box always give me a footie boner when he knocks defenders over just by changing direction and pace without even touching them. 

Then we still have Ramires, Mikel, Romeu, Bertrand, Marin, Piazon, Sturridge all of who I will prefer over this next fucktard. 

THEO FUCKING WALCOTT : Shit player, shit team, one trick pony. Can only run horizontal or vertical. Tries to beat players with pace which isn't even that good of an ability when you come against a CB who is not in his 30's. His best run of play comes when two or three defenders infront of him confuse themselves by thinking the other guy is marking this guy because clearly they don't want to bother wasting their time at which point one of them makes a mistake and falls over while Walcott turns into Messi and runs past invisible players. Can only play RAM. Horrible passing, pukable decision making, absurd first touch. Cannot hold the ball, cannot hold up play, not physically strong, not good in the air, cannot bring down goal keeper balls. How this kid is a professional footballer  I'll never know. I have always thought of him as a joke to be playing in a top 4 club but now he is at the right place since Arsenal wont be top 4. Cant cross to save his life. Once in a while gets 3 good games in a row at which point Arsenal fans compare him to Messi and the pros and cons of trading him with Messi, after which he starts playing like Walcott who rarely shows up and is one of the most inconsistent players in the league. Geezer doesn't know what he is going to get out of this kid hence he makes more appearances as a sub than as a starter. Either he plays half a decent match or most of the time doesn't even bother turning up and sinks his team with him by playing catch the ball with the fans at the top stands.

He will only down grade our squad even as a sub. It will stop the ideology we are building up of having such a talented and versatile squad by putting this idiot in it. I thought this post would be a joke but I just cannot comprehend how horrible of a decision this will be if it happens which let me tell you, it never will and for good reason.",0,1355488019,null,0,1355488680,0,c7ggevb,t3_14u89u,t1_c7ggevb,t3_14u89u,null,1430671510,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

Think about it. What got fixed in time there? Amy left the Doctor. For every single other companion (in NuWho, anyways), the Doctor is the Most Important Person in the universe. Rose and Martha fell in love with him. He showed Donna the whole universe.

But then Amy came along. At the very beginning, the Doctor was the most important person to Amy. But then Rory came into the picture. Over the course of series 5-7, it becomes more and more obvious that Rory is Amy's Most Important Person. But as long as Rory is with the Doctor, he can pretend that he's still Amy's favourite.

So now we come to TATM. The Doctor is finally faced by the truth: he's not the most important person in Amy's life. So when he's saying that this moment can't be rewritten, he's referring to that moment. In the cemetery. When Amy makes the obvious choice of Rory over the Doctor.

How can the Doctor react? He can't possibly go back to get Amy. I'm sure he *could* if he wanted to, rules of time be damned. But he can't, because to do so would be to acknowledge that the Doctor Just Isn't Enough. And that's something the Doctor can never admit to himself.

Rule 1: The Doctor lies. He said he can't go back to New York because of a Time Vortex or Paradox or whatever. But that's not the truth.

The doctor says numerous times in his first few regenerations that he's thousands of years old. Now he says he's only 900, but there may be reasons for this.

First: the wibbly wobbly reason. Time doesn't flow the same in all areas. Depending on the gravity of the scenario (puns...), time flows faster or slower. Also, time could be perceived differently by time lords. We have no idea if the doctor even sees time linearly as we do, or even if his linear perception functions the same. Time to a time lord may be a vagary of perception.

Secondly: a year to whom? If a year is defined the same on galifrey as it is on earth, then it would be the time it takes galifrey to circle its star. Are we talking galifreyan years, or earth years?

First off, even if he's not physically 2000 years old, he still has 2000 years worth of memories,. Switch or no switch, he has to be getting some advantage from those memories. For instance, Rory the Roman was trained to fight, most likely with spear and shield. Human Rory, even if he lacked the muscle (plastic?) memory of his alternate self, could still pick up a spear and kick some ass by sheer virtue of the training he can recall.

Theoretically, let's say that he spent two centuries in the Library of Alexandria before it was destroyed, just reading. I know, he was guarding the Pandorica, but I'd get bored after the first few decades. We'll assume he brought it with him. Without the need to sleep or eat, he can get a lot more reading done than the average bear. A human with a lifespan of 80 years, sleeping 7 hours a night and barely leaving the books, could spend about 53 years absorbing knowledge. Rory the Roman, in roughly two and a half (modern) human lifespans, could absorb four lifetime's worth of knowledge.

Now that Rory the Roman is all caught up on the latest and greatest advances in mathematics and science, he can pair this up with knowledge he has from Human Rory (the one that got eaten by the crack). It would take a while for him to reproduce modern science, but he has all the time in the world. He'd probably finish this work many centuries early and then be able to go on to make drastic improvements to modern science.

Now, as Human Rory.2, he has all of this theoretical knowledge to call upon. He's still probably not as knowledgeable as the Doctor in many areas but its reasonable to assume that he might surpass him in some.",0,1355490552,null,0,false,0,c7ggpvi,t3_14tvyr,t1_c7ggpvi,t1_c7gepkx,null,1430671649,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

Film is normally shot at 24fps.  With a film projector there's a natural transition between frames as there's a shutter, and this works with CRTs too as there's a slight fade between frames.  It's not really noticable but it helps your brain glue frames together and so you perceive seamless, smooth motion.

With modern TVs and digital projection the low frame rate shows.  Panning shots seem to judder, and I found the frame rate really noticeable when watching Skyfall recently.

Modern tvs put quite a lot of effort into being able to show movies well, and it doesn't quite work because your telly is running at 50 or 60hz, maybe even up to 120, and 24 fps doesn't neatly fit into that.

If film was shot in 120 fps and shown at 120fps then it'd look fantastic  and should be a high enough frame rate not to need improvement given the limitation of the human eye.

24fps was the lowest they could get away with nearly 100 years ago because film was expensive.

It's just a shame they work at Waterstone's - they'd be much better suited to a smaller indie. bookstore.

It's like comic books - I'd rather buy from Amazon than Forbidden Planet, but I'll buy the hell out of some comics from a smaller store where the staff take the time to point out cool items. Last one I went into there was a super small little reading area - the manager let me take an armful of comics over and read 'em before deciding if I was going to buy them.

Winded up buying all of Scott Pilgrim, all of Transmetropolitan, some Superman stand alones and a few other titles.

&gt;I'm certainly not content with letting Amazon hold my purchased books to ransom with their 'licensing, not selling' and 'reserving the right to withdraw at any time' T&amp;C horseshit. Steam makes me paranoid enough.

If however you're undertaking between curb and lorry then 100% you're an idiot. Only one person is going to die in that scenario and it isn't the lorry driver.

the problem is left turning hgvs do so even when there is a cycle lane in place - that's my point - you can be happily cycling up the side of traffic and come into danger. Of course if you try to squeeze down the side of any vehicle then your a numpty, but that's not what I'm saying.

Some countries have installed two sets of lights - one for cyclists and one for cars. This has resulted in saving lives as it allows cyclists to move outside the blind spots and past/in front of traffic. 

&gt;As I say all of this has nothing to do with wearing a helmet, you don't want to wear one, knock yourself out. Probably literally.

I wear a helmet thanks, I encourage people to wear one. I never said I was anti helmet. As for having nothing todo with each other...not doing one and wearing the other will save lives...

British should accept immigrant culture just as immigrants should accept British culture (full disclosure: I am 2nd generation British Chinese and I love living in this country, no matter how much people complain about the weather :) ).

Threatening language, abusive racism, libel with intent to harm ones reputation, incitement to violence, these are all things that I agree should remain illegal and should carry consequences. However, if someone says or does something which does not physically harm or meet one of the above criteria, then I think it should be perfectly legal. There will always be assholes in this world and provided they aren't causing any real harm, they should be ignored. We all know that the only way to not feed the troll is to ignore them.

In the case of the people burning poppies, if they are threatening the soldiers, or shouting racism or yelling, ""kill the soldiers"", then for sure they should be arrested. But if they are yelling something merely insulting from an arbitrary point of view, then in my book, it does not merit prison.

*The next bit is a bit off topic but I don't really understand your making a connection between the riots, racists and immigration. As a child of immigrants and friend to many hard working immigrants, I feel the need to present counter argument against attempts to blame immigrants for our problems.*

In Liverpool, you say there are more white people, but the riots were mostly minorities. Assuming this is actually true (I don't have the numbers), all this suggests is that the white people are generally more affluent and therefore have no interst in rioting. Many, **not all**, members of the minorities, **along with many poor white folks** were angry at the state of our economy and the lack of opportunities for themselves to rise out of poverty. This led to the riots and the panic lent opportunity to looting. If there were any racial tensions, I would have expected there to have been violence between the white rioters and the minorities or something. As far as I know, none were reported. I believe most of the criminals were looting their local area, so there was no targeting of white owned businesses by minorities or vice versa.

Furthermore, there is no basis for blaming social unrest on ""the immigrants"" because there has been no suggestion that a large part of the criminals were non-British. Not being white doesn't make you an immigrant (I am taking immigrant to mean non-British here, you may disagree). Neither are all immigrants non-white. If you have statistics that suggest otherwise, please share them.

It is also misleading to suggest that reducing immigration would reduce the number of poor minorities.

Let us consider the people who sneak into the UK via illegal means, or those overstaying there visas. They obviously should and would be removed by the Border Agency. Let us assume for a moment that the Border Agency is *not* completely and utterly incompetent and haven't left huge communities or ""ghettos"" of illegal immigrants just milling about the UK's biggest cities. From this we must assume that the vast majority of these people are here legally. Even before the current government started restricting immigration, it was already very hard for people from outside the EU to get into the UK (or stay in the UK once their visa is expiring). Believe me, I know many who try.

To be a student, you have prove that you have massive reserves of funds to allow you to pay your way through university with overseas fees (which are usually over £15,000 per year), then you leave when you're done. To work in the UK, you have to have a company willing to sponsor you and pay you a salary of at least £20,000. Obviously these people wouldn't be in the poor minority. Not to mention that they bring in millions in income to the UK and taxes to the government.

If they're not working and they're still legally in the country, then they must already have citizenship or residency. To get this they must have immigrated to the UK a very long time ago. It is really very difficult and takes a very long time to get either of these nowadays - Five continuous years in the UK under full employment/sponsorship to get residency and a further 5 years once you get that to become British.

Therefore, it is a misconception (championed by groups like EDL and BNP and idiots like Theresa May) that immigrants are the cause of our current economic and social problems. The vast majority of the people coming to the UK are here to work hard, pay their taxes and contribute to the economy and society. But they are an easy target for politicians to blame for all the country's problems because they are outsiders and they can't vote. That's why Theresa May is unwilling to provide any statistics about how many immigrants are actually overstaying their visa or working illegally or claiming benefits. She and the conservatives will just keep whining about immigration being ""out of control"" and how it needs to be reduced, with no real analysis of the benefits that immigrants bring to this country.

Lets have a look at a few.:

Oldham East and Saddleworth - 5% swing from Liberal to Labour.

Leicester South - 8.4% swing from Lib Dem to Labour.

Corby - 9% drop in Lib Dem vote share.

And I could go on. The last one I quoted is, to my mind, especially damming with regards to your theory. If, as you say, the Liberals were pulling support in from disgruntled tories, then one might reasonably expect the Lib dem vote to hold up quite well. Left leaning liberals would defect to labour, centre right tories would defect to the lib dems.

Instead, the tories held onto their centre right contingent whilst being dumped in droves by floating voters who all seemed to go over to labour. The more, shall we say, Daily Mail minded element of the conservative party seem to have jumped into bed with Ukip, and the lib dem vote just collapsed.

Of course, I don't really place that much stock in parliamentary by elections either. Any kind of by election has the potential to throw up an odd result.

And I don't really blame blame Clegg for the Lib Dems prediciment either. The lib dems always knew that their only realistic shot at any form of power was a coalition of some sort following hung parliament, and they always knew, although never publicly admitted, that any such coalition would probably cost them the support of a third to a half of their voters.

There are no statistics that give us any information on that whatsoever. All that can be concluded from the data is that Wales is becoming more irreligious. In any case, if you do not already, you should understand that Dawkins is an agnostic atheist himself.

&gt;*I believe the real answer is that people have enough material wealth not to feel the need to ask for some divine assistance just to get by, i.e. there's a correlation between material wealth and ""spiritual inclination"".*

That's something which can be refuted quite easily if you look at the data. Within Wales, it is often the poorer local authorities that are the more irreligious.

In North Wales the picture's even more confused. Gwynedd - pretty much middle of the road in terms of GVA per capita - is the most irreligious at 29.7%.

No it doesn't or anything of the sort. It works similar to Quidco and Topcashback in so much that you pass on a percentage of the commission you get from the online retailers. It can take months to get your money back and like Quidco and Topcashback not all such transactions are successful. 

Stop fucking lying. You cannot guarantee they get all their money back or anything of the like. They will only get all their money back if the commission after your deductions matches or exceeds their purchase price and they're lucky enough to get picked out the hat. If I buy a £1000 TV from Amazon, I won't get £1000 back and to insinuate I can is an outright lie.

The way you are promoting your website is completely and utterly irresponsible. If people aren't very careful and read how it actually works or understand how it works they could possibly spend £100's they don't have and would only be spending because they think they will get it all back.

I really don't know why I'm bothering, but here's a few facts for you:

The only other large nation that uses AV is Austraila. Guess how many hung parliaments they've had since the second world war? One. Less than us, under two party FPP. 

Every study I have seen suggested that AV would have increased the majority of the ruling party at all but one election for the last twenty five years. And even in 92, the tories would still have won, just with a slightly smaller majority.

Hung parliaments are more likely under FPP than they are under AV. Every shred of evidence supports this.

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8506306.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8506306.stm)

The problem with FPP is that there's no point voting for small parties, who only have less than five percent of the vote in a given constituency, because they will never win any representation. AV does absolutely nothing to fix this.

AV was in NO WAY an improvement over FPP. It might have meant there were eighty swing constituencies rather than fifty, and it might have meant that parties winning landslides would win even bigger landslides, but that's it.

Because of Jan, Lombaerts and Alderweireld's versatility and training they can do something that Vermaelen seems less able to do which is move outside. Maximizes the talent you have on the field.

Also makes me really appreciate Jan even more, an unbelievably talented CB who moves into other slots because it benefits the team not him personally.  Class player, class act.

**FOOTNOTE** to address being a Spurs fan, I actually used to choose Tottenham when playing FIFA back then (2006) over the other clubs, because I didn't want to be that kid who always used the best teams in the game just to have an advantage since I was new, and I learned the players of the team back when they had Crouch. So I have always loosely followed them, and when Dempsey joined I decided to just go full Spurs, and join up!

He was exhumed on the 27th November to test. It will be interesting to see the results and if he was killed this way it might open this back up again.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"I don't mean this to be insulting but I think a lot of Arsenal fans (I'd suggest newer ones, that don't remember the winning years) have managed to convince themselves that having the (slightly flimsy) moral high ground (Henry, Petit, Bergkamp, Overmars, Ljungberg, Viera, et al. were hardly academy products) is somehow prefereable to success.  I think some of them really believe that they're happier to have owners intent on bleeding fans dry for their own personal gain than they are having an owner that is looking for success and is prepared to make a personal loss to make it happen.

Personally, I've been a fan since before I can remember - I'm told my first match was a snoozefest against Luton Town.  Ithink all the problems that we currently have are about certain parts of the support, but I'd expect these problems plague Arsenal too - I'm thinking specifically about... special interest groups... okay what I mean is people that will say they're City fans but really are just totally into *one* of our players.  Any time their player doesn't make the starting 11 they flood any available outlet to share their disgust at the direction of the team and insist that Mancini must go.  The other problem group (and maybe these guys have the right attitude and I'm just stuck in the past) is the newly entitled - I don't think we have too many of them yet, but these are people that seem to have discarded all recent history and use last season as their only frame of reference.  Yeah, I get that we should be looking to move forward and it's probably more helpful to be thinking about whether Javi Garcia is an improvement over Nigel De Jong than it is when I think about who looks most like a lesbian out of Samir Nasri and Garry Flitcroft, but I just think a bit of perspective and gratefulness is probably a good thing.

I've said this before in footyroom.com-- People only hate City because they're jealous. It's bullshit for them to say that they'd rather win the league without being bought by a rich owner who will pump cash into your team. The reality is that you won't make it to the top without money. United has been able to stay up for so long because they spend big $ as well, United fans are ignorant if they think we're the only Manchester team to do it. 

Arsenal was able to stay 3rd last season because they had a certain world class player who carried you there. What do you do? Sell him although he wanted to stay. That whole letter scandal, I do believe he did it because he wanted to pressure Wenger into bringing in big players. What happens? Wenger's ego tells him to fuck off and sells him to United and replace him with Podolski and Giroud. Arsenal needs to spend money on world class players and soon. 

Sure your youth is great, but those are long-term results and what's the use if you're going to sell them? Would be sad if Arsenal ended up going Liverpool's way.

Ok but seriously now, I was in line for scholarships with numerous schools to play D1 soccer coming out of high school (United States) and a large part of my confidence and ability to perform came from regular sessions with a sports psychologist.  I've never had much in the way of self confidence in general but after some meetings I developed an unbreakable faith in my ability which really paid big dividends.  Its really hard to explain how or why it made a difference, I guess the psychologist was able to help me change the way I see myself relative to other people on the pitch and help me remove the fear of making a mistake, playing poorly, letting the team down, etc.  Playing a clear and trouble free mind in which you know that you are able to win the next ball, beat the next defender, nail that defense splitting pass, or finish the next chance, really makes a huge difference.

The first version we played was the first one, 92/93 season Norwegian edition, which was the first game to contain real players. I was younger than my brother and cousins, so I was the last one to choose team. They always choose the ""good"" teams, so when I asked for a good team (I was young, ~6, didn't have a clue), they said Tottenham was decent. 

The biggest advantage with being Tottenham, was that they had the biggest talent in the game. A young lad, only 18 y/o, but already as good as some of the best central defenders in the league, he is later known as Judas. For those who don't know, CM is all about buying and selling players, and of course my young lad was the hottest buying object in the league. So I had this young lad every one else wanted, and it gave me a huge power feeling. I could deny my older brother and cousins something they wanted, I hadn't experienced so much power in my life at that point, and it was wonderful.

He made one mistake - he seriously misjudged what was expected of him by the electorate.

One of the biggest criticisms of the Lib Dems is that they have the policies for opposition and have neither the nous nor the ability to take the tough decisions when confronted with real problems and real budgetary constraints.

When student funding was plunged into crisis, there were a few options on the table and all involved raising fees, with most involving rises that students had to pay immediately.

Nick was keen to show you were wrong about the Lib Dems, and that when faced with a series of terrible options they would fight for and own the most palatable.

BIG MISTAKE. He was immediately slammed for breaking his election promises, accused of trading his beliefs for a ministerial car, and his reputation has never recovered.

When I started following City they weren't immensely successful, but since then they've only gotten better, and so I sometimes get incredulous over things that at the end of the day aren't all that important. 

One instance that made me realize this was when I made a comment on /r/soccer over the summer about the pro's and cons of Eden Dzeko as a striker, and I got downvoted to oblivion. At first I was like, well it's just /r/soccer, they're always like this, but it later occurred to me that they were kind of right. My basic argument against dzeko was that he wasn't as incredilbe as RVp, so if we had to sell someone to make way for van Persie, it should be Dzeko, but it occurred to me that Dzeko is stll fantastic by most standards, and that we were lucky to have him, and I was basically bitching about how my mercedes wasn't the newest model.  

So I sort of reexamined my attitude, and decided that there was no reason for me to be this ambitious with my expectations for city, when after all we already had a league winning side.

I try not to be ambitious like this, but every now and again I have to remind myself that it's not the end of the world for me as a fan if we don't win the league again. The fact that we are even in contention is nice.

Here's why I think you're wrong.

The reality electoral reform is that rarely happens. Compare the frequency of voting reforms with the frequency of NHS reforms.

Why? Simple. Any politician in power today was put there under the current voting system. Why would they want to change a system that handed them power for one that's likely to result in power sharing?

Therefore, dramatic electoral reform is only likely to happen in a situation where no one party has overall power. This is self evidently true. People like me have been banging on about PR for decades, but it took a hung parliament and a coalition government to actually get genuine electoral reform on the table.

I believe that *only* a hung parliament or a coalition government are ever likely to bring about electoral reform. And as we established up thread, such situations are less likely to happen under AV.

&gt;I sign on with people who speak under their voices like 'arr lad be arsed bein ere tho laa, feel fucked up from las nyt lad was on a mad one on the lil fellas an dat hahaha'

And? What right do you have to judge anyone, lest of all people who, on a very basic level, are in the same situation as yourself - namely unemployed and in receipt of welfare. Least of all because by your own admission:

&gt;I had to resign from my previous job...

You're in this position through your own actions?

&gt;However, I can't even log into my job search. If they send your username they send the first half, and tell you the second half on the website. But it doesn't work.. so I should make a new email and sign up all over again.

Universal Jobmatch doesn't work like that. To be fair it doesn't work at all half of the time, but the sign-up process is all online - you use your email address to sign-up; the system generates a Government Gateway I.D comprising twelve characters.

&gt;If they start saying 'go an work in tesco lad for experience', I'll just tell them straight up my previous experience is a hell of a lot more valuable than stacking shelves and I wont even put that on my CV because it makes me out to be even more a knob head.

You're in receipt of welfare. If the JCP tell you to apply for a job, what right do you think you have to not apply for it? I have a degree, multiple qualifications etc. etc, but if I were to find myself unemployed, and told that I had to apply for a position in Poundland? As much as it would annoy me, I'd damn well apply for it - if only to keep the JCP off my back, whilst looking for more ""appropriate"" vacancies.

And if as a consequence of said interview I got a job at Poundland? I'd take it, with the aim of getting out of there as quickly as possible.

&gt;And I know you're going to say 'BUT ITS A LIFELINE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STUPID', which I agree.. but honestly, for me, as a dole head, I just feel like a knob head begging for a jiro.

It's not a lifeline for people who are idiots. It - JSA - is a payment given out to people who aren't able to support themselves, due to not having any income [well, IB JSA is].",0,1355509617,null,0,false,0,c7gl5s7,t3_14ue1v,t1_c7gl5s7,t1_c7gkmr7,null,1430673833,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

The argument was (is) not really about developing players versus spending money, even a cursory glance at Arsenal squads through the ages would reveal that argument to be utterly void (I bet you didn't even take two seconds to think of those names).  The *real* argument is the *manner* through which the financial investment came.  Internal versus External.

Arsenal have always been one of the biggest spenders in English football (and they've also always had some of the highest ticket prices) but, and I'm not saying Arsenal are financial paragons, it has on the whole always been self-financed post-WW2.

Chelsea on the other hand went on a big debt financed spending spree in the late 90's and early 00's that left them on the verge of bankruptcy.  Now, I'm not one to say all debt is bad but I'm pretty sure if that debt puts you on the verge of bankruptcy it's probably not been a well thought out financial move.  At any rate a certain Russian saved the club from disaster and then proceeded to pump a ludicrous amount of cash into the club.  *Chelsea FC* would never in a million years have been able to self-finance this spending.

If Chelsea FC made a profit of £500 million every year and spent it all on transfers every year *I wouldn't have any complaints* (Assuming no dodgy deals were going on, naturally ;)).

Unfortunately due to the big online presence of Arsenal fans and the lack of clarity expressed by the majority of football fans and combined with Arsenal's change of direction at about the same time to buying younger players for cheaper fees/wages this became a cry of 'spending is evil, we develop and are therefore better'.  And yes, this is more apparent in the newer fans, especially those from across the Atlantic who seem to pick a club and then instantly dive into parroting whatever it is they see other fans saying.

For me a victory achieved more or less solely on the whim of external funding would be enjoyable (who doesn't like good football?) but hollow.  The victory of the guy who plays fair over the cheat is far more meaningful, no?

After a call (and half an hour of waiting for someone to answer) we were told that it should be up by the next morning. It wasn't. 

A whole *week* later it turned out that there's a connection problem somewhere in our area and they sent a guy to take a look. He was supposedly fixing it right now. 

A **month** later, still no internet, we kept calling them twice a week to check the progress and kept getting the same answer, ""We're working on it, really sorry, it should be back up in a couple days."" And guess what then happens? Those fuckers send us a bill. A bill for a whole month of non-existent internet connection.

Told them to fuck off, got O2 internet (via landline) instead, had it up and running within 24 hours. It was slightly slower than Virgin (14Mbps instead of the promised 20) and slightly more expensive (had to pay for the landline), but at least it was working.

Basically, the Lib Dem vote dropped by a similar amount to that of the other two main parties, suggesting that these are voters who simply can't be bothered to vote in by-elections, but who vote in general elections and are fairly evenly spread between those parties.

Aside from Rotheram (which went insane), it wasn't that these votes went to another party, they just didn't vote. This then works out as a big gain for Labour because most of these (aside from Corby) were already Labour strongholds, so losing the same number of votes works out as a percentage increase.

As for the Lib Dems fixing this, it is still far too early for them to start trying to pull their weight; there are only so many issues they can fight on (and have the money to campaign on) and the next general election campaign is still 2 years away. They may be better keeping quiet and hoping the Tories are torn apart by the UKIP lobby, and Labour keep being ineffective, and then ramping up their efforts in a year or so's time (taking the losses in local council and maybe EU elections in 2013-14).

I was bowling with friends, but the stakes were high. Bragging rights were to be had, and considering we don't go bowling a lot, these rights would be valid for a long time. I was second, 5 points behind the leader, and it was my last bowl. It was also to be the last bowl of the night. 

I got into my zone, waited calmly for my favourite ball (the lightest one because I have the upper body strength of a child) and took my place. The motion was smooth, timing perfect, lovely speed, lovely length and lovely line. Looked set for a strike, or at least the chance for a spare, and therefore the game. 

However, whilst I was preparing, I failed to notice some idiot in the next lane over. His bowl was so atrocious, that he actually managed to throw the ball into *my* lane, meaning there were now two balls on the lane. This wasn't an issue, however, as it hadn't impeded the motion of my ball, but the issue was what he did next. Which was running onto *my* lane in a desperate attempt to try and make amends for his fuck-up. Stepping over the line, of course, faulted my turn, meaning I received a zero. And therefore lost the match. This all took place in the space of about two seconds.

This is how Doctor Who is(Well, except for stiffing McGann on a regeneration scene). It changes, it evolves, it lets go of its past so it can reinvent itself.

This has nothing whatsoever to do with ""gentlemanly rules"", it has to do with the responsibilities of people's jobs and how government can possibly function.

Too often in these forums reality takes a back seat to a rant. It's ridiculous, it is immature, and it shows a complete misunderstanding of the issues.

If Vince Cable was a backbencher he could rant as much as he liked and there is little anyone could do to stop him (as evidenced by others).

Vince Cable is however a senior Cabinet Minister. Together with other Cabinet Ministers he signs up to and is responsible for the direction of the government. Major decisions are discussed, others are left to the ministers in charge of their own departments.

He doesn't have the ability to go after his cabinet colleagues, complain about the direction agreed by the cabinet at large, or the government policies. That would plunge the government into public chaos whereby there would be no unified government direction, with each cabinet minister making it clear what they did and did not support, with each cabinet minister fielding public criticism from their colleagues.

Government does not, and cannot work that way.

It's not ""gentlemanly rules"" it's your job. If Vince Cable wants to attack government policy or his colleagues and their policies he can resign and do it from the backbenches. That's his ONLY option and can be his ONLY option.

Therefore, complaining about the Lib Dems in Cabinet not voicing their discontent about government policy is ridiculous and stupid, given that they are prevented from doing just that.",0,1355515690,null,0,false,0,c7gn3en,t3_14tznv,t1_c7gn3en,t1_c7glsys,null,1430674733,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Would I rather we had become successful without the money? Possibly, but then I lived in Liverpool for many years when they were coming to the end of the 'glory days', and their attitude when that happened was sickening. They had a sense of entitlement like you wouldn't believe. Like how dare they not be winning things, because they had won everything for 20 years. Similar to the attitude of many United fans now. To be fair to Liverpool, most of them have got over that now - didn't take too long.

Anyone who thinks those teams got there (or stayed there) because of history, without money, or because they just ""earned it"" is deluded. City have as much history as any club. Some good, some bad. ""History"" is generally used to mean ""Success"", unfortunately. If it was down to just History, Notts County should be top of the league.

The mistake that many people make is that there is any way I could change the team I support. It's as much part of me as the colour of my eyes, or my blood group. It's simply not going to happen.

So with all due respect to the following teams, I would rather be where we are than a club with ""loads of history"" like Preston, Blackpool, Burnley, Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield, Ipswich, Accrington Stanley, Derby, Forest, Leeds or anyone else.

It sounds like you're on the right side already, but if the terms are good (i.e. not loans), take the money and we'll see you back at the top of the league and all the naysayers can go off and support Barnet or Enfield ;)

If the KGB broke in, they wouldn't publicize it in case that resulted in the security holes getting patched. If a journalist broke in, his editor wouldn't run the story because he wouldn't want to be charged. If a script kiddy broke in, he couldn't blab to the adults in case he got into trouble.

You get a range of online lectures which are rather good. A module worth 1/8 of an entire years study might have 20 hours of lectures. So that would be the equivalent of 160 hours of lectures for a year. Not bad. 

Furthermore, you get a specific subject guide for each unit/module that is very good, with notes, questions, exercises etc.

It is certainly not for everyone and it requires a lot more discipline that regular study. However, it is certainly possible to reach a high level in non practical subjects ( obviously you can't learn to ride a hose via distance learning ) through online learning.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I was on a phone then so couldn't properly explain. Excuse me if I am telling you what you already know but I don't know your background.

There are three parts of BT - BT Retail, BT Wholesale, Openreach.

It is BT retail who sell phone lines, broadband/Infinity, BT Vision and so on to the public. They are at bt.com. 

BT Wholesale is another part of BT which runs a broadband access network - it is they that own the equipment in the exchange if you have normal ADSL and are with BT Retail or one of many ISPs that pay BT Wholesale for use of that network.

Openreach is the part of BT that owns all of the copper/fibre lines, the exchanges, and the ever growing fibre to the cabinet/fibre to the home network. Openreach deals with several different companies - communication providers - which include BT itself plus its competitors.

I don't know how Openreach figures out return on investment, but my original point was that Openreach will probably be basing its numbers on all of its customers (the ISPs, including BT) numbers, not just BT Retail's numbers.

So I doubt that it's a ""lack of BT customers"" unless literally everyone is on Virgin cable where you are. But then I'd have thought BT would want to get it installed so that they can compete on a fairer basis (Virgin Media 50/100Mbit that works occasionally vs. BT 8/24Mbit that might never get those speeds).

Even if BT don't want to invest, they aren't stopping anyone else from investing. There are a few places in the UK (parts of Yorkshire, a village in Rutland) who have fibre optic cabinets from third parties using BT's cables to connect to houses.

[Above two sources in context](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2015:1-20&amp;version=ERV)

[Reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Cultures_and_religions) why circumcision is carried out in Islam are similar to the Jewish reasons for circumcision.

The reasoning behind this is that humans are without flaw. But would flawless people ever need forgiveness? Would Jesus have been needed if christianity viewed humans as flawless and perfect?

Hope that helps, also now that you could read the religious text that explains the basis for the belief you can't get better sources than that. No false positives when you can read the source and form your own opinion :)

This narrowed it down to Liverpool and Everton for me since my lady friend's family are Liverpool supporters and Everton has Tim Howard who I had some knowledge of. Fortunately for me, someone told me about Spurs and I checked them out. Blue has always been my favorite color. I loved the history better and realized we don't just buy success, we earn it and develop it. So with that I made my decision to follow Spurs. It definitely helped and after deciding, Spurs fired Harry and hired AVB so I felt like I wasn't just jumping into the middle of a story, but rather meeting up from a common spot with other Spurs supporters.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I thought Virgin used the old NTL fibre cables under the road into your property? Maybe I'm just out of date and missing something.

Virgin Media is basically NTL and Telewest combined plus a rebrand. The Virgin Group and Branson own very little of Virgin Media (although they are the largest shareholder) and VM pays Virgin for the use of the brand.

Their network is practically unchanged from the NTL days too. It is fibre to a cabinet (which might not be the one in your street), then copper coaxial cable in to your house. This is called a HFC (""hybrid fibre-coaxial"") network. It is not FTTP and never has been (for residential purposes anyway)

&gt; Surely FTTP is faster than FTTC? If it is meant to be faster, it makes you question why I receive a faster/equivalent speed than somebody who is connecting through their property.

FTTP can be faster (theoretically) as you can push more data through a fibre without having to worry about loss, crosstalk, electrical interference. It's also practically not distance dependent (there's a maximum distance but I think for the system BT use it's tens of kilometres). 

The practical limits are mostly what the network operator chooses to sell. For example, BT's maximum FTTP speed is something like 330Mbits and it doesn't matter where you live, as long as BT are serving you. The network and equipment is capable of much more. Meanwhile, for FTTC, it's 80Mbit and even then you will need to be close to to the cabinet to get the full speed.

&gt; I'm connecting through the cabinet yet receive an equivalent or higher download/upload than the original poster.

So is the original poster. It's practically certain than he/she is not on a fibre to the premises service - Virgin don't offer it, unless you're a business with the cash to spend, and then you wouldn't be posting here as it should be flawless.

&gt; I'm also aware BT have FTTP in some places. Not in my area unfortunately. However I always assumed if I got the chance it would provide a faster speed, is this not the case?

If FTTP was available and you paid for the correct speed tier (e.g. 330Mbits) then yes it would be much faster than you are ever likely to get from FTTC (unless you start bonding multiple lines together or other techniques)

You will get the opportunity later on next year to have FTTP, if you can already get FTTC and want to pay for the installation costs (quite eyewatering) - it's called ""FTTP on demand"" and here's a news story about it - http://www.thinkbroadband.com/news/5614-first-official-indications-of-fibre-on-demand-pricing-from-openreach.html.

How many home games does your school play each season? 

I'll use Michigan, a very popular team with a massive capacity, as an example. They played 7 home games all last season. Spurs will at the least play 23 before we're done, and we've had 11 already. 

The gulf in price between going to a college game and going to a professional sports game is pretty substantial. Sticking with Michigan, after you make a donation (the cheapest of which is under $100) season tickets are $65 per game, so $455 in total. I don't know how it works at big schools like this, but I also have to assume students get in free or at least pay very little. The cheapest Spurs season ticket package is almost 3 times that much. 

Even if we go pro, the cheapest NFL season ticket packages are substantially cheaper than what you'd pay for most EPL licenses. Though to be fair, in terms of value you get a lot more of it with European football.

Add onto this the fact that Spurs are competing for attendance with about a dozen other London-based clubs and it becomes pretty clear.

It takes a very popular football club to sell out massive capacities for 20+ home games a season. And really the clubs who do are usually playing closer to 30 because of cup runs and Europe. I'm talking the likes of Barcelona, Madrid, the Milan teams, United. There's a reason only a handful of teams can do this.

You will find that total attendance of Association Football dwarfs that of any other sport worldwide, but it's just a lot more economically feasible to go to 7 or 8 games than it is to go to 30.

&gt; but if it is FTTC then it is the same service that BT offers.

That's debatable. They are both FTTC in the sense of how the network is constructed, but they operate in very different ways. I don't want to get in to too much detail, but in short BT's FTTC network is far more capable (customers have dedicated lines to cabinet equipment, cabinet equipment has very high capacity pipe to exchange) whereas Virgin's is not (everyone connected to a cabinet shares the same physical connection as it is just split many ways like a TV aerial splitter but on a large scale).

BT's street cabinets probably have at least 1Gbit (symmetrical) connections to their exchanges, whereas Virgin's cabinets have at best about 300-400Mbit of downstream bandwidth, maybe 100Mbit upstream? 

Since for Virgin only about 4 100Mbit customers or 8 50Mbit customers can use up all of the capacity, and a cabinet can serve tens or hundreds of homes, it's not surprising that congestion is rife on parts of Virgin's network and why they have to resort to traffic shaping, speed capping and other techniques. So much for Usain Bolt, eh?

Virgin's network was designed and built primarily for cable television, whereas BT's network is designed for high speed data (although you could argue shoehorning 80Mbit/s down ancient copper wasn't the intention when it was put in decades ago)

If you're interested look up on how DOCSIS works (it's the network protocol that Virgin uses).

&gt; Lets say a lot of people are online and using their computers for a certain cabinet in your general area. Does this have an impact on your individual households speed or is it determined on a unique basis?

I think I partially answered that above. If there is congestion because demand is exceeding supply it's going to affect everyone, but how much it affects everyone depends on how BT or Virgin have set up their networks as far as quality of service etc is concerned. I know that BT (or Openreach really) explicitly guarantee bandwidth for each customer, I think it's 12Mbit/s for residential services. I don't think Virgin guarantee anything.

&gt; Is this what causes slower than expected internet speeds or is it the ISP throttling speeds?

Lots of reasons - line length, congestion, weather conditions (Virgin's cabinets have been known to get unhappy when things are too hot and modems might disconnect or act up, and dodgy BT lines aren't helped by wet weather), etc.

How or if an ISP throttles is their own choice, but I don't think any ISPs will do it based on an individual cabinet or street. For ISPs using BT's network it would be on a national basis.",0,1355527875,null,0,1355528156,0,c7gqpy0,t3_14u6ky,t1_c7gqpy0,t1_c7gqfw9,null,1430676513,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They use a satellite called Astra 2D which has a footprint that roughly covers the entire British Isles, bits of France and Holland too. There is no satellite where you can restrict its footprint to just cover the United Kingdom. It's the only game in town.

Therefore when British broadcasters are paying for licenses for shows etc, a factor in the cost is the number of potential viewers which includes the 4.5M+ population of Ireland. British broadcasters just eat that cost. Some channels like C4 will actually target Irish audiences during their commercial break for their NI transmission (they used to just target NI audiences).

So RTÉ can't really use that satellite because the cost of show/movie licences would rocket as not only would they have to pay for 4.5M potential viewers in Ireland, they would also have to pay for the potential 60M+ population of the UK (I can't remember the correct current pop.) RTÉ is part funded by license fees like the BBC.

Consequently Ireland has rolled out a digital terrestrial television service called Saorview (means Freeview) which Britain can't pick up and have recently turned off their analogue signal.

Also there are a few other considerations. The couples may in fact be practicing Christians and religious doctrine like other philosophies change over time to reflect the nature of society at large. Being a Christian today would be a lot different to what it meant to be a Christian in Roman times for instance. I think many intrinsically understand this and are trying to force the change.

Another reason is tradition.

true,-Photo_Finish-,null,null,"And I *especially* despise it when people throw around quotes like this. State your own opinion, because these quotes can be interpreted in different ways. I've seen some people be complete twats on purpose and upon getting called out, point to quotes like these as justification. Not everyone does this of course, but it is because of this is why I would much rather people say things in their own words. I see it as saying people shouldn't go through their lives and expect not to be offended. That people shouldn't have a right to get rid of things that offend them.

Being offended in and of itself is not a bad thing, and does not automatically make someone wrong. It means something has offended you. This is an undesirable feeling so it is understandable that people will want to complain. The important thing to weigh is how many people it offends, and how badly. The accusation of being easily offended is just a way of saying that they're a part of a minority that finds something offensive that the vast majority of other people do not. I find this a mean thing to say as it pretty much trivialises someone's feelings. It's an easy way to throw consideration for them aside.

So often I see people acting as if being offended is a bad thing, and use it as just a way to try to pass the blame to the person who was offended, so any criticism can easily be ignored. By no means am I saying that just because no fault lies with the offendee, then it must lie with the offender. But yes, just because someone is offended by something, doesn't necessarily mean that anything needs to be done about whatever it was that caused the offence. But neither should it mean that you can just go and ignore people's opinions.

All I said is that they shouldn't be called easily offended. It's mean to pass judgement on someone like that just because they find something offensive that you don't. Calling them that is just an ad hominem. The worst kind at that; one that isn't even necessarily true and is just the opinion of the speaker. At least usually they have some basis in reality (e.g. calling someone a neckbeard might not be a good argument, but at least it's verifiable) whereas calling someone easily offended is *just* opinion.

Another thing about that quote that bothers me is that it uses emotive words like ""whine"". Complaints aren't inherently bad, but if you call it a whine all of a sudden it's bad?

How about people listen to one other rather than finding ways to discredit each other. Chances are, something will be learned by one of, if not both, sides.",0,1355530433,null,0,1355530698,0,c7greaw,t3_14utqe,t1_c7greaw,t1_c7gqgqd,null,1430676839,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

This season though we have started playing a lot more attack minded football, and I think having attack minded central midfielders, and 2 pacy wingbacks instead of one has aided that.  Fellaini is able to bully central defenders and disrupt play at the back, and finishes very effectively which makes him so lethal up there. 

But I do think that Moyes may opt to go with a 2 striker formation as his main plan B for when the team needs to score.  Vellios has been very effective off the bench, partially because he allows Fellaini to drop back to a deep-lying roll and start plays from there.

To be honest, I think for the time being Vellios is fine as our main substitute striker, at least until Anichebe is fit.  Mirallas and Naismith can also play as a second striker. I also think defensive reinforcements and maybe a midfielder should be our priority.  On the other hand, purchasing Rémy would show real ambition on the part of the board.

I'm going to call a return to the starting line-up for Jerome Thomas (Hall seems very much like an impact sub to me, right now), and if we win then I think it's definitely worth highlighting how pivotal his role in the team is. We might also see Diouf starting instead of McCormack, which is arguably a more natural fit as Diouf is the kind of player who retains possession, while I feel that McCormack's playing style is about taking more chances when you get the ball.

Nevertheless, I'm going for **2-1 to Ipswich** because I have a bad feeling in the back of my head about this game and want to protect myself from feeling too bad about a bad result, if it does happen.

Until you experience some bad times and stick with it, you will only be know as a ""fair weather"" fan as you have only experienced the good times.

How many supporters do you reckon united would hold on to if they got relegated to the championship and then relegated again to div 1?  Bugger all.  Most of the supporters who only started liking them because they were winning things at the time they decided to follow EPL, would bail for the exact reason they never picked Bolton or Sheffield United or Manchester City when they started following English football - they aren't winning things.  True bandwagons!

By the way, a mid-table finish or a few years not competing for trophies is not a ""bad time"".  The reason City supporters are so awesome is that we appreciate the time we are having now because of where we come from just a few years ago.  Not like other ""big"" club's fans who carry on like it's the end of the world when they get knocked out of a cup or finish don't compete for a trophy for a couple of years.

I think we need to stop lying to ourselves and accept even though he said he wants to stay, he is still *at least* considering his options.

He's 18, flamboyant and has and is about to make a lot of money, we cant just take into account playing but many other things that are not football related and that unfortunately will play a factor in his choice.

I don't think United are interested in him at all, (maybe a little to see how we respond) I think there showing this interest to fuck with us and fuck with his head. 

We know it's only a matter of time before we're competing again but were talking years, this fake interest from United may fill his head with idea's about quick glory, increased public and media attention, lets again be honest every young guy dreams about being that player at the centre of attention and (going by his Twitter and from what BR has said he certainly likes attention) United would certainly be able to provide that. 

**Arsenal:**

Now Arsenal scare me.. they have an appeal that might attract him both on and off the pitch. 

like I said before he's 18, flamboyant and has and is about to make a lot of money, Liverpool is nice but London is where everything happens and its especially amazing when you have money. Sterling is a (excluding Jamaica) London lad, a lot of his family still live there and going by the things he says he likes and from the tweets about loving London there's definitely appeal and I dont think he'd have too much trouble settling back. 

As for the team, Im afraid to say he'd fit in well there, they may not be as possessive but they certainly have that need for speed and Wenger is maybe the only other manager that would be able to get the best out of Sterling as he develops.

----------------------------------------------

Again, I dont think he'll leave but he a kid with a very bright future ahead of him and he needs to make the decision do I leave for quick glory or do I stay and earn it.

A problem of a multi-epsiode show is shared with comic books and soap operas; it's difficult to show characters growing or maturing despite harrowing life lessons because you can't count on the audience be following the back history beyond what's in the current episode. The episodes which do make reference to the past (e.g. Time Crash) quickly become favorites of long time fans even if they don't make much sense to a new viewer.

When a show runner, lead actor, or companion changes, it's an opportunity to start fresh. By necessity of having a fifty year show, they can jettison the baggage (and lessons and maturity) acquired in hopes of attracting new viewers.

I studied abroad at Uni Edinburgh last year, it was without doubt the best semester of my college career.

To the comments about binge drinking - that was probably one of my best authentic Scottish experiences. Drink a bottle of Buckfast, go out to some shitty club with cheap drink specials and vomit in the street on the way home. It's a part of the Scottish experience. I gained some great stories from drinking with Scots.

I don't understand why anyone would complain about NHS. I dealt with health services twice in Scotland and both times I was beyond impressed. Service was rendered faster than in the US and it was free. One of my friends was freaking out that her insurance wouldn't cover all of her medical bills from when she fell down in the street drunk and cut her face open, and yet when we got to the hospital, they assured her treatment would be free. We were all pretty dumbfounded.

As far as living, I lived in Sciennes. I had friends living in Pollock, on Cowgate, a few other places and in private flats. I lived with two freshers and another junior, all of whom were international (Indonesia, Bulgaria and China). We didn't get along so well, but it was fine. Other friends of mine who were studying abroad became best friends with their flatmates.

Just go out there and have fun. Make friends with people in your classes. Join student groups. If your program has trips (mine did), go on them. I got to go on a few highland tours for really cheap that way. Scots are, in general, really nice people. Edinburgh isn't the biggest city in the world but it has a lot going on. You can hike Arthur's Seat or the Pentlands, go out to Leith, explore New Town and Old Town and enjoy the lively scene that the whole city provides.

Also, it'll rain almost every day.  Bring a good raincoat.

Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions.

If a local faith group believes in the anti-gay religious message and that is their group's stance, then it stands to reason that the gay religious person is not practicing the same faith... not really. it's a subtle difference but a big one.

Why is the govenment not combatting religious homophobia, the root cause, rather than this particular aspect?

Fair enough.

true,shoseki,null,null,"Hate to break it to you, but most of the people I know joke about rape... in fact the more if offends people, the more likely it is to become a source of amusement. Call it an immature mindset if you like. On the one hand rape happens in huge amounts in parts of the developing world (and elsewhere), is a real thing that destroys lives. On the other hand, the human mind does things to cope with terrible things, its pretty well known that Doctors have a what we would call disturbed sense of humour to deal with the nasty shit they have to deal with. i imagine (but you can pull me up on this) that trivialising a word and trivialising an act are two separate things - if a doctor made cancer jokes I'm sure that people would be up in arms, yet cancer happens and we have to deal with it. So rather than speaking hushly in reverence (or the opposite) about something, I'd rather get it out and in the publics' conscious.

I'm a strong believer that comedy should be a bit like Total War, ie no holds barred, and if someone finds it funny, so be it. You should be able to stand by your joke. However, there is a big difference between finding something funny and condoning it. After all, laughter is the release of endorphins as a coping mechanism, not because the topic *itself* is funny.

On the other hand, its a pretty cheap and douchey joke by someone trying to promote their pub. I might have chuckled if I'd thought it was unintentional, but knowing it was intentional makes it slightly creepy, which is why I agree it should have been taken down.

Agreed, this is a big can of worms with no obvious solution.

I guess all I'm saying is that over the years some churches have relaxed or changed their stance on certain other issues, and I'm a bit mystified why some are so stuck on this one, particularly when statistically speaking something like 5% (no really accurate figure exists) of their members are likely to be gay themselves.

I'm against the government forcing churches to do/not do anything unless there is some law being broken, but from a legal point of view any church's rules are a bit of a grey area, and yes often a bit daft.

I just wish they'd grow up and realise that homosexuality is a normal part of the variations in human genetics, like being tall or short or blonde or whatever, and get over it.

Any motor vehicle driver would anticipate a person in a parked vehicle opening the door, and be prepared for it. Whereas the cyclist in question just continued oblivious, and paid the ultimate price for it.

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"Imagine you are part of a religion that is fine with the the fact you are gay, and happy to marry you. At the moment they can't.

As you say if a religion chooses to exclude gays, then so be it. As i understand it it's not forcing religion to conduct gay marriages. It's about allowing a gay friendly church to conduct gay marriages *if it wants*.

The complicating issue, is that some of those religions that *don't* want gay marriage, see it as wrong that any church can. And some see it as a general erosion and worry that this would be the first step to one day forcing them to conduct gay marriages that they don't want to, either through further changes to our law (building on these changes) or through a challenge through European courts.

Hence the so called quadruple lock, 

• no religious organisation, or individual minister, could be compelled to marry same-sex couples (or to permit this to happen on their premises);

• it will be unlawful for religious organisations, or their ministers, to marry same-sex couples unless the organisation's governing body has expressly opted in to do so (and that would mean the religious organisation itself opting in, the presiding minister having consented and the premises in which the marriage is to be conducted having been registered);

• the Equality Act 2010 would be amended to ensure that no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations or individual minister for refusing to marry a same-sex couple (or allowing their premises to be used for this purpose); and

• the Bill will explicitly state that it would be illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry same-sex couples, or to opt in to do so. Canon law - which bans the marriage of same-sex couples - will continue to apply. That means that it would require a change in both primary and canon law before the Church of England and Church in Wales would be able to opt in to conduct same-sex marriages.""

As you can see it's not about forcing churches, to conduct weddings under duress, but about allowing those who do want to, while reassuring those that don't they'll never have to (as most sensible people would see a compelled ceremony under duress as less than desirable anyway.)

I've never had a TV, and for my entire adult life I've had the volleys of letters every time I've moved house. I *know* it's extremely annoying, and wrong - but really, the easiest solution is to get your head around the fact that it's best to simply ignore them.

File the letters in the fire, or the cat litter tray, or whatever; be aware that you are under no obligation whatever to allow them into your house in the unlikely event that they turn up (they never have in my case). If they show up, be polite, but firm, and inform them that you refuse permission for them to use your garden / path, if you have one. That way they can't knock on the door ever again. On no account let them into your house unless they have a policeman with them. 

I am not a lawyer, incidentally.

Yes, I looked in to it quite thoroughly and apparently the license is needed for the receipt of live TV signals as opposed to just owning a TV.

Theoretically anyone with a smartphone, tablet or similar should also have a TVL regardless of whether they have TV receiving software as those platforms are fully capable of receiving live TV via various apps etc. 

According to TV Licensing, ""You need a TV Licence to use any television receiving equipment such as a TV set, digital box, DVD or video recorder, PC, laptop or mobile phone to watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV"". 

The BBC has stated that a licence is not needed simply because a television receiver is owned.

I can see why you find it strange that gay couples would want to get married in church (if I was gay, I certainly wouldn't), however, there are gay people who are also religious.  This would allow them to have a marriage ceremony equal to that already available to heterosexual couples.

At the moment, the civil-partnership available to gay couples is seen by many as a second-tier offering; this proposed legislation would go some way to fixing that.

true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"It's not an issue of being ""fair"", it's about balance of risk. You, as a driver, aren't going to get killed by a cyclist if he runs a red light, **but** you might very well kill a cyclist if you do the same. It's entirely appropriate that the driver be more carefully regulated.

When you're driving, you have multi-ton piece of glass and steel moving at very speeds and you're going to put lots of other people at risk if you don't follow some simple rules. All those you've outlined. Even with those precautions, people die in car accidents every day.

When you're walking around, as a pedestrian, any stupid shit you pull is really only putting your life at risk, for the most part. Personally, I find pedestrians to by the most inconsiderate road users, the routinely ignore traffic lights, junctions, they wander into traffic, and so on, but I don't rage about because the risk is on them.

Cyclists fall somewhere between, but the risk is much lower than a car, so the appropriate level of regulation is lower.

Menace?

It's not cyclists killing and injuring other road users and pedestrians in their thousands.  It's not cyclists causing grid lock during rush hour Monday - Friday, 52 weeks a year.  It's not cyclists killing other road users with their negligible actions.

http://www.ctc.org.uk/file/public/pedestriansbrf_2.pdf

It's not cyclists being at fault in the vast majority of accidents and causing a 12% raise in pedestrian deaths.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19746515

Menace?  **Menace?**

Fuck off!

We're doing you a favour not adding another car to the road.

The sooner more city and town centres are aimed at pedestrians rather than the car, the better.  Bring on automated driving units.

**Edit:** The reason I'm so pissed off with comments like this is that as a cyclist that does obey the rules of the road, has bright lights front and back, has a high-vis and generally stays the fuck away from larger vehicles, I still get treated like shit on the road every ride by at least one driver and god forbid I dare to ""take the lane"" when passing door zones or going though pinch points by impatient and aggressive drivers.

So I apologise for the swearing and all that, but FUCK.  Cycle a mile in our shoes and you'll get it.

Terrorists know that getting luggage onto a flight without the corresponding passenger is impossible. If someone doesn't show at the gate they pull their luggage from the hold. Ergo, if you want to attack a plane up in the 21st century the easiest way to do it was to have someone on board.

They weren't that religious, many spent the preceding nights at strip bars. They were attacking an iconic building of a nation that they perceived had caused them harm in some way. And given the history of US foreign policy, that's really not too much of a stretch to understand. 

The whole ""72 virgins"" thing is nonsense, the only people that actually believe it are the writers at the Daily Mail. The Koran doesn't mention it nor does it mention rewards for martyrdom.

Right. But then there are gay Quakers. The Quaker church doesn't consider being gay to be a sin, and is pro-gay marriage, and some gay Quakers want to get married in a Quaker church. 

But they can't because the government says so.

This isn't about forcing anyone to do anything. It's about letting religious people do what they want, without state interference.

If I were to cancel my plan with my US provider and bring my iPhone, could I get a plan with a UK provider and keep my current phone? Or is there some sort of region restriction on most telephones. I would hate to have to buy a new telephone if I do not have to.

Make sure your phone isn't locked to a phone network stateside (although you could get it unlocked here for a small fee). Modern phones support most standards so unless you've got some weird CDMA-only handset (which I don't think exists amongst iPhones anyway) you'll be fine. Pop in a GiffGaff SIM, add some cash to it and you're good to go. Like Helzibah said, you don't need to pay to receive calls or texts (to be honest the very idea seems crazy to us Brits!).

&gt;Is it possible for me to rent a car and legally drive it with a US driving license?

Can you drive a manual transmission vehicle? Most cars here aren't automatic and this can be a bit of a stumbling block for many. Whilst I'd be amazed if you weren't able to rent an automatic it might make the process smoother if you're familiar with manual.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; I agree with daveime. I see cyclists doing stupid shit ALL the time. 

Funny, as a pedestrian I see motorists putting us in danger every single time I'm near a road, I can not walk on the main street in Leeds (Headrow) without seeing a driver speeding to beat a set of lights or going over the white line at crossings.

The reality of who's a danger on our roads and who runs red lights:

According a Freedom of Information (FoI) request made in 2008, in London, where cycle and 
pedestrian flows are high and signalled junctions ubiquitous: 

**No pedestrian was killed in collision with a cyclist going through a red light between 1998-2007** 
and cyclists were involved in only a small percentage of injuries to them. 

**Vehicles involved in pedestrian fatalities**

http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/sep/28/road-deaths-great-britain-data

&gt; 233 pedestrians died following collisions with single cars - more than were killed in incidents involving any other type of vehicle.

&gt; 65 pedestrians were killed in incidents involving two or more vehicles, while 61 died after a collision with an HGV or light goods vehicle (LGV). Two pedestrians died after collisions with cyclists - fewer than any other vehicle.

On the other hand, I can find deaths from motorists jumping red lights including the case where two [children died](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9458112/Two-toddlers-in-pushchairs-die-after-car-jumps-red-light.html).

**6,000** motorists caught jumping red lights in the same road in only one week:

http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/slough/articles/2012/08/02/61547-more-than-6000-motorists-caught-jumping-red-lights-in-the-same-road-in-only-one-week/

**15,000** motorists caught jumping red lights in Bristol (plus **120,000** going on courses for breaking the speed limits):

http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/15-000-motorists-caught-jumping-red-lights-Bristol/story-11252121-detail/story.html

*But yea,  bloody cyclists, shud pay road tax innit I pay road tax mate!!!, always going through red lights, boils my piss mate, shud run em ova like!*

Let's put it down to facts we can all agree on:

[In the last 10 years](http://www.ctc.org.uk/file/public/pedestriansbrf_2.pdf):

Deaths by motorists: 3722
Injuries by motorists: 50179

Deaths by cyclists: 22
Injuries by cyclist: 510

As a pedestrian, I'm terrified by motorists and rightly so.  They are statistically reckless and I'm likely to encounter them on a daily basis.

&gt; And those shitty cyclists need to be banned from the road or restricted, just the same as shitty car drivers are.

No!

Our defence was hideous for sure, but we were punished for every single mistake in an unusually ruthless fashion. Yes we shouldn't be making those mistakes, but you don't expect to be punished so harshly every time you make one, particularly by Villa. 

I don't think Villa brought much to the match besides a solid yellow mass in their penalty area. Some of their counter-attacking was decent, but probably not good enough to warrant three goals. We dominated possession and created a huge number of chances, but as usual the spectre of not having recognised goal-scorers in the squad was our curse. Too many times promising balls entered the box only to be happily received by Villa players, with nary a striker around. Suarez simply doesn't play that way unfortunately.

Our negatives were obvious, we're still giving the ball away too cheaply at times. Allen is in need of a rest and Lucas wasn't on song today either. Our defence was shocking at times, Skrtel in particular was at fault on a number of occasions. Reina could have done more with their first goal imo, not sure what happened, seems like he was trying to anticipate *too* much that the ball would be passed, but wrong-footed himself. Poor by his standards, especially considering he came out and said recently that he's back to his best.

That said, I still saw good stuff from us today, plenty of nice inter-passing around the area, one-touch stuff that was pleasant and could easily be dangerous with more predatory players on the end of it. Our attitude was good too, we never let the scoreline get us down, and pressed until the death, managing to squeeze out a consolation goal and rub their annoying keeper's nose in it.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"This would be the end of the argument, I cannot think of a single thing to say to in any way contradict any of this. 

However, there's one thing you've overlooked.

Opponents of gay marriage, or rather, religious opponents of gay marriage, who are against it for reasons of their faith, do not oppose gay marriage inside their church. They oppose gay marriage as an entire concept. There is no situation where they would be comfortable with it. It does not matter if the people are of their religion or not, it does not matter if the people is male or female, if they're eighteen or eighty, it doesn't even matter if the people are outstanding members of the community and extremely close friends with many members of the local church's congregation. No gay marriage, period.

The only problem with your argument is precise what you said. Practice the religion or GTFO. If the religious in this instance were campaigning for the right to say ""we don't want to wed homosexuals here"" then fine. However, that isn't what they're campaigning for, they're campaigning against gay marriage in it's entirity.

Let me try and draw a parallel. Have you ever heard of a Jewish person trying to outlaw pork?

How about a Buddhist trying to outlaw avidya, which is more or less their only concept of sin?

Or perhaps a Muslim trying to outlaw the depiction of their proph-oh wait.

The point is that you're right. You're absolutely right, if you choose to be part of a faith that doesn't allow gay marriage then it's your own fault, but that isn't what the churches in this instance have spent years campaigning for, and that's why it's honestly wrong. In the example of the Jew and the Buddhist, they don't do those things because those things are offensive to their religion and not anyone else's. They expect their own kith and kin to abstain from such things, but do not ask it of those that don't share their beliefs.

As much as I'd much rather not get into an argument about Islam, though it must be noted that Islamic countries are much more highly critical of homosexuality in general than western nations, the instance of the Muslim and the Prophet, and the Christian and the Homosexual Wedding are examples of doing it wrong.",0,1355591707,null,0,false,0,c7h1b2e,t3_14vbd7,t1_c7h1b2e,t1_c7gy7qh,null,1430681597,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The midfield looks so disorganized, I've haven't said this out loud before but it's been in my head for the last two and a half years or so, but Gerrard needs to be dropped to the bench. I don't care that he is a club legend or a captain. Gerrard would not start for any team in the top 6 let alone the top 8 especially on his current form. He has lost his passion and you can see it in his eyes when he plays. theres no drive anymore. Its almost as if his head is else where(family? his 3 little girls?).

Enough of captain bashing this leads me to the next fellow who needs to be on the bench for next game. Raheem Sterling. Everyone in the league has figured out this fellow. Hes extremely one dimensional in the sense that you know he is going to his right foot. Even when the ball is setup on his left, he still opts to use his right. Yes, he is very impressive for a 17 year old but that does not mean he has the right to start game in and game out week to week. Not to mention he looks lethargic out there and has for the past 3-4 weeks. 

Skagger. They were missing on the defensive side of the ball today. They had their moments in the attack, but when we needed them in defense today they were no where to be found. Though this is starting to become a reoccurring theme. We need our rock in the back and these two are the perfect fit, Brendan please address this this week.

We should of put Villa away in the first 15 minutes but this too has become all too familiar. We can't keep saying this week in and week out. Something has to be done and January could not come soon enough. I hope FSG can see what we are lacking and provide Brendan with the funds to do so. They made a big enough deal to go and get him, they should be able to stand up and back him.

Sad to see Suarez get another card immediately after returning from *getting cards*. And, really, over something rather silly. I could easily understand his frustration and why he was fired up, but replays show he was in the wrong and didn't need to get carded.

Their defense was extremely solid. Every time we started to make an offensive push, suddenly there was a knot of players to punch through, and we couldn't do it. We should've, but we couldn't find our way through.

true,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"Reina - I feel like he could've done more on the first goal, but he did well to tackle the ball away outside the box in the first half. Other than that didn't really have that much he could've done. 

Johnson - OK today, looked like player were relying on him for creativity at some points. Takes the blame for the loss as part of our defense, also could question his decision making at times. Still, that's two games in a row he's been a source of a goal.

Skrtel - Poor defending on that third goal, should let the wide runner go and focus on the immediate threat at hand. Could've done better covering on the second goal.

Agger - At least he tried to push us forward in the second half, looked aggressive. Still doesn't excuse letting in 3 at the back, especially on the second goal when he pushed forward too far, missed his tackle, and left a huge gap in the back line. Perhaps he should've cut across earlier on the third goal.

Downing - I actually thought he was decent at LB. A lot of Villa's attacking came through the center, so it's not clear whether that was because our fullbacks did well or Villa just didn't target those areas. He had some nice passes to switch up the play, did well to try and keep possession, put in some low, fast balls near the end. Still, not good enough, but he didn't have me shitting my pants.

Lucas - Expected more from our center defensive midfield talisman. Was caught too far up at times, allowing Villa to break past him. Our midfield was to blame for that first goal, gave Benteke too much space to work with. Because he was being bypassed on Villa's counters, he wasn't really doing that much to boss around play. I kind of feel possession play pulls Lucas too far up and makes him obsolete.

Allen - Wasn't physical enough to close down during the first or third goals, but I'd say the third was just an overall let down by the team's defensive side in general. He pushes forward when we have possession, but isn't able to really impact the offensive side of the game that much. I don't think he had many runs in or passes forward. Where's the Allen we saw the first gameweeks?

Henderson - Refreshing substitution but only for a few minutes. There were moments when he looked like he could add something different (and perhaps he added a bit more forward energy) but overall fell into the same rhythm of the match.

Gerrard - In the first half, he was linking up decently with Suarez and Sterling, and had a few almost chances. Maybe he should've taken that one shot instead of trying to pass it back, who knows. The thing about Gerrard is sometimes he tries almost too hard to always play the pass forward, but sometimes that's what we need. In the second half though, he absolutely disappeared. Don't take his goal to mean he was involved, if anything he pushed up too far forward and wasn't able to get involved with play in the second half.

Sterling - Looked threatening and select times in the first half, but seemed to drop off in intensity after a crunching tackle. Switched between the wings, but to no real avail. His crosses weren't too great, and in the second half, he just seemed to be having a bad day. Couldn't make anything happen on the ball, and found himself bullied off it most of the time. Drew some fouls, though, which were good.

Shelvey - Was happy he was subbed off. Felt like he was not impacting the game much, and in fact was hurting the creative flow of our side. There were many times when he just hesitated too much and let the opportunities slip by, and wasn't able to show much attacking threat either. Had one chance where he might have done better to get a shot off or avoid the defender, but really wasn't impressed.

Cole - Seemed lethargic at times, especially with his give away in midfield that led to the third goal. His substitution was not a bad idea--Shelvey was under performing, perhaps bring on a more experienced player who helped us out last week. Unfortunately his missed volley kind of summed up his performance--looked threatening in theory, but really wasn't able to provide much.

Suarez - Ahh, Suarez. His touch let him down at times, and while he looked threatening, it was never overtly so. Perhaps he should've shot instead of passing it to Shelvey in the first half, but can't fault him too much for that. He needs to take care of his yapping, though. This ref was relatively understanding through the whole match, but at a certain point when Suarez is harasssing him he has to give the yellow. Come on Suarez, channel your energy better. I also feel that he's too inclined to quickly play a one-two, which very usually doesn't pull off. Also, he drops back when he's frustrated of service, but there he just helps clog the play up more.

Hopefully BR gets angry and drops a few non performers today such as Gerrard. Bring him on around 50/60 minutes or so.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I'm going to try to calm down here and talk a little bit about our players today.

Johnson - Too many attempts to cross the ball in. We can't touch the ball in the air, Villa defenders are way, way better than our players in the air.

Downing - Solid game. Clever crosses that were unlike Johnson's, drilled it in against the running players rather than floating it, which will allow anyone in the box to turn the ball into the net, accidentally or not.

Skrtel + Agger: Not the best. Skrtel wasn't on point with his tackles as usual. Agger went forward a few times well, good shot, but was missing in the defence a few times.

Lucas - Invisible. Neither bad nor exceptional, but did decently. A few mistakes, but I hope they'll leave as his form improves due to that injury.

Gerrard - Didn't do very well in the first half. He seemed hesitant to take shots, which saddens me. Picked it up a little bit in the second half but definitely still isn't even close to his usual standard.

Allen - *sigh* Okay going forward. Opens up play well, but can't seem to find passes into our players up front. He does well spreading the ball out, but besides that, offers close to nothing going up front.

Suarez - This is why I love the man, he works his ass off every single game. Very hardworking, MoTM (for our side) for me, like you guys mentioned, the only one that cared after we went down.

Shelvey - Just shoot. Come on. We know you can shoot. *Meh*-inducing game.

Sterling - Does the same thing over and over in attempt to beat his defenders, needs some variety. He's quick, got around the fullback a few times. But he wasted too much time on the ball with no end result, didn't offer much on the left and the right.

Cole - Mistake which led to the third goal, but that was also a defensive error, so not completely blaming him, even though he has to take some of the blame. Like Shelvey, another ""meh-inducing"" game.

Henderson - Looked sharp when he came on, closed down well, slowly lost his tempo with the rest of the team (except Suarez) and didn't offer much after that.

Reina - Couldn't do much to prevent those goals. Did okay. Bold goalkeeping, especially in the first half.",0,1355592744,null,0,false,0,c7h1iz6,t3_14we28,t1_c7h1iz6,t3_14we28,null,1430681706,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

You can buy grass fed beef in the US, but it's generally much more expensive because the government subsidizes corn so corn fed beef is very cheap, although not very healthy for you. I'd say EU beef is much better than US beef if it's illegal to use hormones and lots of medicines.

There are varied options from the main halls at Pollock Halls or the flats which are spread around. 

Public transport is good anyway, but Pollock and several of the flats are probably exactly where you'd want to be. Located in the centre-ish but in the direction of Little France and on the bus route.

The recently renovated commonwealth swimming pool is adjoined to Pollock Halls. There's several other swimming pools too. Arthur's Seat and surrounding is okay for running, again by Pollock Halls. Other popular running/jogging spots is around Inverleith Park, the Water of Leith, maybe Union Canal but prob more for cycling, I'm told there's lots of cycling routes down by the Pentlands, the coast...

a) there are a shitload more cars than bikes on the road, so comparing absolute numbers of incidents or people running red lights isn't a valid comparison

c) When you talk about ""threat"", you're using narrow definitions. Accidents and injuries aren't the only ""threat"". Cyclists may *cause* crashes, but not necessarily be involved in them. I know that I've had to pile the brakes on before because of cyclists who just drifted across the lane or turned without warning. Also, concerning traffic flow, cyclists can cause chaos where one slow wobbling moron on a bike holds up a huge queue of cars. Slowing everybody down, causing queues and generally irritating people (and probably causing more reckless behaviour) should also be classed as a threat.

Basically, if you are sharing the road, you should also be obliged to undergo training and follow rules like everybody else. And there are plenty of rules to follow: https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82/overview-59-to-71.

I didn't say anything about road tax at all, so no point bringing that up - of course bikes shouldn't pay emissions-based tax. I would welcome better bike infrastructure too. That makes everybody happy, since cyclists can be safe, and motorists don't have to share the same road with them.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Most of this is meaningless because: a) there are a shitload more cars than bikes on the road,

As a pedestrian, I'm likely to interact with bad drivers.  As shown by a SINGLE red light.  It's a perfectly valid comparison.

&gt; b) of course a car is inherently more dangerous to hit a person than a bike. That's still not a good argument against cars

yes it is:

http://www.ctc.org.uk/file/public/pedestriansbrf_2.pdf

&gt; This means that in 2010, mile for mile, motor vehicles were 1.35 times more likely than a cycle to seriously injure a pedestrian and about 1.75 times more likely to kill them. 

&gt; Also, concerning traffic flow, cyclists can cause chaos where one slow wobbling moron on a bike holds up a huge queue of cars. Slowing everybody down, causing queues and generally irritating people (and probably causing more reckless behaviour) should also be classed as a threat.

Studies and evidence show otherwise.

&gt; ou can't go trying to separate things based on this vague idea of a ""threat"".

I disagree, France are at least willing to experiment:

He is the energizer bunny for this squad right now.  I would dare say more so than Suarez.  He is truly a box-to-box midfielder.

That said, he has been misplacing more balls recently, and because he is constantly on the play (i.e. gets more touches) I think this sticks out to people.

The problem with replacing him is that there really isn't anyone else on this squad who is constantly hustling their asses off in the midfield.  Lucas is fresh back from injury.

I updated my TV licence address and thought that would be the end of it.  Then the letters started arriving saying I was not licenced.  I rang them 2-3 times, explained the situation but nothing changed.  I'm also not happy at all that the BBC has decided a private company can profit from collecting the licence fees. Then a ""tv inspector"" rang my busser one night.  I refused to let him in the building, said i had a licence then ignored him.   About 18 months ago I got sick of the endless threatening letters and cancelled my direct debt with them.  Every month then send me a letter but I just ignore them.
