If it's part of a larger secret, if it's just a formal version of the alias 'The Doctor', or if it's just an inside joke to The Doctor.

Hell, perhaps it came from when The Doctor first came to Earth. Considering he has an affinity for stealing clothes at hospitals(3, 8, and 11 all got dressed this way), perhaps his first incarnation snuck into a hospital to get human clothes. Upon being caught he claimed his name was 'Doctor' as he had heard several people around him use that name. 'Doctor who?' 'Yes, yes, that's it! Doctor Who. My name is Doctor Who, nice to meet you!' Then, after realizing 'Who' wasn't a name, but being fond of the title 'Doctor', he dropped the 'Who' and kept 'Doctor'.

I think Blink is a good go-to for introducing folks for a few reasons:

1) It's not straight-up Doctor, like, say, New Earth or Gridlock, filled with talking cats or alien worlds.  And while I LOVE aliens and alien worlds, for somebody more used to Earth-based tv, Blink is relatable, it's accessible.  

2) It's still very Doctor-y!  Awesome monsters, witty banter, time travel.

3) A lot of episodes require, if not backstory, some basic familiarity with the Doctor.  Like Family of Blood storyline, you need to already know the Doctor to feel it.

4) Finally, I think Blink can segue really well into Midnight, another twilight zoney x-filesey episode for people coming from that background, but also more Doctor Who-ey.

Big Finish has a contract with the BBC to not write about the Time War. If it really was that irrelevant, they wouldn't care what Big Finish writes. But the BBC acknowledge the fact that fans do pay attention and buy the dramas and books. It's more advantageous for the BBC to not take a strong stance on canon regarding the EU, else you think they would've already. At best, we have the BBC ignoring the EU material except for when it gets them money.

And you don't need to go into the expanded universe to find contradictions. In the show alone Atlantis sinks three times and Sutekh destroys Mars despite Ice Warriors living on it later on and *Waters of Mars* occurring.

Besides the fact that you can reconcile Sound of Drums and *Master* (both of which allude to childhood), there can be more than one reason for going evil. There are ways to tie in theories. I mean, you could say that the Doctor being half human in 1996, being loomed in Lungbarrow, *and* having a family in RTD Doctor Who is all contradictory. But there is an explanation that can tie all those in (and the half-human thing is even optional).",0,1341817869,null,0,false,0,c5bef04,t3_w98w3,t1_c5bef04,t1_c5bebqj,null,1429330753,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,d4mini0n,tardis,TARDIS,"Pretty sure before the new series started and really until at least partially through 10s era 4 was considered the overall ""best"" or at least favorite. Part of that was, I'm sure, that he had the longest run on TV and so the most people had him as their first Doctor like 9 was for you. Tom Baker, who played 4, now says Tennant is his favorite. If you do watch more of the classic series you'll see how much the Doctor stays the same. This is particularly true of 10 and 11 because 10 was a massive fanboy and ""his doctor"" was 5 (coincidence that he married 5's daughter?) so Tennant included a lot of 5s idiosyncrasies. Once you get further into 10s run watch [Time Crash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0cyxb2kG9E) for an explanation of what exactly 10 drew from 5, I think it takes place around the middle of season three. 11 does the same; he brought back a lot of the quirks from the 2nd doctor including a few direct one-liners. This isn't true for 9 because IIRC Eccleston wasn't a fan of Doctor Who before he was cast, I don't think he'd even seen the show before. It's a big part of why some people don't like 9, there are some who are bitter that Eccleston didn't seem to like being on the show and he refuses to come back even for a one-time appearance in the 50th anniversary special. None of this is to say you're wrong for liking 9, or that you need to watch the old series. I've tried and they were made for a different generation. A lot of them are very slow-paced, they make Mad Men look like an action movie, and they were made on a shoestring budget; the first few seasons with the 1st doctor couldn't afford reshoots so bloopers made it to air.

My point is that at the moment we are in a cycle where rents rise, and the state just pays out more. This then causes ""the market rate"" to rise, so then the state pays more. The state is a massive funder of housing, so if it changes the rules then the market will be effected.

At the moment those that don't qualify for public payments (but have taxes taken to fund it) find themselves competing against tenants who have unlimited funds to match or exceed them. It is therefore arguably to say that the current system protects a class of people that got in on great terms, whilst others are excluded.

There is also the situation in the media where special pleading goes along the lines of saying that middle earners can house share or commute for hours a day, but that low earners are exempt from this because they are ""poor"".

GCS QC asks AF about a conversation about LA real estate after the match between AF and JT. AF confirms. Demonstrating friendly, personal conversation and how matter was 'settled' soon after final whistle

Prosecution not calling Ashley Cole or John Obi Mikel. Both in the immediate area so clearly heard nothing offensive

GCS QC: Asks AF if he elbowed JT in the neck, AF denies strongly and says ""Definitely in the side, by accident"". GCS QC shows video evidence of AF launching elbow into JT's neck, knocking him down. AF changes mind and now says ""Yeah, I guess I did, don't remember much from that day""

GCS QC: Asserting that racial allegations exaggerated by AF in order to successfully wind up JT on the pitch, as affair/swearing talk was not having any effect. Key issue being AF used the phrase first and JT repeated it in a sarcastic/questioning manner

13:32 : Still on break since 13:00. Expected back soon. Came at a good time for AF as he was looking very concerned at GCS QC line of questioning

GCS QC: Earlier asked if AF was telling the truth, AF replied he always does and he's an honest person. GCS QC has not brought this up yet but AF was fined 2 weeks wages (£50k) for lying about his whereabouts to West Ham in 2007. May be brought up later, hopefully

Ashley Cole to AF after the game: ""Did you really think JT called you a black cunt? You know he isn't like that""

13:55 : Proceedings resume at 14:00

If Ashley Cole or John Obi Mikel say they heard AF ask the ""Did you call me a black cunt?"" question before JT responded by repeating the phrase sarcastically, this thing is over. Not sure if defence is calling either of them in though

RE: Burden of proof. As this is a criminal case, there must be no doubt for a guilty conviction to be passed down. In a civil case, a certain amount of leeway is allowed (common sense decisions etc.) but no room for that here

90 minutes for lunch? I'm in the wrong profession

14:25 : Nothing new out of court yet, not a peep from anyone. So here's something c/o The Guardian.... GCS QC says Terry asked Ferdinand in changing room ""are you accusing me of calling you a black cunt?"" and Ferdinand said ""no""

14:50 : Test to see if I can post again after 30 mins of 504 errors

GCS QC: Apparently the man who complained to the police is Mr Rigby, PR agent for New Era Group who represent AF and Rio. GCS QC asking if Rigby changed AF's mind and convinced him to also complain to the police. AF denies. GCS QC asks if AF pays Rigby for his services, AF is getting vexed

Daily Mail: They just reported a story featuring the line ""Mr Bridge, who has a child with the model, ended their relationship in the aftermath of the affair."" If anyone wants to complain about this lie in the Daily Fail, have at it here... http://www.pcc.org.uk/complaints/form.html

New Era Sports: Seem to have a Max Ferdinand working for them too. Looks ugly enough to be part of the family... http://www.neweraglobalsports.com/meet-the-team

GCS QC: Accusing AF of changing his story and his details from this morning, in particular the exchanges with Ashley Cole. We know he has a dodgy memory for facts but it was only hours ago AF! Discrediting tactics are in full flow

15:00 : Defence steps back for now as the prosecution will attempt to explain why AF was originally so 'reluctant' to go to the police

!5:00 : That's all from AF. He leaves the stand and we have another break. The crux of GCS QC's argument is that the racist phrase was initially used by AF in order to provoke a reaction from JT once the elbow/affair/swearing had failed",0,1341830277,null,0,1341842511,0,c5bfpy8,t3_w9ie5,t1_c5bfpy8,t3_w9ie5,null,1429331363,41,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,41

Also, the Uni isn't great.

Bristol is awesome and a very good University, by far the best of the three. The city is also brilliant, and in an excellent location to see the South with excellent transport links to the rest of the country (I'm a little biased as I'm from Bristol-but I don't think many people would disagree).

Swansea, is in Wales, but its south Wales, and culturally its pretty damn English, aside from the road signs being in another language you'll have a tough time differentiating it from England.

Swansea itself isn't very big, but the university is good (much better than Bradford, not as good as Bristol), for Wales it has good transport links, (i.e. it has a motorway and a mainline train station).

So you want to go to University after working for a few years, that's a good thing to do because in that time you've obviously worked up great credit and financial skills which is more than you can say for a lot of 18-entry students (I'm one of them).

It just means employers have convinced the government that they should be able to pay people less.  Look at the starting salary for those positions and compare it to the cost of a degree and the starting salaries:

[A chemical Engineer starts of 28k](http://www.prospects.ac.uk/chemical_engineer_salary.htm).  [For a non graduate it is 16k](http://www.lovemoney.com/news/money-saving-tips-bargains-and-freebies/student-finance/3981/the-best-and-worstpaying-university-degrees).

The Chem Eng misses out on 3 years salary to get the degree and have about 50k of debt (27 for fees and the same for living costs).  So he has to earn 95k more just to break even.  Make sense so far?

He is earning 13k a year more.  But 1/3 of that goes instantly in tax an NI so he only keeps 8.5k.  Based on 3% interest on his debts it will take them 15 years just to break even.

So Chemical Engineers, famously a shortage subject, are no better off than non graduates for at least the first third of there working lives.  And that is assuming they walk straight from university into a string of jobs and that tax rates don't rise etc.

Hardly sounds like a ""skills shortage"" to me.  More like business does not want to have to pay the going rate for engineers when it can import them more cheaply.

This is why we need to separate retail and investment banking, because it allows the banks to keep running the investment side of things the way they were doing while the retail sector is far more tightly regulated. And this actually makes sense as the investment side of banking wasn't where the problems started, it was the retail sector that caused all the issues when it started to treat mortgages as a commodity.

So I do think the public will is there to make the changes required, and reading the financial papers the trade does expect things to go back to Glass-Steagall style regulation, but what we need is clear and realistic leadership on this issue to make it happen.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"The tuition fees and student loans are not really one and the same.

The bottom end of applicants, the first-time applicants with low-income families are certainly better off. Anyone who tried University, found the subject they picked clearly wasn't for them and decided to take time out to pick a course they wanted will have to pay the tuition fees for the first year, which while not everyone was certainly the case for some of the people when I was doing my degree.

I understand the sentiments - if you go to University to doss around, then you don't deserve to go. I suppose I agree with that. The thing is that some people genuinely are lost as to what to do and they will try a course they think looks like it's for them. If it turns out it isn't and they don't want to finish it but would rather try something else, the funding isn't there.

There's also the case of those whose background makes them ineligible for full student support. If they have to pay their tuition fees, I'd certainly find it likely even those with money may be hesitant to commit £27,000 to a degree that may not give them any benefits.

Those at the bottom theoretically are better off, as long as the government sticks to what it has stated. If I remember, there's a clause in the terms stating that any changes the government makes will also be retroactive, so people could be screwed by a government down the line that feels it's 'unfair' how students can wipe debt clean that they opt into of their own accord.

So I am in the top 1% but supply is high enough that I earnt less than a tube train driver? 23k Hardly bank breaking income especially when the SLC lifts the best part of 3k straight from my salary...

The simple truth is that education was government sponsored for generations.  And companies have gotten used to being able to hire people for peanuts who have a small fortune in education.  Now the subsidy is mostly gone employers will have to pay more.  Now the SLC take 11% of my income and I get no tax break on that,  employers will *have* to either *have* pay 18% more or do without.

I'm going to go through this from the least serious to the most, with the best knowledge that I have. I am NOT a lawyer, but I have been though Crown Court, Anti-Terror interviews, I'm a law student, and I have had a whole lot of fun in this area, so take this info as you will. /disclaimer

0) PACE (The Police And Criminal Evidence Act) contains the responsibilities and duties of the police in most cases, as well as a number of your rights. The police have a handbook that I have heard is worth a good read, and is a lot lighter than the law it's self. If you don't want to shell out the £30, see if your local or city library has a copy.

1) Traffic stop

Be polite, courteous and comply as much as possible without putting yourself in danger in any way. Answer in short statements, do not lie, and if worried, ask such things as ""am I legally obliged to answer that?""

Also, don't lie. It'll only shoot you later.

In a traffic stop, it's likely to be somthing minor, and you don't want to get into more trouble than it's worth, so if you assist an officer, you stand a chance of just getting a warning. If you insult, threaten, abuse and irritate the officer, they tend to become more interested in any and all things they can arrest you for. And it's a long list.

2) Stop and Search

The police have limited powers, and it's a case of:

a) be polite.

b) ""am I legally obliged to answer that?"" / ""am I legally obliged to do that?""

c) On what grounds am I being searched? - there are limited grounds for stop and search, and it revolves around either reasonable suspicion of you carrying a weapon or your involvement in terrorism in most cases. A blanket order can be put in an area allowing for wider powers, but it's relatively rare outside central London.

d)  You have the right to request an officer of your gender do the search. It's a bit more complicated with tans people though.

e) No comment is always a good idea for probing questions, or short answers that give nothing away. Don't try to be clever. They have had training and you have not.

f) you DO NOT have to give them your name, address, date of birth or any other identifying information unless they are arresting you.

g) Take down their names, badge numbers, station names etc, and if they do anything that you have issue with (including and down to ""not being polite""), feel free to comment to the local police force and the IPCC.

3) Arrest

a) No Comment is your friend - it can be used against you in court, but a good lawyer on your side will make it noneffective.

b) comply and be polite about it. If you don't, it'll only hurt more, and you could be charged with resisting arrest.

c) if you have a medical condition such as Repetitive Strain Injury, and the handcuffs are painful, tell the officers and ask if they can be loosened. If you have been compliant and polite, the officer will normally do this kind of thing for you, as long as you are not a threat. Don't abuse this kind of thing though.

d) Cage vans have no seatbelts. Coppers will look at you very strangely if you ask to have your seatbelt on in a normal van or car - but they will normally do it up if asked and available. Otherwise, I understand that bracing yourself is a wise thing to do.

e) On entering the police station for 'booking in', it is not wise to mention old, low level, drug use when questioned (as long as it is not current etc). Be polite and compliant.

f) giving a false name etc will just slow them down, and unless you know what you are doing, it's not really worth it (but it can be perfectly legal)

g) Medical information can be important, give it to them! If you have medication, tell them, and if you feel ill, do the same. Request the duty doctor (called the FMI or Forensic Medical Examiner). You cannot have your medication until after you have seen them, so this can be crucial.

f) You have the right to FREE legal advice while in the police station. Use it. DO NOT use the duty solicitor (as they hang around police stations and talk to police all day, they tend to be somewhat slanted against you)

g) The area is rigged with cameras. Be wise to this. This includes sound, and will most likely be targeted at where the phone is that you talk to the solicitor on.

h) if you are, for example, autistic, you have the right to have a 'responsible adult' in any police interviews. Use that right!

i) you have the right to food and water. The food can be vegan etc if requested, although they may be pains about it.

j) you have the right to read the prisoners rights book. I understand that it's dry, but somthing to read if you are bored

k) you have the right to a reasonable amount of sleep without interruption in most circumstances

l) there are time limits on the length of time they can keep you, and you may even get a call from the inspector to make sure you are OK and explain why they are keeping you.

m) An interview means that they do not have enough information to charge you. Keep your mouth shut and ""No Comment"" all the way. If your solicitor says otherwise, that's some what of a warning signal that you need a new solicitor. Like, now.

n) Keep calm in the interview. They want you to react. They are trained to break you. Trained to get a reaction. Keep calm and carry on. Your Zen-like state will only irritate them more.

o) Remember that anything that you write can be read by the police, unless your lawyer says otherwise.

p) A caution means that they don't have enough to charge you with, looks good on their stats and looks bad on your criminal record, and CRB checks later. Think seriously before accepting a caution.

q) Never sign anything bar the starting stuff in the custody suite until your solicitor gets there, such as statements, police pocket books or blank pieces of paper. Look up the Birmingham Six if you want to know why not.

r) Don't lie! It'll only cause problems later.

s) they will try to befreind you to get answers out. They are not on your side. Don't fall into their trap.

true,LadySkywalker,null,null,"I'm just finishing up a one year Msc and I had never studied abroad either. This is what I wish I would have done differently:

1. Pack sweaters and like 3 pairs of jeans. Anything you need to layer you can get cheaply from Primark or Debenhams. 
2. Book a flight that will get you here obscenely early. You're not going to have anything to eat, anything to cook with, and presumably no blankets to sleep under. But everything in Oxford closes at 5-6pm so if you finally step off the bus at 4pm you're basically screwed for the night and will end up sleeping under those sweaters you brought. 
3. Fight the urge to bring books. I know...we're smart people...we read...get a county library card. I have way too many books now and don't know what to do with them.
4. Bring enough money to buy a bike. Lincoln is central but your accommodation and department may not be. Plus bikes are dead useful. Either go to dailyinfo.co.uk or gumtree.com to look for bikes in advance and get an idea of prices.
5. Go to all of your MCR events. I know at first it will seem like a lot but it is the easiest way to get to know people in your college and if Lincoln is like Brasenose there's always free food and drinks so that's a bonus. 
6. If you're a girl only bring one pair of black heels for formal, flipping cobblestone everywhere. 
7. Get yourself a bank account and make sure your money is here before you arrive. 
8. Depending on how much stuff you have, when you get off the bus you have to go straight to college to pick up your room key. If you get off at Queens Lane/High Street (which is next to Lincoln) and don't have a lot of stuff you're fine. If you're bringing waaaay too many bags the only place you'll find a cab is at the last stop, Gloucester Green. 
9. You'll figure out the pubs and clubs as the year goes along but the go to pub is the Kings Arms which is near Lincoln. 
10. The British system of education is different. Make a work plan and stick to it. 
11. Your phone. You can A. unlock your smartphone and bring it with you and buy a pay as you go sim.  B. Suck it up and buy a cheap crap phone for like 10gbp and put it on a pay as you go plan. You won't be able to get a contract for cheap because the cheap ones are all for 2years so decide now your means of contact because you want to have a number to give out to all the people you'll meet at your MCR events. 
12. Check the damn weather for the day you're arriving. I assumed England sucks and it would be cold in October. So I showed up in like 4 layers and a sweater. It was a massive heat wave all week. Just check before you get dressed for your flight and you can try and avoid dying when you get off the bus. 

Edit: PS- Lincoln and Brasenose are friendly rivals..do not expect further help from us. &lt;3 (read: look up the history of Oxford and you'll get all the stupid smart jokes that all the people who have been here way to long make after a few drinks)

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; This is the issue. When there are too few graduates ""at any price"", that is when there is a shortage. As in when you offer the position for a larger salary than a manager gets and no one even applies. Until then there is only a shortage when people are too cheap to pay. 

I think you're assuming that businesses have unlimited funds to bring people on board, or that there's some logic in the idea we could offer graduates £100k salaries and unless that's exhausted, there is no shortage. 

&gt; I have a 1st class degree in physics and 4 As at A level, another classic shortage subject. My first job was for 23k a year. So I am in the top 1% but supply is high enough that I earnt less than a tube train driver? 23k Hardly bank breaking income especially when the SLC lifts the best part of 3k straight from my salary...

Here your problem is entitlement. Also, perhaps you're underestimating the hardships faced by tube train drivers? These are people working monotonous tasks over unsociable hours in unpleasant conditions and who have to deal with the unfortunately high possibility that they will inadvertently kill someone when they throw themselves in front of a train. 

Come at it from another direction and consider that there are plenty of people out there working long hours doing hard work for a lot lot less than your £23k. 

Also, the SLC taking that part of your salary is a choice you made. You decided to go to University and to deal with the debts that follow. That is in fact something all students have to face and for that reason it's little surprise that applications are down this year in the wake of fee rises. 

I'm sorry to say it, but intelligence alone doesn't entitle you to glorious salaries. That's not how the country is set up.

Nor would it all, or even much of it, be lost - necessarily. It does, as you say, depend on how the issue is approached and handled. There's also a deeply entrenched tendency to overstate the importance of the financial sector, as it now operates, to the UK. To a fair degree, the metaphor of thanking the person who broke your legs for bringing (indeed, selling) you crutches is very apt.

While I don't think the tax revenue the finance sector generates will compensate for the bailout costs, it is important to remember that it is an important part of our economy. We can't get away from that, and it is still one of the reasons the UK has the global position it has. If we do use vindictiveness to drive the reform policy and as a result force the sector to abandon the UK, we will be in a worse position. 

&gt; Well, that's a bit misleading, because, as you indicate, it was the commoditisation of mortgage debts that caused the multiplicative effect which really screwed us - derivatives of commodised debt have become an essentially bottomless pit, with no one (even the bankers themselves) quite having a handle on how big the potential for financial destruction actually is. CDOs (Collateralised Debt Obligations) were harmful enough, but it's CDSs (Credit Default Swaps), and the fact that pretty much anyone can bet against anyone else's debts being repaid, which seriously threw the spanner in.

The issue was that it was retail sector doing this with mortgages. Had there been some form of separation then it wouldn't have been possible to take what is a sensible thing when dealing with investments and use it for everything. So this is why the two need to be separated again, so we can put far stronger regulations on the way that retail banking operates without forcing the investment sector to leave. It also means that we can allow investment banks to collapse while keeping the retail sector functioning.

That's not particularly significant, and just returns application levels to those seen for 2010.

Interesting, point 8 on p4 states that 2011 did _not_ see an upswing in applications by 18-year-olds, as you may have expected from A-Level students choosing to not take gap years and instead going to uni ahead of higher fees.

Point 13 (p8), however, does show that applications from 19-year-olds saw a greater decline that for 18-year-olds, which perhaps indicates that many of those who didn't apply last year at age 18 are simply forgoing university entirely.

15:15 : Next up in the witness stand is a lip reading expert. She is deaf so it's taking longer than normal to get her ready

15:30 : First line of lip read text said by AF ""Oi you, shaggin your mates missus"" followed by a word she could not decipher

15:35 : Second line, courtesy of JT ""Yeah I (obsturction).. you fucking black cunt, *slight pause*, then you fucking knobhead.""

15:40 : Another JT line... Fuck off (obstruction) fuck off *pause* eh yeah I (obstruction) you fucking black cunt *pause* you fucking knobhed (obst)

Defence will be aruging the obstructions show not all the words can ever be known and that JT prefaced statements with 'Are you saying I called you...?' or something to that effect. Essentially going back to the base argument which is he was merely repeating things AF said

GCS QC: ""Is lip-reading an exact science or is some guesswork involved?""... ""Guesswork involved to a degree""

GCS QC: Now for my favourite line of the day. GCS QC says to lip-reader that ""Any lip reader who speaks with certainty is by definition a fraud"". Amazing stuff. Burden of proof on the prosecution, how can there not be reasonable doubt when witness admits guesswork is involved. Have at her, son

GCS QC: Says lip reader was aware of case long before she joined case as an expert, media representation may have clouded her judgment as she would have been aware of the majority of people's conclusion before she judged for herself. She says she ""Doesn't read newspapers"" and ""knew of the case but not the racial undertones to investigation""... All together now, give me a break you lying bitch! That's ridiculous. Great line of discrediting by GCS QC. She clearly knew what everyone was thinking before she judged for herself, horseshit witness

16:05 : Sense of trepidation this morning now replaced by disbelief and anger at the incompetence of the CPS, the needless damage to JT's image and the fact that this shit will cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Judge Mathis would have had this case thrown out by 1pm and managed to fit in a bitch slap for the prosecution in the process

16:20 : And we're back, defence was looking at evidence for a while now the CPS is questioning their own witness, the lip reader. She is asked for her opinion on what word was said (behind obstructed view) directly before one of the 'black cunt' bombs. She says ""You"". I say that is straight up conjecture

16:25 : The merry-go-round continues. Apparently the lip reader we just saw (LR1 for short) can hear perfectly well, the second one who is now taking the stand, LR2, is deaf. So the woman who said she had no idea this involved racism had clearly heard all news reports on it for months, as well as anything she read, prior to claiming ignorance on the subtext? Are you having a fucking laugh?!

16:27 : LR2 is talking now. She is deaf, until she reveals otherwise I guess. She is saying there is a ""High degree of inaccuracy in any lip reading"". Nice

16:30 : LR2 is also a prosecution witness. Those Einsteins have put up a witness who opened her testimony by shitting on the credibility of her profession

16:45 : Apparently Doreen Lawrence has now turned up, she is the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. I'm astounded if this is true

Generally when you are stopped driving it will be done under [Section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/163).

Basically a person driving or cycling on a road must stop if required to do so by a police officer or traffic officer (think those [black and yelllow 4x4s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_Agency_Traffic_Officers)).

Once stopped they can request your [driving licence](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/164), your [name and address and insurance details](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/165). It is an offence not to produce these when required. However you can be offered a ""producer"", officially called a HO/RT1 (Home Office Road Traffic form 1), which requires you to produce certain documents at the police station of your choice within 7 days.

That said if the officer is not happy you have insurance or a licence they can conduct further enquiries and possibly arrest[1] you or [seize your vehicle](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/165A) if they have enough evidence. 

If you have committed an offence:

The officer will generally point out the offence and should [caution you](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotHaveToSayAnything). You are not under arrest and it reminds you that anything you say can be given as evidence. **If you say anything without being cautioned it can still be given in evidence** however this is harder for the police to use and less likely to be admitted.

After you have been cautioned you may be questioned about the offence. **You do not have to answer these questions** however remember the officers have a job to do and are humans. They may become angry or agitated by you not answering, especially if you say nothing at all! It is better to say something like, ""I do not wish to answer your questions"". 

If you go down this route you may receive a ticket or be reported to court. A ticket is optional at the officer's discretion and penalties can be higher in court. You need to decide, if you committed the offence, whether it is worth fighting it in court and risking a higher penalty than the ""on the spot"" fine. 

Should you accept the ticket you will generally get 28 days to pay and, if you get points on your licence, you will need to produce your licence for the points to be added within 7 days at a police station.

If you are reported to court, either because you refused the ticket or it wasn't offered, you can be summonsed within 6 months of the offence to appear at a magistrates court to hear the case.

There is a lot of advice about ""don't be a dick"" and ""don't fail the attitude test"". A lot of officers hate traffic, especially traffic paperwork, and would rather give a warning if they thought it would be listened to. Therefore you can appear remorseful and receive just a telling off. Alternatively some officers love sticking everyone on and if you admit it and act remorseful they just have more evidence for court. You take your chances unfortunately, there is no requirement for them to use their discretion.


If they want to search your vehicle:

Searches will generally be done under two parts of legislation.

[Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/1) allows a police officer to stop and search any person or vehicle in public for stolen or prohibited articles(i) and may detain a person or vehicle for the purpose of such a search **if** he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he will find stolen or prohibited articles. 

(i) See the link for details of prohibited articles, sub-section 7.

[Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/section/23)

If an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person is in possession of a controlled drug he may detain and search that person and search any vehicle or vessel.

In both cases certain requirements must be followed by the police. Namely they must tell you the following:

* Grounds for the search (*smell of cannabis*)
* Object of the search (*cannabis*)
* They must produce their warrant card if not in uniform or if requested
* They must state their identity and station they are from
* They must inform you that you're entitled to a copy of the search record
* They must state which legal power they are using (*section 23*)
* They must tell you that you are detained for the search

They can use reasonable force to perform the search if necessary.

If you disagree with the way you are/have been treated the best advice is to note down the police vehicle registration and/or the officer's badge number (usually displayed on their shoulder or chest) and anything else distinctive. It is best not to argue with them at the time, it will not end well and only gets both parties more angry and leads to a worse situation. (Obviously if it is is serious, for example you are being unnecessarily assaulted, then do something, but for a ticket you disagree with or if they are being rude then it is best to wait).

Once the incident is over call your the non-emergency number, 101, and ask to make a complaint. If you are not happy with the way your complaint has been handled you can complain to the [IPCC](http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx).

I hope this has given you an overview of what you wanted. If you have further questions I would be happy to answer them. Unfortunately UK law is a lot more complicated in your rights and requirements than the US constitution and therefore I can't provide a list of your rights specifically.

Also to answer the question that is being debated elsewhere when I indicate for a vehicle to stop I like them to do it in as safe as place as possible. If this means driving for another mile to pull over somewhere safer then go ahead. All I ask is you let me know you have seen me, put your hazards on or indicate towards the kerb, and slow down. Once you have pulled over somewhere safe I prefer people to sit in their cars. This is because it is safer for everyone if you are in your vehicle when I talk to you. The less people out on the road the better. If I come and ask you to step out of the car it is usually because I need to have a longer chat with you and it can be difficult through a car window with my back to the traffic so speaking face to face on the kerb is safer and easier. You do not have to get out the vehicle but, as above, a bit of mutual respect with everyone looking out for each other's safety can go a long way. 

If you want to film once you have been pulled over you have the right to do so. I would ask you let me know but have no power to stop you. Some officers, for some reason, still get confused with this bit of law and may give you a hard time. I would try explaining your rights but, as above, if it becomes agitated and looking towards trouble I would recommend stopping and complaining. Despite what you hear police complaints are dealt with seriously.

[1] Arrest is always an option for police officers with any (give or take) offence. In order for a police officer to make a lawful arrest they must suspect an offence has occurred, suspect that person did it and believe the arrest is [necessary](http://police-wiki.com/IDCOPPLAN). You can technically be arrested for stealing a bag of crisps worth 20p assuming the necessity criteria is met, however generally officers will use their discretion to avoid this where possible.",0,1341844865,null,0,1341846987,0,c5bhcv7,t3_w9kif,t1_c5bhcv7,t3_w9kif,null,1429332136,80,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,80

In addition there is [Section 50 of the Police Reform Act 2002](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/50) which allows officers to require your name and address if they believe someone is acting in an anti-social manner. Again it is an offence to not give these details, or give false details, and you can arrested under Section 24 PACE.

There are other situations when officers can require your name and address as well. Unfortunately it is not clear cut and a generic ""don't tell 'em your name pike!"" can lead to further problems. 

The rest of what you've written is pretty good stuff. Especially in custody.

Added to that - there are quite a few major defense contractors in the UK.

I narrowed it down further to a choice of two, I chose the course that I think specialised to my interests and was closer to the big players in industry. As well as this I was accepted onto their scholarship program and the course was cheaper so it was a win win.

I also looked at the work produced by other students and the different lecturers that I would be learning from to make my final decision. My final choice has great industry links with students often getting internships with company's such as MPC or double negative in London and I feel the experiences I will gain and the contacts I will make will be some of the most powerful tools for getting employment.

Austerity measures are unnecessarily killing our economy: Banks won't lend, people won't spend, people not spending = stagnant demand = no manufacturing = no jobs. It's a downward spiral, a self fulfilling prophecy.   

Austerity measure should be brought in when the economy is doing well, not when it's a sinking ship. It's completely the wrong thing to do. The Tories have this so wrong it's actually a fucking joke. 

In very very simple economic terms ( and this is important ): What I spend is either directly or indirectly what you earn and what you spend is directly or indirectly what I earn. If you have nothing spare to spend, my income suffers and if I have nothing to spend, your income suffers. There's no lack of demand here, we all want shit, the problem is the lack of disposable income. The lack of disposable income is a by-product caused by austerity measures.

true,MoreSpikes,null,null,"Writing student here. It's a very good article bud, keep on typing. Now, you asked for a critique, so I'm going to offer up the best I can give, but just remember that you still wrote a good piece and my opinion is just that.

&gt;No longer is defensive awareness enough; attacking full-backs must be abundantly equipped with an offensive skill set. Overlaps and crosses are now just as important as tackles and interceptions.

The wording of this was a bit tricky. Good idea behind the paragraph, but you could use a slight change in the order of it.

&gt;Perhaps in some alternate universe the Neville brothers are still starting opposite each other for The Three Lions

The change in tone got me here. You start your piece by utilizing an informed voice. You're telling us about the modern fullback, and you're punctual and factual. But then there's this standalone joke. My advice: either go with a lighthearted voice the entire way through, or stick to the informed voice. Either one is good, but pick one and go with it.

&gt;With Stewart Downing being the only true winger in the squad (Aston Villa just chuckled inside), the attacking full-backs will be instrumental in providing some much-needed width. Much like Barcelona, Liverpool will transition into a 3-4-3 going forward, and the converted wingbacks will often be responsible for initiating the attack in the final third. Unlike Barcelona, though, Liverpool doesn’t possess attacking players with the quality of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, David Villa and Alexis Sanchez.

Continuing on my last point, if you embedded a joke higher up in the piece, then your lighthearted tone would work here. For this paragraph, you could expand on the tactical quirks of the 3-4-3. Assume the readers have a constant level of intelligence. You explained the result of the 2002 world cup earlier, so you had to assume then that the reader had a relatively lower level of soccer knowledge. That same reader might not understand the 3-4-3, so you could explain how the system works here.

&gt;With a potential front 3 of Stewart Downing-Andy Carroll-Luis Suarez

Only use a player's full name when you introduce them. After that, you can switch to their last name for a professional reference or first name for a personal reference. Chose between those two depending on what suits your purpose.

No quote, but sidenote: loving the statistics. Your informed voice works better for you.

&gt; Jose Enrique was signed last summer and immediately looked up to the task.

Watch out for the passive...

&gt; His Spanish technical ability is obviously outstanding, but he seems to lack the conviction present in other Spanish superstars.

...and using the same qualifiers twice in one sentence.

&gt; The double pivot of Lucas and Steven Gerrard will be essential to the attacking full-backs’ success.

Honest question, because I haven't really looked at Rodgers' 3-4-3. Does his system use a double pivot?

&gt; Full-backs will play a massive role in Rodgers’ scheme and Glen Johnson and Jose Enrique will surely be opposite each other come August 18. Their roles will likely change, but fans should be pleasantly surprised with their improvements

The conclusion is your chance to really nail home your point. You could elaborate more here.

My real point is, as a state, we can quite comfortably afford to send every school leaver to university for free; austerity was a red herring to cut university teaching funding by 80% and move toward ""market led"" principles.

In case you didn't realise, I'm against the current plans for reform, and really reform on a whole (at the moment); especially in the current economic situation, along with the fact they want to limit the time that can be spent on the reform debate (a constitutional one too, [why limit to 10 days?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18759639)) (currently video of the live debate going on at the moment which can be viewed in my last link)

Edit: Also one of the main point is that if both houses are elected, who is more legitimate? The House of Lords currently normally give way as the Commons are elected by the people, very rarely do they stop bills completely (and if they do, the Commons can just bypass them). If they're both elected, then the House of Commons can't bypass the Lords realistically.

1) Unless you are being arrested or searched the police officer does not really need you out the car. They have no legal power to force you out the car alone. They may have the power to remove you if something else is happening however, for example being arrested. 

2) i would be polite, explain why you think you did not commit an offence and go from there. The officer may believe you or not and may issue a ticket or not. Others may say don't say anything and challenge it in court. You can do that but you may be able to avoid court altogether. It's your own decision really, do you speak when you don't have to in order to try and avoid the hassle of court? Either way be polite and take the officers details.

Starting not catchy. First two paragraphs almost pure fluff. It would have been a lot better to start with the two Brazilians. 

&gt;In the 2002 World Cup, the pair of Roberto Carlos and Cafu took the world by storm. Not only defensively sound, their attacking prowess, offensive overlaps and deep crosses helped Brazil capture a world record 5th world title. The attacking full-back was born, and it would change the position forever. 

Something like the quote above. Or something. 

Also, either cut the cliched lines, or make them mean something.

Doesn't mean anything. In fact, that whole paragraph is a little bit of a mystery. 

&gt;Possession is the name of the game though, and the Liverpool full-backs need to become disciplined in this regard. **Losing the ball too high up the pitch will leave the side vulnerable to quick and effective counter attacks.**

Ya'think? Decide if you're writing for a newcomer to football or someone who is more knowledgeable. Having a 'DUH' line here along with insightful statistics later tells me you don't know who you're writing for. 

Most importantly, what's the purpose of the article? Introducing the role of the full-back? Introducing our two full-backs? Analysing their performance over the last season? I have absolutely no idea. You start off with a brief history of attacking fullbacks, go into how we might use fullbacks, criticize Johnson followed by Enrique, and yet end by saying fans will be surprised with their improvements without saying how they have or might have improved.

The march was proposed to deliberately cause the maximum offence and distress to underline a political point.

Allowing the march to proceed would not only have offended and distressed many reasonable people but also risked public disorder and violence. Therefore the march was correctly banned.

You are also right on the identity issues. Like I said, this is my first ever sports article and it's something I will have to work out. 

The possession paragraph was about Rodgers philosophy. You're right in that I didn't identify that well enough, but once again, stuff like that I relate to inexperience. I'm a philosophy major, not a journalist, so my writing knowledge is pretty limited. I'm learning as I go.

The point of the article was to talk about attacking full-backs and how ours need to improve to fit into Rodgers' scheme. Which I think I did.

For some reason we have gotten this idea that bringing democracy to things is a universally good idea, regardless of circumstance. We have an elected chamber, the House of Commons - filled by our MPs who for the majority of the time, align with the party Whip rather than their constituents. What would be the purpose in duplicating this chamber (and the problems associated with it) in another chamber?
Also, if we are voting them in, who is going to care enough to actually vote for them? We already have a substantial apathy problem, why rely more on a failing system?

If the purpose of a second chamber is to be a check on the first, then why not fill it with people with expertise in many different fields who are capable of exercising this role without financial courting, or political pressure. The commons has many career politicians with no real world experience. How effective would such people be at scrutinising legislation?

All I can see an elected chamber accomplishing is creating more of the issues we experience with the Commons already. I am not saying the Lords doesn't need reform... it clearly does. The Administration should not be able to flood the Lords, or appoint who goes into it. There should also be required levels of attendance, etc, to justify their wage.

The cop riding shotgun was kinda cocky about me setting off the camera (even though there was no way it actually got my car - it was facing the other way), and said ""that's a fine and points on your license that"". They asked for my license and I was still kinda shocked about what had happened so I just stood there silently while the driver of the police car called out my license and the registration of my car, then they just let me go. I don't actually understand what happened that night though, because I haven't had any letters about a fine; I think they were just trying to scare me.

He only disappears from Gwen's sight for a 10-20 seconds, which would imply that the TARDIS landed inside the Torchwood hub.

But then at the beginning of Utopia, you see Jack running towards the TARDIS that lands *outside*... meaning he would have had to take the ""elevator"" thing under the waterfall sculpture and Gwen would definitely have seen him, since that thing takes a minute or so to raise itself to the ground level outside.

Anyway, I think it's a minor consistency.  Hardly noticeable unless you actually watch those two episodes back to back.

&gt; (b) a candidate on such a list (a “party candidate”), or

&gt; (c) a candidate who is not on such a list (an “independent candidate”).

&gt; Allocation of seats to parties or independent candidates

&gt; 4 (1) The allocation of seats in an electoral district to parties and independent candidates is to be undertaken in the following way.

&gt; (2) The first seat is to be allocated to the party or the independent candidate with the largest number of votes.

&gt; (3) The second and subsequent seats are to be allocated in the same way, except that the number of votes given for a party to which one or more seats have already been allocated is to be divided by the number of seats already

Once their allocation is accounted for, it goes to season ticket holders next. The balancing act is that bigger away games have a bigger allocation (though still tiny relatively) but more subscribers, low grade away games are generally at smaller stadia with an even smaller Chelsea allocation. You may be able to get a ticket as a member, don't think they go to 1+2 unless they are really desperate like Liverpool away, 2nd last game of last season when everyone knew we were playing the B team and couldn't give a shit, those tickets even went on General Sale!

First, look at the entire rebranding of the club. It's all been based on a ""retro"" style and an image of the club returning to it's roots. The liverbird, the classic style of the home kit, the gear in the club shop. All of that was developed *months* before Rodgers was even hired. These changes are clearly an extension of that.

Second, the club just spent *millions* hiring a marketing firm to lead the rebranding. While I am sure that Rodgers has a valued opinion, he is in the football business, not the marketing business. 

Finally, we just appointed a new marketing director, Billy Hogan, who developed the Boston Red Sox brand and negotiated the signing of LeBron James. He's a supremely valuable asset to FSG and they wouldn't put him in that job if Brendan Rodgers was calling the shots on how signs should look and what colour the nets should be.

What you guys are missing is that all of this is a *good* thing.

This may sound harsh but I'd rather have RvP in and let Torres know he will be the main man as soon as he can match that standard, rather than appease him and find he is still misfiring next season. It's almost impossible to correct it in January so all the pressure on Torres may just lead to the same confidence collapse he had in his early months at Chelsea

The use of “unexplained” and “not determined” in the cases of suicide in the UK ( as stated by corners courts) is something that I worry is masking the true extent of how many people are now faced with this being the best choice. Within western culture suicide is rarely a public event and I consider it a problem that this only made the local paper as it stopped traffic (and only will ever make the local paper), how many such event are happening? Suicide in the UK may now be the leading cause of death for males aged 15-24  and the body I saw today looked male and early 20s.

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"From watching the debate on BBC Parliament, many MPs are against reform in the current proposals, and I actually agree with them.

Many MPs have said that the current bill in its form is terrible, rushed, most likely won't get enough time and is not right in refusing to give the public an option for a referendum. Many were also in favour of reform, just not making it elected, or at least not giving it to a public referendum, along with saying that just because you can vote for them, doesn't make the whole system democratic. The main house, the House of Commons are ones that are responsible for their actions, whereas the Lords, if under 15 year terms, they're not going to be held accountable for their actions (can't remember what else was said in the debate), plus, they're also getting job security at 15 years, how many people can have any type of job security today?

There was also the issue that legislation can slow down/stagnate between the two houses, as if they're both elected and the Lords say no, but the Commons want yes, how can they bypass the Lords if they're representing their constituents? Also, another MP reported that in Ireland, the people were sick and tired of the candidates for the two houses campaigning against each other in the constituencies.

They were also saying that it's simply not on peoples agenda as there's the economic crisis, however many were in favour for [David Steele's ideas for reform a few years ago](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/feb/05/comment.lords) makes much more sense to me, it was to:

* Create a statutory appointments commission to choose the independent crossbench peers, and to approve those proposed by party leaders - thus avoiding any future cash-for-peerages scandal
* end the ludicrous byelections for hereditary peers and thereby transform the existing 92 hereditaries into life peers
* introduce a retirement incentive, encouraging those over, say, 75 to leave and make way for fresh appointments. There are some 740 peers, half of whom are not regular attenders, and our average age is far too high at 68

Steele also said that:
&gt;The House of Lords exists for two valuable functions: it scrutinises legislation (other than finance bills) and it holds debates of quality born of its expert composition, sometimes on topics for which the Commons has no time. It no longer obstructs government legislation; it merely has the useful power to ask the Commons to think again. An elected chamber will not be satisfied with that - it will, in time, seek to flex its democratic muscle.

Which to me, also makes sense. If the House of Lords was elected, they can easily challenge the primacy of the House of Commons (as they're the elected house, currently). The House of Lords, as Steele also said, cannot block legislation from the House of Commons, and if required, the Commons can use the Parliament Act to bypass the Lords altogether and get it sent straight to Royal Assent.

As Helen Goodwin [Labour] said, the role of ""The House of Lords should complement it [the Commons] and not duplicate it"", which it seems like the coalition plan on from looking at the current form of the bill.

[Going back to a previous post I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/tengv/my_humble_house_of_lords_reform_proposal/c4m00hf?context=3), here's further points I made against Lords reform.
&gt;1. The House of Lords as it stands contains people from broad range of backgrounds (Earl of Selborne, Lord Attenborough). Those in the House of Commons are normally only career politicians who say they represent the public yet even they are public school educated and have a wealth larger than the average person...so how do they represent us?
&gt;
1. Back to the point about them becoming elected, people would be unlikely to vote for someone who has a wealth of expertise compared to someone who does well on telling the public what they want to hear. People look at the persons character rather than what they intend to do. At the 2010 general election, people would've been unlikely to vote for a Labour MP from what the government as a whole brought the country into, even if their local MP was labour at the time and did his job well. 
&gt;
1. Look at the benefits cap earlier this year, the government wanted to include child benefit in the limit, yet the [House of Lords said that it should be excluded](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16675314). I don't know how it's gone down recently, whether the House of Commons bypassed the House of Lords and disregarded their decision, as it says could be done in the article.
&gt;&gt;He said child benefit was ""a universal benefit"" and it was ""wrong to see it as being a welfare benefit"".
&gt;&gt;
""It's a benefit which is there for all children, for the bringing up of all children and to say that the only people who cannot have child benefit are those whose welfare benefits have been capped seems to me to be a quite extraordinary argument.""
1.  Another example would be the previous government in the House of Lords tried to limit the right to a trial by a jury, which the House of Lords defended for us.

I get your points about buying experience, but a mid-20 striker might have more use for us considering the age gap between Torres and Sturridge/the rest of our strikers.

Falcao will be huge money based on his season and what they paid for him, can't see that ever happening

I can't see us buying Walcott since not only would they not want to sell to us but he's after £100k a week at Arsenal, lord knows what he'd want from us, though technically it could happen. The only scenario I would be truly disappointed in would be a failure to secure Hulk, Cavani or RvP. Based on the parameters of ability, age and records, I can't think of anyone but Cavani, Falcao and possibly Higuain that is realistic. None of them have the commercial appeal of RvP or the history of consistent Premiership goals, though all are considerably younger

I'd take a RvP/Moses double swoop as my first choice, a Cavani move as second choice leaving the Hulk in third. Not that I don't rate Hulk, it's just Cavani's workrate, physique and all round game are closer to Drogba's plus he is specialised in his position. I just want to look at that team sheet and identify a 20 goal a season man, like Hasselbaink and Drogba. Having a couple too many players is less of a concern to me than not having enough when times get tough, Torres has a dodgy injury record too and him out would leave Sturridge and Lukaku only, pretty disconcerting

I think this sums up the problem quite nicely. we all want shit, but we don't have the money for it. 

we think that (even though we don't want the money for it) we should still be able to buy it; so we want the government to give us the money for it (directly or indirectly) so we can buy the stuff we want, but don't have the money for. Once we have the money from the government, we can spend it on the things we want, thus allowing others to buy the things they want, all of which nobody could really afford if it wasn't for the government handing out money in the first instance. 

I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like a good long term solution. short term, maybe it would help. but then you still have to deal with the issue; government and banks and people are spending more than they have.

Although you think you're being very progressive, your post is unfortunately illustrative of a particular kind of snobbery, where people who work with a different cast of mind are not valued. 

Go through all of the jobs in society, and what sort of training is required to excel? Academic training, or actual vocational training for the job at hand? To take a relevant example, to be a software engineer, is it better to study English Literature, History or even an academic course in Computer Science, or to learn the skills which actually make you employable and useful?

The only other teams that I am either neutral or root for unless they are matched with Tottenham Hotspur are Everton and the Wolves. Not sure if that is allowed, but would love some clarification. 



All in all, I'm going to have plenty of questions especially based on the ManU friends of mine and what they feed me that I miss off of the THFC Twitter (they've been raised in the EPL whereas I've been raised with American Football and NBA). Also I may call the sport soccer, but I'm an American and have grown up with that word so you will have to forgive me if I make a mistake from time to time.



Are there specific websites other than the main homepage and/or twitter that I should follow for news? I shortly learned of ESPNFC but any blogs or other sources would be awesome!


Also I'm unfamiliar with the football traditions in terms of ""gear"" (jerseys, hats, scarves, etc).

true,ffhfhffh,null,null,"&gt; Many MPs have said that the current bill in its form is terrible, rushed, most likely won't get enough time

Well the programme motion is likely to be voted against, in which case parliament will be debating this for a few months at least. It's hard to argue that after 100 years of debating different options, followed by a decade of commons vote on the exact proportion of elected and appointed members, followed by a year long consultation to bring forward specific proposals for a bill, followed by a few months of debate in the commons and lords on the exact content of the bill, that ""more time"" is really going to help much. I can't think of a single issue that has been less ""rushed"" than this one.

&gt; not right in refusing to give the public an option for a referendum

I don't really think it's necessary, but Clegg is starting to show signs of cracking on this. Most likely, the bill will include provisions so that if parliament wishes, after 2015 they can vote to call a referendum if the first 1/3 of elected peers doesn't seem to be working out. Presumably then if the referendum votes against, those first 120 elected peers will be kicked out and will be replaced by new appointments by the prime minister, and we'll go back to the old system.

&gt; under 15 year terms, they're not going to be held accountable for their actions

Agreed - the new peers will get 15 years to exercise their own judgement, free from the influence of those who elected them, but crucially also from the party whips. This isn't any worse than the current system - currently peers get a *lifetime* free reign with no accountability to anyone - at least under the proposals it will only be 15 years. 

I would also support a ""right to recall"", similarly to what has been proposed in the commons. So a sufficient petition from the public could remove a member before their term was up if they were guilty of serious wrongdoing.

There will also be an accountability improvement due to the fact that the public get an effective veto over each member through their vote. They can cast their vote based on the candidate's previous record outside politics.

&gt; how many people can have any type of job security today?

The current 800 lords, who get job security for life. There is no proposed changes to the £300 per day allowance, but the reduction to only 450 members more than offsets the costs of elections.

&gt;  however many were in favour for David Steele's ideas for reform a few years ago

If I remember correctly, Steel sought to propose a number of simple, minor, uncontroversial changes he though everyone would support. [They ended up being even more unpopular](http://www.libdemvoice.org/the-failure-of-david-steels-lords-reform-measure-is-good-news-27079.html), as the current opponents of reform still opposed them (there are a shocking amount of MPs and peers who are even opposed to removing the hereditaries), and the current proponents of reform opposed them on the grounds that it would stall any more meaningful reform in future.

&gt; If the House of Lords was elected, they can easily challenge the primacy of the House of Commons

I would actually be very relaxed about that happening to be honest. Having said that, I don't think it will. The power of the elected lords will stay broadly the same, for a few reasons:

- Despite being elected, they are elected by thirds every 5 years. This puts the composition of the House up to 15 years out of date - hardly a claim to greater democratic legitimacy than the commons.

- The reform bill explicitly codifies the relationship between the houses, and state that the role of the Lords should not change. So it will explicitly be written in law that the Lords should not have the power to challenge the primacy of the commons.

- The parliament act is very clear in what the Lords can do - this bill doesn't change that at all. It specifies how long the lords can delay a bill before it becomes law regardless. The fact that Lords are elected doesn't change the fact that it is explicitly written in law that they cannot amend or delay finance bills, and that they can only delay other bills for up to a year.

It's also worth noting that *any* change to the composition of the lords raises this fear that the balance of power might shift one way or another. For a 100% appointed expert lords, many would argue that it would reduce their power to effectively scrutinise legislation as they would be less inclined to act in a coordinated fashion to delay the progress of a bill.

&gt; As Helen Goodwin [Labour] said, the role of ""The House of Lords should complement it [the Commons] and not duplicate it"", which it seems like the coalition plan on from looking at the current form of the bill.

There are so many ways that the proposed elections will result in a very different chamber to the commons. PR, long single terms, 20% experts - to name a few. The current Lords is effectively appointed by the three most powerful MPs - the party leaders. I would argue that this has resulted in the Lords being more of a mirror image of the Commons (i.e. made up largely of ex-MPs) than it would be if the general public were given the opportunity to decide who will be in it.

For example, I will be using my vote for the Lords very differently to my vote for the Commons. My commons vote is essentially restricted to one of the two main parties in my area. I can use my Lords vote to vote for a smaller party I support - like the Pirates, Greens or UKIP, I can vote for specific candidates from within those parties that I especially like, or I can vote for an independent expert, to raise the number of independent experts above the 20% threshold. For me, that is an exciting level or true democracy, that acts as a nice counter-balance to the FPTP system in the Commons that is needed so a party can form a majority government.

&gt; The House of Lords as it stands contains people from broad range of backgrounds (Earl of Selborne, Lord Attenborough).

As it stands, the Lords: -

- has 600 party political appointees, with less than 90 active crossbenchers. [The current Lords are actually more loyal to party whips than MPs](http://unlockdemocracy.org.uk/blog/entry/house-of-lords-a-more-independent-chamber), purely because they have been chosen by the party leaders for that very reason.

- Is 78% male, 22% female

- Has over 50% of its members from London. The north is particularly poorly represented. A PR system would ensure proper representation from all areas of the UK.

While this won't change in legal terms with an elected Lords, I feel that public opinion will look less favourably on governments that ignore an elected Lords. So the reforms will give them more ""soft power"" to ammend and improve legislation.

&gt; Certainly, I think there needs to be a way to remove those who are not pulling their weight; maybe they could be kicked out by a vote from their peers (the other Lords) if they are not seen to be working often enough.

The proposals suggest a £300 daily allowance that is only paid on days where the elected peer actually turns up and participates in debates and votes. I also think it would be good to have some sort of ""right to recall"", where a sufficient public petition will trigger a sort of tribunal where other peers will decide if the peer in question is guilty of some wrongdoing. This helps get rid of bad peers before their 15 year term is up.",0,1341873923,null,0,false,0,c5bp0yv,t3_w9ygv,t1_c5bp0yv,t1_c5boocs,null,1429335828,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Falcao has gone up in my estimation this past year, but the price would be astronomical, unless Athletico's financial situation is worse than they make out (they still owe Porto around €25-30m for the Falcao transfer I believe) but who knows with Spanish clubs, the financial data is always impossible to accurately obtain

Cavani has a pretty ridiculous 66 in 94 for Napoli over the past 2 years, in a league I would consider the most difficult to score in out of all European league. Very impressive stats. Whether Napoli will sell both Lavezzi and Cavani in the same window is up for debate, the money would need to be great since PSG paid a large amount for Lavezzi already

Regarding RvP's potential future decline, I think he matured in to his best season this year and has another 2 years at this level at least. His game is less about pace and acceleration now and more about his impeccable technique and ruthless efficiency in front of goal. I can only imagine what he'd do with all the chances Hazard and Mata would be feeding him. Henry relied much more on skinning the defender before slotting home, RvP has the hold up play in his arsenal (no pun intended) so I think he's much more protected against ageing legs. Also his lack of game time may have inadvertently prolonged his career

The Hutch is an interesting one. Medically speaking there's nothing stopping him playing for 10 years with no further injuries, it's just the ones he's had have increased the likelihood of a future injury of the same nature. He can go out and play 90 mins constantly, though if he were to injure himself we would be looking at a long term recovery. He must stay with us though to continue his rehab. A realistic aim for him this season would be 10 appearances for the first team

Secondly, the trans-gender community. Most of them change their name through deed poll, but it is entirely possible and functionally the same to do it without going through deed poll, going through your banks, service providers etc to change everything.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"I'm not talking about government hand outs, I'm talking being able to earn a decent enough living to be able to afford some of the things you want i.e. a comfortable living with a little disposable income.  

Austerity measures are getting in the way of this big time. 

Also spending more than you have (debt) keeps an economy healthy as wealth borrowed = wealth spent = more jobs. An economy where everyone just about lives within their means is a weak one, no one spends. You don't spend, you don't create anything. 

Look at it like this: I have enough money to have bought a house as I'm getting paid well for the job I do, I also have enough equity and the banks are lending to borrow against it to say build an extension; that extension requires builders, those builders requires material, that material comes from a building trade, that building trade is a lot of jobs and also a lot of future jobs because a happy building trade has money to be able to train apprentices. Also more jobs = less unemployed = less spending on welfare. 

Austerity measures filter back down to the everyday man and his income, so with less disposable income and the inability to borrow money he won't build that extension. No extension = no builder = no need for materials = a reduced building trade = reduced jobs and no apprenticeships because there's no lack of builders fighting over the little work that's out there. Little work = unemployment = a larger spend on welfare so the deficit grows, it doesn't reduce. 

You can apply that theory to all aspects of everyday life. People stop spending money because of a stagnant economy and that leads to recession and eventually depression as we are starting to see now because we're not creating anything.  

Therefore the austerity measures only add to this situation and as far as our outlook at present goes, they are completely the wrong thing to do. It's economical suicide and what the Tories are doing is even worse as they're not only cutting the jobs, they're cutting the welfare too. Double bubble.

 #9 is the centre forward (CF), sometimes referred to as the strike/lone striker or forward, #10 is the central attacking midfielder (CAM), and is said to be playing ""in the hole"" as he occupies the space between the centre forward, the central midfielders (#8 and #4), as well as the wingers/inside forwards or left and right attacking midfielders even (#11 and #7). One of the central midfielders in this formation might be more defensive (CDM, central defensive midfielder).

To be complete, #3 and #2 are full/side backs, #5 and #6 are centrebacks (sometimes one might be called a sweeper and the other a stopper, depending on their play styles), and #1 is a goalkeeper.

Under Carlo he made a number of appearances as a substitute in the premiership and the Champions League, (and eventually making starts in both competitions as well), and was reasonably impressive on all occasions. No jaw-dropping match winning moments, but no shocking mistakes either and usually he performed calmly and intelligently while in possession, showing good composure and vision, and he gave the ball away infrequently.

I like the idea of keeping him with the squad and letting him benefit from training with the senior players while bedding in on the field as a substitute, but the opportunity for growth that would come possibly becoming a starter for another club on loan are undeniable as well. I can see the positives to both. The one thing I worry about is the chance of some sort of repeat of his spell at Swansea. If he's not going to get minutes, even as a sub, at his loan club I'd just as soon have him training with the Chelsea senior pros and getting minutes as a sub for us.

I agree Carroll was very lazy at times last season, and at other times his role in the team was incoherent to how we played. It's frustrating because when he's on top of his game, as he was towards the end of the season, he's damn menacing for *any* team; but reaching that 'top of his game' seems to require a lot, almost as if he's high maintenance.

In reply to your other post about how we've done against weak teams, I know - but we should still be expecting to beat them. That's not intended as arrogance, it's just about realism and having a certain standard of expectation. It wasn't good enough when we lost to those sides, and it won't be good enough if we lose to whichever Romanian first division side we play in the Europa 3rd round qualifier, irrespective of whether we use Suarez (or Gerrard, who I'd also like to see spared)

AVB's a good choice for Spurs - his knowledge of Portuguese players and recent scouting in South America, both areas where quality players can be signed on relatively low wages, will allow him to build a quality side despite Spurs' (now improved) wage structure.

My theory is that they will state that the limit was artificially imposed by the Time Lords for  some reason, and since they are gone it no longer applies.

He came into his own by Series 3 and developed into something great. By the end of his miniseries I was sad he left. He developed into something I loved.

 Enter 11. He was quarky and zainy, similar to 10 but different all the same. The trickster and fairy godmother instead of Time Lord Victorious and instead of a tired soldier mourning for his people. Over time he came into himself, but over time I learned to despise him. I have been very vocal during the most reason series but I hate 11 and I think he is a deplorable incarnation.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"~6m is nice, but there are also reports that we're going to give him a ~4m signing bonus and break our wage ceiling to pay for him. So that's ~10m up front and probably ~100k a week for 3 years. 

So over the entire course of the contract, assuming we keep him for all 3 seasons, it's probably in the 24-30m range spent on one player. 

It's a very tough scenario, to be honest. I don't know how comfortable I am breaking our wage cap for a player who has basically said Harry gave him the confidence to perform. Adebayor seems like the type of player who really needs that arm around his shoulder to tell him what a fucking god he can be if he works his ass off. This is a player with a history of lighting it up for a year and then getting complacent when he has a long-term deal. 

That said, he was fucking immense for us last season and he's probably in the highest tier of strikers that we are capable of signing. We're not getting Falcao or Cavani or something silly like that, so Adebayor could very well be worth the risk. 

People talk about Ade as if he's 35 when he's actually just 28. Signing a very good striker for the prime of his career (28-31) for ~10m sounds like good business to me.

We're going to need to get lucky on an unknown or a young talent if we're going to snag that 20+ goals per season striker, IMO. We just don't have the resources to sign an established world class goalscorer. Adebayor is honestly our most realistic bet if we're talking about experienced players who have proven themselves at top clubs.

Besides, Zlatan's probably not the best or most professional role model for Andy.

As for Carroll's role under Rodgers - it'll be interesting to see what he does with him. The number one thing Rodgers needs from his striker is intelligent, unselfish movement - which is probably the number one flaw in Carroll's game last season, even more than his work with the ball at his feet.

Who wants to come to Liverpool for a guaranteed place on the bench?

Zlatan is what he is because he has immaculate ball control. He was juggling oranges and bubblegum while Carroll was juggling a beer in each hand and a bird on each arm. Do you think Carroll going on loan to Milan for a year is going to help him emulate one of the most technically gifted players of the generation? 

Carroll is a 35 million pound bugbear for Liverpool and the best thing he can do for the club and his own career is to stay at Liverpool and work his butt off and improve his mobility and try to be the best player he can be. Unless there is some ridiculous inflation in football prices or he scores 10 goals in the next World Cup, he is never going to see a higher transfer fee than what he came here for, which means he will always be judged for the 35 million price tag. Even if he moves to Milan for 25 million pounds in a few years time, he will be looked on as a failure because Liverpool would have taken a 10 million loss.

1. He has the coveted homegrown status. Being a youth product of Chelsea since 15, Borini counts as a homegrown player. 

2. He will not take up a senior squad place for the next 2 years. He is 21 years old, but his birthday is in March, which means he will be considered U21 for this season and the next. 

3. One of the biggest fears when buying players from abroad is whether they will be able to adapt to the pace and physicality of the English game, and also whether they will settle. Being a Chelsea youth product and having played for Swansea in the Championship means none of these worries will materialise into problems. 

4. He was called up to the EURO 2012 Italian squad, and even though he didn't play, was one of only 2 21-year old players in the squad. With 1 cap already to his name, he is one of the future stars of Italy. 

5. His goal celebration is incredibly stupid. He puts his hand in his mouth, and it is supposed to signify having a knife between your teeth, which is some Italian saying for wanting something so much that it hurts. Something like that.

Suarez is very likely to be played also as an inside forward next season, as that is his preferred position both in Ajax and in the Uruguay national team. He can play center forward, but it is unlikely. 

That leaves 1 center forward for Liverpool. 

Now let's say we get either Borini or Dempsey. We might get both, but let's assume safely that we are getting 1 more striker. We'll call him Dempini for now. 

With Dempini and Carroll, we will have 2 center forwards. 

You want to send 1 of them on loan. 

Leaving us with 1 center forward who is a new recruit to the club. 

In the case of injury/suspension/fatigue, we will have no suitable replacement for this position. 

In the case where we need to change the style of play, as Carroll's style of play is very different from Dempini's, we will have no alternative option to this position.

Have you watched all of series 1-4? Bad Wolf made sense. It was subtle and not focused on until the end, but I liked that. It wasn't in your face and they didn't have to do a close-up on it every episode. The same with the bees in series 4. We still have no real idea WHY the TARDIS decided to explode. But that's not important because the TARDIS is exploding. Why didn't Amy or Rory want to rescue their kidnapped child? Not important because she's River Song. Ever since Moffat took the lead, it had seemed to me like the writers have been running around with their hands in the air trying to throw together something bigger and flashier and more dangerous than last week, constantly upping the stakes regardless of whether or not it makes any sense at all.

Sorry for the long message but i really think it's important for people to understand the inverted winger process ( or at least how i'm interpreting it). I am in no way an expert, this is opinion with a bit of knowledge, nothing more :p

In a 433, if you want the wing backs to overlap, then you want inverted wingers because it allows the winger to cut in and become a pivot point, at that point guys like Ashley Cole make runs around the outside, and your number 9/8/10, make runs between the opposing wing back and centre back. 
Having someone cutting in on to their preferred foot is better because it allows them the third option of shooting if the opposing wing back is forced one way or another.

It depends on how we choose to attack because if we do so asymmetrically ( we've generally favored the Left wing at Chelsea IMO), then you only want an inverted winger on the right, but the left wing it doesn't really matter as much because the ball comes in from the left and the right winger becomes a second striker in the box ( which is how Sturridge scored most of his goals last season). 

tl dr: asymmetric attacking = 1 inverted winger, standard 433 = two inverted wingers because it gives the winger another option.

He also did little to produce goals himself - he was heavily reliant on good service from the rest of the team; really great finishers tend to be able to pull a few of their own making out of the bag.

Check out this [comparison of PL strikers from 2011/12](http://www.eplindex.com/14273/best-premier-league-striker-opta-stats-analysis.html); Adebayor was given vastly more Clear-Cut Chances than any other striker but RVP, but has one of the lowest CCC Conversion percentages. Also look at the most telling stat: 100% of Adebayor's goals came from CCCs, i.e. chances put on a plate for him by other players.

Any defender require strong tackling and patience.

A centre back will require good positioning and intuition for when the proper time to tackle is. You'll notice most centre backs don't become truly great until their late 20s, experience is key in this position. They have to be strong in the air, and bigger than a fullback. Have to play the position with a partner, and ensure they're on the same page and understand each other and what each other will do in specific situations. Need to be organized and able to organize those around you.

A fullback will require good pace, good passing/crossing as most get forward quite often, and good tactical sense for when to move up the pitch and when to check their run. Don't need to defend quite as strong as a CB nor be as good in the air. Do need the usual strong positioning and will be asked to cover the counterattack somewhat often (CBs often push forward for corners with the fullbacks staying back).",0,1341895619,null,0,false,0,c5bu82h,t3_walsw,t1_c5bu82h,t1_c5bu3k9,null,1429338341,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"&gt;The current 800 lords, who get job security for life. There is no proposed changes to the £300 per day allowance, but the reduction to only 450 members more than offsets the costs of elections.

Whilst I know the members of the Lords can sit in there for the rest of their life, I was talking about in regards to the reform, reducing it to 15 year terms is still a long time for a peer to sit without worry. 

&gt;however many were in favour for David Steele's ideas for reform a few years ago

I think my wording for that was a bit off, what I was meaning to say was that the MPs in the debate yesterday, quite a few seemed to support David Steele's proposals for reform that were put forward a few years ago (I think what I wrote said that loads of them were in favour for it years ago). I would also say that the website you linked to is biased, it's one supporting the Liberal Democrats who oppose, or currently oppose them anyway?

&gt;The parliament act is very clear in what the Lords can do - this bill doesn't change that at all. It specifies how long the lords can delay a bill before it becomes law regardless. The fact that Lords are elected doesn't change the fact that it is explicitly written in law that they cannot amend or delay finance bills, and that they can only delay other bills for up to a year.

Sure there is the Parliament Act, but if you vote for a peer to voice your concern in Parliament, and then their decision gets overridden by the House of Commons, that's not exactly right is it? They should have just as much legitimacy as the House of Commons, they'll be elected by the people. Assuming the reforms go through in their current form, which I don't think they should, the Parliament Act regarding the option for the Commons to bypass the Lords, that would've been made in a time when the Lords were unelected, supposedly 'undemocratic', however if they're now 'democratic', then shouldn't they honestly have as much legitimacy as the Commons if they're who the electorate want? I don't see how it can't not happen.

Regarding this.
&gt;The current Lords are actually more loyal to party whips than MPs, purely because they have been chosen by the party leaders for that very reason.

Didn't that start from Blair's reforms in 1999?

[Look at this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13137835). Membership at almost 800, and whose fault is that? The Prime Minister's for making too many life peers, and wants to [create a further 172 \(MP said it in debate last night, only article is from the Metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/826487-con-lib-coalition-deal-to-create-172-peers)).

Whilst Blair's reforms did [reduce the numbers down from 1,330 in October 1999 to 669 in March 2000](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbrief/10402.htm), with the ability for the PM to grant life peerages, it's not exactly helping the amount of members in the House of Lords.

(BBC Article I posted above)
&gt;The report said the arrival of so many new peers in such a short space of time had had a ""negative impact"" upon the culture of the upper chamber.
&gt;
""In the past, members of the House of Lords have been added only gradually, and become socialised in the chamber's practices and conventions,"" it noted.
&gt;
""Most obviously, the chamber is known for having a non-partisan ethos, and a courteous atmosphere.
&gt;
""It has been widely noted - in the media as well as within Parliament itself - that the influx of a large number of new members, including many former MPs, has resulted in changed behaviour.
&gt;
""The House of Lords' effective functioning has already been compromised by the recent rapid rise in membership, in ways which are damaging its effectiveness. Any further increase in size could fundamentally undermine the chamber's ability to do its job.""

true,SinnerTakesAll,US,usa,"The problem is there's no real consensus on this because positional numbering doesn't translate particularly well for modern formations. The system that applied a specific number to each position was formulated in the early 20th century when the vast majority of teams were using the Pyramid Formation. It was a 2-3-5: two fullbacks, three halfbacks, and five forwards (two wingers, two inside forwards, and a center forward) playing across the front. The numbering looked like this...

--LW:11--LIF:10--CF:9--RIF:8--RW:7--

----------LHB:6--CHB:5--RHB:4--------

-------------LFB:3--RFB:2-------------

-----------------GK:1-----------------

As formations slowly developed into a the 4-4-2 that is common in England today (with various intermediate systems), two of the halfbacks (usually numbers 5 and 6) were drawn back into the defensive line, becoming known as centerbacks, or, more confusingly, ""centerhalves."" The numbering of modern midfield and forward positions has been more fluid, though 9 is generally still reserved for strikers. The number 10 is usually used for attacking midfielders that play just behind the forward(s), but that is a comparatively recent development.

A short synopsis: 

Fabio Borini is a 21 year old Italian striker who joined Chelsea as a youth in 2007. In 2011, he joined Swansea on loan for the last 9 matches of the season. Borini scored 6 goals in those 9 matches to help Swansea secure promotion to the Premier League. He signed for Parma at the end of the season, but was immediately sent to Roma in a loan deal that turned into a co-ownership deal. At Roma, he saw increased game-time in the 2nd half of the season after primary striker Osvaldo was injured, and repaid Luis Enrique's trust with a total tally of 9 goals over 20 games, making him the 2nd top scorer in Roma. Borini's good form was rewarded with a international cap in a friendly loss against the United States, and he was called up to the Italian national squad for the EURO 2012, but did not play any part in the campaign. 

A quick and intelligent striker, Borini has been compared to the great Filippo Inzaghi. His movement off the last defender is very good, and while he has the ability to play across the whole of the frontline, he should be best played as a fox-in-the-box to spring offside traps.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Your opening paragraph is a sweeping generalization that I'm afraid is both commonplace and flawed. I'll concede that some degrees give you nothing more than proof you can think a problem through / learn / function in a certain environment. However there are plenty out there that teach fundamental information required for the role (or do all medical, architectural, or mechanical engineering degrees constitute fluff and snobbery?). 

Returning to the sentence that you quoted me saying for a moment - it's easy to elaborate. If you (as a potential employee) cannot prove that you have had your skills (be it technical or otherwise) evaluated then why should I (as potential employer) risk looking twice at you, when there are candidates out there who *can* be vouched for by a system trusted for years? Now the way that I wrote this sentence actually covers my back with regards to what you're saying - as I don't say ""if you can boast no degree"" but instead ""no formal training or qualifications"" - which could well mean a vocational course or mentoring or even home tutorship if you can provide some proof of your efforts to a standard that meets requirements. 

Now you can feel free to substitute a university education for an apprenticeship or some kind of mentoring or any other way of proving you've studied a subject or can perform a skill. But if you intend to ""walk in off the streets"" and say you can code in C#, C++ and ASP.NET but have no means of showing it (prior experience, degree or other qualification) then *why should I believe you?*. 

So you'll hopefully see that I am not arguing that those without a university degree are a waste of time - they're not. But if you hope to find work and cannot prove yourself then you're going to have a bad time.

true,6tardis6,k9,K-9,"At first it is hard to get past the cheesy special effects, but after a bit you get into them no problem. As much as I have watched now, the quality and effects really don't both me at all. I hardly notice them. 

I haven't watched much of the 1st and 2nd doctors (sadly not much is available, either), but I do go back and watch them between Netflix discs (just finished Mind Robber, which was also fantastic). I probably take longer than most to watch them because I watch just before bed and don't always last for a full episode. One thing is that while I can marathon a whole season of new Who in a day, it seems the older ones are best digested more slowly. One or two episodes a day unless it's a really thrilling story, such as Genesis of the Daleks. 

To get into them, I really adored Sarah Jane so I watched a few of her stories first. I then learned that the 4th Doctor is my second favorite of all time, so his are always good. Then I decided to try a bit of each Doctor, an found out I really like 5 and 6 as well. 7's kind of ""meh"" for me, but he's good in his own right. 1 is probably my least favorite, but I've also only seen 3 stories, so I can't really judge him yet. It's nice to go back and see the old ones, and realize the new ones have been making jokes about or otherwise referring to the old ones all along. You just don't notice it until you know what they're talking about, unless it's really obvious. The Journey's End 3-parter is especially good after watching Genesis of the Daleks. It's that much scarier, and you REALLY get a feel for why Sarah Jane is so terrified of not just daleks, but Davros. It's a shame most people haven't seen Genesis prior to that series 4 finale.

You're a small business and have need of a graduate programmer. You're not in London and you're not big so you'll afford the market rate for graduates (£20/25k depending on what you find). You can't offer more because a) you don't want to set the bar for all employees as having a £30k starting salary - you're not BT or some other big company - and b) you already have existing developers with a couple of years experience who are on the £30/35k range. 

But all the good graduates have gone to London or BT or wherever. 

So what exactly can you do? Up the salary offered and have your other employees all demand raises or jump ship? Take on someone unsuitable for the job? (90% of the good candidates have jobs already after all - and with better paying large companies that look oh-so-attractive when you're graduating).

And so it's not necessarily greed that means companies have a hard time finding good people - the unfortunate and very real fact remains that the good people aren't stupid and make decisions that see them happily on the great London corporate gravy train. Who can blame them? But with not enough average candidates left out there - there's a shortage. Yes salaries could be upped across the board but I think you feel that's easier than it realistically may be.

Went to court (magistrates) and showed my valid insurance, case immediately dismissed.

 Edit:  Context is probably a good thing here.  I am 26, and when I was first looking for jobs after uni was about 6 months before anyone was informed by the news that economic end-of-days was impending.  What that meant was, for 6 months, despite applying for around 3 jobs a day every day, with aspiration diminishing on a daily basis (i.e. applying for lower and lower quality positions), I was understood to be a bum, scrounging off my parents as I lived at home doing nothing.  I knew something was wrong before anyone else did.  Since then I have got 3 jobs.  One through a family friend who put in a good word for me, then I moved, and got my current 2 jobs through friends in a different city.  I have never earnt more that £7 an hour.  From where I stand, with 4 years work experience and a Masters Degree, this is unlikely to change.

 The only reason I say any of this is because having read the comments here, there seem to be a lot of people older than me that were landing jobs before whatever happened, happened.  It is certainly different now.  I am astonished to hear of anyone landing a half decent job through a standard apply/interview procedure.  And I am yet to be astonished...

- Carry documents on you, it makes you seem more 'law abiding' and organised. A year ago a glitch on their system claimed I had no insurance and as it was a Sunday night they were unable to call my insurance company. Technically he could have taken my vehicle but as I had the proof certificate he gave me the benefit of the doubt.

- If there are issues with your car, claim not to have realised and be shocked. (Balding tyres, lightbulb out, illegal numberplate script etc). This may seem a bit slimey, but it's just that they won't be happy if it seems you 'thought you'd get away with it for a bit'.

- Give excuses for having done something wrong, but show that you don't think this is a justification. ""I'm really sorry, I'm really late to collect my daughter and she just rang me in tears. I know that's not an excuse, I was just a bit stressed out"" etc etc. Don't make it seem like you feel entitled to break the law, just that it's unusual for you and you're remorseful.

- Never admit to carrying anything 'for protection'. I saw a guy get arrested on a TV programme for saying exactly this when they asked why he had a bat in his car. Pretty crazy!

- Be friendly. They gain little pleasure in dealing with useless drivers.

So should she ignore the treaty? Can she ? She's just the home secretary after all, not the PM. 

What would the cost to the UK be if we pissed of the USA by saying that we've unilaterally decided to withdraw from the treaty? What would the long term damage to diplomatic relations be?

Revealing stuff this morning so far. First the court watched the last 15 minutes of the game though nothing was gained from this aside from a close up and replay of AF making the 'shagging Bridge's missus' mime at Terry

Terry took the stand and accounted for himself very well. I'll leave you to read the exact quotes yourself but he said all the right things including a finale featuring 'some of my best friends are black' rationale

Terry explained himself to an FA rep after the game and laid it out exactly as he is still maintaining to this day, AF started it and he merely repeated it asking if he heard him correctly, since it was so surprising to him

Great thing to bring up, JT says if he wanted to abuse him he'd whisper it in his ear. With all the cameras around he knew he'd be recorded so shouted it openly as he had nothing to hide

GCS QC insisted the court listen to the full recordings of all interviews to hear tone, inflections etc. Great move again, JT coming off extremely well and most importantly, consistent

Major point of contention. AF says he heard nothing until after the game, JT testified that he (JT) told Ashley Cole during the match that AF had accused him of calling him a black cunt. Conflicting statements but JT has AC as a corroborator 

Next up on the stand is a DC with the police. He is dropping major truth bombs today...

DC: Rigby (AF's and RF's PR man) said if AF didn't complain to police he would advise him to open a civil case

GCS QC: Rigby had undue influence, was openly discussing evidence with AF and advising

EnglishMD Tin foil hat moment: Since Rigby works for the Ferdinands, what's to stop Rio calling him and pushing him to promote this case, he knew JT would lose the armband and could only expect to inherit it from 'Onest 'Arry. The connections between Rigby and the Ferdinands is really questionable

DC: Police had to go through Rigby just to get to AF, he's inextricably linked

DC: AF initially extremely reluctant to even appear as a witness

DC: QPR and AF both described as extremely uncooperative by police

DC: Rigby provided police with a list of Chelsea players who should be interviewed. This is really stacking up against that twat now

DC: Rigby told police blacks would feel that a white mans word is stronger than a black mans word if charges weren't brought against JT

DC: Complaint to police was made by an off duty cop watching the game on TV. Unbelievable

12:35

Prosecution case over, all evidence presented. GCS QC now making a statement regarding burden of proof, reasonable doubt, veracity of statements and witnesses etc..

GCS QC: Ferdinand is clearly an unreliable witness, misleading about facts relating to incident

GCS QC: ""There are 5 headings of evidence against Mr Terry..even when viewed together do not represent a prima facie case against Mr Terry"" Boom, headshot

GCS QC: ""In his witness statement he does not refer to making a verbal comment to Mr Terry. That position has significantly altered.""

GCS QC: ""If he believes he said something that might have been misinterpreted, why is it not in the statement?""

GCS QC: ""We have situation where his evidence has expanded to take on board what he now knows is shown on the video""

Personal note: Let me state this again for it is extremely important. The reason this farce has gone to court is because Rigby and the Ferdinands threatened to go to the media and make a public racial stink about the police and their prejudice (hence trotting out Doreen Lawrence) if the CPS didn't charge Terry. This is so out of order I can't even explain. We had national riots last year on the back of perceived institutional police racism and the Ferdinands have gone way over the line here. The subtext to this case is obvious for all to see, hope the Magistrates don't go with public opinion and have some balls, this is a nonsense case

13:00 : GCS QC has pushed for the case to be thrown out citing a lack of evidence, tenuous connections and unreliable witnesses. Case adjourned until 14:00

14:00 : Prosecution is now arguing that the case should not be thrown out as there is a still a case to answer

14:05 : The interview between JT and the FA rep will be on Sky Sports News later today

The bottom line is that it is simple enough to get a job without knowing any one, but it's quicker and easier to go between jobs if you do.

Most BBC shows are either just bad ideas or are excellent throughout. They don't do filler episodes.

I don't think fairness comes into it. It is a superior model for providing what customers want but probably not to maximise profit. The advantage of this model is the customer is the viewer. From the customers perspective less of his money is being wasted on services designed only to serve advertisers. He gets fewer pointless episode and less wasted time.

Poyet will remedy this with the money he has to spend im sure, and like he said last season we had the good runs of a league winner however we lacked the consistancy in the big no victory runs before the new year and towards the end of the season. Everyone in our team will now have some experience of championship football/ premiership oppositon, fit more with our style of play and the confidence that a second season in the championship will bring. I think this could a great season for us but whether it will be that great season that goes down in the clubs history we will have to wait and see, but with 23000 season ticket holders and hopefully 30000 capacity crowds we will do it in style.

New thread now. Magistrate says there is a case to answer and JT is called to the stand by GCS QC. Ridiculous, but here we go

JT talking about abuse being part of the game, namely all the stuff he's been on the receiving end of. Look forward to GCS QC tearing Rigby apart

JT: Discussing the obstructed part of the video, giving his version of events. Don't fark it up JT!

14:35 

JT: Confirming he only used the phrase 'Black cunt' when asking AF if that's what he's actually accusing him of

JT: Says he repeated words ""out of shock""...If someone said to me I was a fat cunt or an ugly cunt I would repeat that back to them.""

JT: Says he told Ashley Cole about AF's allegations of racism while game was still in play. Completely contradicts AF's version of events where he says he knew nothing about racism until after the game. Get Ash in here to confirm JT's side and AF's case is blown out

15:00 JT's defence has stepped aside to allow for the prosecution cross examination, beginning in 5 minutes

15:30 : 5 minutes or however long they feel like really. Still waiting

15:50 : CPS asks JT if ""Your mums a slag"" is much more common than he's suggesting, JT says he;s only heard it directed at him by fellow professionals. JT also responds to a question by saying he is respected by the football community

15:55 : CPS is almost exclusively talking about alleged affair with Perroncel

16:10 : CPS pursuing the line that JT snapped after affair chat and lost the plot. Though a year had passed and it's unlikely that he'd suddenly feel affected by it during that particular game. Rather weak argument 

CPS: ""It's fair to say you are a supreme athlete?""  
JT: ""I used to be""  
CPS: ""Also fair to say Paddy Kenny is rather overweight""  
JT: ""The camera adds a few pounds""  

And at 16:20 we are done for the day again. JT came off alright in the cross-exam, he did admit to losing control of his emotions but he says it was only after AF accused him of racism. CPS is suggesting he accused AF of having bad breath, then called him a 'fucking black cunt' when that didn't work.

true,Dobmeister,eng-TyneWear,Newcastle,"A usual way it works on non-BBC channels, is two ad breaks in every half-hour.  An episode of The Simpsons, showing on Sky1, would, say, start at 7pm, run until mid-distance ~7:12, break until ~7:15, with about 5 commercial ads and two Sky network-specific either side, show the rest of the ep to ~7:27, and a second ad break would run with similar content to the prior.  The slot for an ep of CSI, for instance, while less than an hour of show content, would start and finish in 60.

Watching TV in Australia, I noticed more frequent ad breaks, and slots would segue seamlessly into eachother, with the preceding show placing its final ad break - the one UK viewers expect as the interlude - before a final minute or two of content and credits.  And that weirds me out.  But it was handy to go direct from

So the turnout was higher than the first around. This rewritten legislation was then voted for by more people and was therefore more representative of the countries opinion.

Seriously, if you think the legislation was just voted for until the right answer was given you've been reading too much of the telegraph. That is simply not the case.

Edit: The referendum was required because of the Irish constitution. Also, even if the legislation hadn't been rewritten, a majority of people still voted for it.

If done correctly by the government as a whole, this issue can be managed and we can limit the damage that the USA will try and cause.

My statements here are purely in defence of Theresa May. I do not believe that she should be called a bitch for adhering to the law as written and approved of by the UK populace at the time of writing. 

Remember, we voted the same government that signed this treaty back in after they signed it! We gave them another term after they signed this, sent hundreds of young British men to die for oil and killed thousands of innocent civilians for a) living near oil and b) being brown

I absolutely believe that something should be changed after the fact. I believe that the government as a whole needs to address this, and from what I understand, there have been (and possibly still are) discussions about this in whitehall.

Personally, I don't think we should be. I mean, I want him to develop into a great player, but there's no guarantee that he could be. If we sign Borini and Carroll plays, lets just say the first few games and struggles, then Borini arrives and plays better, then we'll all want to see Borini play in place of Carroll.

I think his price tag is having a lot of emphasis, and I think Rodgers is going to try and ignore that. At the end of the day, he's a player who had a poor season last season, though he does have potential but that doesn't mean we should totally focus our team around him and treat him like the next Robbie Fowler.

Similarly Danny Graham, his striker at Swansea, wasn't a tiki-taka level player, but he did have good movement and dragged defenders out of position to create space for the wide players to attack. 

Rodgers' system doesn't require as much technical ground ability in the final third as it does in the back four and midfield trio. In that front three, intelligent movement is more important. Obviously Carroll still has work to do on movement and on technical ability with the ball at his feet, but if he can improve in that area then we have a striker who can play in our system but also offers a greater aerial threat and ability to hold up the ball and flick it on more than Borini would be able to, giving us options.",0,1341936804,null,0,false,0,c5c0jir,t3_wboz1,t1_c5c0jir,t1_c5c0bbh,null,1429341719,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

All of our other TV channels do show adverts.  There is usually a 5 minute break approximately every 15 minutes.

Some special programs have different advertising patterns.

When Milton Keynes was built there was no thought at all to running anything else over the telephone lines - they were for voice calls, nothing else.  Aluminium was fine for that, and I think copper prices were peaking to historic levels.

But the problem is not only with the aluminium lines, but their length. 

My dad was, around the time Milton Keynes was built, an electrical engineer for British Telecom, and in the previous couple of decades (1950s - 1970s) uptake of landline telephones had increased dramatically. I think the installed userbase had doubled in 2 decades but when I was kid in the 70s, there were still people who had to pop 'round to the neighbours to make a phonecall.

So around the time Milton Keynes was built British Telecom were building telephone exchanges with massive overcapacity, anticipating the demand for the next 20 years, and not knowing what the fuck they were going to do when these exchanges were over-subscribed. 

What else was going on in the 70s? The transistor revolution - all these big old exchanges were based on fuck off huge 10' high [Strowger switches](http://i.imgur.com/3nKKI.jpg). So along came the technological revolution and using new transistorised equipment BT were able to switch many more calls in much less space.

Milton Keynes was expanding in the middle of this - it was only 25 or 30 years ago that Furtzon and the Shelneys were all fields, and suddenly there was all this empty space in the Fishermed (""Bradwell Abbey"") exchange. Its reach was extended, and thus these areas are much further from the exchange than is required for broadband (which obviously had not been thought of yet).

Until at least the 80s (I have no idea whether this continued into the 90s), all homes in Milton Keynes were wired with coaxial cable TV. Homes in Fishermead and Oldbrook, for sure all have the appropriate wall socket in their living rooms, I looked at a property yesterday in Hodge Lee which does, too.

This was before satellite TV, and it was how the future was anticipated - Milton Keynes had a pioneering independent cable TV provider, one of the first in the country, and the development corporation had demanded that developers impose a covenant on the houses that they built, so that homeowners agreed they wouldn't be able to install unsightly TV aerials.

This was the forerunner to NTL / Virgin Media's cable services, but it turns out that the coax cable, too, was too low quality to run more than a dozen or so channels (it was laid in the days before even channel 4) so when the kinds of covenants that prevented TV aerials were struck down in the courts, everyone got Sky instead and MK's local cable was unable to compete (that co-ax is obviously too low-quality for broadband, too).

I still vividly remember once hearing Lonergan trying to command the players in front of him, and by that I mean Johnny Howson. It was early in the season - against Bristol City or Crystal Palace, perhaps? - and the crowd's atmosphere had died down, so that I could hear him shouting at the top of his voice: ""Jon! Jon! Jon!

I believe that, more often than not, he was let down by the back four and forced to try and rescue the team out of situations we shouldn't have been in to start with.

However, I will admit that he has been beaten a worrying number of times on long-range shots. That said, am I right in thinking that Kenny has that weakness, too?

You NEED to possess a certain aptness for suspense of disbelief and taking things with a pinch of salt.

Some episodes are silly, yes. But those that are worth it...by God, are they worth it.

In reference to the humans torturing the space whale Matt states, ""Nobody human has anything to say to me today."" This was a side of The Doctor that I have never witnessed. I understand he was upset about the whale but he hasn't ever gone this far in his anger at the human race. 

I bring this up because to truly get to know The Doctor, you have to know each of The Doctors. There are some episodes that seem to drag.

My experience, having introduced five people to Doctor Who, is to start with Eleventh Hour.  Rose is a fine enough episode, but it's slow and surprisingly dated (it feels very much like it could pass for an early 90's sci-fi show), which can be a turn-off.  Eleventh Hour has a lot of the introductory Doctor bits, but much more humor and a faster pacing.  It's a great hook episode, though it does mess with the viewing timeline a bit.

If you're really sold on starting with a mid-series episode, my suggestions would be: Fires of Pompei, A Good Man Goes to War, The Girl Who Waited, Vincent and the Doctor, The Girl in the Fireplace, or the Empty Child / Time of Angels arcs, if two episodes is okay.",0,1341940672,null,0,false,0,c5c1juy,t3_wbobo,t1_c5c1juy,t3_wbobo,null,1429342192,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You have to remember that FSG just made a massive investment in this lad, and they're not ones to piss cash away at an instant without taking all possibilities into consideration. Surely Andy was a topic of discussion between them and Brendan in the process of hiring him. More importantly, not only has Aquilani proved that loaning out an expensive signing is a less than safe business model, but Andy himself has proven that he has trouble settling in new environments. Naturally, from a business standpoint, a loan will not likely be very advantageous, as his future worth will be conditioned on his (probably less than 5 star) performance. The ONLY way to justify sending our pet pony away would be to ensure he's replaced with someone too good to pass up, regardless of Brendan's model. It's the same with Chelsea and Torres-- they clearly feel they have to incorporate him into their new model simply because of the disparity between their initial investment and his current worth.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I think, like you say, it's strange that the left would still blame Thatcher for the state of things now - given that we had 13 odd years or whatever of Labour who could surely have shifted position and undone the Thatcher changes.

You're not accounting for the fact that some political and social decisions have unforeseen consequences which will not begin to develop for a decade.

Thatcher's privatisation of the council houses is one of these - in the mid 70s, shortly before she came to power, [*one third* of the population lived in council housing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs). 

So Thatcher didn't do something *immediately* dramatic like dispossessing all the current council house residents of the time, but she handed a bunch of equity to people who had never had that kind of money before, and at the same time she robbed the nation of a huge national asset. 

So now we have an older generation who profited heavily off that 80s property boom - including some who took advantage of the council house sell-off - who are expecting the government to protect their ""investment"" and the value of their properties.

And simultaneously we have another generation who can't afford to buy a home (the average age of first time buyers is now [higher than ever](http://www.independent.co.uk/money/mortgages/firsttime-buyers-life-begins-at-40-6265083.html)), who are giving a significant chunk of their income each week to landlords.

Imagine the government subcontracting legal arbitration and small-scale criminal cases to a company called Order UK (with prominent MPs on the board in an *advisory capacity*, given their extensive backgrounds) specialising in independent arbitration, and being paid for clearing backlogs of delayed cases as quickly as possible. At no point whatsoever could there be any conflict between justice and profits, as board members are required to self-report any conflicts of interest and personal prejudices.

Solicitors and barristers would be more than welcome in the system, but must first be approved, and pay to attend the requisite courses specified by Order UK, signing a licensing agreement to 'uphold legal standards' with a suitable code of conduct and a mandatory confidentiality agreement to protect the rights of people participating in such cases. 

With the specialist and unparalleled knowledge-base and its strong position in the market, Order UK would also gain from a merger/cross-pollination with a privatised prison system (again, receiving a state subsidy per prisoner), to provide a one-stop shop for the state's justice solutions, whilst upholding the finest traditions of the British legal system. 

The prisoners could be set to work to repay their debt to society during their stay in a protective facility. Obviously, rehabilitative programs will be axed due to not being economically viable and being an ineffective use of taxpayers' money.

This merger could then form the basis for an entire umbrella organisation, perhaps sharing board members(/MPs) with a company (hypothetically similar to G4S) contracted by the state to provide policing solutions for support in dealing with the rampant crime that happens in adverse economic conditions. 

The Protection and Compliance Agency would form part of an integrated and streamlined approach (again being paid per case closed) ensuring that the public can rest assured in the knowledge that the invisible hand of market forces is ensuring the most effective use of their money, and protection against corruption and abuse of power.

As the organisation registers record profits (proof the company is succeeding admirably in its aims of top-quality consumer service at a fraction of the cost), it takes on additional functions of the state that have been downsized due to austerity measures, such as social care, tax collection, more serious crimes and local governmental functions.

If you delay medical treatment by even small times you can risk serious problems from that delay.

Mata---------Sturridge-------Torres


Subs: Always Lukaku and Drogs for Torres and a tossup between the Mata/Sturr depending on who is most tired. Last sub is Kalou if remaining Mata/Sturr is dead or I'm down, otherwise its usually Essien for Ramires/Lampard.

Lampard needs to be used for his shooting and passing strengths. Ramires is clutch with the LB+A (pass and move) to Lampard and making great runs unmarked upfield. I like to use Mata/Torres coming in on their strong foot for a deep finesse shot or a nice rip. 

By far the best attack I have with Mata on RW playing Sturridge into the corner where Sturridge can either beat his man or look for Torres coming in for the cross.

Lukaku is a monster at LW and sometimes ST (when im up pretty big) because of his strength over all LB. Having him and Drogba on at the same time as supersubs is not fair due to strength/speed/shot power combo.",0,1341953270,null,0,false,0,c5c52t2,t3_w8fh8,t1_c5c52t2,t3_w8fh8,null,1429343921,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Also, most treatments and diagnoses basically follow a playbook anyway. If you complain of tiredness they basically run through a set list of questions and tests depending on your age, history, lifestyle etc. Same with test results.

I still think we should shift more of the work onto nurses, or nurse practitioners. You don't need 10 years of medical training to dispense prescriptions for common ailments, and you can pay 3 nurses for the cost of one GP. Makes perfect sense to me. 

Besides, if this is a privately run GP surgery (which most are), then they can do whatever they want. If the patient care isn't suffering (and the article gave no evidence that it was worse) then there's no problem at all.

I mean in a different post here, [you point out that you yourself own several firearms, and enjoy them](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/wc5m3/as_an_american_this_made_me_laugh_a_lot/c5c4um9?context=3).  You yourself subscribe the the gun culture in America, where the vast majority of people have no real need for one other than the enjoyment of owning a firearm.  I haven't fired a weapon since 2005 when I left the service.

In the 7 years since I left the service, I have seen gun violence manifest itself in everything from Gabby Giffords to Travon Martin.  Giffords was a tragedy by a mad man, but Travon Martin was an example of a twit with a Glock and a hard on for vigilante justice.  There was no need for a pistol to even be involved in that.  Yet it was a case of cowboy vigilantism.  

Look at our movies, video games, hobbies.  Modern Warfare, Battlefield, Old West movies, war movies...I mean America essentially invented the ""never reload"" action film, one of our national icons is John Wayne who built his reputation on being a cowboy and Marine, paintball and Airsoft....seriously airsoft.  A sport where you shoot BB's from incredibly realistic BB guns and play in MOUNT environments

American's love guns, Americans like their violence, they like their ""LIVE FREE OR DIE"" attitude.  It defined us as a nation throughout the 19th and early 20th Century and was personified in people as varied as Davy Crockett, Billy the Kid, Teddy Roosevelt, and Wild Bill Hickock, to John Wayne, John McClain, and G.I. Joe.  

Does this make us dreadful evil people?  No.  What sort of ridiculous assumption is that?  We are often commented on as some of the nicest, friendliest people in the world.  We are loud, boisterous, and exciteable (often compared to the socially subdued European), we are stubborn, pig headed, and obstinate [Just ask Churchill](http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2313).  Yet, we always mean well.  We are ultimately altruistic, trusting, generous, kind, and forgiving.

But God help you, if we think you threaten us, will will shoot you in the face with a fucking shotgun.
