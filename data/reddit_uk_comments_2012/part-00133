This would also put an end to the whole ""no one knowing who the fuck the doctor is"" debacle.

Alt theory: We see things play out, when her tenure as a companion is over &amp; she decides to stop traveling with the doctor--a la Martha, not all companions have something horrible force them to stop, some just choose to move on to something else-- she then joins the Alaska SANS AMNESIA....it is plausible that she isn't an idiot and realizes she'd be telling this younger Doctor his future if she explained who she was...thus pretending to be a stranger.

tl;dr--maybe the asylum of the daleks is prevented or clara knows the rules of timeywimey, either way NO AMNESIA

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Yeah, that's definitely true - for 2 main reasons that I see:

First of all the Lim Dems obviously would have preferred a PR referendum instead of AV, but I'm guessing (?) that they weren't willing to give this. That should have been *the* thing that they wouldn't leave without because it a) would have had a far greater chance of passing, and b) would have given us (and the Lib Dem party) the best long-term future. However to get that they may have had to sacrifice more, or possibly it simply wasn't an option the Tories were willing to give *at all* because of how much it would damage their future. So perhaps this isn't an option that was open in reality. Still sucks, though.

The *second* issue is what has happened when the Tories have broken parts of the agreement. What I suggest might cause political chaos to an extent *if it went all the way* (unlikely) but you have to draw a line somewhere. What has happened is the Lib Dems have just said ""okay you broke that part of the agreement so we're not going to support something different, later"" - imo they should have stuck 100% to the agreement under threat of immediately breaking up the government if anything was done against it. If that happened the Lib Dems would come out as heroes for not being bullied by the Tories, but instead they've just gone further into the getting-trodden-all-over territory. And I'm not saying the result of breaking up the govt would have happened, but if that was an immediate threat then the Tories would have been *very unlikely* to break any part of the agreement, because there's doubt they would win an election were it held again right now. That is one of the biggest chips the Lib Dems are holding, and it is a legitimate reason to break up to coalition.",0,1349022325,null,0,false,0,c6fk66w,t3_10pfqv,t1_c6fk66w,t1_c6fjzvd,null,1430028167,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I'm 19 years old and want to play goalkeeper professionally. Is it still possible?

Yes.

GK have the BIG advantage of getting better and more desirable the older they get (within reason), 24+ is considered to be the time frame when most keepers start to become more first team trustworthy.

In the time leading up to that age they are expected to have built up a wealth of confidence and experience. 

They are also a lot more desirable because the majority of people want to be outfield players.


For a start, weight train, focus on work your arms, shoulders, neck

&gt; And what should I do to get the attention of professional squads?

Start a fire at a match, trust me, you'll get EVERYONES attention...

OR,

play in a local team by putting in regular brilliant games your reputation will build and the more games you win the more attention you get (particularly clean sheets) while there sign up to every 5 a side, 7 a side, 11 a side tournament you can enter yourself in, trust me the experience you'll gain from playing against different players and abilities in different formations will priceless, also winning them normally gets some mention in a paper or reported, keep these and build up a portfolio.

I was approached at a tournament, so they do and are being watched and normally winning one will get you invited to a another/bigger one.

true,tinyphotographer,tennant,Tennant,"I think with Amy it's a little different. He still thinks of her as ""little Amelia"" in a way (the fact that he calls her ""Pond"" instead of ""Williams"" and Rory as well seems to me as a way to nullify the fact that she's a grown woman). His whole relationship with her is built around the fact that he's her ""raggedy man,"" her imaginary friend. It was built on her childhood devotion to him. 

Her getting older just causes a rift in their relationship. She isn't the little girl who made him fish fingers and custard and she doesn't need to believe in him anymore. She doesn't need to run off with him and have adventures, or even to distract her from the crack in her wall. Plus she has Rory in a way she didn't have Rory when they started. The Doctor was an escape from a world that Amy either couldn't stand or couldn't make sense of. She's grown up and is ready to finally have a real life. And I think secretly, the Doctor wishes he could have that too (it *was* touched upon in 10th's run).

River is a completely different story, partly because I don't think the Doctor loves her. I think he is fond of her and accepts the idea of her but I don't think it's the same. I think his relationship with Amy trumped River. But what I love about Doctor Who is that even if you do think he loves River or you didn't think he loved Rose, etc. it's completely up to you. So no more from me on that subject.

I think the way the Doctor handles age is different for each regeneration and each companion. I just think Amy's aging is extremely hard on him due to the nature of their relationship and the foundation it was built on. If the Doctor had first met her when she was an adult (i.e. the kissogram days), I don't think he would be as torn up over her aging. It also doesn't help that Amy and Rory treat the Doctor as a child. It was ""cute"" at first but I think it makes the Doctor feel like a trivial part of their lives. It gives the idea that their time together was a childish adventure and that they've outgrown him.",0,1349022593,null,0,false,0,c6fk8ec,t3_10p32f,t1_c6fk8ec,t3_10p32f,null,1430028200,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The jokes have been bland and terribly obvious, the production value shot up and the writing has suffered for it (Dinosaurs being the supreme example), and frankly the disjointedness in the Doctor's relationship with the Ponds has alienated me further from them as companions than Smith's other two seasons. 

Yes, RTD's Rose finale was a little cheesy, but coming from four episodes dripping with even worse kitsch, Moffat's season 7 has been a huge letdown. 3 of the 5 episodes of season 7 have been worth watching and one of those is the final farewell to the Ponds (which shouldn't be anything less than fantastic). Frankly, I'm disappointed with the writing direction of the show and find that Moffet is far more pandering in the most recent half a season. 

Hell, anyone watching BBC America would have seen the terrible commercials literally shouting about ""THE FINAL FAREWELL TO AMY AND RORY"" all week long. It's shameful to see how Hollywood the show has become.

First, the angels were ""farming"" people in that area/time period, creating massive amounts of time energy for them to feed on. This made it difficult to land the TARDIS there in the first place. Second, Amy and Rory are time travelers themselves, meaning that they are effected by time energy as well and tangle up that section of space and time further. Finally, there's the Rory dying twice paradox. River calls that ""poisoning the well"" for the Angels. I think we can assume that the TARDIS doesn't like paradoxes like that either. This nasty ball of timey-wimey paradoxes and excess energy could have solidified into a fixed-point in time. If the Doctor tried to unravel any part of it, it might explode and deal serious damage to the universe.

TL;DR: Overlapping paradoxes and massive amounts of time energy might be what created the fixed point and also might keep the TARDIS from being able to land near the Ponds.

As the article state: The UK formed independent commission, lead by Sir John Vickers, recommended to split the banking operations. Tories and Libdems are already planning to do it by 2019, now Labour are scoring political points by suggesting if they win the next election they will do it by 2015 -- Boo haha.

The issue should be taken more serious by voters, there will be massive implications; The city of London is now fighting for its right to be the financial head quarters of the world, it is risky and will have a big impact on jobs and the future of Britain. The only way Labour can win is to position themselves as the party that can lead that change, this seems to be the first step in that direction and will result in a more mature political debate about banking regulations. Exactly what the banking industry needs.

The irony is, those that hate bankers will not have a party to vote for.

The most difficult aspect of watching season 7 is that lack of continuity from season 6. We've had to wait until the ""mid-season finale"" to get any mention of the Doctor wiping his name from every database in the universe, ever.

I personally think the Americanization of the show is hurting it.  And by that I mean the push to make it fit into an hour format.

First I am not a fan of Moffat wanting to split the season, trying to get a year out of the show, that seems to cut the flow of the show.

Second, they are cutting off 10-15 minutes from the show to get it to an American hour time format with commercials in mind.  I don't blame Moffat for this one.  But it cuts off the flow of the show and rushes dialogue.  The show should not be viewed with commercials, I tried to watch it on BBC America and I just can't, doesn't feel right.

You have good points about the story arch, but I think there is more that could have been done if the show was the longer time format as it was before.

First off, remember the circumstances of the election. When it became clear that there was a hung parliament, we needed a strong coalition formed quickly to reassure the markets that the UK was capable of making the hard budgetary decisions which would deal with its massive deficit. In that sense, what the Lib Dems did was in the best interest of the country and they deserve a lot of credit for that.

Second, remember that in Coalition politics the larger party is always going to have the most influence. Now had the AV+ referendum gone through the Lib Dems might have returned with more MP's next parliament. On the other hand they might not have, but in either case it would likely mean more of exactly what we have now. *Remember that this is exactly what the Liberal Democrats and their supporters wanted.*

Thirdly, and most importantly, the ability of our parties to reach compromise on issues they have ideological differences over is essential to the health of our democracy.

  From Wikipedia:  

&gt;The Act did not alleviate the problem, existing at the time, of interference between multiple users of the radio spectrum... There was already an ongoing conflict between amateur radio operators and the U.S. Navy and private companies. Amateur radio enthusiasts regarded the new medium as a wide-open new frontier, free from government regulation and corporate influence. They fought against government and corporate encroachment in many ways, including by sending fake distress calls and obscene messages to naval radio stations, and forged naval commands sending navy boats on spurious missions. It was this, in addition to the public outcry after the sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'' and an international convention agreed in London, that caused Congress to replace the Wireless Ship Act with the Radio Act of 1912.[1]

Forged naval commands and fake distress signals eh?  No problem here.  Move along.  Just good old libertarians fighting the good fight! No chance of mission critical failure there!  That and one tiny little cruise liner... Ignore the iceberg in the room.

Can you give a logical reason why land rights would be considered essential for commerce, but similar rights in the public airways wouldn't be?  The airwaves are just as finite, their use at one frequency procludes other use at the same frequency in the same way that use of land at one location necessarily interferes with/precludes the use of that same land by another party.  If you don't believe in any property rights, that's one thing, but if you do, why the inconsistency?

There is no in-universe answer for that. _Because it would completely cheapen and invalidate the concept of fixed points even more than they already have_.

&gt;  What if not acting is what causes the paradox?

I agree, however, that ""Blink"", great as it is, isn't the optimal introduction to Doctor Who, as it might create wrong expectations. After all, one of the things that make ""Blink"" great is how it's *different* from what we usually get.

I do think some of the overexpectation and overthinking of fans might come from people assuming that, because Moffat has sometimes planted little clues and hints that paid off much later, this means *everything* is a deliberately planted clue and *there is a grand master plan at work which only the true faithful can recognize.*  That's not watching a tv show; that's turning it into a religion.  And not the healthy kind of religion where it inspires you to do good deeds, but the unhealthy kind where you go all Da Vinci Code.  

Truth is, a lot of the time Moffat really doesn't know what he's doing.  I promise you all he'd tell you this himself!  It's just how writing works.  It's not a thing where you conceive a work of masterful genius fully formed and then transcribe your revelations.  In writing, you toss something in that seems like a good idea at the moment but you don't know why, then you see if it turns out to be useful later.  Sometimes it doesn't pay off.  You make it up as you go along.  Part of the trick is making it look like you meant to do that all along.  If you ask Neil Gaiman or Paul Cornell or anyone, they'll tell you the same thing. 

One trick a writer pulls out when things aren't coming together is to distract the audience by adding in a lot of extra stuff, so the loose ends don't stand out so much in all the confusion.  That's a trick Moffat has been using more and more to less and less effect.  He thinks ""cram more ideas in"" equates to ""crazy thrill ride"" but sometimes it turns into wearing out the viewer until they're burnt out with unresolved plot thread overload.  I wish he'd concentrate more on sorting things out instead of distraction.",0,1349033913,null,0,false,0,c6fn1ix,t3_10px83,t1_c6fn1ix,t3_10px83,null,1430029521,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

While some of the episodes seem rushed and lacking, you have to realize that there's more that goes into this than just writing a show.

Zola is the reason a large number of fans became attached to the club. I would also put Ossie and Tambling up there.

Now I may be going off tangent, but because the doctor smashes the plate [18:08], I think this means that the doctor can find a way to see Amy and Rory again.

Also, it doesn't look like his situation with Real Madrid is going to get any better. With Luka Modric at Real now, there are an abundance of midfielders that are above Sahin in the pecking order.

true,eclipse007,null,null,"&gt; CHAPTER 12 .......AMELIA's **LAST** FAREWELL

There's no absolution inherent to a farewell. That's why it's proceeded by 'last' in this case. Doesn't mean Doctor can't have other hello-goodbyes in between while this one is established and fixed as the last.

Only events seen or read have to happen the same way (and even in that be perceived the same way). Any second that Doctor didn't know about can be re-written. Ponds would always die and be buried in the same graveyard but how they live the rest of their lives is what no one knows since it hasn't happened yet. This is a plot hole.

However, I think people are trying too hard to fill in gaping plot holes in a show that has always been and will always be littered with those. We should just accept and enjoy it as is. Time travel invites plot holes and if they try to be explicit with avoiding them then you'll be met with a scientific documentary rather than a TV show.

Lots of people will tell you to start with the episode called ""Blink,""  but I think that's a bad idea. Firstly, that episode is 3 seasons into the revived series and the Doctor is only in it in flash backs for the most part and little snips on some DVDs. You've also completely missed one incarnation of the Doctor and his first companion for the revived series. That is why I don't recommend watching ""Blink""first. 

Anyway, if you like the series as it is now, you can go back and watch some of the older episodes from it's original run. Those are also on Netflix.

He's using a government study that said the government needed to intervene to prove that the government needed to intervene.  How the hell am I even supposed to respond?  Then he decides I'm anti-American.  What, is this a variation on the No True Scotsman fallacy?  

It's preposterous to expect me to try and discuss government overreach with someone that *actually believes* it makes sense to site *government studies* which show that the government *isn't overreaching* as a valid means of debate.

Really?

I guess that Mormon studies that show that Mormons are 100% correct in their theology should be taken at face value since the Mormons say that they should?

How bizarre!  I can't even begin to understand the frame of mind of a person so completely enraptured by government power and ""good faith"" that they would use government studies as a defense to government actions.

I know that, sorry I worded it poorly.  I meant that Moffat is getting an American hour length slot (45-46 minutes,) versus the 50+ minutes the show had before.  Before if a US network wanted the show they would either show them unedited (PBS,) put them in a 90 minute slot to get in commercials (Syfy,) or cut the length down to fit an hour (which BBC America was doing.)

Ever since they decided to show them the same day (UK US,) starting last season, the time has been cut down for Moffat.  I have no idea why the decision was made, they could have done what Syfy did.  Instead the decision was to cut the production down across the board.

Honestly the show should only be shown on PBS in the US, in my neck of the woods the first series of the reboot was.

I thought when it came to interfering with fixed points in time, that it's not that you cannot interfere, but that if you do interfere, you need to keep all appearances that the timeline has not been altered. The Doctor's Wife was kind of big on this, in that you can take the events one of two ways: 1.) the Doctor originally does die at Lake Silencio, at that point, but upon hearing news of his imminent death, decides to rewrite things (he had to appear to die, in order that River's 'quest,' as given by the Silence, be fulfilled, so as to break her of their spell, or the Silence would continue intervening / reprogramming her as time itself changed), or 2.) the Doctor originally never died at Lake Silencio, that he always, always had faked his death.

You see this kind of threaded time in other works of fiction: Terry Pratchett has one novel, the name escapes me, wherein an evil Duke is supposed to assassinate a Princess, and in time unify the surrounding kingdoms; one of Death's helpers (think it's Mort) decides to give the idea a miss, which results in a paradox (time bubble), which is finally resolved when Death has a talk with the gods, and comes to an agreement that so long as the Princess unifies the kingdoms, they're fine with the Princess continuing to reign.

Yes. And it would've been so easy to close those plot holes: 

When the Doctor is reading the book at the beginning:

Amy: What are you doing?

11: Oh, I always read the ending first.

Amy: But- *the doctor slams the book shut*

Amy: What? What did it say? 

11: Nothing. Nothing at all.

Then the episode carries on pretty much the same way it did, with the Doctor furiously trying to change things he knows he can't change, and at the end, we get Amy's letter via messenger (a callback to *Blink*).

It doesn't have to be the Doctor, either. Anyone absentmindedly flipping through the book would fix it. If that collector had gotten it for a few seconds, flipped through, scanned a page near the end, and tossed it aside, that would've done it just as well.

He later says the exact thing she read and just by saying those lines, he fulfilled what had to be, but continued to act like he had to break River's arm. That I didn't get.

It's ASDA policy for colleagues - including security - to attempt to detain suspected shoplifters but to not try to restrain them, apart holding their sleeve, telling them they can't leave and blocking their exit.

If the suspect then uses force to remove their hand, or pushes them out of the way, they are told to let them go, for several reasons:

It doesn't look good for the store to have any altercation with members of the public. Parents don't want their kids hearing profanities while doing their weekly shop.

The suspect may assault the security, with or without a weapon, which could lead to a lawsuit.

The suspect may get hurt, have a medical condition, or even pre-existing bruises to his arm which he could say the security did, which could lead to a lawsuit. 

Other members of the public might be nearby and could get hurt, WCLTAL.

Store policy is to just let the suspect go if there's any chance it's going to get messy and just review the CCTV, notify the police and circulate photos to avoid them entering their stores again.

ASDA will do everything they can to settle out of court. I'm interested to see how this one plays out.

Not your post - that's fine - but this whole process... registering months beforehand in order to purchase tickets, submitting a passport photo in order to qualify, etc., etc..  

I've been to Glastonbury 6 times, but the last time was nearly 20 years ago - back when you could still roll up without a ticket and just buy one off someone lurking in a hedge outside. Or, if you were feeling particularly frisky, jump the fence at the risk of a broken ankle, or being frogmarched straight back out the gate. And still, older attendees back then were bemoaning that it had become unbearably corporate. 

But this high-security, officious, job application-type procedure is about as far removed from the original spirit of Glastonbury as it's possible to get. A music festival isn't just about how big the headliners are.. or even about bands at all.. it's about the whole feel, ethos and spirit *man*.

Jeezus, I feel like I've crossed a line into old-fogeydom, but this has just gone too far, and buy into it I will not.

Since there was no landlord, other than the council, I would have paid a fairer rent for this apartment. Not only that, but I would have had a more secure tenancy and would not have been evicted (as I have been recently) whimsically and with minimal notice.

Fine.  There are clearly more of you than me in the UK.  More takers than makers.  Fine.  Keep right on taking, keep right on dictating things that make no fucking sense.

You like it, you and your fellows, and I do not.  I'm not going to start liking it no matter how much you whine.

I'm not going to start agreeing that, yes, individuals are completely incapable of making decisions for themselves and desperately need some big brother government bureaucrat to do it for me.  I'm not.  You want it, fine.  I get it.

I know this, but I also know that you and your fellows are terrified of personal responsibility on any leve what-so-ever.

So I'll just leave you to it.

The only reason Moffat's looks like a series of character moments and Davies's looks like high drama is because Davies didn't let everything go quite so far to shit before people started fixing it, and so when they won they were still in the drama stage. (Oh... and Moffat's version took a paradox to kick off properly. How did the Doctor's screwdriver get out of the Pandorica?)

Last of the Time Lords? Yeah, okay, the Doctor looks like Jesus for a bit and that's kind of rubbish. But the actual plot comes down to this: The Master used Archangel to affect people's thoughts with his technology; the Doctor realizes that can work both ways, and has Martha use Archangel to affect the Master's technology with people's thoughts. The Master used a paradox to cement his dominion over the Earth; the Doctor, once free, reverts the paradox so said dominion never occurred. These solutions aren't coming out of nowhere; they're simply glossed over until the crucial moment because the enemy *rules the fucking world* and it would just be stupid to talk about your plan in those circumstances. Hell, the deleted scenes show us that Martha's scientist friend who brought down the Toclafane was in the Master's pocket all along- he had her kid hostage and used that leverage to learn about the fake gun-in-four-parts plan. If Martha had given any indication of the real plan, the Master could have just shot the satellites out of the sky, and then the universe would be fucked.

&gt; I mean for god's sake, Moffat collapsed all of time and space twice, and those finales felt sedate compared to RTD's finales that only threatened Earth.

Yeah, but is that RTD being over-the-top about threatening the Earth? Or is it Moffat distracting us with fancy boxes and offices on trains while *all of time and space collapses*?",0,1349040019,null,0,false,0,c6fohio,t3_10pbyj,t1_c6fohio,t1_c6fn75h,null,1430030200,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

2. Agility, Balance, Control. Whenever you take on a player (helps if you train yourself to do this subconscious) 

----------------------

* **1st step** agility, engage the player with speed feint direction quickly, 

* **2nd step** as soon as the opposing player switches or loses his balance then you make your move, watch him see which way he's losing his balance and attack the opposite side (watch for opportunities to take the ball through their legs) this should take a split second

* **3rd step** you recover control of the ball and yourself and continue towards goal

You can get to a point where your able to take on **multiple** players at a time and still retain procession but this takes a lot of practice and a high level of all these of those skills 

-----------------------------

you need to work on it and i highly recommend playing against a lot of people (everybody vs everybody (12+ players) if you score you go through, last one to score goes out) this is an amazing game to build all 3 of those skills

No one ever has further interaction with someone after they have been zapped back in time by the weeping angels. River is able to send Amy the manuscript for publishing the book just as the 10th doctor was allowed to tell Billy enough of what was happening (in both timelines) in order to have the TARDIS sent back to him (also with the aid of media publication). These interaction have little to no effect on the individuals initiating the action. __Because it remains a cause-and-effect relationship for the parties involved,__ the paradoxes created by the Doctor and the weeping angels are __self-sustaining.__  

""Why not go pick them up and leave a false headstone?"" Because they wouldn't know what date to go to unless they go back to that date and put it on a fake tombstone. __A fake tombstone would be both a road marker and a product of the journey.__ One could argue the same thing about the folder 10 got from Sally Sparrow, but tht only came out of __one person experiencing the entirety of their portion of the journey__.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"There are two ways to get research funding, promoting your career:

* Work your ass off trying to do the right Science the right way; not because it makes you rich or famous but because you feel it needs to be done and that it will progress the boundaries of human knowledge.

* Or, pointless popular articles that make it into newspapers promoting research that doesn't really need to be done.

The journal mentioned ""Personality and Individual Differences"" wouldn't exactly be on a journalists list of Scientific Journals to read, it doesn't appear to be that low on the list but it's hardly *Nature*, BMJ or Science. Better pieces of research, that could contribute more to the public's understanding of science are put out there every day go ignored but I guess they aren't as exciting average dick sizes. Where is the journalist's sense of integrity? The sense that they have an important role to inform people?

I haven't read the journal article in question; but I'm assuming they didn't fly all over the world measuring men's dicks because getting the funding for this would be damn near impossible. In which case, we already have a good reason for sample bias. If they did get funding to go all over the world I am, genuinely, wondering how *shit* like this actually gets funding. Its downright offensive to all the people I know that want to get PhDs in subjects like Biochemistry but can't get funding because of cuts to research councils and how difficult it is to get a god damn plane ticket to a conference at a university.

If this was about tackling penile cancer or testing something about the anatomy we didn't already know e.g Phimosis (DO NOT GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH; YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED) shows an increase in certain sections of society, it could have public health benefits. Instead, its another piece of work by a cynical self promoting scientist that seeks to investigate the difference between races to argue some thinly veiled, highly speculative selecting factor for evolution that leans dangerously towards social Darwinism. I mean; does anyone genuinely think that the breading between French, German and British people doesn't completely nullify any ""race"" based argument? Does this research tell us anything we didn't already know? ""Black men have bigger penises than white men, who have bigger penises that Asian men"".

I don't like ad-hom attacks because, ultimately science is about data. But the guy in question, Richard Lynn, has argued in the past that the GDP of countries is related to IQ, which got some pretty stern methodological criticism; make up your own mind.

Forget why the research was done though, that doesn't bother me nearly as much as the fact that the Telegraph, a supposedly ""high brow"" newspaper published it.

But the thing that really gets me, and, as someone that cares about science, I can't state this strongly enough: Inches; are you fucking kidding me? What is it? 1950; I suppose we'll use fluid ounces next time we measure drug dosage shall we?

Now how do you know it's intentional?

&gt;What, do you think the government randomly passed this law?

No?  Why would I think that?

&gt;Did you read the article you referenced? Did you read anything it linked to?

I did actually - It referenced a primary source - a magazine from 1907 called Electrical World.  

I assumed it wasn't a government report, because it wasn't.

&gt;I did. Sorry I thought I'd fucking participate fully, but I guess I should have known you are just here to be a government apologist.

What did you read?!?!

&gt; You like it, I don't. I get it. You will make any excuse, ignore any evidence, and read any article with blinders covered by your rose tinted glasses.

No.  I won't ignore any evidence.  How would you know? You haven't provided any.  There are plenty of historical sources surrounding the sinking of the Titanic.  If you think something's inaccurate just find a historical source to back up your claims.  I'm just interested in what works.  Honestly.  I'd get rid of government tomorrow if you could show me it would improve things.  I don't share your emotional attachment to your beliefs; you're projecting.  But you haven't provided any evidence and I've given you plenty. Soooo...

Also you were the one who wanted a ""mission critical"" test. Wifi that doesn't work and TV stations with dodgy reception weren't going to be enough for you.  Stuff the entertainment biz - you needed interference with a ""mission"" - which could seem to imply police or military action.  So you're essentially demanding an example where a serious government action was hindered, knowing full well that you would instantly dismiss any such claims as being government propaganda!  

&gt;Fine. There are clearly more of you than me in the UK. More takers than makers. Fine. Keep right on taking, keep right on dictating things that make no fucking sense. The UK has deteriorated in every single area since the end of WWII and it is primarily due to the fatalist, cry-baby, victim-hood mentality that permeates the culture. You like it, you and your fellows, and I do not. I'm not going to start liking it no matter how much you whine.

Wow - a whole bunch of us and them polemic, chips on shoulders, putting words in the mouths of straw men and then blaming them when the train's late and the paper has a sad story in it.  There's a surprise.  I'm a taker and you're a maker now?  What did you make?  Any of this evidence or rational argument yet?  OK, I'll wait...

&gt;I'm not going to start agreeing that, yes, individuals are completely incapable of making decisions for themselves and desperately need some big brother government bureaucrat to do it for me. I'm not. You want it, fine. I get it.

And now it's a false dichotomy.  Either we abolish all governments or individuals are completely incapable of making any decision? There's a realistic choice!  Any arguments yet?  Any evidence?  Still just straw men?  OK I'll wait...

&gt;But I know, I know, that people, given an opportunity, would be perfectly capable of such pathetically simple things as organizing radio frequency standards, creating health insurance clubs, or taking care of the disabled. I know this, but I also know that you and your fellows are terrified of personal responsibility on any leve what-so-ever.

You *know it* so it's right?  It makes you sad so it's wrong?  Wait a minute... there's not going to be any evidence here at all, is there?  

BTW  If private companies/people did organise radio frequency standards then that implies some kind of standard to break, and there would still be such a thing as pirate radio, and you said before that there shouldn't be...  and what's the penalty for breaking the standards for malicious reasons or personal gain?

I'm unclear on what you're saying.  Just be clear:

Should private entities have exclusive land rights? Yes/No?
Should private entities have exclusive rights to a determined frequencies of electromagnetic spectrum?  Yes/No?

I'm asking questions which you can only evade, put words in my mouth and then have some sort of a mid-life crisis on an internet board.

On a side note, I'm disappointed that fan discussion has stopped being about stuff like ""where would you like to see the Doctor go"" and ""what people could the Doctor meet"" and become so fixated on teasing out the backstory, the minute details of Time Lord history, or bringing back old companions yet again.  

*Doctor Who* is a show where a friendly alien has a space-time machine that can take him and his human friends anywhere in the universe (or out of it) at any time that ever was or will be.  Why not dare to dream?  Why not stretch the imagination?  It doesn't always have to be about the machinations of obscure Time Lord history all the time!

Ok my real answer..
I honestly don't think there is much trickery involved here at all.

There's definitely some timey-wimey stuff happening, but my personal opinion is that the episodes took place in order, from the Ponds'/Williams' pov.
During the 7 weeks in tPoT, some of the things like Amy marrying the king and Rory/the Doctor losing the charger happened, but that all took place in the course of tPoT.
As for the Doctor's pov, he went back and started visiting Amy and Rory after they left him in tATM.
So basically the same timeline, except that everything the took place before tATM was after that episode for the Doctor, while the Ponds' were going through it for the first time.

iow for Amy and Rory, it all happened in order, but for the Doctor, tATM was a prequel to everything that happened before it. (and the little bits we wonder about happened during the 7 weeks in tPoT.)

As for the queen comment in DoaS, Amy just said she was a queen because that's the answer that Amy would give to another queen. And let's face it...

Go to any other subreddit, r/coys or gunners. Go see what they say about us. Did you do any reading in the Spurs subreddit when we knocked them out of the CL in May? Evidently not.

Being a ""true"" fan doesn't mean hating all of the other clubs, but if you can't handle trash talk you probably shouldn't read comment sections in match threads. 

I don't want to speak for everyone here, but I think everyone likes to be fired up before a game and if that means the top comment has someone making fiery rhetoric by referring to Spurs as Bottomham, or hoping that AVB's tenure with them is as short as it is unsuccessful, or calling Arsenal a bunch of ivory tower European-trophyless cunts than so be it. It's better than some milky pragmatism hoping that we have a decent game with lots of trys.

I don't have a problem with other teams in a sense. I recognize that they exist, that they also play football, and that some of their players are objectively good at what they do. I also think that players that are threats to us winning a game are brought up in threads - who needs to be shut down etc... And scouting prospects from other teams are not unfamiliar in the transfer rumour threads.

But am I going to respect Arsenal, or Spuds, or United, or Scouse, or anyone else?

It's obviously season 7, but there must be something else underlying behind it.. it's too apparent to just be a simple tribute. 
I am currently of the opinion that it's a subtle hint about the upcoming 50th anniversary.. 7 seasons, 3 doctors.. Power of three... something like that.

That said, I'll be pretty upset if Paul McGann and Sylvester McCoy aren't involved in the upcoming special. (along with as many other surviving Doctors as possible) 

All I know for sure is next year is going to be a great year to be a Doctor Who fan! :)

Some days are so, so blessed. Some days, nobody dies at all. Now and then, every once in a very long while, every day in a million days, when the wind stands fair, and the Doctor comes to call... everybody lives.

The Doctor can't just nonchalantly travel with someone he knows is going to spend a year in the body of a Dalek.

Also, I just had a thought. Alex Kingston (River Song) is going to be getting older. The Doctor's just going to keep on regenerating. She said something about ""not letting The Doctor see the scars"" in The Angels Take Manhattan. Oswin is a very similar character. Maybe River's going to get her regenerations back.
