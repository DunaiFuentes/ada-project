Currently, the policies are [under a process of regeneration](http://www.reddit.com/r/policy2011) to incorporate a full platform, but you can read our current set of policies here in [PDF](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/media/uploads/manifesto2011/uk/UK_Final_Low.pdf)|[RTF](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/media/uploads/manifesto2011/uk/UK_Final.rtf)|[HTML](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policies/uk-2011/message/)

I hope that sheds some light on some of our policies - though as I say, there are currently working groups, working on our new policy platform covering everything from education to defence.

But, should you **join** the pirate party movement? 

Well, that's not really a question I can answer for you. :)

Had this not been a two-legged affair, we would have (in all likelihood) lost to Barcelona 2-1. Considering we only had 10 men, that's still not a bad result. 

That being said, I think you're being a little too overconfident. Liverpool have owned us all year long (beating us at Stamford Bridge twice, one of which was knocking us out of the CC). I agree with OP that this was due in large part to the efforts of Lucas, who is a wall in front of the back 4. 

As far as who I'm concerned about, it is obviously Suarez. Liverpool live and die by his contributions. He is their spark, and when contained, the reds grow very stagnant. Aside from him, Pepe Reina will be a major factor. He's had an average year, but I still consider him to be one of the best keepers in the BPL when on his A game. 

At the risk of sounding too cocky, Chelsea really should win this game. We have the better side, and far more quality and depth in our Forwards, midfield and defense.

It's like in the standard model of particle physics, gauge fields permeate spacetime and mediate the interactions of subatomic particles.  Like how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. The TARDIS just adds some new fields and these fields are ""smart"" enough so that the movements of the atoms in response to someone speaking an alien language interact with the field which interacts with the atoms, changing their vibrations to match the target language.

The fact is, plain and simple, Chelsea FC existing is at the whim of Abramovich. If a bigger, more luxurious stadium is what he wants to keep him paying our ridiculous wage bill and getting us to the point of being and to break even and pay down our debts so we won't need Roman, then I am all for it. Furthermore, as it stands now and in the conceivable future, we have zero chance, zero hope of breaking even. Chelsea fans like to point and laugh at Arsenal fans for bleating about how good their finances are in lieu of trophies, but if Roman were to leave or we suffered heavily from the loss of CL football. We wouldn't have trophy winning seasons to keep our heads up, we wouldn't even have decent squads we could trot out. 

We would be in dire, dire straits and anyone who is willing to accept that possibility simply does not have the best interests of the club in their heart.

If your concern is more seats &gt; more revenue &gt; more expensive players just so that the team can win win win, you may want to rethink you position. We're already out earning most, so when FFP does kick in we can spend more than most.

true,con-vexation,null,null,"Yeah, I'm familiar with Gabe's statement, and I see it represented in both the music and book mediums you have mentioned. There are many good websites that sell DRM-free music at very low prices (79-99p a track for 320 or higher audio on places like Boomkat, Juno etc.), and books are sold cheap on Amazon, with pleasant customer service and free P&amp;P.

I have to say, it sounds very hyperbolic to suggest that a 'healthy' album collection costs 10k, and it's not as if it is a one off down payment? Hardbacks generally don't cost £15 if you buy from the places that actually offer that kind of service which Gabe talks about. In gaming, countless online sales and places like savygamer, /r/gamedeals, /r/patientgamers help too.

To clarify, I don't see pirates as criminals in order to be punished, but I feel the arguments are dubious and at times downright rationalisations or justifications. At the end of the day, I'm not going to tell people whether they should feel bad or not about pirating, especially when I'm in a position where I don't need to pirate and there is certainly no quantifiable evidence to show that piracy directly impacts sales. (Okay, this is increasingly developing into fence-sitting, oops).

I will go back somewhat, however. Old works where the author is no longer alive and would not be compensated, or simply works that are just unavailable by others means are fair-play.

For me it is a point of principle. How can information be 'owned'? I find it absurd that I could take a sequence of notes or words and deny others the use for a life time (plus 70 is it?). We don't need copyright, imagine if Marlowe couldn't use Faustus, Shakespeare had denied others the use of the words he invented, or Pythagoras had kept his algorithms private.

Really good artists that need the money will get the support of people who genuinely deserved the 'reward', where as mass produced churn like Gaga or ... (I just realised I haven't a clue what the 'kids' listen to these days) I would hope be treated like the disposable trash it is. No one should be able to spend an hour on the laptop and make a million off the back of such little effort, so that would be my other criticism: copyright and patents aid inequality.

A year on earth is the rotation of the earth around the sun.  It's highly unlikely that Gallifrey has the exact same rotation time around it's sun.  It's quite possible a Gallifrey Year is 100 Earth Years.

I think jimmysilverrims makes a good point that he probably has just forgot, or doesn't want to admit, but it might be more to the point that it would be impossible to calculate, since he is always on different planets, each with different lengths of days/years. He could spend 1 day on Earth, which could equal 1 minute on Gallifrey, then pop over to Rexicoricusphallivatorius for another day, which could be 1 hour on Gallifrey.  Meaning he just spent 2 ""days"" on two different planets, but since their days are shorter than a Gallifrey day, it was only 1 hour and 1 minute toward his age.  I think this would make it extremely difficult for him to judge his age since each planet will have different lengths to their days.  And since we learned in the ""Night and the Doctor"" specials, the Doctor doesn't sleep (at least not as often as humans), so it would be hard for him to judge day lengths by his exhaustion like humans can do on earth.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"I commented on this the other day (check my comment history), but basically it boils down to three realistic possibilities:

1) He was murdered because of something he knew i.e. something work related that he shouldn't have come across.  Unlikely as I'd have thought MI6 would be componentised to some degree, enough to ensure things like this didn't happen

2) He was murdered due to something in his personal life.  He maybe had a secret lover who was also a spook, and they had some kind of tiff which got out of hand.  The murder is covered up as there is just no way something like that can ever reach the papers or courts as it would be a huge scandal and possible national security risk.  The bizarre crime scene was left as a means of keeping people guessing without revealing too much or making it look *too* suspicious, but why leave the body?  Why not just remove it when the crime scene was tampered with and cleaned up?

3) An unknown third-party bumped him off because of something he knew or had worked on.  MI6 didn't kill him, but they know why he was killed as well as who did it and it has to be covered up for that reason.  Others in this thread have said this and it seems likely given the circumstances r.e. his phone and laptop.

There has been speculation he was murdered because he was hellbent on leaving MI6 and going back to GCHQ, which is apparently a total no-no due to the difference in security clearances and information you are privy to.

It's almost definitely murder unless it's a really kinky sex game which went wrong but not maliciously or deliberately, an extension of point 2.  Again, something like that would be covered up and obfuscated.

The only thing about this which is obvious and certain is that we will never know the whole truth.  That, and MI6 know the truth but it's hushed up and probably for very good reason.",0,1336013913,null,0,false,0,c4jgeis,t3_t3iwk,t1_c4jgeis,t3_t3iwk,null,1428845771,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I think the real difference is that unlike Mickey, Rory sort of sets himself up for failure by so completely and selflessly attaching himself to Amy. Mickey obviously cared about Rose, but you never got the level of total devotion (or total disregard for such loyalty) from Rose and Mickey's relationship.

Additionally, where Rory has married Amy and is still in many ways commanded by her, Rory became independent and ended up with someone who respected him *and* operated as an equal badass.

DOCTOR: I see. That’s a very interesting concept.

GUARD: Personally, I find most experiences border on the existential.

DOCTOR: Well, how do you reconcile that with the empirical critical belief that experience is at the root of all phenomena?

GUARD: I think you’ll find that a concept can be philosophically valid even if theologically meaningless.

DOCTOR: So, what you’re saying is that before Plato existed, someone had to have the idea of Plato.

GUARD: Oh, you’ve no idea what a relief it is for me to have such a stimulating philosophical discussion. There are so few intellectuals about these days. Tell me, what do you think of the assertion that the semiotic thickness of a performed text varies according to the redundancy of auxiliary performance codes?

With both central midfield and striker we have a lot of options but Im not sure How many can cut it in the PM. Schneiderlin and cork will in a few years but next season will be a big test.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, that is the quirk I am referring to, that EU law does not apply to internal borders.  You may not funding is a good idea, but a large number of people do, and it would be under threat if it was opened up without restriction.  The result would essentially be the Scottish taxpayer paying for English and Welsh residents to get the benefit of free fees whilst the tax payers back home were able to have the money used for some other purpose, while still getting the benefit.  There's no way that that is equitable either.

I agree that it's discriminatory (although on residence, not nationality) but I think it has to be otherwise we are dragged down to the level of England and Wales as well.  All of the free movement provisions within the EU are tempered by derogations for public policy anyway, there are situations where discriminations is seen as a necessary evil.  Scotland's is a pretty unique situation within the EU anyway, I think - a small country with free/low tuition next door to a far larger country, with the same language and high tuition fees.  I don't think anyone had English and Welsh students usurping Scottish ones in heir minds when it was implemented.

If the policy is ever forced to change (say on independence) then I can see a situation being put in place where the Scottish government, instead of paying the fees, gives a ""fees grant"" to students, equivalent to Scottish fees but usable wherever.  Similar grants are available in other EU countries so there would be no problem with it and it would achieve pretty much the same goals.  I just think it is sad that it would come to that, and that people would try to beat or destroy our system instead of trying to change theirs, if provision of fees is what they are after (although I realise that numerous protests show that people are indeed attempting to do that).",0,1336035345,null,0,false,0,c4jjord,t3_t1j4b,t1_c4jjord,t1_c4jfvjd,null,1428847317,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

You're confusing an empirical claim with an ethical one. Please don't do that. It doesn't help anyone.

Suppose I spend all my disposable income on buying games. Suppose I then pirate a few more. (In reality I play very few games and never pirate any of them, but this is a hypothetical). I am engaged in piracy, but I can't possibly be costing anyone money - all the money I could have spent on games I already have. Suppose one of the games I pirated I say to a friend ""Hey this game is awesome! You should play it!"" and they then buy the game. My piracy has now not only not decreased sales but actually increased them.

The reality is of course more nuanced than this example (but the example is not completely without realism - this sort of thing does happen), but it illustrates the point: It is at least in principle possible to pirate without causing any damage to sales. 

There's then a separate question of whether it's ethical to do. This question is complex and I don't know the right answer to it. But by making it a black and white issue and saying ""It's evil because it costs jobs!"" without the data to back it up you are actually making a convincing argument *for* piracy, because people will conflate the empirical claim with the ethical one and will go ""Well if it doesn't really cost jobs it must be ok for me to pirate, and there's no convincing evidence that it costs jobs, therefore yay free downloads!""",0,1336037775,null,0,false,0,c4jjvi5,t3_t3opr,t1_c4jjvi5,t1_c4jit8d,null,1428847400,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,menuselect,null,null,"Flying can be cheaper but you will need to add the cost of getting two and from the air port to the city center. Also you will spend a long time going through security and checking bags etc. I would fly from Glasgow to Belfast and Belfast to London. But not bother with other flights as once you add the cost of getting to and from the airport the price difference is not worth the time. Glasgow to Edinburgh takes 1 hour by train and costs £12 and takes you from center to center.  Not sure if its cheaper but if you are real on a budget you could do Glasgow Central to Belfast Central takes a lot longer 7h15 so most likely best to get a flight for this (although the Rail Sail can be got for £45 so could still be cheaper if your on a tight budget) If you decided to go anywhere else say like Manchester, Bristol or Bath etc get the train. Just buy your tickets in advance and they are cheap.

For things to do in London on the cheap check out http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/645/cheap-london I would also visit the museums &amp; galleries most of which are free (National History, Tate Britain, National Gallery etc).

For cheap drinks checkout sam smiths pubs they are quite nice and many are in good locations http://fancyapint.com/Pub/london/the-chandos/1054 The Chandos is a good one. http://fancyapint.com is good for finding pubs.

I would recommend an trip out to Richmond (its about 40 mins on the train out of London Waterloo) and is very nice especially on a sunny day you can have a drink down near the river. There is also a very good pub there for food Pig's Ears Beer Cellar. Also well worth heading out to Greenwich. For nights out on the cheap you can checkout Kings collage student club (http://www.kclsu.org/landing.asp?section=113&amp;sectionTitle=Tutu%27s+Nightclub ) its cheap as hell and has a great view over the Thames.

Looking at other small ISPs, I can expect to pay roughly the same, just for the connection. I'd then have line rental on top, which effectively prices them out of the market.

Even looking at individual pricing, a large number of the smaller ISPs can't come anywhere near matching the price, let alone matching the connection speed and zero-limits.

But enough of the ""oh woes is my wallet"". Services-wise, low contention, high download limits, or even possibly no download limits out of peak hours. As little shaping as possible, obviously during peak time you expect a little QOS, but nothing that'll kill a download.

The one problem that I do see is redirecting traffic through the VPN to another ISPs connection.

The other problem, specifically with external ATMs, is that without reviewing CCTV footage, you can't prove either way that the fake note came from your ATM. There's a real possibility that someone could make a withdrawal, then come into the branch with the fake note, claiming that it came from the external ATM.

Suarez causes any team problems, and Maxi seems to like scoring against us this season. That being said, I think we'll win.

piklwikl, I am not about to debate with you, it is utterly pointless as you are uncapable of understanding anything even when it is explained to you time and time again. Your arguments lack credibility, structure, source, and when shown up to be flawed you resort by insulting others. 

&gt;I see since I debated 'searine' - well-known GMO ag industry shill for reddit - a few days ago that all my comments now quickly get many down-votes. I supplied peer reviewed papers and other credible sources but reddit 'scientists' mass down-voted my comments to try and hide the evidenec -- http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rf95t/what_is_the_current_scientific_consensus_on/c4fr9xy

Hahaha you call that a debate? Searine in NOT an industry shill, and by claiming that they are you prove my point that you cannot effectively discuss anything without resorting to insult.  I am sorry we 'massed' to hide the evidence? perhaps when you provide something credible then you would not get downvoted. 

Actually yes let have a proper look at that thread, and your comments in it accusing Searine of being an industry shill when you have no evidence to say that whatsoever. Oh and I believe you threw in the insult of scumbag too.  What you have a bee in your bonnet over is that Searine asked the AskSciencePanel to review the answers, just to make sure there was nothing amiss and the answers were good quality, which they were. The asksciencepanel is full of scientists from mixed fields, not all 'shills' as you call them, and some good environmentalists in there too. If there was anything wrong with the answers Searine gave, you would have known about it. 

I find it hilarious when people like you blame some inner conspiracy for being downvoted, when in fact it is the garbage you spout that gets you the downvotes.

So first you say no-one should be able to make money on trash, while admitting you don't actually know anything about said 'trash'. FWIW, Lady Gaga is a trained pianist turned pop artist. I don't know what your skill threshold is, but by most people's, she would pass. Luckily, you aren't the arbiter of what's good enough and what isn't, eh?

How would you define 'pop music' anyway? Just the stuff you don't like? People that sell a lot of records? Some of the best musicians in history have sold a lot of records, _because they're the best musicians in history_, and thus are 'pop stars'.

&gt; No one should be able to spend an hour on the laptop and make a million off the back of such little effort

Why the hell not? Who are you to say otherwise? If someone can spend an hour on a laptop (and forgive me for thinking less of you for being ignorant, but even the trashiest pop songs take a lot more effort than you're giving them credit for), and other people are prepared to pay £5, £10, perhaps even more for it, what gives you the moral authority to decree that isn't OK?


What this comes down to is you don't like some 'stuff', and so you want to deny everyone else the right to conduct a transaction for said 'stuff' based on an opinion that it's not worthy enough.

No they aren't.  They're the most vocal antagonists of *software patents*, which are a very tiny fraction of ""intellectual property"".  You don't even understand the field enough to know the difference between copyright, which is broken when you download software from PirateBay, and software patents which are something completely different, and are related to the actual implementation of software.

Good for him.  As he wrote it, he can choose what to do with it.  Your suggestion is that the freedom of content creators to decide how their creations are distributed should be taken away from them by people who want something for nothing.

&gt; You people have done it again. Show me the data.

Let's run through this:

  * Software house Y pay team of hundreds of developers to develop product X.
  * Product X is pirated to fuck by people who cannot see that not actually paying for software that costs millions to develop is detrimental to the business.
  * More and more children pirate product X until it becomes unprofitable to spend any more than Z amount in developing software.
  * Software developers lose their jobs, or software houses push for completely closed systems with DRM built into the hardware, cryptographic certificates needed to run programs, etc. because criminals have completely undermined honest business.

Incorrect. To support the argument that piracy harms the creative industries it is necessary to demonstrate that the net effect of piracy is pathological. For every hypothetical or real lost sale, there may well be real sales generated through illegal sharing, whether it be direct purchases or secondary consumerism regarding attendance to live performance and related merchandise.

I am not denying the money side,  the  sarcasm in my post is aimed specifically at the posters ludicrous statements. Problem factory implied first off that other people would suffer because money is not spend on them, and then went on to suggest that if people were not forced by legislation to buy a defib, that they would therefore put money into extra taxes for the NHS or for better seatbelts in cars.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; So first you say no-one should be able to make money on trash, while admitting you don't actually know anything about said 'trash'. FWIW, Lady Gaga is a trained pianist turned pop artist.

So she sold out then? When I say trash I mean trash, this type of music is mostly shortlived, cynical profiteering, and an utterly disposable cultural product usually forgotten outside the contemporary generation (if not by the next month). I may not know what the current heavily manufactured artists are, but that has nothing to do with copyright. I've stepped on your personal taste and you've reacted badly, that's a shame. 

&gt; How would you define 'pop music' anyway? Just the stuff you don't like? People that sell a lot of records? Some of the best musicians in history have sold a lot of records, because they're the best musicians in history, and thus are 'pop stars'.

Why do I need to define pop music? We are talking copyright here not volume of sales.

&gt; Why the hell not? Who are you to say otherwise? If someone can spend an hour on a laptop (and forgive me for thinking less of you for being ignorant, but even the trashiest pop songs take a lot more effort than you're giving them credit for), and other people are prepared to pay £5, £10, perhaps even more for it, what gives you the moral authority to decree that isn't OK?

Often for the artists own sake: the human ego doesn't seem strong enough to cope with the indulgences enabled by the money and fame (just look what has happened to Michael Jackson, if only people had denied him the obscene wealth he might not have mutilated himself and fiddled with many a boy in a warped juvenile theme park of his own making). However, a litany of rhetorical questions doesn't make for the most convincing of arguments, especially when they are attacking the person rather than the words. I mentioned that because many proponents of intellectual property (you included) like to crudely devalue cultural artefacts to financialised commodities to be bought and sold, and push a sense of 'unfairness' claiming a moral authority derived by some misplaced justification regarding 'their own hard work'. It is often not the case. If we look to examples like Cliff Richard and Disney who are still receiving royalty payments for 'work' done in the 50s, we see how intellectually property enables a lack of work and innovation through a lazy monetisation of previous effort.

&gt; What this comes down to is you don't like some 'stuff', and so you want to deny everyone else the right to conduct a transaction for said 'stuff' based on an opinion that it's not worthy enough.

What it comes down to is me not liking the ring fencing of culture, inequality, abuse of the legal system, the criminalisation of (usually children) sharing information, and a very wealthy rentier class dictating and deny what can and can't be done with and over what are intrinsically communal efforts. Any construct of words or music has at least a few thousand years of shared culture to defer ownership to.

&gt; Forgive me for making assumptions, but you appear to have the opinions of someone that's never produced anything worth anything to anyone. Otherwise, you might understand the concept of being fairly compensated for your material.

If you produce culture and expect 'compensation' then you deserve neither. I'm going to throw this latest ad hominem attack right back: you appear to have the opinions of someone that's never produced anything that has made them want to share with the whole world. You also seem like a person who would know very little  nothing of the first applications of intellectual property.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You chose to argue from a crude financialised economic stand point, yet you are not following its rules, or those of argument. If you can included hypothetical lost sales (because you can never know for certain whether one instance of copying would have been a purchase otherwise), I get to include the real and hypothetical generated sales unrestricted copying would entail. I can invert you argument: that piracy may occasionally have nebulous, impossible to measure negative effects, yadda, yadda. That would be the flawed form of argument, and now to the economic morality:

Basically you are saying that unrestricted copying is a drain on the economy, lost money, lost jobs. Let us consider we find that technology related to copying (printing presses, film cameras, VHS, gramophones, DVD writers, harddrives, 3D printers, internet connections). For their to be a 'immoral' economic effect, we need to take into account all net utility generated by an activity. If as a whole the economy functions better with unrestricted copying through more jobs say in the technological sector, or a faster rate of innovation in sectors like medicine, even if the creative industry shrank as long as there was a net gain it has to be seen as a moral good from a purely economic vantage. However, as the data shows the creative industry is expanding.

Like I said show me the hard data of how the creative industries are in peril from unrestricted copying. Then show me the same for the the invention of writing, the printing press, the gramophone, the tape recorder, the video recorder, the CD, the DVD, and the internet.

If this legislation means that they have to have a certain amount in every public building by law, that's something that comes from our pockets.

How much do these machines cost, who makes them (are they pushing for this too) and how many will need to be ordered to comply with a change in the law for public buildings?

&gt; you appear to have the opinions of someone that's never produced anything that has made them want to share with the whole world

On the contrary, I produce something. I love sharing it with the world. But if I didn't get paid fairly for it, I wouldn't be able to do it. Call me a salesman if you like, but it's a simple fact - money facilitates culture. If people don't pay for the work of others, there's less room for culture all around.

Overwhelmingly, the people that create culture are the ones that want to protect it from freeloaders. It's the freeloaders - the ones who don't create anything, and just take it - who have the ideals of everyone sharing. It's not surprising that the people who work hard to create something (whether you approve it or not) want to be paid fairly for it. Label those people 'salesmen' and take them away, and you aren't left with much culture. Only what people can put together in their spare time.

Take almost any piece of well-known historical culture, and you'll discover money facilitated it. Ancient sculptures? Paid for by rich nobility. Great paintings? Typically commissioned by someone. Yes, people like creating stuff, but stuff can only be created in useful quantities and qualities when it is paid for. This isn't a modern phenomenon. 

&gt; When I say trash I mean trash, this type of music is mostly shortlived, cynical profiteering, and an utterly disposable cultural product

People said that about the Beatles when they started. 

&gt; If we look to examples like Cliff Richard and Disney who are still receiving royalty payments for 'work' done in the 50s

Again - why shouldn't they? Cliff Richard is still alive. Why should he not be paid for work he did, even if it was years ago? For companies it's a little different, because they don't 'die', so some timeframe has to be decided upon. On this point I'll agree with you - 70 years (or whatever it is) is too long. But I disagree that copyright as a thing is wrong. People deserve to be able to earn a good living (and by good living, I mean 'however much they can' - not some arbitrary 'that's enough' limit that I imagine you would suggest) from their work. You don't deserve to get it free because you would like it for free.

&gt; …[t]hat's a whole lot of imposing your own moral code on everyone else.

You can 'take almost any piece of well-known historical culture, and you'll discover' it wouldn't have been possible without prior shared collective works - unrestricted copying is essential to innovation and culture.

&gt; This isn't a modern phenomenon.

I am afraid it is. The idea of intellectual property only came about because the masses got hold of technology of mass production (the printing press is the key historical event here, you should go look it up). To add, Shakespeare and the wider *Renaissance* seemed to do quite well without the protection of intellectual property.

&gt; Again - why shouldn't they?

Again - why should they? (You haven't taken my advice regarding rhetorical questions have you?) If they didn't have the 'protection' of highly convoluted state mandated artificial censorship mechanisms they likely wouldn't 'deserve' the obscene amounts they manage to hoover up. However, I expect those that care for the culture to still support it as crudely as monetarily. Not many have homes big enough for a house sized projector, nor can the fun of a live performance be copied well over the internet.

&gt; People said that about the Beatles when they started.

I'm not talking about the Beatles, but I'll have a go: they might well just be the epitome of the manufactured boyband.

&gt; For companies it's a little different, because they don't 'die', so some timeframe has to be decided upon.

Do you find that a logical construct that doesn't exist (the company) can claim 'ownership' of something else that doesn't exist (intellectual property), so we have to introduce yet more logical constructs that don't exist (laws) to solve a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place, isn't all a bit much?

Talking of…

&gt; some arbitrary 'that's enough' limit

…isn't that what you just advocated?

No, telling others what the can copy, what they can sing, what the can read...

true,thebuggalo,null,null,"I can't speak for everyone, but from what I've seen, generally people suggest you start with Season 5 because it's the point in the the New series where a whole new crew took over. New Doctor, new cast, new writers, new everything. It continues the same story right where the past 4 seasons left off, but it's essentially a new ""start"".

I say ""start"" because it's not really a starting point.  It's just the start of this Doctor, and I suspect a lot of people suggest starting there because you will be caught up to them in terms of knowing the twists/turns of Season 5 and 6 faster than if you went through 6 full seasons.  That way you can discuss what is going on in the show now while you catch up on the old stuff.  However, I feel like that is more for their benefit than yours.

It doesn't benefit you to miss out on the journey the Doctor has taken.  It doesn't benefit you to just watch the best episodes and skip the others. People suggest watching Season 5 and 6 first, so you will be ""caught up"" and then going back to watch their favorite episodes.  However you won't be ""caught up"", you might actually be MORE confused, since you won't know certain things. They will mention things that you might not understand, but for people who have watched the show, it's a powerful reference to something else that makes an episode that much more enjoyable.

People may suggest skipping Season 1 because of the production values. It was made in 2005, so by today's standards it looks dated. It was also made on a much smaller budget than later seasons. There are some cheesy effects, and cheesy stories, which might turn off some viewers, but if you stick with it there are AMAZING episodes in Season 1. Christopher Eccleston only did 13 episodes, but his performance has stuck with me still. They say you will always remember your first Doctor, and he did a great job at introducing the world of Doctor Who to me. It's the natural place to start, and it brings you up to speed with everything at a great pace.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with Doctor Who and I don't want to ruin anything, because going in as blind as possible will make it so much more enjoyable.  I will just say, in the first episode, there is a scene where Rose first steps inside the Tardis.  And I didn't even know what a Tardis was when I first started watching, so the reveal of what it was and how it worked was incredible to me.  In later seasons, it's not as cinematic and beautifully revealed as it was in the first episode, because they assume people watching already know about it and move on. Ruining little surprises like that by starting at later seasons will make the show a little less magical, in my opinion.

On the surface, most episodes are one-off stories (with a few plot points to move forward the overall season-long plot) which you *could* hop around between.  But I personally feel like that robs you of what makes the show so great. Those little hints about the plot, and those references to past episodes make the universe of Doctor Who come to life in a way that won't happen for you if you watch it out of order.

Jumping between different Doctors, and different companions who you haven't been introduced to will make the story more confusing and could possibly diminish the enjoyment you find from them.  For example, ""Blink"" is commonly praised as one of the best episodes of Doctor Who.  It's in the second half of Season 3. Without knowing what has come before that, I suspect the episode would lose some of it's luster. It would be like watching The Empire Strikes Back first, just because it's called the best of the trilogy. It's the best of the trilogy because A New Hope set up the pieces for you. Without having the pieces set up the episode will not have the same effect. The people who suggest just watching the best episodes seem to forget (or just don't care) that those episodes are great alongside the full seasons. That without the proper introduction of previous episodes, the ""great"" episodes mean nothing.

And who knows what episodes you would like.  I really really enjoyed a two-part episode called, ""The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit"". I don't see it on a lot of lists of great episodes, but it was powerful to me and one I consider to be in my top 5 episodes. Conversely, a lot of people enjoyed ""Amy's Choice"" but I wasn't a big fan of it. It's just a matter of opinion, so decide for yourself.

Season 7 doesn't start until the Fall, and every season is on Netflix. It shouldn't take too long to go through the series in the order it was made.  And now is the time.  With the 50th Anniversary coming up in 2013, you will want to be as caught up as possible. Don't cheat yourself out of the impact of great episodes by skipping ahead.

&gt;The weapons have been blamed for 17 deaths in Northern Ireland, although the weapon has since been redesigned in an attempt to make it safer.

&gt;But Mr McConomy, who has campaigned against the weapons, said: ""My understanding is that the current baton rounds actually have a higher velocity than the previous ones.

It's an interesting point but 

a) my understanding was that it's not the gun that needs to be accurate but the plastic bullet itself (which I had thought was supposed to be fired at the floor and rebound rather than be fired directly, but I could very well be very wrong there); and 

b) I still wouldn't trust it and do not like the militarisation of our domestic police force.

This would be a better post if I'd just kept to b) there I think.

There was no requirement to specifically log all access attempts either as requesting the website is not illegal in the slightest. This is the ISP we're talking about here, not the evil gubberments. There's been recent legislation over ISP storing of website requests for a period of time but at the bare minimum authorities would require a warrant or subpoena to view anything. That is not 'surveillance'.

&gt;It's actually an economic reality. Consider how your mobile phone company knows every call and text made, nearest mobile tower, and recipient. Consider how already your ISP is able to quantify all internet traffic and bill you accordingly. Consider how your bank has a record of every financial transaction (outside of third party cash exchanges) ever made. Consider how for a modern 1TB hard drive might be able to hold all the data you've ever produced over a life time (if discount video). Google is already providing enough online hosting for all your emails which are only a court order a way. Tech such as Twitter and Reddit is managing the conversation of millions.

You just proved there how it's a nigh-on economic impossibility. Your mobile phone company may know where your phone calls were coming from over the last month and for how long, but they couldn't possibly store the conversations, and anything they do store would be erased after a short period because they can't store that much data (and have no reason to).

&gt;Consider how for a modern 1TB hard drive might be able to hold all the data you've ever produced over a life time (if discount video). 

Nowhere near. You could use 1TB worth of bandwidth in a matter of months.

Besides, all these are individual industries which spend tens of millions on data storage alone, and again store the bare minimum and for the least amount of time possible.

&gt; 'Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.'

The same works for IP where if you give up freedom for the monetisation of static information and culture, or for economic gain, you will get neither freedom (obviously) but you won't get culture or good economics either. We are stuck with monolithic companies who like to rent the populous their own culture. I used Gaga as it was the first example I could think of that I felt represented artificial skin-deep culture (but this of course is subjective so insert your own example: Take That, Boyzone, Spice Girls, X-Factor?).

Elsewhere we are stuck with companies like Microsoft and Oracle that inhibit innovation in computing (if you want a recent example look to Oracle vs Google with is in the courts right now). We also come to the point where governments under the guise of copyright enforcement get to push tax payer money into highly controversial internet surveillance and censorship technology.

Culture is a shared medium of everything powered by the constant cross pollination of everything else. Intellectual property would be the antithesis, mandating a certain artefact is private, owned and it may not change or be reproduced thereafter (give or take one hundred years). Something as static as intellectual property has no place in such a seething mass of creativity. Ideas work very much like biology, you have mimicry, evolution, and devolution, in one giant unrestrained collaboration. Such a system would break down if one organism gained the ability to patent the lung or the eyeball, which in essence entails a claim of ownership heavily dependent on the 'work' and 'innovation' of previous proto-species. Should that mean that all other organisms must run around blind?

I am not pro-piracy, I am pro-freedom and innovation; the most advancement for the most people.

RTD confirmed this somewhat in *A Writer's Tale* when he points out that while the Doctor and Rose are indeed selfish with regards to each other, that line (among others) is a hint that maybe Mr. Mickey wasn't that great of a boyfriend, either. 

He also repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to let Rose deal with potentially dangerous situations on her own: Your girlfriend might be meeting with an internet nutter? Sit in the car and let her go into his house on her own. He wanted her to abandon the Doctor to his doom, clung to her like a child (he's the older one!) and ran for the nearest hiding place when he, the Doctor and Rose were ambushed outside the TARDIS in ""Aliens of London"".

These censorship systems do not currently implement a Man-In-The-Middle attack against the SSL services offered by our web server. It is not much of a stretch of the imagination to think that such an action may be a future plan; we've seen it elsewhere.](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tale-new-censors-vodafone-uk-t-mobile-uk-o2-uk-and-t-mobile-usa)

It way not be the method in this case, but it shows there's much more to worry about than DNS tampering.

&gt; There was no requirement to specifically log all access attempts either as requesting the website is not illegal in the slightest.

It could be argued as contempt of court. But if 'they' know you accessed the piratebay 'they' also must have the means to be able to identify the source. It also follows that if technology can block one request type 'they' can do it for any. The examples given are there to show the surveillance capabilities that are in play at present.

&gt; It just knows how much data you've been requesting, not the actual content.

For the most part an URL is as good as content because they can go look it up, but more important is the connection of end-points. If you didn't watch democracynow you would have heard a former NSA employee talking about the storing of data:

Those would be edge cases, but discounting binary data, a reasonably modern home computer can already store your entire families viewing history, emails, homework, spreadsheets, IM conversations, and 90 gigs of space is enough to hold perhaps two months worth of continuous audio at a low byte rate (I checked my iTunes and found a 1.7 gig to be 18 hours continuous playback at 320).

true,Limes19,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; This is unproven. I can keep saying it if you want, but unless you have some serious data to back it up, then it's just guessing.

So is ""it could hit a tower block and kill more people""! How is our conversation based on anything other than conjecture right now? All I can say is that in many other instances of planes crashing in built up areas, the death toll on the ground was low. If we compare the result of scenarios where the pilot did not intend to crash, or did not have control of the area of ground that was hit (comparable to a shot down plane):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mexico_City_plane_crash
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_New_York_City_plane_crash
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockerbie

With the result of a scenario in which the pilot did have control of the area that was hit and did intend to inflict maximum damage (comparable to letting the plane continue unmolested):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11

&gt; It entirely depends on how much of the stadium is hit, compared to a tower block. A low impact on a tower block (of offices, lets say) could lead to a fire trapping everyone above. A plane strike on a stadium could hit one stand, and nothing else.
What's the probabilities of this? I don't know. Do you?

Sure. The plane *could* crash into the Thames and miss everyone, too. The plane *could* plow into the stands and cause a collapse of the entire structure, killing thousands. You can come up with these ideas all day. What you cannot do, however, is to think of the worst scenario you can for a shot-down plane, compare it to the best scenario you can think of for an untouched plane, and use that as an argument for not shooting it down.

We have to therefore look at what is statistically *likely* to happen. The way I see it, the best way to do this is to compare the density of people in each likely impact zone.

This has been my point since I started posting in this thread!  This point, and no other.

&gt; What you cannot do, however, is to think of the worst scenario you can for a shot-down plane, compare it to the best scenario you can think of for an untouched plane, and use that as an argument for not shooting it down.

Good job I didn't do that then.

&gt; We have to therefore look at what is statistically likely to happen. The way I see it, the best way to do this is to compare the density of people in each likely impact zone.

No, because that assumes that the probability of impact is identical per unit area.

It might be bad but stop, count to 5, compose yourselves, and proceed.  For the love of Jehovah, or Jupiter, or whoever, people, we're not Americans.

First of all private companies, contractors and civilians have been working for the UK police for decades now.  That's right.  Decades.  The grey, perfidious sky is not falling in on your heads.  If that's your opinion, it already fell a long time ago.

Second of all, everybody has the ability to detain anybody.  It's called civilian arrest and everyone has it, even Johnny Foreigner, but no, the private investigators will not be receiving constabulary rights of arrest.  They will not be receiving warrant cards.  They will not be receiving police powers.  Happy now?  Of course you're not.  Deep breaths.

Third, I've seen people in this thread referring to the Tories and 99%ers.  99% is a silly American movement convoluted to the max and it certainly isn't true of the Conservative Party or the coalition.  It doesn't have to be your view but the largest share of the voting public feel best represented by them.  For my money they're pretty bad but then again they are also leagues ahead of both the shambles that is Labour and the Liberal Democrats undergoing an identity crisis and which hoard what are deal-breaker policies for the majority of the country.  99% talk though is grounds for naughty step sanctions...and yes, the government was elected.  They just didn't receive a clear majority which is why they formed a coalition.

Fourth, if you don't want people with PTSD policing the street you're in luck, no company or police force is going to not have interviews or pyschology reports, even if it's just to appease the insurance company.   If you don't want ex-military types patrolling the streets you're out of luck because the Police already recruit ex-military types.  Where do you think they go after serving 4 years in the army having joined up at 18?  Straight into the job that will pay them nearly 50% more than their previous salary *as an introductory rate whilst training*.

If the police want to do the equivalent of renting a building so they don't have to deal with overhaul every 20 years, fine, it's not a big thing either way.  If there's going to be a glorified neighborhood watch walking around troubled estates - not a problem.  It's going to be a damn site safer and more effective than a camera attached to a loudspeaker.  If I'm behaving myself and they ask to have a word with me, I'll say no unless they're asking for help.  I'm not stupid, I know my rights.  I'm not going to lose my job, they might.  Will that person have a warrant card or police powers? No.  They're a community security card.  I'll walk past them with all the flair and authority I walk past the security guards Tescos put on the door at the weekend.  Personally I'd have preferred a Guardia Civil approach but I don't really care who comes round to my house to take my statement.  Suit or uniform; police or contractor.  The few people with police powers, the actual police, will be spending their time in a more novel approach by actually policing.

Now there, there.  Everything is going to be okay...well, it's probably not but it's not the beginning of the end either.  It's just what it is and what it has always been.  It's just everyday stuff.  There is no need for alarm.  Honestly, it's like you're seeing a cat for the first time in your lives.  If you can't be more like John Bull then at least try to be a little more like Fonzie.

true,elmntguy12,present,Lampard,"Liverpool's been on the slide for a few years.  We're still a top team, but had an extremely eventful season.  Now it's more of a Big-Four-Plus-Two-Honourable-Mentions (let's call it Big Six for ease) if anything, and yes I realize that's over a 1/4 of the table.  It's justified though because whenever any of the top six teams (Man U, Man City, Arsenal, Newcastle, Tottenham, Chelsea) play a game, you expect them to win it in relative comfort.  You also expect any game between these 6 to be an intense and tight affair, though granted this has been a fucking weird season.

I personally think that Tottenham's the weakest of the Big Six.  When Redknapp was being rumored for the England job they slid into dismal form, and we have to remember that their ""resurgent 4-1 win"" was against Bolton.

Newcastle is a dark horse and underdog and are doing a damn good job of messing with the perceived ""order"" of the table.  That being said, if Ba or Cisse get hurt they could be in for a rough time.

Man U, City, Arsenal and Chelsea are the core of the Big Six and I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon.  Any season now these are the teams you expect to see up top, and while Man U especially is the favorite to win it wouldn't be considered surprising to see any of the others grab it.

**Description:** Developing and maintaining bespoke GUI applications to control and communicate with spectrometers.  Communications will be through proprietary software drivers (C++ and Java), which you may occasionally need to extend and support.  Applications will involve multithreaded timing, graphing of displays, data logging, signal analysis (filters, transforms, and pattern recognition).  Customer base will span a variety of industrial, medical, scientific, academic, and other markets.

**Location:** Oxford, UK

**Requirements:** See linked posting, but essentially C and/or C++, Java and/or C#, Linux, and Windows .NET (Visual Studio).  GUI client development is a plus, as is any experience with electro-optics.  Exposure to scientific programming (LabVIEW, MATLAB, Octave, R, etc) is a plus.

If the movie/music industry stopped spending millions of dollars on chasing down and preventing piracy and spent it on getting a reasonable alternative set up where you could buy films and music for cheap without horrible DRM, in reasonable quality I'm willing to bet piracy numbers would drop substantially, services like spotify, lovefilm's streaming service or netflix are already making steps in the right direction.

Dempsey has a lot of experience under his belt, including a few world cups. As an attacking midfielder who likes playing up top, Dempsey could very easily be playing around with Suarez in and near the box. The two of them could be pretty deadly (and with a second striker that could be pretty insane). 

Stevie is not getting any younger and unfortunately his age is showing. He has a few good years left in him but him being injury prone does Liverpool no favors, we need another attacking midfielder. With Lucas back as DM Dempsey can have free reign to go up front and do whatever he needs to do, it will be a good fit for him.

Or in the middle you could have Downing on the left, Dempsey and Lucas in the middle (Dempsey going up and Lucas falling back) and have Stevie on the right sending balls in and working up the field when he needs to (which minimizes Gerrard's movement, which is for the better).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; If a company couldn't earn a profit by researching it, why would they bother?

Do you work in finance because you seem obsessed with the financialisation of everything? IP is the mechanism which elevates ownership over production. Look to how IP enables monopolies in every sector, look to News International, Disney, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Mosanto, or any other big company that uses protectionism to amass huge sums of money which can then be used aggressively to buy up potential disruptive tech or competition. So in the end the 'creator' has very little say in the matter because he's either an employee to a company and waives ownership or he is crushed by wealth. IP encourages a two-tiered society, the rentier class extracting wealth through passive incomes,  and those that can't.

Personally, I'd back up first, then encrypt your laptop; for no other reason than if it's lost or stolen whilst traveling, your information is at least secure, even though the device is lost. Just ensure you shut down, not hibernate the device.

http://www.truecrypt.org/ is pretty much fine as a tool to secure your data, though I'd recommend testing it beforehand as you may notice a slight impact on battery life and performance if encrypting.

&gt;The tories will not privatise the NHS **[1]**or any police services **[2]**. They won't make loads of job cuts **[3]** or raise taxes **[4]**. They certainly won't cut education, benefits or make it more difficult for job-seekers **[5]**. They will not raise tuition fees **[6]**. There's no link between David Cameron and Rupert Murdoch, who is a perfect gentlemen and heads very ethically minded newspapers **[7]**.


[1]  In 5, 10, 15 and 50 years time the UK will still have government funded universal healthcare available to everyone.  It simply will because it is profitable for the nation to be so and an immediate election winner/loser if there's anything any different proposed.  If you read the white paper there is nothing to say that the NHS is being privatised, the informed concern is that it could lead to it in the future - but then they capped the number of private patients they can care for and raised the ceiling on how much they can charge them.  Insurance will actually get more expensive, NHS hospitals with a duty to provide NHS care, will have more money.  

[2]  In the same time-frame no private contractor will hold a warrant card.

[3]  They ran on a platform of cutting the jobs of bureaucrats.  They ran on a platform of firing people.

[4]  Everybody knew they would raise taxes.  They ran on a platform of austerity and reform and tackling the debt.  People knew it had to happen.

[5]  If you thought they were going to tackle austerity without touching welfare you were insane.  They specifically announced what would be ring fenced.  Welfare wasn't in it.

[6]  Everybody knew they would raise tuition fees.  On day one of the government David Davis one of the most prominent Conservatives refused to take a cabinet position on this very basis.  Everybody knew what Davis had done and why - nobody was surprised that tuition fees were being increased.

[7]  David Cameron put Vince Cable in charge of the select committee overseeing the BSkyB bid and he would have known full well his feelings on Murdoch.  Cameron effectively left Murdoch out to hang without getting any blood on his hands. Every Prime Minister in the last 30 years has had a link to or with Rupert Murdoch.  You meet the man that owns half the press.  This one just happens to ride at the same stables as the husband of one of the editors.  So what?  It was Cameron that announced the Leveson Inquiry and it's costing Murdoch millions and millions and millions...and that makes me happy :)

* Want to save lives through fast and accurate blood analysis?  Filter peanut allergens to keep kids from going into anaphylactic shock?  Maybe help study macular pigment degeneration?  Yep, we're all over that.
* On the sciency-side, maybe you'd like to support the development of new green energy solutions?  Study the sun's corona, or monitor volcanic emissions?  Check and check.
* If patriotism and policing are your thing, maybe you'd like to help keep your deployed troops and civilian populations safe and hale, on the ground and in the sky?  We're in that space too.

Correct me if I'm wrong (and I may well be) but it seemed to me that if the current coalition hadn't been formed a revote (is this the correct word) would have been needed. I think this would probably ended in a Conservative government (but that is total speculation). 

I guess my point is I think it was the right choice for the Lib Dems, but unfortunately it has come at a time when lots of tough decisions need to be made . Although I do not agree with much of the legislation that has been passed under the current government, I have some respect for the Lib Dems and Nick Clegg for not throwing the toys out the pram about everything they dont like and accepting they will have to make a lot of compromises.

If I don't vote Labour, Tory or Lib Dem, is there another party you could recommend me looking into? Others that come to mind presently are the Greens, or Respect, butbut I don't know enough about their overall policy's at the moment to vote for them.

Doctor Who had a ""revitalization"" back in 2005. Since then it's become increasingly more popular and grander in its storytelling. Moffat's just the newest out of a long line of spearheaders, the latest mad to make an interpretation. He's reinvisioned it clearly, but the show was very much active and alive before he took it.

Similarly Sherlock Holmes was already revitalized on the silver screen by Guy Ritchie before Moffat had his hands on it, and had woven himself a series of big budget films that have met mostly positive reviews and world-wide fame. The franchise was already red hot by the time Moffat decided to strike it.

Overall these concepts are hardly ""revitalized"" by Moffat, he's merely the latest author to step in on them during periods then they were *already* popular.

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"A lot of these issues are wide-reaching and intertwined, so I'll generalise:

1. **Cost of housing** (and cost of living in general, I guess) in this country is the biggest issue for me at the moment. Stop propping up the banks, relax planning laws, scrap council tax and lower income tax in favour of a land value tax. I'm fed up of living out of a bedroom in a relative's house, I feel like my life is on hold. If we'd had politicians with spines we'd have had the correction we desperately need, which leads onto my next point...

2. **Political reform.** We've got one party with two factions (the Lib Dems sold out and are on course for self destruction) and a voting system geared to preventing smaller parties from gaining traction. Scrap the monarchy once the queen dies (she's done a decent job but the idea of a monarchy is fundamentally unfair), bring in an elected head of state and move to a form of proportional representation.

3. **Civil liberties.** I really, really hoped that when the Tories and Lib Dems got in we would see more protections for civil liberties. I am bitterly disappointed.

Those are the big ones for me, but I agree with many of the other suggestions here such as:
*Fiscal reform.* As mentioned in point 1, an LVT would help. Also need to stop speculating on housing and restore the value of pensions.
*Transport policy.* Ridiculously inefficient to split running the train service, supplying the trains, and maintaining the track between different companies, and per region. This is why we have some of the most expensive public transport in Europe!

That said...the show really does get much better. Gradually they unclench their buttocks a bit and let the show become more like the real *Doctor Who* with more imaginative settings and challenging concepts.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Alright, feedback.

I'd like to preface this by saying that it's clear that you put a lot of work into this. A completed painting is nothing to scoff at, no matter what stage the artist is at. I know how many hours go into completing works like these, so I commend you both with your wherewithal to set out and accomplish such a task *and* set it out for others to critique. That's not just industrious, that's brave and for that I give you a firm pat on the back.

Now to the actual painting:

You've chosen a very awkward pose to put the Doctor in. The gaping mouth is *very* distracting from the face as a whole and although the eyebrows are clearly trying to express emotion, the over all composition of the face implies this odd and artificial blankness. You are very aware that this is an attempt at capturing an expression and not an expression of itself.

Your use of primarily light, almost pastel colors for a lot of this painting confuses me. In some parts of the painting you seem to mellow shadows and shading very gradually (such as with the cheeks and neck) whereas in other locations you use deeper contrast in lights and darks from striking with the eyes to garish with the white line on the right of the nose.

On the topic of the nose, it does not line up naturally with the eyeline and the face. It should be turned on its Z-Axis rightward (while facing it) to be in proper alignment with the rest of the face (it's pointing straight at the viewer when it should be following the direction of the face).

The chin also has issues, the region just below his ear is shaded similarly to the forefront of his chin, when it should be more gradient (as this portion of the chin is further from the viewer and tapering into the face proper. 

The naso-labial creases are far too pronounced to be natural, making it appear as if Tennant's face as unnaturally seized up.

Be more bold with the lips. The coloring here should be definitive, not scattered. Your stokes here make it appear as if his mouth is fake. In fact, I strongly consider revision to this entire portion of the face.

The ear also needs to have bolder and more detailed strokes. The broad and undefined style you have hear makes the ear appear fake and flat.

The hair seems relatively proper, though I suggest making better use of shadow and contrast within.

The clothes should also be given more detail. Ignoring them actually makes them *more* noticeable to the eye if not simply for it's total lack of synergy with the rest of the piece.

Overall I recommend a few things: use smaller, more detailed brushes for areas like the eyes, ears, and lips. Do not be afraid of bolder and more vibrant colors than you're using, and keep the face in porportion to itself.

Overall it's clear you have talent, but have yet to refine skill. With time this will come to you, and you seem to be working on the right track. Openness to constructive criticism is the key to improvement, and opening yourself to such is very mature.

Hope my little (well rather long, actually) critique was of use to you. I happen to recognize the bow from his attempts to deal with ""four things and a lizard"" at the end of Blink!",0,1336097234,null,0,false,0,c4jvcpi,t3_t64d7,t1_c4jvcpi,t3_t64d7,null,1428852943,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,tismealso,english,auslander in deutschland at the mo,"In the case of schools, parents can opt for a paid education which is superior in many ways to a state provided education, why should the state provide cutting edge kit for music lessons when a piano does the job? my concern is more private companies running the state schools. 

The same argument applies in each example but sticking with schools, if the government provides £x000 per pupil per year, a private company will only subtract from the portion of that being used to educate the student, often outsourcing peripheral services such as cleaning and catering, those suppliers also need a profit. 

If it is a fixed price contract (no increase in public spending) the supplier must make enough efficiency savings to provide both their own profit and that of their suppliers. It would be nice if this were achieved through economies of scale (mass purchase of books) or similar but who is better placed to do that, the department of education or some fund running 5 schools? Instead the savings come by moving out expensive experienced teachers for younger less experienced teachers. The quality of teaching drops. The american education system is famously failing their youth. 

Ever also consider the conflict of interest which may face someone working for G4S collecting evidence in a corporate target driven environment when G4S also runs the prisons and directly benefits from custodial sentences? 

The IVY league in america does have some stunning universities but consider all the second tier ones, students paying for their education don't want B grades and the tenure system means that non-tenure staff are forced into giving better grades than perhaps they would otherwise. I don't speak from experience here but i have heard this argument a lot of times from a British lecturer that worked in the states.

Moffat did not ""revitalize"" either Doctor Who *or* Sherlock Holmes. He just happens to be the latest author stepping in on the franchises during periods *after* they have already been brought to promenence and have become popular again.

There *were* people who revitalized Doctor Who and Sherlock Holmes, but those would be Russel T Davies and Guy Ritchie, respectively.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"We need depth, yes, but we need to solve our pressing problems first. 

We need a winger. Downing is our only winger, and that has contributed a lot to his poor performance this season. His best time at Villa came from having Ashley Young to switch flanks with. Currently, our opponents only have to defend from the side where Downing is, since Suarez (who usually drifts out to the flanks) cuts inwards. A winger should be our TOP priority. 

Then we need a back-up striker. We currently have 2 strikers. If any of them gets injured or suspended, we're basically blunted. I wouldn't even say we need a back-up striker, we need an actual good first-team striker. Carroll's improving, yes, but his size means that we are restricted more or less to 1 style of play when he is up. Having another striker allows us to change our tactics based on our opponents and how the game is going. 

After a winger and a striker, we also need a defensive midfielder. To be exact, we need a deep laying playmaker who is also a defensive midfielder. The injury to Lucas hit our season right between the eyes. Spearing is not bad, but he is lacking in physicality and his passing range is pretty limited. Adam did play well alongside Lucas, but he is immobile, inconsistent, and his set pieces have been terrible. Both wee Jay and Chucky are good squad players to have, but not-so-good as first team choices. A deep laying, creative playmaker will free up our wingers and our attacking midfielder. Let's put it this way, for Gerrard to do his best, you need to find another Xabi Alonso. 

So getting an attacking midfielder is our 4th priority. It's pretty far back. With Aquilani coming back, we have Gerrard, Henderson and him for the attacking midfield role. Dempsey coming in will give us 4 attacking midfielders. Sure, having lots of depth is great, but only when gaping holes in your squad are filled up. 

At 29, Dempsey will give us a good 2 years of his prime. The bad thing is that he might not have too much resale value after that. The good thing is that we might recoup most of our money from the shirt sales in America. If we **DO** get him, it will absolutely have to be before our US summer tour, for the biggest impact.

Anyway. 

There are a lot of considerations when talking about buying young, and I think the owners are starting to realise this. There are 3 types of ""young"" in football, because age is usually relative to your position. 

The most basic version of buying young, is to buy a youngster in terms of age. This is usually between the ages of 17 to 21. At this level, you want to buy someone for their potential, giving them time to develop into a top player. Obviously, the risk here is that the potential is unrealised, because there are many things that can affect development at such a young age. 

The next kind is where youth is relative, and you're buying not for potential, but for medium-term impact. The age for this is around 23-26. This gives you the bulk of the players prime playing years, but it also means that the player you are getting is usually restricted in development. What you see is more or less what you get. This was the case when Manchester United bought Valencia and Young, and when we got Adam. This is the bracket that N'Zonzi falls in, and sadly I find him lacking compared to Lucas. Lucas is far from the best defensive midfielder in the world, and if N'Zonzi is far from his standard, he would be far from what we are looking for. 

The 3rd bracket is the magic bracket, which is someone between the age of 21 to 24, already playing at a very high level, with good potential to improve even further. This is the case for Mesut Ozil, and our very own Jordan Henderson (not saying Jordan is on the same level as Ozil). At this level, you need to make sure that the player is versatile enough, since their ""real"" position isn't exactly fixed. This should be the bracket that we are aiming for. 

N'Zonzi isn't a bad player. He is, in fact, pretty good at what he does. However, what he can do is a little limited. If he comes to Liverpool, he will almost definitely be a back-up to Lucas. Adam has been pretty much hit and miss this season, so we need someone to play **alongside** Lucas, not be his backup. Transfers between Premiership clubs tend to be a little inflated in price compared to transfers overseas. Granted, if Blackburn gets relegated, there's a good chance we can get him for cheap. However, he will be choosing between being a back-up for Liverpool, or being a first-team player somewhere else. 

**TL;DR:** N'Zonzi will at best be a back-up to Lucas. I feel we need a first-team defensive midfielder, one who can play the deep-lying playmaker role. N'Zonzi is not such a player. ",0,1336107685,null,0,false,0,c4jxhwa,t3_szte9,t1_c4jxhwa,t1_c4jx17a,null,1428853952,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

About 10 offline, around 100 online. 

&gt; Have you been to the US?

When I finally got the opportunity to go they decided to put gropers in the airports. I didn't want to get groped both ways.

&gt; Have you interacted with many yanks in a 'normal' setting, not around bases as described here?

All of my interaction with them has been normal. 

While I know that people will not like this, I dislike them for their culture. For their attitude. One might say ""The US is huge, people are so varied!"" but they have similarities across the board, negative traits that I dislike and general things I cannot get along with. First of all, anyone who is a republican I cannot get along with. Second of all I cannot get along with Christians who take their faith seriously. Thirdly I cannot deal with flag wavers of any nation.

That is not all, but that quickly eliminates around 60-90% of the US population from my social circles.

Note that I also feel the same about most countries, including our own. I have very few British friends by choice for different reasons. The British middle class are a bunch of passive aggressive cunts. The working class are dull and sullen. The lower class are scum. Generalisations? Sure. 100%.

An extract:
&gt;He [Ian Hansen, Member of FI Legislative Assembly] added, ""It is deeply sad to see Mr Zylberberg clambering over a war memorial, especially in this anniversary year.  Sadly, this illustrates the disrespect the Argentine authorities have for our home and our people.  Unsurprisingly, at no stage does the video feature any Falkland Islanders – a clear reflection of Argentina's policy, which is to pretend that the people of the Falkland Islands do not exist.  It is time the world took note – we do exist, and as with all people we have rights, which the Argentine Government is trying to deny us.  We are our own people, who through nine generations have lived and worked in these islands for nearly 200 years.
&gt;
&gt;""We determine our own future, and we will not be bullied by the Argentine Government, neither by their attempts to undermine our economy, nor by their constant misrepresentation of the truth, nor by pieces of cheap and disrespectful propaganda such as this.  It is hugely disappointing to see sport abused in this way, when it is so often seen as a vehicle for unity.

Unfortunately the reality doesn't bear that up. If you have more than 2 candidates who have significant support, it's fairly unlikely that any one will have a majority in FPTP, and the way it creates incentives to vote tactically means that it's very easy to end up with situations where there would be a majority support for another candidate over the elected one (I mean that's always possible, but under FPTP it's *likely*).

It means that a significant proportion (majority?) of our politicians went to an upper-class public school, then on to study PPE at oxbridge and then straight into politics without having any other jobs or career or life experience. Their lifestyle is very far removed from that of most of the population and as such they struggle to understand and empathise with the issues and opinions that matter to a lot of us.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Knee jerk reaction that won't solve anything, no matter what ""spin"" campaigners put on it. There's a far, far easier solution:

* When people sign-up for internet accounts, have the customer service operator ask them if they'd like the account to have access to adult content.
* Most, if not all, ISPs bundle in Firewall / Parental filters as part of the package. Include a simple user guide [either a print copy with the technology, or have it easily and readily accessible on the ISPs website.] that details how to set it up, and how to block access to certain services [Facebook, pornographic content, Messaging software, etc, etc.]

Those two steps alone, should solve the issue. *However*, there are two other steps that would remove the need for steps like the above.

* **Actually parent your kid[s].** You bought the smartphone / tablet / computer for 'em, and you paid for the internet connection to be installed - why should ISPs be forced to add implement additional measures - which will be introduced at the detriment of other subscribers [Increased subscription fees anyone?] just because you can't raise your kid properly. If you don't want your kid to potentially access porn on the internet - either put the computer in the living room, supervise their access, or install and learn how to use the software that likely came with your service.

* **Actually talk to your kids about sex.** Sex education shouldn't be the burden of the State - in the same way that you shouldn't rely on schooling alone to educate your kids about a whole plethora of subjects, you shouldn't expect their sex education to come from schools either. Talk to your kids - you're the best judge of what they should know, at what age. Stop living up to the stereotype of the sexually repressed Brit and actually educate your kid[s].

1. Get corporations out of government and leave the fucking internet alone. Keep politicians and businesses away from it. Any censorship is bad, and the pirate bay block is a HUGE issue that I don't think is getting enough attention. A LOT of special interest groups will be delighted at TPB ruling. If record labels can get TPB blocked, maybe more groups of people can get more websites that they disagree with blocked. Very dangerous precedent.

2. Improve the economy. Consider that the average wage in this country is only £23,000 a year, and you only take home £18,000. Most people are actually fairly poor and having a decent standard of living is a struggle. Especially if you look at the cost of houses, cars, food, electronics etc. I can't really see how anybody can afford a mortgage, raise kids, pay bills and save money on £18,000 a year. Oh wait, nobody does save money! That's an impending disaster. And it's especially annoying at how much cheaper the same item can be in another country.

3. Stop spending so much damn money. We really can't afford it right now. 

4. Modernise everything. Our roads are shit. Our internet is shit. It amazes me that as such a powerful country how damn backwards things are compared to other countries. The NHS is a prime example in many regards. I worked in a hospital for a year and the amount of paperwork is staggering.. why the hell isn't it computerised?? Why do patients have real life paper files, rather than electronic records? Receptionists still keep written down appointment books, and they get lost. Hell, we are still widely using FAX in hospitals. Absolutely terrible.

5. Education. And not just reading and writing. How about common sense lessons? I can't be the only one who thinks that understanding my electricity bill is confusing. Why can't we have lessons which apply to real life. What is APR%? How do I apply for a mortgage? What do various terms mean? How does a credit card work? (amazing the amount of people who don't know this). And what about everything else - how to save money, invest money, trading stocks and shares, unit trusts, premium savings bonds etc. These are essential things, and I bet that not understanding a lot of things means that a lot of people get a horrible deal on everything.

People talk out of their ass when it comes to this and hide behind their degrees pretending that because they know a lot about the work they are doing they automatically know how safe and good GMO products are.

There is a reason Monsanto does not allow anyone to research their ""products"" and also buy companies that do research that gets to close to exposing just how dangerous GMO's are.

You are not smarter then me, just more educated in your specialized area, which does not give you any more ""right"" or authority to make a comment then anyone else.  I was merely pointing out and will continue to point out that people like you are talking out of your asses, because unless you actually work for a GMO company you do not know how safe or good GMO's are.  Even if you did work for one of these companies you would not share any of that information for obvious reasons.  

So again i rest my case.  You do not know, cannot and will not know enough to make a case for GMO, it is impossible.  And that is the point, until there are independent studies on the effects of GMO on health, environment, both short and long term combined with a study on how it will affect non GMO seeds and plants, it should not even be allowed out of the test tube.

I am not a scientist, I am a human being that depends on the food produced on this earth, the only one we have for now, and i don't want GMO's to contaminate my food.

I don't see how asking for contributions from those who use our roads for the upkeep of those roads is considered ""crazy"". You may not agree with it, but this is a rational policy.

It seems to me that as long as we're building a new stadium we might as well take the opportunity to make it larger than that.  What would be the downside of a 75,000 seater for example?  Wouldn't the costs associated with building one that much larger be offset by the increased annual revenue?

The stated reason for wanting to build a new stadium is that our current capacity of ~42,000 leaves us in an uncompetitive position wrt the other big European clubs.  Sure, 60,000 is an increase of 50% over what we have now, but it is still 10,000 less than the Allianz arena, 15,000 less than old trafford, 20,000 less than the san siro, 25,000 less than the bernabeu, and 40,000 less than the nou camp.  So if the reason is financial competitiveness, why don't we plan for something that would be even more competitive wrt the stadiums I mentioned?  Surely those rivals would continue to bring a lot more matchday money than us if we go with 60,000 (and I've even heard 55,000 being mentioned).  We'd be very competitive in England, but how about on the European stage?

What would be a downside of building a 75,000 seater?  Surely we could fill it every week?  Is that what they're worried about?  What else could it be?

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"&gt;Everyone trots out the teachers and nurses line but there are a great deal more people in the public sector than just teachers and nurses.

Yeah but these are the things people care about most. The NHS budget makes up a massive chunk of public spending.

&gt;And there's also a stack of utterly shite teachers too, but because they're in the public sector, they're practically impossible to get rid of.

Bullshit. Even if they were ""easy to get rid of"" we couldn't. We don't have enough teachers in the first place because they're paid a shit wage. Those who can, do.. etc

&gt;It's funny how you claim that people from public schools are out of touch. Funny how these ""out of touch"" people recognise the value of same-sex marriage. 

Bollocks. The latest proposed changes are empty political gesturing. It's just changing the name from ""civil partnership"" to ""civil marriage"". It's wasteful political point scoring, and you can bet your arse there are plenty of people employed in ""non-jobs"" to come up with initiatives like that.

&gt;Or attacking the the stupid race discrimination that goes on in our council adoption agencies. Or raising the retirement age (set when many people didn't live to see it). Or scrapping the useless home sale packs. Or scrapping the useless Audit Commission. Or how about raising the income tax allowance?

All of that, even though I agree with a lot of it, *is* completely out of touch. It's not what people care about at all.

&gt;I couldn't give a shit where people are from or how they were educated, all I care about is having the best-educated most intelligent people in the right position.

Yeah, and as you correctly point out, it's no coincidence that that always ends up being the upper classes who've been to public school. They're not the most intelligent, or the most suitable, they're the richest.

Also, I'm not sure being the best educated or most intelligent makes you the best person to be in government anyway.

Erm most people care about how much money is in their pocket, not how much money is in the pockets of others.  They care about the price of supermarket food, petrol, their mortgage, and if they can have a holiday this year.  Teachers, nurses, police - all far less important.

That's the difference between realism and idealism, right there.  Of course the young student rebels here won't agree but since many of them have little to no experience of life I wouldn't expect anything else.

&gt; Bullshit. Even if they were ""easy to get rid of"" we couldn't. We don't have enough teachers in the first place because they're paid a shit wage. Those who can, do.. etc

I'd rather have large class sizes than shit teachers who lack basic English skills.

But at the very least, when the ballots are in and totted up and there's an observable upwards trend (if not outright explosion) of support for the party then that's something for the press to speculate on. People become aware of this support and suddenly they're not a joke any more. People have such a tunnel vision about this, it's all about winning and losing but that really oughtn't be the case. Our political options really should be evolving through a process like this but that will never happen when people are unwilling to vote.

I also think that if people *truly* believe ""they're all as bad as each other"" they should just spoil their ballots en mass. When you see voter turnout as low as 25% in some places the press can dismiss it as apathy, an unwillingness to get involved or just that people are uneducated fools that literally don't know anything about politics. In fairness, all of these things may be true.

Even France have been on the Islands longer than Argentina! The UK were present on the Islands before Argentina was even a country.  Argentina think they have somehow have ""inherited"" Spain's claim to the Falkland Islands.

The people of the Falklands overwhelmingly wish to remain British.

&gt; In an Argentine-inspired poll in 1994, 87% of the island's population rejected any form of discussion of sovereignty under any circumstances, preferring to remain British.

http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/south-america/falkland-islands/?profile=history&amp;pg=3

But Argentina think the Islands are theirs, and reject the idea the residents of the Islands should have the right to self-determination. The stance of the British government is that the Islands' sovereignty will never even be open to discussion until the people of the Falklands want it to be, which currently they do not.

Meanwhile, Argentina uses a mixture of propaganda and childhood indoctrination to foster nationalist sentiment. France supports the UK claim, and the UN and Commonwealth of Nations recognise the Islands as British territory. Countries like Mexico, Peru, Brazil, China and Iran support the Argentinian claim.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"The Falklands have never had an indigenous population. Discovered by the French in 1504, the islands have served as a temporary port for many nations including Britain, Spain (who owned Argentina before they became their own country), Portugal, the U.S. etc. 

There have even been some small outposts on the islands but never a permanent base. A Colonel David Jewett serving in the precursor to the Argentine navy (The River States of Rio de la Plata as it was known then) ""officially"" claimed the islands for them in 1820, however this is disputed because his letter never seemed to reach the government, and no official confirmation ever came from the government at the time. Furthermore, historians suspect his claim was more to secure any riches contained within the wreck of a French ship run aground on the islands whilst he and his ship were stopped there for supplies.

In 1828 rights were granted by the United Provices of the River Plate to one Luis Vernet to setup an outpost and exploit the islands natural resources, primarily feral cattle. In 1831 Vernet attempted to assert a monopoly on seal hunting in the area and captured a U.S. ship in an effort to do so. The U.S. considered this an act of piracy and dispatched a warship to liberate their property. 

In 1833 the British sailed into Vernet's port and lay claim to the islands. Citing numerical and tactical disadvantage, Vernet relented and the islands have been in British hands ever since. Whatever claim they had was invalidated by Vernet and subsequently left with him as well.

So it's a bit of a mess really. Vernet was authorised by the precursor government of Argentina, but some argue he lost those rights when he entered into piracy against other sovereign nations. If his actions had been accepted, that would mean a government official had performed an act of war against the U.S. and the British have had continuous control over the islands for over a century now.

The Argentine argument that the islands are so close to their coast is moot in my opinion, as the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea state that a nation's territorial waters extend for 12 nautical miles (22km) from a nation's coast. The Falklands are 460km off the Argentine coast so geographical location is irrelevant.

Raising the income tax level is something I can agree with, but it's a tiny step, and the truth is it will make hardly any real difference to most people, because any gains made thanks to lower tax liability are offset by rising cost of living thanks to inflation.

Spoken as someone who's worked damn hard for a living for over a decade (and I file SA, so I get to see exactly how much difference the tax changes make), minor tax breaks are great, but not the biggest issue. Especially when rent, petrol, food are becoming less and less affordable by the day.

Actually I'd disagree. The current system criminalises people who haven't committed violent crimes and appears to be very focused on detention but not rehabilitation. Consequently those that end up in prison are effectively handed to career criminals for recruitment. Our current prisons have full access to illegal drugs and all manner of things. Our current prisons are overflowing. Locking more people up isn't the answer. We should be locking up less people and focusing on rehabilitation.

&gt; comment about defence spending

I actually know quite a bit about this one. UKIP's policy is based on pre-Strategic Defence Review plans. The MoD has told the current (and to  be fair, previous) government that it cannot sustain offensives on more than one front. The role of the armed forces in light of the SDR has been redefined in terms of less ground warfare and more effort on logistics and nation state building. We have no need for a giant navy, because the plan is to rely on NATO for support in 90% of circumstances. What we need is an approach based on 21st century thinking, which is where we're going. Eurofighter will probably be the last generation of Air to Air manned planes, possibly one more after that but there won't be many built for the home market. The future is with robots and unmanned vehicles, and a smaller armed forces, not with turn of the century scale manual labour.",0,1336145482,null,0,false,0,c4k22ci,t3_t6k0x,t1_c4k22ci,t1_c4k0is6,null,1428856114,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Which is a statistical paradox that can be applied to voting theory which in context basically says: if you divide the population into groups (like districts etc) then the proportion of the population voting for a party might not meet the proportion of seats for that party. 

This is just a problem with ANY non-PR voting system. But if we want to keep our districts and boundaries then PR is an unlikely system to be implemented. But these boundaries only allow for gerrymandering: where the party in power can re-draw these boundaries to advantage their number of seats:proportion of votes ratio, so should be scrapped anyway!

In a *proportional* voting system your vote would *not be wasted*. But the truth is that almost half of all voters in *every constituency* are *not represented* under first-past-the-post and alternative-vote systems. This is a shocking indictment of the political system.

A major party wants you to believe the vile propaganda that ""there is no such things as a wasted vote"". Why?

&gt;Piracy is not raiding and plundering Best Buys and FYEs, smashing the windows and running out with the loot. It’s like being placed in a store full of every DVD in existence. There are no employees, no security guards, and when you take a copy of movie, another one materializes in its place, so you’re not actually taking anything. If you were in such a store, you’d only have your base moral convictions to keep you from cloning every movie in sight. And anyone who knows how to get to this store isn’t going to let their conscience stop them, especially when there is no tangible “loss” to even feel bad about.

&gt;It’s not a physical product that’s being taken. There’s nothing going missing, which is generally the hallmark of any good theft. The movie and music industries’ claim that each download is a lost sale is absurd. I might take every movie in that fictional store if I was able to, but would I have spent $3 million to legally buy every single DVD? No, I’d probably have picked my two favorite movies and gone home. So yes, there are losses, but they are miniscule compared to what the companies actually claim they’re losing.

I can't count the amount of times I've been out in Lincoln and heard locals complain about the military. The main complaints are from girls who have had one-night stands with lads who have then just never bothered to contact them again, so I understand the girls there being upset about it. The blokes in the area get pissed off because there's a lot of lads around and that increases the competition for ladies' affections on nights out. 

We drink, yes we do, we go out and sometimes get smashed, I have been a twat in the past, just like everyone else, the thing about being military though is that it is a way of badging someone and people remember when it's a military person. 

Training units are worse, when you have the younger guys going through some rather intensive training, they go out and blow off steam, that can and does sometimes cause friction with the local populace. One example I remember from a few years ago (around 2000 I think) was when I was doing a course down at Exeter University. Military personnel were banned from a few pubs in Exeter due to an incident where some Royal Marine commando trainees had beat the shit out of a local lad and had put him in a wheelchair, absolutely disgusting behaviour. That sort of thing IS rare, however it is something that sticks in the minds of local people for years, so it is hard to change opinions after something like that. When I went out in Exeter I left my military ID at home and took my NUS card.

So, him being a big indie British artist and all, do you think the BPI have helped the guy out in any way? The correct answer is no. And do you think the Pirate Bay helped the guy out in any way?

One could say the same of the politics of this subreddit.

&gt; Making out that anyone who disagrees with you is a ""young student rebel"" with no experience of life? Are you serious? You can't accept that anyone could have a valid point that happens to disagree with your own?

I never said anything of the sort, thanks.

&gt; Just a plain and simple ""Fuck You"" right here.

Aww, baby needs his dummy?

&gt; Raising the income tax level is something I can agree with, but it's a tiny step, and the truth is it will make hardly any real difference to most people, because any gains made thanks to lower tax liability are offset by rising cost of living thanks to inflation.

Yeah, inflation caused by the economic policies of the previous government.  Won't stop you blaming the ""bloody tories"" though, will it?

&gt; Spoken as someone who's worked damn hard for a living for over a decade

Oooo, a decade eh?  Wow.  Try being self-employed your entire working life like I have.

&gt; NOT only that, but the income tax bracket makes ZERO FUCKING DIFFERENCE when you're one of the millions of unemployed.

Zero fucking difference except to the people who now have more money to spend, and who therefore inject more money into the economy (hint, public sector is not the economy), and who therefore help create more jobs in the private sector, helping pay for the public sector you love so dearly.  Or are you one of these people who think that by increasing taxes you make everyone richer?  lol.

I have not had the chance to see any Classic Who, but that does not impede on your ability  to enjoy the revival, or what people call 'NuWho'. I've only been able to enjoy the most current Doctors (9-11). Give it time and I'm sure you'll find the Doctor among these three Doctors that you consider 'your Doctor' :) because I have not seen Classic Who, I'll only refer to the most current 3 (Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith).

Personally, I think all 3 of these guys were fantastic. You'll find that they all bring something unique and amazing to their reincarnation of the Doctor. I consider 10 as 'my Doctor'. However, when I started, I was sure that no other Doctor could replace Eccleston properly. He's my first Doctor and I have a special place in my heart for him. But Tennant and Smith proved me wrong and showed that it is possible for all 3 to do great.   I'll admit that I didn't care for Smith (11) when I finished the show for the first time as I was adamant that he could never live up to Tennant. I'm almost finished with my second rewatch and I now LOVE Smith as much as Tennant.

Wow, forgive me for rambling.
**TL;DR** All 3 Doctors are amazing and unique. And when you get to a new one, and you think you're sure you won't like him, give them a chance :) Also, the show is a bit cheesy the first few seasons (I don't know how many times I gave up on the first episode 'Rose' because of how campy it felt) but stick with it.

Sometimes that's good. The classic series suffered from 26 consecutive years of broadcast, so much so that people stopped caring about it. That's why I liked the idea of 2009 being limited to just specials, or Series 6 being split in half. *Doctor Who* is very good, but history has shown us that too much *Doctor Who* can, in fact, be bad. 

As for a Jenny special, even if it's stripped down, that's still a lot of time and effort for a one-off thing that may not work. Besides, Georgia Moffet is a young mother now. I'm sure she loves the Jenny role and the larger franchise, but that's asking an awful lot from a woman with a baby, to risk a time-consuming venture that could either be a rip-roaring success, or fizzle out into nothingness. It's not as though her husband can stay at home with the baby, he's an actor as well. 

Jenny was popular, but there are literally hundreds of stories and episodes with one-off popular characters. I mean, I'd campaign day and night for Carey Mulligan to be a companion (or even a recurring character), but that'll never happen. Similarly...

Especially ones that are struggling against bad publicity, lawsuits, etc...  I didn't say that anyone is patenting every single living organize.  I said they are saving the DNA and the seeds of every living organism.  But that does not stop people from trying to patent everything.  Monsanto has applied for patents on pig breading in 160 countries, just because they decoded the genome.  Whats interesting about this is, many pigs are becoming sterile due to GMO feed and in the USA they are culling pigs that do not conform to some illusive standard that only they seem to know.  But monsanto has the answer to this problem already...

Also one only has to remember

“Who owns life?” the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that “Monsanto’s patent on a gene is valid and wherever that gene arrives in any higher life form they own or control that higher life form.

The science behind GMO is a problem.  You cannot change a healthy cell you have to attack a cell to change it's structure, this is often done with what works best, viruses.  Of course you can bombard cells or radiate them, but E-coli bacteria is also used in the process.  While scientist can be clever they can also do very stupid things.  How about testing a nuclear bomb in space?  ah yes, at the time many scientists thought it would completely destroy our atmosphere and kill us all, yet that is exactly what they did.  Now you are telling me that we should just trust these scientists with our food source....

And back to your opening question on Variola13.  If i had the details of where she worked i bet i could find the connection between that company and Monsanto.  

For supposed clever people, you really need to look into the GMO issues more closely instead of spouting off about the good it does without actually siting the good it does.  ",0,1336157488,null,0,false,0,c4k4rrq,t3_t4wta,t1_c4k4rrq,t1_c4k2k9s,null,1428857448,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,AndorianBlues,k9,K-9,"A few more tips (getting people to check out classic Who is a Great Thing):

- You don't necessarily have to watch classic Who in order. Pick some random Doctors, find out what era you like, build from there.

- There are loads of streaming websites, but just FYI: The DVDs of Classic Who are one of the most lovingly restored and complete releases I've ever seen. Every (multi-episode) story is digitally restored, has text and audio commentary, extra contemporary material like Radio Times listings or commercials, making of documentaries, the occasional deleted scene or blooper.

- One thing that will probably be confusing at first are the numerous companions, especially in the black and white era, where most companions are basically interchangeable in character. You'll get the hang of who came before who eventually, though.

- Even the most ardent fans will admit that a lot of the stories from the 1980s are just a bit crappy. However, most of the times there's still something to enjoy. The only one I can say nothing good about is ""Timelash"".

- Don't ever attempt to watch a 6, 10 or 12 parter in one go.

Writers sometimes spend years upon years writing books, which libraries and school lend to thousands of people each. This is a direct parallel to piracy, except one is widely accepted and the other is heavily panned by the media.

I think piracy is wrong because you *should* compensate the original creators, but at the same time, as dabby has brought up it's not always that simple. Germans struggle to buy certain games because of draconian measures, software developers add ridiculous DRM that is worse than viruses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal some companies make it damned near possible to view content in other principalities, then turn around and complain when people torrent ad-free files. The problem is on both sides, but to ignore the part content owners play in piracy would be foolish.

In addition to this, the supposed losses that everyone talks about simply do not exist. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/piracy-once-again-fails-to-get-in-way-of-record-box-office.ars is proof of this, as the MPAA (you'll see their name on every Hollywood movie) have made record profits year after year in spite of the piracy scandal - even ignoring the global recession.

*To intentionally or recklessly apply unlawful force to another*


""Intentionally"" means the decision to bring about a given consequence, ""recklessly"" refers to deliberate risk taking.


""Apply force"" can mean as little as touching the clothes of the individual in question.  The force does not have to be, for instance, punching someone, it can be indirect, for instance using a wire to trip someone up, the force is applied when they hit the ground.


""Unlawful"" is debatable, there are situations where the application of force is lawful, for instance a parent controlling a child, or a police officer arresting someone.  However, throwing an egg at a politician (no matter how much they may or may not deserve it) is not a lawful application.


In the context of this scenario, the person throwing the egg clearly intended to hit him, there was an application of force when the egg hit, the force was strong enough to break the egg open.  It was also an unlawful application of said force.



Therefore, the person that threw the egg is guilty of assault.",0,1336168451,null,0,false,0,c4k752z,t3_t710u,t1_c4k752z,t1_c4k6kqu,null,1428858567,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

This serves no purpose other than to turn Bale's head and I sincerely hope it doesn't work.

He can also fit into multiple positions / formations, Fulham have played him as a lone striker at times, more often behind a striker (Stevie type role when we had Fernando) and he can operate as a midfielder (not something we exactly need, but its an option, he'd work well in a 5 across midfield type set-up - Gerard doesn't have the legs to get forward like he used to). 

I feel we lack a midfielder who attacks through the middle, Adam is too slow, Gerard is getting on, Hendo and Downing do it, but theyre on the flanks.  He'd do the job.  Looking at the loss to Fulham, there were so many times i was totally frustrated with the lack of players in the box or up in support we had when Carroll won headers.

She gives me the '*really...?*' look anytime she sees me watching DW. And I hate watching DW (or any of my favorite shows) when she's in the room because she talks during it on purpose to be obnoxious and complains about how stupid it is. And she gets pissed when I talk during her silly reality crap shows...

Example: I started my 2nd DW rewatch recently. Today, I was just watching Let's Kill Hitler on Netflix. She complained about it so I turned it off so she could watch what she wanted... *shudders*... Those godawful Tyler Perry/Madea movies.

**TL;DR** As someone with a mom who prefers shitty mindless crap when it comes to TV, I am jealous ;)
