true,godsdebris,tennant,Tennant,"I guess I never really thought of #10 with Rose and Martha as a Doctor who was chasing after girls like a contest. I viewed him as a lonely man who wanted to travel with someone and, yeah, it ended up being women. It's the same with Amy--she happened to be a woman but once he found out she was getting married he went into relationship counselor mode. I didn't want him to get romantically involved with Amy but I got seriously annoyed when we spent a lot of time focusing on fixing Amy and Rory's relationship while going on Timey-Wimey adventures. It felt like the Amy and Rory With The Sidekick Time-Lord Doctor Pal Show! Now I know that the previous seasons focused a lot on Rose and her feelings and the stupid situations Martha and Donna got themselves into, but the doctor was there and I liked see him deal with those sorts of interactions. I liked Doctor/Rose. I was happy that his clone that sprouted from his severed hand allowed Rose to have that. I mean, if the Doctor can fall in love with a Time-Lord who cannot regenerate and has a fixed death eventually in the future, then it seems to me it's all right for him to fall in love with a human who has the same fate before her someday. What I liked was that even though he had those feelings for Rose, he pretended as though he didn't and Rose completely understood--and I never found it selfish that in the end she tell him that she loves him outright and hope to hear the same words in response from him. I liked that the Doctor never got to finish expressing his own feelings, eluding to the fact that the Doctor is someone who, regardless of how he feels, is really all alone. I feel it's why when he presented Rose with his Clone!Doctor and Rose asked him to tell her what he was going to say way back when and never could finish that he chose not to say it after. In his place the words were said by his clone. I dunno. I know that Russel Davis has some weird ideas as to how to end things, I just felt that he did a great job with the Doctor and his personality. I'm digressing some.

* We've already paid the transfer fee, we're paying his wages, we may as well show this lad as much support as possible.
* And since we're not going to get that fee back, why not just play him?
* After all, he still young enough to adapt/evolve into the system that Rodgers likes.

And another thing I was thinking about. What will maximize the success of Andy Carroll?

* Quality service.

The way I figure, Carroll is obviously not the sort of goal-scorer, passer, or creator like, say, Suarez, right? Unless passes are just being bombed towards his head all the time, Carroll may not be at his best as a lone striker.

So, if he has the time to get into the flow of the match, if he gets good service, and isn't the focal point of the offense (i.e. with Suarez and possibly someone like Borini upfront with him), I feel as if a lot of space will be opened up for Carroll and he could 'succeed' (however we want to measure success for him. 10 goals? 15? 20?).",0,1342111306,null,0,false,0,c5d0u8f,t3_wfnkc,t1_c5d0u8f,t3_wfnkc,null,1429359157,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I do eat meat so i'd be a hypocrite if i were to be in favour of complete abolition of the meat industry. The problem is, we're omnivores. We've always eaten meat. For every veggie out there, there's 10 meat eaters. The meat industry is currently the only sustainable way to deal with the demand. I can't imagine the carnage if we were to try abolition. In a perfect world, we'd perfect the science of vat-grown meat, indistinguishable from the real thing. Then we could really start the ball rolling.


The gallup mirror test is only one of a plethora of ways to test varying levels of cognitive function. Self awareness is a scale. Humans are not aware of the fourth dimension (literally - through senses) or the infra-red. That doesn't mean our current spectrum of awareness has no value. The ability to rationalise the way humans do may be limited solely to humans, but that doesn't diminish the importance and depth of what other species' can feel, think and do.


Animals are made of the same stuff we are, just in a slightly different configuration. I don't understand why so many people immediately assume that there can't possibly be any other configurations which feel the same depth of emotion humans do. We aren't perfect either. There must also be configurations which surpass our current spectrum of cognitive ability. 


Anyone who has ever worked with animals or has pets will testify that they share deep emotional connections with them. Unfortunately we are limited by the fact we cannot directly communicate with them, and because we are of a different species, are unable to 100% understand social bonds and body language. Technology will ultimately be the key to unlocking this. When understanding day happens, we'll realise how barbaric we've actually been to a plethora of highly sentient species who  simply lacked the vocal abilities to tell us to fuck off.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is not strictly an answer to this but more and more I'm starting to think we don't have a RW problem, because I'm not sure we are going to have a right winger. Genuine wingers seem to be dying out and the cutting edge system of choice revolves around three dynamic, involved attacking midfielders with some dribbling ability (lined up in whats vaguely a 4-2-3-1). This is essentially the system employed by Spain and Germany, and at times by Barca, Madrid, and City.

With out new purchases we have the personnel to pull this system off. Back four is fine and would probably have Lampard and Mikel in front of them (RDMs top choices for that role it seems). Then in front of that (and behind Torres) you basically choose three players from the pool of Mata, Hazard, Ramires, Marin, De Bruyne, McEachren, Piazon, etc.

They would each have a base position (RAM, CAM, LAM) but would be given a lot of flexibility to move around, including the license to drift inside and wide as is needed. Iniesta demonstrated this perfectly for Spain this tournament, adjusting his position to allow Jordi Alba to break either outside or inside him depending on where the space was.

This system relies on good movement and excellent short passing rather than the more direct and aggressive style we inherited from Mourinho (its worth noting he abandoned that after leaving Inter for Madrid), and I think that is what Roman wants.

Sure, a legally owned gun could get stolen, but so could anything else. A gun isn't inherently more dangerous than anything else. Cars get stolen and driven into people all the time but it's not illegal to have your car stolen. 

Also, we do have plenty of legally guns in this country and as far as I know there isn't a massive problem with them being stolen and used in crimes. Banning something because it might get stolen just doesn't make sense.

&gt;Similarly, you can't 100% prove to me that you won't use them for a crime at some point in the future.
Again, I would use the car analogy. I can't 100% promise anybody that I won't plow a huge 4x4 through a pedestrian area or drunkenly crash it into a bus stop of people, and yet we have no problems issuing driving licenses to millions of people. And unsurprisingly, very few incidents like this happen because most people are responsible, law-abiding and decent people who don't want to hurt others.

&gt;It's a lot easier to kill people if you've got a tool that was specifically designed to do it.
That is true, but are you saying that would-be mass murderers are put off by logistical difficulties? It just doesn't make sense. Somebody hell-bent on killing a class full of school kids ISN'T a normal person. They aren't going to give up their crazy convictions, lack of morality and insanity because it's slightly more difficult to do the job. 

Even THEN, guns aren't really that hard to make. With basic metalwork you can make something which will fire bullets. And ammo is fairly easy to get. And again, the UK doesn't seem to have a massive problem with this.

The fact is that the vast majority of people are decent, law abiding citizens, and restricting gun ownership because a tiny minority of crazy people *might* get their hands on one and do something bad just doesn't make sense! What I'm saying is that after Dunblane, guns in the UK have been given continual bad PR and most people never think to question the law as it stands. They just think that guns are only for crazy people, gun nuts or americans. And they automatically think that more guns in society would massively increase crime. When in reality, guns have never really been a huge problem in the UK and I don't think they would be a huge problem if they were legal today.

&gt; *What about the Middle Way Group's research into the wounding rates of shooting?*

&gt;The Middle Way Group has recently published a research paper on the wounding rates of the various methods of shooting foxes. This has been seized upon by those who argue that hunting with dogs is a more humane method of killing foxes than shooting because it either results in a quick death or the fox escapes. The research puts shooting and hunting in perspective by stating that at least 80,000 foxes are killed each year by shooting (compared to the 20-25,000 killed by hunts according to Lord Burns, of which a third were killed by shooting). Its findings on the comparative effectiveness of different shooting scenarios are based on the results of single shots and are not particularly surprising – it finds that **lower wounding rates are achieved by more skilled marksmen using rifles and penetrative ammunition, and that inexperienced shooters with less accurate weapons run a greater risk of wounding the fox rather than killing it outright**. It also reinforces Lord Burns’ conclusion that lamping is the most effective method of shooting. The report cites apparently high wounding rates for shooting but it states that in practice they would probably be halved because of the use of follow up shots and dogs to track down wounded foxes.

Yes they did, no they didn't and yes you have. However as you were taught and tested for your GCSE on a modular level, if you covered it in year 9 and was tested for that module that year, chances are you didn't use it again so forgot it. Compare that to O levels where you'd be taught it around the same time, keep practising it the following 3 years and be tested on it in your O level exam in Year 11 or whatever it is when you leave school.

They can be scary to look at in the light but it's when the lights go out, you turn your back or even blink that they will attack you. There is also The Silence, you only know they're there when you look at them and if you look away then you totally forget about them.  

Midnight is special because like you said ""it takes words, the Doctor's weapon, his oldest standby, and turns them against him."" and that makes it much scarier. The 900 year old time lord who has fought with gods and demons. You'd think you'd be safe but this time you're not!

true,[deleted],null,null,"In a way, advertising for Visa or MasterCard helps both. While their respective advertisements might promote the use of a Visa debit card or a MasterCard credit card, in fact what they serve to promote is the use of cards for payments, regardless of their brand. Someone comfortable with using a MasterCard credit card is likely to be equally at home using a Visa debit card, and vice versa. Banks, who tend to be shareholders in both, are happy with this state of affairs too - they want as many transactions to be electronic as possible, and anything that helps that they're happy with.

FWIW, Visa and MasterCard are both architecturally different. Visa's system is a fair bit less resilient than MasterCard's:

&gt; MasterCard's network is significantly different from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.

They also both charge different fees to banks and to merchant acquirers for issuing their cards and accepting their cards respectively.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Oh yeah sorry I didn't mean to suggest we don't want new players, I just mean to say that I'm not sure RW is the position we are searching for.

Muniain would work perfectly but I don't think he will leave Athletic for a little while. I actually think Oscar could be an impact player at this position right away. I watched him play against Argentina and have seen some other video and he seems like the real deal.

Marin is not really an untested player so much. I'm not sure he's a star, but he's proven himself in a competitive European league. I wouldn't list him as a starter right now, but I wouldn't be at all concerned about having him as a backup.

But yeah I think the starters currently would be the ones you listed. I also think that there is nothing wrong with giving serious playing time to a 20 year old. We as a club like to wait a really long time before offering significant minutes to our young players. Fabregas was captain of Arsenal at 21, not that I'm suggesting that's something to aim for, but think about how far removed that is from our mentality.

I'm pretty indifferent to getting Hulk actually. I like him, but he is very pricey. My dream player to pick up is Mario Gotze, but he's not leaving at least for a few years. If I was in charge I'd make moves to buy Alan Dzagoev because I think he's a great player for reasonable money. Then I'd roll with the guys we have, and develop them as players, seeing who emerges.

The club fears youth, which is why we ended up with such an old team, I say we change that. We just won the Champions League, now is the moment to take a season to develop the team. I think with the lineup I am describing we will still compete for trophies, but the real idea is to build towards a team that can dominate down the road.

true,LogicalWhiteKnight,null,null,"&gt;But it isn't lawful to carry anything around with the intent of using it as a weapon.

True currently in the UK (though it hasn't been that way for very long), but if you happen to have something on you which you were carrying for another reason, like say a baseball bat while walking to the diamond for a game, and you are attacked and all the criteria for the use of lethal force are met, you can use that baseball bat as a weapon legally.  At least that is my understanding of UK law.

This pretty much sums up my understanding of when it is acceptable under the law in the UK to use a lawfully owned gun for self defense (likely in the home) http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111027050058AApAYak

So, you can use one if you reasonably believe it is necessary to stop an imminent threat, but legally it will be tricky.  See this case for an example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Martin_%28farmer%29

Interestingly enough, the justification for the use of lethal force is the same in England as it is in the US, we also use english common law to determine the justification for the use of lethal force, and since here it is legal to carry things around with the intent of using them as weapons in self defense (even guns), that is a legitimate legal way to use them.  

My point is that from a US perspective a murder is a misuse of a gun, not what it was intended for, while a justified self defense killing (or preferably just using it in self defense without killing anyone) is an intended, lawful use.",0,1342117883,null,0,false,0,c5d2s10,t3_wfnc2,t1_c5d2s10,t1_c5d2iit,null,1429360070,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I agree, but think now is the time to splash the cash if we are ever going to as FFP looms. I don't think Hulk is the end-all answer for Chelsea, but think he would be an excellent fit.

&gt;My dream player to pick up is Mario Gotze, but he's not leaving at least for a few years.

:(

&gt;If I was in charge I'd make moves to buy Alan Dzagoev because I think he's a great player for reasonable money.

I rate Dzagoev, but would rather see us buy more of a passer in the vein of Spain's 3 AMFs. I think he could work well, though, and would be happy if we got him.

&gt;The club fears youth, which is why we ended up with such an old team, I say we change that. We just won the Champions League, now is the moment to take a season to develop the team.

I agree and think that we will develop the team, but at the same time add some already established players (like Hazard). This is why I think getting someone like Oscar is so vital--funny as at first I didn't really rate him--he is incredibly talented and can be part of Chelsea's new spine for the future.

true,will_holmes,eng-norfolk,Naaarfak,"As a registered Conservative, I reckon I could help you out with this.

Firstly, it should be noted that UKIP is a splinter party from the Conservative Party, and the two parties have somewhat of a love-hate relationship. Nigel Farage used to be a member of the Conservatives until the Maastricht treaty in '92, and many UKIP supporters vote Conservative when there is no UKIP candidate. Conversely, many Conservative supporters vote UKIP in the European Parliament elections. 

They are very similar parties, and at least form the Tory side, there is an air of admiration for Farage et al.

The hate part of the relationship comes from when both parties field candidates and split the vote, which has caused the occasional Labour or an ironic LibDem victory, but I digress.

In essence, the Conservatives make a big deal of democratic principles, and they oppose any political system other than one which allows the British people to decide their own laws. Democracy has worked for Britain for a long time, so the Conservatives have been increasingly uncomfortable with the unwillingness of the EU to adhere to it.

TL;DR: Tories share roots with UKIP. Tories &lt;3 Democracy, sees EU as not very democratic, Tories increasingly uncomfortable with EU.",0,1342120625,null,0,false,0,c5d3ktv,t3_wg9hg,t1_c5d3ktv,t1_c5d2nvw,null,1429360447,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

As for liking the character, I love how it was written. The romanticism and adventurism. With a different actress she would make the series for me. But Kingston, I can't like. I find her from annoying to repellent. Originally they tried to get Kate Winslet for River Song. That would have worked. Actually I think that would have been great. But Kingston, no.

As the template for the show isn't really suited to ""badassery"", the most we really get is 9's Dalek-rage, River as a sort of Indiana Jones brains/badass hybrid character, or a few episodes with Captain Jack as a soldier/playboy.

What would be interesting to see is a total badass travelling with the Doctor. It wouldn't work long term, but why not for a 2 or 3 part episode?

true,unlundun,null,null,"* What subject area are you in?

I'm doing a PhD in Ancient History. My subject is the impact that the withdrawal of Imperial Roman power and its replacement by the church as the dominant power structure had on discourses and practises of family life.

* What university (if you don't mind telling)?
A Russell Group uni in the Midlands :)

*  How many hours a week do you work?
Am in my writing up year, and work at another Midlands uni so currently I only work 1-2 days a week. Maybe 10-20 hours. When I was full time, I would do anything from 40-60 (guessing at upper limit) hours a week. 

* Do you feel you are better off in academia than in industry?
Um, yes. Industry isn't interested in people like me, and academia is. There is no industry, that I could find before doing my PhD, that would use my skills in a way that interested or motivated me. Although my subject of Ancient History is under attack and is being reduced hugely in many universities around the UK, making a lecturing position extremely stressful. I have moved sideways into skills and writing tutoring/lecturing in HE with some subject based teaching which is the best of all worlds for me. 

* What do you wish you had known before taking on a PhD?
That it's normal to be depressed, stressed and to loathe your thesis on regular occassion. That finishing a thesis is so hard. I wrote an M.Phil thesis and so I thought I was prepared, but I was not. And in a purely subject specific sense - German! Learning that alone has been hard. :)

* Please go through what your decisions were upon leaving university 
and why you chose to take a PhD.
I got my UG degree, did better than I was expecting, left academia for a year to have a think, had an awful, depressing time in industry, went back to complete an m.phil, loved research and writing with all my heart so I stuck around!

I'm not going to go  tell you to fuck yourself back like gilthanan did or anything (which is unlike me because I typically love a good ""fuck you too""), but you read into my comment's face value a bit too much.

You're right, I don't know you, I don't know what life experiences you've had. ""You clearly have not experienced depression due to what you have to say about it"" was obviously *also* not meant to be taken literally and instead as a figure of speech, as we both agree on the undeniable: we don't know each other very well at all. What I meant was, ""*I can't fathom* how you could have experienced depression with the mindset regarding it that you convey.""

Maybe I should have said that instead, and my original post ended up being more inflammatory than I intended, because I didn't. For that I apologize.

I stand by my point, though. Telling someone who has depression to ""man up"" and ""get the fuck over it"" is absolute bullshit. I experienced some fairly severe depression in my late-teens/early-twenties, and I've also had an (at times, lately not so much) pretty socially-debilitating speech impediment for my whole life.

I tell you this not for pity, as my life is great at the moment, but I'd simply like to make a point. Maybe you'll take it to heart, maybe you wont, but if there's one thing I know its that there is no other sentence in the English language that is as completely useless and cruel to a person with my condition as ""*just spit it out already.*"" Telling someone with depression to ""man up and get over it"" is no less fucked up or futile. You may as well tell an amputee to man up and regrow a limb.

Anyway, I'm sorry I insulted you, but shit like that really gets my goat.

Diamonds ARE common gem stones with an artificially inflated price.  Sorry, but that's the truth of it.  But hey, if you want to base your marriage on a commercial of shadows made by a company who's sole product is diamonds (look up DeBeers), knock yourself out.  

Sad that you seem to think a simple proposal is what defines a relationship.  Funny, I always thought wanting to live the rest of your life with someone was usually based on personality, rather than consumer products and tradition.

Me, I like to exercise my critical thinking skills rather than letting mega-corporations, monopolies, and cartels telling me what love is.  

But hey, live your life as you see fit.

true,ashmaht,tardis,TARDIS,"I started with the 9th Doctor, watched just about everything (and I do mean everything, including 10's animated adventures) up to this past Christmas special, and I found myself in very much the same place you find yourself now.

So I started watching the classic series... Let me just preface this by saying that I've been downvoted heavily in this subreddit for voicing my opinions on Classic Who so it's entirely possible that I'm totally alone in my thoughts on it...

Classic Who isn't like the 2005 relaunch. It just isn't. The pacing is different. Very different. And the storytelling, in general, is very much a product of it's time. That's not an insult, by the way. That's just me trying to warn you about how different the Classic series feels for someone who's used to NuWho.

The first Doctor can be kind of a pain in the ass at first. He just seems sort of rude, he's constantly getting tired, and his granddaughter never stops screaming his name. I'm told he learns to be less of an asshole over time, but I couldn't force myself to wait for that to happen. That said, every Doctor Who fan should check out the original pilot.

The second Doctor is kind of fun. He's weird and he randomly plays a recorder. And he's actually pretty funny from time to time. The third Doctor was probably my least favorite (but I'm definitely in the minority there so you might want to ignore that). He just seems bland compared to the second. But he has a car. A yellow car. And that takes balls.

The fourth Doctor is just as awesome as everyone hypes him up to be. He's weird, he's funny, and he has a huge scarf. If you only see one fourth Doc story (and why limit yourself?), check out Genesis of the Daleks. It's great.

The fifth Doctor is definitely the ""most human"" other than Tennant. He's not very interesting though, at least from what I saw. And he has some of the whiniest companions. But he wears a vegetable on his shirt.

The sixth Doctor often gets a bad rap. I actually really like him. He's crazy, kind of violent, and he dresses like an actual clown. Plus his companion is Peri. And Peri is... well, there's a lot of bouncing.

The seventh Doctor has a hat. And he plays everyone like they're chess pieces. He's a brilliant strategist and it's definitely cool to see his plots unfold. But his companion, Ace, is pretty much the worst parts of the 80's rolled into one person.

Eight only appears in the movie. Well, he's in the audio dramas, and I really hope he comes back for the 50th anniversary, but his only appearance on screen so far was in the movie. And the movie... It's not great. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it could definitely have been a hell of a lot better. Still, you can catch up on a whole incarnation of the Doctor in 90 minutes. Can't really pass that up.

Honestly, I'll probably get even more downvotes for this post than I got the last time. If you want to watch the Classic series, go for it. Have fun with it.

true,lapsedgenius,null,null,"Regardless of solvency, and in the absence of radical reform to the monetary system, Dave's ""bank"" will never ever be able to compete with the lower interest rates offered by institutions in posession of a banking licence. As neilwilson and congregational correctly point out above, these august institutions have been bestowed with the literal licence to create money out of thin air when they approve a ""loan"" which they then have the staggering audacity to charge interest on.

This is definitely not a conspiracy theory, the Bank of England freely acknowledge the role of the private banks in creating 97% of the money in the UK. Semantic arguments as to whether this digitally created currency can truly be called money are entirely specious as the zeroes and ones are exchangeable for bricks and mortar and are therefore, to all intents and purposes, money.

Meanwhile the magically created money (yes - there actually is a Magic Money Tree flourishing despite the recession in the fertile valleys tended by the nation's private banks) has to be paid back in ""real"" money in the form of a mortgage commitment over several decades by mug punters like the 95% of UK adults working in frequently menial and stressful occupations.

But are they really mugs if everyone else is doing it, and if we all cling to the quasi-religious conviction that nothing is ever going to change? Because a return to the old days, if they ever truly existed, where banks were only allowed to lend the money they actually had would cause an unprecedented crash in the housing market overnight. 

And who would vote for that?

The Army experience especially really taught me what actual exertion can be (6-7 days of 21-22 hours awake per day doing stuff really pushes you) - that said I don't think any less of someone for not having done that. Sure, it might be a good indicator that they understand the value of hard work and money more, but that's not necessarily the case. I've known people who've never worked anything less than a white collar day in their life who understand the value of hard work. The BBC is just propagating this idea that using your mind to work isn't *really* work, that it's somehow lesser, less hard, or less valuable to the world.

true,LogicalWhiteKnight,null,null,"&gt;IIRC there is a mod you can do to remove the lock aspect, making them legal. 

Legal and more dangerous to use as a tool.  I'd rather not risk slicing my fingers thanks.  Personally, since I live in the US, I carry a locking 3"" folding knife, I find that to be a very useful tool, and I do not carry it as a weapon and wouldn't use it as a weapon even if the need arises (I carry a concealed handgun as a weapon which I would go to before my knife for self defense)

My point is merely that while cars are not designed to kill humans, they are quite effective for it, and that logic could be used to ban them the same way that locking knives are banned even if they are not designed to kill humans, because they are quite effective for it.

Also, to expand on that, guns are quite effective at killing humans, and many (like handguns) are even designed to kill humans.  But they are not designed for unlawful killing of humans, their primary purpose is not murder, that is a misuse, just like using the car for murder is a misuse, and not their primary purpose.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"I disagree on your reasoning that it's our laws that led to low gun ownership. It goes way back imho.

Britain became (mostly) politically stable during the time of the sword. We haven't fought using firearms in the British Isles very often (Irish Independence War excepting). We eliminated all of the dangerous animal predators centuries ago. Aside from personal defence and hobby shooting there isn't a reason to own a gun. 

Conversely, America was built on the culture of homesteading, with settlers heading ever-east. This was during the time of the rifle and it was natural that they would be used for self-defence in the lawless unsettled lands.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; I'm arguing that more guns doesn't necessarily mean more crime, that's all.

IMHO they do. Guns make crime really easy. Take stabbing someone to death; you have to get up real close and personal to do it. You feel the knife penetrate their body and you soon feel blood on your hands. You get to see the life bleed out of them literally within arms reach.  And that's if you successfully kill them with a single strike which is pretty unlikely unless you hit a key organ/artery. 

Now consider guns. Easy as taking a photo, point &amp; shoot. It can be done from across the street and you probably won't even see any blood unless you stick around. The higher kinetic energy makes serious injury highly likely from a single wound. 

That's just the case for murder. You could make similar arguments for other weapons-based crimes, e.g. bank robberies or street muggings. Having a gun makes them all so much easier. ",0,1342130996,null,0,false,0,c5d6f5m,t3_wfnc2,t1_c5d6f5m,t1_c5d137f,null,1429361786,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You could however take the same line of argument with knives. They vary wildly from small innocent cooking knifes through utility and hunting. Almost all could be used as a weapon in the wrong hands. UK law currently prohibits any knife who's primary function is a weapon, hence the ban on lock knifes and switch blades. It's far from perfect legislation but the logic behind it is at least consistent with the intent. 

&gt; The primary purpose of a handgun is self defense or sport shooting, not murder.

See my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/wfnc2/firearms_laws_question_for_my_fellow_brits/c5d6b11) about the fundamental cultural difference between the US and UK wrt firearms. People in the UK simply do not associate guns with self-defence, it's not a part of our homeland mindset. 

Sport shooting derives from the other uses of it, a good analogy would be race cars. Both are about honing your skill at the primary use of the device, with competitions to allow the best to compete. The issue with handguns specifically is that their primary use *is* killing people, be it in self-defence or offence.

I claim the same is true with knives like the leatherman, their day-to-day usefulness very much outweighs any ""leatherman as weapons"" argument.  A lock on the blade doesn't make it a weapon, locking blades are useful for knives intended to be used as tools as well.

&gt;Target shooting won't help you get your groceries home!

No, concealed carry is not for target shooting, the intended use is only lawful self defense, and that can indeed help you get the groceries home.  Just check out this incident where a concealed carrier saved the day without firing a shot, possibly saving multiple lives including that of the criminal (who would likely have been shot by responding police officers): http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/conceal-and-carry-stabbing-salt-lake-city-smiths/NDNrL1gxeE2rsRhrWCM9dQ.cspx

Target shooting for sport is a good argument for why they should be legal to own, but the only argument for concealed carry is self defense.

&gt;Sport shooting derives from the other uses of it, a good analogy would be race cars. Both are about honing your skill at the primary use of the device, with competitions to allow the best to compete.

Oh yes, I love that example.  The analogy goes even further, and I can use it for my argument.  A race car is designed to break laws, it is designed to go faster than the speed limit and accelerate at a pace considered reckless which would get you a ticket.  However, it is not sold to you with the intent for you to break laws, that is not a race car's intended use, that is a misuse, even though it is precisely what the race car was designed to do.

In the same way, it is still legal to use lethal force in self defense in the UK.  Handguns are illegal to own or possess, but I can imagine a situation where a criminal attacks you (or perhaps more than one attacks you) and loses control of his illegal handgun, and you get control of it and use it lawfully in self defense against that criminal (assuming he continues to pose an imminent threat to your life) or another armed criminal.

You may not see handguns as a tool for self defense, but that is still a legal and legitimate use for them, assuming you are not guilty of a crime for the acquisition and possession of the gun itself.  In the same way, some people see race cars only as a tool to break the law, while that isn't the case.  I can drive my Ferrari around on normal roads within the speed limit and not break the law, and that is how it is intended to be used, that is it's purpose as sold by Ferrari.  It is designed to be *able* to break the law, but it is not intended that you actually use it to break the law, and handguns are the same.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I disagree on most points. You raised a lot of points but none were backed up with facts or figures, only guesses. And the thing is, I don't blame you for making those guesses because they SEEM so common sense. Ask most people and they will say ""of course a gun is more dangerous than a knife"". But let's be honest - in the UK guns have been illegal and restricted for a long time, they have had very bad PR for a long time, and most UK citizens have never seen a real gun, let alone fired one. Generally we are afraid of guns and don't understand them, and all we know is that they are bad and belong to criminals.

Ever fired a handgun? I had a few times when abroad and it's actually not *that* easy to hit something. I'd shot bb guns, air rifles etc, and I thought it would be fairly easy, but my accuracy was actually pretty rubbish at 10 or 15ft. Point and click is a big understatement unless you've had training.

In fact, this pdf http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Aveni/OIS.pdf from the US Police Policy Studies Council has statistics that almost all shootings occurred within 15ft, and 82% of the shootings were within 6ft. That's very easy stabbing distance and far less than ""across the street"". I think that someone without training and who didn't take time to establish good aim wouldn't actually be able to hit a person across the street. Whereas under 6ft with a knife is almost a guaranteed hit.

The same pdf shows even trained policeman having an accuracy of 15-20%. That means for 5 bullets fired, only one hits the target. And they are policemen who have been trained and assessed to hit a target at 25ft to qualify for carrying the gun. I think that claiming shooting somebody is ""easy"" is quite a myth, obviously perpetuated by movies.

In terms of lethality, *if* you do get hit by a bullet, it appears that the mortality rate is similar. Not a large sample size, but here's some data from a hospital is Australia showing gunshot with a fatality rate of 24% and stabbing 17%. Not a huge difference. http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2007/pdf/trauma_injury_2005_57-68.pdf

As for criminal psychology, perhaps you're right that stabbing somebody is a more ""intimate"" act. But I would guess that if you are the sort of person who wants to kill someone, you wouldn't be put off by the sight of blood. I'm not sure and I don't have any data about it, but I would guess that there isn't much difference. As for intimidation like muggings, at a distance close enough to mug someone a knife is a more effective weapon anyway, and it's just as lethal and intimidating imo. Bank robberies.. maybe a gun makes it easier to subdue a crowd of people, but how common are bank robberies really? With modern technology I doubt they're even worth it any more.

Another common argument is that guns are dangerous and that people can get hurt by accidental shootings. In fact, more people in the USA die by falling into swimming pools than accidental gun deaths (from the book Freakonomics by Levitt and Dubner). A fence around a pool saves more lives than a gun safe.

All I'm saying is that you/we should look at the data and make decisions. Guns aren't inherently bad, dangerous or only for crazy people.

&gt;I don’t understand

&gt;July 12th, 2012 · 20 Comments

&gt;If manufacturing has low profits and pays shit wages, services produce high profits and good wages, why does everyone say we need more manufacturing?

The simple costs of producing here and benefits of not producing here are what isnt conducive to manufacturing. There is no way to lower the cost without becoming a third world nation, taxation isnt the issue, hell many manufacturing companies are not british and do not report profits in the UK anyway. It is cost of living and hiring workers. 

Worstall's point is glib but pretty true, we have a good high tech manufacturing sector, we of course want more of that but looking at manufacturing high or even low tech as a solution to unemployment will not work. Stuff that needs mass employment can be done elsewhere.  Manufacturing in the UK needs now, for the most part, a very high set of skills in certain areas it as automation has made it far cheaper to get rid of large amounts of workers.

Although it may now seem difficult to distinguish, there was once a fairly clear distinction between the radical right-wing, Thatcherite Tories, and the more consensus-driven, post-Imperial Tories. I think it is Thatcher's radicalism, and the terrible split that her European policy caused in the party, that explains their modern dogmatism on the issue.

The Sontaran Strategem/Poison Sky: Okay, this is pretty weak. The Sontarans just aren't that interesting, and neither is the whizkid.

The Doctor's Daughter: I really loved this episode. But there seems to be a lot of hate for Jenny around, so I guess a lot of people didn't?

The Unicorn and the Wasp: Great. The Doctor visiting specific historical figures is usually pretty excellent, and the deliberate Agatha Christie parallels improve this particularly.

Silence in the Library/Forests of the Dead: Among the best horror episodes in all of nuWho. Also, River Song.

Midnight: Again, among the best of the whole series.

Turn Left: Good. Not great, kinda gimmicky. But good.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; I claim the same is true with knives like the leatherman

Totally agree. Saying that, while I do see myself as a ""fix-it"" guy who takes most things apart, I'm not sure how much daily use I'd get out of one. More something I'd keep in the car. 

&gt; No, concealed carry is not for target shooting, the intended use is only lawful self defense, and that can indeed help you get the groceries home.

I do see your argument and to a large degree I agree with you. Where we differ is where the balance of outcomes is between those who never once draw their CCW verses those who use their legally obtained weapon to commit crime. America seems to have gotten used to school shootings for example; the UK public just isn't willing to do that. Dunblane happened a long time ago but isn't forgotten, it was even topical recently as one of the Wimbledon finalists was a child at the school when it happened. In the US ""going postal"" is pretty much a laughing matter &amp; we all rooted for Michael Douglas in that movie!

It may not even be down to the owner or someone with access to their gun. Someone could simply club you from behind for example and steal your weapon while you are down. Regardless of the method, guns will fall into the wrong hands at a greater rate than present. 

This would be very bad for the UK. We are in fact [considerably more violent than America](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_ass_vic-crime-assault-victims), but our murder rate is far lower because violent crime rarely leads to a fatality. Every Thur/Fri/Sat night in every large town there are people drinking heavily who go out looking for a fight. Some take drugs to help with this, with vallium, tamazepam and cocaine being popular. A Clockwork Orange isn't too far from the current reality in this respect. 

I hate to think what the outcome of these people having guns might be. Sure, ""an armed society is a polite society"" but the problem is that drunken thugs aren't thinking all that rationally. 
Even if the drunks never used a firearm, the legal CCW people would not act as a preventative measure to any great extent. We'd just end up with more dead, mostly drunks but a fair share of bystanders and permit holders who were overcome. 

&gt; A race car is designed to break laws, it is designed to go faster than the speed limit and accelerate at a pace considered reckless which would get you a ticket.

True, but most race cars are not ""road legal"". They fail many noise, emissions and safety regular. Likewise, there are many guns that are pretty much universally prohibited for civilian use. Even the US would have banned full-auto entirely if it weren't for the gun-collectors. It was probably wise not to piss them off!

&gt; In the same way, it is still legal to use lethal force in self defense in the UK.

It's a bit of  a grey area to be honest. We have the weakest form of castle doctrine here, you have to be in genuine fear for your life. If you took a gun from a home invader and shot him in the struggle then you would be fine. The second you are no longer in danger then any further acts of violence are considered criminal. Easy to say on paper, not so easy to draw a line in real life. Is beating unconscious ok? How else are to supposed to end the struggle so you can phone for the police? 

The Tory party did speak out on this topic about a year ago and they said that no one would be prosecuted for legitimate self-defence in their home. However, to the best of my knowledge this hasn't been backed up in any change to the law, making the statement worthless. Additionally, this all applies only to home defence, out on the street we are on very shaky legal ground in the UK should we defend ourselves. AFAIK people have been found guilty of second-degree murder when someone who attacked them has died in the fight. There's also the legal issue of ""eggshell skull"" to consider; if they have a medical condition (even hidden) then tough luck for you. Here's hoping I won't get attacked by a drunk with a heart condition tomorrow.

And a free trade agreement would almost certainly have punitive terms attached which would do much, much more damage than that small amount. I'm certainly doubtful of the route of federalism, but if we were allies that could be counted on not to imminently disappear, we could well have steered Europe away from its course.

However, at even 2ft away there is a considerable difference in the psychology required to kill someone. Wouldn't surprise me if the physics inverse-square law holds true here to some extent. 

In terms of the cops poor hit rate in field-use, that's probably a side-effect of their role. On the range things are a bit more controlled. In real life they are reacting to a deadly threat, often at a moments notice. That they even get a shot off from hostered probably puts them well ahead of an untrained user!

&gt; here's some data from a hospital is Australia showing gunshot with a fatality rate of 24% and stabbing 17%. Not a huge difference.

Still well beyond statistically significant risk increase from 1 in 6 to 1 in 4. We banned passive smoking for far less. ;-) I could play the statistics game and point out that it's a 50% increase in the likelyhood of dying. 

&gt; at a distance close enough to mug someone a knife is a more effective weapon anyway

Agreed. I assume you are thinking here along the lines of poor accuracy in close combat and the more usefulness of a knife in trained hands. But there's another aspect that makes knifes better; the increased likelyhood of use. Particularly here in the UK where a gunshot will result in a guaranteed heavy armed police response. If you are merely stabbed they might rush their donuts before going looking (in relative terms at least!). 

&gt; maybe a gun makes it easier to subdue a crowd of people, but how common are bank robberies really?

Quite common, more-so weaker targets like arcades, betting shops and even restaurants. However for that you really want a shotgun which is possible to legally obtain in the UK. Plus I believe a large number of the ""I have a gun"" crimes involve replicas and maybe even fingers in pockets.

&gt; Poverty, abuse, lack of education, gang culture, bad parenting etc.. THEY facilitate crime.

I could not agree any more with that. However, given the UKs current social issues, more guns might not lead to more crime, but they would surely lead to more deadly crime. ",0,1342137500,null,0,false,0,c5d7yne,t3_wfnc2,t1_c5d7yne,t1_c5d725l,null,1429362600,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,LogicalWhiteKnight,null,null,"&gt;This would be very bad for the UK. We are in fact considerably more violent than America, but our murder rate is far lower because violent crime rarely leads to a fatality. Every Thur/Fri/Sat night in every large town there are people drinking heavily who go out looking for a fight. Some take drugs to help with this, with vallium, tamazepam and cocaine being popular. A Clockwork Orange isn't too far from the current reality in this respect. 

See that is what scares the shit out of me, that is why I won't ever visit the UK, because if I did I'd want to be able to conceal a gun for sure.  I don't buy that lack of guns makes the violence less likely to be lethal, as far as I can tell from the statistics your homicide rate didn't really change significantly in response to the handgun ban, you lose some gun homicides and pick up some homicides with other weapons.  Gun violence isn't as lethal as some people think, a single shot to the chest is survivable most of the time with prompt medical attention, and often gun violence takes the form of threats, and no shot even needs to be fired to achieve the desired effects, such as a mugging.  I do not see gun violence as inherently more dangerous than knife violence, in fact if I were unarmed I'd almost rather be attacked with a gun than with a knife.  I'd also much rather have a gun facing a gun wielding attacker than have a knife or be unarmed facing a knife wielding attacker.

I think the reason the homicide rate is less in the UK is because criminals have a different mindset, there are not nearly as many out to kill people as in the US.  They want to beat on each other, have some good sport, and everyone goes home (or to the hospital, but not the morgue).  That's not how we do things in the US, criminals play for keeps over here, so it is a different culture.  You can assume a criminal will leave you alive after getting what he wants in the UK, that assumption doesn't hold in the US.

&gt;Even if the drunks never used a firearm, the legal CCW people would not act as a preventative measure to any great extent. We'd just end up with more dead, mostly drunks but a fair share of bystanders and permit holders who were overcome. 

It seems many people who make this argument really care about saving the lives of the violent criminals, the ""drunk thugs"", but you make a good point that some permit holders would likely lose their lives in situations where they would not have died if they didn't have a gun.  That doesn't bother us in the US, because it is a personal decision whether or not you carry a gun, and society doesn't shoulder the responsibility if an individual dies because of it.  We believe in individual liberty and responsibility, I realize that I may be more likely to die in some situations with a concealed gun than without, and I am willing to accept that in order to always have that choice, and avoid being a helpless victim, which to me is worse than death.  There is also the possibility of a situation where I can avoid death with a gun when I would not have been able to without a gun.

&gt;True, but most race cars are not ""road legal"". They fail many noise, emissions and safety regular. Likewise, there are many guns that are pretty much universally prohibited for civilian use.

Fair enough, I guess I see a regular car as like a shotgun or rifle, a Ferrari like a handgun, and a formula 1 race car as like a grenade launcher, RPG, fully automatic weapon, or other weapon with is justifiably restricted in who can acquire it and how it can be used.  I see no reason to ban handguns, just like there is no reason to ban Ferraris, but where each of us draws the line is obviously subjective.

&gt;It's a bit of a grey area to be honest. We have the weakest form of castle doctrine here, you have to be in genuine fear for your life. If you took a gun from a home invader and shot him in the struggle then you would be fine. The second you are no longer in danger then any further acts of violence are considered criminal. Easy to say on paper, not so easy to draw a line in real life. Is beating unconscious ok? How else are to supposed to end the struggle so you can phone for the police? 

Indeed, we have the same grey area here, we inherited your common law.  We implemented much stronger castle doctrine laws in the home, so you can assume that someone is a lethal threat if they unlawfully entered your property.  But there is still a grey area if you are clearly aware that they do not pose a lethal threat, such as the situation you describe.  You get the gun away from them, and have them at gunpoint, so do they still pose a lethal threat to you?  If they are still conscious, they can lunge at you to try to grab the gun at any time, but generally how we define it in the US until they actually start that lunge, start moving towards you, they are not a lethal threat.  If they run away, you can't shoot them in the back.

There is also still a large grey area in public, where a lot of confrontations occur.  The grey area has just been shifted in the favor of the person claiming to be using lawful self defense.  Just look at the George Zimmerman case for an example of how charges can still be levied against someone with a reasonable and plausible self defense claim.

&gt;The Tory party did speak out on this topic about a year ago and they said that no one would be prosecuted for legitimate self-defence in their home

Well that depends how you define ""legitimate self-defence in their home"".  

&gt;However, to the best of my knowledge this hasn't been backed up in any change to the law, making the statement worthless.

The law doesn't really need to be changed, just interpreted differently like we have in the US.  Like I said, we still use the same common law definition of the justification for lethal force in the US, just shift the presumption of innocence to the person claiming to have used justified lethal force in self defense.

&gt;Additionally, this all applies only to home defence, out on the street we are on very shaky legal ground in the UK should we defend ourselves. AFAIK people have been found guilty of second-degree murder when someone who attacked them has died in the fight

That is horrible, no one should be prosecuted for defending themselves from an attack with force that they reasonably consider necessary to save themselves or someone innocent from great bodily injury or death.  Perhaps your laws do need to change, even if the gun laws don't, in order to ensure people are not unjustly prosecuted.

&gt;Here's hoping I won't get attacked by a drunk with a heart condition tomorrow. Living in Glasgow it's a genuine concern.... ;-)

Well, I'm rooting for you!  I guess your best bet in such a situation is to run like hell, even if it's not really safe to do so.  They say to never turn your back on a knife, but sometimes in the UK I guess it's the best choice.  Even if you beat the knife, you might not beat the charges...

Worked as a butcher's boy first - horrible job, cunt of a boss.  He was one of those power-hungry pricks who felt he wasn't getting his money's worth unless you were constantly in motion, no matter if there was actually work that needed doing or not.  A total bully too (and cheated the public).  You'd clean the (walk-in) fridges tell him it was done, he'd go check and say not good enough, so you'd go back in to them, sit down and read  magazine, go back and say ""Okay, I've redone it"", and he was all like ""Right, that's better, why couldn't you have done it like that the first time?""  His entire staff were in secret rebellion because of this: they'd do everything from acts of minor defiance and sabotage, through outright theft, to nasty stuff like peeing in his tea.  This taught me to treat co-workers, especially ""subordinates"" with dignity.

Did a paper round, quite liked the independence of it, but the pay was inevitably shite.  Did give me a touch of financial independence too though, which I liked.

Worked pressing women's underwear.  Taught me, amongst many other things, being one of very few young guys in a factory of older women is downright scary and how bad the more commonly occurring reverse must be.

Worked in a tea and coffee factory.  Taught me how, even with a nice boss, I hated factory work, waking up every morning with black snot,  and didn't want to have a lifetime of this.

Worked as a cleaner in a carehome.  Invisible, treated like crap.  Despised it.

Worked in my last factory, on a production line, totally braindead work filling bottles of shampoo and bleach and so on.  Always getting minor injuries and burns.  Went to sleep in the evening dreaming of the motions I went through for hours at an end during the working day.  Draining, pointless, unfulfilling, bullshit.

Of the three Doctors we've had in the series so far, I have to say I think the lowest of Ten (which is in no way saying I dislike him unless we're talking about the last few episodes of the Specials because be just wears on and on and I'm getting off topic), but Midnight is SO PERFECT in its execution and premise that I hate that Blink is normally the ""This is the episode to introduce someone to the series on"" episode.  (I'm also a dork who still thinks that Rose is the best introductory episode, or if you're going to start later you should start with Eleventh Hour.)

Anyway, I like how Midnight is essentially a psychological/sci-fi horror teleplay that could be acted out on a stage for the most part.  Its simplicity and the pure drama played out are what helped me get into Tennant's era (before this I sort of shunned post-Ninth Doctor episodes because Ninth was *my* Doctor).

I'll tell you now there are a few centreback partnerships in the Championship that I'd be choosing before the likes of Cherundolo, Onyewu and Bocanegra were approaching the top of my list.

And to take us back to the original point of the discussion, the real laughable contention in this thread is the idea that Dos Santos has ever destroyed defences **anywhere**. Even his Mexico form is hugely hyped, and what little good he has done on international duty has been against poor teams, or heavily weakened decent teams in meaningless friendlies.",0,1342147606,null,0,false,0,c5dabvd,t3_wfsm2,t1_c5dabvd,t1_c5d9hsf,null,1429363708,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

This is liverpool we're talking about, we may have had an offensive season, created a lot of chances, but we still lacked in finishing and quality. We need all we can get, Carroll included. We need a decent substitute who can also be a specialist. His strength to pressure players off the ball and his aerial threat (which is becoming more and more lethal) can be a perfect backup plan or a complimentary player to a more grounded player. Suarez hogged the ball too much and wandered around. He never really synched with Carroll because of his footballing behavior on the pitch. Not that I'm ragging on Suarez, that man is brilliant. But who knows, maybe with Borini or perhaps Dempsey, he'll get decent service as well is distribute.

Carroll is starting to show his true colors and it's been paying off enormously. His passion and energy has become so large he can lift the team spirits when he gets subbed in, Dirk Kuyt style.

Believe me, my feeling about it not being good to do comes from very difficult first-hand experience!  I've always had to fight against the same tendency as you.  It's worst when I'm quoting a British person to someone else and I accidentally lapse into that person's dialect.  

One thing that's good to remember is that a lot of Brits have a very romantic view of America and are as excited to be here as an Anglophile is to be visiting Britain.  They want the full American experience, including things that we take for granted that seem hopelessly exotic to them.  I've seen British people go nuts at finally, finally getting a chance to have those ""Twinkies"" they've heard of for so many years.  I once showed an English friend around town and the thing that impressed him most was seeing an actual squirrel in a city park.  The accents we think of as dull are exactly what they want to hear!

Rodgers does not often publicly state a strong desire to keep a particular player. But he has done so with Suarez and Maxi. He obviously think of Maxi as a squad player since he is quoted in the article as saying: ""Whether it was starting or coming off the bench, he would be very good for our squad,"". He does seem to rate Maxi highly, and that is one player who could teach some of our underachievers about positioning and smart runs inside the box.

He also looked a lot better when he played longer games. 10 minutes to fit in and do something isn't his style. We know he isn't fast, so his 'fresh legs' don't make that much difference.

That's actually a fantastic point. I don't actually blame Sansa myself, but *technically* she did have a hand at least in Ned's arrest. She did her best to save his life and ask for mercy, I'll give her that.

I agree with you, in the beginning of the series, Sansa is very sheltered and basically lives her life according to songs, stories, and fairy tales. I think the thing I like about her character is her development, essentially her realizing that the songs and fairy tales aren't true, but she still remains a lady. Just a cautious one.

Agreed though, Littlefinger, Cersei, and Joffrey were the ones conscious of causing Ned's fate.

3. It depends on whose perspective you're looking at it from. From River's perspective, He knows all about her when she first regenerates into River Song and she knows very little about him, and he doesn't know her at all when she dies, while she knows everything about him. But River's time line is more U shaped than line shapped, and if we're being technical, closer to one of those wobbly wobbly balls of time, specifically because of episodes where she appears at two different stages in her life- for example, The Impossible Astronaut, where she's the gun toating full of her self River that Knows almost everything, while she is also the naive River that just graduated college and now has to kill the doctor. Same issue in the subsequent episodes where she is the little girl in the space suit, while also being the woman running from the silence.

How he was so close to living the normal life he always says he can never have, and how he is genuinely happy, only to find out that the man he is inherently can't possess that life, as shown by the scene at the end when he's changed back and goes to see the love interest, and she asks him to leave. I won't say anything, but that aspect comes back in a good way later.

What I wasn't so fond of in the episode, however, is how Martha handled the entire thing. She's just so unsympathetic and heartless that it did a lot to make me not like her character.

In that, with the gold standard, there was little incentive to lend, when the limited currency meant it would be worth more as the economy grew anyway (so you didn't have to risk anything).

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; What I can see from Brussels is that, and also from a European perspective, I find it a little bit ironic that some people are suggesting for Britain a role comparable to that of say Norway or Switzerland. Norway or Switzerland are two marvellous countries, I very much admire, the most advanced countries in the world in fact with great qualities of life. But I think Britain is expecting a bigger role in the world than small countries.

This is the crux of the issue. The main reason our political parties remain generally pro-European. If Britain wants to influence the world the EU is the only mechanism we really have for it. Look at the recent ACTA mess. The US essentially bullied the independent nations into accepting it. Then the EU parliament told the US to fuck off.

The EU is the only body we are a part of or potentially a part of that can stand up, outright, to the US, or China or even Russia for that matter. Hell in a few decades without the EU we'll also have no influence over India or Brazil. Sure we will do well by aligning with the US but that essentially puts us in a subservient role. We've been able to leverage the EU to have more sway in that relationship than we would have otherwise.

It is also true that Norway is essentially a client state of the EU at this point. They've negotiated a handful of exceptions in exchange for implementing nearly everything the EU has asked for without even having a say in the body.

So not only are the EU giving us less of our money back than what we pay in, when they do give it us back they require that we spend even more to receive our money back in the first place!  Cite, from BBC On the Record, 17.10.99:

&gt; HUMPHRYS:		 			One of the things that 
strikes some people as rather odd about the way Europe works is that we 
give the Commission lots of money and then they give it back to us... some 
of it anyway.  And in many cases we can't get it back unless the government 
promises to match the grants with more taxpayers money.  Well at the moment 
there's several billions of pounds of new Euro-cash waiting to be collected 
by the most deprived parts of Britain.   Terry Dignan has been to Wales 
where people have started asking why the money isn't being grabbed with 
both hands.

&gt; TERRY DIGNAN:				Another coachload of schoolchildren 
arrive at Llancaiach Fawr in the South Wales valleys where visitors are 
whisked back to the days of the Civil War. More than sixty thousand come 
here annually, generating income for an area hard hit by industrial decline. 
 

&gt; ACTUALITY:	 			Welcome you are to my master's 
this fine house. My names is Blethyn, Blethyn Thomas. If you wish I will 
lead you forth within.

&gt; DIGNAN:					The house was restored 
by Caerphilly Council using half a million pounds of European Union money. 
Now the EU is promising West Wales and the Valleys more than a billion 
pounds of extra cash to step up the battle against economic decline.   
    

&gt; ACTUALITY:				Attend to your match. Low upon 
your match. Present your patch to your pan. Fire!

&gt; DIGNAN:					There are fears that, ultimately, 
Wales may see little of this money. That's because it won't be released 
unless it's matched pound for pound by the public sector in Wales. Some 
believe the issue could fatally undermine the new National Assembly's Labour 
administration. Although Wales now has self government, the amount it can 
spend is still controlled by the UK Government in London. It's argued that 
if Gordon Brown doesn't provide the money Wales needs to match the EU's 
one point two billion pounds, the Nationalists, Plaid Cymru will be handed 
a huge propaganda victory.",0,1342171234,null,0,false,0,c5dem39,t3_wg9hg,t1_c5dem39,t1_c5dek34,null,1429365799,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

yeah, because it's not like Rageh Omar or Faisal Islam are neither prominent or muslim.

And I hate to say this, but there is a legitimate concern with some elements of Islam. We're happy to shout down at the bigotry of Christianity when it comes to homosexuality, but to decry that some muslims quote religous texts that say that gay people should be ""thrown from the mountain"" is somehow islamaphobic. I think that it's a legitimate concern that some muslims see this as condoning people doing violence against people based on their sexuality.

And it's disgusting that people may be judged based on their religion, but when some elements of Islam denigrate non-believers (or even people that don't believe in their branch of the islamic tree), using phrases like Kufr or Takfir (the islamic equivilant of no true scotsman), as being second class citizens. How is this not the exact same thing that the article is railing against.

Now I'm not saying that some elements of or society are not prejudiced based on faith, but this paints it as if there are no legitimate concerns at all with Islam, when there are certain branches that need to be scrutinised. Now when you take in to consideration that these branches are very good at proselytising their brand of islam and provide textbooks to UK schools for free on what a ""good"" muslim should believe it is no wonder that there are misconceptions on Islam

But then the negatives come. All the stories, affairs and now (potentially, if proven guilty) this. It doesn't just give him a bad name, it gives Chelsea FC a bad name as well, which is not something I think most Chelsea fans would enjoy. Whenever one of our players fucks up off the pitch, I can't help but groan in despair as once again our name is dragged through the mud. 

The sad truth is that the sports industry seems to be one of the few industries that ""excuses"" this sort of behaviour. If I was found to have racially abused a co-worker, I would most likely be sacked, on the spot without much to complain about. 

So I guess what I'm saying is that, despite all the great games he's played in, the trophies he's won for Chelsea, this could be the last straw in my books.

As for the rest of the Fringe, most children's shows are on in the mornings and early afternoon - the night time is mostly filled up with stand up comedy. Have a look at the pleasance, underbelly, gilded balloon and assembly rooms venues as these are the main four. 

Outwith the Fringe there are the typical tourist attractions like the castle, camera obscura, the royal mile and the museum which are not very far from the grassmarket either.

When I finished reading the article, my immediate thought was, ""Has it been worth it for Warnock?"" When I look at the signings, I think that the back five is looking stronger than I expected it to be, with only a right back urgently needed, although I'd still prefer an extra centre half.

However, the season can still be written off if we don't bring in the necessary midfielders (I believe that Pugh and Green are - at this moment in time - the only senior midfielders guaranteed to be here by the start of the season), and we still need to bring in at least one wide player to replace Gradel, whom we sorely missed last season.",0,1342181209,null,0,false,0,c5dfl25,t3_whu3e,t1_c5dfl25,t3_whu3e,null,1429366255,1,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,1

The FA said that JT's captaincy of England was his until proven guilty, they took it away from him a week later and 6 months down the road he has still not been proven guilty. 

I say it is up to JT to decide when enough is enough and retire his captaincy. And having our name dragged through the mud is not all because of him. And if we did sack him do you think other supporters would criticize us for not standing behind our leader?

Anyway, even if true it doesn't change the basic underlying economics of the fact that London subsidises the rest of the country to a huge extent, so much so that some other parts of the country would not be viable without 'the London pound'.

London provides a net subsidy of 20.3% of GDP. That means one of every five pounds earned in London gets spent elsewhere, if you want to think of it like that. The North West receives a net subsidy of 8.5%. Northern Ireland receives a net subsidy of 29.4%, while Wales receives a subsidy of 26.0% and the North East 22.2%.

http://ippr.org/press-releases/111/8867/osborne-urged-to-invest-in-transport-in-the-north-to-create-much-needed-jobs?megafilter=young+people

*Analysis by IPPR North shows that almost half of major transport projects involving public funding benefit only London and the South East accounting for 84 per cent of planned spending. This is compared to 6 per cent in the North of England as a whole and only 0.04 per cent in the North East.*

&gt;Anyway, even if true it doesn't change the basic underlying economics of the fact that London subsidises the rest of the country to a huge extent, so much so that some other parts of the country would not be viable without 'the London pound'.

I think you're clouding the discussion by intertwining two seperate issues here; how much London contributes to the UK economy, and how much trasnsport subsidy areas receive. 

London is already 'winning' by a huge margin in terms of the amount of subsidy it receives for public transport. Lets make this clear: London has an established and envious public transport system already. 

While London ministers fanny about spending £16bn crossrail, stations, stock and tracks across the rest of the country are falling apart. Manchester Victoria - a major national rail hub - has only just managed to secure a paltry (in comparison) £20m investment for a new roof. It's needed a new roof since 1996 when the IRA bomb blew holes in it. Can you imagine a mainline London station waiting that long for urgent (and they were urgent - glass panels were falling on commuters) repairs?

On the other hand, we've had so-called mundane buys that turn out to be superstars. Sami Hyppia, John Arne Riise, Dietmar Hamann (maybe not, since he had 30 games for Newcastle), Xabi Alonso. Gary McAllister, who almost everyone believed to be over the hill, was absolutely vital to us winning the Mickey Mouse Treble.

Does London deserve extra funding because it produces more, or does it contribute more to the economy because at some point in the 80s or whenever it was decided that we would focus our economy entirely on London and in particular the financial sector? Probably a little of both I guess. 

If we started building an economy that wasn't entirely dependant on finance maybe we'd be in a better shape today, and maybe those other parts of the country you're complaining about would be bringing in more money. You can't have it both ways; either some of the money and business London gets has to go to other parts of the economy or London will be paying more than its gets in.

Quote
&gt; Borini was one of the few things I was excited about for this coming season. What a shame.

Quote
&gt; Borini was a real find. The kid came to Rome keeping his head low. He showed no interest in parties and being seen. Just razor focused. Trains hard. With limited appearances bagged 11 goals accross competitions. He had a low cost contract and a hunger for goal equal only to Inzaghi.

Quote
&gt; Good luck to Fabio anyway. I was a fan but the final third of last season showed real downsides of his game and for that I'm not gutted at losing him, espcially for a desperately neede 13m. I hope he succeeds at Liverpool nonetheless. I'm sure he will as Borini is a player that is impossible not to like!

Quote
&gt; One of the many reasons I don't understand this move is given that Liverpool have Suarez does that not make Borini kind of redundant? His game is similar to Suarez just less technique and skill. Even as a wing forward I could see them hindering each other or at least not complimenting each other. Your typical wing forwards in those systems are just as skillful as #8/#10 midfielders

Quote
&gt; The uproar over Borini has become a bit comical. There has been very little rational and objective reasoning going on. Borini was a good prospect. He was a reserve player at Chelsea. He was on loan at Swansea in the Championship. He had a good season with Roma for a 20 year old. He has 15 goals total in his career (Swansea + Roma). It is arguable whether he would have been a starter for us this season. We sold him at a profit.

&gt; Can Borini become a great player one day? Of course. But we didn't sell a great player, we sold a good prospect.

Quote
&gt; I thought Borini was the future of our attack

Quote
&gt; I will miss him very much. He is an extremely likeable, humble player who will sweat for the team. He is not ever going to be a star, and might not even have been a starter for us but his effort made up for his technical deficiencies. I remember defending him many times last season over his poor first touch and sometimes runs without brains - and given I am a fan of technical players this was a big step for me. It show how likeable he is. Borini is a player you want to succeed.

Quote
&gt; If his brains and heart were equal he would be a very good player. They aren't. He isn't. We got a good deal and on to Destro!

Quote
&gt; While Borini is a terrific talent inside the box and a great runner, Destro is much better attacking from the side, which is what Roma now wants.

Quote
&gt; I am really furious from seeing Borini leaving for no reason !, Borini proved himself last year &amp; scored the most vital goals in the season for the team

The biggest difference is the pacing of the show. The newer shows generally squeeze an entire story into 45 minutes or so whereas the older shows had on average four 25 minute episodes to tell a story so things move a bit slower. The sets, costumes and special effects are much more primitive but I think you'd soon lose yourself enough in the story so that you wouldn't really notice just how bad they really were. I think all true Whovians should experience some if not all of the old episodes as there are some really good ones.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"There's a number of significant flaws in your reasoning here.

Would the rich still fund the NHS if they couldn't use it? What if they prefer the NHS treatment to a private provider? Are they not allowed access to the largest healthcare provider in the UK because of wealth?

In attempting to bring healthcare to the masses, discrimination both ways should be avoided. In having one system, we remove administrative issues such as health insurance and preferential treatment.

If you force the wealthy to pay for the NHS but deny them usage, you're opening the gates to someone campaigning to remove funding for the NHS from those using private healthcare. This would fatally undermine the whole NHS and cause systematic collapse, resulting in a return to square one and set healthcare back a good 100+ years as we no longer have the facilities that were available from before the NHS was created in 1948.

The point of the NHS is that it is a National Health Service funded by all and available to all, paid through taxation rather than donations or private funding. Your habits are your own, you are partaking, largely, in legal consumption of goods and you have paid towards the cost of the NHS through any form of taxation. It seems somewhat masochistic to take your angle of 'I avoid the NHS because I live a bad lifestyle' and I can't really relate to your perspective because I personally believe that the Service ought to be available for all to use no matter what their circumstance.

However, the problems that the NHS faces today have all been caused through deliberate underfunding to restrain expenditure. The Conservatives were never fond of the NHS, it wasn't in line with their ideas for what the NHS should have been and they didn't really want to take all of Beveridge's recommendations onboard for reform of social welfare after the Second World War. It's rather amusing to see the Conservative Party now using Beveridge's name to deconstruct Social Welfare in a rather perverse way. A fully inclusive system though was the whole point behind the NHS and pressure from within the Labour Party and the Conservative Party in the early days of the foundation of the NHS caused the introduction of prescription charges and then subsequent downward pressure to curb expenditure.

A significant injection of capital into the NHS coupled with management reform and a 'group up' analysis of the service would begin to provide answers. We need more doctors nationally to cover growing demand for healthcare, not just at a regional level. Cutting people out of the NHS provides arguments for further deconstruction of the service as being unnecessary and goes against the spirit of the Service.",0,1342197674,null,0,false,0,c5dj4hq,t3_whoop,t1_c5dj4hq,t1_c5derff,null,1429367915,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He's never been given the opportunity to play with a very good squad. He looked his best towards the end of 2010-11 after getting a full season's 1st team experience alongside players like Ashley Young and Stewart Downing, then Villa sold them both and I don't think he was quite ready to fill both of their shoes (far be it from me to sing stewart downing's praises, but he's a very experienced premier league player and knows how to create a chance..even if he can't finish one.) Add to that Bent's extended injury absence and Villa's overall lack of any drive or direction under McLeish and I actually think its rather impressive that his goals/assists stats didn't drop by that much this year, esp. given he saw less playing time. 

Yes, surely you'd have to think that Hazard, Mata, Rami and Sturridge(if he stays) would probably be picked into the team ahead of Albrighton, but from what I know of him he would at least put in a shift in training and keep them honest, and who knows given the step up in quality from Villa to Chelsea his own game could be raised considerably. Also Albrighton is more naturally suited to the right side of attack than Marin, Mata, or Hazard who traditionally have excelled on the Left. Marin, if he reaches his previous levels at Bremen would surely be a magnificent player, but there is no guarantee that will happen this year. As far as Kevin de Bruyne is concerned, though he looks a very exciting prospect, imo demonstrating consistent flashes of quality/ability against Premier League opposition for the past two years is equally as impressive as bossing the Belgian league with Genk. There's no telling how well KdB will do against Premier League sides, he's still a very very unproven player at the highest level.

Besides, the point is not just to have depth to start squad players over your best players, but its also hugely about having serviceable options to start instead of your best players when they are missing through injury, suspension, etc...I think he could do a job off the bench, or starting against lower league cup or premier league opposition from within a talented Chelsea side with a far better manager than McLeish. 

Anyways, its clear he has a lot more development to come if he is going to rise to the level of top 4 starter, but I'm not really chuffed about that. So do players like KdB and Oscar, in fact arguably they have *more* development to come as they've no experience of playing in the premier league whatsoever. The point of signing him wouldn't be to get a world-class right winger who would jump right into the team, but would be to take a £4.4m punt on the guy and try and help him to develop the potential he has shown. It's a gamble yes, but I'd rather make a £5m gamble on Albrighton then a £25m gamble on Oscar.",0,1342198854,null,0,false,0,c5djg5t,t3_wgve4,t1_c5djg5t,t1_c5dii7i,null,1429368080,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

One day, we went out for a walk round the policies, and he told me about all the different farms he'd worked on as a boy - since we could see most of them from where we were standing... He'd said he had wanted to join the army, since a lot of his friends had, but at the time, the farmer he was working for had said to the War Office that he was a ""key man"" so he wasn't allowed to go to war.

Bale, VdV, Ade, even Lennon and Walker can all create chances. But if teams won't come up the pitch against us, Lennon, Walker and Bale can't use their speed to create space. What Modric does is effectively link defense and midfield, and allows us to move fluidly into attacking positions. Without Modric, we'll have to rely on Huddlestone to do that, and while he's very very good at it, I'm not totally sold on him after his string of injuries. It will take time for him to shake the rust off, and there's always the possibility of re-injury. And behind Huddlestone we have... Livermore?

When doing a job the most professional thing to do is do the job in the best way possible and obviously this varies from job to job.

I needed wisdom teeth removing - 9 months of waiting for the NHS, two infections. When they were removed, they did a terrible job, two more infections and an emergency (private) dentist appointment later and it was sorted.

My mother broke her wrist. They put the wrong cast on. Spotted in 2 weeks into the healing process but the left the cast on another 4 weeks. Now she has a deformed wrist and carpal tunnel syndrome because of the wrong cast. She was meant to get physio immediately after the cast removed, but waited 4 weeks for that. Waited 2 weeks for a nerve specialist, 4 weeks for a pain specialist (due to complications from the bone deformity). Now she is waiting another 6 weeks for a consultation for an operation to break and re-set the bone properly. It's been a constant fuck-up from start to finish. My father is half tempted just to fly her somewhere abroad and get the damn thing fixed properly.

I also worked in an NHS hospital for a year, so I have a *LOT* of horror stories, and things are covered up all the time. i.e. they realised that my mother had the wrong cast but covered it up and left it on anyway.

Sounds reasonable, though not completely ambiguous to define. Even so, since the term 'British' is also one of nationality, its usage implies and underlines segregation even when it is not intended.

I usually use the term 'Anglo-Saxon' in this context, though I am aware that it is not so applicable to the highland Scots or Welsh, which do not have such a Germanic ancestry. Due to the large number of ethnic groups that make up the hybrid British ethnicity, it's hard to come up with a snappy term. I suppose that the British race could be defined as the people who are mostly descended from those alive at the time of Robin Hood. So perhaps we can call ourselves 'Merry Men'. Then your statement

It's the pacing of the storylines and of the speech. People really do talk slower in older tv. And the pacing is slower. And the things that terrified kids in the sixties are often plain boring to people who watch stuff like Alien or the Mummy. And it's a lot less dramatized- no dramatic music or cinematic shots.

That up there is why it's hard for ""kids today"" to get into it. Cut me some slack. I thought all tv befofe 1990 was dumb. (of course I didn't realize Star Trek TNG was from the 80s...). So when we say something is good for being in the 60s, that's good praise! Because it's coming from people who judge everything by not just today's standards, but by today's multi-million dollar movie standards. People judge tv shows' special effects against movies.

Even if the takeover happens and we don't need to sell him to bring in funds, I struggle to see him a Leeds shirt past January.

I wouldn't knock the signing of Drury, to be honest, as I think he's still a solid player who did a good shift - by all accounts - last season in the Premiership. The only downer about his signing is that he will probably call time on his career, should we get promoted with his help. Green is also a half-decent signing, but I concede that he's nothing to get the pulse racing. Norris and Varney don't fill me with much optimism, either.

true,seopher,,I Hate Leeds,"I agree with you on our defense, Neil has obviously seen that's historically been our weakest element - even when we were winning we've been shaky at the back.

Ankergren in goal, Naylor, Collins, Richardson and numerous at left back = leaky.

Higgs in goal, Crowe, Paddy, with left back and the other CB position switching around a lot = leaky.

Schmeichel in goal (who I rated highly) with Lichaj RB, Paddy CB, Lowry (and a few others maybe) at LB with a rotating other CB, leaky still.

The fact we're now in a position with Kenny, Drury, Lees, Pearce...  We're getting to a point where we should have a really solid back line.  Hell, if we can get this chap playing in Norway I'm getting more optimistic.

But up front, if Ross goes (which he will), the potential strike-force of Becchio, Andy Gray (ugh), Varney (...) and possibly Somma in 6 months time having not played for nearly 2 seasons...  Well, hardly terrifying is it?

Anyway, yeah, I felt especially in the first series RTD was being far too timid and bringing everything back to the safe comfort of home in the present day because he wanted the broadest possible audience and didn't want to alienate the non-geek non-SF-friendly viewer with too much ""weird alien sci-fi stuff.""  It bugged me the most in ""The End of the World"" which was otherwise a first rate episode but Davies had to have Rose talking to her mum on the phone and then that lame bit at the end.  ""See, it's all right, everything's back to normal!""  *Doctor Who* never felt the need to do that when it was a kids' show.  When they made the new series for a more adult audience suddenly it had to be more cozy and unthreatening, because adults are more set in their ways and squeamish than kids.  

The show got over that problem, though it is still too Earth-centric even allowing for budget limitations.

Perhaps it should be better said that they hide behind their hatred of Islam as a justification of their hate for muslims.

And let's be honest, it sways the other way too. I'm not being a conspiracy theorist but school curriculums and teachers themselves aren't exactly immune from bias, politics and bullshit either. So while we call the creationalist parents crazy (which they are!), any sort of government-prescribed education is also going to be subject to some bias too.

The good: Sylvester McCoy appears as the Seventh Doctor, till he regenerates into the Eighth Doctor. Paul McGann has a great performance, he's a  warm and very caring version of The Doctor. It has the most amazing TARDIS ever! It's like a neo-gothic cathedral inside. There's even a chase scene that doesn't involve running about.

The not so good: The limited CGI effects are terrible by today's standards. The Master is sort of a campy yet greasy character. However, he always was campy.

true,jeannedark,k9,K-9,"Conventions are a lot different than fan mail, fans stopping you on the street, and fans asking for an autograph in a store. Conventions are where everyone who engages in those activities converge in one place. Especially a convention like ComiCon.

Generally, actors aren't paid to go to conventions. They get their hotel room, travel, and meals paid for either by the people making them go (marketing/publicity), or if they were invited as guests of the convention, by the convention itself. The payment they might get is from the autographs that they manage to sell at the convention -- assuming there is a table for them to sign autographs.

It's just mean to assume that an actor should always feel obligated to their fanbase. A fanbase is a show's giant asset, sure. It's also a curse, and at some point you stop being the actor who portrays the character, but the character itself to the fanbase. You get typecast in the industry as similar characters, people say ""Hey, look, it's Doctor Who!"" instead of ""Hey, look, Matt Smith!"". At conventions you are expected to take pictures, sign autographs, attend panels, and be a good representative of your network and to keep personal opinions to yourself so you don't upset the fanbase.

Considering that, it's easy to see where it could get grating to an actor. To expect them to be constantly grateful, personally, to the fans? That's a stretch. Sure, they're grateful for the employment and the job security, but there's aspects to every fandom which can just be grating. To expect them to want to be able to have a few days of private time where they're not constantly in the limelight, to be able to voice their opinion about something without having network or fan backlash? That's not a constant stretch.

Doctor Who does owe a lot to its fans. It is a show that has brought back from the dead and has occasionally underperformed, but it keeps going -- partially because of a strong fanbase in the UK and overseas, partially because it's a national icon because of a shared cultural experience. It's a show that has at some times been very aware of the fact that it was discontinued -- messages like ""Believe in the Doctor!"" can seem almost like a commentary to the viewers than to the characters themselves.

I don't expect any of the actors and actresses that appear on Doctor Who to be constantly grateful for the show's fans. I expect them to be human, and have some days where they just wish they weren't constantly recognized. By being in Doctor Who they clearly knew what they were getting into, but that still doesn't mean that they have to always like it.",0,1342224926,null,0,false,0,c5dq4dd,t3_wh7ps,t1_c5dq4dd,t1_c5dipge,null,1429371285,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It's difficult to say. The closest case is Suarez, but even then the two cases aren't completely linked.

Suarez didn't dispute calling Evra ""negrito"" (although it took him a while to admit it), he simply said he didn't mean it in a racist term. He basically pleaded ignorance based on his foreign culture.

The difference is, Terry isn't disputing saying ""FBC"", he's disputing saying it as an insult, simply repeating what he thought Ferdinand said. To put it into perspective:
S could say ""You are black"", not meaning it to be offensive but someone taking offence
T could say ""I didn't say you are black"" which as a whole is not offensive, but misheard could be offensive.

Ferdinand would have to prove Terry just said ""You FBC"" whilst Terry has to prove he was repeating what Ferdinand said. Both are difficult positions, but what the Suarez case HAS shown us is you don't need to ""prove without reasonable doubt"", you simply need to ""prove within reason"", and then the FA decides depending on the ""balance of probabilities"" (who is most likely telling the truth). Sorry if I haven't quite helped, but the short answer is: Just wait until the FA start speaking.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think people are overlooking how Sandro can get so indisciplined that Harry got onto him. The man needs to learn to hold his ground and not try to win the match single-handedly. The manager we had who 'didn't care too much' about tactics still got onto Sandro for how much he wanders. I admit that we need to recognise him for his great performances. The goal against Chelsea and the performance against AC Milan both stand out, but he does have a tendency to wander too far forward considering his role in the team.

In saying that, I think we need to share the workload between them because Parker is on his way out, and Sandro is the type of player we should really try and hold on to. He's a fantastic asset, just one who needs to be used properly and needs to learn what he has to do on the pitch. We have enough fixtures during the year, I just hope both are happy with what they're given, but I suppose they wouldn't be happy with just Europa League.

Either way, Parker has been fantastic for us, he's a true leader on the pitch. I hope he rubs off on Sandro and we get a young, collected midfielder who can break up opposition play and recycle when we need him. He's more than capable to be that great player that we, and every team, needs.

I remember for years we were crying out for a player like this (Zokora or Jenas just couldn't do it,) and now, in my opinion, we have two of the best in the league. A proper defensive midfielder who can break up play and can still pass it well and create from the possession that they gain. Either way, choosing between the two is a good problem to have.

Cole just another Shelvey?

I could just as easily argue that Adam is not good enough and Henderson is a quality player. There is nothing that tells us that Aquilani is a quality player in England. We need players like Cole, Henderson, Shelvey etc just on moderate wages. 

I've got high hopes for Henderson, Shelvey is still a question mark and Spearing will fill in the gaps when needed (even though he is far from being on the same level as Gerrard and Lucas). However Cole and Shelvey are as far from being similair players as it gets, Cole is more of a Silva/Mata type and can play on the wings. Where as Shelvey is closer to Gerrard. 

I honestly don't care if we decide to sell Aquilani, Cole or Adam. They'll have to outperform their previous seasons by miles if they are going to give any value to this team.

I would throw in the caveat that it's not free for all (do I have that right?) at the point of service like the NHS and is subsidised by private patients (with their insurance premiums) opting for procedures in public hospitals. (Most hospitals here are public) Waiting lists for non-emergency procedures is laughable but if you can afford the private insurance itself, it is relatively cheap and can be written off, largely, against your income tax. Those on social welfare qualify for free care, which is great but there is a large amount in the middle who have neither free care nor private insurance which is always worrying. I'd imagine all of this has some bearing on efficiency.

Like the UK, our health service is being decimated by budget cuts, while public sector wages remain static. Those employed there are in for a big shock in the next few years when their pay is all that is left to be trimmed.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"I noticed that you're only asking for First and Second Doctor stories; I'm almost through the First Doctor myself. By the way, when I refer to serials, I'm talking about all the episodes contained therein, not just individual 25-minute segments. Here's what I'd recommend:

*An Unearthly Child* - The very first story. We meet the Doctor, we meet the first companions, and we get a sense of the dynamic between them all.

*The Daleks* - It's a slog, definitely, but it introduces the Daleks for the first time. Watch it for the historic moment of seeing a Dalek for the first time ever, but only if you're into watching iconic scenes in poorly-paced stories.

*The Aztecs* - Here's a genuinely good story. The TARDIS team goes to the time of the Aztecs, and Barbara is mistaken for a reincarnated hero; she attempts to use her position of power to change the course of history. The pacing here is very grokkable, and the themes and concerns of tampering with historical events feels very modern (see also: ""Time can be rewritten!"")

*Planet of the Giants* - I liked this one a lot, and it's only 3 episodes long. Demonstrates pretty well how clever the show could be.

*The Romans* - A certifiable comedy! I laughed more than I expected, and the plot holds up well enough too.

*The Time Meddler* - Our first introduction to another Time Lord, before they were ever called Time Lords. The chemistry between the Doctor and the Monk is fantastic, and Hartnell's acting is very good here.

*The Ark* - Asks some very interesting questions and the pacing feels like a modern two-parter.

*The Tenth Planet* - The Doctor's first regeneration! Final episode sadly missing, so you'll have to be content with a reconstruction/just the audio.

Hope that list sounds manageable. I only put on stories that exist in their entirety (i.e. not missing episodes), except for The Tenth Planet. Also note that Classic Who this far back didn't have overarching plots or stories going on in a season, so ""important"" episodes aren't so much ""critical to the plot"" as they are ""iconic"" (like ""The Daleks"").

While Dempsey's age seems foreboding, Americans in football have tended to have a lot of longevity. Brian McBride is a very good example. While Dempsey isn't the most technically gifted player around, he does seem to be plenty fit enough to be able to give us a good 3 years of football. I don't expect us to sign him on a long term contract, so that's not bad. 
You also mentioned something about shirt sales and the marketing effect. Shirt sales are just one part of the marketing effect. Unlike Fulham, Liverpool is a big club globally, and our owners' connection with the Red Sox as well as Lebron means that having a star player of the US team will be much more beneficial to us than Fulham. The increased media attention will give us better advertising and sponsorship opportunities, and that is where the real money is.

Further explanation:

In ""Blink"" we have generic angels doing their generic angel thing: find a victim, send it back in time, consume the 'potential energy'. Rinse, repeat.

In ""Time of Angels""/""Flesh and Stone"", we have angels who have a very specific purpose: crash the ship into the mountain so that the leaking radiation can resurrect their brethren. In this case, the humans are no longer merely victims to be consumed, they are a threat: the humans want to shut down the core of the ship (to save the nearby human colonists, obliquely mentioned), which would axe the angels' plans.

For a while I did, I went along to Celtic games while before I could even understand the sport, and i fell in love with the atmosphere.. The electricity only a football match can bring. I remember hearing ""You'll never walk alone"" and being entranced by it, 40,000 people all signing their hearts out was amazing to hear for a boy that young.

For a while this was enough, i supported Celtic and players like Henrik Larrson were my heroes. The family moved back to England, were my Mother was born and began life is Sunderland. I never really connected with SAFC, and would always be watching the SPL when i could get a chance. 

For my birthday one year my dad promised he would buy me tickets to go and see Celtic play in the UEFA cup, so we headed on down to Anfield, Liverpool. A club and city i knew next to nothing about but was still more than thrilled to see the game.

We got to our seats and i looked around Anfield and i remember being blown away by the sea of red and how vocal the fans were. You can imagine my surprise when ""our"" anthem came on and it wasn't the Celtic fans i could hear. From all corners of the ground You'll Never Walk Alone was sang as passionately as any day at Celtic Park. 

I cant remember at what point during the game I realized i had found my club, the team i was to support from that day on. But even when Celtic had won the day and sent Liverpool out, it wasn't happiness i felt, because it was my first taste of defeat i would have while supporting the reds.

I can happily say ever since that day i havn't looked back. I have been treated to some amazing experiences while supporting this great club. Istanbul.. Gerrards FA cup final.. all of our successes.

Sometimes I wonder how much places like Reddit can actually be unhealthy for you. It's one reason why Gallifrey Base is a scary place.

true,frankster,null,null,"The numbers of Statutory Instruments generated has been more or less steady for a decade. (See here for an explanation of what they are: http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/secondary-legislation/statutory-instruments/). In the last few years there is a clearly increasing trend such that the last two years have each set a record and we are on course to do this again this year. I am concerned that Statutory Instruments allow ministers to perform sometimes significant modifications to legislation without having to stand up to proper parliamentary scrutiny, particularly debate.

I am hoping this post will start a discussion as I would like to hear some positive views on this trend. Personally I am deeply suspicious. Are there are any groups that are campaigning against the excessive use of Statutory Instruments? Does anybody know a way of finding out how many pieces of legislation that provide for future use of Statutory Instruments are passed each year? I expect this to be increasing (given that the use of Statutory Instruments are increasing).

Methodology I used to derive the predicted figure this year of 2012: Friday 13th July is day 194 of the year and we currently have 1768 Statutory Instruments so far this year according to http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi. 365/194 * 1768 = 3309.",0,1342252418,null,0,1342274164,0,c5dv9oi,t3_wjjc8,t1_c5dv9oi,t3_wjjc8,null,1429373785,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I'm the complete opposite. I've been hanging around places like Reddit since forever, and I've always been able to just enjoy whatever it is that I'm watching/playing/whatever. If I didn't, then I wouldn't partake in them, simple as that. But I get what you're saying. Sometimes I really feel like people hate certain things because they've read so much about how bad it is(For example, the 1996 movie). I'm sure the movie still wouldn't be a lot of people's bag, but I have a strong feeling that people wouldn't give it so much hate if they weren't constantly told that they should give it so much hate. Not that it's their fault, but it can instill a certain mindset into you when going into something for the first time that can be bad for you.

And I've seen the opposite, too. Where I see something that I think is absolutely awful, but then it turns out that everyone is praising it, and sometimes it feels like a mob mentality praising.

This is also why I try and give people a level headed view of the movie if I see someone who is interested in it. I don't make it out to be amazing, I admit the flaws, but I don't tear it apart as the worst thing in the galaxy, either. I've noticed that a lot of people that end up watching the movie after I talk to them usually end up having a subtle appreciation for it, as opposed to the knee jerk,""DEAR LORD, THAT WAS AWFUL! I HATE MCGANN!""

I think I've gone on a bit of a tangent, but I agree with you. It's the active hate that I don't understand. I mean, I like Star Trek, I love the original and Next Generation, but I'm not overly fond of anything after that. I don't set out to find places where I can talk about how horrible Deep Space 9 or any other show is, especially since I don't know much about them. I just don't watch them as I can't get into them, end of story. Someone doesn't like classic Who or Moffat Who?
