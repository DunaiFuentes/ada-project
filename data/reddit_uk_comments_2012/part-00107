The basic procedure as far as I've seen is:

1) Get some sort of data

2) Make some sort of crazy prediction based on it and ask for money to research it

3) The research council say ""ok, but only if you do XYZ as well""

4) You agree, then basically do whatever the hell you wanted, and barely touch whatever they wanted you to do

5) Use some offshoot of the results you just got to justify asking for more money

6) Repeat.

The problem is that I can't see how else it can be done. Of course, potential success has to be one of the goals for issuing funding. There's no point funding some crappy idea or useless proposal. But at the same time, not all science can be business-driven, and not all science can guarantee results within a 1-4 year funding period. That doesn't necessarily make them less deserving of investment, but it does make it harder to choose where to put the money.

And anyone who thinks for themself immediately gets a ""tin foil hat"" retort. 

The reason so many dutch jews were so systematically exterminated was due to their Dutches ""efficiency"" at keeping logs on who followed what religion. It's fascinating reading the escalation. 

It starts with the Jews being kicked out of the military, few months later all jews are fired from government jobs, 6 months later restriction on movement etc. and from there leads to their execution.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;I still can't find a moral reasoning that would lead me to think paying any more than the legal minimum is the right thing for anyone do, be it an individual or multinational behemoth.

Well I guess I'd make a distinction between the individual and multinational company, because many large companies these days acknowledge they have a sort of social responsibility beyond their shareholders and employees, due to their size and influence. So you get companies trying to do things like reduce their carbon footprint, fund local charities, even if they don't need to. They know that public perception of their activities is key to the government legislating in their favour (or at least not legislating against them).

Now I get what you're saying about the tax system, but consider that it probably is rather complex to change. More significantly, as there is no way to make the 'perfect' tax system you will always have clever people  with very large salaries finding loopholes around them; I think they will always be there for the looking, no matter how well you make the system.

So as long as companies don't want to pay their dues, they will find clever ways of avoiding them. Now the reason I pick on Google is because it has this whole 'don't be evil' thing going on. If your trying to found the basis of your company on morality, why would you shrink away from paying the British people their taxes?",0,1344983194,null,0,false,0,c5t7dpt,t3_y5u71,t1_c5t7dpt,t1_c5sy0dc,null,1429639487,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I just looked over ticket sales for the home opener against West Brom and tickets are still available.  I know you are looking for tickets together, but that shouldn't be a problem.  Like everyone else I would call the ticket office the Wednesday a couple weeks prior to see if they can help you.  Monday and Tuesday are the days members buy tickets and the office is in shambles at times, I had to wait a good hour before I got through for West Brom.

Getting to WHL is pretty easy and everyone has told you how to get there.  It takes about 30 minutes from Earls Court to Seven Sisters, another 15 if you want to catch the train from there.  My personal favorite is to get off at Seven Sisters and walk the high street.  It is 1.5 miles and takes about 30 minutes, it helps me keep a little calm before the game starts.  I would get to the stadium about 2 hours early, go to the Spurs Super Store, and just watch people funnel into the area.

I don't know if you realise this but it mirrors the language of free market capitalism. I think I touched on this. In brief, the pseudo-intellectual they use is one of 'we are all rational free beings making rational choices', and we should leave it up to 'the market' to fix things. The successful have 'won' in the survival of the most fit, the losers by definition are personal failures. For example, the Mit Romneys, Prince Charles and Camerons of this world really do think they are entitled to the luxuries history (warfare and tax evasion) gave them. Cameron's dad worked in a hedge fund that hid money off shore, Romney was similar, Charles Windsor needs no explanation.

The free market also tries to claim that anyone can make it. Those people 'in the gutter' are encouraged to be rap stars, xfactor bimbos, regular bimbos, sports stars, and the like. Nearly all will fail and when that fails they have some menial job working 40 hours a week on low pay. This means they haven't got the money for a house so they are trapped in renting and kind of live this temporary existence. 

Specifically, McDonalds as a company is hideous. It contributes to obesity, low wages, and a deskilling of labour. I find it odd that there isn't really anyone that resembles a chef in any of their restaurants. In general these jobs don't pay enough, that is why the government subsidises these workers with tax credits. 35k might be the average income but half the working population earn less than 12500 (something close to that. WikiP has the full stats). Secondly what a shit life, handing out over priced shoes made in Tailand by under paid workers, and necessarily being involved in the destruction of your own economy. A new Tescos doesn't add to a local economy it takes it away, the same goes for JD Sports or whatever, and even your mortgage. You might pay someone 100k for a little terrace but you'll pay 180k after interest, and that goes one place: to the banks. It's an impossible situation for everyone to escape without revolting (which should be seen as different than rioting, but the 'authorities' would treat it the same). 

Meanwhile we have an education system that doesn't work, it is a glorified creche. They don't tell you anything of politics, economics, and they don't want to teach self directed learning either. Creative, intelligent people would demand more from government, they would also be less likely to suffer social injustices like a prince who doesn't pay tax properly and owns counties but still gets millions in farming subsidies because he can't make it profitable. Oh yeah, and land is squeezed for the rest of us making prices of housing unaffordable to the people that need it most: the people doing 40 hr weeks at 6£/hour. That leaves almost no time for self improvement, nor money. If one is 'lucky' one might be able to get a place at a low quality university on some business course and get into unremovable debt for usually a poor education. One will have the same debt as the person who got into Oxford, about 30k isn't it now?

The truly successful ones will escape, they will be plucked from their communities if they get good grades and end up perhaps in London or some other center of economic activity. Mean while that steady outflow of the best and brightest means that the communities that are left behind become concentrated in the morally bankrupt, the less bright and unsuccessful. Each generation is left with a lower quality of peer group and role models. I think that is the point when the bulldozers come in and build yuppy flats, they call it gentrification. People who do escape or who were never there look back with incredulity and say 'why can't you people just behave!?'. Just like there can only be one a few Rooneys (god forbid there might be more), capitalism systemises failure and limits the number who can be successful whist claiming it is just the natural order of the world.

Which reminds me, Rooney. He swears abusively, fucks prostitutes when he has a wife and kid, he evades tax, he kicks and punches people on the pitch, yet, he is idolised by our culture. But no, no, those in the gutter are there because essentially they deserve to be. Then there is the car. It kills about two thousand people per year, twenty-five thousand are left seriously injured *per year*. I have a damaged neck from being a passenger the other driver was to blame. My dad had two cranial impacts in his youth, my mum has left in a coma for a month before I was born when she was crossing a road and has had two cashes where it wasn't her fault as a driver. This is the type of thing I was alluding to when I said in the 'grand scheme' of things the riots were a sneeze. The car is a serial killer that is again idolised! All that death and injury has to take its toll on society. Anyway I digress a little, but you get my point. The media and politicians (and people in this thread) sharpen their knives to hate on these 'chavs', and are completely oblivious to greater violence and injustice.

Allow me to take you back to December 2011, Liverpool vs QPR at Anfield, the Red's season is beginning to slow a little and Luis Suarez is embroiled in a racism controversy that threatens to take front stage ahead of our performances. Liverpool had started drawing everything at home and needs a win (a good one) against a QPR team looking destined for a relegation scrap. Overall the atmosphere shouldn't have been that great, Stevie was still out and Shelvey had been called back to cover for Lucas.

When I walked in the stadium there was a buzz around, like nothing I had experienced in Australia, you see optimism from Liverpool fans online, wait until you see it at Anfield. I felt like we could've been winning the league, the atmosphere was so good! Then YNWA blasts out, chills of excitement and an overwhelming urge to see the match start.

That game finished 1-0 and QPR had a really strong last 20, and should've scored. We missed a heap of chances, but the goal... Dat feel... Adam crosses brilliantly for Suarez who slots a header into the corner, the crowd erupts! A good 5 minutes of cheering and singing Luis' song before everyone began to settle in to the normal rhythm again!

I'll tell you, that wasn't a great game, the goal was good but not a lot else. Our season nosedived at home after that, dropping points to Blackburn and Wigan in the next 2 weeks and missing penalties like drunk men trying to pee standing. But I am confident the crowd was the same all season. For me, after that experience, I realised what made this club so great. The fans.

- The Girl in the Fireplace: she was the original girl who waited...and he didn't make it back in time.  :(

- Vincent and the Doctor: Van Gogh has always been my favorite artist, and I deal with depression...yeah.  Fantastic episode.

- Journey's End: I loved Donna.  Oddly enough, Catherine Tate's comedy is really hit-and-miss with me, but I freaking loved Donna.  And honestly, the one thing I fear most in life is losing who I am from loosing my memory (via Alzheimer's or something similar).  That just hurt.  

- The Waters of Mars: I love science.  I *wish* something like the rovers had happened when I was young so I could have been more motivated to pursue space travel.  I would have loved to have the chance to be one of the lucky few to set foot on another planet.  Even the Moon would have been nice.  So the sense of motivation that episode held for me was fantastic.  And then at the end...where she sticks to what is right, when even the Doctor has gone against it...wow.  Just a powerful message to the Time Lord Victorious.  

- Human Nature/Family of Blood: John Smith.  I just feel horrible for him.  We get incredible insight into the Doctor and that's fantastic.  Real mix of good and bad emotions with this one for me.

You'll see some videos of him destroying every player he comes up against in that tourname on Youtube although the quality isn't fantastic.

He's only been used in the first team once and that was a pre season friendly vs Walsall last season, he looked sharp when he got the ball but he only played for about 20 minutes.

Mikel/Romeo have a role to play in the first team for sure, when we need to play defensive we can. We know that, we won the champions league doing it.

We have had a long term persecution of a religious minority, a very obvious homosexual prosecution couched in child porn obscenity, they want your internet history and emails, secret courts, military schools are nearing, and the jingoism around the jubilee and Olympics has been palpable. I think in the coming weeks some one is going to have the balls to break a story about London being turned into a total surveillance network under the cover of the Olympics which looks deeply like yet another global conspiracy called [trapwire](http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-free-speech-national-security/what-make-trapwire-story). From leaked intelligence emails we are told every 'HTV' (high value target) is now covered. It includes the London stock exchange and Downing Street, yet the silence on this issue from the media is deafening, and multiple articles have been pulled after publication in Australia.

What ever you think of the corporate-fascist drift in society, there is an undeniable hatred being fostered in a sizeable proportion of the population, and there has been subtle and not so subtle cues. Booing of the home team at football matches has increased in recent years as well as general abuse. Racism is becoming a visible problem there too, as has twitter prosecutions. People taking to the streets last year and rioting is undeniable.

Fewer people are going to university which means more people are going to be competing for jobs that don't exist, the unicorn that is 'growth' isn't returning, and systemically nothing has changed in the banking system.

One of Alex's beautiful free kicks for 2 all. Adrenaline really going now but we were through to the semi's. 3-2 was icing on the cake. Then suddenly 3-3 and 3-4 in rapid succession. Liverpool needed one goal to go through and the momentum was with them. Surely they didn't have it in them to go on and take this tie back. Surely we could hold on.

They explicitly didn't want to release all the cables in-case it put people in danger:

I certainly don't envy their jobs, the stress must be unimaginable.

EDIT: Here's the important part of the Wikipedia article in regards to the safety of people:

&gt;**Informants named**

&gt;Some, including Barack Obama and Hamid Karzai, raised concerns that the detailed logs had exposed the names of Afghan informants, thus endangering their lives. Partially in response to this criticism, Wikileaks announced that it has sought the help of the Pentagon in reviewing a further 15,000 documents before releasing them. The Pentagon said it had not been contacted by Wikileaks. However, blogger Glenn Greenwald presented evidence that the Pentagon had, in fact, been contacted, and that it had refused the request.

&gt;On 11 August, a spokesman for the Pentagon told the Washington Post that ""We have yet to see any harm come to anyone in Afghanistan that we can directly tie to exposure in the WikiLeaks documents"", although the spokesman asserted ""there is in all likelihood a lag between exposure of these documents and jeopardy in the field."" On 17 August, the Associated Press reported that ""so far there is no evidence that any Afghans named in the leaked documents as defectors or informants from the Taliban insurgency have been harmed in retaliation.""

&gt;In October, the Pentagon concluded that the leak ""did not disclose any sensitive intelligence sources or methods"", and that furthermore ""there has not been a single case of Afghans needing protection or to be moved because of the leak."" Both Wikileaks and Greenwald pointed to this report as clear evidence that the danger caused by the leak had been vastly overstated.

So perhaps they didn't do such a bad job after all, but it isn't exactly easy to say either way.",0,1345000330,null,0,false,0,c5tbswi,t3_y830k,t1_c5tbswi,t1_c5tboy8,null,1429641630,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt; What ever you think of the corporate-fascist drift in society, there is an undeniable hatred being fostered in a sizeable proportion of the population, and there has been subtle and not so subtle cues. Booing of the home team at football matches has increased in recent years as well as general abuse. Racism is becoming a visible problem there too, as has twitter prosecutions. People taking to the streets last year and rioting is undeniable.

&gt; Fewer people are going to university which means more people are going to be competing for jobs that don't exist, the unicorn that is 'growth' isn't returning, and systemically nothing has changed in the banking system. Expect shit to hit the fan at the end of the next tax year. You can't fluff collections so easily.

This whole ""Expect shit to hit the fan at the end of the next tax year"" argument is just hyperbole. I don't see anything terrible happening here in Britain anytime soon. I actually think the public are far too complacent else they'd be out in the streets rioting already and I mean on a scale much larger than Tottenham. And this is considering how many unpopular decisions Blair, Brown and Cameron have made; the dramatic rise in costs of living with no end in sight; a double-dip recession; unemployment; and austerity galore.

I think the British public can be compared to a frog. Place it in boiling water and it will leap straight out.

The news papers could have easily made Spurs out to be the bad man saying how bad Togo is and Adebayors trying to help or something by also raising awareness to his charity. Adebayor could be hyped up as a guy playing for his country, Tottenham then have this hyped up striker, the ex striker of Man City when you guys finished above them. ""What a waste of money"" they're now paying YOU to have him and you could really contend....esecially since you have Chelsea reject, the most passionate manager, challenging for Chelsea who just keep buying newer and newer players. Hazard, Aguero, Van persie, Cahill? How much have Spurs spent recently?

I don't know, I guess since Adebayor was greedy that time he pissed off Arsenal for going for more money and celebrating in front of them, kinda dumb move of course. But was he really that much of a prick because he moved for more money? That's pretty much standard now! How much do Nasri, Clichy, Toure give to charity if out of interest?

That's another way of telling the same story, it just focuses on Adebayor's charity instead of Adebayors past. I don't know, it hates on City for their treatment of him, I don't know.

However, my recommendation, especially if you're a person pressed for a little more time, and you want to enjoy a whole new season as it comes out(It will air on BBCA if you have the channel), then I would suggest starting off with season 5.

Season 5, despite what many here will tell you, is designed as a 'jumping on' point. You can quite literally watch from season 5 on and not miss anything, in a similar fashion to how you can watch the beginning of the 'reboot' without having to watch any of the 40 years of history the show has to offer. It's essentially how the show was designed, to kind of 'restart' itself every so often so that you don't need prior knowledge before jumping in. It's really how the show has thrived for so long, because imagine having to catch up on 50 years of history before being capable of watching a new episode!

It's very much like ongoing comic books. You don't need to read Spiderman from Amazing Fantasy #15 onward, you can jump on with Amazing Spiderman #689 and be just fine, even without reading the one just before it. Or watching Star Trek: The Next Generation without watching the original Star Trek, etc.

Another perk to my plan, is you'll have plenty of material to go back, assuming you're only interested in the new stuff(For now!),  you can still go back and watch seasons 1-4 if you really want while waiting for new episodes of season 7.

The previous MD was Johnathan Ricketts. The one before that was Barry Ricketts. The new one is Geraldine Ricketts.

See the pattern? 

While it's not illegal it doesn't mean it's morally acceptable to willingly allow a company to fail so you can save money while you land a large amount of employees into debt. A lot of people weren't paid what they were owed and it took several months for them to see a penny.

What they have done is simply take the high profitable side of the business (The website/online trading) and abandoned the shops to scale down the business and earn themselves more.

There's no job creation going on here when 150 jobs were lost in exchange for 5 new ones.

The fact they owed a large amount of money to overseas investors and suppliers and have now effectively written it off I personally find disgusting. Sure it's great business tactics but it's morally apprehensive.

Also, why as a tax payer are you happy that they owe so much money? 

That doesn't make sense as surely you want all companies to pay the tax they owe as if everyone paid what they owed this country would be in a better state than it is.

&gt;While it's not illegal it doesn't mean it's morally acceptable to willingly allow a company to fail so you can save money while you land a large amount of employees into debt.

Willingly allow a company to fail?  Have a word with yourself.  Do you really think they willingly let a family company fail, only to put it into administration, and then to bail it out.  You're one selfish, conceited asshole.  It sounds like the family has gone through far more than a cashier that only had to go to the bank to get an overdraft on the understanding that they'd filed with the administrators of their previous job.  

&gt;A lot of people weren't paid what they were owed and it took several months for them to see a penny.

That's because it went into administration.  The administrators take over the accounts.

&gt;What they have done is simply take the high profitable side of the business (The website/online trading) and abandoned the shops to scale down the business and earn themselves more.

GOOD FOR THEM!  They taken a broken business model and applied a working one.  Why on earth would they adopt a model proven broken?

&gt;here's no job creation going on here when 150 jobs were lost in exchange for 5 new ones.

They've got to start somewhere.  My first company started off with one employee.  Me.

&gt;The fact they owed a large amount of money to overseas investors and suppliers and have now effectively written it off I personally find disgusting. Sure it's great business tactics but it's morally apprehensive.

They've not declared bankruptcy by all accounts.  They've hardly written it all off, they'll have had to put together a rescue package together to take it out of administration. 

&gt;Also, why as a tax payer are you happy that they owe so much money?

Because if they'd declared bankruptcy there'd have been no way for the taxpayer to get it back if it was a limited company and they were covered by their limited liability.  By going into administration and then coming back out the taxpayer won't be shafted.

Seriously.  You're not thinking any of this through.  Even your Cybug comment shows the naivety yu hold for the pressures of a business.  Sure a single one may cost a fraction but they'd have had to buy in bulk from a wholesaler and then had to address the immediate cash flow problem it would produce.

Seriously? What's this about?

Xavi does not play in the same part of the pitch as Mikel. 

Barcelona dominate possession in all of their games. Comparing what Mikel does to what Xavi does is futile their roles are different. 
 
Xavi is a player you want on the ball. Mikels job is to get the ball to players we want on it. He doesn't do this quick enough because his touch is rubbish. And the majority of his passes are backward. He also loses the ball a lot when he tries. Putting our Defense under pressure  and on the backfoot.

As I have explained I know why he is on the pitch. 

I have not called him useless. 

Mikel has not shown he is versatile. Perhaps in glimpses but his consistency has been dreadful over the last six years.

I've been through this a million and one times at this stage. So have a lot of other people. But you just keep claiming we don't know what were talking about. Read the arguments. Other people word things betterly than me.
 

Let me put it this way, Lampard will be playing in the pivot yes? Will he be giving up all defensive responsibility on him in a crucial role on the pitch because he is the player who deals with the offense? No. Why not? Because it's Handicapping. 

The heading of this thread is why do Chelsea fans think John Obi Mikel is not good enough? I've given my reasons. I'm not Mikel bashing. As a person, I like the guy. I'd love to see him be good enough. But he hasn't been. Not top top level. Until/Unless he shows us on a consistent basis that he can be I will not be happy. He plays a crucial role. A role where performance/consistency has a massive effect. In defense, AND in attack. ",0,1345023075,null,0,false,0,c5tfzbu,t3_y62jd,t1_c5tfzbu,t1_c5t5yea,null,1429643600,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

&gt;An estimated 10,000 playing fields were disposed of between 1979 and 1997 when the Conservatives were in power.

And then we have successive governments who raise fees for an education that they got scott free. So they claim they're making tuition 'more competitive' and 'expanding on the Olympic legacy' with one hand while dismantling infrastructure with the other.

&gt;Figures from the DfE also show 213 playing fields were approved for sale between 1999 and April 2010, under the last Labour government.

Britain is supposedly renowned for its tolerance and maintaining a moderate line - some of these things are ridiculously draconian. I think the time has come where we can no longer lay claim to such a statement. Britain is going backwards, and there's not a thing the average citizen can do about it.

&gt;The link I provided says that it was a family business and brought out of administration by the mother! There is absolutely no problem there whatsoever. It is in fact something that should be commended; family enterprise is what this country needs more of. A nation of greengrocers and cottage industries once more. They're the potential net employers on a nation scale; small-medium sized enterprise.

Well that's fucking commendable. I could agree with that if it wasn't for the fact that they dropped their debt. All that money that owe in to suppliers too(People who need to be paid too. They don't magically have stock to give out). They didn't take the debt - simply the company assets. How can you agree with that? 

But you know what fine I'll play this little game with you. 

&gt;Willingly allow a company to fail? Have a word with yourself. Do you really think they willingly let a family company fail, only to put it into administration, and then to bail it out. You're one selfish, conceited asshole. It sounds like the family has gone through far more than a cashier that only had to go to the bank to get an overdraft on the understanding that they'd filed with the administrators of their previous job.

Yes. Willingly. In fact ""encouraged"" would be the word. This isn't a greengrocers or newsagents ran by auntie fucking sue. They aren't struggling to get by; they are doing their upmost to line their pockets without any concern for who they use or what happens. The advantage I have over you is I was there - I wasn't someone selling at a shop counter - I was the guy running their site and turning the damn thing around. Unlike you, Mr.self proclaimed business guru, I know what happened first hand.

Also, stop putting so much stock into the phrase ""Family business"" as it's marketing spin. No one likes the scary corporate side of things.

&gt;GOOD FOR THEM! They taken a broken business model and applied a working one. Why on earth would they adopt a model proven broken?

No, what they did is take all the profits from the shops and top it off by not having to pay yearly rates/rents etc for the buildings even though the shops weren't failing by a long shot.

USE OF CAPS -  You can drop the strawman antics if you want but hey we can continue.

Sitting in a Starbucks and making an etsy shop doesn't count.

Christ for someone who complains about ad hominem fallacies you do seem to love using them - so I guess that's the favour returned. 

&gt;They've not declared bankruptcy by all accounts. They've hardly written it all off, they'll have had to put together a rescue package together to take it out of administration.

They don't have to - they WENT INTO ADMIN. That money isn't going to be seen again. The administration company handling it have sold off all the remaining business assets to earn money (73k) towards their debt but that's it. Which means a company with assets worth close to a 
£950,000 has just sold them for a ridiculous price.

&gt;Because if they'd declared bankruptcy there'd have been no way for the taxpayer to get it back if it was a limited company and they were covered by their limited liability. By going into administration and then coming back out the taxpayer won't be shafted.

We're still shafted, genius. The phoenix company has not taken on any of the debt. You think it's OK just to drop a company because it's insured? When times go hard for your little fruit stall are you going to just burn it to the ground just because it's insured?

&gt;Seriously. You're not thinking any of this through. Even your Cybug comment shows the naivety yu hold for the pressures of a business. Sure a single one may cost a fraction but they'd have had to buy in bulk from a wholesaler and then had to address the immediate cash flow problem it would produce.

Over the period of 1 year and 6 months 80 of these were sold. The spent £32,000 in total for them. The only winner here is the Phoenix company who got them at a knock down price.

Yeah taking the warnings into account, that the bills that need to be paid, taxes are owed, suppliers want their money...who could have fucking guessed it.

&gt;So now you don't even have first hand knowledge of what happened in the last weeks, or when people filed with the administrators for their compensation. They could have ended up waiting several months because they left it several months.

I had it first hand from the management there as I was, and am, in touch with them. So more in the know than you, chum.

Make sure you don't just pick and choose bits of it. if it's going over your head please feel free to ask and I'll clarify.

I address exactly what the business is doing and counter your personal attack on the restart of a business, but seemingly your own personal attacks on a business which you don't seem to understand gets a by according to you.

&gt;Well that's fucking commendable. I could agree with that if it wasn't for the fact that they dropped their debt. 

No they didn't.  They went into administration, not bankruptcy.

&gt;They aren't struggling to get by; 

Clearly they were.  They owed the tax man and creditors.  They clearly had a cashflow problem. 

&gt;The advantage I have over you is I was there - I wasn't someone selling at a shop counter - I was the guy running their site and turning the damn thing around.

You just said you left before they collapsed.

So you were the one helping to turn a business around and you left midstream.  Having said that you seem unaware of basic business practice so I'm struggling to find this claim credible.

&gt; Unlike you, Mr.self proclaimed business guru, I know what happened first hand.

Only you just claimed to have left before they got into trouble.  You just got through saying you were the one turning it around.  You've also just said they weren't in trouble so what you were turning around heaven only knows...

&gt;No, what they did is take all the profits from the shops and top it off by not having to pay yearly rates/rents etc for the buildings even though the shops weren't failing by a long shot.

That would be criminal and they wouldn't have been covered by their limited liability in such a case, which clearly they were because you've just said what they did was not illegal but to your mind immoral.

&gt;&gt;""GOOD FOR THEM! They taken a broken business model and applied a working one. Why on earth would they adopt a model proven broken?""

&gt;...USE OF CAPS - You can drop the strawman antics if you want but hey we can continue.

That wasn't even remotely close to being a strawman.  It doesn't mean what you think it means.

&gt;They don't have to - they WENT INTO ADMIN. That money isn't going to be seen again. The administration company handling it have sold off all the remaining business assets to earn money (73k) towards their debt but that's it. 

Again, you don't seem to know what going into administration means, but if the administrators sold off all their assets and only made £73k, when they owed a million, clearly there was a significant problem and they had to go into administration - that and you weren't turning around shit.

&gt;Which means a company with assets worth close to a £950,000 has just sold them for a ridiculous price.

Again (a) the administrators sold the assets, (b) you just told me they rented their shops and their products were cheap with a huge mark up.  It sounds like you've just confused debt with assets.

&gt;We're still shafted, genius.

Like the epithet but you can drop the inclusive ""we"".  You just said you left the company earlier for another job.

&gt;The phoenix company has not taken on any of the debt.

Why would it if it's a separate company only trading under a similar name if it doesn't have to?  That's business 101.

&gt;You think it's OK just to drop a company because it's insured? When times go hard for your little fruit stall are you going to just burn it to the ground just because it's insured?

That was in response to me using the term 'limited liability'.  You obvious don't know what limited liability means either.   Limited liability means the owner has limited liability for the debt of the company as long as they don't do anything illegal or intentionally harmful.

&gt;Over the period of 1 year and 6 months 80 of these were sold. The spent £32,000 in total for them. The only winner here is the Phoenix company who got them at a knock down price.

There you go.  You've just shown me how they had a cashflow problem, the problem with their business model, and why there was such a mark up.

&gt;Once again coming from you - laughable.

Learn what the terms administration, liquidation, bankruptcy, limited liability, assets and cashflow mean, and their implications.   You clearly don't at the moment.

While you're at it decide whether the company was in trouble, in the process of turning around, or was deep in the mire, and whether you were there when this happened or not, as at the moment you're contradicting yourself *a lot*.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"That's never been any different though, we used to burn crazy people at one point. 

One interesting argument I've heard is that humans are biologically hardwired to dislike people who are seriously ill by feeling disgust. It's a hardwired function to provide some protection against contracting illness and to protect the group. And it applies to mental health issues as well, because both consciously and subconsciously we can tell there is something wrong with a person and the disgust/alarm mechanism kicks in, which is why we shun people with mental health issues.

The mechanism has been looked at by quite a few scientists, and has been called the ""[behavioral immune system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_immune_system)"", and you can read a little bit about it [here](http://m.thetyee.ca/News/2012/05/19/Immune-Fear/) and [here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-behavioral-immune-system). And it seems to form the basis for cultural prejudices. The behavior is common in other animals so it's not even something unique to humans, just a very basic way of ringing alarm bells in your head if something looks like it might be unhealthy (which is why you notice and feel wary of a man shuffling down the street ranting at pigeons). And while this worked quite well when we lived in caves and died at the slightest thing, it doesn't work so well in a 21st century urban environment where we understand that mental health issues aren't contagious or harmful (with obvious exceptions). 

I'm pretty sure someone will be along to tell me I'm a terrible person and that no matter how I argue there is no excuse for hate crimes, but that's missing the point entirely. Surely we want to know why disabled people have problems such as being the victims of hate crimes, and look into ways we can use education to override hardwired functions which might form the basis for ignorance which leads to people attacking and abusing those who have mental health issues. It's all very well to think a behavior is wrong, but you need to understand why it exists before you can change it. Just making laws and saying how you think people should act never works that well.

That's being dishonest.  It's systematically going through every point.

&gt;contradicting yourself,

You're projecting because I've just said the same thing to you, only I was able to back it up by addressing specific points.

&gt; To the best of your knowledge you're being told first hand by someone there what was happening 

No, you just said you left before this happened.

&gt; what was happening internally but you're fixated on your set view being right you fail to be able to embrace the possibility that you are wrong.

I'm quite happy to acknowledge if I'm wrong.  I even started off with stating 'unless there's more to this', the only thing is you've not been able to bring anything more to it.  If you can, please do so.

&gt;The website was making money; it wasn't before I started.

Great, but they also had tens of shops that clearly weren't.  In the new model you've also just said that they're adopting the internet approach 100% over highstreet locations.  

You should be applauding that.

&gt;That, I turned around.

So when you were there you had no first hand knowledge of what was actually costing the company money.  You're basing it all off the knowledge that you have that happened to be making money.

Thank you.

&gt;after I left though they stuck kid Ricketts in charge and crashed out their PPC/Affiliate campaigns. COSTING them money.

Costing them potential revenue.  The premises cost them actual money.

Thank you.

&gt;Your WHOLE argument is based on picking on points where I haven't been 100% explicit because I assumed you not be partially retarded and to actually learn from this.

Again, that isn't a straw man argument.  Where you have gone on to explain yourself it shows that either you weren't in the know, don't know what limited liability means seemingly linking it into business insurance, 

&gt;Obviously not. Feel free to go for the last word though; you desperately appear to crave it.

Thank you.

You don't understand business.  You don't understand limited liability.  You don't understand what going into administration means, or why it is that it is there to protect business owners so they don't lose their shirts and can start up again.

Businesses that have come out of administration and are trying to make a go of it shouldn't have vendettas held against them by uninformed, bitter people.  I'm glad my initial comment took top spot to address and offset the attack not just on this business but all start-up businesses and those struggling in harsh economic times.

Your typical Premiership matchday starts on the weekend, waking up, switching on the sports news or the radio and listening to the pre-match build up. You meet with friends and get to the ground early. There are 40,000 people discussing who they would play, what went wrong in the last match, it's a pretty chilled atmosphere until you get into the ground and then you know that a job needs to be done. Obviously, bigger games like your derbies and rivalries are much more tense and the noise is lifted. But a typical matchday is just busy, there are people cramming into nearby pubs, buying badges and programmes. After the game people flock out and weave between traffic getting back to their cars or trying to get on public transport.

Champions league games are much more tense. Especially knock-out games. In the build up you see the rare group of away fans meandering through Liverpool city centre, the day is spent speculating, obsessing and worrying about the game later on in the evening. The atmosphere is greater essentially because the stakes are higher, it's not a weekend so it's much busier and more hectic getting to the game. The best atmosphere I've experienced was at the 08/09 semi final against Chelsea when we sang You'll never walk alone for about 6 minutes.

I'm pretty skeptical that religion can be ""eliminated.""  I just don't think thats the way humans work.

It's not universal to all people but it is a recurring feature of humans with repeating patterns.

Just watching the fervour for the Olympics made me recognise if not the seeds of religion then the echoes of its form.

I have a problem with aggressive atheism that seeks to destroy religion in a dismissive way. Debate is far healthier and also humility at the mystery of existence.

Also there is an error in thinking that we can live only by science. We still need philosophy which is really the starting point for everything. Science, logic and reason can never be our starting point.

I've since been told from somebody that worked on their internet side of sales that that was the one part of the company that was turning a profit, and that coming out of administration that is what they're embracing.

I know it's better for a struggling company to go into administration early to avoid bankruptcy and to come out as a tax payer and an employer embracing a working model, than it is to see the whole thing die.  I know a family company, that so far nobody has shown me to have be prosecuted, should be applauded for taking the company out of receivership and starting over again but with lessons learned.

Get pissed at night, take turns in the day to steer and navigate the locks, pull up every day at a new place and just have fun within your group, each night at a new selection of country pubs with local girls/boys.  Every day is new.  You'll have your own digs as well so if you want to take any girls/boys back you're golden.

East Anglia is awesome in the summer.  Pile up.  Chip in for a boat.  Have a fuckin' laugh.  It's different too and, unlike an endless motion of piss ups from city to city, it's something you'll all remember.

That was always the case. What has changed is we don't have coal mines anymore. It is remarkable the economy has grown in a transition towards a ""zero unskilled employment"" reality at all. Since the 70s we've apparently seen a holocaust of unskilled work, a massive increase in work with an education requirement and a simultaneous holocaust of secondary education. I'm impressed we've managed to survive such a thing.

There was no grand past where these problems didn't exist. If we had the grammar school system right now the economy would tank from the sudden 20% less of population going to university.

Most of the stuff Beattie moans about is good honest cheating though. Admittedly it'd be great if referees pinged idiots lying in front of the 9 but while they aren't it is honest cheating.

The way I see rugby cheating is if you want to stamp it out then referees need to work harder. Most cheating exists in rugby because the various unions have explicitly told referees to allow that leeway because ""well that is the game isn't it"". It is why rugby is such a different game between nations. Each union has a different book of what proper cheating is and referees are guided so as to be blind to it.

The correct way to fix this is top down. Not telling players not to cheat. Any player that doesn't use all that he has available is a fool and soon to be a losing fool.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;When you're loaded with that much debt - maybe into your 40s, how the fuck are you expected to make any further progress in life - getting on the property ladder, or accumulating any savings or pension funds - on an average-ish salary. Because not all graduates will be bankers/lawyers/doctors on 6 figure salaries.

I belive this is what the OP was talking about as 'scaremongering'.

For starters, *student loans do not affect your credit rating* (note that bank loans you might get for pay for tuition may). So reguardless you never have to worry about the size of your student loan having a negative influence on your life.

Second, the size of your salary means practically fuck-all. It is essentually a graduate tax on earnings, so if you earn nothing (e.g. you become a charity volenteer or get married and have kids, having no career), you pay nothing until it gets wiped - 30 years later I think.

When you start earning you only pay on what you earn above £21k; that means most people will pay nothing/very little in the first few years of their employment.

Those on 'six figure salaries' will pay substantially more, and also be subject to much higher interest rates on the remaining balance, encoraging them to pay it off faster (and thus effectively subsidse the pooer end of the employment scale).

&gt;Voting for the tories is basically robbing your kids of a future, ensuring that only the richest few percent will have any access to decent education, healthcare, or transport.

At the age of 17/18 you are *not the person you are right now*. Very few have the savvy to be able to properly assimilate all their options and make the right choice on a long term basis (especially with the playing field, goals and options all changing, all the time). Couple that with an immature desire to have some fun, enjoy being out of a more severe school system and into a life where you can get away from your parents and do as you please... and what do you get? A really attractive case for university where you get all this and more assuming you can afford the entrance costs. 

I can remember quite clearly (at college) being told *nothing* of my options or how things worked. I didn't know. I went to University because my friends wanted to and because it seemed like the next logical thing to do after finishing secondary school. I didn't know what I wanted to do career wise and I didn't have the funding to just kick back and do nothing... so I went back into education with the additional promise of some freedom. 

Fact is - I'll admit I was clueless, I'll also say I don't consider myself the most stupid of people either. I didn't know what I wanted and I didn't know how to make the choices that were there to be made. Apprenticeships? Unheard of! 

So if I can say that... what of everyone else? I'm not even amongst the beer swilling, peeing-on-a-fountain brand of students that exist out there.

I wouldn't say my family's poor, we've got a large house, garden, expensive china, grand old furniture, silver cutlery/candle sticks/etc, yet we earn about £18,000/year (dad's retired). My grandmother's got an estate of about £600k+house, and my dad's got about £75k in savings and shares.

There's a lot of help for students with families of a low income, the debt isn't like a normal loan where it can affect your credit rating, getting a mortgage etc, as well as being written off after 30 years.

If you honestly think people doing Engineering or Physics have the time to do a significant amount of part-time work (assuming they can even find it, and have an employer that doesn't want them to be flexible and miss lectures (you aren't allowed to miss lab hours)) then you truly are disconnected from reality.

Besides should our students be struggling to get by and taking unskilled work whilst we have many unskilled workers left unemployed or should they focus on their studies and then go and be more successful engineers etc. which will bring a greater return to the country in the long run?

Well thank you for disclosing the voting campaign.

&gt;'TJBlake' or 'agent' or whomever you want to post as. You know fuck all.

Clearly I've got you riled enough to know something.

&gt;These sods drive around in brand new jags and land drovers. They are not fucking hard done by in the slightest. 

I'd hope they're not, but as a limited company if you feel that they're done anything illegal and personally attacked the source of their Jags then you should consult HMRC.  If so they're facing jail time.

They've gone into receivership, come out of it, and unless you tell me otherwise, they're not facing jail time.  So what does that tell you?

Be rational, now.

&gt; I've had my own business for 15 years now and times are hard. But not if you game the system as they have done. There are reasons why they have been under investigation under different names.

So what are the results of the investigations, and why if you've been working for yourself for 15 years have you watched family work for them?

&gt;Your little 'digging' has done sweet bugger all except highlight what a little upstart you are. It's not even correct.

My explanation of limited liability isn't correct?  15yrs in business...seriously?

&gt;'Lost wages' don't make me fucking laugh. Where were the promised bonuses, holiday pay, and actually God damn hours? You don't work 45 hours to be paid for 20.

Under administration.  If before then then where is the tribunal?  Show it and I'll acknowledge it, but going on a witch hunt because you don't appear to understand what administration means - yeah, you're not on a autobahn of making me understand.

&gt;Do us all a favour and stop trying to distort facts and shut the fuck up you little cunt.

Seeing as you just called me 'son', that's no way to talk to your offsprings, mother.
 
I blame the parents.

Devil's Advocate time! Or, at least, giving you an idea of what the Bulls would reply:

""No we are not discriminating against their sexuality. We would let gays stay, in a twin or two separate rooms. Just not in a double bed because it is against our religious beliefs.""

Of course, I take great joy in replacing the word ""gay"" with ""black"" or ""Jew"" or ""Irish"", but then I'm a cynic.

With regard to your last paragraph: The couple in question *were*/are civil partnered. It made not a jot of difference because the Bulls claim remains ""they weren't married"".

But that raises an interesting issue: some people, including some Christians (particularly those against allowing homosexuals to marry) argue that a civil partnership is the same as a marriage - it gives the same rights etc. (it doesn't, not completely) and is essentially marriage in all but name. But of course they don't want the word used by gays.

And here on the other hand we have some Christians who claim that ""no, a civil partnership is not the same, so they are not properly married"".

I would dearly love to see a discussion between these two groups and see how they attempt to justify their positions to each other.

Pal.

&gt;Make sure you don't just pick and choose bits of it.

Nope, that's why I'm making sure to address every bit and why you are wanting to condense it down...

&gt; if it's going over your head please feel free to ask and I'll clarify.

Clarify to me again what 'limited liability' means, because that bit where you thought it meant private insurance was a peach!

&gt;I'm doing this not out of spite but for the fact when they went into admin who do you think lost out on purchases and orders for that week hmm? (Here's a hint - the customer).

Don't worry.  They were insured in the very real sense.  Credit cards do that, and for cash Caveat Emptor.  Companies are at themselves liable to issue credit.  That's what unsecured credit means.  It's sad to see a business go under, but that is what it is.  Business goes up and down.

&gt;Amusingly ill informed too.

What, you don't think going into administration is bad for business?  It's a last measure before bankruptcy!!!

&gt;&gt;The problem is you don't seem to know the first thing about business.

&gt;Ironyyyyyy.

Explain to me again, oh web developer, what limited liability means, because you seem to think it means burning down a building.  You went from working there and turning it around to saying they had to ditch their highstreet shops and only embracing the Internet, which you yourself was profitable, whilst acknowledging they made massive losses in other regards...and then complaining about it.

AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE, BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION!

Strange how I can actually show how you are contradicting yourself however:

- You were there, but you weren't you left early.

- They were doing great, but they had a cash-flow problem you describe and they owed ~£1m whilst  the legally empowered administrators (so not the company) could only sell, your amount, ~£75k of assets.

- The company didn't pay out for months, but they were under administration, so couldn't legally pay out and it would be the administrators that would eventually pay out what could be paid out.

- They were a limited company but you blame them for claiming limited liability (Seriously, you're going to have to at least wiki that one to get the reference).

It goes on...

&gt;I left as soon as I knew there were issues and had the information taken straight from the team I worked with.

So you contradict yourself again:

- You were 'turning it around', but left as soon as you knew there were issues.

What were you turning around if you leave as soon as you know there were issues?

&gt;How did you draw that conclusion? Forget it. Unless I explicitly mention it you just seem to deny the possibility.

You said that you worked on the e-commerce side of things.  They cut their shops and have relaunched their e-commerce side of things.  Clearly you are only privy to one small aspect with limited business acumen and basing everything off that.

&gt;So I'll elaborate picking on points and MISREPRESENTING or TWISTING what I've said.

You'll elaborate on points you have misrepresented or twisted which YOU'VE said????

&gt;&gt;You don't understand business.

&gt;Unfortunately it is you who doesn't understand it. Blithly claiming I don't while I explained various points only undermines you.

Please, IT department, explain limited liability and corporate administration again.

&gt;You, Jon Snow, know nothing about what happened. Yet will make up points, facts, or twist how the legal process works just to seem right. To defend this virtuous family business that exists in your head and not in reality.

Not a business.  All business principle as it has been played out.  You just have sour grapes.

Isn't it? But you're rather extending this further than it needs to go. As I said - the information wasn't made available to me and I didn't know what I needed to know that I needed to know.

Thing is, we don't have alot of leverage on this one.  In all honesty Real don't need Modders, they have plenty of weapons in CM without Modric.  If they feel they need help they can go and pick another player (like Dembele) for cover and still compete for La Liga and CL titles.

Spurs on the other hand now have a player who has made it clear doesn't want to stay who's antics are wearing thin on coach, chairman, club and fans. Add to that his market is actually fairly small, given the money we are wanting it puts his prospective buyers at Chelsea (who seem to have lost interest and who we don't want to sell to), Man United (who we don't want to sell to), Man City (who we don't want to sell to), PSG (who just spend 40m on Lucas), Barca (who don't seem interested), Malaga (who's money went tits up), Inter (who don't seem interested) AC Milan (who don't seem interested) and Real (who is interested but don't have a dire need).... so our choices become to take as much as we can and try to go get the striker we seem incapable of getting or hold onto him as his value drops.

I would prefer we were able to work something out to have Modders stay that doesn't seem like it will happen.

... It's hard to know where to start with that one. Would a black man who is refused service in a shop, and is told it is because of his skin colour, belong to a ""special interest group""? I really, *really* recommend you review the way you view minorities. The more I think about those three words together, the more I'm dumbfounded that you view people that way. It's really not healthy, imo. Moving on...

&gt; target people 

The couple/B&amp;B wasn't targetted by the two men in question, nor were they out to prove a point nor backed by Stonewall etc. Also, it should be clear from this quote by the gay couple that they were not in it for the cash:

&gt; [""We brought this case to clarify the law, not to make money. We have always believed that the original award was a fair one, and are not seeking any further compensation.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12711954)

They didn't seek out the B&amp;B either. They booked a weekend break, turned up and were then turned away.
    
&gt; ""Up front and honest""

They weren't. Their website/advert said nothing about it, nor did they have literature/signs in the hotel, I believe. Guaranteed if they had then they would have answered to the authorities, most likely, long before the two gay men got anywhere near the place. Also, [given the information I linked in another comment](http://www.secularism.org.uk/christian-hotel-owners-claimed-i.html), it is perfectly clear that the Bulls were not undertaking this ""deeply held conviction"" until they were presented with a gay couple.

&gt; Then hurt those people as much as possible using whatever instruments they have at their hand

*Really*? Wow. I wonder if you'd say the same thing if a mixed race or black couple were turned away. Personally I am of the opinion (because it is what the gay couple have said) that such people are challenging discrimination rather than trying to hurt the discriminators.

&gt; This wasn't about rights

Yes, it was and is.

&gt; This was all out gang warfare.

Hardly. Where are you getting this idea? Not from an objective stand point: i.e. factual. In any case, even if it were, on the one side you have equality, fairness and inclusion while on the other you have discrimination, inequality and ostracism. Which is more morally sound, in your view and why can't the other be challenged?

&gt; Surely the fight for equality is about damping hatred, not amping it up? 

I really don't see how that should mean that 'therefore society should ignore prejudice and illegal activity'. You seem to be under the impression that homosexuals aren't discriminated against in a variety of ways. They are, even now. It's still a battle, particularly with religious groups who, on occasion, [are granted loopholes in equality laws](http://www.lawyerssecularsociety.org/default.asp?sectid=393). Awesome.

&gt;  If gays can be accepted and tolerated isn't that enough?

It would be, yes (see edit below). But it's not the case that they are, is it? In this hotel: gays are not accepted unless under specific criteria. They are not being tolerated, because the owners are not treating them in the same way they would treat a heterosexual couple. I really don't see how you can't understand the issue - homosexuals are not being treated in an equal way to straight couples: that is text book discrimination.      
*edit - I should add a note: ""tolerated"" in this sense is a word that carries baggage, as the implication is that religious people (or society) is somehow being damaged, or upset, by homosexuality. In fact I question its use in this case.*

&gt; Why stick the boot in and destroy anybody who isn't actively fighting your corner?

Destroy is a very strong word and completely over the top for this situation. Hall and Preddy weren't trying to sue the Bulls for every penny, or similar, nor have they tried to have them shut down. No-one has, to my knowledge.     
Also, your implication that the Bulls were sitting there being all neutral is entirely at odds with the situation: they weren't being neutral, they actively discriminated.

I apologise if this comment comes across as ranty, though I would be justified if I had raged, but your opinions/questions are so wrong that I have to wonder where you got your information. I really would like to know, actually, what you've heard about this case in the past and from where.

A simple scan of the facts, you see, renders your position untenable.

Anyway, I think Moffat is one of the best things to ever happen to the show, and that he really has moved it on to a new level in terms of quality.  Although the show was immensely fun in places, I felt it had become rather childlike under RTD, with some incredibly lazy deus-ex writing, and sub-soap-opera-like tweeny melodrama.

For me, all Moffat needs to do is BAN all of his writers from using the 'think thoughts of love to defeat the enemies' ending (I'm staring accusingly at you, Gatiss) and everything will be ticketty-boo.

For example, if you're travelling around south Wales by train, the only train companies that actually pass through there are ATW and First Great Western (Intercity 125s). Anybody with half a brain knows that if you want a seat, breathing space, air conditioning, a noise lower than 100dB, and a train that isn't absolutely filthy, you will wait for the FGW service.

First Great Western don't really *want* to provide services further west than Cardiff, because they don't think it's their responsibility to do what they call 'local' services (that is, shorter journeys in and between towns that take ~10-15 minutes) with these great big hulking trains, when this is the kind of thing that ATW should be doing.

Except ATW know full well that they can't deliver on this, as their trains are small, dirty, slow, and too few in number, so they basically guilted FGW out into continuing their (probably non-cost-effective) routes from Camarthen to Cardiff because otherwise nobody would be able to get to work. They continue to give FGW a raw deal as all major stations in south Wales are staffed by Arriva, so they never know what the hell is going on (the networks don't talk to each other). The end result is ATW can continue to provide their shitty service and not have to invest in improvements to their 1930s hell carts, because they know that FGW clear up the mess from their lack of seats every day at 5:30pm.

&gt; Well I don't think it should be unlawful, is the point.

Indeed, no! Actually I just came back on here to edit my earlier comment to acknowledge that ""Of course quoting legislation doesn't address the reason as to *why* it's illegal"". However, my intention was to list other possible discrimination examples to hopefully demonstrate why this case is discrimination.

&gt; they could stay in separate rooms, just not together

That's what was claimed, though I believe the B&amp;B was fully booked so Hall and Preddy were unable to stay in any case. Assuming that's what happened (I think it is, but I'd have to go digging) then it's then a case of ""we said, they said"", so I'm not sure if we can use it. At the same time we should remember that the Bulls didn't turn away an unmarried straight couple a few years before.

&gt; This is barely even discriminatory.

Though the instances of such activity in the UK is limited/non-existent (at least not documented), I'll ask you to indulge me when I bring up mixed race marriage aversion. In the US some of the objections to mixed-race marriages were biblically justified - there are passages that advise/command against marrying outside ones own tribe. So, given that Christians can, if they want to, use the same holy text to justify their position against mixed race marriage as they can against same sex marriage, what would your feelings/position be if the Bulls had offered two separate rooms to a black woman and a white man, on the basis that they do not view people of different colour as being ""properly married""?",0,1345037761,null,0,1345047407,0,c5thpok,t3_y97c4,t1_c5thpok,t1_c5thlui,null,1429644411,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

Hockey players deliberately hit it at each others feet to win fouls. Is this the same as hooking your leg round a defender and going down?

To go back to the olympics, is Tom Daley cheating when he asks for a second dive because he messed up his first when somebody took a photo? Was Bradley wiggins cheating by using a fancier bike? Is usain bolt cheating by not running hard in the heats (he would be in badminton apparently).

These are professional sportspeople. Like any professional, they try to maximise their efficiency whilst staying within the ruleset presented to then. The problem is with the people who set those rules, not those that test them.

If you don't want diving in football, you should complain about FIFA, not Ronaldo. If they introduced a new policy tomorrow of a one match ban for any player found to have benefited from simulation, it would stop immediately.

""No we are not discriminating against their sexuality. We would let gays stay, in a twin or two separate rooms. Just not in a double bed because it is against our religious beliefs.""

Alas; you don’t get to pick your own definition of what counts as discriminating behaviour. :P

&gt;With regard to your last paragraph: The couple in question were/are civil partnershipped. 

Well there you go then; no legs left to stand on.

Myself, I try to take a pragmatic view on things; if civil partnership are marriages in all but name then leave them as that; let the religious have their word and let the homosexual couples have their married benefits. Everyone’s happy. But then you get the idealists who love to fight these battles…

In general it’s a debate I have with my (religious) parents now and then; they see marriage as sacred, but my fellow siblings and I recognise that its been a long time since the sacredness of marriage has really meant anything to society, even if it still does to Christians.

Never dial a number starting 08 from a mobile. 08 numbers e.g. 08xxx xxxxxx are special rate numbers. Some (0800) are 'free' some (0845) are 'lo cost' some are premium popidol or dial-a-wank numbers. Perversely all 08 numbers cost money from a mobile.  Dial 0800 and 0845 from a landline.

Mobile phones are cheaper in the UK than the states (and Canada I assume).

You can go contract or Pay As You Go. PAYG is cheapest (prepay credit and shit phone) what it will do is let you have a number whilst you shop around for something better. It's easy to transfer numbers from one phone operator to another.

Of course I can see how it could lead to unrest however I believe that the freedom to choose who to do business with should trump that. However I accept that its a lot easier to say this now, when discrimination on any widespread basis is so rare, than it would have been 50 years ago.

&gt;Why, would you say, was legislation introduced to curb such activity?

Well, such legislation was introduced because people who hold the same view as me are in a small minority. Certainly while people might have more mixed views in this example the majority find the idea of a business discriminating on an obvious racist or homophobic basis too abhorrent to be legal. However although you can replace this case with an example that most people would find abhorrent, e.g. a hotel refusing to rent rooms to a mixed race couple, at the same time there are examples of discrimination that people would generally agree were fair e.g. hairdressers charging different rates for men and women (sexist discrimination), cinemas charging different rates for adults and children (ageist discrimination).

It appears to me that anti-discrimination law does not have a consistent, logical basis but rather is applied based on what the general public thinks is unacceptable. For example a restaurant with a sign in the door saying ""no blacks"" would be cracked down upon immediately but if a business was hiring and the interviewer believed that obesity was a sign of laziness and gave the job to one candidate at the expense of a more qualified overweight candidate its very unlikely that the business would be successfully sued for discrimination.

In 1992, the law was changed so that polytechnics could call themselves universities and they didn't have to get degree courses agreed with an outside body.

Point remains you attack a restart for embracing what you say is successful but not embracing which you clearly mark as unsuccessful; internet sales over highstreet.

It's a shame people can't understand the difference between explanation and justification.

I was playing with my sister's dogs, both bros across consecutive generations. I would scrag the youngest and pin it on the floor by its neck (nothing extreme). The more I put him in a submissive pose the more he play attacked the other dog, not me. Eventually he became too aggressive so I stopped doing that. I had some chickens as well that did a similar thing in times of stress, there was a pecking order and if one was unhappy it went down the line. It mirrored what I have seen in bullies and literature about soldiers, they feel abused by a greater 'authority' perhaps so they need to re-assert their position on the social hierarchy with greater ferocity.

On a macro level we see it all the time: activists and rioters perhaps. Many rioters talked about a subversion of the usual roles, they lost their fear of the police and became the dominant actors. They saw police backing off, getting injured, and all that latent hate came out. Of course that saw a greater 'violence' by the state regarding the harsher punishment and mass arrestes to reassert the traditional hierarchy.

That devalues any degree that isn't a First or from a really prestigious university, and you end up with plenty of people who've spent three years gaining a degree that doesn't have academic merit, won't help their career prospects, and has cost them thousands of pounds.

The reason people do that is because they're told, more by the schools and the government than anyone else, that everybody who's anybody needs to have a degree. That isn't true in alot of countries simply because by age 18 they've had a high-quality education that makes them employable.

If the schools leave people with an unimpressive resume them it's no surprise they seek tho polish it up a bit more with further qualifications, but that only extends the cycle of decline from schools to include universities. Not to mention it costs tax-payers and students themselves more money.

It isn't just secondary education though, literacy and numeracy at age 11 are in decline which means the problems start as early as primary school. Given that we've spend huge amounts of money on new technology, buildings, facilities etc over the last 15 years and not seen any benefit, the only conclusion I can come to is that it's an institutional problem - which seems to be supported by the fact that some state schools with comparable areas and resources do better than other state schools sharing those circumstances.

1. Alot more people got professional, high-paying jobs without a degree in those days. The fact that a degree was so rare meant it wasn't seen as a touchstone of employability.

2. The fundamental flaw of the '50s system was selection itself (though there are legitimate debates to be had about that) but the idea of a three-tier system based on *future employment*, with grammar schools educating future professionals, secondary moderns for skilled industrial workers and technical colleges for the unskilled. Deciding what kind of job someone will have when they are eleven, and then basing their education around that, is a disastrous idea.

3. If as you say, and I'd agree, we got by with a sizable number of poorly educated people in the past by merit of having plenty of unskilled jobs, which today we simply don't have, then the answer is surely to recalibrate our school system to take this into account, and to work harder to raise the standards attained. Other countries like Germany and Scandinavian nations have done this.

true,TragedyT,tardis,TARDIS,"I think seeing as they're (at least for the present) moving away from two-part episodes, that they really ought to very seriously consider giving the show a proper grown up running time.  

It is hard enough to tell a normal dramatic story set in the boring old real world in 42 minutes.  With our show *Jolly Old Mr Who*, you have the added difficulty of also having to introduce an entirely new set of characters, AND quite possibly a new world somewhere in time and space!  It's a wonder any of the stories make sense at all.

Mind you, I don't agree that Davies has ever made a cohesive evenly wonderful season - dropping hints to the season finale like VOTE SAXON doesn't really count as telling an ongoing story in my book.  The closest I'd agree he's come to a proper long story is the ongoing Cybermen stuff that went on in Season 2.  I happen to consider that to be his most successful period on the show, too.

And **every** season of Doctor Who has a mix of stinkers in amongst the gems.  It is one of the things the show is famous for, for better or worse.

Maybe I should have said I could have said the same when a 'former' worker, and a 'former worker' relative, appear on the same thread for a small company...but you get the gist.

&gt;You can have as many accounts as you want - to be honest that just makes it look even more suspect to be honest.

I only ever use one, the IP algorithm above anything else I assume sorts that one out. It's not suspect.  The matter of the comment is what matters.

&gt;You're absolutely correct about the comment I made about torching the stall though; that was a horrible comparison and for that I apologise.

it wasn't just a bad comparison, it showed you didn't know what limited liability meant.  You assumed it meant private insurance where it's a fundamental aspect of setting up a small to medium sized business.

&gt;As for ""exposing"" anything if you read the previous 2 threads from when this actually happened I've said that I worked there and other people made comments about how we felt as a whole about the company.

'Felt' means jackshit!  You felt that the company in administration wasn't paying their wages.  Being in administration meant that the company COULDN'T pay their wages.  The 'administration' is not part of the company.  Yet you put up a thread blaming them of exactly this.  The whole point of administration is that you bring someone else in from outside to manage affairs to see if the company is viable in any context.

&gt;All you've done really is get across your point in a rather crass way. 

You don't get to say that having posted this submission.  It's the definition of crass, uninformed and retaliatory.

&gt;If you stopped being a bit of a prat and just gave concise points it might have helped.

Concise.  Got it.

You don't understand:

- Revenue streams.

- Corporate administration.

If your talking about the general aggression in our society, then I would have to point out that we live in one of the least violent societies in the history of our species. And we do so during one of the least violent periods of history our planet has ever seen. Globally, armed conflicts are in decline, as are deaths caused by armed conflict. Even in areas such as Iraq or Afghanistan where we have seen sustained armed conflict the casualties figures for both combatants and non-combatants are far smaller than they were in WW2 or Vietnam. So I don't agree that things are getting more violent if you look at it from a global perspective and there is factual backing to this claim, [here](http://www.npr.org/2011/12/07/143285836/war-and-violence-on-the-decline-in-modern-times). 

If you want to look at it in terms of the UK and the last few years, then we've seen a small up-tick in aggression. But I think this can largely been explained by the economic crisis. We spent years in a massive boom period with good growth, a big rise in consumer spending and easy credit. People had jobs, they could afford to buy things &amp; go on holiday (and if they couldn't they could borrow the money for cheap), and they had lots of public services. But that's all pretty much gone now, and as a result people cannot live the same lives they used to. So people just want things to go back to how they were, and unfortunately no politician has had the balls required to tell them that it will never be as it was (our lifestyles were half the reason the crash happened), and it will take a fair bit of time for things to recover. So people aren't happy, they want things to ""go back to normal"" but it's not happening. And as a result we see more aggression. 

And I do think the riots supports this view, mainly because a large amount of the violence was looting of consumer goods, and very often the exact goods people would previously be able to get on credit without much work. The fighting with police was almost a sideshow to this. Where it did happen there might well have been an element of domination over a formerly strong foe, but I don't think it's indicative of anything wider in society.

There is no such thing as free money.

Not all of ""The Rich"" have auto-magically made gains on their losses. Some people have been able to see opportunities to make money in this economy, but why is this a bad thing? 

&gt; We know we could tax more...

Tax reform is complicated, it's not something that you can resolve in a few paragraphs. I would like to see more work done on this, but it isn't simple and if done with a heavy hand you are likely to cause more damage to the economy than good. But CGT has risen, which is a start.

&gt; ...we know corporations are tax havens...

That doesn't actually make any sense. Or do you mean they use tax havens?

&gt; We deliberately talk up the problem of benefit fraud, immigrants, and the disabled?

Benefit fraud isn't as big problem as the Mail would have you believe, but it does exist and reasonable steps should be taken to prevent it from taking place. 

Immigration is a complex issue again, and there is a lot to be said for the argument that large amounts of immigration without pressure to culturally integrate isn't a good thing. 

As for this war on the disabled, this is something that perplexes me. I see constant alarm about a war on the disabled, often with vauge statistics as this article shows.

In this economy with him insistent on joining only one team, with him having burned bridges beyond repair at the club, with him probably prepared to sulk like a bitch and drag us down with him, I believe we're doing the right thing by cutting our losses and moving on with our lives.

26m is at least 10m less than we deserve, but it's still enough to fund other moves and hopefully it's the catalyst for transfers to pick up.

It was an excellently executed episode with so many themes and emotions flashing before your eyes that you're not able to process them separately, but are able to see them all together as it shows how humanity tends to react to things. They become worried, scared, and insanely sacrificial and self-preserving.

One of the things to be said is that this episode does something with the Doctor that isn't often done. The Doctor doesn't save the day. He becomes overwhelmed by the situation and becomes a victim. During the heavy parts of the situation, he doesn't help out as much as usual, and just ends up riling up the other passengers to the point of hysteria.

In the end, when he meets up with Donna again, the usual episode ending of witty banter or daunting foresight isn't there. The witty comment is attempted, but is immediately shut down and the episode ends with the Doctor looking on, now newly worried about his own often overlooked mortality.

And that is why I like this episode

Dear Romelu,
 
With that attitude, I don't think you are going to get far. Allow me to rant: 

* You were barely 18 when you joined but built like a fucking tank. Unfortunately, that's about all you had going for you.
* You came into a team that played mostly sole-striker formations under both AVB &amp; RDM.
* Didier Drogba &amp; Torres were clearly ahead of you in the pecking order. Sturridge too, if I may say so.
* You didn't impress all that much in your Reserve outings. 
* For a striker touted as the next Drogba, you didn't impress much in your first real test playing against a 'truly PL' team - the Carling Cup match against Liverpool. Even though they played with quite a few second-stringers, you looked exhausted by the 60th minute.
* Since you had already played competitive games for BOTH Anderlecht &amp; Chelsea, it meant you couldn't be loaned out last season. The rules **explicitly** forbid it. 
* The huge swings of fortune during all of last season meant that we had to keep using our best XI almost all the time and you clearly were nowhere near our best XI. 

What I find irritating is your singularly immature handling of the media. You have been outspoken about your frustration more often than not. Chill buddy! Show some respect to the gaffer. 

Show some respect to us fans. 

Sure, you play for the Belgian national team at such a young age - good for you - but hey, Chelsea is NOT the Belgian national team. In fact, you are LUCKY to be playing for the Belgian national team and lucky that there aren't too many Belgian strikers who match up to your level. Unfortunately, you level is nowhere near that of Drogba or Torres, or even Sturridge. Go on, I dare you to deny that.

What? You scored 42 goals when playing in the Belgian leagues? Bravo. How come you didn't tear up the reserve-squad matches? How many did you score in your reserve outings? Oh, I see, you were 'forced' to play with 15-year old kids, is it? Tell me, how old is your brother, Jordan Lukaku? He was with you at Anderlecht too, right? What? The rest of the team wasn't playing up to your standards? Oh, if you were so good, why didn't we read any reports of you single-handedly winning matches for the reserves? How is it Lucas Piazon, Islam Feruz, Todd Kane, Goeorge Saville, Milan Lalkovic were mentioned time and again but you, the one-and-only ROMELU LUKAKU, barely got any mentions?

Because you didn't like the reserves. Sadly, you weren't good enough for the first-team - not even ahead of a massively out-of-form Torres and a suddenly-selfish Danny. And that's saying a lot.

You know what? Having watched the pre-season, I will say this: You still aren't good enough for the first team. I hope Steve Clarke drills some sense into you. I hope you comeback wiser, sharper, smarter - in all senses &amp; matters.

You just wanted to throw in ""Straw man points"" without having any idea what a straw man argument actually is. I see you've been spending some time on r/athesim.

A straw man argument is where you misrepresent the opponents point of view and then ""Burn"" the straw man, rather than the legitimate and more steadfast point of view of the opponent. It is the mark of somebody who is not clever enough to engage with the actual points proposed by the opponent.

In case you were wondering, here is a great example of a straw man argument:

""So, in your mind, it'd be ok if they allowed Irish and Blacks to stay as long as they didn't copulate under their roof?""

Tello is technically sound and tactically sound. He has wonderful technique, and being a Barca player, is naturally suited to the passing style that Rodgers employs. He might be just a little weak physically, but he is very, very fast. I would say he is a technically better version of Walcott, but he is only 18. 

It isn't wrong, however, to say that both Walcott and Johnson are much more experienced in the Premier League. The question, however, is whether we want to buy them or not. Both of them play for clubs that are in the Top 4 and are challenging for the title. They will not come cheap. Even Johnson, who is a fringe player, will not be sold for cheap. City are not idiots. They might be looking to offload him, but it will be for the right price. 

The Tello situation is currently on 2 possible scenarios. Either he comes on loan with an option to buy, or Barca sells him with a buyback clause. From what I hear, he doesn't want to leave Barca permanently because he has Barca DNA. Liverpool doesn't want to buy him permanently now, because as talented as he is, he is still not the finished article and very young. Barca prefers an outright sale with the buyback clause, since they are fairly sure that they will get him back if they want. They don't want the loan, because that will mean they have to negotiate a new contract with him, tying them down in the event that he doesn't turn out well. Liverpool prefers the loan option since we'll only be paying for his wages, and that isn't high. However, a purchase isn't out of the question, since he won't cost too much. The club just doesn't want to be bogged down by another promising youngster who doesn't end up making the cut. 

There are many, many sides to the whole transfer situation regarding Tello, Sahin, Dempsey and Adam. If Adam refuses to go on transfer (as rumoured), then Liverpool will have to pay cash outright for Dempsey. In this case, they will be more adamant on loaning Tello, not signing him. What the club seems to be doing now is to secure the Sahin loan, force Adam out to secure the Dempsey transfer, then negotiate either way on Tello. You can probably see how there are so many stakeholders involved that things can't move as fast we might want.",0,1345051662,null,0,false,0,c5tlc17,t3_y9joc,t1_c5tlc17,t3_y9joc,null,1429646185,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,not-really,null,null,"I don't think it is helpful thinking in terms of the visceral idea of violence anymore. A wider definition would include the mass prison population of America, destruction of habitat, agricultural land and rain forest. The Bhopal disaster. Two thousand people die and twenty-five thousand are seriously injured in the UK per year. Fifty thousand annual UK repossessions, each decade a quarter of a million die is the US from gun crime, there have been 31 CIA coups since WW2, and if I was being brave I would add the coercive effects of mass media and television. Let's not forget global warming.

If we look at the typical pattern of war, then perhaps it is better but what we have is state or statish entities turning against the civilian population. The threat of violence has not gone way. The world kinda collapsed into one corporate state, so that necessarily meant that symmetric warfare disappeared. Europe basically outsourced all of its environmental and social destruction to Taiwan, China and other places out of *sight**. Iraq is a bit strange some estimates say 1,000,000 have died indirectly (and we have yet to fully understand what depleted uranium will do). Famines are still a real usually political problem, and will get worse.

Compared to WW1 and WW2 then most things look insignificant, but look at the car, since then 70 million perhaps have been killed directly by the car world wide (it is around 6 million in the UK and that figure is quite precise). Violence for me has become remote or there was a decoupling of emotion. The important thing though is we are drifting back to that, the powers that be are making the same decisions that helped foment the greatest wars of all time, and what will the next one look like? Nothing as of yet is even being seriously contested, and we can see a fraying at the *seams**.

&gt; Massive boom period

This is just false for the majority. Ownership at the familial level of income, land, and time hasn't improved since the 70s. The people who really need to retrench or the logical ones like financial markets, corporations, and the richest amongst us but that isn't happening. Politicians need to speak to the rich, ie themselves. Meanwhile 15 billion got thrown at the Olympics, a few more billion is getting thrown at mass internet surveillance. It's the politicians (and you it seems) who are advocates of 'back to normality', back to the market and financial growth. Even the gutter dwelling rioters aren't swallowing the paradigm anymore.

&gt; [The Riots]

Looting for me wasn't the violence, it was something else. The real nasty stuff was aimed at the police, and this came first. The police fighting wasn't the side show, not by a long shot, it was the main event. Fear was lost during the fights, some people used that lack of fear to send a fuck you to the socio-economic system: ""it was a party atmosphere"". Career criminals then got involved.

Im saying that they can choose to, for a short while at least, not practice homosexual activity when staying at the Christian B and B.

My position is this:

I don't give too hoots what you are, just don't break the furniture or leave without paying.

However, I believe that as a small business owner, of a B and B, who was immediately open and up front about their Christian beliefs, SHOULD have the right to deny a shared bed to these gay men.

I think it is unpleasant of the owners, and not understanding, but I don't think it should be a crime. To turn the men away on account of their sexuality would be wrong, and justifiably illegal. However the men were not turned away, they were given easily fulfilled conditions.

I'm saying what they did was wrong, but should not be a criminal offence.

If you removed the cheating, you'd get far more (at least grudging) respect for opposition players. For instance, someone like Steven Gerrard should be a general role model, he came from a working class background to be one of the best players in the world, playing for his country, and staying with the same club throughout his career, and he has a tendency and history of scoring dramatic last minute winners. But he is incentivized to dive to win penalties, and so he does every now and again, and so he is ridiculed by opposition players, and loses his position of respect. I believe his nickname is 'starfish', for a particular sprawling style of falling. Or the same for Martin Keown and badgering referees.

You need to remove the incentive for these players to humiliate themselves in order to win.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'll think about finding something non-academic, but the best serious discussion of UK and European origins are by people like Mark Jobling ( Leicester Uni), and Mark Thomas (UCL).  Bryan Sykes is essentially a businessman and self publicist who runs  ""ancestry"" companies.

It is a mathematical fact that:

&gt;The vast majority of Europe (over 99%) is descended from just 7 women who lived around the time of the end of the last Ice Age. 

You could equally name 15 or 3 women.  It is just salemanship.

Genetic genealogy is really exciting at the moment - Neanderthal ancestors - but his stuff is just amateur hour.   

Here is the report of an interview with Rosalind Harding from Bill Bryson's ""notes from a small island"".  It gives a flavour of what serious people thought then, and she is pretty correct about what has been found since then (out of Africa is being modified a little)

&gt;At the time of our meeting, in early 2002, another Oxford scientist named Bryan Sykes had just produced a popular book called The Seven Daughters of Eve in which, using studies of mitochondrial DNA, he had claimed to be able to trace nearly all living Europeans back to a founding population of just seven women—the daughters of Eve of the title—who lived between 10,000 and 45,000 years ago in the time known to science as the Paleolithic. To each of these women Sykes had given a name—Ursula, Xenia, Jasmine, and so on—and even a detailed personal history. (“Ursula was her mother’s second child. The first had been taken by a leopard when he was only two. . . .”)
&gt;
&gt;    When I asked Harding about the book, she smiled broadly but carefully, as if not quite certain where to go with her answer. “Well, I suppose you must give him some credit for helping to popularize a difficult subject,” she said and paused thoughtfully. “And there remains the remote possibility that he’s right.” She laughed, then went on more intently: “Data from any single gene cannot really tell you anything so definitive. If you follow the mitochondrial DNA backwards, it will take you to a certain place—to an Ursula or Tara or whatever. But if you take any other bit of DNA, any gene at all, and traceit back, it will take you someplace else altogether.”
&gt;
&gt;    It was a little, I gathered, like following a road randomly out of London and finding that eventually it ends at John O’Groats, and concluding from this that anyone in London must therefore have come from the north of Scotland. They might have come from there, of course, but equally they could have arrived from any of hundreds of other places. In this sense, according to Harding, every gene is a different highway, and we have only barely begun to map the routes. “No single gene is ever going to tell you the whole story,” she said.

&gt;    So genetic studies aren’t to be trusted?
  
&gt;  “Oh you can trust the studies well enough, generally speaking. What you can’t trust are the sweeping conclusions that people often attach to them.”
  
&gt;  She thinks out-of-Africa is “probably 95 percent correct,” but adds: “I think both sides have done a bit of a disservice to science by insisting that it must be one thing or the other. Things are likely to turn out to be not so straightforward as either camp would have you believe. The evidence is clearly starting to suggest that there were multiple migrations and dispersals in different parts of the world going in all kinds of directions and generally mixing up the gene pool. That’s never going to be easy to sort out.”

Tax may be thought of the debt one owes society.

&gt; That doesn't actually make any sense. Or do you mean they use tax havens?

Is complicated but they are tax havens and use tax havens. The latter should be obvious, some companies don't exist beyond a name on a bank account or PO box.

Firstly there is no reason why the richest should be taxed at ~20% when the poorest of society have a tallied rate closer to 50% (VAT, income, council, that sort of thing). It gets worse when we think about the extra tax paid by graduates (I call it a tax because you can't bankrupt yourself out it).

Second though the way a company operates is such that transactions that would normally have VAT applied, don't when it happens under the umbrella of a company. The secretary working for the boss is trading VA services at 0% T. It is an odd way of looking at it I know, but that is happening. It is particularly the case when we think about heavily integrated companies: perhaps recruitment, writing, filming, postproduction, advertising, then distribution. Perhaps it would be much fairer if everyone was self employed, or better (I still don't like the idea of being a slave of sorts to oneself). They also avoid inheritance tax because they never die. The corporation only exists to hide wealth and identity. 

&gt; War on the disabled

It's not the language I would choose, but that is usually the language of the state, and if you only have a hammer as a solution then everything looks like a nail. Neither is it an area I know much about, but there is a clear narrative being written against benefits, which includes things like disabilities. People really do have this visceral hatred for the work shy shirkers, and that drifts across onto those with disabilities. ATOS seems to be the front line of the war. They've been given a largely arbitrary target and they are meeting it which seems a bit stupid, especially when it appears to be upping legal costs.

I listed those things because even though these people didn't cause the systemic failure those that control the narrative are having us hating the oppressed while still idolising that which oppresses them.",0,1345054249,null,0,false,0,c5tm3gp,t3_y8bco,t1_c5tm3gp,t1_c5tk23u,null,1429646539,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Codemos,lfc87,,"From a TTT member:

In theory Liverpool don’t need Sahin. Excluding Adam, the squad still have Lucas and Spearing; Allen and Henderson; Gerrard and Shelvey. If we conclude that the PL midfield trio would be Lucas-Allen-Gerrard, there isn’t single logical reason why Sahin would be happy to come here and sit on the bench waiting Gerrard to be injured or the odd Cups and EL games to come for him to have a playing time; more so when Arsenal are offering him almost guaranteed XI place (more so when Song leaves) and CL football.

But, digging deeper and suddenly there is a plausible variant that is coming to the surface. Adam and Spearing are moved out and Rodgers intends to play with 4-2-3-1 more often that with 4-1-2-3. Alongside this, given his high-pressing game he requires his players to be always fresh, so he needs four proper central midfielders (Lucas+Allen and Henderson+Sahin as a probable pairs) and two proper attacking midfielders (Gerrard and Shelvey) to rotate. Plus I’m sure as much Rodgers will prioritize PL he would like to go as far as possible in EL, if not in the domestic cups. 

Currently Lucas and Gerrard are having some fitness issues, albeit due to different reasons. Lucas has just come from a very serious injury and overplaying him would be pure madness. As for Gerrard – he is fastly becoming as injury-prone as Agger is. So as much the first choice trio would be Lucas-Allen-Gerrard as much two of these three players would need serious resting. For all I like Spearing and Adam, I’m objective enough to think that Sahin and Henderson would be much preferred by Rodgers, more so given that Sahin could come without transfer fee and with (probably) only partially paying his wages. And this would be massive upgrade on Spearing without paying any transfer fee. I recommend to see Dan Kennet’s stats comparison between Lucas, Allen and Sahin via Twitter to see that as much Sahin is creative as much he is defensive solid.

So, all in all, there is enough logical evidence to suggest that after more in-depth look at it Rodgers would be not only happy to have Sahin in his squad but also will have the room for him.

-

Well, Suarez has set up more goalscoring chances than actually converting last season. His link-up with Borini against Gomel shows that those two can be a fiery combination. 

Downing will prove to be a good player now that he doesn't have to constantly cross the ball to Carroll and he can prove his worth playing into Rodger's system by passing the ball directly instead of hoping it hits his target. 

Sahin and Gerrard will be constantly switching as Gerrard will fatigue more and takes longer to recover, while Sahin is young and can be that super sub or spark plug that Liverpool needs to tough matches. Both are great playmakers with an eye for goal.

Allen and Lucas are tough tackling, ball controlling, work horses who will provide some great link up between the defense and the offense. Allen will be probably be playing more of the movement of the ball from the defense to offense while Lucas dominates the battle between the midfield and defense.

And the defense won't really be questioned. I just hope that Coates, Robinson, Kelly, Wilson, and Flanagan get some games in. ",0,1345056293,null,0,false,0,c5tmpht,t3_y9t40,t1_c5tmpht,t3_y9t40,null,1429646832,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

So then we are just paying for a player to sit and devalue, we have things we need to get done and sending him out to reserves doesn't help accomplish that.

I agree that the price is far too low, but our market for Luka given our valuation isn't great. Currently we have a player who doesn't want to play for us and who's antics are wearing on coach, club, potentially teammates and fans.  

Given out pricing that gives us who that we can sell to that can afford to buy:

Chelsea - Just spent on Oscar and we don't want to sell to them

Man United - We don't want to sell to them and they also lowballed the price

Man City - We don't want to sell to them and they don't have a major need for him

PSG - Just dropped 40m on Lucas

Barca - little to no interest shown

Malaga - Money woes takes them out of the picture

Inter - No interest shown

AC Milan - No interest shown

Juve - No interest shown

Real - Interested but also don't have a major NEED for him.

So that means our market is 1 team....if he sits on the reserves that 1 team isn't going to suddenly pay more for him, more teams may become interested but will also be offering less money.

Unfortunately it seems (and all of this in the press may be speculation) like the best move for all sides is to try and get something resembling a fair market value and move on.

I would prefer he stays, barring that i would prefer Anzil or one of the Russian teams thinks that they can win it all if they have Luka so the price is driven up.

You say you're being capped. Virgin only reduces speed if you exceed the limit for your tier, which can be upload or download. I can't remember the exact time but if I download over 3GB during the day (10:00-15:00 or 16-20 I think) then they reduce my speed by 75%.

The best thing to do is to schedule large downloads for off-peak hours, that includes things like streaming video etc. It does seem strange that you're getting limited to 2mbs since there is no 8mb tier. If you're on 10MB you should be getting 2.5MB even when capped. It suggests that you may have a technical issue, so perhaps you might want to pick a day to avoid using your connection much and speed test at various times, if there's still a problem then ringing them might be a good idea.

While I have been very happy with Virgin I'm also happy that BT Infinity is now rolling out.

I think it's fair to say that this entire issue is all about sex. Something that should be pointed out is that, save illegal or disturbing activities, it is absolutely none of the Bulls' business what goes on in one of their rooms when it has been hired. I think that's actually the law? They essentially turned the gay couple away to stop them from doing anything sexual under their roof, which wasn't a dead cert in the first place.

&gt;  who was immediately open and up front about their Christian beliefs

They weren't though, unless you mean specifically when the gay couple turned up. But as I've mentioned a couple of times earlier, they only were up front about these strongly held convictions about non-married copulation when the gays arrived.

&gt;  However the men were not turned away

They were actually, given that the place was full, even ignoring that they'd booked ahead of time.

&gt; let the religious have their word

There is a minor problem with this notion: It's not their word! Opinion is divided on whether or not the word or institution did ever belong to religion, and no-one can dispute that unions of different kinds (including same sex, oddly enough) have been around for millennia. Certainly it does not belong to any one religion currently operating in the world today, and most definately not in the UK now. Even if it did, it's been adopted by society in general and the majority of marriages have no religious element at al. [Over 2/3 of marriages in England &amp; Wales are now secular in nature - non-religious](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/marriages-in-england-and-wales--provisional-/2010/marriages-in-england-and-wales--2010.html#tab-Type-of-ceremony) - and that number is growing year on year. Secular marriages have outnumbered religious unions for 20 years now.

It's true that religion used to hold sway over marriages, [however in 1836 (176 years in 2 days time, in fact) the Marriage Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836) was passed that freed marriages from *having* to be performed by a CoE minister in a CoE church (excluding Jews &amp; Quakers). Other religions (i.e. Catholic) could have their own religious service, but in order for the marriage to be legal and recognised by the state, the couple had to have a CoE service too. In 1836 the law finally allowed for minority religions to have legally recognised marriages (if performed by a licensed individual) and also allowed no religious ceremonies to take place in registry offices. As you can probably imagine, this was resisted by some Lords/Bishops (see the Bishop of Exeter's thoughts on the matter in the previous link) on the basis that it was detrimental to the sanctity of marriage.

But, and this is a very important point to make: For the non-religious, the sanctity of a specific religion is unimportant, or irrelevant. I should point out that that does not mean people should be allowed to go and 'desecrate' a church or similar, rather it means that, for example, the non-religious can't (or shouldn't) be slapped for taking ""the Lord's name in vain"". Jesus don't mean squat to me, so thanks but no thanks: my marriage isn't going to be under his watchful gaze. Why should it?

So: No, marriage is not the property or invention of one particular religious group and so there is no argument that they can be left alone to have it.

&gt; Everyone's happy.

As you might have guessed from the above: not so in your scenario! Sure, it could be that a large fraction of gay couples won't want to get married as they might see the institution as having baggage, religious or otherwise. But that is no reason to deny them the choice. If one couple is being treated unfairly, then that is too many.

&gt; But then you get the idealists who love to fight these battles…

A little dismissive, guv, if I may say so. There's more to it than trying to piss off some Christians! I don't think I'm an idealist anyway... you might disagree. Let me know.

&gt; they see marriage as being sacred

Similar to above: Non-religious people don't see it as sacred, at least not specifically religiously sacred (the term can *just about* be applied secularly). But for people like your parents - good for them, that's fine! They can have a sacred marriage. But, as I'm sure you probably agree(?), that doesn't mean they can dictate how others view or take up a marriage.

Incidentally, why is it do you think, that religious people aren't protesting about the number of non-religious ceremonies that take place every year? As I pointed out, for decades now most people don't go to church to get married. Add to that the number of divorces, isn't that a massive kick in the teeth for the sanctity of marriage? Yet I've never heard a peep about it from a group like Christian Concern etc. Never once. I suppose they're content that it's heteros getting married?

Out of interest (without sounding accusatory, I assure you I'm not being so), where do you stand on the issue and why? I can't tell, from your comments, and I'd be interested to know.

Only the ultra-rich and super poor can afford university now. The poor get it free, and it's peanuts to the rich. The middle classes once again feel the pinch. Earning too much to qualify for assistance, but not wealthy enough to cover expenses.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; I don't think it is helpful thinking in terms of the visceral idea of violence anymore. A wider definition would include the mass prison population of America, destruction of habitat, agricultural land and rain forest. The Bhopal disaster. Two thousand people die and twenty-five thousand are seriously injured in the UK per year. Fifty thousand annual UK repossessions, each decade a quarter of a million die is the US from gun crime, there have been 31 CIA coups since WW2, and if I was being brave I would add the coercive effects of mass media and television. Let's not forget global warming.

If you make up your own definitions for things it's far more easy to make a point I suppose. However I do think it's best if we actually stick to what violence actually is defined as traditionally, namely ""behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something"". This is a rather vauge list of things you don't like, and in some cases isn't clear at all. You say ""two thousand people die and twenty-five thousand are seriously injured in the UK per year"" but fail to mention the cause of this. Are we talking about traffic accidents or smoking? And how is television violence? 

&gt; Compared to WW1 and WW2 then most things look insignificant, but look at the car, since then 70 million perhaps have been killed directly by the car world wide (it is around 6 million in the UK and that figure is quite precise). Violence for me has become remote or there was a decoupling of emotion. The important thing though is we are drifting back to that, the powers that be are making the same decisions that helped foment the greatest wars of all time, and what will the next one look like? Nothing as of yet is even being seriously contested, and we can see a fraying at the seems.

The definition you use for ""violence"" doesn't actually mean anything because it's personal one that only you share. So in the context of a debate regarding society becoming more violent it's irrelevant. But I could look at it in a different way, and say that since you live in a society which is largely free from violence as a part of daily life, you struggle with defining it and thus violence becomes a rather vague and nebulous concept. 

When it comes to ""the powers that"" be fomenting violence on a national scale, I do not agree. We have 2 rather powerful mechanisms which act against great powers going to war today. Firstly, the threat of nukes. Any direct conflict between two powers with nuclear weapons is largely unthinkable today, because if they do fight and it looks like one might best the other then it is almost certain that non-conventional weapons will be used. So there is the ever present threat that even if you can invade another nation and beat their military, that they will kill millions of your people in a matter of hours. So no great powers want to go to war.

Secondly, the globalized trade system is a very strong deterrent in itself. The more countries are reliant on many other countries for goods the less likely it is they will want war. And the more likely it is they will want to solve disputes via diplomacy. And on a lower level, the more reliant a nation is on external trade, the more likely it is that their population will have a far better understanding of other populations. This makes it less likely that populist nationalism will work as it did in the early 20th century. 

&gt; This is just false for the majority. Ownership at the familial level of income, land, and time hasn't improved since the 70s. The people who really need to retrench or the logical ones like financial markets, corporations, and the richest amongst us but that isn't happening. Politicians need to speak to the rich, ie themselves. Meanwhile 15 billion got thrown at the Olympics, a few more billion is getting thrown at mass internet surveillance. It's the politicians (and you it seems) who are advocates of 'back to normality', back to the market and financial growth. Even the gutter dwelling rioters aren't swallowing the paradigm anymore.

This is why credit was so important to people, and why the lack of it now is such an issue. Credit allowed people to feel richer, and combined with lower prices for big ticket items allowed people to own more stuff. You cannot deny there was a boom in terms of consumer spending and people feeling richer. 

As for me peddling the "" back to normality"" line, I resent that. My entire argument for some time is that the ""normality"" of the '97 to '07 years is never coming back, and that politicians need to have the balls to tell people it isn't coming back. The entire debt driven consumerism concept of the last decade is over and people will need to become used to a low growth economy.


&gt; Looting for me wasn't this context isn't the violence, it was something else. The real nasty stuff was aimed at the police, and this came first. The police fighting wasn't the side show, not by a long shot, it was the main event. Fear was lost during the fights, some people used that lack of fear to send a fuck you to the socio-economic system: ""it was a party atmosphere"". Career criminals then got involved. My overall point is that we would be foolish to ignore these subtle tells, or forget what history has told us.

It might have been the main event at the outset, but it was rapidly outstripped by looting and theft. And this is what highlights the reason for the growing discord in our society, that it is still dominated by consumerism and hasn't get caught up with the reality that this is over.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"Curiously, are you moving into a new place with OTHER students?

If so your three main ISP concerns will be;

* Contract length
* Speed
* Bandwidth and throttling

Then there is technology to choose from;

* ADSL (1-8mbit) *(requires phone line rental)*
* ADSL2 LLU (1-24mbit) *(O2/Sky) (requires phone line rental)*
* VDSL Fibre (1-300mbit) *(BT/Sky) (requires phone line rental)*
* DOCSIS 3 Cable (1-1000mbit) *(VM/Others depending on area) (can be used standalone)*

Your cheapest provider without silly caps will be found on ADSL2 LLU I would imagine (likely O2). But the distance from the exchange may well affect your speed a great deal.

If you are sharing with others, anything under 10mbit you are going to notice. So that strikes out ADSL standard.

If no one is a heavy downloader, any ADSL2 LLU+ may serve your needs.

But don't discount Virgin. Although their customer service varies and their price is higher, they are generally quite reliable. Speeds should not fluctuate under 20mbit often, even in a student area. VM do not use download caps, but they will throttle your connection during certain hours. Generally not a concern.

Your contract length is another factor. If you are in a place for 9 months like many students, you will not want a 12 month contract!

Finally, how many you are sharing with does matter, as does your local street. It is no good for example, getting a 100mbit Virgin connection... but using a 2.4GHz wifi router as your neighbours signals will ensure no one in your house can reach that speed. Although I think the 100mbit VM Superhub does 5GHz fine. Always better to use a CAT5/6 cable for anyone that does slightly more than use facebook :).

If you are sharing with a Skype-video user, gamer, IT/CompSci person, or someone quite IT literate... you are probably going to want a fancy router which does Quality of Service too, before they use all your bandwidth with usenet/torrents. This is especially true if you opt for something under 10mbit.",0,1345064197,null,0,1345064869,0,c5tp5fq,t3_y997m,t1_c5tp5fq,t3_y997m,null,1429647978,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On 1 hand I think, lets say Man United are making a million quid a game why shouldn't Rooney, for example, demand the 200 grand of that or whatever he makes, as people pay to see him and it is him and his team mates who bring the money in. On the other hand I can't help but think that no one needs that amount of money and the demanding of it is part of the shit heap that football is now in.

Anyway, tangent over. This article, jesus it just makes me angry. ""we don't need that hatred and abuse which footballers have to suffer,"" are you kidding me?. My dad was in the police, I'm fairly sure he received more ""hatred and abuse"" than any footballer will ever get and was paid fuck all in comparison.


""Certainly we didn't see too much of that in the Olympic Games."" Yea you know why Roy, because the Olympics attracts people who want go watch sport somewhere where they aren't worried that every 5 minutes there will be a chant along the lines of ""the referee is a wanker"" when they have 2 kids with them. Want to know why people think this is acceptable? Because they see players say this and worse on the pitch.

Finally ""Hodgson says players and spectators should emulate the spirit of London 2012"". Never gonna happen. The shit that both footballers and supporters get away with has gone on for too long for there to be a change without giving the sport a makeover across the world.  
Can you imagine if our referees started wearing headsets, and everytime a player was heard making a derogatory comment they were fined 10% of their wage, players would not want to play in this country because my god you can't walk up to a referee and call him a fucking retard anymore.

I think it's a massive shame how much emphasis is put on football in this country rather than sports that actually have role models to look up to. If I had a kid who had a choice between well any footballer or Usain Bolt, or Chris Hoy, or Steve Redgrave, or Rafael Nadal it's a pretty easy choice.",0,1345065227,null,0,false,0,c5tpgaq,t3_y865a,t1_c5tpgaq,t3_y865a,null,1429648120,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It wasn't the people that caused WW1 and WW2 it was the aristocracy as if it was a global game of risk, where only the poor lost their lives as plutocrats largely threw serfs from a safe distance over the top in a pursuit of vanity. This doesn't really get talked about in schools, it's mostly fluffy poetry, solemn head bowing and how people fought the noble fight. (This is relevant even as recently as the Falkland wars, and today's proxy conflict via the media.) That's a complete disney-fication and later only some will find out that Britain was doing some very shady things and the US effectively bombed their own people (later we learn they did bomb their own people!). We also find out that democracy and the free market is a sham, having been 'birthed' by various CIA backed coups that happen to this day in Libya and Syria.

The current trend in America is truly horrific. Just the other day there was an elected GOP official espousing the virtues of killing homosexuals, I'll paraphrase: 'I'm not saying we should kill the gays, but the bible makes it clear'. They are already applying the NDAA with activists being disappeared in some cases, and if you saw the response to the Anaheim unrest (cop shot a man like Daggan) it looks like the military descended on sections of the latino population. There was footage of 'less than lethal' rounds being fired at journalists cowering with press cards held aloft. They are already arresting people around the world at gunpoint for trumped up intellectual crimes, dropping bombs on their own civilians, murdering once friendly dictators, and they main event that made it all possible looks ridiculously suspect. If 9/11 was a legitimate attack by a foreign entity then [it might be the exception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag). Things get really dark when we read about Operation Northwoods (1962):

&gt; [Operation Northwoods proposals included hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government. It stated:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods)

&gt; [*""The desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.""*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods)

What does that sound like? 9/11? 7/7? Madrid? The phony evidence for entering Iraq? What else do we know? The most dangerous man according to Interpol, wasn't Assad, it wasn't even Gaddafi. It was Julian Assange, the only one on a red notice which is the most severe class of threat. The news is sporadic right now but Wikileaks are claiming that the UK authorities are threatening to assault the embassy:

&gt; [We reviewed the ""Diplomatic and Consular Premisis Act 1987"" that the UK is claiming gives them the right to storm embassy. No such right.](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/235851759019495424)

I have got a little side tracked because that last tweet happened about 15 minutes ago: the secret services and powers that be are ultra, ultra paranoid. Why?

Anyway the point is the mentality of the plutocrats hasn't changed. They still think they can do whatever it takes to get whatever they want. This is being played out in the papers as they agitate ill-feeling towards those on benefits and censor (or ignore) the Trapwire story. More worrisome are the proposed military schools, secret courts, total surveillance technology, and of course systemic financial (and war) crime that goes unpunished.

**Edit**: The law cited in the foreign office letter, the [Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46), does have provisions for the secretary of state to withdraw consent of the land to be used as diplomatic or consular land if

In that regard, it would be terrible for RvP to fire Chelsea above Arsenal but more acceptable for him to see United triumph over City. Also, I doubt we would be stumping up £24m and £200k a week for a 29 year old, for the same overall outlay we could bring in a younger striker. 

United's total outlay on RvP will probably be around £65m over 4 years, if Cavani cost £40m and was given £130k a week he would amount to roughly £70m over the same period but would also have a significant resale value.

Step out the door, and go north towards town and you'll quickly be in an area dominated by University of Edinburgh students. So quite a few cheapish food places and niceish bars, but more student-oriented and a bit hit &amp; miss. Consider a pint in [Leslie's Bar](http://www.lesliesbar.com/) or [Old Bell Inn](http://www.oldbelledinburgh.co.uk/).

I'd suggest walking up Arthur's Seat. It's the done thing, and a nice view.

Otherwise though, head towards the centre. Maybe 10 min walk from your guesthouse you will be near the Museum of Scotland. It's not really world-class, but it's free and worth an hour or two.

Out of there, wave at Greyfriar's Bobby and a couple of minutes north you'll hit the Royal Mile (officially named High Street). This is pretty much the main tourist destination, if mainly for the castle at the top. It's a bit overpriced and aside from the view I'm not sure there's that much to see. Some nice pubs and okay eating around if you pick well. I quite like the Castle Arms pub (if it's sunny, go out the back door). Alternatively you can go down to Grassmarket from here (at night time this is the main ""getting very drunk"" area, but it can be nice during the day).

Around this area do one of the dungeons/marys close/etc tours. There's also some other little things around, I seem to remember a little gallery down one of the closes which was pretty cool just to see the building. 

North again and into the centre, options get a bit wider here but I'll suggest, lets see.. I always find this kinda hard because it's not like London or Berlin or whatever where there's numerous obvious must sees.  A lot of good food and bars are hidden away (or maybe I think they're nice because they're not touristy...). Maybe go up Carlton Hill during the day if the weather's nice.

true,InfernoZeus,lfc68,,"I feel like this comes up every 20 minutes..

Currently, our midfield looks like this:
&gt; Gerrard, Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Shelvey, Adam, Spearing, Suso

According to most accounts, Adam won't be with us much longer, and I think we all agree that Spearing isn't really at the level required by Liverpool. This leaves us with the following:
&gt; Gerrard, Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Shelvey, ~~Adam~~, ~~Spearing~~, Suso

Suso isn't ready for the first team in the Premier League, and needs to go out on loan. Shelvey has really impressed during the preseason, and seems to be in Rodger's team plans, but his touch still lets him down occasionally, usually leading to a rash challenge. He'll probably play in Europa League and Cup games, but won't be competing for the first team week-in, week-out. That leaves us with the following potential first team midfielders:
&gt; Gerrard, Lucas, Allen, Henderson, ~~Shelvey~~, ~~Adam~~, ~~Spearing~~, ~~Suso~~

As much as we don't like to admit it, Gerrard is getting older, and playing 60 games in a season is an impressive feat, regardless of the age. For a 32 year old, it's even more impressive. He'll need to be rested every so often, as will the other three. 

Imagine if one of them picked up a long term injury? Do you really want to be stuck with the same midfield three for a long period? Should we fall back on one of youth players, perhaps putting them into high pressure games before they're ready for it?

Personally, I'd much rather have the extra cover of Sahin, (although he'll likely be in the first team more often than not). It also gives extra incentive to the players if they feel like they need to fight to keep their position. Lots of people gave Henderson a tough time last year, and while I think he did fine, if there had been someone waiting on the touchline to replace him, I bet he might have been that little bit more willing to fight for it.",0,1345069009,null,0,false,0,c5tqii6,t3_ya9x5,t1_c5tqii6,t3_ya9x5,null,1429648629,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Frank Lampard is Super Frank (scored 220 goals as a midfielder!!), Terry is called England's Brave John Terry or EBJT on forums like this--started out as scorn but we adopted it, David Luiz is Sideshow Bob because he looks like him, Essien is the Bison because he is unstoppable (or at least was in his prime), Ramires was been known as the Blue Kenyan when he was at Benfica for his ability to keep running,  Danny Sturridge is often just called Studge. Can't think of any more.

As for Anderlecht and the Jupiler league - it is mostly a runaway league for them. They've won the league for the last three years consecutively. Lukaku has been the top-scorer only once in his four years at Anderlecht - and even then he had scored only 15 goals. What does that say about his prolific goal-scoring ability? Oh, and guess what?

You might be thinking I am playing a game here with semantics, but I'm not really and even if I am this is a game long played: violence vs colateral damage. If I was going to implement a bus system and knew there would be a failure rate like the car I would be criminally negligent. However, the modern economy is such that these deaths are perfectly acceptable and accepted. No one starts a nasty Dailymail hit piece for the greatest serial killer in Britain, yet benefit claimants and the like are cast as fair game for abuse. They are a threat to your comfortable TV watching, cheap beer, holiday in the *Costa Del Sumwharo*, and relatively cushy pension. Mountains were moved for the low threat that is terrorism. Have you seen one? In fact I might be one for all I know having donated to Wikileaks in the early days when you could do so by card.

The point is we could put everybody in solitary confinement (in a way we have done but that is a longer debate for some other time) and say look aren't we peaceful! No one even gets punched, there are now wars, this is progress. A reduction using the traditional notion of interspecies violence as a measurement isn't helpful, and it certainly doesn't prove we can't go backwards nor that we can't do substantially better. Or how peace in Europe is aided by conflict in Africa. 

&gt; Globalised trade

Ask Greece how that worked out. There is a case to be made for the global democratic system having come about because having an entire nation tied to a regally derived debt was less risky than a capricious monarch. We've created a system of various people holding various financial guns to various heads of other states. You better pay your debts and not elect left leaning governments. You better do as the IMF tells you. The system we have is so insistent on violence and war it had to fabricate them against drugs, terrorism and states who couldn't fight back.

&gt; the ""normality"" of the '97 to '07 years is never coming back

I don't see anything special about those years. The socio-economic structure hasn't changed much in 200 years, those at the top just couldn't get away with violence because of the ease at which data became transmissible. The system we have is so insistent on violence and war it had to fabricate them against drugs and terrorism.

True, but you don't start paying it UNTIL you're earning. And if you drop below the earnings threshold you stop paying for it.

&gt;Why don't you try living without that 'small £50' a week then?
Where did you get the £50/week figure from.

http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/DG_10034866

The actual data show the following salary plus the rate of repayment:

under £21,000 	 no repayments

 £25,000 = £30/month

 £30,000 = £67.50/month

 £40,000 = £142.50/month

 £50,000 = £217.50/month

 £60,000 = £292.50/month

Si with your example of £50/week, that person would be earning between £50-60k/yr. I don't think they'd have any problem paying back £50 a week.

Besides, that's not really the point. University isn't free. SOMEBODY is paying for it. Now this system is more fair than before. If you want to go, you pay for it. And you get a very generous loan with tiny repayments to help you. If you really think the repayments are crippling, you should also be pushing the government to lower our taxes, since an average earner of £24k/yr has £100/week removed from their wages before they even get them.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; You might be thinking I am playing a game here with semantics, but I'm not really and even if I am this is a game long played: violence vs colateral damage. If I was going to implement a bus system and knew there would be a failure rate like the car I would be criminally negligent. However, the modern economy is such that these deaths are perfectly acceptable and accepted. 

I'm lost here. Cars are dangerous things, and so are buses. Both have killed many people due to accidents since their invention. However the trade off is that they are very useful. Cars have revolutionized our way of living in both good and bad ways. And before cars existed, people were being knocked down and killed by trains, trams, trolleybuses, hansom cabs, stagecoaches, wagons, chariots, and people on horse back, so its nothing to do with ""modern economy"" being fine with collateral damage, and everything to do with life being a series of trade-offs and risk benefit analyses. Is your argument that cars are bad things, and that the cons vastly out weigh the pros? 

&gt; No one starts a nasty Dailymail hit piece for the greatest serial killer in Britain, yet benefit claimants and the like are cast as fair game for abuse. They are a threat to your comfortable TV watching, cheap beer, holiday in the Costa Del Sumwharo, and relatively cushy pension. Mountains were moved for the low threat that is terrorism. Have you seen one? In fact I might be one for all I know having donated to Wikileaks in the early days when you could do so by card.

People often talk about the dangers of cars, which is why our roads are safer than they have ever been before. 

As for terrorism, it is a threat. Or are you ignoring the over 3500 people who died as a result of terrorism in the UK since the end of WW2? The modern islamic terrorism is overplayed by the media, but as the 7/7 bombings proved it is a real threat.

&gt; Ask Greece how that worked out. There is a case to be made for the global democratic system having come about because having an entire nation tied to a regally derived debt was less risky than a capricious monarch. We've created a system of various people holding various financial guns to various heads of other states. You better pay your debts and not elect left leaning governments. You better do as the IMF tells you. The system we have is so insistent on violence and war it had to fabricate them against drugs, terrorism and states who couldn't fight back.

Greece mis-managed it's economy and used Goldman Sachs to hide it's true borrowing figures in order to facilitate joining the Euro. Had it not done so it would be able to resolve it's current problems with relative ease. The reason other nations have a say in the internal operations of the Greek state is because it is reliant on foreign money to survive, without German money the nation would have defaulted on it's loans long ago. 

&gt; I don't see anything special about those years. The socio-economic structure hasn't changed much in 200 years, those at the top just couldn't get away with violence because of the ease at which data became transmissible. The system we have is so insistent on violence and war it had to fabricate them against drugs and terrorism.

Interesting that you neglect to add context to your claims that Assange acknowledges rape, when the lawyer explicitly states that ""As in the case of the first incident, Emmerson argues that subsequent consent renders the entire encounter consensual, and legal."" - Because that's never happened before between a man and a woman. 

To pretend that men and women never exist in a sexual dynamic in foreplay of dominance is just utterly ridiculous, and has nothing to do with rape. Furthermore, it's an insult to real victims of rape to frame this incident as such, and you're a revoltingly selective little pedant to try and frame it this way. 

**Funny how one of the alleged victims was writing on twitter about what a great, amazing guy Assange was after the alleged ""rape"" at a barbeque they both attended the day after.**

I applied to Durham Uni Computer Science first and York Uni Computer Science second.

I then got an E in History (total fuck up on my part *and* my schools part, awful teaching) and basically thought fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

I wrung up Durham. Now in Durham its a bit different, you apply to a college (or an open application where they just assign you a College). I wrung up, and was told ""Sorry, you didn't get in"".

Fuck.

I wrung up York. I was then told, ""Sorry you didnt get in"".

Fuck fuck.

Now, I had 3 grades, A in  Maths, A in Further and E in History, I was pretty furious because I knew that History mark meant nothing to a mathematical based course. But anyway, no uni places.

I was about to call up clearing, putting it off because I was not in the mood, but panicing knowing places might go before I call, when the phone wrung.

It was Durham Uni, but a different college, saying ""We have a spare place if you want it?"". I was so relieved, so happy I just said yes straight away and that was that.

The course, in the end, turned out to be pretty shit.

I realise now, I have no idea what the moral or point of this story was.

Maybe my E in History was pretty justified, I was always crap at essays.

EDIT - To anyone confussed, I did the same course I applied to, colleges in Durham are just like halls of residence. Once refused me but another had a spare place in the end. Me saying the course was a bit crap was with regards to the teaching...I'm now a software developer (games) so I'm in the field my degree set me up for.

true,Crimsoneer,eu,London," I've studied policing and investigating rape extensively.  The methodology for how you investigate and prosecute rape has change completely over the last twenty or so years, for the better.  How?  By saying that, no matter how sceptical you are, you always arrest somebody, and you always investigate.  Why?  Because, if you don't, your prejudice gets in the way of a good investigation.  When the wife  that came to the police station sobbing the night before reporting rape, and comes back 2 days later to say she made it all up to spite her husband, you don't drop it all and go home.  When a girlfriend who spent all night drinking at her boyfriends house comes in the morning saying she was raped, you still investigate, no matter what it looks like.  When a rape report sounds like it was completely made up, you still arrest somebody and investigate.

You never, ever tell the rape victim that she's lying - that leads to a hell of a lot of slut-shaming, chauvanistic bullshit behaviour, and rapists walking free.  Which is exactly what you're suggesting.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"I can envision a couple different line-ups although I suspect Sahin just adds to Lucas and Allen as options for the two deeper spots in the three-man midfield.  Having three good players for two spots isn't really a problem.  We have a lot of games to play and there are always injuries to deal with on top of general fatigue and form.  It's also a good position to make subs into so players are still getting time.

**Option 1:  4-3-3**

Basically what we've been expecting since Allen signed and Sahin, Allen and Lucas are just fighting for two spots.  Sahin is a more natural replacement for Allen but Swansea played with Britton and Allen as their holders so it's not like Rodgers demands a pure defensive midfielder if Lucas needs a break.  Sahin and Allen could easily be a holding midfield partnership behind Gerrard in that scenario.

--------------Reina--------------

--------Skrtel-----Agger--------

Johnson-----------------Enrique

-------------Lucas---------------

------------------Sahin/Allen----

---------Gerrard-----------------

--Downing--------------Borini--

--------------Suarez-------------


**Option 2:  4-4-2 (or 4-1-2-1-2)**

A slightly more defensive option that narrows the field.  The midfield four can tilt to become a box with Gerrard more on the right and Sahin left at the top of the Box or Allen and Sahin and drop deeper into a 4-3-1-2, depending on how the game is going.

--------------Reina--------------

--------Skrtel-----Agger--------

Johnson-----------------Enrique

-------------Lucas---------------

------Allen----------Sahin------

------------Gerrard-------------

-----Suarez-----------Borini----

**Option 3:  4-3-3**

Lucas, Allen and Sahin play as midfielders and Gerrard pushes high up as the right wing-forward.  Suarez, Borini and Gerrard all interchange at will.  Allen and Sahin hold possession while looking to send through-balls as the front three work off each other to make perpendicular runs along the opponent's defensive line.  Awesomeness ensues.

--------------Reina--------------

--------Skrtel-----Agger--------

Johnson-----------------Enrique

-------------Lucas---------------

------Allen---------Sahin-------

--Gerrard----------------Borini--

--------------Suarez-------------

**Option 4:  Italian 3-5-2**

If you want to get really creative you can play with three at the back and make Lucas an AMAZING libero and have Johnson and Enrique play as true wing-backs.  Sahin, Allen and Stevie control the middle of the field and Suarez and Borini play up top.

Three average men's working lives.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but I'm saying that it's a bit naive to think that that's a normal university experience.

It was trivial even at 3500 deaths, it was just spectacular, straight out of Hollywood. You are going to hate me but [Operation Northwoods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods). It needed to be as extreme as what followed.

The state is the major threat to the civilian population, it always has been and still is, but like always people are too preoccupied with artificial infighting to see the obvious patterns. Whether 9/11 was a false flag it doesn't matter, because it was undeniable wounds of a self inflicted nature brought about by a terrible foreign policy. The funny thing is not once has the anti-terror forces cracked open the global conspiracy. All the 7/7 were UK civilian nobodies, 'cleanskins' they were called. But yeah, Al Qaeda! The same groups that receive money to kill Libyans and Syrians today.

I suspect more people have slipped and died on wet floors over the same period. You humans have a terrible threat model.

Although I tend to think that the writers at the time didn't think that the show would last long enough to worry about 13 actors playing the role  it would be nice to think that maybe though someone was being creative and looked at the face of a traditional clock and though hmm 12...

As for the possibility of another Time Lord hiding or coming in from a parallel universe that well may be a future story. Personally I'm looking forward to the 12th incarnation of the Doctor as he is supposed to be somewhat evil - again this is according to the classic series - and this may be one of the reasons the silence will fall once an evil minded Doctor is released on the universe

Oh dear, Alex Jones fan I take it?

&gt; I suspect more people have slipped and died on wet floors over the same period. You humans have a terrible threat model.

Irrelevant. In a society with low violence levels like ours, 3500+ violent deaths due to terrorism is substantial. 

&gt; If 25k are seriously injured in a car accident every year and the average life expectancy is 70 years that means at any one time we have a around 1.75 million people walking around whose lives have been seriously affected. That's a hell of a drain on the economy and a hight human cost.

We wouldn't have an economy that was remotely comparable to ours without the car. It has brought trillions in economic value. And I still don't really get your point with cars.

&gt; For about 200 years there has been famine after war after financial crash, in that sense nothing has changed. Perhaps all that has changed is the UK population is more docile and the violence is occluded. 

Again, read actual history. Study things like social housing or the Poor Laws.

With a B&amp;B you are letting somebody stay in property which you own. Shouldn't you be able to choose who you want to stay there?

This story has gained traction because the UK generally supports gay rights. And I can't abide religious people, but let's be honest about something - if the couple trying to stay were rough-looking chavs with tattoos on their faces, would anybody be complaining that a B&amp;B turned them away? Would we still be claiming that a business should serve anybody who walks through the door? I don't think so. Or if the couple turned up and were loud and annoying, constantly talking on the phone, would we be creating a media storm that the B&amp;B asked them to leave?

I don't think it's right to say that businesses HAVE to serve everybody. In fact, the precedent is already set. For instance, bars and clubs have entrance policies and can refuse to serve people for any reason they like. Sometimes it's dress code, or they might not just like the look of you if they think you look like a trouble-maker. Or sometimes they turn down big groups of guys or they turn down couples. Stores might ask you to leave if your child is screaming and being annoying.

Before mindlessly down-voting, please explain why this shouldn't be the case. If these backward people want to run their B&amp;B in a backward way, they should be free to do so.

full disclosure, i am not from the UK, but am not an american either. Canadian gun owner. We have much looser gun laws, and far more guns than the UK, but fairly similar crime rates. We do have some stricter gun laws than the USA, which i think help a bit(some of the laws), but the larger difference in crime is more likely due to the rampant poverty, racism and prohibition fueled drug/gang warfare they have in some of the more violent areas. 

For instance, there are many areas of the states that are chock-a-block full of guns but have crime rates like canada and europe

Im ok with *some* strict controls, like our licensing system, background checks, references, requirements for safe storage/transport, etc. The ones I generally disagree with are the ""security theater"" (ie, the TSA in america after 9/11) type ones that try to ban certain guns or types of guns that are scary looking, but mechanically similar to every other gun.",0,1345079920,null,0,1345080159,0,c5ttg8j,t3_y64sv,t1_c5ttg8j,t1_c5ttcp6,null,1429650078,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,diablo_man,null,null,"^ i just edited in a bit about the USA you may have missed.

yeah, the more i  read about the three countries, the more i think this is true. An important thing to consider is that the crime rates compared between the three countries have been this way for hundreds of years, long before any of them got strict laws on guns or knives. The British strict gun control is rather recent, and doesnt seem to have impacted the overall crime rate too much. It certainly isnt outright responsible for the gap in crime between the USA and the UK that predates these laws by decades.

But yeah i think in some ways canada could swing to one side or another a little bit (personal freedom from the USA, proper governing from the UK) but it is a pretty decent mix.

While i think the UK went WAY overboard with gun and knife restrictions (like no buying kitchen sets before you are 18 cause they have butter**knives** in them, or that you cant carry any knives other than a swiss army knife, practically) which I see as giving government way too much power in an attempt to safety proof the nation, stuff like the lack of healthcare etc from the states is equally frightening to me in it's lack of foresight.

Well that told me. Oh wait actually, no it's not a silly argument. They're analogies, really.

&gt; it doesn't address the actual principle

Yes, I know. [I made the point a little further down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/y97c4/christian_hotel_owners_take_gay_row_to_supreme/c5thpok)
 
&gt; You just attached a load of emotional argument to make the poster sound like a racist/homophobe.

Hmm no, not at all. Your comprehension is a little off, I think. SouthPads certainly doesn't seem to have got that impression, nor should he. What I did was make analogies to this situation to demonstrate how, when it is applied to circumstances that society in general agrees is discriminatory, this situation was also discriminatory.

I get the impression you don't see this situation as being discriminatory to the homosexual couple in question? Obviously I think you're wrong on that front, if that's the case. More than one judge disagrees with you too. 

&gt; If the couple who wanted to stay looked dodgy... would there be outrage that the owners said they couldn't stay?

Among people who look dodgy, have tattoos etc. then possibly yes, there might well be outrage. However - and this is the important point you're overlooking - the tattood, smelly people haven't historically been discriminated against and as such there is no legislation in place to protect them. Neither is being tattooed and smelly an innate property (well, the smelly bit might but you know what I mean) that someone cannot change. Sure, some people are closed minded about tattoos/smelly, but have people been convicted of being tattooed or smelly, sent to prison, beaten up, ostracised, forced to undergo hormone therapy, lost their jobs, been subject to decades and decades of distrust and abuse... just because of their smell or tattoos? No. Gay people have. Do you see the difference between your example and this case?

&gt; Are we saying that every business HAS to serve everybody?

With regard to certain attributes (race, sex, sexuality and similar) the law dictates that business owners should serve anyone regardless or face the consequences. The reasons for these laws being in place have been discussed in this thread and some people have thoughts on them and think they're wrong. Personally I think they should remain, to avoid potential social unrest in certain areas of the country, but also because I think prejudice should not be entertained in public businesses. Other groups/catagories aren't legislated against (someone made a comment concerning that earlier) such as age or perhaps a personal grudge. Perhaps that will change in the future (I'm thinking under 21 policies) but for the moment it's an iffy area. Feel free to write to your MP.

&gt; So the next time a bouncer tells my friends and I are told we can't go into a bar, I could sue him?

Again, you're making a link between individual cases of refusal of service (like the tattoo/smelly thing) and the discrimination against an *entire group* based on an innate attribute (race/sex/sexuality). A bouncer might not want you in his club because he doesn't like the look of you (gut feeling). This is something you'd have to take up with the bouncer, but clubs etc. generally have the right to refuse business. *However* they do *not* have the right to refuse entry to someone 'because they are gay' or 'because they are black' or 'because they are white' or 'because they are Irish'. Do you see the difference?

&gt; Business should be able to refuse service to people.

Why do you think there are laws against that at the moment - where did they come from and why did people think they were needed?

&gt; But I do think the law is wrong on this one.

In which case you also think the law is wrong with regard to ""not being allowed to refuse service to black/Asian/Irish/Jewish etc. people""? If that's the case, fair enough, but I'm fairly sure this issue was discussed at length by parliament and similar.

Tell me: do you know *why* the court ruled against the Bulls at the original case and also on the appeal?

No they can't - not without a lawful reason. If a club turned someone away on the grounds of race, sex, sexuality etc. then they would be open to prosecution.

I realise I've already said this twice elsewhere, but for the sake of responding to a comment where it's made I'll do it again here:

The examples you give - such as tattood chavs or loud mouth people - are of unsavoury *individuals*. This is not the same as turning someone away based on an innate characteristic such as homosexuality. In that case an entire demographic is being turned away for the simple reason that they belong to that group.

I'm going to go out on a limb here: I wonder if you belong to a minority, if you have ever been refused service for something like your race or sex. Oh, you might have, of course I don't know. But I'm not sure I've ever encountered the arguments you put forward from someone who *has* been refused for such a thing.

Then when they're at the crib, she never hands him or indicates the leaf, she just puts his hand on the crib.

The leaf is laying in the middle of the crib, so it's quite possible that when he looked down he just saw the one side of the leaf and figured it out from whichever half of her name he saw, but he wasn't even there for the whole Gamma forest talk or when Amy got the leaf. Also the way the filming happened it looked like he was looking at the Gallifreyan on the crib. 

Then when she's telling Amy why the she can't read the crib River says ""it's because it's Gallifreyan, it doesn't translate, but this will,"" which to me says that, even though Amy can't read the Gallifreyan, it's still saying something about River. (That answer about me won't translate for you, but this answer will).

I think only the online megastore (UK version) is selling that now.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"**Sahin**: I disagree on the point that he's a ""developing player"". This lad was the best player in the Bundesliga two seasons ago, better than Kagawa - you won't see Man United fans saying that Kagawa is 'developing'. He's not he finished product, of course, but Sahin is much further along his development than Henderson, despite them being of similar ages - and his age is a bonus, not a factor against him.

Either way, with us playing Thursday-Sunday fixtures and Gerrard especially unlikely to play every week, I'm fairly sure there will be plenty of opportunities for Henderson. Also, our CM squad is now at its healthiest level in a very long time - we have 5 first-team capable CM's, Gerrard, Allen, Lucas, Henderson and Sahin, many of whom can play more than one brief (creator/passer/destroyer). We'll have actual options off the bench rather than relying on squad players who get found out (Spearing; harsh but true).

As for Shelvey, Rodgers offered him to Swansea on loan in our first bid for Joe Allen, and I think a season of regular first-team football at a Premier League side would be the best thing for him right now. 

As for us developing Sahin for Real? I don't think Sahin has a future there, else they wouldn't be splashing money on Modric. Xabi's getting old, but from the looks of it Modric will be his replacement and Mourinho has, for whatever reason, decided Sahin won't be Xabi's successor. They also have Esteban Granero, who is unlikely to leave the club because he's a club-grown player, something Real are short of. I expect our deal for Sahin to have an option to buy.

**Tello:** Yes, he's not as proven as Sahin, but he's played and scored goals in the CL, and he offers more of a goal threat than most of our other wide players. We may be developing him for Barca, but the fact is, he significantly improves out squad.

Sterling certainly isn't ready to be a regular first-team squad member, but he's a cut above reserves for sure - a loan deal would be the best thing for him. As for Pacheco, I didn't understand the hype about him in pre-season; he did some pretty stuff, but his final ball was abysmal, and toothlessness in the final third is something we had too much of last season. There's rumours he's being sold, and I'm OK with that.

Overall, our aim should be to get back into the CL as quickly as possible, not develop players to help challenge for a CL spot in one-two seasons' time. For whatever reason, the club has less money to spend than expected (remember the Suarez contract, and potentially those for Skrtel/Agger, come out of the transfer kitty as well), and I'm much happier to see us make quality loan signings than cut-price not-good-enough permanent signings.

true,payco,tennant,Tennant,"This. There's a bit of pitch on the roof, but not very much, and I've never seen so much space used for a staircase up to such a small attic--you'd normally use a folding ladder for such a thing, especially since it apparently opens into the attic anyway.

But if you look at [this picture](http://whopix.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/amyshouse2.jpg) you can see a rather bright light coming through the door jamb, especially considering the fact that it's 9ish at night when that scene takes place. Maybe the trapdoor to the attic is open with a light on, but why would Amelia have the attic open?

Incidentally, two minutes later, as the TARDIS dematerializes, there's a bright light from behind Amelia (and possibly to her left) when the TARDIS light pulses for the first time, but it doesn't happen the second time. I'm not sure that this is at all related to the other light, but it's still odd.

Also of note: in the following scene where Amy is packing her suitcase, the light is still on (meh), and the now open perception-filtered door very clearly has a different trim molding than the door next to it (it's much thicker), and there's a seam in the wallpaper right between the two doors, with the pattern vertically offset by a couple inches between the two sheets.

I haven't seen any other seams in the wallpaper where the pattern is noticeably broken in the rest of the episode (still checking as I write this), *except* for the shiny glue stripe in-line with the second stair on the mysterious staircase (it's visible in the above still). The seam is repeatedly lined up just far enough in frame to be compositionally significant at the beginning or ending pauses of a few different pan shots for that scene, and has caught my eye every time I've seen this episode, but I never really thought about it being significant. Two very noticeable seams in a strikingly elaborate TARDIS blue wallpaper scheme (in a house that throws blue all over the place, for that matter)? One pays off in this first episode, and my bet is that the other, closely related to a mysterious staircase that also keeps getting framed along an important sight line in scenes, will be paying off at some point as Amy's story draws to a close.

EDIT: Actually, if you take a still of Amelia descending the staircase with her suitcase, and compare it to the one I linked to above: the latter makes it seem like the wall juts out significantly around the perception-filtered door, while the former still makes it look much more like just a seam in the wallpaper. I'm going to chalk that up to perception, but I stand by the idea that there's an obvious seam in the wall where this hidden room is; there's just more to the seam than the glue stripe near the staircase.",0,1345102153,null,0,1345102444,0,c5tyqvi,t3_y5y54,t1_c5tyqvi,t1_c5t0oex,null,1429652642,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Part of the problem there is that for low-income families it's generally cheaper to buy 2kg of chips and a pack of frozen sausages from Iceland or Farmfoods than it is to buy fresh veg and fish/meat from a supermarket and even then the decent lean meat is far more expensive than the value stuff that's full of fat and water.   New mothers get free milk and veg tokens, I'd suggest that families suffering from obesity get something similar such as £5 or £10/wk of 'fruit and veg' tokens as well as access to some basic cooking courses.   In fact I'd extend the fruit and veg tokens to anyone claiming a low income benefit like JSA or income support.

Obviously it's not all down to not being able to afford fruit and veg.

This is old ground; the UK legal system disagrees with you, or he wouldn't have been cleared for extradition.
&gt;On top of that since this case has been on going, the US diplomat in Sweden has had many meetings with the Swedish Foreign Office, and further to that America holds a lot of political pressure over Sweden.

America is utterly irrelevent; there is nothing more then conspiracy theories to support the claim that America is planning to take him off Sweden. 

&gt;It's quite convenient when someone on the FBI's most wanted listed, is wanted in a pro America country, and another pro America country happens to feel okay with extraditing him on the grounds of allegations.

Your reference is not what you think it is in two respects; firstly it is Assage's legal team quoting a Swedish witness statement and arguing that it does not describe a crime in UK law. They have not accepted the  truth of the statement. Secondly it does not quote the full statement, which describes clearly consensual sex but includes the allegation that Assange deliberately tore a condom during the sex.

Per the witness statements, he is an abusive arsehole but probably not a rapist.

It's called debt, yes. But earn enough and you don't have to pay. Get old enough and you don't have to pay. Move country and you don't have to pay. Die and your family doesn't have to pay. It may be debt, but it's not the scary debt that people should worry about.

I'm not saying I agree with this system of (effectively) taxing people for their own education. I would prefer taxing the rich for everyone's education. But since university education has diminished in potency, with so many people getting silly degrees as an excuse for a few years on the piss, I can see why you maybe shouldn't expect the rich to pay.

I think it would be better to plow money into creating apprenticeships, and not keep acting like academic achievement is better than any other form of achievement.

You can’t grant asylum to someone to protect them from criminal charges, only to protect them from political persecution. Diplomats are expected to obey the laws of the countries they are in, even if they have imunitity from prosecution, it's still aiding a fugative from the law.

Its a very fine point to make, but it still comes up from time to time. For example, the recent case in China of the disident under house arrest who fled to the US embasy; he was not under house arrest by order of a judge in relation to comitting a crime (but by a local authority), so the US wasn't in breach of any laws by offering him asylum.

So, the only way Equador can accept the asylum case is by deciding that the criminal charges against Assange are purely politically motivated and without merit. Given that the highest UK appeals court has already ruled the other way, this by extension implies that Equador has decided that the UK (and Swedish) legal system is corrupt and not independant.

The social services system is almost always getting it wrong.  They neglect the children who really need to be moved (eg, Baby P) whilst putting innocent children who aren't being abused into care where they *do* end up being abused (the Orkney scandal).  

&gt; So the majority of carers are paedophiles?

I didn't actually say that.  I said that I know (personally) some people who were in care at one point and most of those people were abused, sexually or physically, by their carers.  I have relatives and friends who have been in care and none of them have anything nice to say about Social Services or their carers - even the ones who *weren't* abused.

true,ThisIsMyRedditLogin,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; You said they would 'most likely' end up in the care of a paedophile, ergo the majority of carers must, according to you, be paedophiles.

Given the amount of people who later try and sue Social Services for abuse by carers, it would hardly surprise me if most carers were paedos.  Paedophiles like to be near children - what better way than to be a foster parent?  

&gt; When there's children at stake its' hard not to be too careful, so of course they will cock up, and as with any government organisation there is waste and inefficiency but what else do you propose?

A shake up of Social Services.  They're unregulated and pretty much left to their own devices, hence why they can take non-abused children away from loving parents for silly reasons, just like my aunt did.  Foster carers need to be properly screened too (by an independent body rather than Social Services themselves), especially those that operate the larger homes (which is often where the most abuse happens).  

We've clearly both heard of people with very different experiences of Social Services, so I doubt we're going to find much to agree on.

If your intention was to provoke and cause a disturbance within the B&amp;B, yes they would be within their rights to refuse you. That's an incredibly straw-man situation though, a better example would be if you were dressed normally and were found out to be a far-right member of the conservative party and refused a room solely on those grounds (e.g. you were checking into the B&amp;B like a normal guest and never made an issue of your political beliefs, then the B&amp;B owners suddenly demand you leave because they notice you're wearing an anti-immigration badge).

You may be right that it wouldn't cause an outrage for most people if the person being refused held truly vile beliefs, but that doesn't justify denying them service because you dislike their views. As funny as it would be to have a hotel put a sign in the window saying ""No Tories"", I think they could in theory be sued for it.

&gt; If Tesco told some shifty-looking guy that he wasn't welcome in the store, would there be outrage?

If there was a reasonable concern that he would shoplift, harass customers, or cause a public disturbance, there would be no problem with banning him from the store.

If he was barred because he simply ""looked shifty"" and used the shop like anyone else and there was no evidence that he was doing anything shifty, there would be an issue or at least there should be. 
""Looking shifty"" is incredibly subjective and insubstantial to get a store ban, and it is incredibly open to the prejudices of the shop keepers (e.g. ""that guy looks incredibly shifty, he's a young black man wearing a hoodie he must be up to something"").

&gt; clubs and bars have loads of entrance policies, shops can bar people, restaurants can refuse service etc etc etc.

Yes, based on reasonable criteria such as being respectful of other customers, dressing formally, paying your bill, remaining sober etc. Expecting someone's private life and thoughts to comply with the business' own principles is very unreasonable and bizarre when it neither harms the business, its owners or its customers.

I admit there are a few grey areas here, but businesses are not free to arbitrarily choose who to serve, and while we are free to choose not to go to these places, we shouldn't be expected as customers and members of society to accept that kind of behaviour and ignore it, even when it benefits us.

Also, as it currently stands, you stop paying after 30 years so if it takes you a few years to get a job or you start under 21k and work your way up over the course of a few decades you'll probably still end up paying less than the full 9k.

So I guess we can say poor people pay nothing, middle earners may end up paying more than 9k and the mega rich pay 9k.

Back when my wife got too ill to cook and before up work to look after her I had the same problems, having to fit in getting kids to and from school, whilst working an 80hour week.  Some days I'd work 9-5, drive home and cook a meal, and then go back to work for another four or five hours and find myself doing the shopping at midnight in a mostly deserted Tesco.   

You just have to sit down and plan a weeks worth of meals before hitting the supermarket.  It's not *easy* especially if you've got kids who are picky eaters, but it's worth the effort.  I've got a little app called [Our Groceries](http://www.ourgroceries.com) on my phone that lets you plan recipes and then select and add them to your shopping list.  Once you've got a recipe in there it's just a case of clicking 'add to list', and once you've got a bunch of recipes ready it makes planning a weekly shop a damn sight easier.

A slow cooker can make a big difference as well.  Stick a bunch of veg, some meat and some water in it and turn it on before you leave for work and you'll have stew waiting by the time you get home.  In the summer boil up or steam a bunch of new potatoes in the evening and stick them in the fridge till the next day, add some chopped chives and a bit of mayo and you've got the start of a salad.

true,RandomHigh,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; I'd suggest that families suffering from obesity get something similar such as £5 or £10/wk of 'fruit and veg' tokens as well as access to some basic cooking courses.

First part no, second part, yes.

You can't just throw money at them for healthy food and expect people to change their dietary habits. The second part about cooking courses, or even just a basic course on dietary facts would go a long way to helping people.

Simply giving them money off vouchers for fruit and veg will only leave them more money for junk food.

I'm not exactly an ideal weight myself, but I'm not technically obese. I know exactly why I am overweight; it's because I eat too many biscuits. And I have been running an experiment with my brother recently, and for the past 3 weeks I have cut out almost all biscuits. I had the occasional couple of biscuits at the weekend and a piece of birthday cake at my nieces party, and I've lost a stone in weight in three weeks.

I've not exercised more, I've not changed any other eating habits, I've simply cut out the biscuits. But I'm lucky. My father was always skinny and my mother was always a little on the heavy side. My brother and I have never had problems with putting on or losing weight. It's just genetically easier for some people. For a lot of people, losing just a few pounds is a real struggle.

The recent trend of putting the percentages of recommended daily allowances of certain things on foods has helped a little over the past couple of years, but I don't know many people who actually read those that don't already take a good look at the calorie information anyway.

I think more education is definitely needed.",0,1345116510,null,0,false,0,c5u0avk,t3_yb1ca,t1_c5u0avk,t1_c5tyw8m,null,1429653375,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Calorie-for-calorie, the cheapest butter in the supermarket is 2.5x the price of white sugar.  If you want a good tasting butter then you're going to be paying even more than that.  And then consider that sugar encourages the body to deposit more energy as fat while fat itself does not.  Add to the this the fear of fat and there's your reason why obesity is a malady of the poor today.

But sugar itself shouldn't be taxed.  Ready meals and pre-prepared food should be taxed heavily.  People should be encouraged to make things themselves with sugar and flour.  But they don't, they buy everything pre-made and there is stealth sugar *everywhere* because it is a cheaper source of flavour than fat.

1) It's really easy to get a pre-paid (or pay-as-you-go is what we call them) sim card. Walk into any phone shop and they'll be able to sort you out. Most of the time the deal is something like ""top up at least £10/month and you'll get x texts, y minutes, z data""


2) I'm not an expert on mobile broadband. Your best bet would be to find a pay as you go sim that includes some data. You probably won't get enough for skyping though, might have to go down the internet cafe/starbucks route there.


3) I can't think of anything particularly terrible you would do. Tipping isn't something that happens too often. Maybe after a meal if the service was really good, but never at shops, never at bars, never at cafes.

I know a woman (white, english, lives in England) who was quite terrible. She never cooked meals in the home unless she had a male visitor. (she was divorced) She stocked the cupboards with fast food and fatty foods and as a result the children put on a lot of weight, they even developed stretchmarks. When the children asked what the marks were the mother said they should eat less and that it was their fault, however, a culture had developed where the children stuffed themselves when there was food around. In school they never got any lunches made by her, but if it happened, it was bread (not even butter) with a banana on the side. Someone in the school must have picked up on that there was a problem because eventually they were granted the free basic meals. Her three older children were never taken into care because they weren't obese enough for social services to act, but her youngest one had downs syndrom and so was entirely dependant on the mother and wouldn't in any way regulate her weight on her own accord.

true,metathinking,null,null,"1. Super-easy. Mobile service is miles ahead of Australia. Go for pay and go. There are two types of pay and go: one is like a contract, you put the money on and you get options for the month; the other is true pay and go - you put money on, you get free text/calls/web and you also keep the money on your phone till you use it up. Unlike in Australia they money doesn't run out. I recommend o2s Text and Web: £15 gives you unlimited texts in the UK, and unlimited web and you have £15 for calls in the UK and abroad. I recommend buying the  one-off £4.99 international bolt on to get half price international calls and texts for the rest of the life of your account with O2.

2. Broadband is also so much better in the UK then in Australia. A few years back my Virgin cable was 'shaped' for going over the download limit - at its most restrictive it was still faster than all my friends back in Oz who were paying crazy amounts for connection.  If you move into an existing flat they will probably have it already - you'll be fine.

3. Tipping isn't a big thing here. If anything I've found Australian's seem to tip more than locals. Generally its just rounding up a bit on the bill as opposed to proper tipping. You will generally have to ask for the bill in restaurants - service here is much more patient then in Oz, and aren't trying to move you out as quickly as possible. Have change ready for the bus (buses are exact change) or buy the pack of singles -  they are already slow enough with the tram works!

Exercise without change of diet can do harm for two main reasons: the wrong choice of exercise can cause injury, jogging on pavement, for example, will cause your knees and shins a lot of stress even if you're not overweight.

true,slittyeyes,null,null,"IMO once you have started working for a year or so, it does not matter so much what degree you have or what uni you graduated from. No one is going to remember that 2.2 you got from XYZ uni, being capable in university does not necessarily translate into being capable at a job. Saying all this though, I think university is still worth going because a) you buy some time thinking what you actually want to do in your life before diving in b) opening yourself up to various experience, it is the only time where mistakes here and there would be overlooked  c) networking and develop social skills, pick up life-long friends and experience in the wayd) doing a degree that you are really interested in and love is very satisfying and it really helps with building up self-esteem and confidence e) you don't have to worry about finances just yet (loans, bursaries, fundings, might be work to get them but the key is that you can get them). I can go on with the benefits of university. Now in terms of deciding whether to take a year out because you can't get into a uni you desire, or to suck it up and go through clearing, consider the following: are you adaptable enough to not be jaded and allow yourself to enjoy your new surroundings to the 'not-so-good' uni? How quickly do you want to get your education done and start working (the reason for this is assuming all your friends are doing 3 year degrees, you take a year out you will be one year behind, you will be hearing all about how horrible finals are for them when you are only in second year, and you will go through your finals after hearing all the horror stories, is that going to be ok for you, even though at times you are going to feel genuinely lonely?) If you are going to take that year out, what is it that you want to do? Would you want to go travelling, or try and get some related work experience?

If I were you, I would take the year out because I knew I wouldn't be happy in a uni that I didn't choose to go, reputation of the university was very important to me (well, it was 6 years ago). During the year I would try and get some related work experience, just so that I can bump my CV up and talk about it in interviews and stuff, it will also be mega useful for post-graduate employment. I would not do the whole 'gap year' thing just yet because you can always do that after your degree. I have always try to get the hard stuff out of the way first, plan ahead so that I can see and end to it and relax when it comes.

true,borbus,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; The one thing they could do without getting it wrong is to promote and maybe subsidise vegetables. 

English vegetable cooking techniques are really quite flawed compared to the French and Italian methods.  In France, a plate of vegetables is something you want to eat because it's delicious, in England it's something you force yourself to eat because it's ""good for you"".  In Italy, the vegetables often *are* the meal (Italy is home to a large number of vegetarians).

So yeah, I'd be all for subsidies on vegetables, even if it's paid for by taxes on meat, but we need to improve the way we cook and eat them otherwise our happiness is going to suffer, and that's just as important.

&gt; Also don't you mean encouraged to make things themselves without sugar and flour?

No, there's nothing wrong with doing a bit of home baking.  What I'm talking about is using those raw ingredients in a controlled manner instead of having them as stealth carbs in pre-prepared food.  The first time you make a cake you realise two things: there is a TON of sugar in them (often more sugar than flour), it actually requires a fair bit of hard work if you do all the mixing and beating by hand (which I would recommend).  Seeing the ingredients in their raw form makes you think more about what you're eating, and beating a large quantity of yolk and white of egg by hand could be an Olympic sport!

I did my A-Levels 5 years ago. I had a place at medical school and I needed AAB to take it up. Results day 2007 came around and I was shocked to see I hadn't got the grades. I didn't even have the grades for my back up. I was pretty devastated. My options were to re-sit everything and reapply but some med schools look down on re-sitters and there was no guarantee I'd get the grades.

So I got on the computer and looked up the university courses I had previously discounted. I found one that looked to be perfect; a mix of immunology, microbiology, anatomy, physiology and genetics. I called them up and was accepted, simple.

I moved to that city a month later and had an amazing 3 years. The course was not as intensive as medicine so I had the opportunity to do some things I wouldn't have done otherwise. I met people I wouldn't have otherwise met and learnt things I wouldn't have otherwise learnt.

I still wanted to do medicine so I looked into graduate courses. Now 2 years after graduating I am halfway through my medical degree and I'm on track to have the career I wanted.

So, there's always another way. Look at all your options. I wouldn't change my path to where I am today as it's made me who I am.

If they sell Song they'll have work to do but I don't think RVP made Arsenal at all - he'd only won an FA Cup and a Community Shield with them afterall.

On the other hand, Man Utd have spent £24m (or thereabouts, depending on who you read) on a 29 year old with a history of injury problems - averaged 24 league games a season for Arsenal in 8 years.  If he wins them the league and Champions League again then i'm sure they'll see it as money well spent but I feel it's a bit of a gamble which may not quite pay off (see Berbatov).

Spurs will very much be in a transition year and hopefully they won't replace Modric too easily - even Mountinho will need some time to settle in.  A bit of an unknown quantity at the moment.

In fact there's so much stuff for Doctor Who, that I'm sure it's just a statistical fact that everyone can find *something* they don't like in the Who Universe.

What gets me isn't that you haven't watched every classic episode, or even find any Doctor uninteresting. It's the smug attitude that comes across from some people here that if you don't like the same parts of Doctor Who as they do, then you're obviously wrong. I've seen quite a few times where someone says they didn't like, or skipped entirely, the 9th Doctor, and it's downvote central. Sometimes people even get vocal in how that person *has* to go back and watch it before doing anything else. Hell, people get at me when I suggest people can start with Matt Smith instead of Eccleston/Tennant, even when I give that option as well!

I think we'd all get along better if people just respected others opinions on what they liked/don't like about Who. It's an enormous franchise that's not just full of fifty years worth of television, but books, comics, and audio adventures as well. Just like you're not really into Hartnell right now, others aren't really into Eccleston. It's all cool, because Doctor Who is so much more than that.
