Really, this is all very Day 1 Bill and Ted here.

Anyone here who writes fiction will know that every once in a while you come to a plot loophole that gets in the way of the story you want to tell.  Taking time out to say ""They didn't go this way instead because blah blah blah..."" isn't always a good thing.

But there's no logical foundation to why some events would be ""fixed"" in history and others aren't.

1. Way too much focus on ""community"" aspects.

Just an example - I consider myself a Trekkie, a fan of Tolkien's work, and a superficial Doctor Who enthusiast, but the occasional Reddit post is all I do in terms of community interaction. I use media, a lot - Netflix, Wikis, Reddit - but I keep my fandom mostly to myself.

2. The ""celebrity"" part is very one-sided, and obviously heavily inspired by manic teenage Twilight fandom. I understand where you're coming from, but I'd have appreciated more diversity in the questions. In the current state, I could only smile and check ""Disagree Strongly"" for 90% of the questions.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;the 10th Doctor's enemies felt more menacing: Davros and the Master, in particular.

I think this was helped by the fact that Davros and the Master were already very well-established in *Doctor Who*, long before RTD/10. 

With the Silence, they're hardly nearly as menacing. Part of the reason is how haphazardly they've been used, to the point where they haven't even been mentioned or hinted at in Series 7A. 

As you said, Moffat is too tryhard. Series 6 was mostly about the Silence, with infodumps every third episode. Series 7A being barren of the overarching plot is a relief, but it's overkill. It reminds me of ""The Big Bang"", where at the very end, the Doctor happily buzzes off to his next adventure with nary a thought as to what destroyed the TARDIS.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;Funny since he started out so silly and happy when he first regenerated. I just wish things could be like that for seven sometimes.

Ironically, the TV show couldn't have gotten away with that. Based on what I've read of that era, it was McCoy's comic approach to the Doctor that pushed the series off the cliff. Despite the tone changing as he occupied the role, it was too little, too late. 

&gt; he feels he needs to be in control, to prevent people from getting hurt, to protect them. And the whole issue was raised about how he knew what was best for people. 

That's a great dynamic, which was what I loved about stories like *Ghost Light* and *The Curse of Fenric*. I don't think we've ever seen a Doctor/Companion relationship like that since then. Given how perfect McCoy and Aldred were in their roles, I'm not sure I'd want to, either.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;That has been a staple of all the writers of the new series, though.

If we compare Davies to Moffat on this point, I'd still give the edge to Davies, for this reason: his endings may have been overblown soap operas, but at least they tied things together, however terribly. ""Last of the Time Lords"" was awful, but the plot was within the confines of the story. ""Journey's End"" was sheer Disney (until Donna's mind was wiped), but there was nothing left dangling. ""The End of Time"" went on for far too long, but there were no unanswered questions about the story.

With ""The Angels Take Manhattan"", and the end of Amy Pond as a Companion, there's still so much we don't know. What were those burn marks outside her house? What became of her parents? Both elements were given a lot of importance at the time in their respective episodes, but nothing's happened with either of them. We've seen more of Rory's family than we have Amy's family, and it was Amy's parents who had the mystery around them in Series 5. Yes, we can draw inferences and speculate about these things, but it should be the writer's duty to tell the story, not for us to sift through clues and come up with theories once the story is over. And Amy's story is over. 

&gt;I thought Dinosaurs on a Spaceship was so fun.

I enjoyed that episode a lot, but it wasn't a Moffat episode. Coincidentally or not, the only Series 7A episodes I really enjoyed were the non-Moffat ones. ""Asylum of the Daleks"" was very disappointing, even for me as a Dalek fan. And the less I say about ""The Angels Take Manhattan"", the better for my health.

true,Adamkelt,null,null,"Okay, here's the Cliff's Notes.

The show started in 1963.  There were sever actors who played the Doctor until it went off the air in 1989.  There was a TV movie made in the States in 1996.  Then, the show was revived in 2005 - since then, there have been three actors who've played the role.

I don't suggest going back to the beginning.  It would be hard, having never seen the show before, to look at the classic Who and look PAST the B-movie look and feel, despite the writing quality.

I'd suggest starting with one of the new Doctors.  What I mean is, start the same episode as one of the new Doctors' debut.  It's a nice ""jumping in"" point...

Now, which one?  That's a matter of taste.

9 - Christopher Eccelston - It's an obvious choice as it was the first Who anyone had seen in a LONG while.  You're starting where so many of us started.  The problem is that there was still a period of learning involved, as they relearned what the show's voice was.  It CAN come off not so great, but that's IMO.

10 - David Tennant - Okay, IMO, they've worked out the kinks by now, and he IS arguably one of the most beloved Doctors ever, so there's that.  But, you will miss a bit of backstory by skipping 9 - Caveat Emptor.

11 - Matt Smith - Easy choice - he's the current.  Duh.  But, again, you're missing a lot of backstory, but you're watching the current dude. 

**TL;DR**
So, where to go?  I'd say start with Tennant (Netflix, season 2).  You can go back and watch Eccelston when you want, but let the show hit you firing on all cylinders - which is totally what Tennant's tenure was.  Just plow through Tenant, then Smith, then go back and pick up Eccelston, once you have the love we all do for the show.  :)

After that, you ought to be good to go back and accept classic Who for what it was, and forgive a lot of cheesy effects, etc.

It's why I suggested watching the entire revival first, it will hit all the major high points (what's a Dalek, who are the Cybermen, whats with the potato looking dudes?) without much hassle.  The downside is that you sort of have to watch the revival in order so the emotional impact of some of the moments hold.

The quote/unquote reboot starting with the 11th Doctor isn't really a reboot proper - all past events are still in play, but a new Doctor, a new showrunner, even a new TARDIS interior makes it feel different than what came before.

But that band means they can do LTE now, rather than go into an auction and not know if they'll get anything. Saves money too. I don't think most of the commercially available handsets support 900MHz LTE either - for example the iPhone 5 only supports bands 1, 3 and 5 - or roughly equivalent to the 2100Mhz, 1800Mhz and 850Mhz GSM bands. We don't use the latter, and IIRC Ofcom has not approved LTE use on 2100MHz (and it's even more useless for indoor coverage anyway). So it's logical to use 1800Mhz.

No? http://www.virginmediabusiness.co.uk/News-and-events/News/News-archives/2011/MBNL/ 

&gt; The ground breaking technology is set to be the UK’s only synchronous Ethernet mobile backhaul service. The first phase of deployment will see MBNL harness the power of the 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps) Ethernet service, ensuring that mobile data users will have continuous access to the high bandwidth network. Everything Everywhere and Three will benefit from the increased capacity, enabling them to better transport the huge amounts of data that their combined 35.2 million customers consume when accessing social networking sites, mobile video, mobile music, the mobile internet and applications.

Strictly speaking the cells don't connect to ""the Internet"" directly anyway.

I've seen the plans for this MBNL from Virgin, and it is a bog standard BT WES service. They're going to be able to afford to run less than 1/8th of their cells from it; the remaining cells will be connected as they are now via microwave hops - each one reducing the total available throughput for the next cell.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;We may be sick of it now, but years from now in the future when DW is taking a very different course, we'll miss Moffat.

You speak for yourself :P If Series 7A is any indication, I will not miss Steven Moffat's writing or direction for *Doctor Who*. 

&gt; Angels Take Manhattan was more about Amy and Rory and their parting. So it's perfectly okay if Moffat whips up some random technobabble so that he can deliver us a story about Amy and Rory and their parting 

It still doesn't sit well with me. True, time paradox mechanics weren't the core of the story, but with the Doctor yelling and screaming and crying that he couldn't save them *because* of those mechanics felt like making a big deal out of nothing. I don't like the idea of cobbling together half a story to tell a different, bigger story. 

&gt;It doesn't hold up to scrutiny, well...it's not really supposed to hold up to that much scrutiny. Not the kind of scrutiny us crazy fans give it.

That is very true, and I'll be the first person to acknowledge that these kind of stories aren't meant for those of us who relentlessly and joylessly tear them apart on websites. 

That said...I *do* like it when you can step back from a story/book/movie/whatever, give it some time to percolate, and say... yeah, it's still good. It holds up. None of Moffat's ""big"" stories post-2010 have done that for me. 

&gt;I don't think Blink was very subtle at all- 10 pretty much shouted out from his DVDs at us and info-dumped us at the end of the episode. 

I meant the single, focused use of ""timey-wimey"" to get out of more complicated technobabble - as opposed to how that concept/those concepts were blown out of proportion in later episodes. That said, you're right, infodumping is everywhere in Moffat stories. 

&gt;This is a show about time travel, this stuff should be happening all the time. Considering time travel was rarely a plot device in the classic series, we're just making up for lost time.

Good point - damnably good point - but I think it's gone from one extreme to the other. 

&gt;And big epic episodes of feeling and emotion are not Moffat exclusive... ick the series 4 finale? Series 3 finale?

As I said to FreePatArthur, ""If we compare Davies to Moffat on this point, I'd still give the edge to Davies, for this reason: his endings may have been overblown soap operas, but at least they tied things together, however terribly. ""Last of the Time Lords"" was awful, but the plot was within the confines of the story. ""Journey's End"" was sheer Disney (until Donna's mind was wiped), but there was nothing left dangling. ""The End of Time"" went on for far too long, but there were no unanswered questions about the story. 

With ""The Angels Take Manhattan"", and the end of Amy Pond as a Companion, there's still so much we don't know. What were those burn marks outside her house? What became of her parents? Yes, we can draw inferences and speculate, but it should be the writer's duty to tell the story, not for us to sift through clues and come up with theories once the story is over.""

&gt;That's pretty much the method Doctor Who has always run on and that doesn't bug me. 

I do like that precious little in the *Doctor Who* universe is fixed and constant, but ... again, at the risk of repetition, since 2010, it seems overdone, almost to the point of cliche. There's less by way of straightforward, focused stories, and more on these big, epic, pants-shitting swerves and turns that'll look good in trailers and promotional material. 

&gt;Though, I guess if you don't like sex and flirting in your stories you're going to have a bad time...

Yeah, that's probably just me.

The BBC is only to the left of the Dailymail that's why there is complaint, but they too deify the armed forces and monarchy.

During the leveson inquiry it was found out that the BBC were offered pre-viewing of the Wikileaks cables who said they ""wouldn't touch them with a barge poll"". The BBC's lies are usually lies of omission:

Very much agreed. I got sick of that in *Torchwood*, too. 

&gt;As for Moffat, what he does [...] is leave the little details for us to figure out and use our imagination on. 

For me, though, the details aren't little. Some kind of alien ship actually visited Amy's childhood house, but we don't know who it was or what they did. There was some big mystery built around Amy's parents that never got fleshed out (just mentioned, if that). We don't know how and why the Doctor, Rory, Amy, River and Canton went from presidential allies to federal outlaws in the space of an episode. We don't know how Rory and River escaped the Silence ambush at the end of ""Day of the Moon"". We don't know how or when Amy was switched with a Ganger. 

And yes, we can certainly use our imagination to try and fill in the gaps, but to this level? Where things happen to major characters that are not explained, not referenced in future episodes? That's why I don't think they're little details. 

&gt;At least he doesn't insult his audience

Say what you will, but ""Let's Kill Hitler"" was damnably insulting to the intelligence. I absolutely despise that episode.

true,stop-chemistry-time,null,null,"More importantly here, your *maximum* liability for cleaning is to the level that the property was in before you moved in. Clearly, if you had to clean the carpets upon occupancy, they weren't clean at the start of the lease.

This is a case of ""betterment"" - ie, the landlord is (from your description) expecting you to pay for some sort of net improvement to the property. This isn't allowed.

Did you and/or the landlord have an inventory conducted before moving in? If not, the landlord does not have a leg to stand on. If so, does it reference the poor condition of the carpets? This could be used to support your case.

Is your deposit in a deposit protection scheme? It should have been entered into such a scheme if your tenancy started after 2007 (if it wasn't, and your tenancy started after this date, do some googling. I think if you bring a case that the landlord will have to return to you 3 x the deposit value). The landlord also had a duty to inform you of the particulars of the scheme within (I think) 28 days of the start of the tenancy.

If it is in such a scheme, the landlord cannot claim your deposit without your consent, unless you fail to respond to letters/emails from the protection scheme. If he has claimed against your wishes, then I'd seek formal legal advice...

Now, some other points - look at your tenancy agreement carefully and consider any statements that might be ""unfair"". For example, if the contract says that you must clean the carpets before moving out, then that condition is ""unfair"" and cannot be enforced (it's potentially a case of betterment). Look at [this document ](http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/reports/unfair_contract_terms/oft356.pdf) for guidance.

Consider poor conduct by your landlord during the course of the tenancy. For example, access to the property without sufficient notice, failure to comply with fire/gas/electricity regulations or guidelines, not showing you an energy performance certificate (you'll need to check from what date that requirement was put into place), etc etc.

Now, to the oven. Was it as clean on vacation of the property as it was upon occupancy? Do you have photographic evidence to prove it, or could the landlord have evidence that it was not? These points will be key. If you agree that it needs cleaning, find a cheaper quote (shouldn't be hard) and show it to the landlord. Landlords or agents should really show ""due diligence"" in getting the lowest quotes, but I don't think that's codified anywhere other than ""best practice"" documents, so I suspect some might just get a dodgy quote from a mate and pocket the difference...

Some other things to consider:

Were you present at checkin and checkout inspections? Did you agree the findings of those inspections? Were the inspections conducted by an independent company? Was an inventory and statement of condition prepared and agreed at checkin and checkout?


In terms of your next steps, I'd suggest:
 * Write a letter to the landlord to attempt informal dispute resolution
 * If that fails, state your intent to pursue adjudication through the deposit protection scheme (whichever one you use should have some sort of dispute resolution process)
 * Follow that process, which involves submitting evidence which and adjudicator reads and decides (unfortunately, ""behind closed doors"" and without appeal...).

That assumes that your deposit is in a protection scheme. If not, and it should be, see above and do some googling. If it doesn't need to be in such a scheme, I'd write a letter, then consider writing a letter of intent to sue and going through the small claims courts... if it's a lot of money.

In the claim I'm fighting now, our agents/landlords wanted &gt;£1000 from the deposit including &gt;£200 for carpets.... seems excessive by all accounts.

No.

There are still rules. The doctor can't go back inside his own personal timeline, unless for very brief, unimportant encounters. That was established during 10's run and several times during 11's.

You could argue that this is a younger version of Strax, but that would be impossible. Strax died at Demons Run, commenting how he lived to be 12 years old, which he considered a good life. It's also pretty clear that it was the doctor who made him a nurse, as punishment, for something.

We first meet him when The Doctor comes to pick him up. Therefor, the Doctor has presented the punishment already. The Doctor we see in this trailer does seem to know Strax, but that doesn't mean much. What matters is: this is later in The Doctor's personal timeline.

It's not possible, even by the rules of this show, for the doctor to know about Strax's punishment before he handed that punishment out. This happens, in The Doctor's personal timeline, after Demon's Run.

The Doctor can't consider something an event in the past of his personal timeline, when it actually in the future of his own personal timeline.

He even said so himself during ""The Doctor's Wife"": ""You can't archive something that hasn't happened yet"". To which Idris/The Soul of The TARDIS replied: ""*you* can't"", sarcastically.

Also, The Doctor had to pick up Strax separately from Vastra and Jenny for the battle of Demon's Run.

Strax's punishment hasn't happened yet, if he's with them. How then can The Doctor act on it, during the events of Demon's Run, which is even further before The Doctor hands out this punishment.

I just realized: This was the entire premise of Series 6, the doctor trying to inform his past self of a future event, via his companions, trying to find a loophole somehow and succeeding, with extreme difficulty and the most impossible of luck.

So how's he going to get out of this one? Leave a not somewhere for his past self, about a Sontaran he sent somewhere as a nurse, so that he can pick him up later?",0,1353115882,null,0,false,0,c72kpn2,t3_13bbxk,t1_c72kpn2,t1_c72kd47,null,1430426980,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Borini isn't a great passer, but has done well previously for Rodgers in the centre-forward position (and I daresay his future at the club will be as a centre-forward, he's just not ready yet). They need to be a decent passer, nothing more - Kuyt's a decent enough benchmark for required passing ability.

What's essential is intelligent movement off the ball, to find space for themselves and create space for others. This is why a smaller player like Borini and a bigger striker like Danny Graham are both capable of playing Rodgers' system, because they both share the quality of excellent movement off the ball. That is why Carroll is being moved on - not because he can't pass, but because his movement is poor, and only suited to very direct football (West Ham and his time at Newcastle).

As with any top striker, Cavani's movement off the ball is intelligent, and his physicality in the final third will be a bonus, and will complement our small, agile wide players (Suarez &amp; Sterling). 

Cavani's also great at pressing from the front (1.6 tackles and 1.8 fouls per game, so 3.4 challenges per game; in comparison, Suarez makes 1.1 tackles and 2 fouls per game, 3.1 challenges per game)

Despite the huge season gap, I did not do a lot of reading/speculating on LKH for that very reason so I didn't have many expectations.

true,oag721,smith,Smith,"I had seen the series mentioned around the Internet and Wikipedia and since I love time travel I decided to investigate. I had BBC America, and the new series (this was the sixth series at the time; last year) was premiering later in the month. So I tuned in to the series 5 marathon at various points in the day, and here is what I remember seeing:

I first saw the last few minutes of ""Amy's Choice"", starting with them freezing to death in the TARDIS. Those were the first moments of Doctor Who I saw. Then I saw bits and pieces of ""The Hungry Earth"": I remember Amy and Rory seeing their future selves, Amy being pulled underground, and the Doctor taking of Alaya's mask. When I came back to the TV it was the end of ""The Pandorica Opens"", which was really interesting...I thought that Amy had amnesia, Rory was always a robot, and look, it's a big colorful cousin of R2D2! I saw a lot of ""The Big Bang"" as well, though I didn't see the ending. I actually followed it pretty well for dropping in, because I'm used to that kind of time travel storytelling (the whole business with the fez and leaving notes for Amelia, falling down the stairs, etc). Then I watched the series 5 recap BBCA ran, and it was on to my first full episode: ""The Impossible Astronaut"".

And I loved it. I felt so cheated by the ending--I have to wait a whole week? (I had never actually watched a scripted drama live before, really.) Those first few episodes I saw were great, and I was so caught up with the storyline. I loved how complicated it was, and the characters were fun to be with. The Doctor did take me by surprise by being rather eccentric instead of the wise, suave figure that for some reason I expected, but that's why I grew to love him. There were also so many funny lines--and Nixon!

Year and a half later, and I've seen all of the new series and I'm working through the classics.",0,1353128223,null,0,false,0,c72nb0a,t3_13bvs4,t1_c72nb0a,t3_13bvs4,null,1430428189,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

As others have mentioned above it's still possible for your family to object even if you're on the organ donor register *and* you carry an organ donor card. The most important thing is you tell your family that you want to be an organ donor, then even if you're not on the organ donor register they can say yes to it.

I would guess the reasoning behind the card is probably basic psychology, if your family are presented with ""do you want to give his organs away"" vs. ""he's carrying a card that says he wants his organs to be donated"" they're much more likely to say ""okay"" to the latter vs. the former. When you're in the situation where you're being asked to consent to giving your family members organs away it's much easier to ignore the fact that you're on the organ donor register with things like ""oh well he signed up in 1985... he's a different person now"", if you're carrying the card it shows a concious effort to have your organs donated saying no would mean they had to be consciously objecting to what they *know* are your wishes. 

Anyway, yes, sign up and make sure you carry the card :-)

true,RobertM3,tardis,TARDIS,"A step by step how I made these shirts. First attempt should be done on a junk shirt to get use to how it is done

1. I moved the Tardis picture into Word and resized it to the size I wanted and printed it out(might need to print it a few times to get it how you want it)
2. I taped the print out to some stencil paper. Hint: I taped over it completely to make sure it didn't move
3. I cut out the inner white parts and then the outline of the tardis with the stencil ontop of an old phone book so I didn't have to worry about cutting too deep. Tools I used were a metal ruler and an exacto knife.(best done this way to keep it strong) Also you really need to watch out during this part, because your hand might slip and cut it wrong. I did a few times. 
4. Then you poke out the cut out parts and might have to make a few minor cuts to get some parts out completely. Be very carefull when working on the window area.
5. For the first one I just had some old news paper and magazines to put on the inside of the shirt to give the stencil a stable surface and prevent the bleach from bleeding through to the other side of the shirt. The second one I  had a cardboard t-shirt form I got from hobby lobby. gives a better surface, but I still put some newspaper between it to protect the cardboard.
6. Now I put the stencil some newspaper sitting on it's front and sprayed the back of it with some adesevive spray and waited the non permantent direction time for it to sit. Then put it on the shirt and waited an hour to make sure it stuck.
7. I took the outer part of the stencil and placed it around the tardis stencil to protect the rest of the shirt from the bleach. I then added some more newspaper to protect the rest of the shirt.
8. I poured bleach into a spray bottle and filled it up with the same amount of water to lessen the concentration. You could try a stronger concentration, but you don't really want it to bleach too much if it ends up in a wrong place.
9. Sprayed the stencil lightly and used a paper towel to absorb the excess moister on the stencil. You don't want the stencil or t-shirt to get too soaked or it might bleed through. A warning, using a spray bottle is going to bleach it spotty and you might get impatient and spray too much.
10. I let it dry for about 20 min, but you can decide on your own amount of time.
11. Keep spraying and letting it dry till you are pleased with the inner bleached part. As I said earlier, you might get annoyed and want to spray too much because of spotty bleaching. One way I got around this is getting part of a paper towl slightly soaked in bleach and dabbed in the areas that needed more bleaching.
12. After I was happy with the tardis bleached part I took off news paper and the outer stencil part off, but left the tardis stencil on. So now the rest of the shirt is exposed, but the tardis stencil is still on protecting the shirt.
13. Now this is where I added the background affect that I like to think of as outer space. All I did was from the bottom left corner I sprayed above the shirt towards the upper right corner. Then I did the same thing, but upper right to lower left. You want to do this light to see how it comes out.
14. Let it dry like you did earlier and then keep spraying to add to the look. If you are wondering how I got that bottom look on the first one. Remember I just had a magazine and newspaper in the shirt and so I had to fold it behind itself and that was a fold that only exposed some of it.
15. Once the background is done, I took off the tardis stencil. Be careful, if you want more than one use out of it you'll want to make sure not to tear it.
16. Now the shirt is done, but you are not. I then tossed it in the dryer, because the bleach when dried stays in the shirt. I then rinsed it twice in the sink with cold water.
17. After it dried some I tossed it in the wash ALONE on the most gentle setting. You might want to do this a second time to make sure the bleach is out of the shirt. The first shirt was destroyed by letting it sit over night and went straight into the wash.
18. The shirt is done and I don't really have anything else to add for after yet.

This is ridiculous logic. Just because ""all sides criticise it"" doesn't mean it is not biased, it means ""all sides criticise it"". I suppose you believe coverage of monarchy is neutral, like the Jubilee. It's been quantified—on the Israeli coverage at least, that statistically there is bias.

In the previous attack 14 Israelis died to some thousand Palestinian. One would not have gotten that impression from the coverage. The flotilla deaths were again not covered properly. The Gaza strip is an open air prison housing over a million Palestinians, again this idea is understated.

It's funny how I have an ""extreme"" view, anyone who criticises the BBC is extreme. That's a bizarre statement that offers no concrete semantic weight, but an emotive dismissal along the lines of ""these people's opinions aren't credible"" and need to be overlooked.

The first tried to charge us through the nose because many of the lights in the property weren't working, this was because the light fittings were obsolete and we couldn't get bulbs for them any more - we told them this before we moved out, they sent an engineer round but he looked at the wrong lights, and they tried to charge us his fees too. DPS sorted that out.

Second property, we spent a day cleaning and touching up the decorating, doing the carpets, oven, etc. Tried to charge us for cleaning the entire carpets in the place again because there was one spot we missed *inside a wardrobe*, among other things.

true,avatarv04,tardis,TARDIS,"So, some of these can be answered.

* Yes, it seems that River knows the Doctor's name before she dies. It also seems that in the Wedding of River Song, she doesn't yet. Given that the Doctor's name appears to be an important plot point, I think it's clear that the story of how she knows the name is a part of the Doctor's story going forward from here, and we'll get some sort of answer on that front.

* The TARDIS explosion was caused by the Silence. It was their first attempt to kill the Doctor, and it caused all the cracks in Season 5. I don't think the Doctor knows how the Silence managed to do it, nor do I think we'll ever really know. The explosion, after all, never happened in the rebooted universe. As an aside, Season 5 is problematic because a majority of it never happened. It really messes with any real attempt at continuity on the show.

* The Silence feel that something bad will happen if the Doctor is asked to speak his name (or basically, answer the question ""Doctor Who?"") and go to great lengths to try to make sure that, as the saying goes, ""silence will fall when the question is asked"" because the Doctor won't be there to answer it. The question itself has been asked multiple times - the Doctor doesn't really answer it ever. The only person whom we know knows the name is future River. Which means, at some point, the Doctor does answer the question.

* The Silence are an integral part of the current story arc. Despite the events of Season 6, I don't think they're quite finished yet. They'll play a role at the Fields, and so will River. Given that he will at some point reach the fields, and he does at some point answer the question, it's logical to think that River finds out his name then, and the downfall of the Silence happens then as well. It should also be noted that that's also when ""the fall of the Eleventh"" occurs - ominous tidings for this regeneration.

* I don't think there's too much to the last point. She's deflecting but the point is that I think she enjoys her current life as it stands too much than to give that up and travel in the TARDIS.

After a few minutes later, I don't know why but somehow I started watching it. The episode was from Season 2 Ep. 4 aka The Girl In The Fireplace. What can I say. So much raw emotion from that single episode especially from someone who never watched it before then. I was hooked. The time traveling aspect and characters/villians also caught my attention. It was a wonderful episode (which I will never forget) and I'm so glad to have caught it when I did. 

Then the next episode came on which was, The Rise of the Cyberman cemented me as a fan of the show. Seeing Rose trying her hardest not to tell her alternate universe parents who she really was hit me right in the feels and truly seeing the time-travel aspect of the show. The next day I was checking out the on-demand on my cable (Comcast) to see if they had any Doctor Who episodes on it. Sure they def did. Sad to see that they only had Season 6 and 7 up. For sure I watched all the episodes from both seasons and I was officially a real fan all within 72 hours time.

I have heard people say everyone remembers their first Doctor. David Tennant was my first :).

Where I used to live, young drivers were encouraged to take the IAM's course and were refunded the fee by the council on passing. I took it (you'd be a mug to pass on free education) and I'm a far better driver for it.  
  
Every year the number of road deaths in the UK falls, but the number of 17-24 males dying stays relatively stable. The answer isn't restricted driving with fewer freedoms, the answer is better education and more experience. If people can afford to spend longer learning they will become safer, better drivers.   
Unfortunately though, driving is expensive and I know many people who learned to drive at 17 (or did an 'intensive course') and haven't driven since. They do this because when they eventually get a car they'll have cheaper insurance (despite being inexperienced and ill educated drivers).

Arsenal played well. Lets be honest. They had a decent game, not a monster, but they were far from underperforming. 

And what did we do? Start on fire. And then lose a player. I ask, what on earth do you expect the manager to do. I don't know who will read this, but you cannot, with any good conscience, blame AVB for this loss. The wind was taken from our sails **the moment** that Adebayor walked off hanging his head for a challenge that quite honestly, deserves whatever he gets. 

As for Howard Webb. Did all the calls go our way? Of course not. Were there some 50-50's? Sure. No ref is ever going to get it right. But, lets be clear, we lost this game on Ade's red card. And that call was fine.

This team has a lot of talent, and a lot of good chemistry. We have had injury problem after injury problem and are still trying to create an identity in the midfield, which takes time. Try to keep this in mind before we all pass judgement.

Keep the faith. Love the shirt

Adebayor looked really good for 15 minutes, though he seemed to fade away after that, don't know what happened...
Lloris played a good game aswell.
It's really fucking obvious by now, that we need to get a central defense of vertonghen + dawson/caulker going, I don't have anything against Gallas - he does to his best and works well for what it's worth, but he's not good enough to let a future great (Caulker) sit on the bench (Though that wasn't the case this game).

The back-3 system looked to function and helped us push up better, trying to get a better hold of the game, but being outmanned since the 18th minute really took a huge toll on the players and it's very obvious that they were just getting really tired.

Clint had probably the best 45 minutes he's had in a Spurs shirt. Still a bit rusty, played (by necessity) in a system that didn't suit him, but he tried to get more on the ball and make something happen. He does still have a long way to go, but improvements are great.

Tom Huddlestone looked more comfortable with the ball I think, and we went out there being the best team.
Tom Carroll looked very good in the 20 minutes he had on the field.

Give him some options in front, make runs forward, either to receive the ball or to pull defenders away.

We need to press harder, get more men in the box (as always), and play more aggressively. Now that Suso's off (why?), I don't know who's going to fill the hole behind Suarez. Henderson certainly isn't. It's probably Gerrard, but I can't really tell, since he's still dropping back a lot.

Suarez said that this game is a must-win. And it is. C""mon lads!

Edit: Apparently Suso was off as a tactical change.

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"hehe this is genuinely funny, if you ever have kids you will know why.  Teenagers who take great offence to the following will most certainly agree with me in 20 years time. 

As a teenager you think ""I will never be like *you*"", then after you leave home it dawns on you that your parents are not that bad after all and that it was not in fact magic pixies that did the washing up, paid all the bills or did food shopping. The next step in your journey towards becoming a boring old fart is to start grumbling about the price of gas and whatnot.

 Then you have kids and no matter how many times you say that you will never be like them, you find yourself saying all the things they said to you and you will get exactly *why* they said these things in the first place.  Hypocrisy be damned, it's all about having half an hour to sit down and have a cup of tea with a nice slice of cake in a house that does not smell, without having to worry that the children are doing something stupid/destructive/damaging/annoying anyone else.  

That's from age 8+, before 8 you spend your life making sure they don't get themselves killed or maimed. There is *nothing* and I mean *nothing* that a 7 year old would like more than to play with your kitchen scissors. If they have a crayon a small dog and the bath as well then that's even better because they can stab themselves while drawing on the wall  while they are waiting for the water to overflow out of the bath that the dog is now swimming round. 

One of my particular bundles of joy once uttered the immortal words ""MUUMMYYYYY VANAS IS ON FIRE!!""  ('vanas being the smallest and fluffiest of my three dogs) I abandoned my dinner making and ran upstairs to find that small dog was indeed on fire.  She did not seem to mind this, but got quite upset when I grabbed her, still on fire, and hurled her into the nearest water source which was the toilet. Turns out she ""looked cold"" so exhibit B had turned the fan heater on. Dog had curled up right next to it and gone up in flames - don't worry, she has a double coat of fur, the top coat being fluffy the bottom being wire, only the top burned and her skin was fine. 

The other of my spawn once decided that my black whippet/greyhound/saluki was rather boring looking. So one night he bided his time pretending to be asleep and waited till I was in the bath. I was doing my hair when I heard laughter coming from the kitchen and legged it, stark naked with shampoo still in,  down the stairs and found my kitchen, the child, and the dog were all bright red. Once I had taken a second to evaluate the situation I concluded that exhibit A had got himself a sieve and had liberally sprinkled flour all over the dog, he had then found two bottles of red food dye and poured it all over him. I looked at the boy and he gave me a shit eating grin, pointed at the dog and went ""Clifford!""

true,elapid,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"I think age should be taken out of insurance completely. I have a theory that if it was combined with capping profits at 15% like they do for medical insurance in the US then prices would go down.

My other idea is for a kind of insurance investment. Basically you get a loan with the insurance company for a certain amount and they hold the money and invest it. The profits of that investment pay your premium each year so once you have paid back the loan you never pay insurance again. 

If you decide to stop driving you can cancel and take the money out once you have finished paying for the loan. Insurance companies get their money for the insurance and also get interest on the loan but once it is paid you have free insurance for the rest of your life. 

I would guess the loan have to be around £30,000 to pay them £900 a year with a 3% return on investment but as you would get most of it back one day it wouldn't be a bad investment. For cars like Ferraris you could take out supplemental policies to top it up. It would probably mean about £200 a month for about 15 years so no insurance after age 32 if you started driving at 17. 

Of course something would need to be done about inflation but as insurance gets cheaper as you get older that might help to balance it out.",0,1353168511,null,0,1353168922,0,c72se26,t3_13ck2t,t1_c72se26,t1_c72rx2j,null,1430430652,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,westerchester,null,null,"You know, River Song is the reason I'm not keen on Stephen Moffat at the moment. 

He created a character who Ten met for the first time as the Doctor, where we discover that she is incredibly important in his future. The Doctor, knowing and understanding this, had to watch her die, and therefore must bear the rest of his relationship with her knowing when and how she dies. Every time he would meet her in his future and get to know her more, he had to subtext it against her death. More importantly, no matter how many other stories they could share together, they had to have River meet the Doctor for the first time, and get to know him. Moffat could have done anything with River's story, he literally had access to all of time and space to create that story. 

And what did we get? The next time we see River (and every subsequent time we've seen River), we completely disregard the fact that this woman died telling the Doctor how much she loved him, and how much he would come to love her, and make all of their interactions snappy one liners. Are you joking? 

Oh, and let's not get started on Let's Kill Hitler. All of time and space, and you made River into some semi Time Lord who just regenerates into River after spending her whole life growing up as her mother and father's best friend of the same age (never mentioned before that episode, I might add), and then tries to kill the Doctor, but despite being raised as a weapon against him, just decides upon the first time she meets him that she's going to save his life. 

Two things, Moffat:

1) The Inception Clause: just because it's more complicated, doesn't necessarily mean it's better. 

2) Stop telling and start showing again. It's one thing to say that the Doctor and River have all these adventures where they get to know each other, or to say how magnificent the Doctor is, and another to show the audience so they can believe what is being said.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"Hello everyone. This is /u/BritishImgurian on my new account (I never go on Imgur anymore so it was an outdated name) but I’ll be carrying on my post game analyses. Sadly, it was a 3oc kickoff today so I was streaming on my horrific broadband. 

**MOTM - Sturridge.** This was a pretty difficult one for me this week because I thought everyone had a rather poor game until 70 minutes in, and even then we weren’t fantastic. He started on the side and pushed to ball into the box, moving it around. He was moved to the middle 30 minutes in and started to push even more and create some moves. Around the hour mark he was moved up top and personally I thought he was the striker we have been craving for a while now. I know he didn’t score and as I said it wasn’t a great game by anyone, but he made a lot more space, some great runs and unlike Torres – took chances! That said, he still wasn’t anywhere near clinical enough to warrant us not needing a new striker (as discussed later).

**David Luiz is still not defending.** It’s a shame that possibly one of the greatest football personalities in the world is just so unreliable. I always feel guilty for getting angry at him… but he keeps giving me reasons for me to be angry at him! It’s great to see a defender who can add to the attack with the creativity and control he offers, but he needs to learn that he is still a defender first, which means he defends. Shane Long was given far too much space because of Luiz’s sloppy defending and the team paid the price for it. He isn’t the only one to fault though – Bertie made a similar mistake in not defending a cross leading to a goal. The difference is Luiz’s mistakes are becoming annoyingly common.

**Hazard in the middle?** A couple of points here.  It was interesting to see Hazard in the middle. This is a position he has confessed to preferring when he was still in France and there was speculation over where he would go and where he would fit in. What I found even more interesting was he was then pulled out wide after half an hour and played better before scoring the equaliser. Seeing as Hazard was *the* creative player in that midfield (Sturridge and Moses are attackers, not really creators) it was interesting that he could not take Mata’s/Oscar’s place as the central creator and instead Sturridge was drafted in to the centre.

**A weekend of rest.** Ivan, Cole, Ramires, Oscar and Mata all started on the bench – as well as Marin but that’s another point. This was clearly a weekend of rest ahead of our big midweek game against Juventus. This left us with Romeu/Mikel in DefMid, a slow connection between the defence and the attack which still didn’t work well as a doubly defensively-minded couple because we conceded early and kept letting the ball straight past us for Shane Long to get his shots in followed by another damn header! /u/GaryCahillForJesus has pointed this out multiple times – our squad as a whole simply isn’t good or deep enough and when we’re playing the longest season yet with Charity Shield, European Super Cup, Club World Cup, Champions League, FA Cup, Capital1 Cup and a 38 game PL season, we need a squad that can win games much more convincingly against teams like WBA when we need to rest some players. As soon as we went down the second time we got Mata and Oscar warmed up proving that we are too reliant on them.

**Why does RDM hate Marin?** If you want to start Sturridge, don’t start Torres (playing yet another anonymous game) and place him at the front. Marin has shown so much potential in the pre-season and in the reserves that he really needs to be trusted with *at least* half an hour of play, or even 1 minute! Sturridge is not a midfielder. He is a forward. As I stated in my previous comment, we’re too dependent on our 3 starlets and revert straight back to them whenever we run into a stick of bother. Marin isn’t injured at the moment – he just isn’t played. Today was the last “easy” game until 1st of December, so Marin most likely won’t play until then at the earliest . A true waste of talent.

**Torres won today’s hide and seek competition going 62 minutes unseen.** His biggest contribution today was getting in the defenders’ way. Last week he at least put the effort in, even if he didn’t put many shots in. This week he was back to his usual lethargic self, effectively making it 11 vs 10. Sturridge goes up top? Has two great chances in less than two minutes. You may say “oh well he still didn’t score them!” Torres didn’t even take two attempts at goal. He never made the space or the runs or the effort. I hope the doubters can now see that we need a striker in January because it is getting clearer every game.

**AVB was fired for losing this game.** Now I’m not saying RDM is anywhere near losing his job, neither do I want him to. I think he’s a complete Chelsea legend, a great manager and the man to offer stability. All I will say is that Roman (the real one) has incredibly high expectations and the media speculation and pressure will grow if these kinds of games persist. I know it’s November, I know it’s just a bad run of games, but the speculation will definitely be growing and we’re going to have to be ready for that because it’s going to be annoying as hell to listen to.

**Yet another mountain out of a molehill.** We let them past us for a solid 60 minutes before we manned up and put the pressure on. Considering how much we were dominating at the start of the season, our current form is appalling and we are making every game harder for ourselves. You can sense the desperation in the last 20 minutes of every game now and it keeps happening. Even Cech had to come up top at the end (making more of an effort at scoring than Torres all game…)

For the breakaway pass from Mata, there's no way that he'd even get there.

Anyway, I'm covering well-worn ground here. We were inept until Mata and Oscar came on, yet again showing the complete lack of viable options we have in our squad.

We can't defend. Luiz needs to be dropped, he's been utterly shit for close to a month and a half. Less time dicking about on social networks, more time learning how to be a defender. I'm rapidly coming round to the idea that January 2011 was an absolute disaster - £75m on Torres and Luiz. Luiz I think can still turn it round though.

This season is turning out to be just like last. Started well, high scoring games masking our terrible defence. Have one shambles of a game where we went down to nine and fell apart from then on.

We desperately need a squad. And some of you lot think we can win the league? Jesus Christ. Absolute crap.

For those wondering about the Suso substitution, it was a tactical switch to change the midfield triangle.

**Before:**

        Suso

    Allen    Gerrard

**After:**

    Hendo    Gerrard

        Allen

Harsh on Suso, but he doesn't really have the defensive game to play a deeper central midfield role. Henderson did decently, and we controlled possession far more after the switch. Good substitution by Rodgers, credit to him for not just letting the game drift.

---

We're still attacking predominantly down the left, and rectifying that is something that should be our second priority in the transfer window (though I don't expect it to be addressed until summer) - Wisdom's doing fine for a kid, but he offers next to nothing offensively on the right, and generally isn't capable of bringing the ball out of our half the way Johnson can on the left.

----

Sterling's movement off the ball has improved - he's linking up delightfully with Suarez now, and towards the end of the game he moved into central positions when Suarez dropped wide/deep. Rodgers will be pleased with that.

I've driven people to appointments, shared a car to work, drove my friend to Hospital once, but I rarely have to drive with a family member in the car. They have their own cars and their own places to go. 

Simply, young drivers aren't bad drivers, they're inexperienced and reckless. They push it too hard, not always because they have people in the car, quite often because they can and get out of their depths. This isn't something you can cure with a 'better education' because people always want to push harder or show off. Its a stupid decision but its one that most people make when given something new.

The police don't help much, always targeting the youngest drivers, the amount of times I've heard of a young driver being caught and given a speeding ticket for doing 35 in a 30 is ridiculous. You aren't helping.

From personal experience the absolute most dangerous drivers in this country are this..
German car drivers. BMW's that sit 4 inches off your bumper in the rain on a motorway, the worst ones that just stay in the middle lane and expect you to just magically move out of their way, they could go in the fast lane but they're not paying attention. Audi's that cut through the traffic in both lanes. Always the same kind of people, if anyone drives you know the ones I'm on about.

And the second worst is old people. Old people cannot drive for shit. Toodling along a 60mph stretch of road at 35. You come around a corner doing 50 and find one of these fuckers sitting there you're going to have to be pretty sharpish on the brakes. If you didn't know to look out for them, say, you were inexperienced, you'd crash.
And then they drive at 30, still, around a carpark, pull out of roads without looking. Get shit scared in narrow lanes and where theres room for 2 cars to pass take up both sides and make you reverse for 5 minutes till they feel comfortable.

I suppose my point here is that, theres bad drivers in many different forms. Inexperience is something only cured by more experience. Lessons aren't experience. You're helped and taught, but you aren't left to make your own choices and mistakes.
So its about time the bloody government left young drivers alone.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; Insurance companies work on statistics and probabilities - they can't distinguish you from a reckless driver until you've driven for a few years without a crash.

Except they don't. They work out their statistics and probabilities, then they charge people based on what they can get away with (as with all businesses). There is a stereotype that young drivers, particularly males, are dangerous drivers, and yet when you run the statistics, you find that older drivers (post 50) tend to ~~be involved in~~ *cause* more ~~accidents~~ *incidents* because while they may have the experience they don't realise that their reaction times (and observation skills) aren't as good as they used to be. But the stereotype means that they can get away with charging young males higher rates.

Of course, in practice this just means that those rich enough to afford insurance still go around driving recklessly, and those who can't end up stranded (given the price of trains, and the availability of any other kind of public transport outside London). Or they just drive without insurance, which creates all sorts of trouble later on.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I've had a big smile on my face ever since the second goal. We were amazing in the second half. First half, we were pretty ""meh"".

I have no idea who to name as MoTM for me. Enrique? Suarez? Sterling? Sterling was absolutely brilliant in the second half today, and so was Enrique. Suarez was just there to finish (and brilliantly at that), and this is one of those games that I'm happy to see Suarez doing rather simple, one touch finishing, because it shows how we don't have to over-rely on his ""I-will-dribble-past-the-whole-team-and-score"" thing going on.

Pretty unfortunate for Suso to have been subbed off, looked quite frustrated. I'm not sure if he was frustrated at himself or BR for taking him off, but I hope he stays happy and doesn't want to leave Liverpool any time soon. Also a bit unhappy that Sahin isn't playing, but he hasn't had too many good games and I'm expecting him to play against Young Boys, since he hasn't played this game.

On the other hand, Henderson was doing great. Maybe could have done better with that one chance he had, but to be fair he isn't all that quick and Enrique's ball was a tad unexpected. Henderson, along with Allen, was making sure the ball was always with us and always gave our lads in front the choice to pass back to them should they need to. Great from them.

Agger and Skrtel were quite solid, I'm quite happy at the clean sheet, although Reina wasn't troubled too much. I haven't seen the statistics but I'm pretty sure Wigan had few shots on target. Reina looked a bit nervous at times, but it's probably due to lack of playing time. I'm hoping the competition Jones is providing will improve his form.

Gerrard was doing well as well, nothing much to say. Oh, and Johnson. That guy was fantastic. So many times he made overlapping runs down the left to pull defenders away, allowing Enrique to cut in and play the ball to Suarez/do something magical (which he seemed to be capable of doing today). Enrique wouldn't have so much space if not for his runs.

Overall, I'm delighted at our display in the second half. More of that, please. In the first half, we played like we did (in the first half?) against Chelsea. Lackluster, excessively patient, uncreative. But with Sterling and Enrique's pace and creativity in the second half, we managed to pull out some brilliant plays today.",0,1353172186,null,0,false,0,c72t2lq,t3_13cszz,t1_c72t2lq,t3_13cszz,null,1430430986,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

Look, I have every sympathy with you here, but ""involved with"" is not the same as ""causing"".

Car insurance seems a very competitive industry to me, proven by how widely quotes can vary.

For every insurance company that is charging exactly what they can get away with, there's another insurance company that's undercutting that price. 

The fact that they had to be coerced into removing gender discrimination shows that insurers *do* base their premiums on statistics.

Insurers would like nothing more than to charge everyone the same price, then they could save time when selling coverage (no more long phonecalls with hundreds of questions about your history) and sack all their expensive statisticians. But this would put prices up for everyone else, and they'd get exploited by the high accident demographic.

If you think insurance companies can charge what they like then I guess we all know what your next entrepreneurial venture will be. Please post back here when you're able to offer us all a quote.

The issue is that we don't want to become predictable, where opposition teams know we're going to predominantly attack from one area.

There's definitely something to consider there, especially when you compare him to the fearlessness shown by Shelvey, Suso, Sterling and Wisdom this season, and the seamless transition of Joe Allen into the side.

You're right that he plays a limited role this season, but it's a chicken-and-egg thing; does he seem anonymous in an attacking sense because of his limited role, or has he been given a limited role because he's been anonymous in an attacking sense? 

I think it's the latter - a good example being the game in Anzhi, where he got into the box, should have taken a shot but instead tried to lay it back. That confidence to take risks seems lacking. 

Either way, he put in a very good performance today, but again it was in more of a holding/shuttling role than an attacking one.

Everything I see where people are getting quotes in the £3-5k range are people who are ludicrously young, getting either overpowered cars, or typical ""ricer"" cars.  
The simple fact is that if you want your insurance to be relatively cheap, then you need to get away from something that looks ""cool"", or goes like shit off of a shovel, and get a small city car, 3rd party insurance, and build up NCD.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; The fact that they had to be coerced into removing gender discrimination shows that insurers do base their premiums on statistics.

No. It shows that they were able to charge men more. Now you'll note that they're planning to charge men a bit less, but women a lot more (so are using this as an excuse to bump up premiums).

The industry may be competitive (or may just seem that way - I spent a while trying to get some quotes in various areas, but wasn't prepared to give up enough unnecessary personal information), but it is competitive as to what it charges, not what it actually costs. The insurer doesn't care whether they get their money from, provided they get enough. This leads to them giving all sorts of discounts and reductions to older customers (to keep them from trying to swap) no matter how dangerous they are, while charging new drivers extra because they have less choice.

Of course insurance companies can't charge what they like and be successful (and if you look closely, you'll see that I wasn't suggesting that). But what they charge is limited by what the market will let them, not what it actually costs them. Obviously they have to ensure that their income is more than their expenses, but they don't have to match it up pound for pound (and if they did, that would pretty much negate the point of insurance).",0,1353177089,null,0,false,0,c72u5c5,t3_13ck2t,t1_c72u5c5,t1_c72t5pu,null,1430431485,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Not necessarily - it can be, but it really depends where the ""2"" and ""1"" are positioned, because the 2 midfielders in the 1-2 aren't as high up the pitch as the attacking midfielder in the 2-1.

Think of what happened today as a switch from a 4-4-1-1, with an attacking midfielder behind the striker, to a 4-1-4-1 with a holding midfielder, because that's really what it was. When you see it that way, it's obviously a more defensive midfield setup; so it's not that Gerrard and Henderson were playing as attacking mids in the 1-2, they were just ordinary central midfielders, a position which requires more defensive work than Suso is currently capable of.",0,1353181470,null,0,false,0,c72v5cr,t3_13cszz,t1_c72v5cr,t1_c72uut7,null,1430431953,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

And i am familiar with mitchell and webb through the very popular comedian jimmy carr. Anyway long story short, i wanted to know what this gameshow the OP posted is, but instead i found out that the people who post on /r UK are INCREDIBLY sensitive xenophobes.

He has four goals in the Premiership, it is only still November.  Chelsea's style has dramatically changed this season and it is going to take time.
The simple fact is...there is no defender in the world who relishes facing Fernando.
Roman might be wealthy but he is a businessman.  On all accounts Chelsea could have had Hulk this year but did not fall to the stupid demands of either club or agent.

Things are getting interesting! 

I don't know how I feel about Gwen, I've always loved her and now I want to smash her face against a tree for attacking Merlin! Is it magic or has she really been brain washed or what?! 

And the next episode. With Merlin both falling off the cliff and going into shock on the floor actually made me shout no. 

They're attacking Merlin now. Which is way more interesting than anyone attacking Arthur even if it's just a side thing. Next episode looks like it's going to be amazing. 

But this episode has sort of convinced me there will probably be no redemption for Gwen unless they take the cheap way out and have it said that she's been magicked into acting the way she is. It looks like Gwen is going to be out in the open about attacking Arthur and hopefully that will surely come out.

I don't want Gwen to go. But I like what they've done with her character even if it isn't what I wanted. At least there's more proof that Merlin has Arthur's full trust, so I'm interested in seeing how that will play out with Merlin and Gwen against each other.

But that teaser for next week has left more of an impression on me than this weeks episode (which was great) so that's saying something.

In a 60 you don't expect to come across a Nissan micra doing 35. People shouldn't have to drive slowly to watch out for the people who are unable to drive at the speed limit.

Then you're a dangerous driver and you should consider how your driving effects others.

You going round a corner too fast because you think you have to keep to the speed **LIMIT**, is sadly a mistake many people make.  It's all too common on tight twisty country roads to see dickheads chancing going too fast round blind corners.

Could be a cyclist round that corner, someone walking, an horse rider, a farm animal, the scene of an accident (caused by a dickhead not slowing down enough) etc etc etc.

Like you said, you don't expect it, doesn't mean there won't be a hazard as you barrel round the blind corner at a totally inappropriate speed.

It's funny, by admitting you won't slow down on a corner with limited visibility, you're one of the very people this article is on about.  A young driver willing to take unnecessary risks.

From 2007 to 2011 the number of people charged with dangerous driving has fallen from 4705 to 3271. The conviction rate has stayed the same. The fall was quite constant year on year.

So are there many fewer drivers on the roads now compared to 2007? Or have drivers gotten much better in those few years? Or are we just catching fewer and fewer of them for lack of looking?

Compare these figures to the people caught speeding or the rate of parking fines. I doubt those numbers have fallen by 30 percent. The truth is that this crime is ignored because there is no money to be made and no automatic form of enforcement.

Now the government feels the need to crack down. But it's not willing to spend the money actually catching people for actually commiting the crime. Why bother when it's much cheaper and easier to crack down on stereotypes like young men?

You were right to ask for evidence. What took me 20 minutes on Google Must be known at the DfT.

What really concerns me is that about 200 people a year are causing death by dangerous driving. So if we are catching and convicting people at comparable rates then that means 1 in 20 dangerous driving events leads to a death. Do you think that is accurate? I don't. I think fewer than 1 in 1000 dangerous driving events kills someone. So then our approach to dangerous driving is to wait until the driver kills someone before we act. But our reaction to young drivers, fewer than 1 in 100,000 of whom kill anyone seems to be a near blanket ban.

&gt;I'm against private property, not usufructory possession and use.

I think this works all well and good in the theoretical but not in practice. Particularly where there is limited supply. It seems to me that the only way to satisfactorily determine who gets access to something of limited supply is for interested parties to bid what they are willing to for the item in question. This is, in very abstract terms, what happens in a market.

----

&gt;Yes. Proudhon has a good quote on this - ""Laws: We know what they are, and what they are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.""

Smith also has a good quote on this ""Society, however, cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another. The moment that injury begins, the moment that mutual resentment and animosity take place, all the bands of it are broke asunder, and the different members of which it consisted are, as it were, dissipated and scattered abroad by the violence and opposition of their discordant affections. If there is any society among robbers and murderers, they must at least, according to the trite observation, abstain from robbing and murdering one another. Beneficence, therefore, is less essential to the existence of society than justice. Society may subsist, though not in the most comfortable state, without beneficence; hut the prevalence of injustice must utterly destroy it.""

You could of course argue that you can have Justice without law, but I'd contend that mob justice is the very worst form of anarchism. Mob justice is not fair, but entirely born from the desire for revenge. True Justice is fair and impartial, and for that you need a legal system which operates independently.

----

&gt;Definitely, but of course, any remotely libertarian upbringing would act against this (parenting, education, etc.) I definitely think the current economic system, and the hierarchies it supports, engenders and exploits go a long way towards explaining the racism, sexism, heterosexism, gender-identity prejudices, ableism etc.

And a remotely libertarian upbringing doesn't preclude capitalist economics. Indeed most people who identify as ""libertarians"" are socially and economically liberal. They are the very definition of free market capitalists.

Some of the interviews with those involved are very telling, but it's actually a fairly in-depth look at some very complex issues rather than merely banker bashing (though there's some of the latter).

I watched it, and it confirmed my earlier claim that the main cause was debt (see the extended system about the Securitisation Chain).

It also confirmed one of Smith's main points - you cannot have functioning markets or society without Justice. If you have people operating outside the rules, and with no responsibility, they form cartels and maximize their own profit to the detriment of society. This is covered in *Wealth of Nations*  Book IV, Chapters VIII onwards.

In fact it seems that the whole crisis would have been averted if the derivatives market had been regulated. Of course the ideology of the people in power prevented this happening and no laws were drafted. Therefore I argue the failing is not capitalism but *Justice*. There were no laws in place to prevent the kind of cartels and cheating that Smith warned about, and therefore the free market drifted naturally towards its' default state of having a few people cheating furiously to maximize their personal profits, and we all know what happened next.

As an aside, I was surprised how well the IMF came out of it. I've seen a lot of people (usually libertarians) blast the IMF, but they predicted and warned of the crisis before it happened.

&gt;I'd argue that it does. A worker-owned business is by definition socialist.

You say you'd argue, but I don't see any arguments.

Remember that I'm not arguing that the *current* system is perfect capitalism or even good capitalism. I'm arguing from the perspective that capitalism is, at it's heart, the system under which labour can be freely exchanged for commodities via capital, and capital can be freely invested by individuals to fairly compete with each other to produce more commodities. (Cutting out details like how a government should function, etc.)

Therefore, I do not see how a worker owned *company* is anything but capitalist - the workers own shares in the company, the company works to produce value for its shareholders (the workers) the workers exchange their labor for capital, and the company thereby produces commodities which are sold on to produce profit to deliver that shareholder value. This all seems to make sense under the capitalist model.

&gt;Indeed, self-employment as a sole trader is pseudo socialist (Marx actually called it the ancient system of production, but it's non-exploitative)

Presumably only if the sole trader doesn't pay tax? Otherwise it's just mini-scale capitalism.

&gt;I don't buy that John Lewis or the Co-op are strictly worker-owned businesses. I can go into detail if you wish.

No it's fine, I was just using an example of a differing ways of organizing a company. 

&gt;Mondragon corpration

Interesting example. I'll bang the capitalist drum again and point out that if people paid more attention to the ethics of the companies they bought from, companies like Mondragon would be able to compete more easily, as consumers would happily pay more for something that they preferred the principles behind.

Again this is fully integrated into Smith's model and can be exemplified in spirit but not in reality by organic food. People buy organic because they think it's more ethical, and are willing to pay more for that.

Of course, again, people are extremely selfish, and therefore they don't pay as much attention to these things as they should (for a given definition of ""should""). Ultimately I think the failings of anarchism, socialism, communism and utopian capitalism are the same - people are too fucking selfish to work together to the required extent. We're programmed to try to fuck each other over as much as possible by evolution which requires only the survival of the genes, not the overall wellbeing of the people. And that's the entire point of having a state and a system of Justice.

To address your first point, we were approaching this project from a group dynamics standpoint, which is the reason behind all of the community questions. I agree that we might have gone a little over-board however. I'll definitely take that into consideration if we decide to run this survey again. 

As for your second point, I absolutely agree that that particular questionnaire is a little extreme. We did not create it, so we relied on the information about it found in the literature search.  The questionnaire has many dimensions that it attempts to address, one of which is a ""pathological"" dimension to celebrity worship. I debated leaving that dimension out for this survey, but decided to keep it in just for fun. I will reconsider in the future, however.

Bertrand - last year he impressed me but on the last line of defense he hasn't this year specifically the second goal him and Luiz got mixed up and I think Bertrand should have gone out to the ball and Luiz defended the cross

Luiz - didn't play well at all, he really annoys me when players back into him he gives away easyfouls by putting his arms into the back of the opposing players heads he did it a few times vs shaktar and did it against long

Cahill- wasn't too impressive did get muscled off the ball to easily once was one of his worse performances

Azpi- actually looked the most solid at defending in our back four did provide the cross even though I think he was aiming for Torres needs to improve his delivery into the box still

Romeu- looked better in a way than he has in previous didn't give the ball away as much as he has done I actually thought he did his job quite well it seemed when he was on Mikel was given license to roam up the pitch a bit

Mikel- great at defending but im not sure how  a player who has trained at chelsea for quite some time doesn't have at least a tad more invention and creativity even though it isn't his job you feel like this is an area he could improve on and be a truly world class player

Hazard- scored a goal however here is where the Torres treatment compare this performance to him at the start of the season its not as good as he can produce some people are saying he was good I disagree people forget the lack of responsibility the attacking midfielders have they should produce more

Moses- I have recently been crying out for him to get more playing time and he had his moments however he lacked the final ball or shot which really isn't good enough considering the spots he got into

Sturridge - I would score 20 goals a season if given a chance how about you score one, Mata made him look good but lets be real if torres missed all them chances we would blast the hell out of him

Torres- With out initial formation with hazard just behind he struggled and the other chelsea players were to close to him when sturridge played just behind him he got into the game more and had some nice interplay with sturridge and other players maybe they can actually play together however he didn't play particulary well it would have been interesting to see if he fared better with a fully firing mata on

Mata- made a real difference and got into the space between the two west brom lines of defense and made several incisive passes that sturridge wasted and looked shard and bright an improvement on recent performances where he has looked sluggish

Oscar - i originally was going to say he wasn't that great but he did set up sturridge on a platter so that was positive he however was a improvement on Romeu however that should be expected

If you could be a little more specific about which particular questions irked you, I truly would appreciate it. 

We unfortunately have to rely on previous work that has been done using fans as populations, so the nature of the questions was not necessarily determined by us. I agree that the celebrity questionnaire is not the most appropriate for fictional characters, but we wanted to give participants some leeway - some people might not be as invested in a ""celebrity"" as they are in a fictional character. Next time I will probably add in a separate questionnaire that pertains to fictional characters.

Again, we are not trying to be aloof about fans at all and I apologize if anything seemed offensive. I really would appreciate any tips or additional feedback if you have it.

What I'm not OK with is Gwen being a clone of Morgana. Smirking every time somebody isn't looking and plotting a new failed attempt at killing Arthur. I was already getting pretty bored and annoyed with Morgana's stupid smirk every episode, now Gwen is making herself pretty unlikable - even when she gets back to normal I'm not gonna like her anymore because her character all season has been either completely flat or completely annoying.

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"I think we're fine on center backs. Yeah, Carra is ending his career but as he showed against Chelsea he can still do a job. Physically he may be declining but his experience and his concentration are a massive boost. Coates is inexperienced and makes mistakes occasionally but you don't learn if you make mistakes. Great player though, and I haven't even mentioned Wisdom in his proper center back role. We're fine for center backs. 

Striker we obviously need. Pick a day, pick a different rumor. The flavor of the day is Soldado, no telling who tomorrow will be. We have a striker incoming its just a matter of who. Pick one of the following: Sturridge, Walcott, Huntleaar, Soldado, Torres and we're linked.

With Enrique's new position I think we need to reassess the left back position so Johnson can move to the proper right back position. Wisdom has been doing great but just doesn't offer enough going forward for us right now.  

As much as I love Suso he just isn't a right or left attacking midfielder or inside forward, he just doesn't have the right defensive work ethic for it and I think one more inside forward would help us out a lot. You could see today how having Sterling and Enrique in boss-mode gave Wigan so much trouble.  The obvious answer is Tello who we hear about every transfer window for the last year-and-a-half but I hear Hotly from time to time.

Midfield we're obviously set.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"Why should a company pay more tax than they're legally obliged to by law? The point in a business is to make money not stuff the government's coffers with tax revenues.

Most people who shout about taxing the bankers bonuses, punishing the rich or enforcing tighter tax regulations don't actually understand anything about business or tax. Every change to tax law ends up with unintended consequences, as we saw with Osborne's budget disaster over this very issue.

The problem is in how bloody complicated the whole tax system is. For a start you have National Insurance, Income Tax and Capital Gains all taxed at different levels completely. Companies get Business Rates that punish you regardless of how much you make and then Corporation Tax only taxes profits. They may have all made sense when they were first created but now it's just ridiculous.

Closing loopholes is futile, either the whole system has to be reformed or the rich will always get away with paying less than the working class.

I wouldn't call personal tax avoidance or corporate tax avoidance ""greed"". At the end of the day they're just defending their hard earned money and they're legally entitled to do it. By contrast people on benefits don't contribute anything to society, they often never work and spend their lives living off state handouts. This is the real greed.

The people I feel sorry for are the working poor who are having their energy bills hiked as a result of green initiatives, food and petrol prices increased because of green taxes and cost of everything else increased because of VAT. Then they have to often deal with life in areas of high crime thanks to Labour's soft on crime policies and a broken welfare state that rewards idleness.

Mata found Sturridge twice, Sturridge nearly found Mata at the end, and Sturridge just provides so much more that opens up defenses than Torres just idly standing by or going to deep into midfield to play the ball to.

I thought we played much much better football the second Torres was off. Granted Mata and Oscar came on, but watching the way Torres has played...he offers nearly nothing in an attacking sense other than pulling defenders away. Sturridge does that and turns defenders easily. (He did that right the minute Mata came on..Torres never makes those runs)

Not sure how you feel he doesn't fit into our style right now. As it is, if hes fit, hes going to score much much more than Torres will. Drogba called Sturridge our most natural finisher once.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I think this works all well and good in the theoretical but not in practice.

That, of course, is an empirical question, and one which is very hard to test under the current global economic system which very jealously guards its hegemony and precludes the establishment of alternatives.  Small scale experiments are sometimes possible, but then their very scale puts them at an enormous disadvantage, and where they prove successful, they are quickly squashed.  Thatcher's rape of the TSB was a good example of this.

&gt;You could of course argue that you can have Justice without law, but I'd contend that mob justice is the very worst form of anarchism. Mob justice is not fair, but entirely born from the desire for revenge. True Justice is fair and impartial, and for that you need a legal system which operates independently.

I'm very equivocal on the law, and this from one for whom it was his life at one stage.  They always taught that justice was the shadow of the law, but I don't see how capitalist law delivers justice (I've seen too much of the opposite), and it's certainly not fair nor impartial. ""Mob justice"" is obviously a pejorative way of stating justice for the majority, and I fail to see how justice for the majority is any less just than justice for the small capitalist clique, as we currently have.  Justice for who can afford it or push the levers of political power to their cause.  Of course, the idea of a republic as compared to a democracy is that it protects minority interests, which is a nice idea, but it's not so nice when it protects elite interests, which is where republics inevitably gravitate.  The difference with anarchism is that it is so constructed as to ensure that radical and direct democracy serves the interests of all, and that the minority interests which are defended most fiercely are those most alienated from the levers of power.  This is the thinking behind systems such as consensus decision-making and participatory decision-making/economics etc.  Those who have the most say in a particular decision are those whose lives are most affected by it.  But anarchism is, at heart, about diffusing power, decentralising, denying all authority but that which can justify itself before intense scrutiny from below.

&gt;You say you'd argue, but I don't see any arguments.

Well, I wasn't sure that it needed argumentation, it's definitional.  Socialist definitions of capitalism, from pre-Marxian, through Marx to the modern day, describe it as a system where those who produce the economic surplus are alienated from it.  So, in slavery, the slave is alienated from his labour, under feudalism, the serf had to labour two days a week on the lord's land, and under the standard capitalist business model, a worker loses a portion of his labour in profits to the capitalist owner.  Under socialism, the worker receives the full fruit of his or her labour.  Those who produce stuff, own, control, share and/or distribute their own surplus howsoever they desire.  This is true of both genuine worker-owned businesses and of self-employment, and therefore these are socialist (or compatible with socialism and non-exploitative if you prefer).  

Socialism is not necessarily anti business, nor anti trade, nor even necessarily anti free-market (in the case of market socialism) .  Nor can capitalism be described as ""the voluntary exchange of goods in a free market"" as revisionists would often have it.  Instead, capitalism is a specific economic system where the means of production are privately controlled by a small group of capitalists.  Usually, in the case of large capitalist corporations by a small elite Board of Directors numbering a dozen or so, and another dozen major institutional/individual shareholders.  The institutional shareholders are cross-owned by similarly small groups of other Boards etc.

&gt;Therefore, I do not see how a worker owned company is anything but capitalist - the workers own shares in the company, the company works to produce value for its shareholders (the workers) the workers exchange their labor for capital, and the company thereby produces commodities which are sold on to produce profit to deliver that shareholder value. This all seems to make sense under the capitalist model.

In a worker-owned company, rather than some hybridised form where the workers have a small interest, the workers own _all_ the ""shares"" in their own company.  There is no Board except one which they themselves comprise, and no shareholders but themselves.

&gt;Presumably only if the sole trader doesn't pay tax? Otherwise it's just mini-scale capitalism.

Well, under a anarchist system, tax as such doesn't exist, because there's no State to pay it to.  Mutual aid via the consolidation of resources for community projects wouldn't be unanarchist though, so long as it was agreed in an anarchist way.

&gt;Interesting example. I'll bang the capitalist drum again and point out that if people paid more attention to the ethics of the companies they bought from, companies like Mondragon would be able to compete more easily, as consumers would happily pay more for something that they preferred the principles behind.

I'm certainly not opposed to a more ethical capitalism, in the sense I'm pragmatic enough to take any improvements in the lives of the worst off I can get (I'd push for more, but it'd be an improvement on today).  And yes, companies like Mondragon would have a much better shot in a world which was less ruthlessly capitalist, or where people were more informed and picky about who they did business with, where they purchased things, etc.",0,1353220372,null,0,1353244254,0,c733kv9,t3_12sgtp,t1_c733kv9,t1_c72y1do,null,1430436060,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Mata hasn't even played those sort of balls to Torres, and that just shows how different in their play they are. Torres has to me, become a goos support striker. We shouldn't be relying on him to be the main man up front anymore..he just isn't up to par with any of the top strikers let alone strikers West Broms strikers. Shane Long completely bossed us around even as a lone striker against Luiz and Cahill. Torres just isn't up to standard.

Both of Torres and Sturridge have decent hold up play..Torres tends to dribble past people and try to do it all himself every second game, whereas Sturridge uses pace and just gets past people and just doesn't have the right decision making skills (similair to Walcott)...Torres has had PLENTY of time to prove himself and so far, hes done alright..but doing alright just isn't good enough for us. 

And on the shots on goal comment. At least he has shots. Torres tends to do NOTHING with the ball. So many times this season Torres has just watched play go idly by him in the box. He is definitely doing better than last season..but his running is constantly ruining any flowing movement we had. He has become so immobile and drops deep way too often. We've spread play so many times only for there to be NOBODY in the box because Torres has gone galavanting into centre midfield when its his job to be either making runs to open up space or even have a presence in the box.

Download pingplotter.  Set it to ping www.bbc.co.uk and fire!  Next it will find all the hops between you and the beeb.  The first 7 or so will be routers on virgins network.  Find the one on the edge of their network and start pinging that instead, once a second (for short traces, or once every 15 if you'll be pinging for days), and leave your PC pinging away for at least hours, preferably days or all week.  Watch the graph build up.  You should not see any red, red is dropped packs (lost data).  If you see any, the network is screwed around the router where you see the red (Man-chess-toh probably).  Get a screenie and ram it down their throats.  Or better still consider leaving, especially if you can get BT Infinity because they probably won't be able to do much to solve it.

Tourism is mutually beneficial for Britain and the EU.3.7 Million British tourists visit Germany year year, assuming each person spends about £250, which would be a very cheap holiday indeed, Brits bring in at least 1 billion pounds to the German tourism economy. I should imagine the numbers in France and Spain are yet higher. On the other side, London, in terms of tourists, is the most visited city on the planet.  There'd be too much to lose by everyone.

It's worth remembering that the UK is the only state that isn't a part of the Schengen Agreement, if you've ever flown between two Schengen countries; from Germany to France for example, you'll know that your passport isn't checked at all except by the flight attendant at the door of the plane, and when you get out on the other end there are no immigration controls you just pick up your bags and stroll out.

The UK isn't part of the Schengen Area, we're the only EU country which isn't and there are actually a few non-EU countries that are part of it too. This means we already have passport controls from flights coming from Europe so not much would have to change really.

We've been through so many internet providers...

We used to have NTL and everything was fine. We switched to cheaper providers, none of them cable, and then the internet was so shit, with it dropping out constantly. None of the customer service teams could help and they all eventually blamed the BT phone lines which go into our house. BT couldn't/wouldn't help, either. 

So, NTL gets taken over by Virgin, so we are literally then forced to go to them because they are the only cable option left.

When my internet works, it's great. I don't honestly have that many problems, certainly not the sea of issues other Virgin users have. My main problems seem to be that I need to reset my router A LOT. My Mac often cannot find the signal when I turn it on in the morning. I also find that when using Skype, the connection goes and I need to reset it.

Last night I was trying to use Youtube and it was painful, then my friend on her phone using my Wifi said ""the connection is gone?"" my Macbook still had a connection, and said it was strong, but it was just so painfully slow it was like dial up.

I ASSUME these are equipment issues more than issues with Virgin? But I don't... know?

I quite like Virgin.

He's quite right that, certainly as start ups, many of these most entrepreneurial of businesses are pretty much run as communes - until they go for major funding and sell stock.  Growth and funding have always been the Achilles' heel of mutualist and communist business models fighting for breathing space in a capitalist world.  There's no fierce incentive for a worker-owned business to grow massive, because as it does so it takes on more members and the wealth is shared.  Only capitalist businesses where a small insatiable clique is raking off all the profits are driven to expand at all costs to workers, the environment, quality of life, etc.  Competing non-capitalist businesses only do so because they realise it's a case of grow or die.

One of the biggest issues is that the coaching staff do not have the ability to create the defensive strength needed. Perfect example is when Steve Clarke was around and the amazing coordination of defensive players we had. Eddie Newton is a Chelsea legend but has not shown the tactical awareness to assist Di Matteo defensively yet.

I hope this will be corrected or I have a feeling Abramovich will look to get Guardiola in at the end of the season (if not before). 

Yes, we were defensively better last year in the CL run, but that was also emphasised by a tactic that was 11 men behind the ball and counter attacking, purely counter attacking.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"With ADSL it's a technology issue though. Your speed is heavily dependent on distance from the exchange and how heavy people around you are using it.

Virgin's fiber optic network eliminates both of those problems, in theory. Distance doesn't matter much and it should be capable of sustaining you and your 9 neighbours at relatively high speeds.

The problem is overselling and lack of upgrades.

If they dug a hole into your street of 10 houses and put down a connection capable of 500mbit then they could sell all 10 houses 30mbit and everyone would be able to use it at full pelt whenever they pleased.

They don't do that though, they share that 500mbit pipe between two streets and sell everyone 100mbit so just a fairly active amount of usage drops everyone below their potential speed.

I've said it before, It should be illegal. Along with their traffic throttling systems. They should be treated like utility suppliers. The Electricity Board don't sell you *upto 24hours/day* of electricity then cheap out on actually providing it, blaming your neighbours for boiling the kettle too often. You pay for electricity and you can use it all day every day if you want, it's their job to use the profits to create an infrastructure capable of delivering what they sell.

I pay for 30mbit internet. The price is the same every moment of every day. I should, barring obvious unavoidable technical faults, be able to use the full 30mbit all day every day to do whatever the hell I please. If they want me to share my allocation of bandwidth because they sold too much they can take money off my bill.

Just as an example, the theoretical capability of a 30mbit connection (Virgin's basic package) is 324GB/day. Their [traffic management policy](http://help.virginmedia.com/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=2781&amp;CURRENT_CMD=SEARCH&amp;CONFIGURATION=1002&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;USERTYPE=1&amp;LANGUAGE=en&amp;COUNTY=us&amp;VM_CUSTOMER_TYPE=Cable) says they will start artifically limiting your speed after 7Gb.

&gt;Half of our trade is with the EU by the looks of those graphs. HALF. You need to get real.

By the looks of those graphs, but even the HMRC knows that the elephant in the room is even Europe doesn't know how much trade is worth because if it enters or leaves the EU27 from any port that is where the trade is designated as originating even if it then moves onto another EU country.  If it arrives from outside to the EU in Estonia or Poland or Malta or Greece or Spain or Ireland before being shipped to the UK, it's counted as EU trade, even if it has made in Australia or Russia printed on it.  Vice versa if it goes to Amsterdam before leaving the EU it's counted as an export to the EU.  It's a terrible state of affairs.

Where did you get that information from? 

Yes it does do a lot for you. The Schengen agreement removed all border controls between signatories of the agreement. This means you can fly from Germany to Spain for example, without a passport. There are Schengen sections in many airports within the Schengen zone which don't even have border officers checking passports.

It also allows people like long-haul truckers to drive from Spain to as far away as Estonia without once being stopped for border crossing formalities.

&gt;What does this mean for passengers?
Under Schengen, border control of people travelling between two Schengen countries is abolished. This means that a person travelling from one Schengen country to another will not go through passport control.

&gt;Design of the airport for Schengen purposes
Copenhagen Airport has changed its layout so that Schengen and non-Schengen passengers can be kept separate.

It's simple. The default position is that it is banned. That's the same pretty much across the entire world.

I've moved down the street before (maybe a hundred metres), taking my Virgin Media service with me, and it went from being completely bombproof in the first property to shitty and unreliable in the second. Turns out I transferred 'rings' in the move (regions of the area all tied up together) and the second one was shittier.

Third move, same issues. Not with them any more.

The worst thing about Virgin is their issue resolution. The customer service is great - very friendly people - but they can't get anything done to save their lives.

It takes days to get an engineer out to you.

It takes days of repeated calls to wade through the red tape before an issue is escalated far enough to warrant serious investigation.

It takes WEEKS or even MONTHS after that for the issue to be resolved, if the issue is beyond your local cabinet.

Examples:

- The 'ring' is under high utilisation (over-subscribed). Just need to hope they bother upgrading the hardware in the near future (haha). Potentially no fix at all.

- There is a problem with the equipment beyond the cabinet (takes a couple of weeks to to resolve in my experience, after a lot of escalation and engineer call-outs to diagnose).

- There is a problem with the firmware on your stupid Virgin Media hub - a frankensteinian smash-up of a cable modem and a router, inferior to both. This bullet took OVER A FUCKING YEAR to resolve (officially a few 'months' before the new firmware rolled out but it didn't resolve the problems if I remember the threads) and fortunately, I dodged it completely. I dodged it by insisting that these abysmally shite new hubs wouldn't work with my equipment and I needed to activate an old cable modem. Boom - good performance once again.

true,87liyamu,uk,North-East Derbyshire,"Probably. Political parties spring up all the time, and can go on to have a major impact on politics very quickly. Sometimes they last, sometimes they don't.

The Labour Party, for instance, was founded in 1900. By 1906, they had 29 seats in a 670-seat Parliament. This raised to 42 in 1910, and the 1920s collapse of the Liberal Party allowed the Labour Party to reach 142 seats in the 1922 election, making them the official opposition. The first Labour Government formed in 1924.

But that rise to power was slow compared to other notable examples. The American Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists in 1854. Six years later in 1860, the Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected as President of the United States.

In Germany, the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (Nazi Party) was founded in 1919, and by 1924 had 32 of the 472 seats in the Reichstag. By 1933, the Nazi Party had enough seats to appoint their leader, Adolf Hitler, as the Chancellor of Germany.

More recently, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) was founded in 1993, when several Conservatives were unhappy with the Government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty. UKIP now has 12 seats in the European Parliament, and frequently polls in third or fourth place in British elections, on a similar level to the traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats.

In Sweden, the Piratpartiet (Pirate Party) was founded in 2006. By 2009, the Pirate Party had [over 49,000 members](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Swepirate_graph.png), making it the third largest party in Sweden, by membership. In the 2009 European Parliamentary Elections, the Pirate Party achieved 7.1% of the Swedish vote, earning them 2 MEPs.

If any party is likely to ""emerge"" in the United Kingdom anytime soon, it'll probably be UKIP picking up some votes from the [56% of people that would like to leave the EU](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/nov/17/eu-referendum-poll).
