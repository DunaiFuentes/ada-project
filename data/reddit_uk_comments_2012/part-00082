I totally agree with everything you said - baby boomers, banks fucking everything up etc. But let's be honest - WE as citizens are a large part of the problem. That's what the quote said. We can blame banks, blame older people, blame politicians. But really, WE are at fault too.

Yes banks were irresponsible. But that didn't stop stupid, greedy people from taking out £450k 110% mortgages on mediocre salaries. Nobody put a gun to their head. They saw a ""good offer"" and took it. And it didn't stop people from taking out a shitload of easy to get credit cards and not paying them back. It's a cycle of greed, caused by both banks and people. Most people have debt now. Nobody has savings.

Same with most things. We bitch about our local stores all closing, yet everyone shops at Tesco regardless. Even when people protest new Tesco stores, they're still super popular because they're cheap and convenient. We ARE lazy and entitled.

Most companies, banks and politicians are just giving us what we demand. It's that classic case of ""be careful what you wish for"". Our own greed and entitlement is our own worst enemy. We want things cheap, we want them now, we don't want to wait or save etc etc. And no surprise, banks and businesses want to profit off this, so we get reckless lending, spending and debt. I'm not superior - I'm exactly the same. Hearing about how my parents lived without chairs in their house for months until they could afford them seems like a whole different world. Now anyone would just take store credit or something.

But as I said earlier, it's the middle people who get fucked over. I'm sure that life on the dole isn't amazing for most people, but isn't it a mess when you can actually be worse off from working? My Reddit enhancement suite says that I've upvoted you +8 times, so we probably agree about a lot of things.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"Seems like you're new here. Welcome! :)

First off, no tactic is 'perfect'. At times we could be too cautious or defensive under Rafa, and Rafa's 'perfect' pressing machine took several seasons to build - something no other manager since has had (rightly so in Hodgson's case). Even in our title challenging season, we lost out because of too many drawn games at Anfield.

As for the 3 managers you mentioned, it's hard to say with 100% confidence what they'd do at Liverpool, because you'd hope/like a manager to adapt his methods from club to club. But, based on what they've done in the past, here's some general conclusions:

**Rodgers:** The focus is on possession - getting the ball by having every outfield player press/close down the opposition when they are in possession, and once you have it, keeping it with short passing. It's OK to pass backwards, and Rodgers' team 'rest' by just circulating the ball around until they see an opening or opportunity to attack, at which point they play with a higher tempo. The formation is a 4-3-3 / 4-2-3-1, depending on how attacking one of the CM's plays.

**AVB:** Another 4-3-3 with short passing, possession, and pressing. Honestly, it's hard to say how different his system is to Rodgers', because most of the main differences could be attributed to the fact that AVB's managed top level teams (Porto &amp; Chelsea), while Rodgers worked with mid-table / underdog sides (Swansea) - things like AVB using a higher defensive line, or being more attacking, etc.

**Martinez:** He only switched to the 3-4-3 late last season; before that he was also a 4-3-3-type manager whose team focused on short passing and ball retention (see a trend here?) Even when he switched to 3-4-3, his team could transition to a 4-3-3 shape quite easliy; the wide men in the midfield 4, the wingbacks, drop into conventional fullback positions while the central defender pushes up to the base of the midfield 3. However, Wigan tend not to press as much, probably on account of them being underdogs. They play more counterattacking football. It's hard to know whether this would still be the case if Martinez coached mid-table or top-level side; perhaps not. 

**Comparing flexibility:** Despite his squats and lunges on the touchline, AVB seems to be the least tactically flexible (so far). He inherited a squad at Chelsea that were the polar opposites of his philosophy, and once he didn't conduct an immediate overhaul in the transfer windows, he perhaps should have compromised on his system in his first season and chosen something more likely to work with his team. But since Martinez &amp; Rodgers have never really been in his situation of working with a squad so ill-suited to their philosophy, it's hard to say whether they'd have done it differently; Rodgers' recent press conferences, where he talked about the system being influenced by the players at his disposal, suggests he might do things differently.

**Youth academy:** We came 3rd in this year's NextGen series, which is basically a European U-21 competition. (Inter won, beating Ajax in the final, and we beat Marseille in the 3rd place playoff). Having said that, in the group stages we came 2nd, well behind Sporting (Portugal), who lost to Inter in the knockout stages, while Ajax beat Barca in knockouts. We have a talented U-21 squad, but 3rd was probably a bit flattering. 

In the Reserve league, we came 2nd in the Northern division, but were well behind Manchester United. Man City don't enter a team in the reserve league. All in all, I'd say we have one of the best youth teams in England, and the first team should begin to reap the benefits of that in the next few years.",0,1341113558,null,0,false,0,c57vsji,t3_vufhd,t1_c57vsji,t3_vufhd,null,1429269667,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

* Then iron the wax side onto the undies. Make sure you put some cardboard or something inside the underwear so the bleach doesn't bleed to the other side, that would be weird. 

* Then take a 50/50 water/bleach (not color safe bleach, I tried that, it doesn't work) in a spray bottle and squirt a light mist onto the clothes. 

* Then immediately dab with a paper towel to make sure the bleach doesn't spread how you don't want it. After giving it a look, once the bleach changes the colors you want, gently lift off the stencil and admire your awesome work. 

* Then dunk the pants into some water to make sure the bleaching process stops for reals.

This is tactical stupidy, if true. Any political scientist worth their salt knows that immigration is a notoriously fickle issue, and adopting any staunch view on it in a run up to a real election is bound to lead to disappointment or surprise. Just ask Michael Howard in 2005.

Furthermore, I do not believe that the general public are in favour of a more right-wing 'free market' capitalism.

true,judgewooden,eng-GreaterLondon,The Dutch,"Labor wants to have an investigation in banking cultures, the Torries want to have an investigation to see if this is an issolated case, no. 10 wants to avoid an inquiry and Vince Cable things this sector is a massive cesspit. The Sunday papers suspect that bankers are cheats and that this is more wide spread. 

I think that with the number of scandals in the past three years, there is a far bigger problem.  Bankers and Politicians are in this together, there is a status quo that needs to be maintained. On the one side we are kicking the can down the road in terms of overall debt and on the other side we are savings banks that are to big to fail.

Since the current system is not sustainable it has to change. We however have no clue how to change that, in-fact there has been 17 EU summits to review this issue since 2009 and never an outcome other than extending-debt. As the politicians are developing a framework with voters on how we will change a couple of things are already reaching the top 'issues' list of the political debate and banking is one of them:

Example of things that are part of the political debate:

* We have to pay off our debtors soon.
* China will be the next world power.
* A country exit strategy has to be developed for the EURO.
* We really really want to avoid war.
* The internet is a place where criminals operate.
* The media reform is required.
* Cheap energy is not going to be available for ever.
* etc. etc.

Two things are added to that debate:

* Banking sector needs to be reformed (Glass-Steagall'ish).
* Perhaps London is not the best place to have global banks.

The UK biggest income is its banking &amp; insurance sector and they can not afford to loose it. This is the first real serious FSA fine since its creation. What is interesting about this case is that it was done in conjuction with the USA authorities. So there are serious questions being raised about the competency of UK to manage bankers while British bankers are being given a free ride on our debt.

So to answer your question: **When there is going to be change, nobody will have sympathy for British bankers and might even consider moving the global banking capital out of UK.**

Yes (assuming we don't have a command economy or a gift economy), we need one.  Yes, it should be efficient, so that the rest of the economy gets the capital distributed sensibly.

But after a certain point of efficiency, there are diminishing returns to the real economy, and profits made there are extractive and/or illusory based on bubbles.

We need a stock exchange so that private investors can cash out by flotation, and so companies can raise capital by providing shares. That's the reason many of us tolerate it existing.  Abstractions like derivatives and options do not necessarily enhance its ability to do that, and add massive complexity.  They provide a benefit for those playing the game and not for society at large.

Thankyou not olny to you to all the people who replied

&gt;Rafa's 'perfect' pressing machine took several seasons to build

Yes but it suited Liverpool,we dominated teams,even beat Barcelona in their home ground

&gt;Rodgers' team 'rest' by just circulating the ball around
&gt;until they see an opening or opportunity to attack,
&gt;at which point they play with a higher tempo

Is that similar to Barcelona?

&gt;AVB using a higher defensive line, or being more attacking, etc

Does Rodgers prefer that too?
because Liverpool played well when they used high line &amp; pressing game
Also just read that Rodgers &amp; AVB are Students of Jose(was so happy)

&gt;AVB seems to be the least tactically flexible (so far)

Hope that's true, just read he is off to Spurs

&gt;Rodgers' suggests he might do things differently.

Glad to hear that

&gt;All in all, I'd say we have one of the best youth teams in England

Woo Hooo that's what worried me most
whether we can reproduce players like Gerrard &amp; Carragher.
Heard that FSG made a lot of investment in youth system is that true?

Also what concerns me is if we chose the right man or if AVB was the man?
what do you guys think
Jose was the master of both
but recently read BR had his views which he shared with Jose
and He liked them
where as AVB did the tactical analysis of other teams for Jose

First half of paragraph is true and outlines Adam Smith's invisible hand. Second half is propaganda and only actually applies when the system is working well. Firstly, many people can't simply move to another company. NonComp contracts are common in many areas that prohibit you from working for an employer in the same field within a set period of time of starting with a firm. Similar provision is made when you enter into a service with many companies. I want to leave BT? I need to wait until the contract is finished. These checks and balances also do not apply freely. It works on paper, but in the real world there are often far more limitations on simply 'up sticks and move'. If you want to go to a different job you may need to move. If you have a family that's not a decision that you can just take. You may have other responsibilities tied to the area too, dependent relatives or just plain old social investment and attachment.

Then there's what happens when the employment terms are just crap everywhere (which they usually are). Back in the homeland a salary of 13,000 a year was actually very good for the area. Oh, and that was for a private company who took on outsourced NHS Pensions and payroll. But they were just exploiting a niché as is the way of capitalism rather than being accessories to mugging I'm sure. Where do you go? What do you do? There is no choice. The working conditions were also crap largely thanks to the company driving up profits by doing all that they could to cut costs. And they still could not provide a decent service. In fact I've yet to see pension records from any private company that could. I've administered over 20 different trusts and the ones that kept their service in house typically had the best kept records. There were some stinkers in there too, but you could at least expect good data from them. When taking on a trust that has been kept privately you know the record is going to be fucked.

The reason for this is quite simple. Trusts only outsource if it will save them money. In order to make money therefore, a private company needs to charge less than what the trust would pay doing it themselves, and reduce running costs even below that to make a profit. The end result is a badly run, undermanned businesses that provided an atrocious service. Oh and of course trusts couldn't just bounce back to another provider because- shock and horror- it was a fixed term contract. By the time the contract was up the damage had been done, including massive overpayments to various staff. Checks and balances insufficient to prevent the trust's payroll being completely screwed. As for their pension records we did the best we could but there was just too few people for too much work.

&gt;You're blaming the private sector for the incompetence of the HMRC...

Yes, the HMRC should certainly not have rolled over and let it pass. However that doesn't change the fact these businesses decided they were going to break the law and refuse to pay their taxes. You've failed to address the actual criticism- private firm refuses to pay tax.


The second part of that paragraph baffles me. Firstly there is no monopoly on healthcare or security. There are many private hospitals and practices. There are many private security firms (including ones providing security at the Olympics). Justice? Well, I'm assuming police comes under that and not security. Lawyers and solicitors I'm guess don't count in that either as they are usually private. 

First of all justice requires law and rules. Who makes them? Justice also needs to apply equally to all people and entities (something private firms have expertly managed to dodge by the way, see above). So what body decides these laws and ensures as fair and impartial trial as possible? A private firm? A firm driven solely by the need to make money? I can't see that ending well. We may have corruption now but at least it's not an expected part of the system. Letting companis write their own laws is like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. And even then, which firm drafts law? Which firm enforces it? What happens when there is a conflict of interest? Even in businesses insider trading happens and people use privileged knowledge from one position to get a leg up in another role. How does that transfer to justice? Again with the police. Who decides what laws they enforce? They already victimize certain groups of people certainly, but all you're doing is swapping them bashing black youth for bashing people with the wrong corporate ID card. 

Finally with regard to your 'invoice for voluntary service', this means everything must be paid for. Everything. You want to use that road? Your road tax doesn't cover it so you can buy a subscription. What's that? It costs too much or the road service is too poor? Use a different road. Eh? The only other road adds 1 hours onto an hour's commute and is no cheaper? Not my problem.

It's the ultimate expression of free market economics and ultimately it fails just as badly as a purely centrally planned economy. The internal checks of Adam Smith's hand just don't hold up in real life. Especially nowadays when there's more profit to be had in back alley deals, tax avoidance, accounting chicanery, exploiting employees and suing the competition (smartphone patent wars are a good example of this) than there is in actually providing the best service. Government is required to provide checks and balances that can actually be applied (however badly)

&gt;Laws are much easier to avoid when you're the people making them. The government is currently engaged in a decade long illegal war, that has resulted in approximately half a million civilian Iraqi deaths (all at tax-payers expense, I might add),

True in spirit, but flawed in fact. First the Iraq war is over as far as Britain is concerned. We pulled out over two years ago (closer to three), and were there for six years. Certainly not a 'decade'. I'm not sure if you're being hyperbolic or just inaccurate, but it doesn't help your case. How do you reconcile 

&gt;Laws are much easier to avoid when you're the people making them. 

with the complaint about the government's monopoly on justice? Are you not just taking the problem from one organization and giving it to another to exploit? One that gets far more out of the exploitation directly? The Iraq war may have been illegal but it's beneficence to the government is questionable at best. War's beneficence to the private sector though is historically massive. And while we're on the subject how does an army fit in to your ultimate free market ideal? I'm guessing Tom Clancy style PMCs, but if someone threatens the British isles how are they deployed? Who hires them? Who gives them the money to pay soldier's wages? Do civilians need to organize a national level fundraiser? Or do they bill us after the threat is over? sounds like taxation to me. And again, you've avoided the actual point of criticism and instead decided to try and shift focus on to another area's shortcomings.

&gt;and you're worried about fiddling interest rates and biased reporting?

And you're worried about money being paid to people that provide the country with a health service? 

&gt;And the government, who foolishly invest their ill-gotten gains in terrible investments, time and time again, who subsidise bad loans, and bail out bad and ineffective businesses based purely on the fact that it'll win votes, are completely good and innocent and fine.

Did I ever say the government was innocent? I don't believe so. You see here's the thing. I don't deal in absolutes. Well, not mostly anyway. I don't think private business is necessarily evil or inefficient. Every single private firm I have worked for bar one has been, but I'm prepared to accept on the basis of that one exception that most of the firms I've worked for were just exploiting the atrocious job market in Wales. Like wise I have no desire to live in a Stalinist state and I am aware that history shows a purely centrally planned economy just leads to a surplus of bricks and no food. However government and industry support each others failings. government (in theory) stops private businesses from just making their own rulebook at the detriment of anyone not near the top of the company. I've seen this happen at the outsourcing company I mentioned. The checks inherent in capitalism are just not sufficient when you apply them to the real world. But the government as you said makes it decisions based on far more factors than pragmatism and what is beneficent to the people. Private business generates wealth to offset those bad choices. See how it goes?

I don't particularly like the bail out, but I can understand why it was done. The collapse of those institutions would have been extremely problematic. Yes it would have ensured that the businesses that rose to take their pace would be less reckless in the glorious Darwinist capitalism way of things, but the problems cause in the mean time would screw over the entire nation. It does however highlight my point as to what happens when a business can operate without sufficient oversight, especially when it's 'too big to fail'. My concern is that it will happen again in about 50 years unless the government actually does something to stop it. Again, the play between the two. If the banks can't regulate themselves then the government will intervene.

Bottom line is I can sleep well at night because my shorts are just as dirty as yours.

The 'rich' and 'poor' tags cloud the issue and as a generalisation (I stress *generalisation*) they might as well be classed as coming from 'interested' and 'non-interested' families. I'm certainly not saying all parents of children from 'poor' backgrounds don't care about their children's education, but the amount of time and effort they put in to helping their kids achieve is generally (from my experience) a lot less. I'll explain with two main points... 

* Family sizes are generally much larger in poorer families meaning there is less time for parents to spend helping individual kids with school work. I don't know whether families have many kids because they are poor (and can get more benefits) or families are poorer because they have had loads of kids. Kids are expensive! Either way, there's less time for individual kids.

* 'Richer' families generally have one or two parents who go out and work hard. Why do they work hard? Because they want the best for their family. Having that good work ethic means they put more time in to helping their children, working hard with them in the evenings, reading to their children at night, helping with hmwk, calling teachers after work, attending workshops to learn how to support their kids (Most primary schools offer this), attending parents evenings etc. Again I understand this is a generalisation as there are certainly people from poorer backgrounds who work bloody hard to give their children the best they can but this is what I see day in, day out. 


**tldr; It's not all about rich parents being better educated and passing that knowledge down. It's working hard with your own kids and the mount of individual support you can give them at home.**

This is not what the article is about.

If you compare two averages those averages have to be comparable.  If the average public sector nurse salary is higher than the average Asda shelf stacker can you conclude from this that the nurses are overpaid?

If you compare the average salary of nurses combined with policemen and civil servants against the Asda shelf stacker plus estate agents plus car mechanics, does the comparison now tell you which group is better reimbursed for the time, education, risk, energy and stress that their job entails? 

At what point of adding jobs to the two groups do they become comparable?

What pisses me off about these comparisons so much is that it's an expansion of what I consider Daily Mail math.  You give too numbers, say the word 'average' and the ignorant reader can take it as fact that one group represented by one number is the bad guys and the other group is the underdog good guys.  They've used numbers so it must be correct!  Is disgustingly misleading and underhanded.  The Guardian article does a marginally better job of quantifying the figures but as usual many people just read they bits that feed their self-righteous anger, ignoring the rest.

The statement made was that ""Public Sector better paid than their Private **equivalent.**"" And I would like examples of this.  I keep seeing this claim made in these stupid Public v Private arguments but never see it backed up.

I don't doubt that there are some jobs in the public sector that are individually comparable to an equivalent job in the private sector.  And those public sector workers are better compensated, either through higher wages, pension or other perks.  Just like I know there are private sectors jobs that are better compensated that public sector equivalents.

He's a great coach in his own right for sure but defensive play was not our strength in his time, we were a great attacking team with Fernando freaking Torres in his prime playing for us but he was happy to sit back with a 1-0 scoreline and let the clock run down the time. If the other team equalised, we were doomed to a draw. It really annoyed me when this started happening with KD as well but that was more the teams fault than his, they just stopped pressing for the ball once we went a goal up and it lead to some very irksome results. I can't wait to see what BR can do, but if his records says anything, its that he will try to bring back the Liverpool way once again.

true,UncleArthur,sussex,East Grinstead,"One issue the banks have is the need to meet the European Capital Requirement Directive. The 'Basel 2' agreement said that banks have to hold back 8% of their risk-weighted assets in 'own funds', and this can cause issues.

What are 'risk-weighted' assets? Well, imagine you have a bank with the following assets:

- £100m of government debt (Gilts)
- £100m of secured lending (mortgages)
- £100m of unsecured lending (overdrafts, etc.)

The risk-weightings on these three different types of assets are 20%, 50% and 100% respectively. So the bank's total risk-weighted assets are:

- £100m x 20% = £20m
- £100m x 50% = £50m
- £100m x 100% = £100m

Total = £170m. Under the European Capital Requirement Directive, this bank has to hold back 8% of £170m, in other words £13.6m, in either shareholder capital or retained profit. This is where the problem comes in, especially when we are dealing in billions, not millions.

Imagine that a bank wants to increase its unsecured lending to small businesses, as the government has asked it to do. For every extra £100m it lends, it will ALSO have to find another £8m of profits to put aside, or raise another £8m from its shareholders, to meet the Basel 2 rules. As you can imagine, shareholders are reluctant to give yet more capital to the banks; and putting extra profit to one side means that it cannot be lent or invested, so it won't earn a return. So there's a dichotomy.

I have no sympathy for the investment bankers and their huge profits but I have a small measure of sympathy for the commercial bankers who may want to lend more money but have to meet the capital requirement directives at the same time.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"The 2008 scheme is comparable to the 1995 section in terms of benefits at retirement, but the retirement dates are all 5 years later and there's no automatic tax free lump sum. However the base line pension is much higher (based on 1/60th of salary instead of 1/80th salary), and you can 'sell' yearly pension to get a tax free lump sum. Selling enough pension to get an equivalent lump sum to the 1995 scheme leaves you with roughly the same yearly pension.

To me it seems fair but I would still advise against going into it over the 1995 scheme (the choices exercise will be re run in the next few years) as the 1995 scheme has a lower retirement age. You can work past that age if you want.

The contribution rates are actually reviewed each year. the current rates are 5%, 6.5% 8% 8.9% 9.9% and 10.9%. These are the same regardless of which section of the scheme you are in. The one you contribute depends on your pensionable earnings for the financial year. The earnings level assigned to each rate is actually reviewed year by year anyway. I believe what is still being discussed is the idea of adding or changing the percentage amounts. the 8, 8.9, 9.9 and 10.9 rates are new replacing 7.5 and 8.5 rates. These could be changed further down the line, hopefully with negotiations with the unions.

If you have years accumulated under different sections of the scheme they are paid out as separately calculated pensions. So for example if you have 3 years in the 1995 section and 20 in the 2015 section, we calculate your entitlement as 3 years at 1/80 of final salary with a lump sum, plus 20 years at 1/57 of career average salary with no automatic lump sum.

Err, the hype totally defines the volume of sales in the music marketing world.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"When the 2008 scheme was rolled out people who had 1995 membership had the option of joining it if they wanted to and moving in their membership. Anyone joining after April 2008 though has no choice in the matter- they go into the 2008 section.

After 2015 everyone will be put into the 2015 scheme, no decision, no choice. If you're a new starter then you have only 2015 membership. If you have membership from other schemes you essentially stop accumulating years in them and start accumulating years under the terms of the 2015 scheme. I'm not yet sure if people will be given the option to move their years into the 2015 section if they want (which could be beneficial to some), but I'd be surprised if the option wasn't on the table.

So essentially yes, you are correct. After 2015 it's 2015 terms or bust. But you will still be able to keep the years you accumulated under the other sections (assuming you have some).

It's also worth noting that there is some transitional protection. If you have within ten years of your normal retirement age for the scheme into which you are currently paying (60 for 1995 or 55 if you have Special classes, 65 for 2008)  on 01/04/2012, then you are *not* required to move. You can keep paying into your current scheme section. If you are within 13.5 years of normal retirement age but more than 10 years away then you are permitted to pay into your chosen scheme for a few years longer before being forced to move. For every month you are over that 10 year mark, take 2 months off 10 years. That final figure is how long you can carry on paying into your chosen scheme for after the 2015 terms hit home (I'll double check that formula tomorrow).",0,1341143564,null,0,false,0,c57zq6c,t3_vv0my,t1_c57zq6c,t1_c57znd4,null,1429271589,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

An explanation I've heard, that I must admit makes sense, is that for the nominal fee he would cost (a few million), the added 'star power' and his experience, Maicon could be the solution for a couple of years as the younger players get better.

To me that only seems possible if you have some damn good systems in place which help every part of society to achieve.

But ultimately it not helpful, and the real work, figuring out how to actually fix the problems with the finance sector is god damn hard.

Yes, the sector needs reform, but that reform needs to be done in a way which still allows our finance sector to remain strong.

Basically though it's hard to call. The doctors are the ones who are getting really screwed by this so it's understandable that they are upset. for other people... well it's understandable that people paying more will be irritated. The big problem is that it's gone about as far as 'they expect you to pay more for less' and suddenly people are up in arms. Many people (the lowest earners) will not have to pay any more, and even above that people can still be better off than either the 2008 or 1995 sections thanks to a better accrual rate. You hit your maximum salary quite early in your career, so the average is not that much lower than the final.

We've also had some firebrands stirring shit up too, getting people all riled and ready to strike even though they are the ones that will likely *benefit* from the changes.

I suppose the consensus would be that there is certainly reason to be upset for many people, but there's a little too much ignorance as to what the changes actually mean for comfort, so many people are getting agitated unnecessarily.

On a final note, assuming you're a NHS employee contact your pension team and ask for an estimate and a copy of your membership history every 5 years or so. They should check your record before sending these things out so if there are any errors it will get them resolved before they've lingered for too long.

There is a dance tune called Papua New Guinea, by FSOL (it stands for Future Sound Of London). 
 
This is not considered an obscure dance tune only known to ravers. It entered the UK charts twice, in 1992 and 2001 where it was in the top 30. It received airplay, and has been featured in a top selling Playsation game. It also featured on many compilation CDs in Britain in the 90s. 
 
Considering her age and the fact she's from London, surrounded by the rave culture in her years (remember the rave poster in the episode she saw her dad die?), ~~she~~ **Rose** would know it. 
 
The tune has a very distinctive beginning sound and drum beat. If it were to be played suddenly and for no reason, even the first few seconds of it, it would surprise people. 
 
How would an electronic piece of music slip in like that? Well: fellow electronic act Underworld are the musical directors for the London 2012 Olympics.

Some BIOS will, or used to, flash from CD or USB - it's often not documented anywhere.

true,highd,tennant,Tennant,"I just found it a bit hard to believe that the Dr. would want all this domestic drama. I mean Amy as a companion on her own isn't that interesting, she is another white, attractive girl with backstory, but that is pretty much her in a nut shell. She needed Rory and River to make her as important as she was.

I also think that Moffat made it way to much a soap opera. Sure exploring the Dr's emotional landscape is important, but not as important as the countless people in the universes that could have used his help, while he was taking care of the family. To me it was a horrible waste of episodes so much attention given to 3 people.

The point of the Dr. is to help people. It's to come into ordinary people's lives who have extraordinary problems and help them. It's about ""everybody lives, Rose"" or the Slavine that got the second chance or the geeky chubby kid that got credit for blowing up his school. 

The show isn't about that anymore. It's about the Days of Our Dr. His home life and the time dedicated to his family and I don't really dislike that but think they could have tempered the story with more episodes about helping others. 

I think I would have felt 100% different about this if they would have gone with the little girl Pond instead of the adult companion. To watch this story from that pov would made sense to me because he would have watched her grow up and have a real emotional investment in her. His love for her, Rory and River would have made sense to me. It would have been part of his fabric and you couldn't deny it. However it's very hard for me to believe that the Dr. went from not being able to vocalize his being in love with Rose, to this openly happy, family man, let's be domestic Dr. in such a short period of time.

Also as strongly as 9 felt about getting domestic, it doesn't really make a lot of sense. 

Oh well I still love the show, I just don't feel the emotional ties that others do to this group of companions. Things that should have made me cry didn't move me, and it just seems a bit over the top.

Is it cynical for me to see these inquries as a slap on the wrist for the people they focus upon?

And I don't see how he'd be a Modric replacement. He's best as a player off the striker and if AVB comes in we won't really have that role on the field which is just another reason why I'm surprised we're even linked with the player.

He CAN play in a 4-3-3 and he's done so for Swansea against bigger clubs. A lot of the time they would play more of a 4-2-3-1 with the ball but without it it was more of a 4-5-1 with Gylfi on the right side of a midfield 3 and the wide men very deep. 

So he is capable of playing deeper and I think he works hard enough, but his skill set is not really close to Modric. He might replace him in the team, but he wouldn't play in the same way. 

And the longer this plays out, the more I'm convinced he's going to Liverpool. The radio interview with his father, if we're to believe it, suggested he hadn't decided yet, which is a big contradiction to what else has been said. To me if you're still in it, he's yours. 

Personally I'd rather see us man up and splurge on Oscar from Internacional. We have ties to that club and we could probably make it happen for ~18m or something. He will be world class some day and his attributes will make him a very good future replacement for Modric's role.

Of course direct copying took place. This guy heard the song on the radio/online, copied it and released it. How can you possibly say he hasn't copied it? 

&gt;What about if I go to a restaurant and copy their meals?

If the meal was a specific creation of that restaurant, then no.

&gt;Or I sell copies of original art pieces (clearly marked as copies)?

As long as the original rights holder has given permission or rights have passed into public domain. Also, he isn't clearly marking these tracks as covers. Nowhere in the title of his releases does it state that these are covers.

When people release covers or sample a song, they are required to get permission, otherwise the rights holder can sue them into the sun. See Bittersweet Symphony as an example.

Secondly, most economists, when making predictions, won't give definite answers since they know that's stupid.  You'll get charts with statistical errors, and averages, because that is the nature of economics.  It is first and foremost a statistical science.

And, frankly, I have no idea how you can just arbitrarily state how 'predictive' one science is verses another, let alone how such a measure determines the validity of a science.  I mean, weathermen get stuff wrong all the time, it's not like meteorology is a bunk science.

You smoke one, then another one, and eventually they kill you. The only reason you want to continue smoking is because you already smoke. Smoking cigarettes is not a rational thing to do, so no rational-thinking adult will choose to do it. 

Feel free to carry on smoking, that's your (non-rational choice), but don't pretend you do so because you're a free-thinking badass who won't obey the system with your ""fuck off, I'll smoke if I want to""; the only reason you continue to smoke is because you can't be bothered to quit.

We live in a democracy. Our elected officials, our laws and our facilities are supposed to be a reflection of the needs and desires of society; the preferences of the people who live in our country. There are obvious and stereotypically British things that large sections of society express a preference for, maybe it's a Sunday lunch or pint of beer, but specifics can be picked apart so let's keep it abstract for now and say that when preferences exist in large enough numbers they are catered for from the resources and space available.

Mass immigration alters the population and skews these average preferences, which move away from that of the average British person. So on average people lose out in small ways that make being a British person in Britain worse than it was before 4 million people showed up who have different desires.

People don't see it abstractly though, when someone's area becomes filled with shit that they don't want or need they tend to bitch about the immigrant population which that shit caters for. Maybe you can rightly call them racists or xenophobic for this, but there's no escaping the fact that the place has changed for their loss and it's directly because of the population change.

Immigration should be done slowly over many generations so we get the cultural benefits without the associated losses, not in a great big fucking free-for-all.

The fact is however, that takeovers of are expensive, and rail companies are now huge entities, and you can't force Virgin Rail or others to sell. You can't just commandeer the business and it's assets. 

The Government agreeing with EVERY rail company nationwide to take them over at an agreed price with EVERY rail company is an expensive endeavour. Which is the only point I'm making. Re-nationalisation isn't simple and it isn't cheap.

Handover is NOT built into the contract however. T&amp;C of business and oversight/regulatory arrangements are, but the government didn't negotiate the ability to commandeer the business should a future government want to renationalise. Such clauses would likely be challenged in Court anyway. Virgin Rail and national express for example wouldn't plough plough millions upon millions into a rail network with a rug pulling clause.

&gt; Section 1 creates a general offence of fraud and introduces three ways of committing it set out in Sections 2, 3 and 4. 

&gt;  -   Fraud by false representation (Section 2); 
&gt;     ...

&gt; In each case: 

&gt;   -  the defendant's conduct must be dishonest; 
&gt;   -  his/her intention must be to make a gain; or cause a loss or the risk of a loss to another. 
&gt;   -  No gain or loss needs actually to have been made. 
&gt;   -  The maximum sentence is 10 years' imprisonment.

&gt; Fraud by false representation (Section 2)

&gt; The defendant: 

&gt;   -  made a false representation 
&gt;   -  dishonestly 
&gt;   -  knowing that the representation was or might be untrue or misleading 
&gt;   -  with intent to make a gain for himself or another, to cause loss to another or to expose another to risk of loss.

When the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo he prevented France from dominating Europe and gave the continent a period of peace never before experienced. Trade flourished. Economies boomed. He was also Prime minister of Great Britain.

* Who wrote ""I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow, And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe...""?

* Which century did Dickens write in?

* ""Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean."" These lines come from which play?

* Which historical figure temporarily abolished the monarchy, and for five years in the 17th century ruled as Lord Protector over an English republic?

sneaky edit/addition:

Personally I've seen very little criticism of the national anthem and have only seen it mentioned recently in correspondence to the National Secular Society. Does it get mentioned around here very often?

But in any case, I think it's indicative of a quite important issue. Various things that mention Yahweh, or Jesus, or Christianity are used in kind of circular reasoning to justify each-other: ""We're a Christian country! Look we sing about 'God' in the national anthem!"" ""Look we have religious services at national memorials!"" ""Look we have clergymen doing xyz in parliament - religion is important to us all!""

For myself, and a good many others, I think it's important to make some noise around the (minority - or getting there) religious people who think it's important for us all to acknowledge their religion. Thus far, no further, kinda thing.

I didn't make any kind of value judgement about the needs and desires of one group of people over another, my argument actually relies on equality for everyone living here. Assuming you're Reddit's usual demographic you, like me, have grown up with Indian and Chinese food being traditional British meals, you'll get no complaints from me about that.

My point was that mass immigration changes places, and that's not usually an immediate benefit to the people living there unless it's rich people setting up holiday homes and spending all their money here. Having said that plenty of Spanish hate us for invading their lands and doing just that.

&gt; is it not better to be a culturally rich island than a rancid conservative backwater

I'm honestly not sure. If we could measure changes in the wealth, quality of life and happiness of British nationals compared to immigrants in, say, 25 years time, then maybe I would be. When the results of that study come in I'll have a strong opinion, but until then I'll err on the side of controlled immigration because that upsets the least amount of my neighbours.",0,1341195069,null,0,false,0,c588yp0,t3_vvdnm,t1_c588yp0,t1_c588gte,null,1429275949,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If none of The Doctors appeal to you, then at least you gave it your best shot.

On a personal level, though, I can't get enough of Doctor Who. I grew up watching random episodes on TV(The only way to watch it in America), and to this day I could watch any Doctor from 1-8. I don't understand why people could like the new Doctor Who, but have such disdain for the classic series. Although, in my opinion, the best I can think of was that the RTD era was such a departure from the classic series, focusing on the relationships between The Doctor and his companions, and having a much more soap opera feel to it. We got a lot more of The Doctor hanging around London so Rose could visit her mom, or having The Daleks take over the Earth.

So you would sit down to watch an episode, and it would end on a cliffhanger and you'd find out what happened to The Doctor the next week. Each of these series of episodes had some kind of title, like The Unearthly Child or The Pirate Planet.

So each set would be about the length of a movie, but that's just how they aired the episodes.

If it's still a bit confusing, just think of each episode as being about 2-3 hours long, but broken into 6 episodes that are roughly half an hour long. If you've ever seen it, the old Adam West Batman would do the same thing, but spanning only two episodes.

And the great thing with the series is exactly what I described, you can pick up from just about any point in the series. Unlike with the Tennant or Moffat eras. You don't need to start at the beginning of an era, or even the entire series, to understand what's going on.

With that in mind, if you want to understand more about Time Lord society, then you should really post on the subreddit asking which episodes you should watch. Off the top of my head, Genesis of the Daleks, The Deadly Assassin, and Trial of a Time Lord are all worth watching to understand Time Lord society/the conflict between Time Lords and Daleks. And, as I said, you can watch these independent of anything else without any consequences.

For more, you should really check out /r/gallifrey. It's a great subreddit that is all about discussion of Doctor Who, with no image/meme posts.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Here's my thoughts on it, at least something I wish they had expanded upon in the first place. I think, or would like to think, that we do in fact see The Doctor die the first time around. However, by Amy/Rory/River seeing his own death, he becomes complacent with his adventures, knowing he *can't* die until that fixed point.

This causes a major change in events, notably during The Wedding of River Song. Before the gang witnessed his death, it would cause him to be more cautious, not realizing his death was soon-to-be during a fixed point. So when River showed up trying to kill him, he wouldn't have allowed her to kiss him, knowing about her lipstick fetish. This would also ultimately mean that he never ran into the Tesserecta, and thus never had a viable means of escaping death.

Knowing of his death, thanks to Amy telling him, caused him to allow River to kiss him, thinking he couldn't die, anyway. This eventually leads to Amy/Rory running into the Tesserecta as it chases River, and The Doctor learning of its existence. He, obviously, later uses it to save his own life.

Of course, this is just my own head canon, as it is never really mentioned in the show. However, it makes the most amount of sense to me if we are to believe that we see The Doctor die the first time, and the Tesserecta die the second time.

The big gaping hole I fully admit in my own theory: there is no TARDIS the first time. This might seem small, but we find out during the season finale that the reason why there is no TARDIS is because it's inside the Tesserecta. If the first time truly is The Doctor, then where is the TARDIS?

Either way, I still like to think that The Doctor died at some point, even if it's not the time we saw. You have to remember, time is always in flux, and can be rewritten. There would most likely be a point in which The Doctor would have experienced these events without Amy/Rory/River having been there to witness it, ultimately tell him about his fate, and lead him to devise a plan that would save himself.

No you don't, the organisation already exists and this transfer takes place every time a franchise changes hands. Virgin don't open new offices and recruit hundreds of managers and staff when they win a franchise because the managers and staff ARE the franchise, Train Operating Companies own nothing and have no assets. The track and signalling belong to the government and the TOC buys 'Paths' to run trains on. the Rolling Stock is owned by Porterbrook/Angel or HSBC and the TOC lease them on long term deals that transfer with the franchise, the offices are rented and usually have been x'y'z railway offices for a hundred years they just change the name above the door. 

The government have 'taken over' several franchises in the last few years when companies overbid then couldn't meet their franchise agreement (East Coast in particular was a cluster fuck)

1. We desperately want our team to pull out of the mid-table mediocrity that we have had to endure for the past two seasons.

2. Idle hands are the devil's playground. There aren't any matches going on, not much news on the transfer front and the one player (Gylfi) that seemed close isn't instantly bowled over by the allure of Liverpool FC.

3. We are getting nervous. Many of us know that without Champions League football, we are falling further and further behind in the money that is required to sign the best players.

4. Manager turnover (Hodgson to Dalglish to Rodgers) is also a bit concerning. Players need to adapt to a new system, a new approach, a new philosophy, etc. Simply put, a new boss at your workplace.

All those factors (and others I'm sure) is making Liverpool supporters a bit nervous.

Frankly, I don't know if we're going to make the quote-unquote big time transfer that we ""deserve"" (though, I hope we can).

The Tesselecta had to die. And when River didn't shoot the Tesselecta (who she thought was the Doctor at the time) the universe blew up. Then she fixed things back up by shooting the Tesselecta.

From what we've seen of fixed points in the New Who, it seems like the *effects* of the event are more important than what causes them. In The Waters of Mars we see The Doctor circumventing a fixed point(Bringing the captain back to Earth, saving her life), but there are no immediate negative repercussions for doing so. I think this is because she, herself, fixes the fixed point when she goes back and kills herself, because it's more important that her death causes her grandaughter to explore space, not specifically that she dies on Mars.

Same thing here. The important issue wasn't The Doctor dying, but the Doctor being perceived as dead, and having the effects as such trickle throughout time and space. It's the effects of him dying that need to preserved, more than just him dying. Thus why he's able to use the Tesselecta instead of himself, and effectively fake his own death.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Still, is that supposed to be an excuse for rioting?

The trigger was Mark Duggan's death; the explanation was how bad things have become generally in our country for poor, marginalised (especially young) people and how frustrated they have become over being forced to pay for the fuck ups and frauds of a small privileged elite, who are laughing in their faces and enriching themselves further everyday using a system which is broken, corrupt, unresponsive to democratic change, unresponsive to non-violent opposition, and increasingly clamping down on legitimate protest, criminalising dissent, etc. etc.  Rioting, as Martin Luther King said, is ""the language of the unheard"".

&gt;How are the bankers, politicians and their friends affected by young people rioting and breaking into the store front's of working class people?

There was little grand political vision behind much of what happened I don't doubt.  Once the fires had metaphorically and physically been lit, people involved were following their own lights, and some people's lights don't burn very brightly - their targeting was well off.  On the other hand, working class people don't own corporate chains, they're merely enslaved by them.  For most franchises a person needs a minimum net worth of several million dollars, and usually has to commit to opening up a minimum number of stores in a given area over a given time.

As for how such attacks on capitalist businesses affect the bankers, politicians and their friends, well they make them sleep a little less securely in their beds and a little bit more likely to negotiate a fairer deal.  They also demonstrate to working people that the system isn't untouchable.  Do you think a conservative Democrat would/could have negotiated the New Deal with the bankers, corporate executives and wealthy individuals in the US at the height of the depression when there was ""no money"" without the threat of organised working people (socialists, communists, anarchists and the like) pushing for and credibly threatening an end to capitalism?  Do you think he would/could have convinced the rich to pay taxes at 97% and for corporations to carry their share of the burden too?  Do you think he could have created 12 million jobs that were needed that the private sector refused to or was incapable of doing?  Of course, it's all been unpicked and undone since then in the US, and in the UK too, which is why we need to be pushing back much harder than we are instead of bending over and taking the shit we're being fed because there is no organised resistance.

&gt;rioting is one step from anarchy.

Lot of companies borrow money all the time, and this is then used to fund the business and usually that loan is tied into signing up to longer term contracts (e.g. buying plant) with other people that cannot be undone should the bank pull out. One of the things this does it give the bank control, in effect ownership of the business as they can call in that loan and send you under or they can take the company.

Now, the important part is that this nuclear option wasn't typically used and businesses of all sides replied on the banks to be moral (yes, it is as crude as that) and to be happy to profit from the loan itself.

However what the bank can do if you have lots of assets is seize the firm and make even more money selling bits of it off (EMI and the Guy Hands case proving it happens to massive firms too).

Or in this case they say they will sieze the firm unless you sign up to this massive commission earning contract.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"My response to ""Unable go back down"" depends on *which* of Snowdon's tracks you are referring to. Because there's plenty of them and they've got a habit of crossing.

The easiest way up and down is proably using the Llanberris track which broadly matches the train track. It's quite long, but not very steep, is well marked and has no real tricky bits. If you get stuck on that (either ascending or descending), clearly you're out without Adult Supervision and should really stay at home and read a book instead. (The idiots in the article mentioned - out in Pyjamas - qualify under that description). There's no excusing idiotic behaviour but I'd have rated this track as do-able by anyone in suitable footwear and dressed with an appreciation of the conditions.

The Pyg and Miner's tracks starting from the visitor centre are also well marked and fairly easy; they stay off the ridges so exposure / sidewinds aren't really a problem. The final ascent could be tricky but it's a well made and marked track; the only problem descending is missing the Pyg turn and heading down to the lake, but since that takes you on a nice flat walk out the Miner's track it's not a problem. In really bad conditions I can see the short section where the track hits the ridge around to Snowdon Summit being unpleasant but it's easy to find shelter. So for appropriately-attired people I again get a little confused about ""unable to descend"" here.

If, on the other hand, it was folks attempting the Horseshoe and going up Crib Goch then really we're into unrealistic expectations. I've done that route a number of times but never in bad conditions, and I wouldn't. The ridge walk around from Crib to Snowdon is one of the best walks in good weather but it requires a degree of confidence and knowledge and appropriate equipment. I can easily see how people can get stuck on this route, but again it's a common sense thing of ""if you're not sure, you don't go"" especially if the weather's not playing nice.

In short: People can be idiots.

&gt; And I don't see what these particularly have to do with political protest.

It wasn't political protest, and no one has been able to show that it was. The few rioters who have consented to interview couldn't even articulate why they were rioting. The sole exception was a couple of girls from Croydon I heard, who got interviewed and said they were rioting because of ""The government and the banks and stuff"". A lot of them talked about the police killing a couple of weeks before. That is *not* political in the sense that you mean. 

Look, I think you're projecting your political views onto the rioters. You think that lots of stuff the current government has done 'deserves' riots because if goes against your set of values. So when a bunch of riots happen, bingo, it must be because they hate the same things you hate. It's a nice neat theory, but it's not actually been borne out by talking to the rioters themselves.

Whaa?  This has _nothing to do_ with the political views of the Guardian, why are you so _obsessed_ with the Guardian?  The Guardian is, broadly speaking, a pro-establishment paper in any event.  Sure, it does the hand-wringing liberal stuff, but ultimately it's down there in the foxhole with capitalism defending the system.

&gt;If you don't know why you're doing what you're doing, then you're just part of a mindless bit of group-think, you're not part of a political movement. 

Again, knowing why you're doing something - at a gut level - doesn't necessitate being able to articulate it on cue, on camera, to an unfriendly media.

&gt;So, if I nick a pair of Nikes out of Footlocker during the next set of riots, then I'm just a knob on the rob. But if someone from a council estate does it then it's a political commentary on the Class conflict? 

Will you?  Were all those Guardianistas you referred to?  Or do you all have a bit too much to lose?  Of course there was a lot of opportunism, no one is denying that, and several of those busted were exactly those kind of people - see an opportunity to acquire, acquire, because they don't expect to get caught.  Yet many of them did, and they were hammered for it, because the system couldn't let them be seen to get away with it.  Even though, acquisition at all costs is what corporate capitalism preaches.  At the other end of the class system, it's an everyday occurrence at a much vaster more damaging scale with almost literally zero chance of being caught and even less chance of ever being punished and basically no chance at all of being punished in proportion.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; Whaa? This has nothing to do with the political views of the Guardian, why are you so obsessed with the Guardian? 

Dude, you were the one who took my offhand reference and ran with it. I was just responding to you. As an aside, the Guardian was the only paper that came out and stated that the riots were political in nature. 

&gt; The Guardian is, broadly speaking, a pro-establishment paper in any event. Sure, it does the hand-wringing liberal stuff, but ultimately it's down there in the foxhole with capitalism defending the system.

That depends on what you mean by pro-establishment. Can a newspaper that wants a Republic in the UK, with plenty of socialist policies at a government level be considered ""pro-establishment""? Apparently, to an anarchist, it can. 

&gt; Again, knowing why you're doing something - at a gut level - doesn't necessitate being able to articulate it on cue, on camera, to an unfriendly media.

Or radio. Or in print. Why has every convicted rioter totally failed to articulate why they were rioting? Answer: it wasn't political. It was group-think, a mob mentality. People don't know why they do the things they do when they're in a mob. 

&gt; Will you? Were all those Guardianistas you referred to? Or do you all have a bit too much to lose?

*Now* I have too much to loose, yes. But when I was a teenager, that wasn't the case. I still wouldn't have done what they did. 

&gt; Of course there was a lot of opportunism, no one is denying that, and several of those busted were exactly those kind of people - see an opportunity to acquire, acquire, because they don't expect to get caught. Yet many of them did, and they were hammered for it, because the system couldn't let them be seen to get away with it. Even though, acquisition at all costs is what corporate capitalism preaches. At the other end of the class system, it's an everyday occurrence at a much vaster more damaging scale with almost literally zero change of being caught and even less chance of ever being punished and basically no chance at all of being punished in proportion. In fact, the system incentivises such behaviour and rewards it heavily.

I would argue that most political systems now are based on birthright - for without rich and supporting parents, it is incredibly difficult for anyone to rise to the highest office in any country.

However, even if that is factual - how does it affect the average person on their average day?

This is for me the fundamental issue with the argument. I don't intrinsically care which model we go for, although I am wary of having even more politics in an already politically heavy system...

...but if you want to overhaul the system I need practical benefits, not nebulous arguments about things that realistically don't affect people in their daily lives. Yes, it is theoretically impossible for the average person to marry into the monarchy and become King - but then again, it also would be theoretically impossible for the average person to be elected President or rise to the position of being nominated President.

Mr Average is never going to be Head of State under any system - save maybe a random lottery draw.

I propose that we treat money as information and transactions as a directed network; we thus target industries/businesses that best improve the rate of production. The logic of bank stimuli is that they, top down, feed the money into the system in order to prevent deflation (about the worst thing that can happen to an economic system). I think that this is less efficient than taking a ""bottom up"" approach as this is the way money feeds in a consumption driven society. You would be right to argue that it doesn't fix the underlying problems but it would be more an effective short term solution as it doesn't require banks to lend.

I expect this will be related to information entropy as we are trying to re-order the system so finding the right amount to put in will some ratio of the total amount of money in the ""wrong places"" i.e. savings as opposed to investments.

true,soothfast,eng-dorset,Dorset - Who's afear'd!,"Sigh.  You know I think a large part of it has something to do with (mainly) young men not having any male role models and who basically grow up feral without guidance and who get lured into gang culture as far more accessible than ""normal"" society ever could be to them (i.e getting an education and job).  There you go.  I have lived in london for 20 years.  I helped at an inner city primary schools.  I've dealt with boys dead behind the eyes by the age of 7 - lost already.  For want of a better phrase, there is a lack of morality. The ability to tell right from wrong or to empathise.  Its fucking sad. There is only so much government can do about issues like this IMO.  You can throw money at youth centres etc  and have some job schemes, but I think that just playing lip service to the real problem.  That is a breakdown in the family unit.  There are kids being brought up by a parent who were never properly brought up themselves, who rely on the state for housing and don't see education as important. Recipe for disaster.  If positives are to happen, they must come from within the community.
  
But for all I am aware of the issues, I still stand by what I think about the riots.  It was mindless violence for violence's sake. Excuse me if I don't weep for those that ruined the livelihood of people I care about.  People who I never thought would be on national news crying about what had happened in their ruins of their workplace.

At the end of the day, they are taxpayer funded and so they need to behave responsibly and work within budgets. If they can't, then bye bye. If we don't do this, then the alternative is completely uncontrolled spending.

I appreciate that it isn't that simple, and that closing a hospital might actually cost more in the long run if patients have to travel further, get sicker etc. But without that potential of closure, hospitals will only ever continue to spend more and more.

And I worked in the NHS for a year. I've seen how they manage money. It's horrifying. If you're given a budget you ALWAYS try to hit it, even if you don't need to. Coming in under budget is seen as bad because if you don't spend enough, your funding gets reduced, so occasionally we would go on a spending spree just to keep the spending up.

1) Businesses and individuals that participated in any transaction during this period have essentially been conned - and they will require an enormous amount of compensation, which will weaken the bank, and therefore our economy.

2) Confidence in one of the largest banks in the UK has been shattered, and this has a knock-on effect which results in a lack of confidence in ALL of our major banks. Again, this weakens our economy and threatens to deepen the current financial crisis.

3) Manipulating the libor was a direct attempt to make the bank look like it was more healthy than it really was - in a period where banks are struggling to stay afloat, we - the public, the bank account owners, the government, the *international* financial market, have been fooled into placing more trust and more cash into a bank that is lying about its health.

There are probably a vast number of knock-on effects that smarter men than I could tell you about - but essentially in answer to your question, the damage caused has been significant, and it's not over yet. If the government decide to have a full scale inquiry over this, it will be more bad publicity, more people will abandon their trust and remove their money from Barclays and the economic disaster that we're all squatting in will worsen.

2. This didn't seem to effect the RBS share price that dramatically compared to other events even though they are probably going to loose a lot of their customers. Now is probably the time to short sell :)

3. There is no excuse for this action. This means their software was not up to scratch. They should have had at least a backup plan and the ability to replay transactions from any point in time. Note: I work as a software dev. It is possible to do this on the scales.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; We certainly can't hope to understand the entire model - it's a chaotic system and is by definition impossible to understand. 

We can understand chaotic systems... quite well in fact; ""chaos"" does not mean not random or ""in no way can we hope to understand things"" it means some degree of hidden variability resulting in high sensitivity to tiny changes (i.e. uncertainty); with modern mathematics we're pretty good at quantifying uncertainty. We model some chaotic systems very accurately (gravitation, for example, in 3D dimensions with multiple objects, is entirely chaotic). By definition a model is never 100% accurate but it is always more accurate than if you don't model at all. The simplest model that fits your data is the best one.

You seem to be confusing chaos with randomness; they are not the same (in fact, this is a very popular misconception) a random network shows none of the properties of an economic/monetary one which actually tend to be small world, scale-free networks (which means that the number of links any given node or vertex has follows a power law distribution; in simple terms there are some incredibly densely populated hubs where messages have to pass through if they want to traverse the network) in a random network the linkage would be roughly uniform - this is clearly not the case with the markets. For example, the network of social interactions is a chaotic system, there is variability we can't hope to understand; yet you are no-more than 6 handshakes away from any person in the world; so if we want to send a message we just need to figure out who these ""hub"" people are (i.e Kevin Bacon). 

&gt; So why even try to control it when you know it's going to be wrong? 

There are degrees of wrongness. You can say that the universe is 14 Billion years old or you can say its six thousand; if you choose not to question you're further from the mark than if you, for example, used simple linear regression model of heat which would, in turn, be worse than a computational model based on our understanding of physical laws such as thermodynamics.

&gt; Why not let market forces direct capital to productive industries? Why not try...capitalism?

My interpretation that a market force is a response to some condition; i.e. the price of oil is affected by the relative cost of its production against the relative supply weighed in with healthy speculation about any future values of these (accurate modelling of this *chaotic* system will probably make you quite rich). The problem, at the moment, is that markets are not directing capital in a way that benefits growth; they don't know how, traders have one goal: profit.

I'm saying that we should simplify the model to encourage spending. Doing nothing (or not ""getting in the way"" as some people like to think of it), would probably create deflation, which, as I said before, is about the worst thing for an economy.

What state would that be then? A state where the working classes had a chance to own their own property?

A state where London gained prominence not as a trading centre but as a leading global finance centre?

A state where people could rise to senior positions in the business world without having to attend Eton or Harrow on the Hill?

I don't know how much you know about British history but those things are anything but a regression, and you're flat out wrong if you think she undermined *centuries* worth of socialist ""progress"". 

Despite whatever Lefty rag you've read says, she never touched the NHS and the so-called Organised Labour movement brought this nation to its knees during the '70s. On top of that socialism in this country goes back at most to the early 1900s, so I don't really know where you got the strange idea about 'centuries of socialist progress'...

&gt; Had she opposed the State in a genuine fashion whilst seeking to support working people, I'd have been a lot more sympathetic. But in fact, she expanded the State.

Why would she do that?

Ultimately a feudal or neo-feudal one, but thankfully she never got anywhere near that far.  Cameron seems to be making a better fist so far.

Having a mortgage doesn't mean you own your own property in any real sense, it just means you're a tenant who's far more likely to vote Tory and far less likely to become rebellious.

&gt;A state where people could rise to senior positions in the business world without having to attend Eton or Harrow on the Hill?

And how has the meritocracy worked out?  Shall we do a run-down of UK boardrooms, or universities, or politics, or professions, or just let's look at the top 1%, or we can play around with class mobility and find how Britain has pretty much the worst version of it in the developed world.

Just like the last Labour government is getting stuck for the global economic crisis (why not blame American Republicanism?), so, back then organised labour was somehow responsible for the [global oil crisis](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/03/1970s-oil-price-shock).  It didn't cause the Winter of Discontent exactly, but it led to it.

&gt;On top of that socialism in this country goes back at most to the early 1900s, so I don't really know where you got the strange idea about 'centuries of socialist progress'...

See now you're just being disingenuous.  I said ""progressive liberal and socialist movements over centuries"".  And, for the record, ""socialism"" goes back as far as the French Revolution at least, if you really want to comprehend the left (""left wing"" comes from back then too, referring to the seating arrangements in the French assembly).  The history of the left in Britain goes back to forerunners of anarchists I admire like [Winstanley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrard_Winstanley) in the 17th Century, [Godwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Godwin) in the 18th/19th, and [Thomas Hodgskin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hodgskin) around the same time - one of the utopian socialists who inspired Marx.  All of these writers and activists and the various movements which swirled round them, both more liberal and more revolutionary had a profound effect on British history, and if anyone is ignorant of it here, I fear it is you.

&gt;Why would she do that? What you've just described is small state socialism, which is a contradiction in terms, and says more about your sympathies than it does about Margaret Thatcher's domestic policies.

Because she was a Statist like all capitalists, she just hated the State wasting money on the poor.  In any event, she did expand the State, that's on record and I can easily prove it to you if I need to.

Edit: Grammar.

Edit edit:  On the Thatcherite expansion of the State - one could direct the same charge at Cameron in a preliminary fashion.  Thus far, for all the rhetoric about cutting the deficit and reducing the public sector ""burden"", shrinking the State etc., it's expanded so far under him too.  The truth is, they're not interested in getting rid of the State, they need it to defend privilege, they're only interested in redirecting its resources to ensure it enriches the right people.",0,1341249349,null,0,1341249912,0,c58hevy,t3_vvhxs,t1_c58hevy,t1_c58guqw,null,1429279995,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm at my girlfriend's place just down the road).

If it's sunny over the next couple of days, go check out Christ Church Gardens and of course the Botanic Gardens. You could also take a famous punt down the river. Just head down the high street out of town, you will shortly come to a bridge, down and to the left is the punt hire place.

If you want good eats, aside from the Magdalen Arms I mentioned earlier, the Cowley Road is a haven for multicultural grub. There must be about ten curry places, of which Aziz is the best. Red Star is a great Asian eating house, as is Lan Kwai Fong. Centrally there's the Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Fire and Stone (Pizza), Turl St. Kitchen and, of course, G&amp;D's. Also, Georgina's in the Covered Market is pretty good.

 You can also have a look around the other areas just out of Oxford city centre. These include Summertown, Jericho, and the Cowley Road, all short walks/bus rides away. Great stuff to be found everywhere.

...I would speculate that the issue is that you are buying a subsidised prepay phone and by paying cash there is no proof of identity on file.

The issue here is that criminals can ""break"" the box by unlocking the handset and selling it off at a profit and the network is unable to recover its subsidy.

The cash premium may be designed to deter such activities by making it less economic.

My partner and I were trying to hunt the torch down in Stratford and narrowly missed it so - figuring it would be travelling on foot - we headed by car for Warwick via a road other than the one the torch was going down... but as we got to the last roundabout before Warwick we *narrowly* made it in front of the police cavalcade escorting the torch by coach. We actually pulled over to take some shots and then fell in behind the torch again. 

Getting back to the security aspect... we followed the torch party *by car* through Warwick until finally as we got up towards the castle we heard some police talking and saying ""who are they? they're not with the procession"". Evidently we had ""lucked out"" ending up where we were and were and shortly after the road was closed ahead and we were asked to take a side turning and leave the area (they weren't rude, very professional job IMO). 

Point being - through no fault or intent of our own - we got mixed up in things purely because they *were* moving too fast to block everything off ahead and behind without really disrupting things.

I'm not sure I did, I was saying newspapers weren't really relevant.  But I'll leave that to others to judge.

&gt;Can a newspaper that wants a Republic in the UK, with plenty of socialist policies at a government level be considered ""pro-establishment""? Apparently, to an anarchist, it can. 

Well, yes, of course it can.  We're not in the middle-ages, capitalism isn't really concerned with defending the position of monarchs.  The US, the most capitalist nation on Earth (and, incidentally, just so we're clear here, also the nation with one of the most outsized States and military machines), doesn't have a royal family - it's a republic.  Royalty isn't essential to capitalism.  Indeed, it's almost irrelevant - she's just another rich person, with a few odd anachronistic powers (and obviously there's a bit more to it the UK State hides behind).

I see very few genuinely socialist policies coming out of the mouths of Guardian journalists, certainly not on the main site (a few maybe creep on to CiF).  Would you care to name a few?  The starting point for all socialism is worker ownership of the means of production, nothing to do with government nor benefits nor nationalisation nor deficits nor any of the  other distracting crap which fills most of the papers in a frenzied 'toing' and 'froing' of irrelevance.",0,1341257667,null,0,false,0,c58jj0y,t3_vvrm3,t1_c58jj0y,t1_c58efif,null,1429280993,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You used to be able to walk on land owned the two Trinity colleges combined (i.e. Oxford or Cambridge) between the two, apparently. This was *many* years ago before the area between was more built up. I'm afraid I can't cite my source, I read it a long time ago.

The other variation I think was that a student could request to take the exam while the proctor was in armour and sword. Really fuzzy on this.

You're splitting one story in two here: the story goes that a student requested cakes and ale as sustenance in his exam, pointing out to the proctor that there was University statue (which was written in Latin, but still valid) stating he could request it. At the end of the exam the proctor fined the student £5 for inappropriate dress to his exam because he was not carrying his sword to the exam.

There are SO many sorts of people at Kent, you don't have to make friends with people who are the stereotypical nymphomaniac alcoholic student just because they're the majority. 

PROTIP: Join societies. You'll meet people that share the same interests as you, and at the start they'll have a lot of socials (that DON'T involve clubs) where you can meet people. (I recommend the Drama society's 24-hour event at the start of the year, it will blow your mind.)

PROTIP 2: You're randomly mixed with people in Uni accomodation, so don't worry if you're not BFFs at the end of your first week. I got on with people in my flat during 1st year but I don't talk to any of them now. You'll have stuff in common with people on your course/society, because you've chosen the same shit, rather than having a computer randomly group you together.

We've finished the main story and want to wind down for a conclusion. As fun as this scene is, it prolongs the real ending where the Doctor realizes the true importance of Amy's wedding day.

Secondly, Amy flirts in it *a lot* and this harshs the pacing again. In the bedroom the Doctor is a bit taken aback by Amy's forwardness towards him. If we see three minutes of him dealing with her complaining about all the ladies in his life it makes it all the less funny and surprising. I mean, if he's flustered in this scene, it makes him getting flustered in the next scene seem much less interesting, or even downright repetitive.

I also don't think getting a loan and going to study nursing counts as benefits. If she's on more money on the loans than she was working and she's capable of getting into nursing school, then she's making a long term decision to change her life. I don't see it as claiming benefits, no matter how it's broken down and to say it's clearly cheating the system derides someone for wanting to make this decision. No sane person would quit their job and go to nursing school because their brother paid 40k in tax just because their brother told them to. She clearly wanted to and wasn't sure if she should.

My favorite moment of Doctor Who actually appears in the rebooted series (regarding the fact that I've only seen a couple 'Classic Who' episodes), but my Top 2 favorite scenes would have to be... 

**#1: The Tenth Doctor's Regeneration**

This, by far was the most emotional scene in all of Doctor Who, ever. The minutes before he regenerated; he visited all the people who helped him through his life. Then, as he walked away from Rose, he falls to the ground. While there, laying in agony, the Oods sing the Doctor's song. Absolutely beautiful at this point. Then the Doctor enters the TARDIS, and regenerates, with his final phrase, ""I don't want to go!"" 


**#2: The Doctor shows Vincent Van Gogh his work in 2010 A.D.**

After Vincent is shown pain and suffering during his greatest painting age, and is shown that nobody at his time even 'liked' even less than 'bought' his paintings; the Doctor decides to reveal to him what his work actually becomes. Vincent is put in front of his famous gallery in Paris, as he starts crying. He never even thought anyone liked his paintings. Even better, the Doctor asks the gallery manager what he thinks of Vincent's work. While the manager describes it to him, Vincent is closely listening. Vincent absolutely is crushed by this, tears of joy fall down as the man describes his work as ""stunning, and a beautiful blend of color."" It tells the world that pain and suffering only happens in life. Death, isn't as bad at it seems, you may become the absolute role model of a person in the world. Beautiful.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I feel somewhat discontent with the idea that we should shut a hospital because it isn't running within a budget.

The real questions you ask first are - why? These are healthcare institutions, are they treating an abnormally high number of people or is the spending elsewhere? Is the spending actually problematic or is it that the budget is unrealistic for the facilities and team there?

It's easy to say that another site may have a similar number of incidents and use it comparatively, but there are so many other underlying factors to take into account; for example, to what degree is it the capability of the medical staff on hand that is causing rising costs? Not all doctors are equal, and it's something easy to forget. Qualifications do not guarantee equal performance, only capacity to understand the workload. This distribution of skilled doctors nationwide has been skewered badly since the NHS was created; unsurprisingly, the richer areas already had the best doctors as they paid better, and that was only about 60 years ago. It would be interesting to see the number of doctors per capita for the various regions today to be honest.

A better question in my mind that we ought to ask is - when it comes to the health of the nation and the population, should we really be willing to start setting out terms of 'financial failure' defined in the terms of a business venture?

For me, healthcare is not a business or a profitable venture but an altruistic service that at one point we were proud of our achievements in.

Dani Alves (who is older and better, but plays a similar style) does not do so well when he plays as a right midfielder. For similar reasons, I don't think Walker would be at his best further forward.

In fact, I wonder what our lineup is going to look like next season. If it's AVB and he plays his favored 4-3-3, we're going to have two wide forwards rather than the wide midfielders that our system currently uses. Bale has had some trouble adjusting to being further forward, and the conventional wisdom is that he benefits from having a lot of space in front of him. I think he's talented enough to adjust, but it will take effort   and time. One possibility would be playing someone who naturally cuts inside on the left and pushing Bale to left back.

Walker would have a tougher time at RW, where a strong first touch and good dribbling skills are paramount.
