true,ax4of9,null,null,"Honestly, I have no idea what you guys are going on about. If we play a 4-3-3 next season, it means we will have 3 midfielders in the central positions. To do well both in the league as well as the cups and Europa, you would logically need at least 6 strong midfielders, with a couple extra for backup. 

We currently have the following central midfielders:

Adam, Aquilani, Lucas, Shelvey, Spearing, Henderson, Suso, Gerrard. 

Cole could be played as an attacking midfielder, but more likely as a winger now that we've lost both Maxi and Kuyt. Same for Pacheco. That's 8 midfielders here. Of these, Shelvey, Spearing and Suso are youngsters. Suso, being the youngest, is likely to see the least amount of game-time. The widely held opinion is that Spearing is at best a back-up player and Shelvey is also not ready for a first team place. 

That leaves us with 5. 

Lets break down all the players into their positions for easier recognition. Some players might be able to play more than 1 position, but I'll place them lower down the list. The 3 positions will be called DM (defensive midfielder), CM (central distributing midfielder) and AM (attacking midfielder). This fits with the positions that Rodgers is likely to play. 

DM: 
1. Lucas. 
2. Spearing. 

CM:
1. Henderson. 
2. Adam. 
3. Aquilani.
4. Suso. 

AM: 
1. Gerrard.
2. Shelvey. 
3. Aquilani.
4. Adam.
5. Henderson. 

So we have 5 players who can play the attacking midfielder position, though Aquilani, Adam and Henderson are long shots. 4 players who can play in pure center midfield, with Suso the youngest. **2** players who can play as defensive midfielder. 

Out of all our midfielders, there is a chance that Adam might be sold or let go in exchange of Dempsey. This will mean that only Henderson, Aquilani and Suso can play in the CM position. 

If Allen comes, he will be able to play the CM position, or back-up the DM position. He is also the most defensive out of all the CM players, which provides more coverage for Spearing in the event that Lucas is not playing. Last season has shown that putting Adam or Henderson beside Spearing is akin to suicide. Aquilani might be the most creative of the lot, but his defensive work and workrate has always been his weakest point. 

If we keep all our midfielders and buy Allen, that gives us 9 midfielders, with 3 of them youngsters who might be put out on loan and will see limited game-time either way. 6 choices for the first team, with about 2 strong players in each position. 

That's the bare minimum for a team that wants to reach the Top 4. 

TL;DR: We don't have too many midfielders, we barely have enough. ",0,1343197423,null,0,1343213684,0,c5j1dxh,t3_x3mbv,t1_c5j1dxh,t3_x3mbv,null,1429463344,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

If you go down to Leith then get a number 11 or 16 (or ten I think) from the centre. There are two sides to Leith – it’s got its own identity down there, and lots of the bars/restaurants along the waterfront have been redeveloped so a lot of money is coming into Leith, however there are still some really ‘old Leith’ areas, which are completely different – lots of the offroads are higgledy piggledy and full of character. The waterfront is lovely, there’s the Royal Yacht obviously, and Ocean Terminal is great for shopping, has some lovely views (one wall of it is made of glass so you can see out to sea!) and has some good restaurants inside it as well.
 
Climbing Arthur’s Seat – depends how fast you walk and where you start from! Just next to Dunsapie Loch there’s a car park and you can walk almost straight up from there – that’s where the fireworks happen in September, and people cover the hillside. I would allow maybe just over an hour, but if you pace up there all speed ahead you could do it in less. Don’t forget your camera, it’s seriously stunning up there. If you can, time it for sunset, it’s one of the most beautiful in Europe. 
 
For great coffee, and amazing Cardamom buns, go to Peter’s Yard. They also do delicious light lunches. They are near Greyfriar’s Bobby, near the top of Meadow Walk (Start walking down it and you’ll see it on the right). Famous! If you haven’t been into Greyfriar’s Cathedral it’s beautiful and underrated in my opinion.
 
Also in that area, there’s the National Museum of Scotland which is pretty cool and has a great roof garden (photo op) with info about the buildings you can see. Attached to it is the newly opened/refurbished Royal Museum which I cannot recommend highly enough. Aside from the Millenium Clock, it has an incredible cool/edgy/hip/interactive (!) natural history section, and an interactive science section which I love – we take all the students who stay with us there and they love it. Best of all it’s free! They are both on Chamber Street. On the other side of Chamber Street (further along) there is a lovely Jazz Cafe, and then if you turn left at the end and walk up South Bridge, you come to the Tron Pub. It’s a warren in there – you go right down under the city.
 
Back in the daylight, if you are at Greyfriar’s and go down Candlemaker row, you come to three amazing shops on your left as you get to the Grassmarket. The coolest hatshop in the world (my friend’s Aunt makes all the hats – it’s her shop, no I do not get a commission!); Armstrong’s, a vintage clothes shop which has a seriously amazing collection of memorabilia/costumes/mothballs and a whole cashmere section at the back which sometimes I just stand and stroke, I’m not going to lie. Finally there’s Sam Wood’ fossils, which is an institution in Edinburgh, a one of a kind shop, set up by Sam Wood himself, and definitely worth a look. You’re then on the Grassmarket which is interesting historically but apart from Helios Fountain at the far end (gifts, a whole bead section, crafts, toys etc) it’s become a bit touristy. I’d go up Victoria Street (you probably know it) with lovely boutiques, including the Cheese Shop where I used to work! You can sample free cheese there. The Grainstore is a LOVELY place to get lunch. Really good food – but if you fancy pizza there’s a Pizza Express at the top of the road.
 
On the Royal Mile, the Edinburgh Museum is amazing (fascinating, and recently re-done) and the People’s Story – opposite – don’t miss the DVD of life as it used to be. The Museum of Childhood is free, and charming, and opposite there’s a tiny close (Carrubbers Close maybe?)  packed in beside the Wee Gift shop. Go down it and you’ll find yourself at an ancient and very atmospheric Chapel, where you can do brass rubbings and wander round for free.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"I think this is a fine move. In my opinion, Joe Allen (along with Borini) will be crucial in helping implement the new tactics and formation that Rodgers is bringing to Liverpool.

Allen's presence should likely create some more competition and, ultimately, harder work from the rest of the squad as well.

Finally, as ax4of9 pointed out, we **do** need all these midfielders, we **do** need this sort of depth. We have domestic Cup competitions, Europa, trying to reach 4th place in the League. If we make Champions League, the competition is intensified yet again. If CL comes around for us, it will be great to have a couple Rodgers players (Borini and Allen) here at Liverpool, and the entire squad with a season of the Rodgers philosophy under their belt.

I don't think we're done either. Hopefully a player like Clint Dempsey will still come around as well.

Then Rodgers can spend a good portion of the season assessing who works and who does not and we could move along some players in January as well.",0,1343204310,null,0,false,0,c5j2esj,t3_x3mbv,t1_c5j2esj,t3_x3mbv,null,1429463827,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I suppose it was short-sighted to think that just because the person the comment was pointed at wouldn't see it, that it would have no effect on anyone else. Personally, I just have a hard time differentiating between what is being down voted because people simply disagree and what is being down voted for implications I don't readily recognize, especially because when I responded to the comment there were multiple down votes with no explanations as to why. 

And you are totally correct in the assertion that it isn't ""just internet stuff."" It was an attempt at an easy answer because I didn't have the time to give a more nuanced explanation of my position. Not that I have a more nuanced opinion. It is objectively mean to call anyone ugly, but I don't think that simply calling one person ugly is the same as body-shaming. Maybe I don't fully understand the concept of ""body-shaming,"" but then again, there is a good chance I don't understand much outside of my personal experience. 

I guess my point is that if something is going to be get buried in down votes, then I would like to understand why, and when I responded there was not much dialogue, and even if there was dialogue, it still didn't fit this community's definition of what is down vote worthy.

The Three Doctors features (duh) the first three Doctors, the Time Lords, introduces Omega and frees the Doctor from Earth again. Carnival of Monsters is a good example of off-earth Three. The Time Warrior introduces Sarah Jane Smith. Planet of Spiders is Three's last story and has its flaws but is again a good story overall.

Fourth: Robot is Four's first story but is, aside from some very funny moments from Tom Baker, kind of a clunker. Genesis of the Daleks is required viewing. Deasly Assassin (Time Lords, Gallifreyan society, the Master), Robots of Death (Just a great well-executed story. Great example of ""Golden Age"" Who, middle of Tom's era.) Deadly Assassin (Time Lords, Gallifrey, lots of good stuff about Time Lord technology and limitations), Invasion of Time (more Time Lords, more Gallifrey,  poorly-executed-but-still-awesome exploration of the TARDIS interior.) City of Death (fan favorite, great example of late Four. Cool John Cleese cameo,) Keeper of Traken, Logopolis (Four's last stroy) and Castrovalva (Five's first) are kind of a trilogy featuring the end of the Doctor's fourth life and a rebirth of sorts for both the Doctor and the Master. 

Five: Kinda (If you watched Castrovalva, you have been sufficiently introduced to the ""domestic"" family-style TARDIS crew of this era, which may be needed to watch this story. VERY different from most everything else done in DW. Great characters. very trippy.) Earthshock (More typical example of Five. Good cybermen story if you like them.), Snakedance (sequel to Kinda. Still trippy but darker and more typical of DW). Arc of Inifinity (Time Lords, Gallifrey, Omega), The Five Doctors (self-explanatory plus Time Lords, Gallifrye, Rassilon) Planet of Fire (I just love this story and it serves to set up:) Caves of Androzani (Five's last story, held by many, though not by me personally, to be his best ever story, I think it's great; just not his best.) 

Six: You will either hate Six or love him. There is no middle ground. The Twin Dilemma introduces him and it is arguably his worst story for many reasons. Attack of the Cybermen was his second story and is held up along with Vengeance on Varos as Six's best work and I agree. Trial of a Timelord (BEWARE fourteen parts! A whole season, Six''s last, BUT features Time Lords, Gallifrey, Time Lord corruption, the Master and the Valeyard) is really well written pretty much throughout, but at times poorly executed imo.

Seven: Time and the Rani introduces him. Again, not the best story by a looong shot. I think Greatest Show in the Galaxy is the most illustrative of the Seven/Ace relationship. Ghost Light is the most DW traditional story of his imo and a very good one. Battlefield and Rememberance of the Daleks are required viewing. Curse of Fenric is quite intense and shows interesting sides of both the Doctor and Ace. Survival is the last classic Who story ever made, is GREAT in my opinion, has a very... primal... theme and should be watched at the end of any classic Who journey involving Seven.

Eight and the tv movie: APPROACH THE FOX MOVIE WITH CAUTION. While Paul Mcgann puts in a great performance, many of the elements of DW were ""reinvented/reimagined"" for this one and may confuse anyone who is trying to understand Doctor Who ""canon"" though DW has no official canon. My advice and opinion is to take anything that may seem to be revelatory or important to the long-term scope of the DW universe in this movie with a very large grain of salt.

I hope this helps somewhat. Doctor Who has been a source of entertainment and joy to me since 1986 and I have seen all of the above mentioned stories many times. Happy viewing!

I completely disagree, it's you the people who are easily offended who make the world worse.

I'd rather use colorful language like ""offensively ugly"" than lame and tame language like ""not attractive."" In the immortal words of Stephen Fry:

The Tories have abandoned that completely, and instead expect housing associations to build their own houses using the rents they get from existing stock. That means housing companies have to find 25% more private buyers for their houses, in a time when private buyers can't get mortgages. It's a recipe for disaster.

Locally, I have seen massive building sites that had decades of work ahead of them just grind to a halt. They are finishing the current phases and closing the sites down until they can get better planning deals on the remaining lots.

**OUTSOURCING**
 
----

**PRISONS**

*Savings &amp; groan*

THE most disturbing aspect of G4S's pisspoor performance on its Olympics contract is that it is not the only important task the company
has taken on under the government's outsourcing splurge.

Its two most significant deals in the last year have been 15-year contracts to run two of Britain's biggest prisons, at Birmingham and Oakwood, which can house around 1,500 inmates. The aim is to save taxpayers large sums of money — but does it stand up to close scrutiny?

The Ministry of Justice values the Oakwood contract at £349m. This, a freedom of information request by the Eye reveals, is 1149m less than it would cost to run the prison in the public sector, where taxpayers would have to pay £498m.

Out of its £349m, G4S will need to make its standard margin on the deal, which its financial accounts suggest is 10 percent (and which might have to rise to pay for the Olympics fiasco). So it must be expecting to run the prison over this period for around £315m. Which means the geniuses at G4S are expecting to operate Oakwood for £183m — or a full 36 percent — less than it would cost the prison service. They also expect to run Birmingham at 32 percent less. Since the prison service has already been through its fair share of ""efficiency"" measures in recent years, this looks a bit of a stretch, to say the least.

The Ministry of Justice has decided it would not be in the public interest to say any more about these contracts or the sums that purport to show how the claimed savings have been calculated. Could that be because, like the private finance initiative before it, outsourcing depends on heroically optimistic financial projections and fiddled calculations? Early indications suggest it could indeed. G4S officially put the ""annual contract value"" on its Birmingham prison at £24m, while official figures show that it actually received £14.5m in less than six months up to March,
indicating an annual cost of nearer £30m.

This isn't the only discrepancy in the government's and G4S's figures: their valuations of the contracts differ by more than £70m in each case, but despite repeated requests, both refuse to explain how they valued the contracts and came to such different amounts. The suspicion lingers that neither knows what it is doing.

After taking office David Cameron criticised the secrecy of outsourcing contracts. ""I think this is ridiculous. It's your money, your government, you should know what's going on. So we're going to rip off that cloak of secrecy and extend transparency as far and as wide as possible. By bringing information out into the open, you'll be able to hold government and public services to account."" But not when it comes to contracts his own government has signed to create the illusion of savings. Then the cloak is pulled firmly back on.

----

**WORK PROGRAMME**

*Bad behaviour*

G4S also has its hands on contracts with a combined value of £183m to help the unemployed find jobs running the government's Work Programme in the North West, South East and Yorkshire.

Figures obtained under freedom of information law by the Corporate Watch campaign group show that during the first eight months of the programme G4S asked benefit offices to ""sanction"" 7,780 claimants. G4S wanted these claimants' benefits stopped because, it claimed, they had failed to turn up or do as they were told on their employment schemes.

So while G4S still wants to pocket its multi-million pound management fee for failing to find workers to provide security for the Olympics, it wants thousands of unemployed people to lose the dole for alleged misbehaviour.

----

**AMBULANCES**

*Mean-iimum wage*

THE £8.50 an hour minimum wage said to be deterring people from applying for a G4S security job at the Olympics is a full £1.25 an hour more than the company is paying some of its non-emergency ambulance drivers in London.

Even the highest trained emergency crews — one level below paramedics — receive just £9.58 an hour in the capital.

The security giant holds the ambulance contract for St George's, one of London's biggest teaching hospitals, which takes patients from all over the country. But insiders tell the Eye that G4S rarely pays above a flat rate; that the company refuses to pay London weighting even though it does so for other NHS contracts; that bullying is rife, turnover high and morale miserable.

Training for the work is also minimal. One ambulance worker taken on at the lowest grade said he was sent on a three-day first aid course, with a day's training in handling and lifting people. He felt ill-prepared, he said, when in his first week he found himself taking end-of-life cancer patients home on stretchers, hooking up patients to oxygen cylinders, trying to reassure patients and families that ""everything would be all right"", signing off ""Do Not Attempt Resuscitation"" papers and helping to carry overweight patients up narrow flights of stairs in their homes. He only stayed in the job because he hopes one day to train as a paramedic.

Another worker revealed how some staff had been taken on before full criminal record checks had been completed, even though they were dealing with vulnerable patients and children.

G4S negotiates its hospital contracts individually, thus G4S staff at St George's say they are paid less than counterparts at St Helier hospital in Sutton. As one staff member told the Eye: ""There really should not be a role for G4S in the health service. [The words] `G4S' and 'care' do not belong in the same sentence.""

If that doesn't happen then it's a few things that count, regional stability is important, as is preventing war crimes involving non-combatants, and we also have to view this as an opportunity to remove the Baathists from Syria and setup a more friendly regime. 

However, we don't have to do this in the same way that Iraq 2 was done, it would actually be better to combine the Gulf War with the recent strikes on Libya. This would mean a far heavier involvement from Arab nations, and more use of air strikes, drones and special forces to assist both the rebels and Arab/Turkish forces rather than doing the entire invasion ourselves. It's also important that we learn the lessons from Iraq 2, namely that once the regime has gone we need to focus on providing people with basic things like food, water, electricity, security and work, as our failure to do that in Iraq lead directly to the chaos that followed in the years after major combat operations had ended. 

So, I do think there are good reasons to invade Syria, however the problems with Iraq does mean that it's a very hard sell. And I'm not sure how we resolve the Russian question either.

Britain ""will find it increasingly difficult to avoid"" 


escalating ""civil war""


it was more likely that western governments would intervene to ""stop the bloodshed""

What you have to remember is that most politicians are given tons of documentation on an issue. Yes, personal opinions, morals and sheer bloody mindedness are factors in their voting records, but in most issues, politicians do genuinely vote based on the facts presented to them.

What you have to admit is that while the majority of people support decriminalisation of drugs, it would be medically a very stupid thing to do.

Politically as well, you just need one future consumer of a drug to go loopy (and lets be honest, more than one will), for the general public to be screaming about how stupid the politicians were in decriminalising drugs.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;There are plenty of gay couples out there for whom religion still is a significant part of their lives.

Which I still find just utterly absurd. Why anyone would worship a god who supposedly fire-bombed two entire cities until they were razed because they were full of gay people, is just beyond me.

&gt;Under the current laws, the state won't recognise their marriage under a deity even if the religious establishment was willing to accept and perform the ceremony.

Perhaps the state should just stop recognising marriages under deities then.

&gt;It's about the state allowing everyone the same choices as the each other

While I've got no issue with full legal rights for gay people, currently everyone does have the same choices. Gay marriage introduces an *extra* choice for gay people.

&gt;If you want to flip it let's say you, because you're straight, you can only be married in a Church under the sight of a god. Wouldn't you want the choice?

As I said though, I support full legal equality already. I just don't see the need to impinge upon the religious aspect of gay = hellbound. I mean, it's horrible and repugnant and utterly ridiculous, but this just feels like an intentional effort to rob them of something quite unnecessarily - just because the winds have turned and it's possible to stick it to 'em.",0,1343223316,null,0,false,0,c5j4lph,t3_x4j8i,t1_c5j4lph,t1_c5j4id7,null,1429464924,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

You need to remove your fervent atheist/anti-religious sentiments from your thought processes and, to quote a phrase, 'judge the situation dispassionately'.

I'm an atheist, I understand the idea of being married under God is absurd but for some people it's not; some people (sexuality being immaterial) believe that only under God can a union of two individuals be properly recognised. If that's what they believe, if that's how they choose to validate their choice of life partner, then I think they should be welcome to it.

I think you've misinformed.
&gt; currently everyone does have the same choices [sic]

This is not true. At this moment in time, under law, two people cannot have their marriage legally recognised by the state if they are of the same sex and they had their ceremony conducted with religious rights. It simply won't be recognised, they won't be a ""family entity"", they would still be two individuals who may or not be co-habiting.

Holyrood is not trying to add a third 'Gay Marriage' option. They are simply removing limitation in the current definition of plain regular marriage.

---

&gt; Perhaps the state should just stop recognising marriages under deities then.

Not only is this a different discussion this is outright dangerous. Now you want to force your anti-religious/atheist views on everyone and oppress the religious and remove their available choice? You're going against your own stated views:

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The problem is that their religion does consider homosexuality to be a sin, it's arguably a part of their holy book as well as having been a fairly long standing stance of the Church. So, you cannot really have a rational argument about this in the same way as one would debate black people being prevented from renting an apartment by a racist landlord. 

So, in order to side step an irrational argument regarding the contents of a religious tome the best option is to simply allow gay people to get married, and allow religions to retain control over the way marriage works in their faith. This is the path of least resistance, and is going to be the method of giving the majority of gay couples the equality they want. It's not a perfect solution, but it's far better than going to war with the CoE and holding up the entire process. 

So view it as an evolutionary step rather than an attempt at a revolution. I have no doubt that I will live to see the CoE backing gay marriages but I want that change to come from within, and I'm very sure it will happen sooner rather than later.

&gt; Furthermore, if Churches are granted this privilege to discriminate, should shops, hotels, B&amp;Bs, etc., also be granted this privilege?

It drives up demand which drives up production which drives up labour which in turn drives up demand again. At the other end though, if that spending is done through consumer debt, then it only makes sense to save or pay down the debts incurred which drives down demand, etc. etc. One of the things that happened in the 20th and early 21st century was over-easy access to credit. It allowed real wages to stagnate if not decline since families didn't feel the pressure to ask for raises since they could pay for their new BBQ on a credit card. So a credit bubble has burst and the demand is grinding to a halt as neither consumers nor lenders want to go out for drinks with each other.

I had been hoping the inclusion of a contrasting view might lead to a debate on the subject.

\------

As for the point you made I take a different view. I think that the law should allow all people latitude to make their own moral choices without the imposition of restrictions by the state. I can't think of a compelling reason to allow one persons moral views to interfere with someone else's private affairs. If you don't support ""gay marriage"" then don't participate - don't marry someone who is the same sex as you, don't attend the wedding and most of all don't be a self-righteous fun-sponge about it. If it doesn't effect you in your own life then you don't have a say. As such, two men or two women marrying won't effect the operation of the state to any great degree (that I'm aware of) so why should the state be allowed to interfere.

And I appreciate this is a somewhat flawed argument. Someone stealing from my home is not an imposition upon the state and yet we legislate against that and have state agencies which enforce that mandate. And I can't even say that it's acceptable because it's a universally held belief because it's not, and then we're enforcing the will of a majority - which would contradict my own point that the majority should not hold sole governance.

Allen is better than Henderson in every way.  He'll do multiple things for us and fills a vital role in the strategy that Rodgers is looking to employ.  He can provide cover for Lucas if he gets hurt again, which is something that no other player in the side can even come close to doing.  He is also able to pass intelligently and distribute the ball with care and a focus on retaining possession.  Players like Henderson, Adam, Spearing, etc aren't really acclimatized to this kind of philosphy (tiki taka).  

Adam is just generally bad actually, as is Spearing.  Henderson can adapt, but it'll take time.  Aquilani is very much an unsolved riddle for Liverpool and it seems clear that Rodgers isn't completely confident that he can fill this sort of role.  Gerrard is a different sort of player than is required to play in the distribution/retention role in midfield.  I'm expecting Gerrard to fill a more advanced/attacking role similar to that of Sigurdsson for Swansea last season, which is where he's at his best anyway.

I think Allen is a very exciting young talent who has immense potential and he's very capable of being a major player at Anfield.

I see it, but I also see the origins of the concept and that to achieve gay marriage we essentially have to destroy the sacredness of marriage for the religious. Now, what I'm saying further to that is that I just don't see the need for this. I do not understand why the religious can not just keep their concept of marriage intact, and the rest of us who're already in the 21st century just get civil partnerships with identical legal rights.

It just seems like taking advantage of the fact that the church is now weak and gay rights groups are widely accepted and stronger in order to score points against the religious for the sake of doing so.

&gt;so the state should not be discriminating in who it offers these to.

On this I agree, but then I think the solution to that is offer state wide legal partnerships to all, and nothing more.

We bought him when he was injured, the injury wasn't his fault. He took awhile to come back from it, but so did Carroll, and no one talks about that. If we're talking about his loans back to Italy, his first loan was done by Hodgson, the same guy who loaned out our only left back just so he could play his star boy Konchesky. While there is no denying that he was homesick and unsettled, I believe Woy made no attempt to keep him. The second loan was one that he didn't actually want. There was a video of him talking to Comolli where it was believed he wanted more chance at a first team place, but Comolli denied him that assurance because Kenny wanted to play 4-4-2 and Gerrard and Adam were considered to be above him. I think there was an interview with Kenny where he basically admitted that Aquilani left because of a lack of first team chances. 

I'm not saying he is utterly loyal and committed to Liverpool, but it is just as easy to look at things from his point of view and see that maybe he felt unwanted at the club.

Sterling's not ready yet. Unless Rodgers pulls something left-field like using Gerrard or Johnson on the wings, we do need signings there, especially when our problem last season wasn't creativity or defending but rather scoring goals.

I agree about Allen providing cover for Lucas if needed, and he's currently more suited to tiki-taka than Henderson. Adam isn't ""generally bad"", but definitely doesn't suit Rodgers' system and I'd be surprised if he's still with us come September 1. I'm curious to see whether Spearing can adapt, but if he went I wouldn't be up in arms about it. It's too early to say whether Aquilani has convinced or not; it seems more likely, as always, that if Aquilani leaves it will be because he doesn't want to be here than he isn't good enough. Agreed on Gerrard.

Like I said - it's not whether Allen is worth 13m himself, but is he worth 13m to us? Henderson certainly can and should develop into that distribution role, and I'd argue Rodgers' system puts far less onus on the defensive midfield player to tackle like crazy than was the case under Kenny, where the rest of the midfield and attack could get away with not defending much because our defensive midfielder was probably the very best in the league. If this is the case, then Lucas' absence, while always a blow, wouldn't be as significant in a Rodgers system as it was under Kenny's.

Allen's obviously a good talent who could do well for us; but does he solve our biggest priority right now? I don't think he does, and on that basis I'm reluctant to spend what's probably a sizeable chunk of our transfer budget on him when we're so thin in the front three.",0,1343234923,null,0,false,0,c5j7cwn,t3_x4pd5,t1_c5j7cwn,t1_c5j74gs,null,1429466215,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Military service is a strange thing and I don't think I'll ever get use to people thanking me for doing it.  Less than 1% of the American population serve, and of those that do, few do so out of a need to serve the country.

I was 29 years old when I went to bootcamp and did so because I needed options and a paycheck.  I thought that my case would be a little more unique but quickly found that most people join for one of two reasons ... either they have absolutely NO idea what they want to do with their lives or because they need the GI Bill for three years of free education after (plus free adv. education while active duty).

In such, I guess what I am trying to say is to show your support by putting pressure on your house and senate representatives when the news starts talking about there not being a military budget and the .gov  could get shut down.  What that equates to is nobody in the military getting paid; their families no longer supported; their bills not paid.  A service-member can't refuse to work even if they aren't being paid.

Make a civil partnership the legal documentation that you sign to get all the current civil partnership/marriage perks. Then if you want to have a ceremony in a church or a castle or a registry office you can, that's the marriage ceremony. If you just want to sign a civil partnership agreement then you can do that too.

This would solve all the problems about who can and can't get married, and where they can do it, if I church wants to give some gay guys a marriage ceremony, great, if it doesn't ok, its up to the church.

Using the word marriage ties the whole thing up too much with the church and religion (also the history of marriage is far from rosy and something that a lot of people are trying to distance themselves from - hence the straight civil partnership movement).

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"This isn't a moral stance, it's purely pragmatic, I think gay people should be allowed to get married and this is simply the fastest way to achieve this goal.

As for the discrimination aspect, again this is different. If it's the government who won't allow you to marry then you can tackle that via the legal system. It's a rule that was made by man, so it can be changed by man. All you need to do is convince enough people to change their minds about it and the law can be changed one way or another. 

However the rules that faiths operate by are supposed to be from a higher power than man, so even if a court agrees with your position, it doesn't actually mean much. Look at the issue of the ordination of women, still divisive in the church today despite the actual problem with the ordination of women being far less clear than issues with gay marriage.

As for religious beliefs allowing individuals to discriminate, remember ""Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's"". The state can set the laws which Christians have to live by but it cannot change the religion itself. 

The last and possibly most important point is that the Anglican faith is quite popular in African nations which hold some remarkably backward views on homosexuality such as [Uganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Uganda). So you have to remember that the Anglican Communion is home to people as diverse as [Giles Fraser](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15476070) and [Thomas Musoke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruT1zswRVAU). [There is already a substantial rift in the Anglican Communion between the more liberal western nations and far more conservative places such as Africa](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2156406/Anglican-church-schism-declared-over-homosexuality.html). So if the CoE does back gay marriage or is forced into it then it will face a huge internal crisis.

Since then Iran has been subject to an increasing number of sanctions and trade embargoes which have significantly hindered military development. However I do agree that western nations would be unlikely to find the loss of life that an occupation would result in acceptable, either from the perspective of the military death toll or the modern civilian views on what war is like. Given that it would be a far harder fight than Iraq was, and it would be more likely that the Iranian military would plan for such a war given they have very little chance of significantly delaying an invasion let alone halting one.

Still, it would be possible for the Iranian government to be taken out and the country pacified.

I'm afraid I can't agree with that. I think that that's precisely what ethics are - ethics are the rules by which we govern ourselves and our actions. Ethics are a product of our upbringing, our experiences and our own cognitive processes. You can't say that your ethics can be applied across the board and everyone should stick to them because your ethics were generated out of a situation unique to you and may not be applicable to anyone else.

What you suggested is that we should apply your ethics upon the faithful and make them feel uncomfortable when they raise objections to same-sex marriages. That goes against my ethical code because I will not and do not condone the imposition of my will, my codes and my constructs onto unwilling subjugates. I would rather try and come to an understanding and make a mutually beneficial compromise than force someone else to bend to my will.

&gt; Equality and universalism are pretty central to any sensible ethical structure.

This is an example of why you can't apply ethic across the board. The word ""sensible"" is again relative to you, and your views and your experiences. You might not think my point of view on this matter is sensible but to me, it's the only sensible way which I can conduct myself. You can't make sweeping generalisations about something as complicated, or as important, as human morality because to do so runs the risk of becoming what the Church used to be, an absolute moral authority on all matters. And I think you would agree that, even assuming they had the best intentions at the time, they got many many things wrong.

You summed up my perspective almost perfectly with this.

&gt; I have good solid justifiable reasons for my ethics

That's right **you** have justifiable rationales, generated by **your** own mental processes, for **your** ethics - how **you** conduct yourself and how **you** behave. But you can't apply those same principles to me. They might not fit, they might not match.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; yet the coalition forces took just over a month to beat the Iraqi forces into submission 3 years later

That's really not a fair comparison. The Iraqi army was in bad shape following the war with Iran. Iraq as a nation was literally bankrupt, due to the cost of the war and their ongoing economic trolling from Kuwait driving down the oil prices. That and the slant-oil drilling from Kuwait into the Iraqi fields is what led them to invade Kuwait out of nothing beyond utter desperation. This is clear from the wikileaks diplomatic cables, very interesting reading. They were in no shape to fight that war to begin with. Most of the equipment for the invasion was abandoned by the retreating troops. 

Following this they were under some of the strictest economic and arms sanctions the world has ever seen. No western, Russian or Chinese sources at all. Their army was literally stuck in the past. Their troops were completely demotivated and hid in 2003 with either the intention of deserting the army completely or more dangerously, waiting to form an insurgency. If I were a tin pot dictator I would have my troops do just that. No sense rolling out onto an battlefield just to be cut down by a vastly superior foe who obliterates them from beyond the horizon. 

Iran is the complete opposite. While they've been unable to access western arms markets for quite  some time pretty much everyone else will sell to them. Their army is reasonably modern and well maintained. As for morale, many oppose the current government and always have since the revolution put them in power. However, these same people put aside their differences when invaded by Iraq and there is a very real risk of that happening again. They know through personal experience what it's like to be a western puppet state. The current ""regime"" may be bad but they haven't forgotten the time when it was worse. 

America or Britain hasn't picked a fight with a decently armed foe since Korea and they only managed to win half that peninsula through some risky gambits.

true,Gettingbetter,eng-durham,Durham,"EDIT: I'm not sure if you're arguing that a government's role in economy is the same as an individual or family's role. I will assume that you are equating the two, since I was talking about the role of government stimulus in a spending crunch variety of recession/depression.

I should have been more clear. They Keynsian solution has the government become a proxy for consumers. Consumers have no choice but to pay down debt and live more frugally, so the government begins spending to keep demand up which keeps people employed thus averting a spiral where decreased demand leads to companies closing factories and people losing jobs decreasing demand further and so on and so forth. 

I think we can all agree that *individuals* should save money and spend frugally. Lord knows I advocate as much. It's at the **societal level** that it becomes problematic. However, Keynes acknowledged that modern capitalist economies are built on a bulwark of consumer spending, so if that consumer spending falls off a cliff governments by investing in infrastructure, education and growth which helps transition the country and the labour force for the new normal while buoying  demand for jobs and labour until the private sector recovers. Once a recovery has sufficiently stabilised, governments can gradually reduce spending and raise taxes again to pay down their debts as consumers can more or less support the economy. In short, the government saves when times are good, and spends when times are bad to act as a relief valve for consumer spending.

As to the morality of consumerism and frugality, the tension between the two is a problem. Couple this with the mistrust in the banking system that we have right now and no one wants to borrow and no one wants to lend. Money is literally just sitting tight as everyone looks around to see where the other shoe is going to drop, and until it gets moving again and people can invest in businesses or factories or whathaveyou no recovery will be forthcoming.

He wrote all kinds of vastly different stories and found a way to connect them, where as moffat seems to write one overall plotline. I was struggling in a similar way, but it's because of the lack of one particular writer. When three or four writers have their 'style' its like an ingredient. You miss an ingredient it's going to 'taste' different so to speak. When you write, and need to lock things together, sometimes the reveal is sweet, but mostly, it's an 'omg...what?"" sort of bitter sweet, as it's this reaction that ushers the audience to feel an emotion towards the fact they have learned. Moffats style is more....trueblood-y for lack of a better example. You watch the episode, a lot happens, some stuff gets resolved, but it's all really leading towards the BIG REVEAL. Some writers have little things, like Davies, and some have one super big thing. Some keep you glued to your tele by your heart strings, and others with suspense.

&gt;If the mainstream business model makes you bankrupt, you will have to change and diversify, find niche market in order to survive.

Doesn't really work in real-life/business, many years ago many dairy farms switched to organic, then because everyone jumped on the band wagon the price plummetted, same as the Oil seed rape issue, farmer finds niche-everyone copies nich-price plummets farmer goes on to next thing. 
Farming is not a business that can change rapidly, even good practise requires that a crop from one year cannot be grown on the same land the following year. It is not like a retail business or a banking business, it is an agricultural business which due to subsidy and markets it is difficult to change and all returns take a minimum of 5 years after heavy investment.

I'm saying that the irreligious and gay rights groups should consider it, yes. Beyond legal rights and protections,  ""marriage"" is just a word to us, that is it. To the religious they actually believe it's a holy sacrament or something and that God somehow smiles down upon them and requires it of them.

Why not let them have that, for the sake of a word? I'm not saying we have to, I'm not saying I'll oppose this move to introduce gay marriage, I'm just saying, can't we take the higher ground here to make everyone happy?

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Preventing individuals or organisations who offer services to the public from discriminating on the grounds of gender/sexuality would be an example of setting laws that Christians have to live by. Churches could offer same-sex marriage (or stop conducting marriages altogether) while still believing it is wrong.

Again. You're trying to think about an irrational problem rationally. They aren't providing a service in the same way that a hotel chain provides wedding facilities, they are providing a religious ceremony in accordance with their faith.  And their interpretation of their faith tells them that gay marriage is wrong, that it goes against what marriage means to them and to do so would not be in good conscience. In their eyes the problem is similar to a vegan pie van being told it had to sell steak and kidney pies. 

&gt; Plenty of other organisations have faced internal crises as a result of anti-discrimination laws, from the military to the BNP.

The military hasn't in all honesty. From reading /r/military when DADT was repealed the vast majority of service members didn't seem to care, same with the British military when openly gay people were allowed to serve back in 2000. Desegregation of units back in the 40's was mostly the same. As for the BNP, it didn't really suffer a crisis. It's an organization that attracts racists so it's highly unlikely that black or Asian people are clamoring to join. 

But honestly, stop trying to deal with this rationally. You won't get anywhere with that approach. ",0,1343257208,null,0,false,0,c5jdwrh,t3_x4j8i,t1_c5jdwrh,t1_c5jbvqj,null,1429469368,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

  Definitely vegetarian (even vegan) friendly and he's always willing to accommodate. It's choose your own filling, etc, so you can control what goes in/on your food.   
So when you're not in the mood or don't have time to have a proper sit down meal, just nip in Jack's for a burrito and beer :)

Consider the service industry: do you think that waiters, house cleaners, and taxi drivers have a 'need' to wait tables, clean houses, and chauffer people around? Probably not. However, their job is a service to the customer, and even if it's just a business transaction, it's good to appreciate the people who have served you, even if it was done for pay rather than out of the goodness of their hearts. The populace are your customers, and they pay you through their taxes. Even though you as an individual haven't served any citizen as an individual, the military as a body services the civilian population as a body. (Well, in theory it should, anyway.)

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The only areas where the military of Iran poses a threat is ballistic missiles, USS Cole style attacks via fastboats and some of it's AA sites. The conventional ground forces aren't that capable compared to western forces (a lot of their kit is still quite old), it's air force is largely based on aging US planes and some ex-Soviet planes, neither of which aged well and it lacks modern electronic warfare systems or sensors. It also has a huge deficit of experience compared to the US, who has spent much of the post war period at war in one form or another and has a huge pool of actual combat experience, both conventional and unconventional, to draw from. On top of this Iran has fallen victim to several cyber-warfare attacks quite recently and given this it is likely that far more is going on than the public know about. 

So while I fully accept that any invasion would result in far higher casualties than we're used to, I don't really think it would be impossible for an invasion by US forces (backed by a coalition of Arab states and some EU nations) to result in the fall of Tehran relatively rapidly. 

As I said where I see the main problem in Iran is that the Iranians know their conventional forces aren't going to be much use if they try to fight the US lead coalition in a straight war. The military they have is setup to intimidate their regional neighbors more than it is to defend against any invasion. The only area where they would see some success is the ballistic missile program which is likely to cause significant damage to gulf oil production and shipping, while also likely to disrupt or damage any naval forces in the area. 

The real danger comes from unconventional warfare though, which is an area that Iran gained a lot of experience with in Iraq over the last decade. Firstly USS Cole style attacks using fast boats could be really damaging and even cripple a number of vessels during the opening stages, however this would only work a few times and is something that is to be expected. The real danger comes from insurgency tactics honed in Iraq, and given your comments about factions at odds with each other unifying to counter an external threat would be lethal. Any sensible Iranian general commanding infantry wouldn't stand and fight, they would order everyone to remove their uniforms, hide all the kit and wait until the front line passed before bringing out the IED's, EFP's and snipers. Which is where the far higher number of casualties comes into play, it wouldn't be a few hundred over the course of a decade for the British, it would be thousands a year, and tens of thousands a year for the US. Keeping any sustained occupation going would make the financial drain of Iraq or Afghanistan look like pocket change. And most importantly the civilian populations of the US and the UK would start seeing noticeable effects on their daily lives as more and more resources were diverted to the war, while workfare programs were replaced with army recruitment drives. *(But hey, unemployment would be down and spending would be up - those calling for Keynesian might get what they wanted in some horrible twisted way...)*

The best option with Iran is to go in, smash the remaining military, destroy anything even remotely connected with the nuclear or ballistics programs and topple the government. Prior to doing this use all the CIA tactics you can to mobilize and supply any rebel groups or dissidents you can find, regardless of what they stand for, assassinate as many of the key people as you can and use cyberwarfare programs to cause as much disruption as you can. Then leave, and let Iran collapse in on itself for a decade or so, helped by sanctions and trade embargoes. After a decade, go back in with a stabilization and reconstruction force to rebuild Iran into whatever we want.

Sterling and Suso hold onto the ball too much, but are brilliant. Would like to loan them to EPL sides if possible.

Pacheco and Shelvey should be in our plans this year. Shelvey is a no-brainer. Pacheco is inconsistent, but he's ready to get some time.

Poor Spearo. But I thought Eccleston was active today, I liked his movement. 

Adam and Cole both have big roles to play this year for us, I think. Hopefully positive ones. Aquilani has great touch, too, though he disappears a bit too much for my liking.

McLaughlin, Sama, and Morgan look bright, we should be seeing more of them in the coming years.

Flanno looks confident out there. I'd be okay if I never saw Gulasci again.

[This link](http://www.arts.ed.ac.uk/celtic/poileasaidh/) will give you a ton of information on language policy and planning efforts for Gaelic. Edinburgh's Linguistics master's programmes offer the chance to take a few courses in this area but it's not a specialisation as far as I'm aware. Many people in the Linguistics and English Language department there work on issues relating to Gaelic or Scots policy/planning. Keith Williamson was working on a Gaelic revitalisation project for a while. There's also a lot of work out there on Scots, if you're interested in that.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig offers a Gaelic Language and Culture degree, but it's undergraduate. Their MA has a focus on Gàidhealtachd history and culture but not really a revitalisation component, and it's not linguistics based.

If you'd like pointers to more articles or to specific people, I can try to help with that.

true,Gnostic_Mind,null,null,"Bootcamp was difficult because of my age.  I was really skinny (5'7"" 119lbs) and hadn't been very active nor consumed a healthy diet for a few years so my body had some serious adjusting to do.  Being on your feet 18 hours a day while breaking in not only a new pair of boots but also my feet was painful.  

Being older, I also think the culture shock hit me a bit more than the younger recruits.  Being older, I think I was more set in my ways and in such, it was harder for my mind to wrap around the conditioning.

However, in spite of these weaknesses, I excelled in other areas, like project management and the leadership required to get the job done without sacrificing the backs of those working for me.

No matter what branch of the service you enter, you are going to do grunt work, however, the right job will help limit the amount you do.  It's the difference between having a physical job where breaking your back is an everyday thing and breaking your back only once in awhile because additional manpower is required to complete a command-wide task (like boxes of food and supplies arriving that need to be distributed and stored appropriately).

It sounds like you have the same job mindset that I had.  I didn't want to be in a fox-hole.  I didn't want to be a trigger-man.  I wanted a job where I used my mind more so than my brawn to complete and or assist the mission.  Because of this I looked at the Airforce first, but their max age for a new recruit was 27 so I was to late (plus without a degree and a minor criminal history I had zero chance of them letting me in in-spite of my age).

I went to a Navy recruiter looking for a job working IT since I had owned a small end-user repair business in the past and felt I would absorb their job training with relative ease.  They told me I couldn't get the clearance but suggested a bunch of electronics related jobs (I scored obscenely high in electronics on the ASVAB).  I didn't want to be responsible for aircraft falling out of the sky and told them they would have to do better than that.  They reviewed my paperwork for a bit and in a section containing my hobbies they saw I had 'writing'.  They offered me a job as a Mass Communication Specialist (Navy public relations, photography, graphic design, videography, broadcasting, journalism), and I took it.

With this job I spent nearly a year in training (including bootcamp and an additional 2 month class for a specialization in graphics) then four years on an aircraft carrier, eventually running the ships print/graphics shop supporting 5000+ crew and a 99% mission success-rate during a 7 month deployment.

Between traveling around the world (England, Spain, Italy, Bahrain, Dubai and France in 7 months), 3 years of free education plus a paycheck while you go (the GI Bill) as well as the numerous other veteran benefits ... I can tell you that it is a perfect launching point for rebooting your life.  You'll have 4ish years job and management experience, a security clearance and the title of Vet. to work your way into the job market.

If you choose to go to a navy recruiter, feel free to send me a msg to ask me about the jobs they are offering.  I'll give you an idea of what you'll be getting into.",0,1343265036,null,0,false,0,c5jfxy9,t3_x52lu,t1_c5jfxy9,t1_c5jf9fn,null,1429470326,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Some people have started to apply game theory to language policy and planning, which is a relatively new application. Recently published is ""Paradigm Shift in Language Planning and Policy: Game-Theoretic Solutions"" by Mouton de Groutyer, I don't know if it's in warehouses yet. It's likely to be quite a controversial idea.

John Walsh from the school of Language, Literatures and Cultures at the National University of Ireland just published a case study of Irish language legislation in the latest issue of Language Policy. You should read Language Policy regularly, if you don't already. I also recommend ""Language revitalization discourses as metaculutre: Gaelic in Scotland from the 18th to 20th centuries"" by Emily McEwan-Fujita in 'Language and Communication' (31). You should also look into the [SCOTS project](http://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk), which is a maintenance attempt from the corpus linguistics side of things. There are a number of articles out there by the people who are involved in the project discussing the hows, whats, and whys of the projects. It's a great, and growing, corpus.

If you've been out of school for a while, grab an ASVAB training book at any local bookstore and brush up on your basics before you take the official test.  That investment WILL open up more job opportunities for you.  It's the difference between building and tending to large explosives to working military intelligence.  If you are more mechanically inclined and don't mind getting durty, Hull Tech's are always in demand (and worth a fortune in the civilian market).

The Navy will always push air-related jobs.  They need people on the flightdeck (rated the most dangerous job in the world).  But honestly the choice is yours.  As long as you score high on the asvab and can get a security clearance you'll be good to go.  With those two things the only other thing you'll need is patience.

A recruiter will tell you they don't have any positions open for a specific job you want and try to direct you toward other jobs.  Stick with what you want and tell them you'll wait for a slot to open.  This may mean you wait until October 1st (fiscal newyear and all quota's and finances reset to new budget), or they call you out of the blue one day and say a slot's open, but you have to leave the next day if you want it.

I waited 7 months to get the job I wanted.  ",0,1343269288,null,0,false,0,c5jh1fp,t3_x52lu,t1_c5jh1fp,t1_c5jgqyc,null,1429470850,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Our youth have solid futures, all of them, it's just Spearing's is not here.

Cons
Suso relies too heavily on his left foot, he also should look up to shoot a la David Silva.

What do Samsung do to pay us back? Give us another shitty shirt contract that is what. 

Liverpool, City, United and Sunderland are being paid by sponsors 20M per year for shirt deals while Chelsea is receiving the hefty amount of 13 million per year after winning the Champions league and F.A cup.

Moreover they want us to give them naming rights to the Stadium after all the B.S they are putting us through?. This is why Chelsea is making all these small sponsorship deals with Sauber etcetera.

I think we will be parting ways with Samsung soon and for good reason.

I, the one in the purple shirt, immediately  geeked out and ran over to get pictures. I was able to talk to Steven Moffat briefly, mostly about writing and ending to season 2 of Sherlock. Matt Smith was very funny and cracked lots of jokes. I told him once the open bar ended I would buy him a Heineken (his choice), he saw me about two hours later and reminded me I still owed him. He came to the bar with me and I actually got the beer for him and a glass of red wine for Moffat.  Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill were AWESOME! They invited us to hang out with them while smoking, I got to chat them up for over twenty minutes about all sorts of random things! I asked her about the Inspector Spacetime rumors and the age-old debate, Star Wars vs. Star Trek. Spoiler Alert! Much to my sadness she prefers Star Trek, but I will get over it! I have been mostly a lurker on Reddit but I couldn't resist sharing. We actually met a lot of other very cool and down to earth celebs too, like Richard Madden (Rob Stark) for example.

It would be more like if I said I really enjoyed Adam West as Batman, and you told me I was wrong because there will never be an actor better than Christian Bale playing Batman. It's apples to oranges, as they're both portraying very opposing versions of the same character.

During the game I was agreeing with most of you about individual player evaluations, but I realized it's only July and there was no where close to a first eleven out on the field.

I'd be willing to bet that Rodgers is just instilling the quick pass philosophy right now and there hasn't been much focus on tactics.  Hopefully this is why many players were trying to do to much on their own.

Attack: looked headless.  Did not seem to be a real plan or coordination and any long ball (including set pieces) looked waaay off the mark.  (Excluding Jonjo's near miss).  Only really attacking option seemed to be finding an open lane after one-two's out of the midfield.  Then again we are missing 6 or 7 players that could make it into a first team sheet on the attack.

Midfield:  Everyone seemed to hold the ball up nicely and there were a lot of great passes.  This was tough to judge because both the back line and attack were all over the place.

Defense:  Looked totally uncoordinated and this definitely aided both of Roma's goals.  That said, these were totally make-shift back lines.  This is a place where familiarity is paramount.  They *rarely* played passes back to the goalkeepers.  I was genuinely surprised by this as it eliminates a player from the tika-taka play and forces more people to come back and get the ball.

GKs: Didn't see much the first half, but was right behind Jones in the second half.  He looked great!  He made a few fantastic saves and really wasn't at fault on either goal.  ",0,1343278392,null,0,false,0,c5jjjk2,t3_x5ukz,t1_c5jjjk2,t3_x5ukz,null,1429472375,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,Dean_Moriarty,null,null,"Chelsea fan second, Philadelphia Union fan first here, you couldn't be more off.  The league started playing in 65,000 NFL stadiums.  Attendance was poor and the atmosphere sucked and there were constantly football (american) lines on the field.  Not conducive to growing the game nor conducive to getting butts in seats.

New league initiative is to get every team a soccer specific stadium, and many teams have been able to do this which has allowed the league to expand to 19 teams with more to come.  

All these new SSS stadiums are built to be able to expand in the future in the hopes that the sport continues to grow.  So when teams build their new stadiums they have to plan out how many tickets they can average per game over the next so many years.  PPL Park's normal capacity is 18,500 with room for more in standing only.  Tonight's attendance was something like 19,400 a stadium record (only 2 1/2 years in existance).

So to answer your baffle, they could have had the game at the Linc, where the Philadelphia Eagles play, but the league has moved beyond that.  We have our own stadiums now, built for our own needs, and we need to prove to the rest of the country that we are a league that deserves attention on our own merit and that we don't have to piggyback on the NFL or College anymore.

The movie itself just didn't delve into this aspect of The Master.

As for the intro, the movie got it wrong. I love the movie, but I admit that they didn't seem to care to get their own story right on this one. They glazed over a lot of details.

Basically The Master had been outcasted from Gallifrey, and was currently helping The Daleks achieve their goals. The Daleks discovered that The Master was, in fact, betraying them behind their backs, and they had him executed. If I recall, the 'trial' the movie talks about isn't a traditional trial, but is more in reference to the Daleks discussing whether or not he was betraying them.

After being found out, in his moments before death, he created a psychic link with The Doctor pleading him to retrieve his remains and have them brought back to Gallifrey so that he could finally be at rest on his home planet. The Doctor finds himself unable to deny the final requests of someone, let alone someone he used to be close friends with.

I live nowhere near the games in Chiswick. We have a games lane on the A4 and i'm happy with that. Fair enough, I guess, the coca cola executives don't want to be in traffic. What I don't understand is why they have changed the priorities on roads that are clearly nowhere near any event. As a result we have tailbacks to Hammersmith and this is actually holding up the odd official vehicle trying to get to Chiswick. 

I am also growing more that a little frustrated at the over zealous LOCOG advertising police. Get over yourself. It's hardly going to affect Addidas is Zara or the likes mentions the olympics. 

My final bone of contention is that as Londoners we had to pay a levy on our council tax for years. What did we get in return? No priority on tickets (not even 1% was held back), shit traffic jams and constant dictatorial comments over what we can and cannot do. 

Other than that I am very excited about the games. Honest.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;insular communities like sub-reddits is that they tend to very quickly homogenise- it's why [1] /r/atheism

But I've never really seen this subreddit do that before, and become so one sided. It really has been quite shocking. I've got a lot of time for this subreddit, it's actually good for constructive debate and informative comments, but on the subject of the Olympics, and I don't say this lightly, it has gonna all r/atheism. Not to mention, the anti-Olympics thing has almost become a fuckign meme, and one of my favourite things about /r/uk is that we are meme-free.

&gt;I hardly think the Pro-Olympics message needs to be expressed

That's a fair point, but so many people have turned on the Olympics now and I can't help but think it's a snow ball effect of constant moaning.

&gt;it's the majority Media opinion

It's not though. A lot of big newspapers have been trashing the Olympics.

&gt;Don't do it man, never Daily Mail yourself. Go hang out in some majority yank subreddits, they're usually game for assuming everything'll be great.

That's the thing. The DM assumes everything is shit, not great. And they've been saying it is shit all this time. But even they've realised that this could be a bit of fun. Even outside of sports perspective, I think it's fun that the whole world has been invited to London for a carnival effectively. Also, I'll steer clear of the main yank subreddits thank you very much. I went in one last night for the first time in ages. Such a shit hole.

Anyway, I said I'm not debating it any more. We're both fine in our opinions, you're a miserable wanker, I'm a fool clouded by jingoism. But if you could, I'd ask that you don't put too many people off of the party. Because at this stage, those in the miserable wanker camp have got nothing to gain from that, whilst the fools would stand to lose. Nobody's a winner in that scenario.

true,refcon,null,null,"There were many reasons why, this list is not the sum total and will probably not reflect the political leanings of many;

1) Inefficiency - British gas was not an efficient organisation. You needed to have a gas meter fitted? Well they could get round to that in a few months, repeat this story for many other aspects of the business. They had no incentive to be more efficient, or even offer good customer service as no one could go anywhere else. 

Was the service uniformly bad? No, of course not. However it could be improved, and privatisation was the ideological approach of Thatcher. 

2) The creation of a 'Share holder society' - Thatcher and many others in her inner circle believed that the in order to change the post war consensus people had to move from a society that rents to a society that owns. Privatising British Gas/Telecoms et all was a move designed to make people owners of things. 

This she believed would make them more natural Conservatives - then the party of the Middle classes. Remember in the 70's80's the Labour party still had clause 4, still believed in total nationalisation. If you make  the majority of people owners of capital, then they would oppose Labour's attempts to seize control of the privately owned capital. 

3) Belief that the size of the state should be shrunk - The UK state in the 1970's employed millions of workers, from steel manufacturing to the civil service to telecommunications engineers. Thatcher believed that the state was larger then it should be, that it intruded to much into peoples lives. The best way to shrink the state would be to remove the industries privatised in the late 40's-70's.

By doing this she also removed the state from deciding wages for workers in these industries. This was a dangerous thing for governments, they either lost popularity by fighting the Unions and causing strikes, or they lost popularity by caving in to the Unions and allowing inflation causing wage increases. This was even more important for the Tories - Heath was told in a wage negotiation that the gola of the Union was to ''Bring your Fucking government down''(I am at work but so I cant source this quote, it is in Andrew Marr's 'History of Modern Britain' if you have it on your shelf).

&gt;The Office for National Statistics said the PSNBR, excluding the bank rescue funds, rose last month to £14.45bn from £13.92bn in June 2011.

&gt;Archer said borrowing for the first three months of the financial year amounted to £42.9bn, which is up from £38.4bn in the first three months of 2011/12.

&gt;""In other words, the underlying PSNBR is up by 11.7% year-on-year in the first three months of 2012/13 compared with a targeted drop over the whole fiscal year of around 4.5%,"" he said. ""If this trend was to be continued over the rest of the fiscal year, the PSNBR would come in around £140bn, which would be £20bn above the targeted £120bn.""

Given that we live in a country which gets cold and therefore relies upon gas to stop our old people becoming OAPopsicles in the winter then I'm happy for the consumers (since that's almost everyone) so pay for it. It makes no difference whether you refer to them as consumers or taxpayers from that angle.

I don't believe in free trade to the ends of the earth so I would have the gas back in the hands of the taxpayer.

But in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up – and you don't have enough money to pay your debts.

&gt;""The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of experiments which show this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF,"" he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. ""So we know what will happen: economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know – it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT and went into another recession.""

&gt;Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by ideology; the national deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market only cares about one thing – getting repaid. And because other European governments are panicking because of the market's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want to be next.

I disagree with the view point, and I think it is a miserable stance. I reserve the right express my distaste.

Firstly, someone else has already suggested Los Cardos for a veggie haggis burrito. I second (or by now maybe third or fourth or fifth) that recommendation, and say seriously, don't bother going anywhere else for a burrito in Edinburgh. Los Cardos is The Place for burritos.

Secondly, I'd highly recommend Indaba, near Toll Cross. It's a tapas place that does a mix of Spanish, South American, and South African dishes (and some Scottish ones too - you can also get veggie haggis here as a tapas dish here). I believe they have a selection of veggie tapas dishes, and they're very friendly and welcoming.

Thirdly, if you fancy Italian food while you're here, go to Al Dente on Easter Road. They're a very traditional Italian place with a variety of pasta and meat dishes. Some of the pastas are fish pastas, and I believe are delicious, and some of the starters are veggie friendly. If that selection works for you, there's no better Italian food in the city imo. Their dishes are all very fresh, very filling, and very delicious.

Lastly, I don't know what their menu looks like at the moment but if you want to splash out a bit, go to the Kitchin. As a starred place I suspect they'll have a range of veggie options as well, and seriously, if I could eat regularly at that place, I would.

Once people start interpreting they stop being religious in any intellectually serious sense. The second a person says ""Well that bit doesn't really count"" they're no different than me qualitatively, they've rejected parts of the ""word of god"", and become merely deistic, instead of religious. The only difference between me and them is that I've gone the extra mile and rejected the entire thing, while they've just rejected parts of it. Any rejections breaks down the whole thing though, so they cease to be serious about their religion.

Yes, I realise that I am saying that the only religious people who're serious are fundamentalists. This is indeed what I am saying, and I sincerely believe it to be true.

Of course, they are then unpopular as they make decisions which make life even harder for the average person by cutting spending/selling national services (eg british gas, BT) and other policies to help solve the debt problem.

I mean, I honestly wouldn't blame them if they did it for the right reasons, but they just hop on every train they can. 
A prime example of this was May 21st.
The first day back at school since we won the CL. I wore my Chelsea jersey to show pride and finally make some of my Arsenal fans friends and aquantainces shut the fuck up. I go to school and all of a sudden, everyone, even the fuckers who have never watched a freaking game, and I doubt that they even watched the final, much less crap themselves from the anticipation and have a heart attack. All of a sudden, those guys were ""Chelsea fans."" Suddenly, they were all saying how Drogba(They mispronounced his name too) was such a beast and how he was the best player that Chelsea has ever had and how next season he's going to score more than any other player. It just pissed me the fuck off, man. They didn't know that his contract was up, they didn't know how to pronounce his name, they didn't know that Chelsea, I think, has had better players than him before, although they were right about him being a beast and legend. 
Things like that honestly piss me off so much, it just drives me crazy.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"I'm not. Likewise, I hope you're not so sensitive that you'd get upset if I called you a miserable wanker for doing the complaining! Although, it does seem you're quite upset by that.

I'm merely expressing the opinion that going around shouting ""this is shit!"" is a lose-lose situation. The people that want the Olympics stand to lose if people are doing that, and the people that don't want the Olympics have got nothing to gain either, because the Olympics are going ahead no matter what now. So it just seems a bit like, well if I can't enjoy it, nobody will! It's completely counter productive. It does nothing. It can only have a negative effect. Nothing positive whatsoever can come out of that approach. And that's why I think it's a miserable approach.

I mean it's fine, complain as you will, that's cool. But there's a lot of us that are incredibly optimistic about the games, some of us feel like it's the sort of lift the country could do with. There are so many people with high hopes for so many reasons. So when some people are determined to plough on with the message that the games are shit and refuse to let festivities ensue without snide comments, and we're the centre of the world's attention where the right exposure could do us wonders, we could make our Island proud and show the world what we are capable of (Incredibly optimistic I know, but this is why I accuse you of misery), the nay sayers could actually detract from the evident, by giving the world the wrong impression of us and destroying the atmosphere out of sheer spite, then you have to understand that a lot of people will think you are a miserable hate filled wanker who just wants to spoil it for everyone because you're determined to be proved right.

You know what I like about things like this, it's not the sport, it's not competition, it's not what it will do for the economy, it's not even being on the world stage. It's when huge groups of people from all different cultures are all pulling in the same direction, for a common purpose. When the whole world comes together to share in a common, primitive interest. It's always been something that I really enjoy. It may be for very arbitrary reasons, but when a massive group of people come together for the same goal, and are all on the same level, there's something magical about it that has always massively appealed to me. Even at just a small rave I can be in awe of this phenomenon. And it's happening right now, there's a carnival going on in my home town, just down the road from where I live, and the whole fucking world is invited.

And you're more than welcome to get involved, the fun really starts tomorrow. And I get that it may not be your cup of tea. That's fair enough. But it's happening now, no matter what you say or do. So anything you say or do against the Olympics can only really serve to detract from the positive feelings and optimism that a lot of us have. And that's fine, you can do that. That's the beauty of living in a democratic country like this. But please be aware, that it's nothing personal, it's not the end of the world, but if you're going to be bringing happy, optimistic, excited people down, just out of negativity, even though you stand to gain nothing from it, and I stress again this is nothing personal, then a lot of people are going to think you are being a miserable wanker. And I would be inclined to agree with them. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. You'll get through it. By September you'll just be a normal person again.

true,ryansoper,english,Surrey,"Right I may be a little Biased,  but one thing I learnt when I studied economics and what I've heard from the veterans here who have been around since the end of nationalisation is that before the gas network had been privatised the Gas board was horribly inefficient as they weren't there to make a profit they weren't worried about the costs they incurred, apparently they got a very good pension under nationalisation, but I doubt if the Gas Board still existed that the pension would be quite so good.
The truth of the matter is, at least from where I'm viewing the company, is that the majority of management do actually want to right for the customers and there is a big drive to become a well trusted household name that you can call and ask some questions and we'll come sort it out for you. I wouldn't be surprised if you see this huge profit recycled some way in the form of price cuts or increased spending on Green technologies (Like Solar Panels, Wind Farms ETC) a lot of which is subsidised massively for customers.
In Conclusion, I don't think the state of our current government could support the Gas network as well, seeing as they were about to hand part of policing over to G4S and that the NHS basically now employs private healthcare firms to do its work, Nationalisation is a thing that gets done in times of boom I think to be honest, when the government has money to burn, and even then some would be in two minds as to whether Nationalisation is such a good idea.",0,1343306879,null,0,false,0,c5jnqll,t3_x6k21,t1_c5jnqll,t3_x6k21,null,1429474127,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

All blood that is donated is tested for the presence of HIV and other diseases, but this has a margin of error and will provide both false positives and false negatives.

Never said that at all, and that's quite the extrapolation from simply seeing my views on the anti-olympics circlejerk. I'm just so bored of it. 

&gt;I don't expect people to fall in line with shit I say, i'd be surprised if they did, but I won't go around calling people wanker, a baby or miserable if they don't, like you do. 

It's really not that big of a deal. You don't like the Olympics. Fine, keep slating them. But I'm going to slate you for slating them. It's all part of the same mechanism, except you've the hump that I'm using my right to complain against you. It's a big lump of hypocrisy.

I'm not saying you're an out and out wanker, but in regard to the games, I think you are being a bit of a miserable wanker. And this is Britain mate, the odd insult is pretty much obligatory. If we were in a pub, discussing this, I'd call you a miserable wanker and you wouldn't think anything of it.

I'm not debating anything here. I'm simply stating that it's fine if you are against the Olympics. You have a right to express your opinion. Not sure why you are haranguing me for expressing mine. Seems like a huge double standard. Even if I withdraw the insulting word wanker, (which I apologise for but it seems to be a vital part of the discussion now), you still seem to take issue with me calling you miserable. Which is ridiculous. So you can slate the Olympics, cool. But if I call you out for being miserable on that basis, you get the hump and start calling me intolerant.

How can you justify that? It's ridiculous.

First of all capitalism is seen as a self-regulating system (not in the sense of ""government regulation"" but in the managerial meaning of the term). High profits driven by decreased supply or increased demand of a good or service would incentivise inward investment into the sector to produce more. Likewise the opposite istrue, low profits due to high production or low demand moves investment away. You have to remember when reading headlines like ""British gas owner makers £1.9 million a day"" that A: this incentivise investment into the sector and, more importantly B: Profit is not a pile of money rich people sit on. Profit is invested back into the system in one form or another. This has largely been seen as a success which is why all 3 of the main political parties are for keeping the status quo. The UK has the lowest natural gas price in the EU- http://fantazzini.narod.ru/gas.html#natgas as a result of privatized gas 

Secondly, at the time it was seen as a good way to fragment power. A a monopoly on the market in any way, shape or form was seen as a potential thread to the energy supply. The unions abused their power continually in the 70s and there was huge pressure at the time to find a way of stopping them having so much. Privatization was seen as a solution to this.

Thirdly- the timing. The 1980s was an ideal time for that thisof politics to arise. There was a hefty influx of educated youth entering the real world who wanted a greater opportunity to make a way for themselves. The freedom to own property, the pursuit of your own happiness and the power of the market were all very appealing ideas to the youth of that time. Influential academics such as Friedmen and Hayek popularized the idea of modern capitalism in the political and public imagination

Privatization is a mixed bag, you have to look at things on a case-by-case basis and truly understand why things are setup the way they are. Capitalism isn't an evil system, it simply accepts the nature of humans to follow their own self-interests and attempts to build an intelligent system around it. It is tempting to look at your electricity or gas bill and say to yourself ""wow, if it was government run, they could use tax money to build new power stations"", but that's the point in capitalism- it attempts to reach an equilibrium on supply and demand",0,1343308852,null,0,false,0,c5jo3n2,t3_x6k21,t1_c5jo3n2,t3_x6k21,null,1429474297,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As he says, he hasn't felt like he's been given a chance since Benitez left and I can see why based on the football we've tried to play since.  He fits much better in a Rodgers system and hopefully he'll finally get a chance to show everyone (in England at least) again why he cost £20m.

true,AndorianBlues,k9,K-9,"I've been watching the TV Movie DVD extras lately, and the picture it paints is of a very driven American producer (Philip Segal), marred by an essentially unworkable amount of management. Two BBC divisions, Universal, Fox and Amblin all had some say in the project, and it really felt like nothing really good would've ever come out of that process.

I think it shows.. McGann, Ashbrook and Yee Jee Cho were all fine, Roberts was okay, but the story itself is really lacking. It feels like a pastiche of what Doctor Who was, with some ""American"" action sequences. There's actually very *little* of McGann's Doctor. The best scene he gets is banging the console at the end, the rest of the movie is inexplicably concerned with McCoy and severe post-regenerative stress. Having a more mature McCoy was cool, seeing him without that silly question mark sweater, sure. But for a movie that's supposed to intrudoce this to the American audience.. why is he there? Even worse, the BBC insisted on having Tom Baker play the old Doctor, which would've destroyed continuity.

true,charlamagnum,null,null,"yup i kinda think so too. The way they played was different and Kenny brought in some other midfielders that maybe were just unlucky? Kenny had some high expectations on them all and im sure if they wouldn't of been as lackluster or if kenny would of realized this sooner and maybe had some form of consequences for some players who played bad they would of played better.

I think that everyone felt comfortable at keeping their position under kenny. He is a good manager i still think that his focus on week to week games was superb. But he didnt really threaten any players to the bench and i think that he should of at least to some.

And having said that i do realize he tried changing formations and starting line ups...but he usually kept the same rotations he didnt introduce any youth players to step up.

Because grownups can recognise that it's just a word and that it's the legal rights and recognition which are important and not a term, and the LGBT community has traditionally been more grown up and mature than the religious community, which practically by definition is required to be in an infantile state of reverence and blind duty at all times.

As I've said, I argue for full equality in non-religious couples, straight or gay.

Says anybody with common sense?

I'm not hating on religion, because the older faiths (if we're keeping it Abrahamic) have some legitimacy because they were created in a time before modern science, and have existed for hundreds, and some cases thousands of years.

But Mormonism is like some kind of bizarre christian fan fiction. Mormons believe that they become gods when they die, and that the Garden of Eden is somewhere in the USA (virginia I think). Mormonism was also a racist organisation which until 1972 did not allow black people to be part of it.

This means that Romney was part of an organisation that held racism as part of it's very *doctrine*.

&gt;which started where? 

America and London in 2008 when all the toxic debt became worthless. It had been going on for years.

&gt;and how are they getting on now?

About as well as any other western nation right now.

&gt;how has unemployment shifted under Obama?

In four years it has gone up by 0.1%

That's pretty excellent considering before the banking collapse it was a similar number to what it is currently.

&gt;He is likely going to continue the policies of Obama who continued the policies of Bush. So, no difference

As a punishment for him raping two of his employees, he's fitted with electric pants which shock his penis whenever he gets an erection.  He forces Moss to adjust them while they're still on his body, and loudly comments on everything that gives him an erection for the next few episodes.

Reddit apparently loves the show regardless, so I'm done talking about it.  I loved that show, I laughed like an idiot and sent clips to all my friends.

Oh come off it, it's spent at least the last 1500 years being an absolutely religious thing, lets not kid ourselves. There have been unions for a very very long time, but marriage has been a primarily religious institution for a very long time itself.

&gt;Their complaint is that they do not see same-sex relationships as comparable to opposite-sex relationships, and do not want them to be treated equivalently by the government.

Well, fuck that. Equal rights for all and to hell with what that lot think about it.

&gt;(would religious marriage still be legally recognised, and would religious groups be allowed to offer same-sex marriage if they wanted to?)

Why bother legally recognising it? Why not have it similar to any other superstitious institution whereby you get the secular legal stuff out the way in the morning and then do the hocus pocus stuff in the afternoon? That's what most faiths do. Marriage could be a purely religious ceremony. Seems like the optimum outcome to me.

**Passing**

+) ball over the top

+) really nice ball over the top, but offside

+) swing possession just outside the box to out left

+) chip pass to the corner

+) cutting pass through the back line of the defense


-) pass to spearing was lazy and a hospital ball... spearing really mucked it up though

-) cross/longball to the left was floated and forced. went straight to the defender

-) overlap with Enrique out of bounds

-) pass to cole... another hospital ball

-) longball to cole... forced, unnecessary loss of possession


**Tackles (obviously not his specialty)**

+) had a nice sliding tackle back on D in the box


-) backed out of the tackle avoided collision

-) backed out of the tackle

-) backed out of the tackle


**Movement**
For the most part he creates space and his movement is good. There were multiple times though his positioning was poor or he was caught ball watching. 


**Shot**

-) One very poor speculative effort from far out... unnecessary loss of possession


**Other**

Canonically, I think the Doctor sounds British because that's how he's always sounded. It's a part of who he is as much as that he's always been a white male. This is not to say it could or would not change...he could by all chances become a black female southern-US Doctor, but it's so far from who he is that it's not going to happen.  
I think if they wanted to explore alternate Doctor possibilities they could go back to his DoctorDonna clone in an alternate universe, where there is likely to be an actual alternate Doctor buzzing around the universe somewhere. Interesting thought, that.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Some passages from the bible can (and have been) used to prevent mixed race marriage. As the notion is now so antithetical to public thinking, most people don't even understand how it could have once been that way.

This is kinda my point really. By the government just allowing same-sex marriage to happen, but not telling religions they has to do them, the issue of churches refusing to do marry same-sex couples will be solved by societies views changing over time. To me it's actually hard to fathom how it was possible that little under 2 decades before I was born it was illegal for a mixed race couple to marry in [parts of] the US. Yet I fully expect that a child born around 2030 will find the concept of same-sex marriages being illegal just as alien when they are an adult. 

&gt; My own solution to this problem would be grant a marriage licence for anyone who wants to perform any type of marriage, but deny it to those that would discriminate. With regards to the CoE, this would mean that the government isn't essentially advocating discrimination of homosexuals (or anyone else). I imagine a good many CoE churches would happily marry gays, so it shouldn't really be a problem.

The issue with the CoE is that even if it's legal, they have gay members of the congregation who want to marry and both the congregation and priest would love to see them do so in their church, the CoE has expressly forbidden this. It is the same case with allowing civil partnership ceremonies in churches, or even something as simple as blessing the newlyweds who've done the entire ceremony in another location. So your stance would effectively deny the entire CoE the right to perform marriages, and that's a the state vs religion (always something to avoid). 

It's quite natural to want to find ways to force the church to change it's mind, but this will only get peoples backs up. If you actually look at the data, the majority of the UK population is either in favor or doesn't really care, leaving an ever decreasing minority who oppose it. And the same pattern is repeated in the Anglican congregation according to [this survey](http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2012/what-anglicans-and-others-think-about-homosexuality-and-disestablishment/), with only slightly more than a 3rd of Anglicans being against same-sex marriage in '07 compared to 70% in '83. So there is no need to force the change, only a need to create an environment where same-sex marriage can become a normal part of society. If you do this then the CoE won't change it's actions as quickly as you might like, but I can guarantee that it will change it's views on gay marriage far more quickly.

*Greenaway by Peter Anghelides*

&gt;A man named Greenaway lives in a single room overlooking the sea, and does not want to leave. From time to time, the Doctor visits him, each time with a different appearance, and each time tries to convince him to leave the room. Each time, Greenaway politely declines. The various Doctors try reasoning with him, cajoling him, and even bustling him out of the room to meet his daughter before she goes away. The Eighth Doctor even tells him the truth, that this is a telepathic conversation and that Greenaway is stuck inside his own head. Greenaway’s village was attacked by an alien monster, and he helped the First Doctor and Steven to fight it off, but at great cost. Greenaway still does not want to remember or to leave the room. **Finally, a red-haired Doctor in an afghan coat** sadly informs Greenaway that he’s been in the room too long; his life-support machines can no longer keep his damaged body alive and his mind doesn’t want to make the effort. The Doctor leaves, and the room begins to fade away, but as Greenaway slips away, he finally finds it within himself to struggle to consciousness out of the coma he’s been trapped in for so many years. As he begins the slow process of recovery, however, he wonders whether this is really what the Doctor intended to happen when he switched off Greenaway’s life-support systems.

He was already in Italy. 

What Seeqer was saying was that the papers said Aquilani **wanted to leave**.

&amp;gt;A loan is being discussed, and I didn't want to use him against Trabzonspor in case it goes through. This season, it's very important Aquilani plays regular football and is the first name on the team sheet every week. That was the intention when he came here as a very expensive signing.

&amp;gt;But with Steven Gerrard, Javier Mascherano and Joe Cole in the ranks, it's going to be very hard for me to say, ""You'll always be the first name on the team sheet"".

&amp;gt;'He'd then risk not getting enough games for a second successive season, and if that happened, his value would diminish vastly. Most importantly, he would also be very unhappy.

&amp;gt;'After last year, when he came here injured and hardly played, it would be a disaster for him to have another season of hardly any football. If he can get regular games for a top Serie A team, it will give him the football he needs and protect his value.

Quote from Hodgson. Full article [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1304688/Juventus-join-chase-Liverpools-Alberto-Aquilani-line-swap-deal-Felipe-Melo.html)



&amp;gt;“It’s a great move for Alberto. He’s got his wife and kid over there. It was difficult for him here.” 

&amp;gt;“When he came back his pre-season training was excellent. We gave him a few games, he did well in those games. But the problem for us was trying to get him in the team. We couldn’t get him in the team.

&amp;gt;“Obviously everybody wants to play and Alberto is moving over to a fantastic football club. He goes there with the best wishes of everyone and we hope it works out for him, because he was never a problem in any way, shape or form.”

Yes, you're right. Aquilani didn't WANT to leave, but was rather loaned out by Hodgson. I can agree that Hodgson for some reason didn't want to give him a chance, but I don't think that was the case with Dalglish. He was quoted during his caretaker time as saying he would love to have Aqua back. During pre-season last year (aqua played very well throughout the tour), Dalglish continued to say he would like Aqua to stay. The rumors during this time were again his inability to settle in England (girlfriend?) and that he would have a better chance to get into the Italian Euro squad if he played in Italy. 

The only issue I really have with Aquilani is his seemingly bad attitude towards LFC. There were always rumors about his adaptation to England, and once he went on loan, he made it very evident he wanted to stay in Italy. That's fine, sometimes it doesn't work out. But now that he can't go anywhere in Italy because they won't pay for him, he suddenly refutes two year old claims of his inability to settle and reveals how he was ""forced out"" on loan? A bit too good of a time for Aquilani to reveal such truths, no? I'm just tired of this saga.

I'm sorry, but if it's been out there for OVER A YEAR, it's not a spoiler. If you haven't caught up by then, that's not MY fault. Doctor Who seasons span a really long time.

I enjoy having a group of like-minded people to talk to, but your policies seem to be extreme. The 48 hour policy, great, that makes perfect sense. But season 6 should not be a spoiler to anyone at this point. Especially not the first half (which has been up on netflix for QUITE some time).

Granted, it is unkind to expect a lot from an 18-year old Lukaku, but he did come into the club with a lot of fanfare. His Belgian counterpart, one similarly aged Thibaut Courtois realized that his first team ops were going to be severely imited and he promptly jumped at Atletico's offer. Look at him now. 

Lukaku was star-struck by Drogba and wanted to be around him. Understandable. But, his progress in the reserves hasn't been all that spectacular either. Plus, he made it pretty clear he did not want to waste his time by going out on loan. Whether that was smart, or over-confidence on his part, or simply a stupid mistake, only time will tell. 

So, tell me, what do you do with an 18-year old, who isn't performing in the reserves but doesn't want to be loaned out either? What do you do if he - in spite of all that strength - often seems like a fish out of water in (what is, arguably) one of the most physical leagues in the world of soccer? He may be a prolific 18-year old in the Jupiler League, but can he replicate that kind of performance on a cold, windy Friday night at the Britannia stadium? 

I kept getting the feeling that Lukaku always considered himself too good for the reserves and too good to be loaned out. It may or may not have been the case, in reality. However, in his desperate (ego-fuelled) bid for first-team soccer only and only at the team he loves, he forgot one of the most basic truths of life: ""When you don't want to go anywhere, you go nowhere.""

Faction Paradox, who are involved in a prolonged war with the Timelords, infect the Doctor's 3rd incarnation with something that changes his DNA slowly with no obvious effects till his 6th to 7th incarnation.  In fact they cause the 3rd Doctor to regenerate prematurally on a planet called Dust (via shot gun wound) instead of on Earth due to the radiation damage from the Planet of Spiders.  Apparently the events as shown in the tv series would go as normal, but the behaviour of the Doctor gets more erratic with each regeneration.  The end result is to make the Doctor an agent of Faction Paradox, who are mostly Terran for some reason.

One of Dalglish's biggest faults were his adamant support of players regardless of what the situation.

Despite what Hodgson had said and what his intention might have been with Aqua, Hodgson was kicked out shortly after his (terrible) reign at LFC began, so Aqua has no excuses after that. Dalglish wanted him at LFC and had said that numerous times while Aqua was still at Juve. Why should he remain loyal? Because it's a different manager and person, and because he's under LFC contract. The contract means you have to be loyal to the club, does it not? 

I could even agree that maybe he doesn't need to be loyal, but he sure as hell shouldn't try to convince players from his parent club to join his loan club.

I think it's great [that we've got a worldwide fan base].

I've found their knowledge is second to none.

Being a 'plastic' Scouser we've got loads of supporters here that are fair weather supporters that will only support the team when times are good.

And like somebody has already said, I don't think in the last 3/4 years we've had to worry about glory hunters!

It's not about where you're from, it's about how you support the team. Just because I go the game fairly often doesn't make me a better supporter than anyone else, in fact there's plenty of people that have never set foot inside Anfield, who have a more rounded knowledge of the club than I have, or ever will have. And with all the social media on the Internet now, supporting your club isn't just singing from the terraces any more.

Liverpool FC is like a family, and the more the merrier. It's great going to the game and chatting to anyone there. The last season alone I've spoken to some Norwegian (not helping the stereotype any!), Dutch, German, Indonesian and Chinese. It just shows how fantastic and fanatical the support of the club is with people willing to spend huge amounts of money and travel thousands of miles to watch the red men.

The more the merrier, and YNWA to you all!

Network Rail makes massive ""profits"". I live in Cornwall. The rail network gets the bare minimum investment to stop trains crashing into each other or falling off the track. Same trains since the 80s, same signalling system since the railway came into the county (at least early 1900s), still the same pretty slow line speeds. Meanwhile the same places get the same rolls-royce treatment they have always had.

Meanwhile BT (with EU and council part funding) has already given me fibre to the cabinet broadband, South West Water has ripped out and replaced the water mains with new pipes, and my local electricity distribution company and the National Grid seem to have invested enough to ensure the lights don't go out. If we believe the South West Water guff, a lot of the things they've done are because the nationalised water board could/would not do it.

While the mobile networks were never privatised, at least 3 out of the 5 networks have bothered to give my county a decent level of 3G service and one of those companies is trialling 4G not far from me.

I do, however, accept the research that shows exposure to violent media makes you more likely to respond aggressively to situations.

I'd like to point out, while we're citing studies, that [10% of men will admit to rape as long as you don't use the word ""rape""](http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/).  The problem with rape jokes is that they normalize the view of rape.  People don't even understand what rape even *is*, and that's why rape is not perpetuated solely by crazy people with psychological problems.  Rape and sexual assault are perpetrated by close friends, ex lovers, *current* lovers, coworkers, roommates, and acquaintances.  The myth of a psycho with a knife in a dark alley is not based in reality.
