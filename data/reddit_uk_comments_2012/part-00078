true,cybergibbons,null,null,"&gt;Children may be in hiding from someone in particular, who already knows what they look like. A photograph of a child in their school uniform gives the location of their school, making them MUCH easier to find. They don't really need their locations broadcast on the internet.

This doesn't make any sense. A child has been moved to a new school, to protect them from someone, which relies on them not being found. Conjecture, but I am presuming they have moved home as well, as otherwise they would be easy to find. 

Are you supposing that the person they are being protected from is looking at every photo on the internet taken by a parent at every school in the hope they find the child? 

How is a photo on the internet having ""their locations broadcast""? 

&gt;In order that the children who were under protection were not identified to other parents, a school wide photography ban was put into place.

&gt;You would want ALL parents to know which child is 'on the run', so to speak?

I'm not sure I get what you mean by not ""identified to other parents"". Do you mean:

1. The other parents cannot work out the former identity of the children being protected.
2. The other parents cannot work which children are being protected

Regardless, I don't see how an outright photography ban achieves this.

For 1, the parents can see the children with their own eyes and work out who they are. There is no need for a photograph.

For 2, the parents can infer which children are protected by their absence from any official photographs.

It's an incredibly difficult task to protect the identity of a child. It's not easy to explain why to them. Even something as simple as a surname change is challenging for a child to deal with. Losing all your old friends even more so. But there are far, far bigger risks to their safety than appearing in another parent's photos on the internet. It's disturbingly easy to find out which school a child goes to by making phone calls.

It shows maturity, and is commendable that Lukaku recognizes that he did not contribute in the CL, and thus doesn't deserve (nor want) a medal, or to lift the trophy. I empathize with him bc clearly he wants to play, and it must be hard to adjust from starting 98 matches, to now playing just a few reserve matches, and a handful of substitute apps. 

That being said, the club really was handcuffed with Romelu. As mentioned before, we could not loan him out, which left him stuck at the bottom of the pecking order behind Drogs, Torres and Sturridge. His frustration is understandable. What's important is what is done with him from here.

At this point, I myself have been a little disappointed with how we've brought along our young talent. With the likes of Mceachran, Lukaku, Piazon, Romeu, Feruz etc. we have a plethora of young talent with loads of potential. We have to find opportunities for these players to play at higher level. The reserves are not good enough. In addition to loaning these players out, we compete in 6 (or is it 7?) different competitions next season. These players MUST be used in some capacity. They need an opportunity to prove their worth and improve at a high level. Otherwise our efforts to sign young talent will have all been in vain.

Look I understand youve just discovered that you can be an atheist and you want to hate on all religious figures, but youre picking on the wrong guy.

Read what he says an you'll quickly come to realise that actually, no, he's not homophobic, yes he is anti-choice for various SANE reasons, yes he is anti euthanasia again for entirely SANE reasons, and no he is not ""anti democracy"". As for being a traitor, well, I dont even know what he's being a traitor against.

Do you know why the arguments about Euthanasia and Abortion are so difficult and mixed up, its not because of religion, its because the both are of them are on massively shaky ground from a moral sense. Just because youve come to a different conclusion than someone doesn't mean they're bad. 

Plenty of very intelligent people are anti euthanasia, plenty of very intelligent people are anti abortion, especially beyond a certain trimester.

EDIT: As for your homophobic concept of the guy, a simple look at his wiki page provides quotes demonstrating his complete non fear of gay people, and thats a wiki page showing a few quotes, not the reams of texts he has wrote.


But okay, you carry on dumbing down intelligent view points to suit your own needs. 

Or maybe you could be clever and stop talking about one of the great thinkers of our age like he is a misguided child.

true,tinyphotographer,tennant,Tennant,"Bad Wolf began in the very first episode of the relaunch; the Nestene Consciousness uttered the phrase to the Doctor, although it wasn't very clear (it was re-dubbed in the DVD release) you can see it mouthing the words. In the second episode it is again mentioned (""Indubitably, this is the Bad Wolf scenario"") after which it appears in every episode of the season (spray painted on the TARDIS in Aliens of London/World War Three, spray painted on a poster in Father's Day, name of a bomb in The Doctor Dances, etc...). 

When Rose is sent back to modern London, she is struggling with the idea that the Doctor is fighting the Daleks alone and potentially losing. While sitting on a bench with Mickey, she sees Bad Wolf painted on the ground. Earlier in the episode, the Doctor muses over what bad wolf could mean as he has noticed it appearing every where they go. Rose sees it as a sign that she needs to get back to the Doctor. Blah blah blah, absorbs the time vortex, you know all that. 

When Rose absorbs the time vortex she acquires godlike power, most importantly, she has ""omnipotent reality warping abilities."" She takes the words Bad Wolf from a sign in Satellite 5 and scatters it through her past, and all of reality, to guide herself to this outcome, ensuring that she looks into the heart of the TARDIS and saves the Doctor's life. 

To sum up, Bad Wolf is a clue for Rose scattered through out reality by Rose herself. It is meant to, as Neko said, ""make sure the right path is taken during non-fixed points."" It can also be seen as a warning from Rose that danger is approaching. ",0,1340578089,null,0,false,0,c551kxf,t3_vjgq6,t1_c551kxf,t3_vjgq6,null,1429220505,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

He totally agrees with the immorality of the scheme. He has apologised and stopped using it. He made a mistake by not checking where his money was going, but he assumed the accountants would deal with it. It is a mistake. How is it hard to believe that humans make mistakes all of a sudden?

I also think Hendo could have helped solve a lot of our problems with regards to keeping the ball, he is an excellent passer, something we lacked in central midfield (and going forward full stop).

Neither did they go on national TV and say they were in the wrong and made an error of judgement like Jimmy did. 

My point is that he had the balls to admit a mistake, whilst MPs do not. They dance around the problem till they bore the audience to death. They never admit mistakes.

Also, the vast majority of expenses were actually illegal. It is illegal to claim for something that is actually not an expense incurred by the job from which you are claiming the expenses. For example, if I claimed a bird bath table (like some did) for my expenses as an MP for whatever constituency I work for. It is hardly an item I need to be able to perform my job and is therefore illegal. It is an abuse of contract at the very least and therefore allows you to be dismissed from your post.

So you would go to America to perform a job that is basically enforcing the issue we are talking about here? Bloody hell. England truly has become a training ground for Americas grunts. 

The reason you want to do as long as possible in the Royal Marines is because the UK is a decent country to fight and work for. You'd rather work in the RM than anywhere else.

Can you honestly say you would be happy working as security for lets say the flight of Gary McKinnon to the US? He is a disabled man with autism who happens to have the genius to crack into NASAs computer system. Instead of branding him a criminal the US should be employing him in cyber security. Yet you would have him put in prison?

The same goes for O'Dwyer. Instead of arresting him, Google or Microsoft should employ him as a young man who can set up an incredibly effective search website on his own. 

The US is only a friend of the UK as long as we provide a service that helps to protect their own national interest. As soon as we become useless, they don't care. Libya is a case in point. They helped out at the start when it suited and then withdrew support as the fighting went on. We got left with only European support.

Also, I'd point you towards the example of David Laws, who had an unconventional arrangement to avoid disclosing that he lived with his partner. Through this he accumulated £50,000 over five years, which was equivalent to the expenses he would otherwise have been able to claim had he been simply claiming rent on a second home in the conventional way.

Brown was widely pilloried in the press because he, as Prime Minister, claimed for a cleaner.

Indeed it does. When we consider for a moment that in the very same week that Carr is found out in the press, so is Gary Barlow. They are essentially doing the same thing. Yet because Barlow is more popular, a singer in Take That, and helped in the Queens Jubilee - he is exempt from scorn. I still don't understand why his tax avoidance died away so suddenly when Carr's shot to the top of national conscience.

They are all as bad as each other. I am not defending Carr, however he has some redeeming features that Barlow and the MPs do not.

I think we should have played 4-3-1-2 (or even 4-1-2-1-2).  Played 3 central midfielders, rooney behind carroll and either wellbeck/young/walcott.  It would have suited the players we have better. The fullbacks will provide the width, and it means we have a central midfield and maybe a chance of keeping the ball.

Rooney is a quality player through and through, he didn't have a great tournament though, i think he falls in the same trap Gerrard often does when playing for England in trying to do too much, which ends up dropping him deeper and so he isnt there on the end of the balls where we want him.

But you're right in saying the 4-4-2 was never properly equipped for Italy's packed midfield - it's just that there's not much to be done about it this time.

The wingers got pulled inside to help out in the centre; given how narrow Hodgson's midfield four are, that's OK, and it put the onus on Cole &amp; Johnson to provide width which they're both happy to do.

For me, the biggest tactical problem was Rooney doing a good imitation of Malouda. It's his job to drop deep and pick up Pirlo (Hodgson had both his CM's sitting deep, and replacing Parker with Henderson wouldn't have changed that), and he didn't bother.

That's when I had the idea of contacting a company to have it custom made.  It was too expensive to get the whole cube done, so I went ahead and had just a single segment done (which was still quite expensive).

I still have hopes of having the whole cube done, but probably not unless I can convince a bunch of other people to do it as well so as to get a discount.  We'll see what happens.

If I get the whole thing done, I promise to post more pics!  :)

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"&gt;if we had bought an adequate strike partner for him, someone that fit the system we would have performed a lot better ... Infact two years later we're still searching for that Striker.

The blame for us not buying the type of striker we've needed in the last three years falls as much, if not more, on Levy's shoulders as it does Redknapp's. That summer was when we should have pushed the boat out but Levy wouldn't loosen the purse strings when he should have. We've been paying for that for the last two seasons. You really think Redknapp wasn't trying to sign a striker that summer?

&gt; settling for 4th as you seem to be happy to.

I'm not happy to ""settle for fourth spot""; we were 5 points of the top of the table at the end of December 2010.

&gt;Your facts are all wrong with Bale, he was free from injury to play in the 5-0 Win against Burnley on September 26th. He finally got his chance on January 2nd, over 3 months later. There were no further injuries inbetween. 

Just because Bale played in September doesn't mean he was fit. He patently wasn't; he was seen a few times over the first half of that season and each time showed he was still struggling to get back to full fitness.

He suffered a horrendous hamstring injury, the sort of thing that often takes players a long time to bounce back fully from - the same thing happened last season (10/11) when he had a recurrence around December. The injury only kept him out of the team for a month or so but he was never the same player for the final four months of the season because it took him so long to get back to 100%, just as before.

Whern he first came into the team the year before because BAE was injured he was finally at a point where he was properly fit enough to make a contribution. He had in no way been wrongly overlooked for months.

&gt;Credit for playing a central midfielder in the centre, and a young, defensively weak, but offensively strong left back on the wing? It didn't exactly take a genius to work it out.

Really? Modric was a central midfielder? The guy who'd played as a number 10 in Croatia, spent two years as a narrow left mid for us, and was largely derided as being to small for the rough and tumble of the PL, to the point where a few other managers had publically stated that as their reason for not trying to sign him? You think it was a natural choice to throw him into a central pair, something Redknapp deserves no credit for trying? Sorry, you're wrong.

And please reel off a list for me of other full-backs who've been successfully moved up to the wing. It's not really that common and we could easily have been playing Kranjcar, our fully fit actual left midfielder in the role instead. Picking Bale there wasn't the easy or obvious option you make it out to be.

&gt;How was Redknapp criticised for those decisions? They immediately worked, Bale was MoM most weeks, Modric and Huddlestone were outstanding in central midfield.

Worked immediately? Here's the [report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8596807.stm) for the first match in which we tried it, a 3-1 defeat to Sunderland in which we were pretty generally overun across the pitch. It worked so well BAE was teken off at half-time, pulling Bale back to full-back. We were missing other players through injury, but the focus on the forums and in pubs and the stands was on the supposed absurdity of playing Modric in a central pair.

It was the Arsenal match, a week later and after the FA Cup semi defeat to Portsmouth (in which we had reverted to the old system with Modric out wide) that it was tried again and started working. There was plenty of room for criticism in that period, with Redknapp widely derided for throwing away our CL hopes by playing a lightweight in the centre at the SoL.

You're absolutely right that replacing Redknapp shows ambition and was the right move for improving the club, but credit where it's due. If we're going to criticise his time with us we should be criticising the numerous things he actually does deserve criticism for.",0,1340596044,null,0,1340630304,0,c555j7i,t3_vgit5,t1_c555j7i,t1_c54ubp7,null,1429222375,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

She's strong and competent, unlike The Doctor's previous companions, but she still has a human side and is not afraid to show her emotions. Donna is one of the strongest and most believable humans on the show and is the third best companion (the first and second best companions are Rory and Donna's grandfather respectively, obviously).

1. Hang outside the front of your local shop

3. Ask them to buy you some cigs and give them a tenner
4. Get any generic 20 deck, you don't really care you just want to ease your cravings.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"As someone who shows a similar lack of interest in the game, I'm probably not the person best qualified to answer, but I've found myself wondering the same thing all the same.  I was under the impression that the English Premier league was supposed to be one of the best in the World, if not the best.  Now admittedly, a significant number of people playing in the premier league are Johnny Foreigner and so we find ourselves playing against them in international competitions instead of with them.  But still, we must surely have some home grown talent among all those multi-millionaires.  Given the insane amount of money they all earn, I would expect them to perform slightly better than mediocre.  To my uneducated eye, Wayne Rooney didn't look like someone who should be earning a quarter of a million pounds a week for playing football.

One other thing that I'd like to get off my chest while I'm on the subject is the inability of these highly paid football players to kick a ball with either foot.  I play the piano (just for fun) and spend hours practicing to build up strength and dexterity in my weaker left hand.  A pianist who can't play with his or her left hand isn't a piano player at all.  But for some reason, it seems to be an acceptable excuse for a footballer to balls something up (pardon the pun) because it ""came to his wrong side"" or because he ""couldn't get it to his right foot"", according to the ""expert"" commentators.   What a pile of tosh.  My kids can kick a ball with either foot (as can I and I'm *rubbish* at football) so why can't the so-called professionals?

&gt;Many of the proponents seem to complain about the cost of the poor, as ""useless eaters"".

&gt;These same people never seem to complain about the rich, living on income from investments, who are not directly productive themselves.

&gt;The growth in inequality in Britain is mainly due to the fact that income from investments has grown so much faster than wages from productive work.

&gt;We could also mention how, to maximise investor income,industry has been shedding jobs, thus boosting the rate of unemployment.

&gt;The bank bailout is about supporting the value of investments, particularly bondholders in banks. To pay for this, the government has to cut welfare to the poor.

England have a good defence, some decent midfielders and 1 good striker. Overall there are perhaps 4 world class players in the team (Rooney, Gerrard, Cole and Terry). This is not a strong platform to win tournaments on.

This is the same issue that bugs England every tournament and every time no action is taken because people look at peripheral rather than core issues. The way English kids are trained in the game hasn't changed in decades but the game has changed dramatically.

England drastically need to look at what the Germans have done. There are a lot of parallels and the Germans were bumbling from tournament to tournament for a while on the back of 3/4 decent players and no meat.

true,brauchen,mcgann,McGann,"They don't. Or rather, they do in the novel ""Lungbarrow"", but that's not TV show canon. 

Some writers claim that Time Lords are asexual, other writers say that they can have half-human kids. The Doctor claimed to be half-human (on his mother's side) in the TV movie (which *is* part of the canon), but that's been ignored or handwaved away by most other writers. The comics stated that that claim was just a trick to confuse the Master. Big Finish continuity has it that Susan had a half-human kid; other stories have entirely different endings for her. In Paul Cornell's ""Scream Of The Shalka"", the Doctor and the Master are an item - not part of the canon, but it was a proper BBC production, not a parody or anything. Ten hints to Joan Redfern that he can be anything for her that a human could be, but doesn't make it explicit what he meant; Ten and the Virgin Queen... well, let's not get into that; River certainly likes to hint that she and Eleven are banging like rabbits, but of course we never see that happening. 

On a meta level: when the show started, writers just weren't allowed to have the Doctor be too friendly with women. It wasn't considered appropriate for kids. Five wasn't even allowed to hug his female companions most of the time. That all changed with Eight in the movie because the writers wanted to appeal to a more grownup audience, so Eight got to kiss his companion. Davies loved that idea and ran with it.

true,veea,english,Norwich,"I think its crazy, im starting work again after a year of caring for my parter as she had a severe injury to her back and was bedridden for a considerable time and is still in constant pain, all our savings got eaten up and we had to survive off benefits. 

My family lives so remotely there is no public transport or nearby docs/hospitals that could treat her and her family would not provide any support, the system served as a safety net and now that her condition has progressed to a point where 24/h care is not required I can return to work. This is only because i am living somewhere where work is available. 

If we were forced to move back home due to these benefit cuts, we wouldn't have been able to get the accessible level of care needed and the financial burden of 2 people, one with expensive health care costs would be a ruin for either family even if that was an option, this ignores the fact i have been financially independent for 5 years prior to this.

The money we have received was literally only enough to eat and live off. To be able to make do we have had to live very frugally, and i would not complain about the amount we received, it was exactly what was needed and no more, the system is a mess though, administration is chaos and im certain soo much tax payers money is wasted by people having to constantly call and overburden the system due to administration errors.

That being said the lifestyle option benefits gives to couples or mothers who do chose to pop kids out is too extravagant, the area we live in is full of people like that, the extra money is not spent on kids and the system is an insult to couples who do work and pay for their own children.

Cutting benefits to all under 25's would be a social disaster, and would truly create a class system where poor people really were kept down, only rich familys could support the over 18's in their first steps to independence or could afford the burden of serious health problems.

The basic rate for ESA/jobseekers is appropriate IMO, the focus should be on the extra awards and benefit loopholes that allows a lifestyle in excess of a working household for over 25's or for households that just churn out kids.

Put it this way, the reason drug laws fail is because addicts do not care, they simply want to stop the craving and they fundamentally don't care how, whether it's spending a couple of quid they shouldn't have, or whether it's robbing someones house to fund a dangerous addiction - if you have an addiction or had one, whether it's Tobacco, Heroin, Coke, Caffeine whatever - you'll know this feeling.

The same is principally true for young smokers, the way you start when you're young (at least for me, and everyone I know) is through peer pressure, your mates rob a packet of cigs off of their parents and you all go out to try one each, then you try a couple more over the next month, then another and by the time you know it, you have cravings to stasify. 

It's at this point that I considered brand, based on both packet appearance, price and quality of the smoke (harsh, smooth etc) but I can say with absolute 100% certainty had the packets been completely plain, I'd have simply ignored it and bought the cheapest pack of cigs I could. 

Having plain packets may disuade people to start smoking on their own, however it will not stop you being peer pressured into it, and I have to laugh at the thought if I'm honest.

""Mate! I robbed a 10 deck of my mum! wanna go smoke!?""

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"&gt; Cutting benefits to all under 25's would be a social disaster, and would truly create a class system where poor people really were kept down, only rich familys could support the over 18's in their first steps to independence or could afford the burden of serious health problems.

This never happened to me. I'm 25 now and I come from a very lower middle class background. My parents were never really that well off and never provided much financial assistance to me when I left home at 18 (and rightly so)

I think the bigger problem is education, I was the first from my family to go to university and I've benefitted immensely from that since graduating, getting a job and and settling into a (fairly) comfortable life.

Education opens doors to people, regardless of background, even if the richer kids get an easier push up the ladder, it's still a very meritocratic system. The problem arises when kids leave school at 16 and don't have the option of education because they've performed poorly in the system, that's when they get left on the scrapheap. Jobs that require little mental skill or experience (e.g. retail) are often low paid and I guess it makes more sense based on the current benefits system to just claim benefits instead -what's the point in working for Tesco when you could be at home?

The current (for under 25's) payments for 2 people is far far less than 2 minimum full time jobs, what we have received in the last year is roughly  4.5 k each (including housing benefit and remember ESA is a little more than job-seekers), working on minimum wage for 38 hours a week after tax deductions we would receive little over 10k per year each

Working minimum wage we would effectively double our income, every under 25 (without kids) ive spoken to feels forced into this situation and is applying to every job going, surviving on less than 5k a year is very tough and is not a situation you could feel comfortable in imo, but its doable if necessary but that's how a safety net should work. 

Once you are 25 the rates payable and what is available to claim increases dramatically, this needs to be addressed as it allows a lifestyle above the safety net standard, along with the kids allowances.

Jobs are very hard to come by, especially for those with little experience or some blot on their CV, if you tread down on the people who are struggling to find work, the disparity of wealth in this country will increase as well as the social problems associated with it. 

Most people would work if they could, it doubles your money!

When I've got a phone contract in the past all they've wanted is my address and bank details, so get those sorted first and you'll have no issues.

Not all networks lock their phones, you'd have to check when you buy it, also I know a lot of android phones are very easy to unlock, the SGS2 just involves downloading an app from the playstore.

All the major networks are pretty much the same but generally Three and O2 are cheap, orange and T-mobile slightly more expensive and Vodafone the most expensive. Just look on their websites to see what they offer, they all have shops on every high street they'll give you the same and sometimes slightly better than you get online, you can sometimes negotiate a little bit if you tell them what offers you've seen elsewhere. They all have good coverage over &gt;99% of the country, there's no issues with having to get a specific network in a specific area. 

From a purely value for money perspective you are best off getting a SIM from giffgaff, (they don't have shops, get one delivered to you from their website). Then buy what ever phone you want from [amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-SIII-Free-Smartphone/dp/B0080DJ6CM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340626446&amp;sr=8-2) or ebay or something. But the phone will be more expensive if you do this, overall however it will probably work out cheaper, but if you want a fancy phone like the galaxy 3, you will have the associated initial cost for it. This is why most people get contracts.

Here is some really rough armchair maths.

UK central government spending in 2011 was 512 billion*, divide that by 60m population and each person costs about £8,500 a year. Even then I am not counting non-taxpayers (children) and the elderly, and local expenditure (social services etc)

In short, tax seems high when it comes off your pay packet, but unless you are a higher rate earner you are going to draw more than you pay in.

 - Those things people complain about    
 - Those things that nobody uses    

While Virgin Media could definitely improve; they also get a lot of slack because everyone uses them and thus has [valid] complaints.     

What you see in threads like this isn't ""proof"" that Virgin Media are terrible, it is a self-selection bias where everyone who ever had a problem with VM complains about them.    

You could do an identical thread with any popular service:    

 - British Airways   
 - Sky   
 - BT   
 - Orange    
 - British Gas    
 - et al    

The only thing I will say in defence of the complaints; is that some people feel especially annoyed by VM because there isn't enough choice locally. You can pick either VM or Dial-Up (which is no choice at all). The same is true in exclusive BT areas.     

Thus why I think the government should use ~~Eminent Domain~~ Compulsory Purchase to buy up all of the underlying internet pipework, nationalise them into one company (e.g. British Rail) and then sell access impartially back to competing ISPs who offer competing access services.

 - Telephone Network    
 - Water Pipes    
 - Gas Pipes

To some extent it depends. If a child is created merely to get more benefits and then is subsequently neglected I dont see how it is more unethical to take the child away. 

Anecdote is not data but I have met a couple of people in my life who had done just that. One of those kids is now an adult and spends most of his time in prison. Do the parents give a flying fuck? Nope.

I admit, that I dont have another option. I can probably identify key issues, and eplain why we have such problems with benefits being a choice not a safety net, but fixing it is different.

Essentially though, i feel we're targeting the wrong thing, I believe that we're essentially blackmailing people into work. Where we should be teaching an entire generation of children differently about how money works, and where it should come from. One of the major problems with our benefits system is that kids growing up have come to see it as that fail safe go to that will look after you. Thats not to say we should stop it being so efficent though, its sayign thyat we should help teenagers actually get into work that allows them to live.

When Tom gets out of college with his A levels, and looks around for jobs, he finds it difficult to get anything he's interested in. He knows he needs a job thugh so he keeps looking, eventually he finds a job at some store, or serving food, the job pays very low wages, and doesnt give him nearly as many hours as he'd need to rent a house, let alone put down a mortgage eventually.  He maybe makes £120 a week, and he's still living with his parents. He's bored as fuck, and so he spends money on drink/ weed/ stupid shit thats not gonna help him get anywhere, finally he decides that actually he's gonna have exactly the same life on benefits, and he'll actually potentially have his own house.

There's our problem, Atm, having a job isnt actually that much better than relying on the state fr your money. And thats if youve actually got a job, which a lot of people dont.

Right, and that's the main problem. How do you punish something where the main victim will be an innocent (all effective punishment for the parents such as benefit withdrawal will hurt the child more)?

I honestly do not have an answer for that. Vouchers? possibly. I don't mind it being demeaning, because that would increase the punishment that is trying to be meted out.

As I say, I don't mind paying money. That's what the social safety net is for. I would like to see fewer people using it as a way of life, not necessarily saving money.",0,1340628764,null,0,false,0,c559r6n,t3_vkd0v,t1_c559r6n,t1_c5594w5,null,1429224580,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I called them telling them that I need an engineer because there is an issue with the line and I keep disconnecting. The issue isn't to do with connecting to the router because I never lose connection to that, it's outside of the house that is the problem. I should note that we have a fuck off green pipe that runs through our garden that wasn't planted properly.

Every single time I called them, they gave me the same stupid fucking script and general diagnostic about how to fix it, despite me telling them that this isn't the issue. The most frustrating thing is that I couldn't even understand what they were saying on the other line, and they sounded like they couldn't understand me.

I called every few months each time they had a different reason for why it was messed up.

I do get the impression that he needs more precise instructions from the manager than he was maybe getting in recent seasons - when to attack, when to defend; when to hit the early cross to Carroll (always, IMO!) and when to make for the byline.

I think he'll get that from Rodgers and will be seen to be one of our most important players this season.

As for the Euros, who are the players who come out with their reputation enhanced? Gerrard, Johnson, Hart, would that be it? Young has probably played his way out of the side and everyone else was pretty much ""as expected"".

When they finally fixed the problem, they somehow managed to combine our service with that of the girls downstairs and began to charge us for both. We realised this pretty quickly as one of the girls was making lots of international calls and our bills shot up from £35 a month to a couple of hundred.

Virign's customer service repeatedly denied that there was any kind of problem, were aggressive and rude when we tried to get it sorted out and when we decided it was finally time to make a complaint, they suddenly couldn't find any details of previous correspondence with them on their systems (after a month of hour long phone calls being made almost every day.)

You do realise that a fair chunk of the welfare expenditure goes on subsidising the wages in the form of tax credits of employers that do not pay a living wage? If you're looking to make savings, welfare will bring pretty marginal returns in comparison to the amount of work and reform involved. 

This is not something you should be doing in a recession when there are far bigger, quicker wins to be had. There are not the jobs for those you want to shift out of benefits, there are not even jobs for those desperate to find ANY job in some areas.

The government has failed to build housing and allowed housing costs to rise substantially, subsequently housing benefit is high as a result. 

Welfare spending is at some of the lowest levels in recent history, and given that we're in a recession where welfare costs rise, the percentage of GDP spent on welfare is just under 7%.

The amount of tax Vodafone was let off by HMRC would have covered JSA for over a year.

This is just a morsel thrown to core voters and distract you from his failings in other areas of government, it's always wheeled out to divide the masses when things like his chums avoiding tax or the fact today the government have put the feelers out in going ahead with the fuel duty rise in a few months.

Dance, puppets.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; The problem arises when kids leave school at 16 and don't have the option of education because they've performed poorly in the system, that's when they get left on the scrapheap. Jobs that require little mental skill or experience (e.g. retail) are often low paid and I guess it makes more sense based on the current benefits system to just claim benefits instead -what's the point in working for Tesco when you could be at home? 

I think this is at the root of our welfare problems, and is something a lot of people who support the welfare system don't really want to touch. The education system in our country fails to stop people flunking out of school with zero education (despite having clearly identifiable problems at an early stage, they were advanced each year as though nothing was wrong), and as a result we essentially end up with people who are useless. This is compounded by the fact that in a 21st century economy the level of education one needs has shot up, even for fairly basic jobs such as retail work. So, we're left with a fairly sizable group of people who are going to need a huge amount of re-education before they will be able to contribute to society in a meaningful way, and no clear strategy for dealing with them, other than to give them just enough welfare to prevent them dying. And then they start having their own kids, and for many of them the cycle will just keep on repeating. 

Now I'm pretty sure that someone reading this will shortly drop by to accuse me of being classist, or of hating poor people. But it's nothing of the sort. My view is that the education system doesn't really work that well for the bottom 20% (and the top 20%), and that our welfare/social care system isn't aggressive enough when it comes to intervening in parenting issues at an age where the child is still young enough for it to not be too late. As a result we're forced to spend large amounts of money (but still nowhere near enough) on a half-arsed approach to dealing with these problems much later in life. And if we don't change how we do things then the problems will just continue to grow.",0,1340634685,null,0,false,0,c55aqso,t3_vkd0v,t1_c55aqso,t1_c5596zz,null,1429225075,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Netflix is, in my opinion, better even though their selection of films isn't as good.

Are they going to raise the legal age of parental responsibility then?

In my experience only assessing someone's value by their own independent tax contributions is only half the story too because in the Software industry at least, it's easy to be on a team who contributes hundreds of thousands of £s in international sales that the tax man never would have gotten his mitts on if it wasn't for me.

The example of your GF is a common story I believe, as people start to earn and are more exposed to the tax system they become more wary of those who benefit too much from it.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;Stopping most under-25s claiming housing benefit.

&gt;Scrapping the non-dependent deduction.

That makes little to no sense. According to Cameron, the average housing benefit award to under 25 year olds is around £90. He then says that by scrapping the non-dependent deduction, families will remain entitled to, on average, £74 per week.

So rather than save £90 per person per week / £4680 per year, the Government would only be saving £832¹


&gt;Cutting benefits for the under-21s.

I left school at 16 and immediately started paying tax and national insurance on my earnings. Quite frankly it pissed me off when I realised that were I to lose my job I wouldn't be entitled to the ""full rate"" of JSA due to my age - I'd imagine people in that situation if / when these proposals are passed would be even more livid - you'd be expected to pay tax and national insurance, but if you lose your job, you can't get any help? What about Contribution based JSA, will that also be scrapped for under 21 year olds?

&gt;Ending subsidised social housing for the wealthy.

This one I can see being well received, across most different demographics. It'll depend, of course, on what exactly the Government defines as ""wealthy households"" - one wonders if the figure a household needs to bring home to be classed as such will change between different parts of the U.K.

&gt;Uprating benefits in line with wage inflation instead of price inflation when price inflation is much higher.

Should appeal to the Daily Mail crowd who think JSA is already too high. For reference this years uprating increased the amount of JSA over 25s are entitled to, by a grant total of £3.50 per week.

&gt;Cutting benefits for the long-term unemployed.

How are we defining ""long-term"" unemployed? Longer than two years? Longer than three? If this particular proposal were to be passed, I could list you at least one hundred people who'll see no choice but to revert back to a life of crime [Which I'm **not** advocating, by any stretch of the imagination.]

&gt;Cutting housing benefit further.

For most single people, housing benefit is already paid at a rate lower than the market rates. That'll change further when the rates are re-assessed to represent the lower 33% of the market, in January 2013. Combined with the increase of the single room rent rate to under 35s [It previously only applied to under 25s], this **will** lead to significant numbers of people being forced out of their current accommodation, and facing real difficulties trying to find a new place to live.

&gt;Stopping people from claiming child-related benefits if they have more than a certain number of children.

Honestly, I'm not sure what I think about this. I can see the potential advantages to it, albeit under a plethora of significant disadvantages.

&gt;Requiring people on out-of-work benefits to gain basic literacy and numeracy skills.

Absolutely fine. One could argue this is indicative of the state of the education system in this country, but that aside, I think it's perfectly fine to expect people receiving welfare to have a minimum standard in both English and Maths. I **don't** however, think those should be requirements to actually start receiving welfare; they should be a condition of continued entitlement.

&gt;Requiring people on out-of-work benefits to prepare a CV.

Again, perfectly reasonable. I don't, however, think you should be restricted from starting your claim if you don't have a CV. Allow people to start their claim, and give them the choice of supplying their own CV within say a fortnight, or failing that, invite 'em in and have one produced for them [Really, you could knock up a quick Macro in Word that allows DWP staff to type in the pertinent details and have it spit out a rough CV that could work as an interim measure.]

&gt; Requiring able people on out-of-work benefits to do full-time community work after a certain period.

This'll likely end up like the God awful work programme we currently have, which is marginally better than Flexible New Deal, New Deal and the awful programmes that preceded them. **IF** the Government want people to work for their benefits, how about rather than doing menial work, we actually have them doing work that's advantageous, both to the community and to the claimant. In other words, a ""work placement"" where, even if they don't get a permanent position at the end of it, as an *absolute minimum* they'll gain skills and abilities that will benefit them with their progression into work / back into work?

&gt;Requiring people on sickness benefits to improve their health.

I thin the Government needs to tread very, very carefully with this one. There's a fine line between helping people improve their health, and suddenly deeming very, very ill people ""fit to work"".

&gt;Requiring more single parents to work - or at least to prepare for work.

One can only assume the Government will be footing the bill for the required care of these kids? That aside, I think it's perfectly fine to ask single parents, once their kids are all at school, to begin to look for work. I don't, however, agree that they should be forced back into work when their kids start Secondary School.

&gt;Imposing tougher restrictions on people claiming benefits if they have never worked than if they have paid tax and national insurance for years before submitting a claim.

Problem with this, are the kids who're booted out of their homes. I was kicked out at seventeen; Fortunately I was in a full time job, and so after sleeping under my desk for a few days, was eventually able to sleep on a couch, before getting a flat. I was lucky, in that I had a stable job, and access to funds. That's not going to be the case for everyone - it's **significantly** more difficult for young people to find a job these days - by potentially removing their ability to claim welfare, you run the risk of exposing them to potentially dangerous situations.

&gt;Stopping teenagers from claiming benefits as soon as they leave school.

If the Government want to go down this road, then surely there needs to be *something* at the end for school leavers? Perhaps a guaranteed bit of work experience somewhere?

&gt;Stopping paying winter fuel payments and other non-contributory benefits to people who live abroad.

Middle England should love that one :)

&gt;Stopping paying some benefits in cash and paying them instead in benefits in kind, like free school meals.

The Government [and preceding ones] have a piss poor record when it comes to spending money wisely. If a person is entitled to welfare, let 'em spend it how they want. I mean, when they get into work, they won't have the Government dictating how they should spent their wages; why should they be dictated whilst claiming welfare?

¹Naturally it's not quite that simple, as that assumes every current claiment comes from one child families, which obviously isn't the case.

Completely agree. Even now, it boggles my mind when I see people, six, nine, even a year unemployed who don't even have a basic CV. I don't, however, believe that the lack of a CV should be a barrier to starting a claim for JSA - simply make it a condition that a CV will either be provided within two weeks, or if the person isn't able to produce a CV, have the DWP staff generate one [quick 15 minute interview coupled with a Macro in Word should produce a basic CV], then book 'em onto a   course that details how to write &amp; tailor CVs, Spec.

I can't blame anyone in that position for not taking work given the circumstances. This is why I think that the coalition policy of a universal credit. combined with a flexible taper of welfare as you earn more is a good idea, and I also think the plan to have one monthly payment direct to the recipient rather than multiple payments some of which are made directly to the landlord is a good idea.  However I know it is going to cause a huge amount of problems as many social housing providers simply aren't setup to deal with lots of individual payments, and many of their customers will never have had to budget with a monthly income before. 

And despite the outrage, I do think that housing benefit should only be paid to under 25's if they cannot live with their parents (there does need to be some flexibility there).

One is a way of engaging with a human being in a mature and sensible manner, the other is to pretend that the MP is just a counting machine who judges issues by how many emails arrive.

Currently using their service, and ever since they took over from Tiscali several years ago, there hasn't been a full month go by where the internet hasn't been intermittent, capped, or just not working.

The problems started when the internet light on the router started flashing If you loaded a page when the light was on, no problem. If you loaded a page when it was off, then your browser of choice would take 20 seconds to give you a ""this page cannot be displayed"" screen. Imagine how online gaming was affected.

We must have phoned up their customer service line twenty times, and every time it was the same: ""Have you tried turning it off and on again? Have you tried a new ADSL splitter? Is your phones working? Have you tried a different router?"" [seriously, as though most people have a spare, working £30 router lying around]. Once you've done all that shit, they let you know that an engineer will call you back, and you pick a time when you're free to be called back. To no-one's surprise, **no engineer will ever call back**. No matter how enthusiastically they promise you that the engineer callout won't cost you anything, they will 100% charge you £50 fir it, if not more (even if the engineer does nothing, which was our experience)

We then eventually got a new phone line installed through BT, and the problem went away. **They then capped our internet speed at 256kbps**. I had to phone up again (three times in total) to fix that... And now the original problem has come back.

I would never choose autocratic. Democracy for the law making chamber, independently appointed senate for the revising chamber.

&gt; I'm saying there's little point in trying to avoid it by believing that a set of experts will reach a consensus so easily 

The scientific community has achieved consensus on many issues by application of the scientific method, which is a form of critical thinking. It isn't easy, but it is frequently achieved.

&gt; ""..why we need a council of the wise..""
&gt; That sounds a little bit subjective.

Someone who has reached the top of their profession and has a proven ability to apply critical thinking. Not easy to test, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

&gt; Someone may say about ten years ago Andrew Wakefield was wise. Today we may say he's a corrupt tosser. But in the press at least he was considered an expert. A wise man seeing an esoteric connection between autism and MMR. Debateable whether in the field that was the case mind.

He wasn't corrupt -- he was mistaken. And he *was* an expert. He made the fundamental mistake of asserting cause and effect based upon little more than temporal coincidence. He was probably driven by the need to get published -- science funding is erroneously based upon number of papers published, when it should be based upon quality and value.

&gt; It's a medical example I know, but it still points out that any expert is subject to personal and professional failings.

It's a good but *rare* example of where the peer review process failed, initially at least.

&gt; Naturally this falls on the professional politicians too.

But they are much more prone to error because they base their decisions upon deeply held beliefs, rather than the application of critical thinking.

&gt; Furthermore you might read it as an example of the public being stupid in believing the press, which again is a failing of democracy, that if the people aren't informed then they are liable to faults themselves in certain choices.

Indeed. So we need a council of the wise to help to save us from our poor choices. Especially as the choice is rarely more than Hobson's.

&gt; Now that's a stereotype, really there were far more public school educated MPs twenty maybe thirty years ago than there are today.

You are right -- I over-egged that one.

&gt; If they're scrutinising bills they should know what's up. And this is why I think I brought up the word ""meritocratic"" earlier in this long running debate.

But you cannot ensure any kind of merit via popular election.

&gt; ""I am only advocating a Senate at national level.""
&gt; An unelected senate. That's ultimately my problem with it. Sorry fella.

A senate, by definition, is a house of elders. And elders are chosen for their implicit wisdom. You cannot elect someone to old age or to wisdom. So *elected senate* is a contradiction.

&gt; But anyway, whilst I'd admire your effort to complete a counterbalance, I see as much faults in it as I do the democratic system. No offense but it's a bit idealistic.

None taken, you're right :)

I have enjoyed our debate; you have made some very good points and have consequently made me think. I value that. Cheers.

Can someone else please buy this venue? There planning on turning the upstairs into a Function room for weddings / parties.

The Venue was in a state when we got there and there was human feces in the backstage fridge (health and safety?). Because of this, the promoter did not see why he should pay the venue as they had made him loose £200. The manage went mad and refused to let bands take there gear out (these are bands from all across the UK and a Rise Records band form the USA). Due to this i have heard that all the sound men have quit along with a bunch of bar staff. This is an outrage and ever since this new management the hydrant has going to shit. Even the security agreed with me and they had been there 7 years. As someone who is in a band and puts on shows (many of them being at the hydrant) for around 2 years, i am sad to see one of the only good venues in brighton go.

I think there is a distinction between being a tax payer and a voter that is blurred by some people and certain newspapers. Tax is the money that you pay society for allowing you to be a part of it. It is as a citizen that you get a vote on policies. Blurring this distinction leads to claims like ""spending taxpayers' money"" in news reports, it is misleading. Taxpayers have paid money to society in order to be part of it, it is now societies' money to be spent on how the voters want. Therefore I don't think the justification of tax avoidance if an individual disagrees with current policy follows (although I take the point that it is prone to hyperbolization, focusing exclusively on schools and hospitals and such).

Gerrard has shown he can play the role of the distributor, press effectively and make [tackles](http://www.whoscored.com/Blog/_h-i15jsj0uu30anyqd9sw/Show/Euro-2012-Focus-Player-Stats-Leaderboards). He has repeatedly said recently that he feels as if he is in great shape, while he may not be able to roar from box to box he can be effective in a deeper role. For example, Lampard (when he finally accepted it) performed admirably for Chelsea next to Mikel allowing Mata to roam free further up the pitch.

Gerrard is immensely talented, he can break from his position and get into goal scoring positions or, as he has shown this summer so pertinently, crossing positions. Few midfielders have his quality in those areas. I'm certain there is a role for Gerrard in this system. However, for once he won't have to carry the team. Something he may need to adjust to, especially if the likes of Henderson are to flourish.

As for the discrimination angle? The ability to donate blood should be restricted. By donating blood you're putting the health and well-being of total strangers in your hands; As a regular blood donor [Bronze award] I know it's likely my blood has been used to keep people alive.

Which is why I personally don't think people should be able to walk in off the streets and donate blood. It's a serious, serious decision to make, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly.

Personally I just don't agree that being in a committed, monogamous relationship can preclude you from donating. If you're exposed to a higher degree of risk, then absolutely you shouldn't be allowed to donate [see my previous comments re: drug abusers.].

Of course what's really annoying about it, is that if the number of straight people who're perfectly capable of donating actually did so, then there'd be no need for ""tainted puffter blood""¹, as there'd be enough blood in the system to go around.

He played out of his mind that season, and I don't think that skill just disappears in a player so young.

With his rough season or two and the big drop in asking price, it has all the makings of a great deal for the club if he pans out.

As for Schurrle, I guess I always thought of him more as a Hulk/Sturridge than a true winger.

Even though it sticks in the throat a bit, I thing we have to tolerate a modicum of welfare dependency and even out and out fraud, so that we carry on supporting the genuine claimants. It's analogous tot he way the banks tolerate a small amount of credit card fraud.  

The government should try to tackle this a bit more energetically during the next boom time, if there ever is one. Then at least the jobs will be there for them to encourage welfare dependents into.

But the point stands, there is no reason why people should be subsidized by the taxpayer outside of specific situations (serious illness/disability, or temporary support between jobs if you have paid into the system for a couple of years)

It is not the state's responsibility to guarantee ""equality of outcome"" or to ensure everyone has a great quality of life, or even a minimum quality of life beyond healthcare.

If people are vulnerable or have a serious educational problem, then they should be fully supported.

If they didn't work hard in school and can't find a job now, then that is the moral hazard.

If they had a kid too early, then that is the moral hazard.

It used to be a serious taboo to have a child as a single mother partly because of the economic implications. We need to get back to that in my opinion.

Bittorrent is a very noisy protocol, and generates a LOT of packets, so it's worth controlling on larger scale networks. Peer-to-peer is the only thing we do actively nobble though, they have free reign over everything else.

Just so you know the rates for ESA and JSA under 25 is £56.25 a week (paid fortnightly) it's goes up to £72 a week over 25. 

So the rates are the same at least for the first 12 weeks after which people on ESA have to complete a medical questionnaire and in most cases have to attend a work capability assessment in their local area with an external company called ATOS which to be fair are shit and don't assess people correctly, any way if you score 15 points on the WCA you stay on the benefit and are either placed in the work related activity group which is for people who with the right help support and training will hopefully be able to work again and get £26.?? (I think) extra and if your placed in the support group which is for people who are never likely to work again you get an extra £32.?? Added on a week. There are premiums you can get added on if you satisfy certain conditions. I have seen customers who have been transferred over from incapacity benefit and are getting close to £300 a week get disability living allowance on top which can of course either be a two amounts added together or half that and a free car, housing benefit which can pay I believe 90% of your rent and council tax which can pay 100% of that.

&gt; I'm a bit worried that everyone is looking to blame some imagined authority or government that can exercise power over everything as a way of removing responsibility from the individual.

I do think the individual does come into it, especially parents. A significant number seem to abdicate their parental responsibility and expect the state to do everything for them. Which is a self-enforcing cycle, especially when their kids grow up and have their own kids, and having never learned the value of personal discipline will fail to pass it on to their kids.

true,NeauxWai,tardis,TARDIS,"From all the sources I've searched, Eccleston stayed one season for a combination of the following reasons:

1. He only ever intended to stay for one year since the beginning.
2. He wanted to leave because he did not like the way the show was headed.
3. He wanted to leave because of ""political"" issues, but he does not regret it, and he thinks he did what was best.
4. The aim of the first season was a full crash-course introduction to the Doctor, so it needed a regeneration.

For whatever of these reasons or combinations thereof, it was one year. I am so glad that we had Christopher Eccleston. He was *fantastic.* I am also so glad that David Tennant arrived when he did.

I am always torn when it comes to speculation. I love Doctor Who, and I understand that Doctor Who would not be the same if anything were altered. If Eccleston stayed on longer, would Tennant have ever played the role? Would the storyline have happened at all like it did? I don't think it would have.

But I would have loved more time with Eccleston. He did amazingly with what he was given and I was excited to see the development of his character.

**Finally**, I do *not* hold anything against him for leaving when he did and not wanting to revisit the role. It makes me sad when people call him a ""jerk"" for not wanting to come back to something 7 years old in his career. Who are they to judge?? It's not fair to him as a professional for fans to hold grudges over that and bad-mouth him for not doing what they want.

I was deliberately given poor advice when I started at university and was sold the wrong type of current account.

It sounds totally stupid but they did have a current account back then with such restrictions.

I opened another (perfectly suitable) account with another bank and went to close the AN account, with the branch staff (different branch, different town) treating me like I was Ian Huntley and generally being rude, sarky and dismissive.  How dare I close my account or request access to my money?  Another occasion my brother was in his branch (because he used them at the time too) and someone walks in, slams his chequebook and cards on the counter and demands his money right now because ""you've messed me about far too often"".  Turns out they'd pratted about and delayed a time critical house sale.

I had a massive problem with Virgin Mobile. After being with them for 10 years, I wanted to upgrade my phone when my contract needed renewing. I chose a phone and was told I had 14 days to bring it back if I didn't like it and just be put on a rolling SIM contract. I ended up taking it back because the battery was awful.

It wasn't until 2 months later that I realised that I was still being charged for the phone contract. I rang them and told them, they then said that I hadn't taken it back to the shop and I still had it. So I had to go into the shop and sort that all out. 

I continued to have problems with them when I was put onto the rolling SIM contract, with them randomly charging me for calls to other Virgin mobiles, which are unlimited. I rang up and asked why I was charged and they said that I had used up all 3000 of my unlimited Virgin minutes, this clearly wasn't the case because I could count them up on my ebill and it came to about 400. The woman on the phone to Customer Service told me that it wasn't a fault on their part, and only this one time would they refund me for the extra they had charged me. Needless to say I was put on hold several times when the girl couldn't grasp the concept that there was no way I could have used 3000 minutes and I could only count 400 on my bill. 

I ended up leaving them not long after a few more problems and calls. Moved to Giffgaff and haven't had any problems with them at all. 

TL;DR just more confirmation that Virgin is utter wank.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I think it's worth watching. And, honestly, as much as people hate on it these days, it was actually fairly well received. What stopped the series from continuing was that Fox cancelled the project when they weren't happy with the initial audience, but that's Fox for you. It got 8 million viewers instead of 9 million, or something like that.

The biggest shame is that the TARDIS never got used again. Seriously, it's my favorite TARDIS by far. Even compared to 11's TARDIS, it's also still probably the most expensive TARDIS.

Anyway, if you do watch it, keep a few things in mind:

For starters, this was meant as a pilot episode. So there are many things about it that show really bad. There are things that get brought up and never addressed, as to be addressed later in the eventual season of episodes, or the fact that it takes quite a bit for 8th Doctor to actually show up. The way I like to tell people is imagine getting to *only* watch Rose, the pilot episode for the new series, and getting to watch nothing else. It would be very easy to say the same kind of things people do about the movie, but about Eccleston/Rose.

Next thing is the intro. The intro is a bit half assed, and gets the actual intro wrong. In the movie it's explained that The Master is put on trial for war crimes, and that the Daleks gave the remains to The Doctor to return to Gallifrey. The books put it much better, and go much more into detail. Essentially in an attempt to continue living(Prior to this, The Master had ran out of regenerations and died), he found a way to continue living, and joined forces with The Daleks.  The Daleks find out that he was double crossing them, and have him exterminated.  Upon his death, the Master creates a psychic link with The Doctor asking for a dying wish, to have his remains returned to Gallifrey. The Doctor, remembering how him and The Master used to be friends in their youths, decides to oblige considering it is his dying wish. The books also go into exactly how The Master was able to survive beyond his 13th regeneration, which ties into his ethereal form in the movie, but I don't quite recall it right now.

Finally, there's a whole issue of The Doctor being 'half human'. It's discovered by The Master in the movie that The Doctor is, in fact, half human. The Doctor confirms this by jokingly saying that he's half human 'on his mother's side'. This has sparked huge controversy over the legitimacy of this statements, and is the center of a lot of the hate that the movie gets. Some people like, and even embrace, the idea, while others despise it and treat it like it never happened. Whatever side of the fence you happen to fall on, it is mentioned in a later comic by The Doctor that he was using the chameleon arch to make himself half human. Since the comic falls under the 'semi-canon' umbrella, you can take from that as you will.",0,1340657775,null,0,false,0,c55gp2w,t3_vl2u1,t1_c55gp2w,t1_c55frx9,null,1429227932,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

This makes them software pirates. When confronted with this they told me it would be illegal to give me the source code as they would be responsible for any modifications made to the firmware (there is no legal precedent for that and it is total BULLSHIT). Unfortunately while there is a legal precedent for getting sued for GPL violations, it is mostly the SFLC who are US based and have been given the right to sue on behalf of various GPL authors 

Here is the email from the point where I gave up talking to them as they are either abusing their power because they know nobody will sue them or just don't have a fucking clue how to read. 

Dear Juan,

Thank you for your email.

The specific model of Netgear router that we supply is copyrighted to
Orange, and we are not obliged to provide the source codes for the
firmware.

Any further requests for this information will be met with the same
response.

If you have any further queries then please do not hesitate to get in
contact with us again.

Kind Regards

------------------------------

&gt; The firmware for our Netgear router has been specifically configured for 

&gt; Orange. This is also Copyrighted to Orange and we have no legal

&gt; obligation to provide the Source Codes for this.

This is not possible, unless you are claiming that you have written your own OS or ported something other than Linux and it's associated router utilities, yet somehow managed to score a 99% match with a linux 2.6.20+ kernel in terms of network responses.

&gt; If we were to provide the Source Codes for our firmware to our

&gt; customer's this gives them the ability to access the firmware for all

&gt; Orange router's and can be used for illegal purposes.

You are obliged to give the Source Code to the parts of the firmware
that are under the GPL or derivative works of those products (e.g the current
precident is that you don't need yo give up your binaries firmware for the modem
as long as it's a module and not linked against the kernel)

&gt; The source codes for Netgear's own firmware are legally obtainable and

&gt; you can request these from Netgear themselves.

If we were to provide the Source Codes for our firmware to our customer's this gives them the ability to access the firmware for all Orange router's and can be used for illegal purposes.

You are not responsible for what is done with a router you provide any
more than Dell or Apple are responsible for what is done with their hardware,
there is no legal precedent suggesting you would be. However gpl compliance
has a long standing precedent

http://gpl-violations.org/news.html

http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2007/nov/20/busybox/

http://www.fsf.org/news/2009-05-cisco-settlement.html

While orange has not been forced to comply yet, previously your French parent company did realise they were wrong and voluntarily complied over livebox, as have the Israeli division
http://www.pcworld.fr/2009/11/30/internet/des-livebox-open-orange/461461/&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgb9mRQaPJpWO-_6LiiRuSRvHPDg

http://www.orange.co.il/selfservice/technical-support/isp/open-source-
resource-center1/

And while Netgear's posting of the source code they ship in the same hardware is nice (And shows that your product is very likely to contain GPL code and you have to comply) it does not count as compliance from you, nor does it include ""scripts used to control compilation"" or ""script used to control installation""

&gt; I hope this has now clarified this matter for you, but if you've any

&gt; further queries then please don't hesitate to get in contact with us

&gt; again.

&gt;

Unfortunately it has not clarified the matter:

If you are claiming the router contains NO GPL'd code, then I would like
you to state so explicitly.

If you are claiming you don't have to comply with the GPL I'm still not
sure why you think that is the case?

If you think you are complying with the GPL then I would like to be
pointed to the code that is used in the firmware revision V2.1.00.39_RG

Thanks,

Juan

Think about this, 77% of the families on housing benefits are families with an earner, that is, someone who has a job. These efforts to curtail people from applying for housing benefits are hitting hard working people.

You want to get people off those benefits, up the minimum wage, dont just start cutting the benefits they actually might need.

Private healthcare and education are not isolated systems - nothing in our society is. They're staffed by people, some (probably most, in fact) will have benefited extensively and directly from government education and healthcare, various regulatory authorities, the roads to get to work. Any healthcare you received almost certainly resulted in part from public-funded medical research. If your parents owned a business, they did not need to worry that their businesses would be robbed and their staff attacked.

Indeed, far from your assertion that your existence has cost far less than most people's and you and your parents should pay less, if you earn a lot or run a business (assuming your parents did) then you've actually benefited a lot more intangibly since you're likely to need skilled employees (who you can get because they've been educated and cared for via taxation), you need people to be able to buy your goods, you need protection to ensure that your wealth remains yours (both from domestic and international threats).

You pay tax because you live in a society with other human beings, and that comes with rights *and* responsibilities, like jury duty. 

As for the ""You'd do it too!"" argument, absolutely facile. We don't let children get away with that: ""All the other kids do it!"". We are grown adults here, aren't we?

And I agree whole heartedly with each of your points.  Since going there, the only things I have found out is change in procedures and a couple of jobs that fit my criteria, which I find out myself of the website.

I have applied to numerous jobs, and had multiple interviews with no luck, so I do not know which of the two is lacking, beyond asking for feedback from potential employers, which is the last thing on my mind when rejected from a job.  I have also given them 3 CVs and all they said was: 'Thank you.' and mark it down, with no possible changes given to me.  I don't know if that is good or not.

To be honest, they are doing what they are told to do, and clearly the rest is up to us who use it as a way to prove we are doing what we will say, but I have found them helpful in one category, and that is making sure I don't starve, beyond that I am doing the rest of the work.

They do set up career fare type things, every once in a while, which is a few business dictating information to you and how to get a job, which is all fine and dandy, however it isn't show up on one of the set days, it was show up on this day, and luckily (afterwards, unluckily) I had an interview which meant I missed it, so they tried to have another for those who did, which was written by the staff from the Job Centre themselves, and as informative as it was, it was perhaps useful to those who had never worked and new to the job market, not to those who have worked for a few years and now on the hunt again.",0,1340661604,null,0,false,0,c55ho8f,t3_vknoj,t1_c55ho8f,t1_c55hf2n,null,1429228389,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Yes, I don't blame the guys on the computers, but whoever is making the decisions is extraordinarily incompetent (whether it be individual managers, or people on the national level). You have a ten or fifteen minute appointment every week, or every other week, and most of it is spent watching someone clicking through menus on a computer. It should be one click to confirm that everything is in order, and the rest of the time spent giving advice. You could use the time for a short mock interview, by shuffling who you see, and a bit of thought as to how it was set up. 

And the advisers should be split up so that they each deal with one sector of employment, say, construction, teaching, administration, nursing, and so on, so that they actually know something about each area. You might even reward advisers in a modest way for getting people into positions, or getting them interviews. There's so much that could be done to make it a functional job service, and on the same budget as at present. It is very frustrating.

The big companies (well BT mainly) provide the infrastructure but have to sell capacity wholesale so there isnt US style local monopolies and it is one area where there are (at least in service and customer issues) massive problems due to scale.

The resellers are much smaller and so don't have the institutional fuck upery of the large companies (with outsourced call centres, generally not caring about customer service, over selling problems and so on) who dont ultimately need to sort that out because they make their sales through advertising and hard selling and often low pricing. 

The small companies make their sales through being good, getting recommendations and good reviews and bad service would hurt their bottom line in a way it doesnt with say Virgin who will sign you up in the street.

Was then told it would take 24 hours to move it to my name. Fine. Called 48 hours later to sort out the issue of keeping my number, told I wasn't the account holder. When I questioned that, they gave the excuse that the system had gone down and therefore it could take 28 days. Fuck sake.

30+ days later, Virgin fucked up my contract by sending me an entirely new sim, with a new number, despite the fact it had been confirmed that I would keep my number and my sim, the contract would simply refresh onto it.

I think this is rather confused logic. Say you have two parents with one early twenties daughter, all eligible for HB. The parents live in a two bed house at a cost of £175 a week. Under the current system, the two options are that their daughter lives with them, and they get £100 a week, or that the daughter lives elsewhere, and the parents get the full £175, and the child perhaps another £100 for a flat. In other words, the parents and child are massively incentivized to use the system that costs the taxpayer almost twice as much. In other words, the £74 saving doesn't exist, because people wouldn't live with their parents under the current system.

true,hhmmmm,null,null,"&gt;At least right now, Virgin Media, O2 and BT are competing for lower prices, better connection reliability and faster speeds.

They do compete well on price (look at the US where they dont, the internet costs are insane), but they could compete well on price and there be some sort of infrastructure control by someone other than BT. 

They are not investing in any serious degree in infrastructure upgrades though. That is the big issue.

BT recently announced that copper wire from the exchange to home is basically all they will do for existing housing, that the speeds they can provide will be sufficient so the majority of homes will not get direct fibre optic lines from the exchange and we will be behind everyone again permanently. Hopefully the government will decide to invest in them at some point.

I think we could do with a not shit rail track for line infrastructure.

BT kind of have that role and have been forced to sell capacity wholsesale to people so there could be a market (the cable companies, Virgin now I guess it is being the only line competitor), yet BT have repeatedly shown they really arent all that interested in delivering the kind of internet infrastructure improvements the country really needs.

tottenham claimed 4th place in engand. there, the ""shotlander"" (play on words which sounds similar to icelander in german), as bild has nicknamed the icelander due to his great goals, will be able to shoot on at a higher level. in 10/11, with 9 hits, he was hoffenheims best, at swansea he shone with 7 goals and 5 assists, and was named epl player of the month in march.

everything looked like a switch to swansea was in order. with them, hoffenheim agreed to a transfer fee of roughly 9 million. everyone was on board, except sigurdsson. when his manager brenden rogers switched to liverpool, the reds suddenly became the hot candidate. until tottenham approached..

Business does a lot of good, and I recognise that. It's typical of your libertarian drivel that if I don't support what you think I must be a totalitarian. Unfortunately for you, like pretty much everyone who isn't a total nutball (i.e., not you) is for a *mixed economy*. The debate is about what exactly that entails.

Genuine question: are you a novelty account whose entire schtick is a combination of absurdism and strawmen? Because I never claimed that trade couldn't exist without a government (though I don't think society can exist without a set of common values, understandings, and laws, whether that be in government form or otherwise). Could you point me to where I did?

Additionally, do you have any evidence that private schools are better per se because they are private rather than due to economic and social selectivity or resources available?

true,JayJayWonton,tardis,TARDIS,"     I loved Doctor Who for about 2 years now, and my entire family watches the show. It's pretty spectacular that even though my family and friends have different interests, likes, and dislikes, we can all sit around the television together and watch it. This show has something that everyone can enjoy, I suppose. 
     It also gives me this feeling, I'm not sure what to call it, that I used to get when I was a young child. Like when your parents read you the story of Peter Pan, and you'd wait by your window all night for a boy to fly up and take you off on an adventure. It gives me this sort of giddy-ness that I'll get an adventure like the one the Doctor is having on the screen. I know it isn't real, but just the idea of travelling through all of time and space just tickles my imagination with thoughts of fighting different species and seeing beautiful landscapes of other worlds.
      To be honest, I have no idea how many episodes you have to become a Whovian. When I first started watching it, I couldn't stand it. It seemed utterly ridiculous and idiotic, and I had no idea why my friends enjoyed it so much. Still, my friends persisted I watch more of it. I began watching them on T.V. whenever they were on, so I never did watch them in order. I don't remember how much I watched of it, but I eventually hated it less and less, and it escalated to the point where I was a fan of it.
     I've ran into people who have watched a good portion of the show and haven't ended up liking it, so I could understand if you find it to be a little unentertaining. This show isn't for everyone, although it is rather close, in my opinion. I highly suggest you watch a few episodes, because this show has certainly changed my life and the way I view things.",0,1340672338,null,0,false,0,c55k6bs,t3_vlp04,t1_c55k6bs,t3_vlp04,null,1429229606,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You'll note among the ideas and thinkers I've listed none of them are socialist thinkers. This is quite deliberate. Over half predate socialist thinking, sometimes by hundreds of years, in a couple of cases a thousand or two. The reason for this is simple: a *lot* of libertarians seem to be constitutionally incapable (forgive the awful pun) of actually talking about issues off the rails of a spectrum in which everything is either libertarian and conforms to the non-aggression principle, or instead to some degree violates it, in which case it is a member of a muddled clan (""fascist leaning"" in your words) of fascists, authoritarians, statists, and other libertarian boogeymen. 

I honestly don't get it. This last response by you has had nothing to do with what I've said - it's simply a repeat of libertarian talking points. Quite literally that - you have Nozick's ""Taxation is theft!"", you have ""Swedish sterilisation!"", ""The ends don't justify the means!"" Let's take just that last one. If we go back up to Cicero and Aristotle, you'll find neither of them say that the ends justify the means. Did you know that, did you even consider that? No, because it seems to you if they're not libertarian they're part of a mish-mash of bad guys who are just complicating the basic truth of libertarianism. Do you appreciate at all the irony of declaring I lack the realisation of ""a moral framework"", and then ignoring everything I say to make the debate along the lines *YOU* feel it should proceed?

true,dessiatin,null,null,"I saw it for the first time the other week and it drove me mad. It's the timing and the flat acting. All the little nuances that go into good performance and direction just aren't present at all. In the original first episode with almost the exact same lines, the way each line is delivered (and perhaps more importantly what the actors are doing when they're not saying anything) gives you an instant insight into who the main characters are. Chris Morris's Renholm is a barking, slightly raving madman who knows nothing about business but knows everything there is to know about[ ***BUSINESS***](http://i.imgur.com/GGunT.jpg). Jen is clearly seen to be inept within seconds. Before answering the phone in the original Roy doesn't just wait for a bit then answer, he labours over the whole process, eating his donut, licking his fingers, looking like he's reaching for the phone but then grabbing his cup. When he does respond he's not making some chipper joke, he fucking *hates* his job and the people he works under. In comparison the Americans are just people saying lines. 


""I say a thing""


""Then I say a funny thing""


laugh track


""Alright let's move onto the next joke""

There's no care in it, no real effort beyond the bare minimum. It's not so much a problem with America as it is with almost any adaptation. It all comes down to the fact that the people making the show just don't care about it. And why should they? It's not *their* show. They didn't write it. They didn't come up with any of the ideas. The original show was written and directed by Graham Linehan alone, about characters he came up with and jokes that spewed from his head and all the hundreds of little references and in-jokes that *mean something to him*. So when he's picking the actors and telling them what to do and overseeing the edit and everything else, there's no question of half-arseing it because it's *his*. He wants it to be something to be proud of, not just another pay-cheque. 

The exact same thing will happen with the inbetweeners, mark my words. As well as being their creation, a huge amount of the jokes in the show come from the teenage years of the writers, Damon Beesley and Iain Morris. The show is as much laughing at them as it is at the actual cast, so in what world would some entirely unrelated American who doesn't get the concept of self-deprecation put the time and effort into it as they did?

You may feel more in sync with one era than the other (like I feel more at home with 5&amp;6 than the others). It's very insane and a lot of fun either way. And it's better if you try not to pit one era against the other.

Starting with series 1 may be the best way to go, though the special effects aren't that great. If you really don't like it you could try out series 5 (""The Eleventh Hour""). I first saw the first episode of series 6 and was hooked.

Great stand-alone starter episodes (lots of different genres here):

1. ""Dalek"" (probably the best episode of the new series so far with the Daleks, Doctor Who's oldest monster/enemy)

2. ""Father's Day"" (more of an emotional one)

3. ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" (horror)

4. ""School Reunion"" (fun, and brings back the wonderful Sarah Jane Smith from the classic series, and her ""dog"" K9)

5. ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" (I think this one is quite fun, but it's also an emotional romance)

6. ""The Impossible Planet""/""The Satan Pit"" (horror)

7. ""Smith and Jones"" (nice introduction of new companion)

8. ""Human Nature""/""The Family of Blood"" (historical romance...it's utterly beautiful)

9. ""Blink"" (horror, very simple, hardly and Doctor. One of the most famous episodes)

10. ""The Doctor's Daughter"" (the beginning is really rushed, but the rest is fantastic)

11. ""Silence in the Library""/""Forest of the Dead"" (just about everything)

12. ""Midnight"" (horror)

13. ""The Eleventh Hour"" (great reboot, kind of crazy)

14. ""The Vampires of Venice"" (lots of fun, and Rory's a great character)

15. ""Vincent and the Doctor"" (great historical story with a message)

History didn't change into a world where Amy's parents never existed when they went into the crack -- otherwise Amy would have disappeared as well.  When things went into the crack, all *awareness* of them disappeared.  Other people simply forgot they'd ever been, and to them it was perfectly normal no matter how illogical it really was.  Amy didn't think her parents had died or anything; she thought she never had any.

true,ben9345,english,London,"Totally agree. I have been looking in the last hour or so for the [full 22 min pilot which is harder than it might seem to find.](http://www.novamov.com/video/jfvvf3xe2w1gp) and the way they portray the boss, Denholm, is not as crazy but a little evil. In the original when they go to him to complain before being told if they couldn't work as a team they would be fired they tag a little bit on the end revealing he never intended to fire them just keep them on their toes and then he gets their new coffee machine taken to his office. Its so disappointing to not have that larger than life character but this may be because Chris Morris is a legend. 

Besides, Joel Mchale is far to good looking to be a dishevelled geek with no luck with ordinary people which make the whole point of the episode (to raise the IT dept.s popularity level with a party) useless. He looks like he would get along fine. The US version is also a few minutes shorter meaning they cut some of the banter and most of the long stare at the beginning. That's what made the characters look like they actually knew each other, their in jokes etc like you say. 

I also want to point out the part where Roy says ""They have no respect for us up there"" which in the US version makes very little sense as it jumps from Roy not 'hitting it off' with a girl on 5th to 'no respect'. But when combined in the original with the preceding line of ""And while I was working on it she  rested a cup on my back"". That's the lack of respect they're talking about. I fear the editor was given free reign to make room for the extra ad space they need for US shows. This also reminded me what a good actor Chris O'Dowd is. His ability to react and his ability to have a range of emotions in his voice is not nearly matched by Mchale. 

I must finally apologise for the evil I have wrought on this world by bringing the full episode to your attention. I'm sorry, sincerely.

Against Benfica he came on as a sub for Juan Mata and slotted himself straight into the #10 position, occasionally rotating with Lamps who was playing the double pivot with Mikel. 

In the new squad he has fallen further down in the pecking order &amp; his chances of playing in that slot have been greatly diminished. He isn't an automatic first-choice in a 4-3-3 either - that would probably be Lamps, Ramires &amp; Mikel, given the current squad. The only problem with letting him go is that we don't have an adequate backup in his stead - Essien &amp; Romeu are defensive mids, Josh is raw &amp; Malouda is, well, Malouda.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"His being a defensive liability happened at times when he was played out of position, IMO. The two examples pointed out in this sub-thread were both matches where he was played out of position.

* Against Napoli, he was playing a double pivot alongside Ramires in an AVB 4-2-3-1. 
* Against Man Utd, he played the defensive role in the 4-3-3 midfield with Lamps &amp; Rami. When Lamps was subbed off for Anelka, he was made to play the double pivot with Ramires in an AVB 4-2-3-1.

Defense is not really his forte. As we have seen time and again, he makes rash challenges, argues with the ref and picks up almost as many yellow cards as Brana. (Fun fact: Meireles had more yellows than Brana last season) - not the sign of a good defensively-inclined midfielder, clearly.

His ideal position, IMO, is a Ramires-role (box-to-box runs/passes) or a Moutinho-role (passing/attacking central midfielder) in a 4-3-3.

No, because we're a society.  Your choices affect other people.  We need to come up with a system to make this work.

&gt; You need to understand that taxation is theft,

Fair enough.

&gt; it's inherently evil.

This doesn't follow.  

&gt; The solution? Anarcho-capitalism; which was developed by several nobel-prize winning economics

I just don't see it as workable, or as the most effective means to better society as a whole.  I also don't think it's stable.  Eventually collectives will form based on group ownership of land.  This will effectively be a government.  When all pieces of land are owned by collectives, then you end up with nation states again each with their own laws.

&gt; Whatever spin you want to put on it. It's taking from people without their will. 

Yes.  All sorts of things are. Do you own property?  What gives you the right to that land?  Did you create it?  What if someone else feels they should use it?  This was taken from us all as a group.

Any argument against taxation can also be applied to ownership of land.  ",0,1340699498,null,0,false,0,c55pkqu,t3_vkdxs,t1_c55pkqu,t1_c55pbrl,null,1429232182,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Cancel it immediately and offer to pay any further balance by cheque once they return to good standing on their contract. Paying by credit card? Tell them you will be reporting them to your credit card provider for breach of contract/failing to provide services that you paid for and persuing a refund that way. Sadly doesn't look like you can get a refund via your bank for breach of contract on a direct debit.

Never accept compensation for the amount they owe you. If you owed them money they'd charge interest and probably bill you for the admin costs of chasing up the bill. Do the same to them.

Tell them you've always recommended them to friends but will be unable to do that in future if they cannot provide a reasonable level of customer support.

That's how I got an apology, a quick fix and £40 compensation out of O2 for a fuck up.

My other comment would be that they've made modifications to your account without your permission. What other information have they given the new tenants? Could be in for breach of privacy if they've said anything. Make it clear that they have broke your trust and you will relay that message to other people (as you have done).

Plus, you've posted here. You could edit your original response to thank them for a quick fix if they do so. That'd save them some face so mention it when you talk to them.

I stated clearly I did not want the upgrade and did not agree to it, my contract is to remain unmodified or cancelled with sufficient notice from Virgin.

I contacted Customer Care not long after, told the lady on the other end, she cancelled the upgrade and helped me file a formal complaint. I asked to be informed of all actions taken, as they happen.

true,ocealot,scottish,Glasgow,"&gt;No, because we're a society. Your choices affect other people. We need to come up with a system to make this work.

Why am I forced to take part in a society I want nothing to do with? If I my choices negatively effect others (I'm failing to see what you mean here?). Then I am legally responsible for them. If they don't; leave me alone and I'll leave you alone. 

&gt;I just don't see it as workable, or as the most effective means to better society as a whole. I also don't think it's stable. Eventually collectives will form based on group ownership of land. This will effectively be a government. When all pieces of land are owned by collectives, then you end up with nation states again each with their own laws.

I agree collectives will form, but they will be communities, not nations. One community may abide by anarcho-socialism and all it's members would pay a monthly 'tax' to use it's roads/schools/police/fire/etc. You could live here and hire all those things privately too if you wished and pay a monthly tax to the council for using it's roads if you own a car, etc. I do not see these communities growing into nations.

&gt;Yes. All sorts of things are. Do you own property? What gives you the right to that land? Did you create it? What if someone else feels they should use it? This was taken from us all as a group.
Any argument against taxation can also be applied to ownership of land.

I was going to write a long post. But this is really anarcho-capitalism 101 and is explained much more eloquently here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism#Private_property

Here's a simple analogy I like though -  let's say I am walking through the forest and I come upon a family, living in a house, far out in the forest. I cannot ask, ""what gives them the right to sell it"" so much as, ""what gives me (or anyone) the right to TAKE it"" you could only take it from them by force, or by making some voluntary deal.So how can you justify using force against your fellow man, to take his house? now when *I* sell you the house, it's because I bought it from him, and he sold it voluntarily and he bought it from the previous owner, etc the ORIGINAL owner was the man who first staked the claim on that land and built it in the first place. why did HE not have to take it by force, from someone else? because there was no one there — he was the first man to stake that claim, therefore no force was involved in taking it from anyone else. When YOU come along and want to take his house from him, only THEN must force be used to take his property away, and that is the practical reality because outside of the use of force or fraud, he will not otherwise VOLUNTARILY give you the house, unless you make a deal with him that he agrees to.

&gt;I had a discussion with some people about this very topic today.

So, that's two threads and a conversation - doing the work yourself really doesn't agree with you, does it?

&gt;They were actual proper adults so it was a very refreshing change 

They used terms like 'Cowardly Custard' instead of providing evidence as well, did they?

&gt;they even understood what a claim was and how burden of proof worked

So you provided links for them, then? To back your claim?

&gt;because I've searched ~~and you've searched and dozens of others on this thread searched~~ and none can be found

FTFY. You might want to stop guessing at what others do and presenting it as fact. You're really not very good at it.

&gt; (they're a much better class of person than you obviously). 

Yes, it must be so annoying when you're so busy demanding *more* proof that you're actually expected to provide any of your own. The affrontery!

&gt;there found this little gem which proved that the main reason people visit London is for night-life, food, museums and theatres, no mention of the Royal family. 

It also doesn't mention the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace or even Madame Tussauds either, so I suppose nobody visits those either, right? Your logic has reached new heights of convenience, and that's before we consider that no survey numbers are given, and the lists appear to be favourite cities and not much else - so that's three or four links now; you don't appear to even be aware of what evidence you're expected to be providing in the first place. And you *carry on arguing*, as if this hasn't been noticed (and commented on) from the very beginning. Go on, mention philosophy again.

&gt;Another nail in an already well nailed coffin.

You haven't actually found any nails yet, despite conduction your replies as if the conclusion has already been arrived at from the beginning. You've now provided three that have nothing to do with (and do nothing to back up) your assumptions. Do try to keep up.

&gt;The argument ended with one of them saying ""Well I can't find any evidence but I'm sure it's true"" which sums up your position nicely: no evidence but a lot of misplaced belief.

That's an odd way of saying 'I couldn't find any evidence of my own to dispute yours'.

&gt;I have to go for a while now and interact with real people for about a month

Be sure to warn them that you don't play by the rules you demand (and don't seem to understand). I'll just have to find some way to cope when you return without any evidence. Again.

&gt;I know of one other person who has claimed the Royal family brings in tourism and I'll be seeing them in two weeks. 

There are actually lots of people. You not being one of them doesn't change this, and so far they can provide evidence. You can't, but to make it worse you're quite happy to dance around throwing insults when you're required to back anything up. Look at your reply to my last comment - once again, you give a very good demonstration of how far you'll go to address anything *other than the comment itself*. And you've done this over and over again. On a public board.

&gt;I'm looking forward to shooting them down in flames just like I did with my friends today and have in the past few weeks with you. 

Of course you will; I'm sure they'll appreciate a good laugh at your expense, just as I have (they've gone from 'some people' to 'your friends' in the space of a paragraph). I'm sure they were most impressed with your usage of my link, after several really lame attempts to insist that it was irrelevant...but not as impressed as I'm sure they were at your assertion that a minority of tourists having no interest in the Royals somehow actually furthers your assumptions despite illustrating the opposite of what you'd like to be true, but haven't provided any proof for - you really *don't* read your own statements, do you? If you consider this sort of thing 'shooting them down in flames', then maybe you don't know as much about philosophy as you like to pretend.

&gt;but feel free to wait while I get more and more upset at being expected to actually back up my guesses.

FTFY. Of course, how will I be able to cope what with all this searching I'm supposed to be doing?

&gt;Quote me line by line

There's a reason for doing this, but you (again) don't seem to have grasped that it goes both ways - mentioning it doesn't distract from your demonstrated inability (or more likely, unwillingness) to address the replies that are produced. Like ignoring my last reply to go on another rant where you produce zero evidence. Again.

&gt;with your distraction techniques

You mean like 'where's your evidence?' :-)

&gt;hell go word-by-word if your therapist lets you, but I doubt I'll read it when I return in late July. 

You keep lining 'em up, I'll keep knocking them down. With no evidence of your own, it's not very hard. With a number of links that do nothing to further your opinion (and actually highlight your apparent desperation), it becomes entertaining. It's still procrastination on your part and nothing else - relabelling only reinforces this. But go on, start another thread. It's worked so well for your opinions so far.

&gt;Your final marks are definitely a 10/10 for persistence but a 2/10 for content and a -1/10 for debating skill (I took one off for the lie)

'Final' marks? They're not my marks, they're from you - and considering your continuing lack of evidence (we're now down to 'my friends say so' from your corner), they're worth even less than your opinion, which you *still* seem to think somehow counts as evidence. And so (instead of providing any evidence at all), we're now back to 'lies' are we? Hilarious. By *your* definition, you win on this not just easily, but totally. Want to challenge this? Shall I quote where you've done it again and again, followed up by responding with 'blah blah' when you've talked yourself into a corner? Or changing the subject, or failing to respond to replies? (see my previous comment for the latest example). Shall we compare how many times I've asked you to quote where I've said or done something you've already decided on as fact despite being obviously untrue, only for you to apparently blank it from your mind when called upon to explain?

TL, DR; My six year old is better at this than you are. But go on, dance some more. I get paid either way :-)

Have nothing to do with society and you pay no taxes.  Taxes are only applied on interactions with others.  Once you decide you want to employ others, sell to others, monopolise community property (i.e. land), then you are voluntarily part of society.

true,ocealot,scottish,Glasgow,"&gt;So before someone gets there, we all have use of this. They get there and declare it to belong to them, simply because they got there first. I see no inherent moral reason they should deprive the rest of us of its use just because they happen to be using it.

**Why private property is better:** Practical experience shows us, that a healthy respect for property rights results in greater wealth for all.  Even the poorest, in a rich country, have higher standards of living than the ""middle class"" in a poor country.  Therefore if the morality is based on what will result in the highest standard of living, property rights wins again.  Even in China they discovered that much more wealth was produced by farmers who were allowed to own property, vs those who farmed collective land, and this realization is what let China to liberalize their property laws, resulting in a greatly increased economy and increased wealth for the entire nation. If taking ""the means of production"" from those who own them, results in greater wealth, then why did that fail in the USSR or other places that recognized collective property instead of individual property? And why was wealth so much greater in the western nations that had more respect for property rights?

**How it holds up morally**: Anarcho-capitalists consider a choice or action to be ""voluntary"", in a moral sense, so long as that choice or action is not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by another individual. They believe that maintaining private property claims is always defensive, as long as that property was obtained in a way they believe to be legitimate. They argue that as long as an employee and employer agree to terms, employment is regarded as voluntary regardless of the circumstances of property restriction surrounding it. 

To summarise, I can see what you're saying. (Are you an an-com or an-soc or just playing devils advocate?). But ancaps maintain that private property is needed to thrive. Therefore, we have made our own rules for property law that the majority of the movement feels would be legitimate, (people who disagree would most likely label themselves as other branches of anarchism). If someone is actively defending a piece of land - I would feel they had a legitimate claim to it, and I had no right to take it off them. This is a rational system I would abide by this because I would also want to stop people from illegitimately (at least IMHO) taking my land.

Therefore property isn't a right, so much as a FACT.  You can only take someone else's property through force or fraud. The point of the acorn?

Out of school at 18 in 1986 with crap A levels, went to Manchester Poly and left after a term (when I couldn't understand the introductory 'Math for Thickies') and started work. Hated every shit job and went to Uni in 1990 and graduated in 1994 into a crap jobs market..and on and on it goes...

Now things are better, but only because someone introduced me to building websites in 1997 and I 'bought' a copy of Photoshop and went out on my own.

But every generation has their struggles - try working in heavy industry or living in a northern town in the 1980s watching EVERYTHING you know get torn down like our friends and neighbours did.

There are very few 'safe' jobs any more. It seems to me (and it's only an opinion based on my experience) that you have to skill yourself up constantly and try and see if you can make it on your own by selling your skills in a more transitory way than ever before.

That won't work for everyone, but also the idea that you will own your house is a dying dream for many - I struggle to think how my children will afford it, especially of they go to Uni and come out with £50K + of debt. When I went I had this mythical thing called a 'grant' -and with working in bars and every holiday, I scraped by. You can't do that now.

The thing that bugs me most (and sorry for this wall of text) is this idea that the young have to get into massive amounts of debt to be educated at University, will not afford a house and the bank have pretty much shut up lending. How we are in this situation is piss-poor Government, piss-poor regulation and the greed of...the banks.

For example, if a settler went to Alaska, and staked ""the entire state"" it probably wouldn't hold up in court, and likely that settler would also be entirely unable to actually fence and defend his claim. He could, potentially, fence and defend 20 acres, but the entire state? so where a person would normally have a legal claim against FORCE used against him (when defending his property) how could he, in that case, claim that force is being used against him, throughout the entire state? Unless he was actually fencing and defending, and working and mining the entire claim. the reality is that 800 miles away, whenever someone else stakes a claim, they will NOT have to take it from the first guy by force, because he wasn't there defending it in the first place

So now, considering your situational ethics (where you set up an impossible situation in order to try to prove a moral wrong is actually right) Alice likely wouldn't be able to stake a claim to the entire Island. Bob could go to the other side of the island, and take some resources, and legitimately say (later, in court, for example) that Alice was never around those parts, he never ran into Alice's fence, or Alice's signs, his section of the island was entirely unworked by Alice and uninhabited by Alice. Just because she may have ""laid claim to the entire island"" doesn't mean that she, in fact, actually did, and therefore, Bob wouldn't have to use force again her, in order to stake his claim on the other side of the island, herefore they are both legitimate property owners there, and neither has stolen from the other.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Frightening research published today shows that 20 per cent of families are struggling to cope financially while another two-fifths are “just getting by”.

Some more elaboration should be giving.

By struggling to cope financially, what does that mean?

Are they struggling to pay rent? Buy food? Keep themselves warm in winter? If so, then yeah that's a major problem.

Or are they up to their eyeballs in Credit card debt? Unable to afford a car? Unable to pay for clothes on a regular basis? Most of these aren't neccessities so it's hard to find it a credible claim that they're struggling to live when it's self inflicted through delusions of grandure. 

&gt;Meanwhile young families are being forced to resort to desperate measures. Eighteen-to-32 year olds with children are twice as likely to have turned to payday loans and 50 per cent more likely to have begun flogging their possessions online than average.

Then by the sounds of it, it's their own fault.

I'll be the first to advocate welfare support, but, if all this financial difficulty is self inflicted due to poor budgetting, then it says more about Society than anything else.

If it costs a company less to hire a prisoner than it would to hire a non-prisoner at minimum wage, then companies have an incentive to use prison labour and this leads to higher levels of unemployment in the non-prison population.

Prisoners can receive less than minimum wage if deductions are made (victim support, possibly a contribution to their incarceration, other taxes, etc).

Yes I agree with that.

But the hourly wage cost is just a small part of the total cost of labour. And lets be honest the total cost must be cheaper than conventional labour or why would you choose to use it? Whether it's tax incentives, or savings on national insurance or whatever else. The government would be subsiding this plan in one way or another to make it attractive.

&gt;If it costs a company less to hire a prisoner than it would to hire a non-prisoner at minimum wage, then companies have an incentive to use prison labour and this leads to higher levels of unemployment in the non-prison population.

Even given absolutely fair entrance into the labour market... it still has the potential to take away jobs from the non-prison population.

Look at Robben, he played LW for us and was quite successful and look at what he's doing on the right today. Obviously (despite his struggles), he's one of the most skilled players in the world, but still. 


Of course if we have an inverted RW, I would want someone a little pacier for those overlaps down the right than Ivanovic.


I think Muniain would be great there.

Jesus Navas could be a cheap alternative maybe, though didn't he decline a move to the Blues in 06 or 07?

But really, I don't know how necessary an RW is--With Torres, Mata, Hazard, and Marin (plus Ramires), we might be better served to get a midfielder and let Kakuta and Lukaku get some time off the bench.

IN:Kakuta, Hulk,  Schurrle, Right back and a CM, preferably Modric but Sahin, Fellaini, Moutinho or Martinez also very enticing if different. 4 non-grown in total, estimated cost: 110 million pounds max. 


OUT: Essien, Meireles, Malouda, Paulo, Benayoun. Sorry guys. 4 non-grown out. Gain: 40 million pounds, wages would be cut though with Essien and Malouda's departure. 




 This way 8 players rotated for the back 4 line: Iva, Terry, Cahill, Luiz, Hutch, Cole, Bertrand and a new Right back.

5 players for the double pivot: Lampard, Mikel, Romeu, Ramires and a new CM



9(an extra because I count Ramires for both) players rotating in the 4 positions in midfield and forwards: Torres, Sturridge, Kakuta, Mata, Hazard, Marin, Hulk, Schurrle, Ramires. 

Plenty of cover there for the FW: Torres, then Sturridge and Hulk and Schurrle both able to fill in if required and plenty of interchangeable in midfield in Marin, Mata, Hazard, Schurrle, Kakuta giving a deep, flexible and most importantly scary attack.

Whilst there is a difference so obvious it needs no explanation between having a death penalty for certain crimes and the systematic extermination of an entire race, let's address your ""point"" anyway.

Should you be able to go to any country in the world, flout it's laws and then say ""well, it's not illegal in my country""? Should laws not be applied to foreigners? Would you be happy with a German driving at 160 MPH on the M1, and saying ""it's fine in my country?""

Or do you think we should only be allowed to break those laws we disagree with? I think outlawing chewing gum is ludicrous, so should I be able to break that law in Singapore? Is the exact determination of which laws are unjust to be left to individual conscience, or will a panel of redditors be convened to draw up some guidelines?

Bottom line. If you disagree strongly with a law in a foreign country, criticise it. Protest it. Campaign to change it (although I personally have a strong inclination to not go around telling people from other cultures how to live). Do not travel to that country, break the law in question, and then act shocked and surprised when the penalty for doing so is enforced.

But I think you may be correct about back bacon, or at least I am incorrect about it having to be streaky.

Traditionally in England, there were two main types of pigs that were kept: pigs for pork and pigs for bacon and ham (American texts talk about lard pigs and bacon pigs).  They were different breeds that were given different feeds.  With bacon pigs, the rear leg was for ham, and the whole side was for bacon.  The side includes both the belly (streaky) and the loin (back).

The only reference I could find specifically talking about either streaky or back was with regard to the Gloucester Old Spot pig which has a ""low belly, particularly full and thick to afford streaky bacon"".[1]  So streaky bacon was clearly used and considered.  Also, considering you'd get an equal amount of back and streaky from each side, I'm not sure where class difference would come into play---bacon has historically been a classless food.  In the 19th century, bacon for breakfast was de rigueur for all people.  And ""in 1901 a railway worker...ate for this breakfast bacon every day, except Sunday, when he had a sausage, and Thursday, when he had ham"".[2]

It seems that bacon and eggs was the original full English.  Every book I looked at talked about it and apparently bacon and eggs (coloppes and egges) is what England is ""famous for the world over"". [3]

I mean many worse-off older workers are in an awful position where they get made unemployed and then no-one will hire them, and they have less time to get a pension together and can't afford to retire and have more expenses but are seen as less flexible.

Equally, the young with wealthy parents will eventually inherit the property and wealth of their parents. Many with wealthy parents are already given deposits for mortgages. The fact that most young people will be unable to buy their own home will just create a situation where there is a small class of landowners who own a lot of the property whilst the vast majority of the population rents.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","One reason that couples might want a civil marriage instead of a civil partnership (neither of which involve religion directly) is that we have signed various treaties with foreign nations that require mutual recognition of marriage.

So, for example, imagine that a state in the US has a law that say:

""in the event that you need consent to medical treatment of an unconscious person, consent must be granted by:

1) Their spouse,

2) or, if unmarried, either of their parents,

3) or, if unmarried and their parents are deceased, their oldest living sibling,

4) or the state Attorney General""

We have a treaty with the US that requires mutual recognition of marriages, which means that, as a heterosexual married man, my wife is covered by the first of those, and could consent on my behalf. If I were a homosexual man, in a civil partnership with my life partner, he would not be covered by option 1, and it would fall back to parents.

However, if we had equal marriage, the treaty would kick in and cover the homosexual man - his partner would be his spouse for the purposes of the treaty and thus for the purposes of US law. Whether this is a problem or not depends on your point of view, but it's easy to imagine situations (disowned for being gay, for example) where getting consent for a medical procedure from parents is difficult (they don't want to know), and the state AG doesn't want to step in.",0,1340722125,null,0,1340722469,0,c55so2d,t3_vlb0q,t1_c55so2d,t1_c55k5w6,null,1429233725,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I would say that although I won't quibble with your figures, the effects will probably be felt more locally than on an aggregated, national level (i.e. a factory shuts down and the employment moves to the nearby prison); statistics don't matter to those affected.

Others have already said that this may create a perverse incentive to increase prison sizes for cheap labour. That's possible, but I don't know how likely.

Gerrard - England's MVP. Heads and shoulders above the rest of the players. Great vision, motivation and inspiration. Worked ridiculously hard both defensively and in an attacking role. Even in the last game, where it was clear he was starting to struggle fitness-wise he kept on going and stepped up for, and scored, a penalty when needed. The perfect captain. 

Carroll - Very motivated and gave it his all. Scored a beast of a goal. Shame he wasn't used more often (or correctly). Should have started in the Italy game ahead of Welbeck. When he did come on he was doing a good job of winning the ball and heading them on for his strike partner. Just a shame that partner was an abysmal Rooney who wasn't prepared to do a bit of running. Also did very well in defence when he was needed. Only downside I can say is he gave away a few fouls for being too enthusiastic with his challenges. 

Johnson - Kept England in it so many times with crucial interceptions and tackles - which I think many people have overlooked. Very unfortunate to not have scored against Italy early on in the game. Knew he'd be under pressure to perform from those wanting Richards picked but I was very impressed with his performances throughout the tournament. 

Henderson - Didn't really play enough to judge. 

Downing - Didn't play but I think he should have. Ashley Young had an awful tournament, after the first couple of games Roy really should have dropped him and tried Downing (or Oxlade-Chamberlain again). Disappointed he never bothered.

Hoffenheim have accepted an offer from Spurs, and either we haven't put one in yet or whatever we submitted wasn't high enough. We'll have to see whether we put in 10m now, and I'm pretty confident that if both clubs enter contract talks then he'll end up with us. The only reason I can imagine he won't is if Tottenham promise him a lot more playing time than we do, somehow.

I'm hoping fans don't keep bringing up Rafa whenever there appears to be a stumbling block or failing with Rodgers. It's unfair on Rodgers and definitely not constructive. There were probably other reasons behind not bringing back Rafa - maybe FSG wanted to start afresh rather than go back to another club legend, maybe irrespective of the system they heard (rightly or wrongly) that Rafa was difficult to work with from a boardroom perspective, maybe they genuinely decided to go with a young up-and-coming coach and Rafa was never on the list.

Also, the new style won't take 'years to come into fruition' - Rodgers got Swansea playing his way within a season. Say what you will about the work done by Martinez, etc beforehand, but Liverpool were already playing possession football and dominating games this season via Dalglish. There's already a base of some sorts in place, and any manager who can't implement his style over an entire season (not the same as having the perfect players for it) isn't worth his salt anyway.

The only thing that makes us a laughing stock is how often we call ourselves a laughing stock. Gylfi isn't a world-class, one-of-a-kind player.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"He's looked very good at Swansea, and he did my fantasy football team a lot of favours, but I'm not entirely sure I see the sense in this signing. He's not yet 23; are we really going to be able to give him the game time to avoid stunting his development?

And while the Vertonghen signing is a no brainer in terms of being what the team needs, signing a player like this with no manager would be a strange move. The optimist in me says to take this as a sign the manager situation has been resolved.

If it's happening I hope this works out well; it's always good to see us sign exciting younger players. Still, I think I'd be happier to see us spending the same money on Dembele, who I consider a more mature player with more top flight experience under his belt and better technical skills.
