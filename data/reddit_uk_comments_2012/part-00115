true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I understand what you are saying. They aren't household names.  I would love Mourtinho, he was the first name i thought when we signed AVB and have thought he as close as a ""same for same"" Modric replacement that is seemingly available.

I just look at it as we are now effectively in the same seat Real were with Modric.  Porto are notoriously tough negotiators (much like Levy) and have no *need* to sell. To me 24mil+ seems a bit high for Mourtinho, not outrageous, he is certainly a player with a ton of value but the price seems high.  We have been down the path of overpaying for players before, lets learn from our mistakes.  

Dembele may not be a ""statement"" signing but he is a very good player who can fill the role of Modric better than we currently are able to.  Like i said he is 30% cheaper than Mourtinho.

9mil is the difference between a player like Hugo Lloris and Julio Caesar at the moment, though the difference between the two on the field may be even wider. 

Plus there is nothing stopping us from going back to Porto in January and seeing if Mourtinho is available.  I think Dembele ***if nothing else*** can be the play-maker we ""need"" to keep us in the race even if he isn't the play-maker we ""want"", personally i think Dembele can be much more productive and an asset to us than people seem to think.

Sure there we changes with Labour but there was so much massaging of figures, the actual improvements in one field were heavily offset by cuts in others. The standard of properties fell considerably under a Labour Government although a period of this was under a Tory Council. There appeared to be more work being carried out on properties yet the quality was appalling and only got worse. This only increased when the Council signed into a 10 year partnering contract with a national construction company. There were loads of internal issues that made this contract highly dubious, but not really surprising.

One thing I really noticed from 2001 was how the paper trail seemed to increase yet its purpose was questionable. More and more time was spent filling out repetitive forms and spreadsheets yet the information appeared to get read by no one and never seemed to go anywhere. 

Again, these are merely my experiences but my colleagues were aware and felt similar to myself.

EDIT: Apologies, I kinda went off piste there. With regard the building of social housing, I would be interested to know how many new homes went up in your area - Yorkshire? - under Labour? 

There were some builds here but on the whole, much of the existing stock was badly restored. The Council, after losing a vote to hand over management of stock to an 'arms reach' organisation, decided to 'trickle' release existing stock that was too expensive to repair. In some cases these were properties of high value and size. Instead of selling these to Housing associations, they were sold off in auction to private buyers.

true,NotSiZhe,null,null,"One common argument for the monarchy, or at least why it should be accepted, is that it does not cost a lot of money.  

This viewpoint is partially based on
1.  The Crown Estates being royal land, and yet the money from them going to the public purse.  This makes a profit of around 200 million
2.  The cost of the monarchy being around 40 million
3.  No/negligible hidden costs.
4.  Tourism generated from the monarchy

There are however problems with this.
1.  It assumes that the Crown Estates would belong to the Windsor family if the UK were to become a republic.  As the land belongs to the monarch but not the Windsor family or any individual within it outside of their role, it would belong to the nation in any republican system.
2.  Although the official figure is a cost of 40 million for the monarchy, their are groups that claim there is a lack of transparency and in fact the correct figure is closer to 200 million.  This larger figure takes issues regarding the Crown Estates and the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall (mentioned below) into account.  
3.  One major hidden cost - the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.  They are private land (and so would belong to the royals even after becoming a republic).  They are however tax free.  The UK loses a lot of money by not taxing them.  
4.  Honestly I think this is the best of the four arguments, as there are no strong/specific arguments against it, just rather a feeling that maybe the UK could get money elsewhere.  Personally I think argument four is correct, but exaggerated.  I'll explain why (complex argument) should I have time to put it succinctly.

I still think even if Levy could get Hulk at 24m (in which case i am pretty sure he would bring the money by hand in unmarked non-sequential bills to Porto) Hulk's wage demands would be frightening (have heard 150-200K/wk as the rumored wages).

true,[deleted],null,null,"From everything I've been reading, he's not clinical (it's okay, neither was Modric) but his pass throughs while moving up the field aren't very good. If he can't find our wingers and forward, how much better off are we really? In the highlights of the United match he seemed very good at moving the ball forward and keeping hold of it but I don't see too much creativity in him. Maybe that can be taught, and maybe my sample size is too small. 

The kicker for me (and the 9m rationalization) is that Moutinho has superb through balls and good final touches, as well as being very creative. I think physically the two players may be at the same skill level but Moutinho seems to have a much better footballing brain, ridiculous stamina, more heart, and a better final pass. 

We're not getting Moutinho, anyway, so there's no reason for me to keep arguing for him! You say january, but I think our closest chance will be next summer. He'll 'only' have 2 years left on his contract then so we'll be able to get him a bit cheaper. 

Interesting thing is that Porto will make very little money off the sale of Moutinho, at almost any price. They'll have to give Sporting 25% of the sell on fee, provided his sell on fee is over 11M. At 23m that's almost 6m for Sporting. That's a lot of money to throw towards a rival! Also, they sold 37.5% of his economic rights to a third party, and that's about 8.6m. So if they sold him for 23m they'd only get 8.4m. 

So yeah, in the end, I don't think Porto has much chance of making any money of this deal.  ",0,1346190381,null,0,false,0,c605oj6,t3_yz49m,t1_c605oj6,t1_c605daz,null,1429760027,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

You don't speak for the majority of the British public either, you speak for yourself. 

Just because you think *your* opinion is reasonable and fair does *not* give you the right to accuse others, union groups, political parties who diverge from that view of throwing tantrums and a superiority complex. 

Also I may point parts of the British public involved who are mostly likely to oppose the policy (namely the people leaving education) unfortunately did not get the opportunity to *vote.* Strangely, we don't allow people who can pay tax, join the armed services etc, participation in our electoral system.

Unfortunately the only consistency between the two games thus far is poor defending, which is seemingly a result of players dogmatically sticking to the new system instead of being wise about when and where it should be implemented (Skrtel's error, Sterling to an extent) and miscommunication (most of the lead-up play to WBA's goals). I'm praying it's just these fleeting things as opposed to a chink in Rodgers' armour that's been overlooked amongst all the hype of his passing game.

true,rdkr,flare-brum,Selly Oak,"Having heard the horror stories about Virgin I ordered BT Infinity for my house on Dawlish today but was told that it wouldn't be installed until **10th October**. This is because a new line needs sorting out and there is a huge shortage of Openreach engineers at the moment (exacerbated by the Olympics and recent bad weather).

As you may know, Openreach do the set up for essentially every ISP, excluding Virgin, as Openreach own the infrastructure the rest of them use (I'm not sure on the details of this but I think that's the gist of it). Obviously 10th October is not ideal at all so I contacted Sky to ask if they would be able to have it set up sooner and they essentially confirmed that it would be similar for them as they also have to wait for when Openreach are free. I also posted on ispreview's forums and apparently this is a fairly common problem and there's nothing to do other than wait.

This leaves me in the position of either going with BT and waiting nearly a month and a half for service or going with Virgin and risking having terrible service all year - I've opted to stay with BT and depending on the type of set up you need this may not affect you, but just a heads up.",0,1346204239,null,0,false,0,c60948z,t3_yydzn,t1_c60948z,t3_yydzn,null,1435688110,1,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,1

It seems to me the implication is that some kids mistakenly assume they can get work without a decent education. i.e. it's aimed at their false judgment about the state of the job market, not their work ethic.

Edit: To bring a bit of international context, Spain has had a big problem with lots of kids who left school early five or ten years ago to work in the booming construction business. Now that the construction industry has proven to be a bubble, these people are on unemployment, and stand little chance of getting into work without starting from scratch, and going back into education.

When I bring young players through, I will always bring attackers because they can move back. When Middlesbrough reached the Uefa Cup final against Sevilla, he played left-back on that run. Sometimes it can release the pressure on players. His job at the top end of the pitch is to create and score goals. But you looked at him in the half-hour against Hearts [last Thursday], he served the ball well, he got forward and defended a couple of times. That is important.""

Rodgers is a very good salesman! Apparently Downing was receptive to the idea which, I suppose, is understandable considering that means he can see *some* sort of playing time.

How can a guy who hesitates pushing forward so much be successful in the midfield of this kind of system?

It is the same problem Gerrard has faced in his career. Lucas is at his best playing in his own half. Gerrard is at his best playing in the opponents half. But now you have a system where all three midfielders are asked to do SOME box to box play. Gerrard can play the box to box style (not a well as an attacking role) but Lucas has struggled outside of Brazil as a box to box CM. This is a system that doesn't need a destroyer.

This is the thing that the so-called adults can't understand about the younger generations -- if you push them, they will push back as hard as they possibly can. We don't like being told what to do, and we certainly don't like being threatened.

If you try and make a teenager or twentysomething do a thing they don't want to do, they'll **deliberately** half-ass it while scrawling the foulest swearwords you can imagine all over the walls and floors. They'll get their revenge in petty and hurtful ways. Or they'll simply not turn up. ""Fuck it,"" they'll think, ""it's not worth it."" Or they'll turn up just long enough to express their *absolute delight* to be there and then fuck off. Of course by absolute delight I mean seething, impotent rage.

**Everything** is about effort versus reward. If the reward isn't worth the effort then the effort won't be expended. Sanctions for not conforming won't help, **you'll only make it worse**. They'll hit back in any way they can. And these people, by and large, don't know where to direct their anger. Do this, and you'll find them firebombing the care homes instead of working there, because in their view, its that place thats to blame for existing so they can be forced to go there.

Carrot, not stick. Help people find work in areas they're interested in.

They are not trying to encourage people to stay in education. They are trying to discourage them from being on benefits. They're trying to save money by taking it from those who have none, and that is an entirely seperate venomous tirade I'll be saving for another time. But even if we accept their stated goals, this is **far** from the right way to go about it. Punishing people who choose to quit education - and yes, that is what this is, a punishment, a sanction, a penalty - will not have the effect you desire.

Moreover, punishing people for not going into further education **immediately after you triple the costs for doing so** is monumentally stupid. It is so massively, collosally blockheaded that I struggle to even believe it is happening.

What they're doing here is creating a gigantic schism, a posionous Us Vs Them mentality, in the minds of the younger members of the population. In our minds, you'll become the symbol of everything we hate. You're the people who force us to go to places we don't want to be, and make us do things we don't want to do, **while forcing us to give up on the dreams we have**, because otherwise you're perfectly content to let us starve to death in the streets while deriding us for being worthless.

They berate people for not continuing on in education -- while making it far more costly to do so. They berate people for not having jobs -- while making people do what could be paid work, for free. And we don't have a choice. What can we do? The non-wealthy, the powerless. We have no way of forcing them to answer for their actions against us. You're lying to yourself if you think any political party is better than any other in this. They are ALL motivated by self-interest, and self-interest alone. So they feel safe in condescending to us. Telling us it's for our own good, trying to turn us against each other by painting phantasmal enemies -- the so-called benefits scroungers -- to distract from the real, and biggest problem.

I can only hope that the spell will break over the general population, and some manner of backlash will snap this country into shape.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"With respect, you are grossly misrepresenting this story to suit your own narrative.

The article itself states that this relates to only a small number of public sector departments - the NHS, the armed forces and the police.  Personally, I'm VERY happy that nurses, soldiers and the police are still receiving contractual pay increases.  I wouldn't/couldn't do their job and, for the service they provide, I think they deserve to be properly compensated for it.  But, to get back to the point, the vast majority of the public sector HAS seen its pay frozen.

The department I work in has seen a complete freeze on pay progression.  Whilst I think the government should be spending its time closing the massive tax gap, I can appreciate that freezing public sector pay is an easy short-term fix.

The trouble is, most people fail to realise that a large number of public sector workers are not actually overpaid at all, despite sensational headlines to the contrary.

There have, so far, been no like for like comparisons between public and private sector pay.  Yes, on the face of it, if you compare me with a generic ""office worker"", I'm doing very well indeed.  However, when you dig down into the detail, you soon realise that my qualifications and skills (I'm a qualified security auditor/consultant) would allow me to earn double what I do at the moment if I went into the private sector.  Believe me, I've checked it out.

That sort of thing, however, is simply not taken into account and we continue to see this skewed narrative which states that public sector workers are overpaid and deserve to have their pay frozen or reduced.

The reason is that if you keep telling people they are worthless scum, many will believe it. Indeed this is the precise problem the black community faced in America and why Malcolm X spoke of the House Negro etc. 

Globalisation and the expansion of university education, and generally the stripping away of the last vestiges of the traditional class structure (i.e. not based on wealth but on pure inferiority) has meant that we now see each other for what we truly are: equals.

 his ability to create space, not on the dribble but in the jockey... Luka was very good at dribbling past players but I've noticed that when he is encroached upon he lost possession... I can't verify Dembele's efficacy but from the clips I've seen he appears much better at that. Further, if Dembele is the man who plays through the middle as the article suggests it will be delightful to see his combinations with Gylfi and VDV, hopefully finding enough space to send Ade through or hit Lennon or Bale on the wing. In the inevitability that these routes are cut off for a cross, its nice to know both Lennon and Bale are comfortable with going inside to adjust the angles/create chances, but it is also nice to know that the outside of our defense is comfortable and capable of playing delicious crosses to those in the box.

I have no end of bad things to say about the council I worked at but the idea that Council's pay better than private sector and hand out pay rises for no reason whatsoever is total BS.  *Some* councils might be doing that, *most* are doing nothing of the sort.

And the private sector has pay freezes?  I now work for one of Europe's largest corporations and have just gotten my annual bonus and yearly increment (and I've only been here a year).  

This continuing ""Oh it's all the public sectors fault"" is nothing more than blame shifting in an attempt to undermine public sector support so the Tories can continue to privatise it, thereby realising their long term goal of paying all the taxes they collect to private industry in return for services that are currently offered on a ""not for profit"" basis by Councils.

true,simonjp,cnty-uk,London,"Three popular reasons:

**1. Overstocking.** Take Colgate, for example. Let's say that Jacques' cash-and-carry  pre-orders toothpaste for 2012, but then a new, improved Oral-B toothpaste comes out that's so good, lots of French people start buying it instead. 

So, Jacques suddenly has far too much Colgate. No-one is buying it from them. So they find a broker and sell it at cost (perhaps even below cost) to the broker, just to get rid of it. The broker ships it to the UK and sells it to pound shops, still far below the original price.

**2. Grey imports.** L'Oreal know that a Briton is willing to pay about £3 for a bottle of their shampoo. They also know that an Egyptian is only willing to pay £0.80. 

So, perhaps they make a smaller bottle to sell in Egypt. Or perhaps they leave out the more expensive ingredients that make the liquid nice and opalescent, but don't affect the way it washes your hair. Or perhaps they don't bother? After all, the stuff itself only costs about £0.50; most of the rest of the money goes on admin, advertising, etc. 

So if an enterprising Egyptian buys lots of shampoo in Egypt and then ships it over to the UK himself, he can still make a slim profit. 

**3. Slimmer margins.** If a 4-pack of Heinz beans costs a shop £0.94, can they make a profit if they sell it for £1? Well, perhaps, if they keep their costs down. If they don't accept expensive credit cards, if they employ people at lower wages, if they don't refurbish their shops as frequently. All of this means their costs are lower, so they can afford to charge less.


So if these are possible, why don't Tesco and the like get their products like this? **Stability**. Like you said, this week's toothpaste is from France and last week's was from the Philippines. 

If this doesn't matter to you, awesome. But to many, knowing that they can walk into Sainsbury's and buy a can of Heinz beans is more important than getting a good deal on HP beans in February but not being able to buy beans at all for weeks afterwards.

If price is the most important thing to you, poundshops are awesome - as long as you don't mind *which* brand of toothpaste, shampoo or beans you get, you can buy what they're selling. If you prefer to know that the L'Oreal you're buying is the same formulation as the one you got last week, keep going to ASDA. And if you're canny? Get the things you're not brand-loyal about from the poundshop and then top up at the supermarket.",0,1346233972,null,0,false,0,c60enbs,t3_z0dqb,t1_c60enbs,t3_z0dqb,null,1429764309,41,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,41

Nickub just mentioned his passing percentage from last game, which I agree was poor. The only problem was that he was left with no options because City pressed so high up the field, so he had to launch to the outside fullbacks.

You remember wrongly then - as the life sentence has never meant ""until death"". Even the old form of transportation to Australia which most people consider a one-way ticket often included a reprieve back to the UK after time served.

The question about jail time though - in my opinion - should be less about how long a person is punished for, but how long it is considered necessary to protect society from a damaged personality until the person is deemed to have been repaired.

Sadly, too much of the crime and punishment is punitive and not geared towards rehabilitation or reeducating the flawed personality that lead to the crime in the first place.

It has to be better for society as a whole to reduce reoffending and reduce the cost of ""just locking people up"" by minimising jail time thanks to stronger efforts at rehabilitation.

I can't shop at Asda because they are a bunch of cunts, and I can't shop at Tesco because they hire homophobic security staff that harass or eject my gay and lesbian friends from the store for holding hands.. so are also a bunch of cunts.

He would know the direction to steer the club, and hopefully does at some point. Although he's reluctant to 'prove himself' at a lower club, I think it would be beneficial to all parties involved to have him manage the reserves or something before stepping into the senior role.

true,kggyrr,pertwee,Pertwee,"In my limited experience, there are two kinds of good scifi: one that explores the cool technological aspects of future science or aliens, and one that is relevant to the human condition. For examples of new Who, we have the Pandorica two-parter that does the former, and the Silurians two-parter that does the latter. Now we both know Steven Moffat does a great job with the mindfuckery of time travel in the Pandorica story. So I'll just expand on the Silurian story. 

The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood story hasn't got the most solid plot, but I love the examination of good vs. evil in everyone's perspective. The silurian soldiers easily resort to weapons, not unlike humans; clearly the human mother Ambrose fucked up big time and ruins the negotiation for coexistence. Ambrose the human mother and Restac the Silurian commander show an ugly side of humanity; Nasreen the geologist and Malokeh the Silurian scientist represent the best of humanity. I don't know the inspiration for the story other than the classic Silurians, but it could be a Dummy's intro to the land dispute between Native Americans and the European colonists. 

Admittedly in series 5 this story and the Vincent van Gogh story are the only episodes that fit the relevance criterium of good science fiction. In series 6 we have the Flash double episode and The God Complex. I agree with you that we need more of those. I can probably list more in series 1-4 and would love to discuss in greater detail, but this is getting too long and wordy already.

Unfortunately that was one of the things that fell by the wayside as a part of the coalition, something which nobody was pleased about.

But politics can't be reduced to some single-issue, text-to-vote, push-the-red-button team sport. If the only thing you gave a shit about when you voted Lib Dem was tuition fees, then you really need to broaden your concerns and look at what might have happened if they turned down the coalition:

a) No majority or viable coalition leads to another general election. My own personal opinion is that this would have resulted in a Tory majority, something none of us wanted to see.

b) Tory-labour coalition. There's been hardly a hair's difference between their policies over the last decade and more, so I would imagine this would differ little from an unrestrained Tory majority.

At least with the Tories chained to the closest thing we have to their polar opposite, they are muzzled to a greater extent than they would be under any other scenario.

If we invested more in schooling, used technology effectively (free ebooks, lectures from experts, etc.), had the universities run worthwhile courses for free, and actually ensured there were skilled jobs available then we could greatly improve our production. Especially now that automation is eliminating unskilled work, what use is there in training people for this?

Bruce Forsyth has a bloody knighthood. The system still had a degree of credibility until that catastrophe occurred.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; They have a petition with over 130,000 signatures asking them to review this contract

Virgin had the ability from day one post-award to launch a legal challenge. This would actually get stuff done and could force the government to look at it again, but instead Virgin insisted on an ""independent"" petition that they knew the government would ignore but made Branson look like a hero. That failed so they have finally launched their legal challenge. There's a professional way to do things and there's the Virgin way.

This is after all Branson's forte - lies, spin and misinformation to get what he wants. I think the man could quite literally murder someone and everyone would say how wonderful he is, demanding he be freed and how he's pissed off the establishment (paraphrased from a comment on the VT Facebook page). He's Britain's Steve Jobs in terms of cult-like worship.

&gt; Virgin have offered to run the West Coast for free while this is reviewed. 

I'm not sure what to think of this ""overture"". I'm not fully aware of who pays what for a franchise (there are premium payments but then there are subsidies) but I just have an inkling that it's not as magnanimous for Virgin as they're trying to say. If First can't take over in December it should be given to DOR (the government company that runs East Coast) IMO until someone is chosen - just to spite Virgin.

&gt; But still they press on with the contract signing.

Because rightly or wrongly they think that they've followed the process to the letter (and I think that's all the legal challenge will test - whether the DfT have been following process and not about changing their opinion of who won) and there's no point stopping First preparing to get on with it if there's no real reason to worry about it, I guess.",0,1346247599,null,0,1346247819,0,c60gfco,t3_yynxl,t1_c60gfco,t1_c60gcl7,null,1429765147,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The End of Time pt 2 was my own personal nadir in the history of the show. It's the one episode I cannot bear to ever watch again. My family ended up throwing leftover bits of New Year dinner at the screen.

Mawkish, self-indulgent teeny-melodrama drivel from start to finish, a circlejerk love letter to himself from an increasingly drippy RTD, with abysmal back-of-a-beermat will-this-do? storytelling, (the Time Lords back! the Time Lords gone again like a pop-up pirate), leading up to the real meat of the episode: an excruciatingly corny farewell tour of all Davies' most-loved companions, extended to the point that it feels like some kind of absurd encore to a grim pantomime.  Poor Tennant dutifully wears his 'solemn' expression throughout, and then, to top it all off, we end on a disgustingly unprofessional poisoned chalice to the new crew.  

Tennant deserved to go out with his head held high, proud and fantastic, not with a regretful whimper.  And how the hell are you meant to carry on from an ending like that?  No wonder Series 5 seemed like a completely different programme - it had to be.

My opinion is that this fucking self-serving ending is what has lead to such a schism in the fanbase, with a dismayingly large number of viewers stopping dead at the moment Tennant left, finding themselves unwilling to move on almost three years later.

I'm *still* stunned at the sheer lack of taste and judgement on RTD's part.  He really should have known better - or been stopped by his colleagues.

I also think he will be used as a sub against weaker teams if we have a lead. That way he can lock up the game and provvide a counter attacking threat.

If it means getting rid of Parker, so be it. I wont be too upset. His hair is fantastic, but his Achilles won't be back to the way it was before. He's also 32, so we should offload him now while we have the chance to make a bit of our investment back. 

VdV I'm bummed about but I think it may end up being a good idea. We're trying to decrease the average age of our squad and get reliable players in. VdV, while reliable when he is on the pitch, is pretty fragile. I think it may be better to let him go and bring in someone tougher. 

Lennon is also fragile, but I think it's much easier to leave him on the bench than VdV. We need cover for the wings (as our drop in form around January of last season shows) so we should hold onto him *at least* until next summer.

They popped up, chewed a bit of scenery (or spat all over it, and I'm looking at you, Timothy Dalton) and then they sodded off again.  

This destroys the Time Lords as credible characters.  Forever.

Well said. 

I've never really liked Sturridge - he's not team-oriented enough for me, and I think we could bring in a player with a much better attitude and outlook.  Sturridge's features are his speed, the strength of his shot, and his (overly) willingness to take shots.  His strengths are all qualities that every PL striker should possess by default, so Sturridge is really quite replaceable.

The Doctor got footage of one of the Silence telling him that they were going to kill him and whatnot, and spliced it into the moon landing footage, and made it so that the Silence was telling the viewers of the moon landing to kill any members of the Silence they see.

Simply put, you pay in to a scheme now (age 26) by the time you retire (age 70+) there will be no money left over for you. This is as true for private schemes, and very likely for State social security in the West as well.

* Sturridge is intriguing to me but just get a feeling it's not likely. And Sturridge's arrival seems to be contingent upon Carroll's departure.
* Theo Walcott is only 23 years old and I feel as if he still has some room to grow and develop over the next 3-5 seasons (esp under Rodgers). I hope we get him. I feel as if we're close.

Fact is, he's not a defensive midfielder. He's not the type of player to get the ball and quickly get rid, a la Obi. So that rules out one midfield position in the 4-2-3-1. He's not a distributor (his passing, frankly, leaves much to be desired) so that rules out the other. He does have lots of pace and probably more stamina that most footballers in the world. That means shoehorning him into the right sided position of the 3 in the 4-2-3-1.

Yeah - that's how it's always been.

It's a posh, up-market household and clothing store that *also* does food, almost as an overpriced afterthought.

The way around most of this is to have little to no brand loyalty and only purchase products that are on 'offer'.  If you've got a coca cola addiction for example you'll be out of luck because that cheaper price for six cans will be promptly replaced by a higher price for six cans when not on offer in order to recoup any profit margin losses the supermarket made during the offer.


The worst promotions are nearly always on fruit, veg and meat.  Rarely are these products at 'full price' and will bear what appears to be special offer stickers throughout the entire year, grapes are a good example with nearly every supermarket claiming 'half price' or similar perfectly legally because there are very short periods where you will in fact find a punnet for £4 but the usual, and the price the profit margin is actually calculated from is the 'offer' price of £2 or similar.

Supermarkets exist to make money and every single promotion you see is merely designed to either get you comfortable in regularly buying the same product or in a few cases to drive the sales of other higher profit margin products (as in the case of the 'loss leaders').

The supermarkets, I think, probably compete against each other for a certain segment of the market, which is different to the segment that poundland competes for, and all the while, they're all probably paying _pretty much_ the same for their stock. Margin in a discount store must be razor thin.

It includes the 6 standard licence conditions that apply to all lifers released from jail, and a whole host of instructions on other conditions that can be imposed.

The basic 6, though, that apply to anyone released on licence, are:

 * To keep in touch with your supervising officer in accordance with any instruction you may be given;
 * If required, to receive visits from your supervising officer at your home/place of residence (e.g. an Approved Premises);
 * To reside permanently at an address approved by your supervising officer and notify him/her in advance of any proposed change of address or any proposed stay (even for one night) away from that approved address;
 * Undertake only such work (including voluntary work) approved by your supervising officer and notify him or her in advance of any proposed change;
 * Not to travel outside the United Kingdom unless otherwise permitted by your supervising officer (permission for which will be given in exceptional circumstances only) or for the purpose of complying with immigration/deportation requirements;
 * To be well behaved, not to commit any offence and not to do anything which could undermine the purpose of your supervision, which is to protect the public, prevent you from re-offending and help you to re-settle successfully into the community.

You will notice that many of these could be considered quite onerous - in particular, the third one means that if you go for a night out, you must return home at the end of the evening, you can't go home with someone you meet up with, as you won't have notified your probation officer in advance. You can't go on foreign holidays, nor can you do work that needs you to travel. You must ensure that your probation officer is happy with any work you want to do - you can't even volunteer to clean a building for charity without their permission.

There are then lots of other conditions; you can be banned from owning a mobile, or a camera, or using the Internet, or going near children, specified places or specified people, or other limits meant to stop you from being a problem.

And that's before you consider an average £1400/yr council tax which is pretty much unavoidable. Plus 20% on almost everything you buy and extra taxes on petrol, alcohol etc.

In another thread a few of us did a calculation and thought that an average person on £23k (UK national average) was paying an effective 30% tax rate. That's pretty damn high for somebody earning such a small amount of money. In a Mon-Fri work week, from Thursday lunch time all of those earnings go to the government. That's a huge chunk for such a normal person to be paying IMO.

Also, didn't George Osborne already announce greater taxes on expensive houses in the last budget? 7% stamp duty:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-stamp-duty-raised

My point is that normal/average people pay way too much. You aren't baller on £50k/yr, yet those people get lumped into the worst category of high taxes and zero eligibility for any benefits. Hell, even on £150k/yr (the top tax bracket) you aren't stupidly rich like people think. Probably have a nicer car and house, kids in private school etc, but those people don't have the power to influence government, dodge tax and get your friends elected like the super-rich do.

Meanwhile we have companies like Vodafone, Amazon, Boots etc and individuals like Phillip Green (Topman, topshop etc) avoiding hundreds of millions a year each and we don't bat an eyelid.

your best bet is official autograph or meet the player sessions. 

there is a reason why these are organized, because players being harassed is a real problem. these guys just want to go about their day to day lives without being chased down. the pressure is especially immense on Gerrard.

The only other player we've signed for 15 million this season is taking about 40k a week, and that's a guy who Rodgers has identified as a lynchpin for us AND is absolutely devoted and familiar to his system.

Rodgers' playing style requires a lot of intelligent movement, strong tactical awareness, and a bucketload of stamina due to the amount of pressing necessary. Walcott isn't known for his intelligence or his tactical awareness, and his stamina over 90 minutes is suspect. 

He isn't someone who Rodgers is familiar with. He is looking for high wages (some report as high as 100k). He has a relatively hefty price tag. By all counts, he doesn't fit the current Liverpool transfer profile at all.

For a lifer, you're not even considered for licence until your tariff is up (10 years in the case of the woman in the article you linked). After your tariff is up, the prison governor meets with judges, probation officers and other interested parties, and they decide whether you're likely to comply with the terms of release on licence.

Note that 6th term; if you're trouble inside prison, you're unlikely to be let out on licence, as the prison governor will be able to convince the parole board that you're going to misbehave.

________________________________


A bloke starts his new job at the zoo and is given three tasks.

First is to clear the exotic fish pool of weeds. As he does this a huge fish jumps out and bites him. To show who is boss he beats it to death with a
spade. Realising his employer won't be best pleased he disposes of the fish by feeding it to the lions, as lions will eat anything.

Moving on to the second job of clearing out the Chimp house, he is attacked by the chimps who pelt him with coconuts. He swipes at two chimps with a spade,killing them both. What can he do?
Feed them to the lions, he says to himself, because lions eat anything. He
hurls the corpses into the lion enclosure.

He moves on to the last job, which is to collect honey from the South American Bees. As soon as he starts he is attacked by the bees. He grabs the spade and smashes the bees to a pulp. By now he knows what to do and throws them into the lions cage because lions eat anything.

Later that day a new lion arrives at the zoo. He wanders up to another lion
and says ""What's the food like here?""

The lions say: ""Absolutely brlliant, today we had Fish and Chimps with Mushy Bees.""",0,1346269741,null,0,false,0,c60mcgg,t3_z0ds4,t1_c60mcgg,t3_z0ds4,null,1429768019,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Or, as I said, run yourself. If there's truly no-one you'd vote for, there's a good chance other people think the same and would vote for you. Even if there's no way you'd be elected, it means you get to engage people with your views - and your views are clearly strong.

Obviously realise that no option is going to be 100% satisfactory. No candidate is likely to perfectly match your views. You have to decide what's most important to you, and prioritise and compromise. That's what democracy is about.

Also realise that everyone single one of us is getting fucked in some way, because again, that's how democracy works. We all have differing needs, and politics is about trying to find some kind of balance. A rich person might hold certain views, a poorer person might hold other views. At any point in time, both of those people will think they're being fucked. Because it's all about compromise, nothing is ever going to be perfect in one person's view.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"&gt;The more I think about it, the more I think that the elements are there for a situation where he would just ""fit"" and come into his own as a player and as a leader.

Why? Yes, he might develop a better footballing brain, but his basic skills of crossing and control are unlikely to improve at his age, especially after so many years under top level training at a top club. Once again, the only qualities from what you have said is pace and experience. The potential that he has is the potential to offset a major flaw. 

While some details are obviously unavailable, there is enough information around for some solid conclusions:

1. He rejected a 75k p/w contract at Arsenal. 

2. No current English international under the age of 30 has moved for less than 15 million pounds in the last 2 years, Scott Parker being the only exception. 

3. Arsenal, having sold Song and van Persie already, are not desperate for money. 

This tells us that he is looking for wages substantially higher than 75k per week. It is reported that he is looking for 100k, but I have based my calculation at 90k per week to be conservative. He is extremely unlikely to move for less than 15 million pounds, definitely not for less than 10 million. This means that he will cost any club that buys him between 34 to 39 million pounds over 5 years.

I'm not so worried about Liverpool. They were atrocious last year, and there's been too much of a shake-up of management, style and players this season for them to have settled in (this is an issue with our team too, mind!).  
  
We're probably lucky the scum have been so utterly ineffective so far. Podolski and Giroud have been really embarrasingly bad, and I'm loving that, but I imagine when they settle into the club and connect with the other players better then Arsenal will really threaten.

Chelsea, ugh, are playing disgustingly well and will top the table for a good while yet.

I think, taking Downing out of the equation (another player who I feel isn't of the calibre but plays in a position in which the cover is much less), that Carroll and Henderson both have large quantities of potential but just didn't reach it. Both were evidently burdened by the transfer sums paid for them, which were no fault of their own. Furthermore, strikers, especially young ones, are always going to struggle. It's a massive step up from Newcastle, where he was expected to perform with his heart on his sleeve and give his all, even if it meant not completely succeeding, to Liverpool, where he must do well, no matter the conditions, or face the wrath of the Kop. The same situation occurred with Henderson too, in my opinion. Too often was he thrown on, as a substitution, or on the right wing - not his natural position - or even both and demanded to perform to a top level, having come from a Sunderland team where he'd had a frankly above average season. What is key though, as I mentioned, is that both had flashes that showed that they could be decent players, if the pressure was lifted and they were given a chance to perform. This was most evident in the Chelsea game at the very end of the season. Henderson and Carroll both had huge games - as did Shelvey - because, in my view, they'd been told to go out there and play relaxed, there was nothing to lose and nothing to really win. I just feel with Adam, at 26, he's got very little to give, doesn't play with any drive and doesn't have the flare that I feel the youngsters show. I think you're probably right about Shelvey and it's really unfortunate that we cut his loan to Blackpool short - although for good reason - as I think those were qualities that he would've developed under Holloway. But alas, he's only 20(?) and, in my opinion, only further emphasises the fact that Adam is being eclipsed by the youth. Sorry for the essay haha.

He's not as good as Suarez with the ball at his feet or as good a crosser of the ball as Stevie but he has pace, finishing and a very direct style of play that would be a huge boon to our starting XI.

You name two Wings era songs, and that's probably because people seem to hate Wings and the sound (which has dated a lot). I will say that Paul is on record as being ""embarrassed"" by Wonderful Christmastime (and that George Harrison used to call it 'Paul's Ringo Song') and admits to recording it for purely commercial gain.

However, McCartney has done some great work on his own. His forays into [experimental dance music with a member of Killing Joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberries_Oceans_Ships_Forest), [his purely experimental work with sound,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Sound_Collage) [his classical work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney%27s_Liverpool_Oratorio)... A lot of people sell him short.

I feel this is, at least in part, because when he's bad, he's god awful and when he's good, he's fantastic. There's no middle ground and as he's got older the bad (and really, very lazy) work has outnumbered the good stuff.

Good player to have with the amount of games we have this season, and one of our midfielders out for a few months. Who's to say that the rest of our midfield is going to stay healthy for the rest of the season?

Of course he's not going to start the majority of premier league games, but with us in Europe and the domestic cups as well as fighting for top 4, why not have him around? He seems content to fight for a place by playing and performing well when he's called upon.

Pretty dumb if we let him go now, especially for that price. He's a good player as long as he doesn't have to make a tackle :p

India has many problems around corruption, distribution of food for the poor, poverty. However one of the ways India can improve its lot is building on its successes.

Of course involvement in goals means something, but it's no good having someone who can bag loads of assists, if when passing out of defence, he opts to lump it 40 yards to a Wigan defender or something.

true,JanusTheDoorman,null,null,"11's big character struggle seems to be trying to responsibly be the single most powerful being left in the universe. As Moffat himself put it (contrasting him to Sherlock) 11 is a ""god who desperately wants to be a man"". It was a complete shock to him that the devious trickster the universe had to seal away for fear of it swooping down to destroy your world was him. Similarly, when River pointed out that where the word doctor had once followed in his wake in remembrance of a wise teacher and healer, at least since the Time War he had been building a different reputation, and to some worlds, being a ""doctor"" now meant to be a fierce destroyer, a warrior. The same way he was amazed that his old enemies were able to put aside their differences and attempt to trap him, he couldn't fathom that the Silence and The Church would work together to try and replicate a Time Lord as a weapon against him.

Without the structure of an uncorrupted Time Lord society, all the safeguarding and overseeing they used to do has sort of fallen into 9/10/11's lap - 9 had to deal with the Slitheen and the then remnants of the Daleks, 10 had to do it so often he declared himself the Time Lord Victorious and ... well, that didn't go so well. 11 though, now has to deal with the fact that he still wants to use the knowledge and power of the Time Lords to oversee things, but that the methods he has to use without organized backing are increasingly aggressive, and that the people he's pushing around are beginning to think that where they couldn't contend with the organized Time Lords, maybe they can take down just one and be free of their influence forever.

I think at some point, 11 is going to fail to contain these forces, be killed, and in that moment wish to have been the man who could have beaten whatever he was fighting, wish to have been the man who could have been, truly, the Time Lord Victorious, and that's who 12 will be. I think the only question here is whether he will attempt to do so on his own, or begin a new Time Lord society under his influence. Either way, I think seeing the effects of being a fully realized, viciously iron fisted Lord of Time will lead to him attempting to purge those characteristics from himself, creating the Valeyard.",0,1346286755,null,0,false,0,c60q846,t3_z11fe,t1_c60q846,t1_c60mgow,null,1429769849,21,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,21

""The UK Border Agency has revoked (withdrawn) London Metropolitan University's (LMU) licence to sponsor students from outside the EU because it did not address serious and systemic failings that we identified six months ago.

We have been working with them since then, but the latest audit revealed issues with 61 per cent of files we randomly sampled. We could not allow LMU to continue to sponsor and teach international students.

We understand that genuine international students at LMU may be concerned.

The withdrawal of LMU's licence means that it is removed from the register of licensed sponsors, and students from outside the EU are no longer allowed to study at the university.

LMU students who are already in the UK with a current, valid UK visa do not need to do anything immediately. We will support Universities UK's efforts to ensure those who meet current visa requirements can find alternative places to study.

If an existing LMU student with a current, valid visa is on holiday outside the UK, they can return to the UK.

New students who were planning to travel to the UK to start studying with LMU are advised not to travel.

A UK Border Agency spokesperson said:

'These are problems with one university, not the whole sector. British universities are among the best in the world - and Britain remains a top-class destination for top-class international students.

'We are doing everything possible, working with Universities UK, to assist genuine students that have been affected and are confident that they will be able to find alternative places to study.'""",0,1346287552,null,0,false,0,c60qe18,t3_z1l5e,t1_c60qe18,t1_c60oix8,null,1429769933,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't mean to sound elitist or crotchety. I'm not saying that all of these new-fangled fans who've come in just for Eleven are somehow ""less dedicated"" or ""weaker"" than those who've been around for longer. Hell, I dropped in when Doctor Who came on Netflix so I'm hardly one to judge.

My issue is not with these fans, but the show's pandering to them. Having catchphrases and memetic soundbites replacing what should be rounded characters. Giving titles like ""The Last Centurion"" and ""The Girl Who Waited"" that sound important but hold no real meaning.

I fear that in attempting to gain this (ironically) mainstream hipstery demographic the show's becoming more and more superficial, electing to seem rather than to be.

I certainly hope that this next season improves vastly from the last, because I have a sinking feeling that the 50th Anniversary could make or break Doctor Who. Permanently.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"&gt;Honestly, I have to ask if that opinion is based on watching to player or reading articles on the internet 

I hate it when people say such things on the internet. Obviously, I feel that I have seen enough of Walcott in match play to make a statement about him, but how am I, or anybody, supposed to prove that? People can claim to have watched every single Arsenal match even if they didn't, how would you disprove any of that? 

Validity of a statement does not rely on its source, someone who watched 2 Liverpool matches and read a handful of articles online can come to the same conclusion that Downing played like crap as a Liverpool fan who watched every match, and both would be equally right. 

With that being said, the idea that Walcott isn't particularly good at passing or crossing, and has poor footballing intelligence is a common one even among Arsenal fans before there was any hint that he wanted to leave. This isn't a circlejerk fueled by one or two select incidents, its a common opinion since he was 18. Obviously it doesn't make him a poor player, but it makes him a limited one. The fact that he doesn't seem to have improved in those areas since then is worrying, it points towards limited potential. Michael Owen is a good comparison in some aspects, though Walcott isn't played as a striker. By the time he was 21, Owen recognised that his pace was no longer enough, especially with his hamstring problems. He started using the threat of his pace to create space and shoot from range. He also improved his shooting on his left foot, his heading, and his positioning in the box. By the time he left us at the age of 24, he was a much better all-round player. Walcott, on the other hand, has remained largely stagnant in the last few years. His shooting has improved, but his other aspects still seem to be the same. He doesn't press well and has issues with his stamina, both very important features with Rodgers' style. 

Once again, Walcott isn't necessarily a poor player, just a limited one. The biggest problem with him, however, is how he will be coming with both a substantial transfer fee and a big wage packet, which isn't something the club wants. He will cost us £40 million over 5 years, and that is a lot of money for a club that isn't expected to finish in the Top 4 this season.

I mean, losing your emotions is only distressing to those *with emotions*. Once you've lost those emotions you can't really feel ""bad"" about losing them because by definition you can't feel bad.

I can't really say ""having no emotions would suck"" because if I had no emotions I wouldn't feel sucky. I just plain wouldn't feel at all.

It would suck for others, my loved ones for sure. I would probably be a pretty terrible human being without emotions. In fact, I could hardly be considered ""me"" without emotions. At that point I just become... well, an animated body.

Frankly I love my emotions (a bit tautological, but you get the point) and would never wish to part with them as I would lose so much of my perception of reality.",0,1346290305,null,0,false,0,c60r0lo,t3_z1sgw,t1_c60r0lo,t1_c60qux9,null,1435687733,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"But the issue is that the time that she waited is not protrayed realistically in her character.

Where Moffat is great at getting *concepts* and *ideas* that act as archetypal puppets for him to use like ""angels that move when you blink"" and ""grey aliens that make you forget them"" RTD was great at crafting *people*.

Amy is a character that supposedly went through four psychiatrists, all of whom she had bit. She made (and kept) Doctor-based memorabilia which she crafted. She wrote books about him and made Rory dress up like him. The Doctor essentially *broke her*.

But when we see her she's no more obsessed with the Doctor than Rose or Martha was. She behaves exceedingly normal and will even defiantly criticize the Doctor as if she *didn't* spend all that time obsessing over him. The normalize the character so much that by the time of Let's Kill Hitler *she's* the rational one and newly introduced ""been here the whole time, we swear"" Mel is the crazy one.

A character that *should* be this broken character with a semi-psychotic fix on the Doctor is turned into a much more audience-friendly ""sassy bossy woman"". Her affection to the Doctor is played just like all the others: romantically. 

I say that the phrase ""The Girl Who Waited"" is meaningless because it is used superficially. They'll pull out the ""I've waited for you!"" card, but they don't give us all of the nuances that the waiting brings. We're *told* that waiting was traumatic for Amy, but we aren't *shown* this. It's a great idea, but the show only takes the superficial shine and catchiness of the phrase instead of exploring ""The Girl Who Waited as a *character* rather than a storytelling device.

And now we've got a cast of twenty-somethings spearheaded by a floppy-haired pale schmuck who all women call ""hot"" on sight and calls dated and non-mainstream things ""cool"". This may be a coincidence, but I find it highly suspect that this catchphrase-tossing new Doctor wasn't advertised without an *inkling* of the demographics to hit in mind.

Is Moffat a true Whovian? Yes, absolutely without a doubt. Does that mean that his definition is the end-all-be-all of who? Does that mean he doesn't make blunders? Of course not.

In fact, I would argue that *because* he's such a fan he's made these mistakes. He slips in ""timey wimey"" and ""x's are cool"" like most of the fans throughout his work (often in ways that feel forced or otherwise shoehorned, again like a fan).",0,1346293021,null,0,1346338295,0,c60rn8x,t3_z1sgw,t1_c60rn8x,t1_c60rg75,null,1429770584,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Then one day, with everything on the line, the Doctor flips, and the Time Lord Victorious re-emerges, with the Master as his right hand man, and they build a wonderful, glorious new Gallifrey, but shut up in his crystal tower, only venturing out to oversee the progress of his new Empire, the Doctor doesn't see the pain and misery that people are suffering under what is really the Master's regime. When he does, finally, it's an echo of previous shock - where ""doctor"" was once a word meaning teacher, healer; and where his lone attempts to set things right led the people of the universe to see him as a warrior and threat, it's only now that he sees what he's really become - to the people of the universe, living under an oppressive Time Lord regime with him as its figurehead, HE is the Master.

When the Doctor confronts the Master, his manipulator can only laugh, pointing out the subtle irony - when last they met, the Master tried to turn the whole human race into the Masters, when really, all he had to do was to turn one man - to defeat the Doctor, he had to turn the Doctor into the Master, and now that the puppet has danced his dance, it's time for him to die.

The Doctor, then, wants nothing so more as to be anyone but the man he has become, he wants it so violently, that his subconscious regeneration mechanisms cannot reconcile his desire with a typical regeneration, and thus, the Valeyard is cast off from him, and we are greeted with 13 - the final Doctor, and the purest Doctor who most embodies the ideals of the show. This is the Doctor as he was at the end of The Doctor Dances, screaming ""EVERYBODY LIVES"", as he was when he sprinted through The Library to save River's memory when he barely knew her, as he was when he spent what he thought would be the last few minutes of his life trying to convince River that being good was worth it. Now, with all that behind him, he faces the task of a lifetime, even for him - to face, again, a corrupt Time Lord society, this time ruled by the Master and the Valeyard, the incarnation of all his own evil and not just destroy it, but to save it, to make it into something to be proud of.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Right, but ""suck"" isn't exactly an objective description. It's very *sub*jective, no?

I'm not saying that life would be fine without emotions. You would lose everything that makes you you. You would be unable to understand an entire layer of social interaction and be blind to a layer of perception.

However.

""Sucking"" depends on you being cognitively aware of your state in an emotional way. 

For example: although I do not wish to be dead and understand that this would terminate literally anything I would do I cannot say that the experience would ""suck"" because it isn't even an experience.

I'm dead. There is no feeling sucky. There is nothing at that point.

Another example.

Doctor Who has been canceled. Why does this suck?

This sucks for you because you enjoyed the show. If you did not enjoy the show it would not suck much like how if Days of Our Lives ended it would not suck for you because you were not a fan.

But you are a fan and you feel sad. You feel in a funk and what held meaning to you is gone. It sucks because you have all these negative emotions that you do not like experiencing.

Now.

The *concept* of losing your emotions sucks for you. It distresses you to know all that you percieve now and all of who you are being terminated.

But the actual *loss* of these emotions would not suck because in order for *anything* to suck you must be emotionally aware of a change and create negative emotions.

Because you are not feeling these emotions you do not feel sad. You do not feel longing for the emotions you once had because you are incapable of feeling longing. The fact that your life would be less rich or nuanced is irrelevant to you because you feel no desire for any of those elements.

So you see I am not disagreeing with you. To lose one's emotions would be an unfathomable loss that would surely drop one into an unimaginable sorrow if they had emotions to process it which they don't so they won't so it isn't (to you once you've lost your emotions).",0,1346293669,null,0,false,0,c60rso3,t3_z1sgw,t1_c60rso3,t1_c60rhp8,null,1429770653,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Don't feel bad. Don't worry that Doctor Who makes you emotional. I'll tell you one good example for myself. I had just been to the funeral home visitation for my Great Uncle. This man travelled, everywhere. When he passed, he was the last in a line of great men in my life. Men who taught me without speaking, just by actions. These were my Grandfather, and my two Great uncles. Anyway, I had gotten back from the visitation and decided to listen to some youtube. Stumbling as I do, I came across the performance of ""This is Gallifrey/ Vale Decem"" From that year's Proms. I decide to listen. As I'm listening, they begin to show the regenerations of each Doctor, along with the crowd reactions to each.  It was around the applause for the 4th Doctor that I began to lose it. I curled into a ball at my desk and started to cry. Perhaps from exaustion from the past few days, stress, I don't know. But something in the music and reaction hit me. I cried through the 4th, 5th, 6th. Onward until we arrived finally at the 10th Doctor's regeneration. The height of Vale Decem. The Crecendo. By now, I'm a mess. I'm a 26 year old man sobbing over a video about a fictional character...but then it dawned on me:

This man, this wonderful man, represented to me a person I could try to achieve. Much like my Uncles and my Grandfather, he was wonderful...he had a strength unmatched, an intelligence unbounded, and a childlike curiosity unreserved. THIS was a person I would want to strive to be like for the rest of my life.

Once I realized all this, and cried myself dry, I felt better then I had in YEARS. I felt resolved. And I know that no matter what, at the end of the day. The Doctor is ""out there"" living his life as he sees fit. And I can only hope that in the end, I can look back and say ""I was fantastic""

It's your deal how you relate to characters, but keep in mind that male and female characters can share all of the same personality traits - and since the Doctor is rarely romantic (there's River now but that's a blip in his overall TV timespan) there's not really a chance to 'live through him' in terms of landing a ladyfriend (ditto with getting pregnant, however that works via TimeLords). I personally don't see a female Doctor being different in any way unless they chose to make her so and they could write a male character the same; she could still be quirky, witty, intelligent, farsighted (in mind), generous, quick to anger, and so on.

It is true that there are few good male role models but there are even fewer overall positive female ones in my opinion. We just need more of everyone it seems.

Along with what 30percentAlpaca said, I think the character (and the show itself) needed a different, more outwardly tough/happy outlook.

Although in someways we could also see Matt Smith's 11th as being less outwardly unhappy, and rather just keeping a tight lid on all of that. 

the four RTD series are all reflective and emotional stories; 10 was receptive but also just... heartbreaking, really... in someways, if the show had continued immediately in that direction it would loose it's action adventure edge. Most of the Moffat series episodes are bright, pop adventures with twists, but happy endings, with those episodes and moments that point towards the deeper darkness of the character (Amy's Choice, the Beast Below, the girl who waited). 

Also, crack pot theory: ""present day"" characters have mentioned multiple times of not being aware/remembering/being present during many key 9-10 events.  It would be more interesting to me if ""what happened?"" tied in to 11s story at some point instead of the whole thing just being kind of logged off for the ease of it. Dimensional jump?

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt;  It's irrelevant whether or not you feel the absence of your emotions.

This is inaccurate. In order to have *anything* ""suck"" there must be an emotional presence. ""To suck"" is an inherently emotional description. In order for something to suck it must cause you to experience negative emotions. IF it does not cause these negative emotions it does not suck. 

Not having emotions *by it's very definition* does not cause negative emotions and thus does not suck. This happens because sucking is a subjective experience one has that cannot be experienced without emotions.

The concept of losing emotions is sad. If I had no emotions I would not be sad so I cannot say that losing my emotions would make me sad.

Now I cannot stress this enough: I *agree with you*. Losing emotions would cause you to lose all of the perception and diversity that we enjoy.

But you said that it would ""suck"". In order for something to suck it must cause you to experience negative emotions. Because losing your emotions does not cause you negative emotions experiencing having no emotions would not suck.

Allow me to reiterate: the idea of losing your emotions does suck. From a third (emotion-experiencing) perspective losing emotions sucks. But to actually *lose your emotions yourself* would not be a sucky experience because you cannot experience suckiness.

That's the most important thing I can stress here, because you are right in the fact that losing your emotions would suck *when viewed from the outside*.

When actually *experiencing* a loss of all emotions you would not feel sucky because you simply cannot feel.

Further, we do indeed know how one can behave without emotions, we see this all the time in simple AIs and basic interactive programming. Cleverbot, for example, can interact and behave without emotions.

However I do see your point. These AI's have a foundation on an impure logic because their very existence is illogical. Does speaking with people online or creating hordes of zombies in a video game seem logical? No, because these are commands fueled by emotions impressed upon these programs by emotion-experiencing humans.

However, yes we can see how things operate without emotions, just not humans (although even then we can observe people who experience very few emotions in the form of rare disorders that prevent chemicals like dopamine or serotonin, which create emotions, from being produced in the brain).

Okay, how about this: Operating on the basic premise that more diversity is a good thing, you can conversely say that the lack of diversity is a bad thing.

And I agree that AI's are far from operating at the level of the human brain. Even the most advanced learning programs *vastly* pale in comparison to the human mind.

To say that any one opinion of ""what sucks about this"" is correct is farcical. There's actually a pretty big fallacy in what you said at the end there, but I think we're both tired of working through logic at this point.

&gt; LOKI: Correct, but I'm sure we can both agree that losing one's emotions would be a devastating loss.

&gt; ME: Oh yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you on that one.

Anyway, for things to suck one must perceive them. The universe does not give a single shit if humans feel feelings. In fact, nobody gives a shit if we feel feelings except us.

The universe would lose nothing if we lost emotions because emotion is an entirely human created concept. The only people who lose are the only people who can perceive and experience emotion: us.

The universe would keep expanding, the stars would keep burning, electrons would continue to cloud around nuclei. Literally everything in the entire cosmos would be physically, chemically, and functionally unchanged in literally every way.

Would there still be a loss? Yes. But this loss would be only experienced by humans (well, not *by* humans.

And you make a fine point that emotions influence actions. But by the same token emotions are not *necessary* to actually create those actions. One can slam a door without being angry.

Without emotion the universe would *drastically* change course, just like any tiny action like a butterfly flapping it's wings ripples out in a perpetual chain of cause and effect.

&gt; A quantifiable, physical loss of variation in the data that makes up the universe. 

Woah. The loss of a variation. Something that's merely a rearrangement of preexisting elements and not necessarily a new element itself, but in it's own way... unique.

This leads me to a thought... what is the difference between a loss of variation and the *lack* of variation to the universe at large? 

There are an infinite number of concepts, influences, and principles that *could* exist but do not. Is this bad? Is it bad that the universe isn't brimming to it's peak and beyond with variations, with new perspectives that even we cannot perceive?

If I invented a new form of algebra and then promptly forgot how to use my method, would this be a loss of variety? 

... If, as you say, the tiniest actions ripple out to the entire cosmos  than the universe must feel infinite loss as people in massive numbers have new ideas and thoughts and processes and variations that are promptly lost to time or death or any number of ills.

And yet at the same time, it must experience constant birth. Perpetual birth even. New concepts being formed and rippling out through action.

Birth and death forever... like shifting sands.

true,TheLushCompanion,mcgann,McGann,"So, this evening the University of Oklahoma Center for Studies in Democracy and Culture hosted ""An American Picnic"", a banquet with Sylvester McCoy. At this meeting he was presented with an honorary citizenship to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma by Jarred Brejcha, the chief of staff to Mayor Dewey Bartlett. McCoy responded with ""I've been a subject of Her Majesty the Queen for 69 years, but I've never been a citizen before now. I like it!"" 

The evening was full of awesome stories. At one point he mentioned that Sophie Aldred had taken him out for their birthday (they share a birthday) to a musical. He told stories about his early days before his acting career. (Did you know he once worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken??) He told the story about stuffing ferrets down his pants. 

I think the best story all night was about how he got the part of Radaghast the Brown. He talked about doing a screen test ten, twelve years ago for Lord of the Rings, but not getting the part. Then he played in King Lear, and met Peter Jackson. Peter Jackson invited Sylvester McCoy to his home for the weekend. About that he said ""I knew I was basically being auditioned the whole weekend. So I tried to be charming, but I can only be charming for a half hour at a time."" Then he looked at his watch, looked up at us, made a rude gesture and mouthed ""Fuck you!"" silently, and ducked out an open door. He came back in as we were all cracking up.

&gt;You prefer a Doctor because of something physical,

I don't recall saying this, I do believe I said IF I did.

&gt; instead of something that's actually part of the show.

How are looks not part of the show? That doesn't even make sense. 
You might not have noticed this but one of the biggest changes between Doctors is their outfits. The 4th Doctors Scarf is an example of this, The 11th Doctors Bow-Tie another. Outfits and by extension the characters appearance have a dramatic effect on the show, trying to trick yourself into believing otherwise is just hiding your head in the sand.


Yes, he is my favorite, but I don't recall saying its BECAUSE of his looks. I said ""IF"", and what I said was in the context, you took it upon yourself to judge (and deem inferior) how others should determine their favorites, which is ridiculous.

&gt;Don't you like him because of something he did? Something related to his character? 

A number of things actually, however that doesn't seem relevant.  Any reasons I do have are probably superficial, or otherwise inadequate. 

Perhaps you could tell me how it is we should all distinguish their favorite, and of course, who is our favorite.  (I assume your calculations return only one Doctor)

He can get 10 goals, and is surprisingly the player who, when things aren't going our way, I can trust to up his work-rate, throw in a few (often dodgy) tackles and get things going - I never expected him to be this player!

However, he will be 30 in February.  Though his game is not built on pace and losing that won't be an issue, I am concerned that his already awful injury record will just get worse from now on.  Splitting game-time with Gylfi might help here, but then you risk the problem of Rafa's ego getting in the way and him becoming unsettled at not being first choice (especially if we're not winning every game without him).

If Hamburg offer £10ish and Rafa would like to move on (and I know how much he enjoyed his time at Hamburg), I'd reluctantly take it.  I do love the guy though, however often I get frustrated at him not imposing himself enough at times.  He's just...so cool!  I think I want to be him.

Source on ownership: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/25/gun-ownership-firearms-certificates 

Also note this:

&gt;The Centre for Defence Studies at Kings College in London, which carried out the research, said the number of crimes in which a handgun was reported increased from 2,648 in 1997/98 to 3,685 in 1999/2000. It also said there was no link between high levels of gun crime and areas where there were still high levels of lawful gun possession. Of the 20 police areas with the lowest number of legally held firearms, 10 had an above average level of gun crime. And of the 20 police areas with the highest levels of legally held guns only two had armed crime levels above the average.

Absolutely incredible behaviour from the government. This will seriously damage the reputation of British universities abroad. I studied with international students a couple of years back, and the visa requirements were already very arduous. Why bother will all of that? Foreign students fund a serious percentage of UK higher education, £12bn a year according to the NUS guy earlier, which is something like four times the entire government teaching contribution. These students will take their talent and their money, and they will go elsewhere.

Edit: On reflection, looking at the figures, [£12bn seems to be over the top](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/09/are_foreign_students_good_or_b.html). That is the 'export value' of all UK training and education. The figure for foreign students is £8.5bn, but that also includes the money they bring in the country to spend on food, clothes, accommodation etc as well as tuition. That data says there are 415,000 foreign students in UK higher education. Assuming £5,000 of fees each (which strikes me as conservative) you get to about £2bn of tuition fees a year, and the government contribution is about £3bn, following the recent education cuts that went through with the tuition fee increase.

I think you can tell a real city fan though, not when we win, but when we lose. You can tell the real fans from the way it affects them, when you see the real emotion, not the mimicked emotion. E.g, guy who threw down his top and stamped on it during the 3-2 heart attack inducer. 

But you get two types of fans that aren't proper fans: the glory hunter and the follower. 

The *glory hunter* you all know, just with teams who are winning because they can't take the heat when they don't win. United has a lot of these, and when they aren't doing very well, you will find these fans ""taking a year off"" or ""not interested anymore"", sometimes ""too busy to watch the match"". 

Then you get the *followers*, these are people who support city just because their mates do. They go to matches because it's a social event. Sometimes it's a family  member who feels compelled to take a side even though they aren't really into it. You can find them at matches looking around in amazement when we score, or after losses telling their sons, ""**it's only a game**"". Girlfriends often fall into this category. 

But none of these are true City fans. No matter where you're from, whether you live up the road or down the M6, if you live and die with City, if you go out of your way to follow the match, either at the stadium or through the media, if you suffered a near death experience last season, and the rest of the world seemed unimportant for those 95 minutes, then you're a real blue.

I mean, you watch the games because you enjoy the way we play, elegant and beautiful. The games are fun to watch. You enjoy the wins and the losses probably make you feel shitty and disappointed, and you get annoyed when you get called a glory hunter. 

But some of the reasons you like watching the team play are related to glory hunting, not in the sense that you just want to go ""champions! champions!"", but because they are the most enjoyable team to watch, and so you follow them. The real question is, if you'd of watched us say, 5 years ago, or 10 years ago, when we weren't as good, when we were one of those teams that frustrates you, like watching Arsenal without any strikers, or watching a Stoke game where they have no technique, *would you still have continued to watch us?*

At the end of the day, everyone starts supporting the club for different reasons. For me, when I was a kid (5 years old?) my older brother converted from United (my dad imposed this on us), and I followed. At the time, all I really did is go from saying ""go united"" to ""go city"", *I didn't really understand it*, but then as I grew up, I grew up a blue. I grew into city. Fast forward 7 years and I was already bred into hating united, and loving city. It takes time, but you become part of the club.

Some people don't follow a club from birth, some people join later, and when you do people are always going to hold that against you. Most likely though it will be people from other clubs that do so. And it's because of the signs of glory hunting in the circumstances of your following that they will grab onto, and play it into looking like a conscious decision. We have a saying for people like that though, it's *fuck off*.

If we lost our backing, like Drogba's club, Shanghai Shengahi or something, and lost our players, and played like shit, fighting for relegation, and you still watched us, then you'd be a true blue. If you stopped being as interested in football, or you couldn't find time, or just maybe started to watch another club, then you will not have been a true blue.

For now, who knows. The judgement day isn't here yet, and hopefully won't be for a very long time. But when it does come, you will know whether your blood is red or blue.

The terms Union Flag and Union Jack are **both** historically correct for describing the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom. Whether to call it the ""Union Flag"" or the ""Union Jack"" is a matter of debate by many. According to the Flag Institute, the vexillological organisation for the United Kingdom, ""the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack.""[4] The Institute also notes:

*It is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. In 1908, a government minister stated, in response to a Parliamentary question, that ""the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag"".*

Several times we were placed in group projects with overseas students who didn't even have a rudimentary grasp of English beyond 'yes' and 'no' - yet home students had to attain at least a B at English A-level for admission. How is that fair? We ended up carrying that particular student for the whole project in most cases.

In addition to the above, there's a huge number of 'English language colleges' and 'Business schools' operating as mere fronts for immigration. Have a look at Cheetham Hill in Manchester - an area with traditionally high levels of immigration - it has a load of these so called 'colleges' located above kebab shops and immigration solicitors offices and they look *nothing* like any college I've ever seen, comprising of two or three rooms in a dilapidated terrace.

SpaceToad has already answered a lot of your questions. North Stand Chat is an excellent forum, and fan site wearebrighton.com also has great articles, match reports, photos, and such. The official club website seagulls.co.uk has all the latest news and updates for following. Also if you wish you can buy a subscription to Seagulls Player on there which is a few pounds a month where you can watch extended highlights of all matches, match interviews, etc. Do you have Twitter? If so follow @OfficialBHAFC, @northstandchat, @wearebrighton, and @BrettMendoza. From there you'll find other good accounts to follow too. For following the league itself, every Saturday late at night there is the Football League Show which shows highlights of all the matches in Brighton's league, including Brighton's match itself of course.


The core things to know? You've already been told about Crystal Palace. Our nickname is the Seagulls or Albion and at matches we have a variety of chants, you'll pick them up soon enough. I don't know if you know that Brighton is often considered the ""gay capital"" as we have a large LGBT community here- the result of this is that the away fans often make rude/homophobic chants about Brighton fans being gay (""We know why you've got soft seats"", ""Does your boyfriend know you're here?"", ""We can see you holding hands"" etc). Our manager is called Gus Poyet, he used to play for Chelsea and after retiring from playing came to manage us, when we were struggling in the league below where we are now, at the Withdean Stadium mentioned in SpaceToad's comment. He's already a club legend, having taken us to champions of League One in his first full season (this was 2010-11) which got us promoted to our current league the Championship. Our first season in the Championship was a great one, we finished 10th out of 24, which is also where we currently stand after three matches of the current season. 

If you have any other questions about the club, PM me! I'd be more than happy to help a new fan out.

My bill was £65 more expensive (on top of the normal £35 monthly) but they said they couldn't do any kind of payment plan - I had to pay it all in one lump sum, which was quite a big shock to the budget.

While this isn't a first team signing it just matches up with what I was saying earlier about LFC not making marquee signings this year, especially not 29 year old expensive marquee signings. Long term project, we don't need the short term impact.

Sign 3 or 4 young guys rather than one older player who has 4 years left in him. If only one of them work out you have 10 years of playing time from a star and from the rest you have resale value.

Not to mention the overall lower wages

As an aside, No rumors on the deal again. Same with Assaidi. If you still believe the 'ITK' accounts on twitter now after two deals that weren't linked in the papers then there is no hope for you

1. I feel like this isn't a very valid point; a person likely to be doing illegal activities would claim £56 a week and already be doing them at the same time, I don't think this would cause someone to snap and just start selling drugs.

2. Charities can take on additional people to help out that they wouldn't be able to pay (I don't think this is  slave labour but I really cannot be bothered discussing that). I think a better option then sending people to local businesses would be just charities or duties that the council provide such as street cleaning or gardening.

3. This is for people claiming job seekers allowance and so it's for someone who has not been able to find a job post degree (another discussion about useless/ too many people doing certain degrees could be made here)

Working for charities is one thing, but if private companies are part of the scheme, then they're just getting free labour.


**edit**- Finally, the main reason most people are on benefits isn't because they can't or won't work, but because there are no job vacancies they are qualified for.

The Pay Consortium is totally seperate to the Liberation Bill and the unions, or Unison, at least, which seems to be the main union at Bournemouth Hosp, have opposed both of these. With startling incompetence, of course, but they've not been on board with either.

From what I can tell, and from what I've seen at RBCH, the people at the top aren't interested in cutting pay or holidays or any of that stuff. Why would they be? NHS morale is low enough as it is and they know what will happen if they lower it any further. More important than these items is, for example, stopping people on long term sick from receiving unsociable hours payments, and limiting the sick pay you can get when you're in the first six months of employment. Agenda for Change is set nationally and is too inflexible to allow this sort of local decision. This hypocrisy is picked up in the article too; they attack both the Consortium and Agenda for Change - what exactly do you want? The former is trying to correct the latter. Either engage constructively or go and work for the private sector (less holidays, worse conditions, shorter notice if you're sacked, no lovely warm feeling inside from healing the sick).

As for the Liberation Bill... you should have kicked off earlier. Not that it would have done any good, since both the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nurses (ie all the doctors and all the nurses in the country) motioned against it. Too little, too late.

About 5 minutes after that call I get a text and email from BT congratulating me for my new working BT line. Nope, not working at all!

I log in to the BT website and file a repair request. I am now told the fault is at the exchange and not at my house. Good stuff, the line will now be connected on the 21st of August.

That day comes and goes, my phone line still isn't active. I have a general moan on Twitter, a BT rep sees my tweets and gets in touch with me and arranges for someone to come out on Saturday morning (25th). But now BT's fault diagnostic page is telling me that the problem IS at my house, which is the fault I put in on the first day they came to fit everything. They'll be charging me £99 to fix it if it is at my property (which I was told it was).

The technician found the fault, it wasn't at my property, it was at the mast outside. I don't know if I'll be charged for that.

The technician who came around on the Saturday said he has the skills to fit in the broadband, but it hasn't been activated at the exchange yet so there's no point in doing it. BT will have to arrange another appointment to get that sorted.

The BT rep I spoke to on the phone told me he'd call me back on Monday (27th) to confirm the phone line is working and can arrange for someone to come and fit the BT Infinity router, he said he would make me high priority because of all the hassle caused. Monday comes and goes, Tuesday comes and goes, see where I'm going with this? Still no phone call to let me know when it's going to be done.

The worse part about all of this is, they're billing me from the 16th of August for BOTH services. I can't fucking believe them if I'm honest.

It's just so unfair on him that it all comes down to his price tag. He didn't have any say or control over it. It seems like BR does respect his talent as he does play him but the situation with the club and having him 3rd choice striker isn't ideal for the club. 

If anything, I believe in my opinion of course he should have a solid chance this season to prove his worth. Worst case scenario, he gets sold within a year or six months.

Moffat has come up with the Weeping Angels and The Silence, probably the 2 scariest creatures in the Whoniverse IMO, so saying his writing lacks originality is a bit over the top. Also, looking over the episode list, I think they've only appeared twice in Series 5 (once as the main antagonist), and I don't recall them appearing in Series 6 at all... Hardly overdone.

Moffat has come up with extremely complex storylines and tied them together beautifully, had some amazing dialogue, created awesome creatures, and fostered interesting relationships from the characters.

Polite but firm, always ask for the manager &amp; if they are useless, their manager. Keep going up, politely explaining your problem but not taking any shit. Keep calm and reasonable, but firm - don't accept any ""we'll call you back"" bullshit, and always push your point home.

[Senior player loans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.#Out_on_loan) and [reserve player loans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.#Out_on_loan_2). A few names missing, but you got the big ones.

My take on any remaining transfer business:

With the signing of Moses, I don't think bringing in any more winger/forward hybrids make any sense. I don't see any of them performing very well as a lone striker, and we have enough players that can play behind the striker. At this point, if we want cover for striker, we should sign someone who is actually apt at playing loan striker, because they won't be getting a lot of playing time otherwise. For me, bids for Schuerrle and Hulk no longer make much sense. Hulk is debatable because he could arguably walk into our starting eleven on the right side, but I don't think Schuerrle could do that.

That said, we have lots of up and coming talent at CF (Sturridge, Lukaku, Piazon, Bamford, Feruz) in addition to Torres. Outright buying someone at this point in time, especially with the way Lukaku is looking on loan, will most likely hinder us and destroy any sort of balance in the squad. Bids for Cavani, Falcao, Lewandowski, Remy, Jovetic even don't make a whole lot of sense for the long-term, but I can see the benefit for this season alone. If Remy/Jovetic are fairly cheap though, I could be tempted.

Something that hasn't really been discussed is a loan move for a striker. It could solve the short-term problems we have without really impacting the team in the long run. The only problem there is that, no one is really available on loan. Seems like we have ourselves a bit of a dilemma then, we'd be wise to bring in someone with a bit of experience but a high priced newcomer seems unlikely.

There's also calls to bring in a new central midfielder, but I think that's highly unlikely at this point. Modric wasn't coming to be sold to us, Sahin has moved elsewhere, Fellaini won't be sold or want to leave, very few good options out there. I think our long-term plan here is to develop that deep-lying playmaker, be it Oscar, McEachran or even KDB maybe. Given the amount of wide players/attacking midfielders we've signed, Ramires could also be moved back. I think we're pretty solid here and won't see any new players incoming for CM.",0,1346340176,null,0,false,0,c60z29s,t3_z2ld5,t1_c60z29s,t3_z2ld5,null,1429774152,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

They don't throttle P2P traffic.

They don't use traffic shaping to throttle your speeds at peak times.

Their customer service is outstanding and they care about existing customers: my household currently pays the same price for our internet as we did 5 years ago. Buying a similar deal today would cost about 3 pounds a month more, but they haven't passed those price rises onto existing customers.

They have had one line outage where railroad workers cut through their line.

They are constantly investing in their backbone, adding more redundancy into their system so an outage in one area doesn't knock out other surrounding areas.

true,BristolShambler,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol,"We have 2 houses, the house of commons and the house of lords. The commons is the most prominent house, and is the one that actually writes the acts &amp; laws. It is made up of MPs (Members of Parliament), one from each constituency across the country. The important difference to the USA, is that technically, when you vote in Britain you are just voting for your local MP, and then the party with the most MPs in Parliament forms a government. so we don't directly elect our Prime Minister, although this is a bit of a technicality, as all of the parties have a leader who is presumed to be their candidate for PM.


The main parties are:


Conservatives (aka the 'tories')- Economically similar to the Republican party, but these days marginally more liberal for social issues. Popularly seen as being full of posh people, and very traditionalist. 



Labour- Essentially the Democrats. Traditionally have Socialist leaning economic policies and are the guys responsible for our nationalised health service. Unlike in the USA, the major left wing party here has historically gained a lot of support from the working class (as you would expect from the name). These days the class distinctions between parties don't mean very much though, as blair dragged Labour away from the left wing in the 90's, and Labour &amp; the Tories became quite similar in policy.


Lib Dems- Originally devised as being Socially and Economically Liberal, so left wing, but favouring a free market. This isn't really the case anymore, and since starting a coalition government with the Tories it's been a bit hard to tell what their policies actually are. Previously most of their appeal was essentially just from being a third party.


Other smaller parties include UKIP (an isolationalist party who principally call for a withdrawal from the EU), the Green Party, and the BNP- who are far right anti immigrant xenophobes.


Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland also all have nationalist parties that are calling for the breakup of the UK.",0,1346341402,null,0,false,0,c60zebi,t3_z2q4j,t1_c60zebi,t3_z2q4j,null,1429774311,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
