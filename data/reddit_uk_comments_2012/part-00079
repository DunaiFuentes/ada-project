true,kingofbiscuits,uk,United Kingdom,"Singapore has a low crime rate because people know that if you break the rules you get in trouble, there are no exceptions or free passes, no bending of the rules so 99.9% of people are compliant and follow the law.

I'm aware of the apparent human rights concerns but for one I never saw any free speech issues, there's a vibrant opposition party to the PAP (ruling party) and people can freely demonstrate in public and join alternative groups.

The only thing that isn't tolerated is disobedience, not only from a governmental perspective, but a cultural one. Intelligent discourse is welcomed in all circles.

The press is one area I will agree on however, for example, compared to the UK the press certainly is not as free or open - however, in an internet age younger generations are more active online anyway and the only thing prohibited online is pornography - and even that is super easy to get around.

There has been something of a change recently in Singapore as the old guard (Lee Kuan Yu and Go Chok Tong) have both stepped down - and liberty is becoming a hot button topic and progress is being made.

Lee Hsien Loong (who is Lee Kuan Yu's son) is the new PM and has been making welcome changes to keep the younger generations happy as social perspectives are changing.

One area Singapore does really well is CPF and housing.

In singapore CPF is like your personal tax account so when you earn they take a slice of your wages and put it in there for you. Income tax is only a few percent once you cross the threshold anyway.

CPF pays for your medical bills, housing/mortgage, schooling etc etc. They also give you a few thousand dollars when you have a baby and contribute towards your first home to get you on the ladder.

Make no mistake, singapore is not a dictatorship dystopia. It's a civil and obedient place where enterprise and capitalism flourish - hence the riches.",0,1340727484,null,0,false,0,c55u22e,t3_vmfrm,t1_c55u22e,t1_c55tqok,null,1429234373,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Due to conditioning, people think the spoon is a spoon and can't see that the powerful spoon-users have turned their spoon into a tool of oppression.

Some people understand this complexity, that spoons have been co-opted for malign purposes. Maybe there is no point in saying anything because most say to the spoon-understanders, *hey, you are crazy, the spoon is a spoon, no one is up to anything with it*.

Emiratis are extremely racist, especially towards Britons. Supposedly the UAE jails more Britons than anywhere else in the world apart from Thailand and of course the UK. While selling drugs here is undoubtedly a very stupid idea, it is not clear that the penalty for selling weed was death, I've lived here my whole life and I knew that the minimum sentence was 4 years but I didn't know about the death penalty. The government and media likes to keep things like this very quiet and avoid mentioning the ridiculous drug laws, so a lot of us are largely unsure of the exact details. The arrivals areas in the airports are NOT filled with warnings about this, Sheik Mohammed would never want to scare away his precious tourists with signs saying ""The penalty for selling cannabis is death"" as soon as they enter the country. There is also a massive drinking and partying culture here, often encouraged by local businessmen as it contributes massively to their profits; the law here is hypocritical.

Expect to pay around £400 a month plus for a single bedroom flat, maybe £300-400 if you find someone with whom you could share a 2/3 bedroom flat.

Traditional student areas are Newington, the Pleasance, Tollcross and Marchmont however anywhere around the Meadows will be affordable and studenty.

OK, it seems I misunderstood your comment.

&gt;Having kids is not a career, you should not get one penny for it.

I disagree. My generation is responsible for helping the next generation to develop. We pay tax to provide free primary and secondary education to kids, and rightly so: we want an educated workforce in the future. 

The details are ... a bit tricky though. We pay parents who take the piss, and parents who are completely dysfunctional. In a way this is fair enough: it's bad enough for a kid to have dysfunctional parents without being destitute and possibly homeless as well. But dysfunctional parents tend to bring up dysfunctional kids. How do we break the cycle?

If the next generation is collectively the responsibility of us all, in theory we should all help raise the kids of dysfunctional parents. But the government has a terrible track record when it comes to bringing up kids, and isn't even very good at deciding which parents are dysfunctional. I don't think I want to extend their involvement.

So I don't have a solution, but I'm pretty sure just taking away the money isn't the solution.

Here's what I've heard:


*Why is he selling?*

He's ill

His wife is ill

It's too expensive to run

He feels he's taken it as far as he can

The offer is too good

*Why is it taking so long?*

Bates wanted to stay on the board.

The accounts were done in a very complicated fashion.

*Who is going to buy it?*

Bernard Arnhault - very rich- if only!

Rich Spanish bloke - if only.

Middle eastern group. Likely. Rumoured to be seen around the stadium.

An Australian, life long Leeds fan. Previously tried to buy the club, asking Bates to name his price. Viduka may be involved as a go between. Likely.

The Sikh who previously tried to buy the club in 2003. Leeds fan. Likely.

Ken Griffin. Runs a hedge fund, very rich. Outside chance.

I'm assuming we are likely to hear the result this weekend or Monday, something to do with payment of wages I think.

true,tinyphotographer,tennant,Tennant,"While I didn't necessarily like Donna from the start, she grew on me as the show went on. She never will be my favourite but I felt bad for when and how she left.

What I like about Donna is that she is a very human character. She's loud, rude, and in your face. She is just plain annoying. But it's all a show. She is very insecure with herself and feels ignored. She puts on a brave and arrogant front to hide the way she truly feels.

Donna, in the beginning, is meant to be annoying. You aren't supposed to like her the way you like Rose, or even Martha. It's her transformation throughout her appearances that makes her more likable. You see a sad, unimportant woman yelling out trying to get some attention. And that's why she needed the Doctor. He taught her that everyone is important and he gave her self confidence. She is the anti-Rose, you could say. 

Rose already knew, instinctively, that she was destined for more than being a shop girl, but her mother was holding her back. Her mother told her to be content with working life because she didn't want Rose to leave her. So, when we meet Rose, she is restless and unsure of life but knows that this isn't what she wants. That's one of the reasons she travels with the Doctor (I have more reasons, but I won't go too in depth). Rose didn't need the Doctor to teach her anything about herself, she knew. 

When we meet Donna, she is a woman who is content with working as a temp just to be in a posh area. She wants to marry someone she doesn't love because she wants security and affection. And she thinks this will make her mother happy. Her mother is disappointed in her and goes to no effort to hide it from Donna. She abuses Donna and makes her feel small and insignificant because she isn't doing more with her life. Enter the Doctor. He shows her the wonders of the world and teaches her that everyone is important. He makes Donna feel better about herself and in turn, Donna becomes a better person. She's still plucky and rude but she is a more confidant person.

Donna is relatable. Her character is very human. That's what I like about her. Also, she's funny. And I like the fact that she doesn't fall in love with the Doctor but she sort of challenges him and calls him out on things.

&gt; If it were possible to construct huge gasometers and to draw together and compress within them the whole of the atmosphere, it would have been done long ago, and we should have been compelled to work for them in order to get money to buy air to breathe. And if that seemingly impossible thing were accomplished tomorrow, you would see thousands of people dying for want of air--or of the money to buy it--even as now thousands are dying for want of the other necessities of life. You would see people going about gasping for breath, and telling each other that the likes of them could not expect to have air to breathe unless they had the money to pay for it. Most of you here, for instance, would think and say so.

&gt; Even as you think at present that it's right for so few people to own the Earth, the Minerals and the Water, which are all just as necessary as is the air. In exactly the same spirit as you now say: ""It's Their Land,"" ""It's Their Water,"" ""It's Their Coal,"" ""It's Their Iron,"" so you would say ""It's Their Air,"" ""These are their gasometers, and what right have the likes of us to expect them to allow us to breathe for nothing?"" 

&gt;And even while he is doing this the air monopolist will be preaching sermons on the Brotherhood of Man; he will be dispensing advice on ""Christian Duty"" in the Sunday magazines; he will give utterance to numerous more or less moral maxims for the guidance of the young. And meantime, all around, people will be dying for want of some of the air that he will have bottled up in his gasometers. And when you are all dragging out a miserable existence, gasping for breath or dying for want of air, if one of your number suggests smashing a hole in the side of one of the gasometers, you will all fall upon him in the name of law and order, and after doing your best to tear him limb from limb, you'll drag him, covered with blood, in triumph to the nearest Police Station and deliver him up to ""justice"" in the hope of being given a few half-pounds of air for your trouble.'

I'll just quote myself:

&gt;Or are they up to their eyeballs in Credit card debt? Unable to afford a car? Unable to pay for clothes on a regular basis? Most of these aren't neccessities so it's hard to find it a credible claim that they're struggling to live when it's self inflicted through delusions of grandure.


&gt;These are the cultural values that need to change if we're to get through this crisis.

Well clearly, but there's a difference between someone who is struggling to live due to low wages, as in, can't afford food for example and someone who is struggling to keep a lifestyle they want because there finances won't allow them to.

The first one is an issue that the government needs to address, but since it's more likely the second one, where peoples greed is causing them to make irrational decisions, then that's an issue that needs to be addressed individually.

It's not the Governmen'ts or Media's fault if someone buys an Iphone by taking a payday loan, it's their own fault and they should face consequences and not expect the welfare state to fix it for them.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"**NOTE: Sorry for the long-post. This is actually the shortest answer I could write. :(**

1. Yes. The rules for the English PL and the UEFA competitions are slightly different however.

    A. The rules of English PL state that a team can have a maximum of 25 players who are over 21 years of age in any given season. Of these 25 players, **at least 8 should have trained with any club within the English FA jurisdictions** between the ages 15 &amp; 21 for 3 years. 

    If a team cannot fulfil the above criteria, then an equal number of spaces must be left in the squad selection. 
    In other words, a team playing in the English PL can field a **MAXIMUM of 17 foreign players** in a 25-man squad i.e. players who do not fulfil the above criteria. All players **under the age of 21 automatically qualify** and do not need to be included in the 25 man squad sheet.

    B. The UEFA rules state that a team can have a maximum of 25 players who are over 21 years of age in any given season. Of these 25 players:

        - at least 4 should have trained within the country (i.e any club within the English FA jurisdictions) between the ages 15 &amp; 21 for 3 years 
        - at least 4 should have trained with the same club between the ages 15 &amp; 21 for 3 years. 

    An **unlimited list (called the List B) of players under the age of 20^* who have trained for at least two years at the club**, can be submitted. If a team cannot fulfil the above criteria, then an equal number of spaces must be left in the squad selection. 

    ^(* This is why Lukaku, Piazon, Bamford, Feruz, Davila, etc. do not qualify for any of the UEFA matches as List B this year. They must included in the 25-man squad sheet to be able to play.)

    In other words, a team playing in UEFA matches (Champions league &amp; Europa League) can field a **MAXIMUM of 17 foreign players** i.e. players who do not fulfil the above criteria.

    ***The UEFA rules apply to all countries for all UEFA competitions irrespective of the rules applied/employed by their individual national leagues.***

2. Every league has its own rules. I am not well-versed with the other leagues so I can't give you a comparative example, sadly. Although, if I am not mistaken, I believe the Spanish Liga BBVA only allows 2 foreign (non-European) players in a squad. The term European here, however, applies to all football clubs that fall under UEFA jurisdiction which allows the Spanish teams a bit of leeway, of sorts.

    So a Spanish club can have a 25 man squad of purely Portuguese, German, Italian, Turkish players and yet be able to compete in the Spanish league. For example, Iker Casillas is the only club-grown player in the Real Madrid first-team. However, Real Madrid still has to comply with the UEFA rules, which is why you will see academy names like Antonia Adan, Pedro Mendes, Joselu &amp; Jese in their 25-man UEFA squad-sheet.

3. Red cards, injuries &amp; all such absences are respectively applied to the corresponding competitions. For instance, a player red carded in a PL match still gets to play in the UEFA matches as long as he is registered in the 25-man squad and isn't suspended in that competition as well. 

    In case you were wondering if a suspended or injured player can be 'temporarily substituted' in a squad sheet, well, it doesn't work that way. **Changes to the registered squads are not allowed during the season except at the end of the January transfer window where a maximum of three 'substitutions' are allowed**. 

    (Yeah, if all the registered 25 players are unavailable thru injuries or suspensions, the team will have to play subsequent matches with the players registered in the 'unlimited' list or 'List B' until players from the original 25-man squad become available again.)

    Also, a player who has already played for a team in a cup competition cannot compete for another team in the same cup competition.

Hope that answers your question. :)",0,1340740421,null,0,false,0,c55xlg0,t3_vmg9i,t1_c55xlg0,t1_c55wdpf,null,1429236050,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Many, many of us used recreational drugs in our youth and as far as I can see the UK isn't suffering the devastating effects of the popularity of drugs in the 90s and 00s.

You're confusing a small minority of addicts and abusers who fall off the rails with the average user.  This guy was stupid, you don't sell weed in Dubai because it's far too high of a risk but to suggest that he was likely supplying other, hard, drugs is a real stretch of the imagination given the difficulty he must have had even getting weed into the country.

They don't fuck around in the UAE and I'm guessing this young man had little to lose (presumably the son of an expat worker) nor enough respect for the law of the land.  A stupid mistake and one he'll potentially die for.  He doesn't sound like some sort of drug dealing mastermind to me nor do I think it likely his selling a bit of weed ruined any lives.

I honestly can't say which is my favorite, I started on Eccleston and grew with Tennant, and I actually love Smith as the Doctor.

With Eccleston, I felt he was so goofy but he had this serious side about him.  He was so good as the Doctor for one season.

With Tennant, I felt like he was really good with Rose's character, but there was no camera magic or chemistry with Martha Jones' character.

Sounds good? except that if you go down that route you run the risk of the water table dropping below the depth of your bore-hole during droughts, so no water comes out of the tap.

Grieving time? The Doctor did nothing but mope and emo for all of Donna's first episode and the next series.

Yeah, but I got over it. Doctor Who is all about change. Clinging to one Companion, one Doctor, and denying others is like trying to stop the sea.

&gt;Plus, she’s hot. Donna, not so much.

Now this is something I take great exception to. Why is Donna's worth as a character based on your perception on her *looks?* You are ignoring one of the great lessons of Doctor Who to not judge people by what they look like, and that is shameful.

Not only that, you are making a personal, superficial judgement on Catherine Tate as a person, which is abhorrent. So what if she isn't your idea of ""hot""? That in no way diminishes her or her character and you should not try and use it as evidence.

&gt;Are there any specific things I need to see that will give me that AH-HA moment?

true,BringElephantsNow,dorset,Dorset,"Well, the installing bit would be the easy bit. There are thousands of trained, capable people that spend their days installing &amp; commissioning new water mains.

The hard bit is justifying the capital expenditure, and in London specifically, getting permission from Transport for London and City of London to agree to Thames digging trenches to get the mains into the ground. Much of the mole- type technology is hampered by everything else in the ground. Gas, Electricity, Telephone (BT, Sky &amp; Virgin), Fibre Optic cables, communications for traffic lights, the Underground... I don't need to highlight just how much disruption it would cause.

Similarly, every company has an Economic Level of Leakage, agreed by OFWAT &amp; each company respectively. There will *never* be 0% leakage, in fact even the best companies (in the UK) are running ~10%. This sounds bad, but the cost (both economic and social) is judged to be less than the hours spent locating, pinpointing, digging and repairing the leak. Obviously if the leak is causing damage danger or distress, it will be jumped on ASAP (within a week of first report/discovery), but some leaks escape &amp; drain before ever breaking the surface. There are teams of Leakage Technicians and/or Inspectors, but we can't be everywhere at once.

Finally, if there was free reign of all the above, we would still be creating problems we can't currently combat reliably. The material of choice for distribution mains has become Polyethelene, either HPPE or MDPE. While each length is nearly perfect, when a joint leaks there is little chance of finding it unless it happens to be within 50m of a fitting (valve, hydrant, etc).

true,rule9,null,null,"Sorry for the ridiculously slow reply, just didn't feel like an involved discussion at the time.

In my view, most of the complexity comes from exceptions and special allowances being made, and then people abuse those exceptions by using them in ways that weren't intended to save tax. The scheme Jimmy Carr used is an example of this - it was taking advantage of a tax break designed to encourage funding of new artists in a way which put the tax advantage out of proportion to the amount ""invested"". Further complexity comes from steps taken to plug the loopholes, which sometimes themselves open further loopholes.

&gt; The other thing is that Cameron is going to be the first PM to introduce a general anti avoidance rule, which bans in a generalized way financial structures judged to be primarily constructed for dodging tax. So he is at least doing something about it.

I believe we already have a rule which says that if you create a new entity (company, trust, etc.) purely for the purpose of avoiding tax then you owe the amount that would be due if you hadn't. These rules *may* help a little, but it's difficult to enforce them as it comes down to matters of judgement and intent, and clever lawyers can set up a system with a plausible rationale (differences in ownership percentages, etc). Again, this kind of rule is easier to enforce against the ""small fry"", whereas larger entities with money for lawyers and legal battles can get away with more and even push HMRC to the point where tax owed becomes a negotiation (because HMRC needs to pay lawyers too, if they make a fight of it).

The main problem you might have with a simple tax system, so far as I can see, is off-shoring profits. But that's already a problem.

I've mentioned this before in other threads, but we *need* to begin bringing along some of our youth players. We have a lot of young quality, and it would be wise to let them see some action this year. Hazard, Ramires, Marin, Mata, Sturridge, Hulk (possibly) are all good enough to start. Other players like Romeu, McEachran, De Bruyne, Kakuta, PVA, (arguably Piazon) and Lukaku are all good enough to at least come off the bench.

When considering all of that, we don't need to bring in ""6 or 7 players"". We have a plethora of talent, both experienced and young. If RDM can find a good mix, and utilize the talent in both camps, we can save money (through not spending on more players) and continue the development of our talented youth. I'm not suggesting we go full out like Arsenal and start 9-10 players under the age of 23. But rather, appropriately utilizing our talented young players as depth, instead of just simply splashing more cash on bench/role players. Otherwise its useless to have spent all this money on young potential. ",0,1340755144,null,0,1340755350,0,c561age,t3_vmg9i,t1_c561age,t1_c55v87t,null,1429237845,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

You're assuming trench digging and disruption, what if that wasn't the only option?  people routinely bore holes with pinpoint accuracy without disturbing the other strata of the ground, we've got some hugely elaborate tunnel systems and tunnel system devices and a small amount of R&amp;D would quickly convert these to efficient use with small pipes in the london clay.  
  
secondly your argument saying there will always be (substantial) leakage is based on nothing other than the current out dated and poorly managed system, plus it's missing several important factors such as the damage, injury and loss of life or property which can occur when these things go wrong - it's far too an important issue to leave to luck and statistics.  
  
and what of the other aspects of miss management such as the over reliance on ground water wells? isn't it about time to start thinking more pragmatically about our water use and storage systems?  would it really be so hard to utilize the billions of litres of 'dirty' or 'grey' water we push into the sea every year?  
  
and of course yes, you can defend this from the companies perspective but as far as i'm concerned that's not the issue - the issue is our national priorities, or rather the priorities of our autocratic leaders; i'm sure if you asked the people if they wanted to drop bombs which cost more then they will ever earn in their entire lifetime on tents and caves in a desert they've barely heard of OR have clean, safe and plentiful drinking water -they'd choose the latter.

(Children's programme of Northern Ireland)  Two primary school classes from different schools(11 to 12 yr olds), one protestant, one catholic were sent to Minnesota for a summer. It was initially a trip to give kids a break from the troubles but by the time I went, we had experienced very little of the violence and it was really just an awesome holiday. It was in 2001 that I went, I'd guess the kids now feel even more detached from the troubles than we did. As someone has rightfully mentioned already, a greater factor than religion is a person's socioeconomic background and education. It is in the worse off areas where things are moving along more slowly. 

Honestly, they'll be normal kids, who like the same things you do. Some may be Christian, some may be atheist or just plain uninterested. One thing I encountered was that people found me very difficult to understand, particularly when my sister visited and we were talking to each other, so good luck with such a large group!

Something you may be able to/want to discuss are the recent Jubilee events and the differing attitudes of communities to the monarchy.

 I don't know anything about him being 'irrational and aggressively violent.' He's only aggressive and/or violent when he has a reason to be, like The Doctor screwing up the Time Streams when he's saving Amy.


 The Cloister bell has no relation to the Master, it goes off when the TARDIS is in distress or when a paradox is about to happen.

 He is shown an exit because the rooms in the hotel are based on faith. Rory had no faith. The only person I can imagine him having faith in is Amy, but because she puts all her faith in the Doctor, he abandons that faith in her. 

And about him 'not being shocked by the TARDIS'. He was, just not as much as anyone else, because Amy had told him about it, and he did research on other dimensions and space related things.


If conceiving a child inside the TARDIS wasn't a way a Time Lord could be made, would the Doctor have accepted the answer? Surely he would have kept trying to find out how it happened; that's not the kind of thing the Doctor would just leave alone if he found it strange.

He took a little while to get up to the pace of the PL, as many players coming in from foreign leagues do, but he's there now and he works as hard as anyone for the full 90 whenever he's given the chance.

And not getting any younger? While this is obviously literally true, the guy only turned 29 earlier this year. His game is about craft not pace and strength, so he's likely to remain in his prime for at least three or four more years.

Sigurdsson looked very good at Swansea, but I can't help but worry he's become a little overrated off the back of 18 matches of good form as the big fish in a small pond that was perfectly set up for him to flourish. Don't get me wrong, I consider him a very good player with bags of potential, but my point is that I'm not sure I see him stepping straight into our first team, and at not even yet 23 is he really going to develop the way he should while sitting on our bench most weeks for the next couple of years? He's just not likely to get enough of a regular run of games, which is hugely important at that age.

I'm also not entirely sure where you get the idea that Sigurdsson is in the same vein of player as VdV. He just isn't at all, he's a Gerrard, not a VdV - same part of the pitch, very different game. I'm not saying that's a bad thing or a reason we shouldn't sign him, it just is what is.",0,1340765537,null,0,1340767413,0,c563nmq,t3_vmsdd,t1_c563nmq,t1_c55wu40,null,1429238957,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

That would be in keeping with what we've heard so far: Ajax have consistently wanted a higher fee than Levy was prepared to offer, but Vertonghen's insistence on Tottenham above any other club prevented them from getting any kind of a bidding war going.  So now they're essentially telling Jan fine, we'll take Tottenham's offer, but only if we get to keep all of it - we're not going to accept less than we want *and* surrender 15% of it.  You want the move, you share the burden.

Something similar happened with Fabregas last season.  Fabregas agreed to a salary cut, or to waive his loyalty bonus, or something similar like that, in order that the difference could be added to the transfer fee Barcelona were willing to pay.  Arsenal couldn't hope for a bidding war - Fabregas wasn't interested in going anywhere else - but Barcelona wouldn't go any higher with their bid, so some of the burden fell to the player.

true,Anachronaia,null,null,"Actually, interestingly, in some places where the water companies have been privatised there absolutely are laws against collecting rainwater off your roof and using that instead of the mains.  The argument has been made that the water company is essentially 'entitled' to get paid by you because it has invested in infrastructure for the whole community, of which you are a part.  

The argument starts to wobble a bit in the face of counterarguments such as, ""well then, if you (rather than nature) have control of the rain, then why have you not made it rain *enough*? If there is a drought the community should be able to sue you for failure to live up to your service level agreement"".  Where they really fall down, though, is in places where severe drought is frequent, severe and prolonged and plain old common sense dictates that people should be actively encouraged to supplement the available piped water with rainwater tanks, which at the very least can at least be used on the garden, washing the car etc.

At some point I remember being completely gobsmacked that Sydney, Australia where I lived had such a proscription against rainwater tanks in place.  Thankfully they pulled their heads out of their collective arses and reversed themselves. A few years back I also heard complaints that farmers in Peru, who were used to collecting rainwater and neither asked for nor could afford to pay for a modern water system, were objecting to being similarly leaned on.

true,matwhitemariah,null,null,"1. Tevez- Even though he provided a fantastic boost for us at the end of the season his absence when we needed him mid season and in Europe is inexcusable. Sell Tevez and DO NOT let Guidetti out on loan again. He scored 20 goals in 23 games at Feynoord. He well be a wonderful replacement for the argentine.

2. Kolo Toure- As much of a nice guy Kolo is, he simply cannot compete anymore with our other central defenders. I think once Savic has a full season and pre season under his belt with the club he will adapt to the premier league. Don't forget he is still very young. 

3. Adam Johnson- His consistency just wasn't there and his natural winger position doesn't fit in with our style of football. We rely on our full backs for width. He is a fantastic player and I'm sure a club like Liverpool or Tottenham would pay top dollar for him. We do not need to seek to replace him as we have plenty of midfield creativity. The boy I would like to see replace Adam Johnson on the bench and eventually Nasri on the field is our young talent Denis Suarez. If I ask one thing from Mancini next season it is to give Suarez more first team action as he could be the next David Silva. 

As you can see we don't really need to spend money in order to get replacements for these players. City have a solid team, it is now just a matter of trimming the fat (kolo, Adam, tevez, Michael Johnson, Weiss, Santa Cruz, Ade, etc) and streamlining the squad. Also youth development is of utmost importance. (Please Roberto give play time to Denis Suarez).

And one last comment on those talking about selling Dzeko and Kolarov. Edin was a hero for us on the final day scoring that wonderful header to draw level against rangers. He has always been quiet and respectful towards the club even through long periods of being on the bench due to injury or a dip in form. He was our second highest scorer and is a central forward that provides much needed height. 

Kolarov was our European MVP. His defensive performances were shaky at times but he scored crucial goals in champions league and Europa league and has a wrecking ball of a left foot. Our only free kick specialist and our only back up for Clichy. Getting rid of him would be foolish in my opinion.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"To start off, formatting makes this a bit tricky to read. I'd recommend spacing the text out a bit, to make things easier on the eyes.

I don't have a good grasp on Sarah Jane's character, unfortunately, so I can't comment much on that. However, I do like the idea of one last resolution of her character, in light of Ms. Sladen's unfortunate passing. So bonus points on the concept.

I'm not getting a strong sense of which Doctor this is meeting Sarah Jane for the last time. This isn't a bad thing, because it leaves it very open for your readers to pick whichever Doctor they think would fit best here. Personally, I'm reading this as the 10th Doctor's farewell to Sarah Jane, as the dialogue seems best suited to his voice. However, I can see bits of 8, 9, and 11 in the voice as well. Point being that the blank slate is a nice touch.

If I were to offer a critique, it would be with how you write the Doctor, though. I don't get a strong enough sense of his character throughout this sketch, and I don't just mean which regeneration is living through this experience. I mean more that I don't get a sense of the Doctor's emotions or how he is personally affected by the encounter. He wasn't intending to go visit Sarah Jane, the TARDIS took him there - for all we know, he might not've even known she was dying. So to begin with, it's probably a bit of a shock to step out and see her lying there. Compare this scene with 11 receiving news of the Brigadier's death in ""The Wedding of River Song"" - it's a genuine blow for him to hear that such an old and valued friend has passed away without him even knowing.

So yes, how is the Doctor feeling upon arrival? And how is he throughout their final meeting? I get the sense that he's trying to be brave for her, or stoically cheerful at least (if that's not a horrible contradiction), but that's me reading between the lines for lack of a more explicit description. And at the end, we close out the scene without knowing how or if the Doctor mourns his companion's death. It gives a moment of privacy to the characters, but one of the most satisfying things about the Doctor is getting to see him at his most human, and the moments in which the actors playing the Doctor get a chance to really let the emotion through rather than the constant quirkiness are among the best of the show's nearly 50 years. Whether it's Susan's departure from the TARDIS, the death of the 5th, the anguish of the 9th, or the moments in which the 11th is convinced he will die, these occasions of personal grief define the Doctor strongly and shape our perception of him as a relatable character.

Finally, your physical descriptions are a bit lacking. This piece is very dialogue-heavy (and writing voices is its own challenge), but the physical actions of the characters are downplayed. Part of this might be related to my first point that the formatting of your story is a bit hard to read, though, so don't take my word on this one without a second opinion.

Like I said earlier, I really do enjoy the concept here. I'm very fond of the idea that the Doctor thinks of and is rather attached to his former companions, and I think it's altogether fitting for the show and the fans to mark the passing of the people who have contributed so much to the show.

Gylfi is a 22 year old exciting prospect who has a full season of EPL experience under his belt with more experience in lower divisions in England.

You've also got to find the old pipe (historic records are not always perfectly accurate), remove the old pipe (which may be in poor shape and not all in one piece), place the new pipe, make the connections, and check everything before it can be commissioned. If you hit any snags - maybe you accidentally damage nearby infrastructure or your new pipe doesn't quite fit - then you've got to have someone able to look at that problem and fix it. 

And as for using grey water, of course that would be better for everyone and would reduce surface water flooding and sewer flooding. However, again, it's just not simple. We have a combined sewer system that means all our grey water is mixed with sewage and therefore 'lost' to us. We could rebuild a separated sewer system to capture greywater - and some industry figures think we should do that - but building an entirely new double-sewer system would cost an extortionate amount. There are small-scale options - surface drainage systems that allow greywater to be retained in a tank and then used by local residents - but developers and councils shun these because they add cost, time and complications, and they generally don't understand the issue well enough to design them in a way that's feasible or amenable.

The natural history is spectacular, and I particularly like that dinosaur fossils have been placed next to modern animals as it allows comparisons of size very easily.  Also, for me, I love the dimness in some of the rooms, particularly the Asian culture room on the top floor. It's got a lot of atmosphere, particularly with the samurai armour sitting moodily in the centre.

What I miss is the vastness of the old museum.  Perhaps it is because I was smaller, but the old museum was so easy to get lost in, you could roam around and find hidden parts of the building, and it seemed more special.  I loved the old dinosaur display, and I loved the old carpeted stairs that used to be at the back.  It seems a lot of the museum has been limited for access now.  I also miss the banks upon banks on insects and other flaura and fauna that were beautifully pinned in large display cabinets.

That said, now I'm a father, the children's play discovery areas are fantastic, as is the cafe and restaurant.  Did your know the basement floor in underfloor heated?

I feel the new section that was built is too heavily devoted to Scotland.  Of course there should be a sizeable display for Scotland, but it seems the entire new building is devoted to it.  What about a larger section on the universe, or under the sea?

Dentists will also refer a patient when they do not have the required facilities on site, i.e. an oral surgeon, which is normally needed when it's a complicated extraction, as impacted wisdom teeth often are.

For that you need extremely large and complex drilling rigs (in the middle of London!?).  Also, these things can't just turn on a hairpin, you can only drill at slight angles, and given how sharply the piping network twists and turns it would just not be feasible.

Not to mention that drilling random holes in the near surface under somewhere like london is just a terrible, terrible idea.  All sorts of poorly-mapped cables, pipes, tunnels and lots of unexploded bombs.  The unexploded bombs being the real issue.  You still have to do a site survey whenever you're doing any significant work in the subsurface in london because there's still a load of old unexploded WW2 ordinance.

Also your CERN example is nice, but it wouldn't work.  Geneva is in the middle of a massive mountain range.  Most of it is nice, hard granite and basalt that you can drill holes in to your hearts content.  Most of London, by contrast, is built on clays, sands and gravels.  These have MUCH less structural integrity.  This is why the tube isn't being expanded.  We've basically built tunnels in all the areas in which is would be feasible (this is why there's no underground in south-east London).  Anywhere else and the tunnels would collapse all the time.

My posts just highlight 2 things:

1. Tor is a way of achieving anonymity on the internet.
2. There is a growing need for anonymity in situations where governments begin to take away the freedoms that are offered to its citizens.


I am **not** suggesting that people use it to torrent stuff, actively break the law, or undermine the usefulness of the Tor project (though I appreciate that the context of the article may have made my original post seem this way, hence my later clarification).

And while Tor currently couldn't support every internet user, isn't part of the aim of the project to encourage people to start using it, become relays and exit points, and grow the network to a point where it could be a commonplace tool?

Shooting people down who point out that it exists with a 'you're not oppressed enough to justify using it' undermines both the ability for Tor to grow to support a wider community, and makes a mockery of the promotion of wider internet freedoms.

Finally, it's completely unnecessary to make assumptions about who I am, what I do and why I might want (or need) to use Tor.  Surely that's the whole point of the project?",0,1340798012,null,0,false,0,c568kk3,t3_vob5q,t1_c568kk3,t1_c568fw4,null,1429241341,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Yes, because people hamming it up in front of cameras and edited footage for an entertainment show is an accurate portrayal of prison life.

Look what happens when you really focus on rehabilitation:

&gt; Within two years of their release, 20% of Norway's prisoners end up back in jail. In the U.K. and the U.S., the figure hovers between 50% and 60%.

Most prisoners come from pretty poor backgrounds, not just with regards to money.  But poor education, poor parenting, no role models, no inspiration, poor friends and attitudes.  

If you only punish them, all you do is release the same criminal, who's now just bitter / angry and who faces an even harder struggle to go straight when they're outside, because without any training / education / care, having a criminal record with no new skills is just *another* problem they have to deal with.

As hard of a pill as it is to swallow (especially the clucking Daily Mail readers etc), treating them with compassion, respect and like a human being works well.  Sometimes it's the first time in their life that people have taken the time to do so.  Even though they didn't show their victims the same respect (although not everyone in prison committed a crime with a victim).

Train them, educate them and show them there is another way of life.

Of course some people are just pricks and will never take the help offered.  ",0,1340802835,null,0,false,0,c5697eq,t3_voctv,t1_c5697eq,t1_c567nmx,null,1429241640,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It seems to me that the backout instructions were either unclear or untested and this is just an excuse.

I'm sorry but how dare you accuse people of having no respect? Good for you that you lived with your parents until you could move out; great. I did the same thing.

 But what a narrow view of the world you have thinkning that all situations are the same as yours.

My two younger brothers are both under 25, one works full time and the other has had to resort to temporary agency work as he has been unable to get a job because of the economic climate. Added to that that they both are on the autistic spectrum and you start to get an idea of how hard it is out there at the moment.

Oh and guess what?

They STILL live with my mum, but have to claim housing benefit because my mum's job (managing an advocacy charity for adults with learning disabilities) has had to make HUGE cutbacks because of government spending cuts. So instead of shutting down the ONLY service of its kind in the whole of north London, she took a paycut to keep it open.

Maybe before you judge other people so readily you should remember thatnot everyone's situation is the same, that most people are hard-working and want to pay their way but the situation in the Uk at the moment isn't exactly conducive to that.

Other posts have focused on the particular UK implementation, but I think it is important to also consider the practicality of any type of similar copyright measures.

Different restrictions can apply to different materials under copyright. Furthermore I would speculate that the vast majority of information is under copyright (this comment for instance, your comment, the op's), the only omissions being public domain work. The difficulty is in determining who owns what rights to what material, how permissive the usage licence is and whether the downloader has permission or whether the use falls under the category of fair use. This is far, far more complicated in practice than even the preceding sentence. It is a Herculean task simply because all information on the internet may be under copyright and there are far too many different copyright licences for any guidelines to work. So even if we remove morality from the argument, the measures proposed are still infeasible. 

Computer networks have made reduced the cost of copying and distributing intellectual property to a negligible amount above zero. Copyright law needs to adapt for this, but it is incredibly foolish to ignore the advantages that new technology like the Internet has provided and then to actively try to work against the technology.

I gotta say this software upgrade sounds shoddy as hell, its like they didnt really think this through, an inexperienced person doing the upgrade, a backout process that didnt work or wasnt fully tested.

My last role was working on a banking system, and we would have a coordinator directing events on a conference bridge, people would have to say what they are doing and tell everyone else the results before they took any further action. Everything was highly controlled, people would shadow each others sessions (they could see what the other person was doing on screen) and we would communicate with each other. Talking and taking the pressure off people doing the work is the most important part of one of these events. They will be tired and as you say someone may get a response they arent expecting so you need experts available or a phone call away that knows how to respond to an unexpected event.

Given that most changes are happening during the small hours, communication is the key, if the reason for this fuck up is the ""inexperienced operator"" then I would have to question this companys experience and ability to operate such a significant system.

It also happens to be illegal, but when no legal alternative is offered what do you expect us to do? Netflix is a very good service, but I don't care about streaming - I want to download an actual DRM-free file, so I can transfer to different devices and watch offline. The times when I want to watch movies and TV are often those times when I have no internet connection (on trains or planes). I also want to be able to keep those files, cherish them and watch it back years later - not be worried that it will disappear after a few weeks. I also don't want region locking, the internet is a global community and I spend more time talking to foreigners on reddit about movies than I do with real people. I can't be part of that discussion when Netflix UK has but a tiny fraction of the movies that Netflix US does. 

**All of these things are things that I will pay money for.** The appeal of piracy is not that it is free, the appeal is that it is the best user experience for viewing content on the internet.

It is basically the probation officer's job to know if he is working or not and to make suitable adjustments. If you have a probation case and dont know if they are working, you are not doing your job.

This bit from the linked probation blog is worth reading.

I can only contemplate as to the content of the Breach Report. What on earth was the Barrister doing to earn his or her money?

You're getting a bit ahead of yourself by saying Lukaku is the next Drogba, I haven't seen much of him but he didn't impress me when I did watch him play, and not many people are going to be as good as Drogba was. I'd easily put Sturridge and Torres ahead of him for Drogba's spot.

I rate Torres though, he has so much pace and strength that he will snap out of this malaise soon and start banging them in again. Can't believe he's not been starting for Spain so far in the Euro's.

You should be paying yourself dividends - yes i know you 'voluntarily' pay salary instead, but the tax system is specifically designed for you not to have to do this. Why? Because (a) you will pay more corporation tax (divs are paid after tax) so it is partially makes up the difference, (b) your business employs people which generates more tax that would otherwise potentially not been collected and (c) the money you save will make your business stronger and help it grow (which in time will generate more tax overall for the country). You are not doing anybody any favours by paying more PAYE than you need to. Switch to dividends, grow your business - this is the single greatest contribution you could make to the economy.

true,kingofbiscuits,uk,United Kingdom,"I do have an accountant and they do advise me on ways I can save against tax but I made these choices myself because I feel a debt to the country that allows me to follow my entrepreneurial dreams.

PAYE vs Dividend makes no difference to the business finances if they're going to be the same amount. The only person it costs is me personally from a taxation perspective. Also it makes it super easy to manage and do my self assessment.

What I mean by this is, suppose I pay myself £30k on PAYE for example, I personally pay around 25% tax probably. Which is more than the company would pay if that 30k was in the company for corporation tax purposes (20%).

Also while I appreciate your point about personal expenses potentially being illegal, lots of businesses directors write all sorts of things off, such as cars purchases/rentals. While they go through the business they're actually for personal use, it is borderline illegal but who can prove that the iPad wasn't for in company time?

Re: business growth, not to blow my own trumpet but in 2012 I've already doubled turnover wise what we did in 2011 so it is growing nicely. I'm not exactly worth a million yet but there's cash in the bank and the only debt is about £600 on a corp credit card that I can't be arsed to clear as it's still 0%

[Or this beauty where someone is trying to find how to buy a £15k car they don't need](http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=4037785) when they're going to have to move to a different part of the country, they're expecting a new baby and will lose one income...

Notice this part of the post: 

&gt;  Anyway, my question really is around how best to finance this. As I'm being forced with work to move to North Wales, my wife will be on maternity leave for 2 years, and so not earning for that time. After that she'll have some income again.

For me personally, I'm not a plastic millionaire. If I can't afford it, I don't buy it. Even if I can afford it, I usually think about it and then don't buy it. 

As a result I have thousands in the bank, put thousands in the ISA every year, spend around £2k a year or more on amateur radio gear, have a 2 year old car, wife has a sports car, we own two houses, kids get £25 a week pocket money each. On Saturday I blew a grand on a new Macbook Pro after spending £450 the previous week on a new washing machine. We have at least two holidays a year.

Our total household income is £32k which is probably the highest its ever been.

To give you an idea of just how extravagant a £32k income for a family of four is, a family of four with just one person working 40hrs earning £14k would have a total income of £23.5k with all the benefits they're entitled to.

So how do we manage this on such an average income? We have no debts at all other than a 3x income mortgage on a house we bought in October 2010. Mortgage aside, we've not had any other borrowing for well over a decade. It has meant running around in £500 cars for many years whilst others have just gone and signed their name on paper for a brand new one, some years not having holidays whilst others have just slapped them on their credit cards.

I've heard talk of Rodgers looking to build a 23-man squad eventually (1 team for league/semis and finals, 1 team for cups), and I don't think Bellamy would even get substantial minutes on the cup team. Would he be satisfied with his role as a 23rd man backup?

I would think he would be one to be happy to help when called upon, personally, regardless of how few minutes that equates to, but I wonder what kind of wages he would be asking for to take that kind of role.

Yeah, maybe. Easy way to endear yourself to a fanbase that's jealous of a close rival winning the Champions League, something their team has  never ever done.

He is the best player on the pitch by a mile. He is a forward. He has to be the guy to walk up, shelf his penalty, and get his team going.

If Pepe or Bruno Alves are feeling confident enough to take the penalties, fine (clearly Alves was not feeling confident at all). But it is absurd for a player of Ronaldo's quality to not take the shot.

Also, I don't think that he was going to go fifth because he was not confident. I think he wanted to go fifth because it would be the most pressured penalty (the first ""sudden death"" penalty) if everyone made theirs up to that point. Some managers buy into the whole ""save your takers for the toughest spot kick"" philosophy, but I think today is a good example of why it is a bad idea.

Edit: Pardon my comparison if you are not a basketball fan, but it reminds me a bit of Lebron James at the end of the game.

I suggested you have a very narrow view of the world, if that offends you then I apologise, but you haven't really given me any reason to believe otherwise.

Instead of saying I am bang out of order and calling me arrogant why don't you explain to me what it is about about my statements that offends you enough to ask for an apology? Or did you not expect anyone to challenge your views on the internet?

It's still pretty amazing that after the outpouring of emotions following the 2004 World Series that FSG have turned off most of the long-standing fans in less than a decade.

Like I said, I support the FSG group but it's an interesting study on the modern fan/owner relationship where the owners don't really have any historical ties to the club.  In Boston the strain is largely centered around their media control, heavy marketing to casual/fair weather fans, strained relationships with former players and managers and the excessive cost of going to a game.  There is also some strain because fans think they should be focused on the Sox instead of getting involved with LFC and NASCAR.

Could it be that the rift in Cardiff is actually product of the Daleks stealing the earth and bringing it into the same space as the time lock then placing it ""just a second out sync"" to hide it?

Or, even more likely, the product of the subwave signal breaking through the offset time to reach the Doctor? That would explain the location the rift.

You have to remember that the rift was there before/after 1869 (insert wibbly wobbly timey wimey...stuff), It was just opened wider by a servant girl named Gwyneth.

That lock has more holes in it than River could put in a Stetson hat!

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I can see Pritchard being converted to a deeper role at some point but I did base my opinions more on attributes than where I've seen them. Pritchard has a nose for goal and sort of a forward drive that I think suits a more advanced role. He also plays a killer final pass. A friend on another forum said he reminds him of Giovinco, which I tend to agree with. Lots of energy. 

I'm not pigeon-holing anyone; I'm simply stating that the players are significantly different at this point in their development and I'm surprised you don't agree with that. 

Personally I'd be surprised if Carroll doesn't continue to be developed as a deeper player. His greatest assets are by far his composure and willingness to receive the ball under pressure, IMO. He's one of those players who seems one step ahead of his opponents. 

So yeah, I agree that Pritchard could end up being deployed deeper, but I don't think Carroll has shown anything to make me believe he'd do better in a more advanced spot.  

As for Ceballos, it's tough to say. There isn't a lot of stuff out there to see, but he's very highly rated. From what little I've seen and heard his best attributes are control, dribbling, and link play. I know he's been used wide at times but I really see him as more of an Iniesta type of player. There's speculation that he's going to be around the first team very soon because of his recently improved contract...I think we might see him this pre-season.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I'm certainly not saying they're exactly the same - my original point was just that I think Pritchard looks a better prospect for an eventual deep-lying playmaker role than Carroll and I'll stand by that for now. The only thing I'd need to see from him to confirm that is the discipline to actually sit back and dictate from deep, but he seems like an intelligent enough player to have that within him.

Personally I think Carroll, though very good, is getting a little overrated by Spurs fans so far - I just think we're getting a little carried away for a player who obviously has a long way to go.

If he has a massive growth spurt maybe he can continue to be developed in such a deep role, but if he doesn't he's going to really struggle, and I think his career would maybe be better served if he were positioned not quite so in the thick of things, further up the pitch. And such bulking up really isn't guaranteed for a player who's already 20.

So I guess my point on Carroll is more that I don't think he'll ever the physique to be able to play a deeper role at PL level, and that's what makes me think he'd be better off in an advanced spot. But even then he maybe lacks the eye for goal he'd probably need if played further forward.

And I love the bit where she denies companionship but says ""But I do think you need someone. To stop you."" It's eerie. She's only known the Doctor for a few hours at most, and yet she sees that in him, something that maybe we didn't realize ourselves.

I also love how human she is. How imperfect. Rose was the innocent school girl who loved the Doctor and he loved her back. Martha was independent but still loved the Doctor.

Donna was pretty much a bitch the first time we met her. But you saw her grow and become independent. You saw her stand up to not only other people (the UNIT officer in ""The Sontaran Stratagem"" with the ""I'll have a salute."") but also the Doctor. She wasn't afraid of him, and she didn't see him as above her, which clearly the other companions did.

She grew on me. She had development, more than I think the other characters did. She changed over the course of the series. Hell, when she forgot the Doctor existed she still changed.

One of my biggest moments was in ""Turn Left."" She doesn't even remember the Doctor, but she just hears from so many people that she can help save the world. And she *actually* makes the ultimate sacrifice. The other companions always say they will or even are about to, but she actually ran in front of a truck and was **killed**. That stuck with me. She actually made the sacrifice.

Rose's story is done. Martha has some openness to it. I would love to have Donna back. She was loud, brash, compassionate, and real. I miss her.

And it was changed enough that she did not regenerate immediately. We saw a small amount of time lord energy released, then she woke up...still in the same body. Very similar to what happened in The Christmas Invasion when Tennant started.

This might have occurred because her body was so young that it behaved like a fresh regeneration. She could heal a bullet hole the same way the Doctor regrew his hand. She might even be able to regenerate. but who knows if that character will ever be seen again.

As to the hand, I dont think the Doctor could find it

1. There was a severed hand somewhere below the ship.
1. There was the same severed hand a little older in Saxon's possession, which he might have been able to use to locate the first once the Doctor had left Earth.
1. The Doctor regrew his. Meaning the were three identical hands at the same time in close proximity.

I would conclude that Saxon made sure a severed hand got to Torchwood so Jack would be there in the year 100 trillion with his vortex manipulator.

It's a loose end that unfortunately is probably going to end as such. I recently re-watched a few of the episodes, and it's led me to believe that the Face of Boe is NOT Jack Harkness. 

* In [The End of the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_World_(Doctor_Who)), the Face of Boe treats the Doctor as if he just met him. Even if he was just pretending not to remember the Doctor (for spoilers), the Face of Boe would have to be pretty good at playing obtuse to pull it off. 

* In [New Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Earth), the second time they meet, Face of Boe still shows no signs of knowing the Doctor beyond their one previous encounter.

* In Torchwood, Jack's death/rebirth is seen many times and in completely unbelievable situations. I truly don't think that Jack could die, even if he gave all of his energy to the city. He makes numerous references about how he's a ""fixed point in time"" and how he's essentially ""stuck"" how he is. This points to the fact that not only does he not die, but he doesn't age either. There are a few jokes, like Jack talking about gray hairs and what not, but I think they're meant to be facetious, not actually suggesting that he does age, just that Jack is narcissistic and still cares about those things after all the years. I think Jack not only doesn't age, but his appearance doesn't change (or at least ""re-sets"" every time he is reborn).

Added to this, there really is no reason to cull cattle that show a positive TB test, all the milk is pasteurized so the chance of cow-to-human transmission through meat or milk is negligible.

I am currently based in the UK and will probably be paying UK income tax for the rest of my life, despite never receiving a free education or healthcare from the UK. I'm sure there are many others like me..
