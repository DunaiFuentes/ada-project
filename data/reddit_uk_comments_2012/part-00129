http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE

It seems very lazy when you could put your characters in a situation where they must choose between their two lives or feel weary about traveling. Rory and Amy seem to like the simple life better but there isn't really a cause for this development in their characters. It's just something that randomly happens one day. Even the characters are shocked by how sudden and unexplained it is (""I committed to something?! Why did I do that?"").

I'm generally against the idea that we must dumb things down for kids. If they've watched this series for any amount of time, then they have seen plenty of death, dispair, and dark moments. But I don't even think making kids see things like this in this episode was necessary. If they had said that the bodies were slowly shutting down instead of the heart just stopping, then it wouldn't be a mystery that so many people survived. And instead of having Amy &amp; Rory sit around and ask questions on the ship, the could have had them save the people. (Edit: Or the aliens could have not kidnapped people in the first place. They had no reason to do that anyway.) The doctor could have divulged information through the conversation with the hologram or through soliloquy. That would have at least given the doctor more opportunity to have a more emotional reaction to a fairy tale coming to life.

These are very simple changes that could have been made to close some gaps in the plot. But the story, as it is written now, doesn't make much sense at these parts. Saying that the writers had to leave in (conveniently ignored) drastic consequences and plot holes because they needed to make the audience feel happy is almost like blaming the audience for what is just crappy writing. You can have a sensible plot and please kids at the same time.

I know the villain is a teaser, but I don't think it's a very good one. Sure, I like the *idea* of a figure from timelord lore battling the doctor in the future, but it just wasn't executed well. They didn't seem threatening at all (the Doctor can reverse one of their orders in a few seconds) and wanting to destroy humanity isn't an interesting motivation. It's essentially the motivation of alien invaders in almost all of science fiction. I see no reason to look forward to seeing them again.",0,1348370999,null,0,1348371257,0,c6c32hj,t3_10b4hz,t1_c6c32hj,t1_c6c2qvi,null,1429966777,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"Anybody else notice how lighting seems to be a common thing in the episodes this season?

I can't think of anything in the first episode (though that's not to say it wasn't there). In the second episode, we see the Ponds having trouble with their lighting, and trying to replace a bulb. Rory's dad says he thinks it's the fitting. So, the lighting problem is unexplained (or at least they aren't certain what the problem is, just trying to figure it out).

In the third episode, the Old West town has electrical lighting, which flickers from time to time. I can't remember if the power fluctuations are ever remarked upon, or not. But the first time they notice the street lamps is when one is going off/on. (though this could simply be because it's more interesting to have a shot of a blinking light than a light that's just on.)

In tonight's episode, when The Doctor is at UNIT HQ under the Tower of London, the power goes out, to which Stewart replies ""that's impossible, we have backup generators"". I'm not sure that we have reason to believe that the cubes actually caused the power to go out (since the cubes were just doing random things to be noticed). It's possible that the power going out was caused by something else, and the timing was coincidence.

Since the next episode involves Weeping Angels, you KNOW there will be plenty of flickering lights.

My current theory is that the girl/Dalek from the first episode of the season, who is revealed to be an expert hacker, is messing with the lights to try to get The Doctor's attention. How she's doing it through space/time is a mystery to me, but this is Doctor Who, so I'm sure it's not impossible.",0,1348371063,null,0,false,0,c6c32x4,t3_10bb0w,t1_c6c32x4,t3_10bb0w,null,1429966784,22,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,22

I'm gonna be honest, I didn't like it as much as I liked most of the rest of the series. To be fair, I don't think much of RTD at all. I feel he has ruined Torchwood with his Miracle Day bullshit (seriously, that series was such a fucking disappointment it's beyond belief) and I feel that it was excessive to shoehorn some reference to the LGBT community in EVERY FUCKING EPISODE of the revived Who series. I have nothing against the LGBT community really, but I don't think it was appropriate to have something in every episode. Why? **Because it started to feel forced.** It was like ""Blahdy blahdy blah by the way I'M GAY IN THE FUTURE ISN'T IT AWESOME HOW ACCEPTED THIS IS blahdy blah"". In several cases it wasn't even fucking relevant to what was going on onscreen.

I also feel he started trying to live vicariously through the character of Jack. He stopped being a cool pansexual future time agent dude and became an author avatar for what RTD wanted to be. I also not the first to accuse him of this and I won't be the last.

They did it with Donna too, where now she realizes that she is awesome and she's just as smart as the Doctor and she finally feels accepted and important, and he has to take it all away from her.

true,soccerholic1816,null,null,"My thoughts on the game:  
  
-I think Cahill and Luiz should be the first choice CBs, they both played a solid defensive game. Luiz still needs to learn when to fly into tackles, and he also needs to stop booting the ball up field. I'm guessing he gave the ball away more than any other player on our team just based on how many times he did that. Overall a pretty good performance from the entire back four, and there weren't any glaring mistakes, which is a nice change.  
  
-Ramires and Mikel, A++. Mikel played as well as he did against Juve without any big errors, although I'd like to see him give the ball away less when making forward passes. Ramires did a fantastic job of filling in the ball-winner/workhorse role in the middle that we've been missing. He should definitely get more time in the position.  
  
-Oscar, Mata, and Hazard looked absolutely fantastic playing around with each other. Unfortunately, it didn't work out as much, because Stoke played really well defensively (as an American, it was great to see Cameron play so well). Against a team that will be so strong in the center, it would be better to have Moses/Marin out on the wings, evidenced by how well Moses played when he came on.  
  
-Speaking of Moses: give him some more damn time on the field. I have a feeling that this season we're always going to be leaving out players who really should be starting, since we're so stacked in those attacking midfield positions.  
  
-And last but not least, Torres. I don't think he played badly, but he isn't really filling the role we need. What we need from our forward right now is the ability to take the ball in any position and make something happen with it. He is doing a really good job of working with the attacking midfielders, but as soon as he takes more than three touches, the play is over. Not to mention he is constantly moving himself out of position. Mata, Oscar, and Hazard can create all the chances in the world, we need someone who will take shots, open up for them, and put the ball in the back of the net. I think as soon as Sturridge is available, he needs to start, because Torres isn't doing it. And if Sturridge does succeed, RDM needs to continue to play him. That may backfire on Torres, but its a risk we have to take.",0,1348380117,null,0,false,0,c6c4qp3,t3_10atx5,t1_c6c4qp3,t3_10atx5,null,1429967694,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I don't mind it at all. I'm just saying, if one of Moffat's goals is to broaden viewership, he's going about it the wrong way. He can't just shoot an episode or two in America (or set in America) and do a media blitz here. He has to also consider the content of the show.

true,sgtpepper1990,mcgann,McGann,"1)  I was originally going to speculate that they both get sent back in time/killed by the angels, but I think it is only going to be Amy.  Amy dies, and Rory is left heartbroken and blames the Doctor for her death/disappearance.  The Doctor leaves him back in his time or behind, and leaves alone.  This would mean he lost both of them in totally different and tragic ways.

2)  In the preview, the Doctor mentions 'I think they are after you'.  Now we don't know who he is referring to, but it showed Amy and Rory as he said it, so it is a good guess that they are after them.  Perhaps in the previous episodes, the Doctor knows what is going to happen, and tries to go back and stop it from happening.  And perhaps his interruption of their timeline is what causes the Angels to come after them in the first place.  We see the lights flickering in almost every episode, perhaps the Angels have been chasing them through time and space somehow.  Basically, the Doctor causes them to die by trying to stop them from dying after he knew they were going to die...or something wibbly wobbly like that.

Of course these are our-there theories, but they are far better than the 'Rory is the Master' theories I keep finding on this subreddit all the time..",0,1348381107,null,0,false,0,c6c4w6k,t3_10bgb2,t1_c6c4w6k,t3_10bgb2,null,1429967764,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

As The Doctor creates some kind of deus ex machina of using The TARDIS' ""soul"" to always be looking at it from wherever the TARDIS is in time to keep it frozen (TARDIS in tact? Angel is subdued). The Doctor then uses the TARDIS to tow it back into place.

Meanwhile, Rory/Amy find each other at opposite ends of a corridor. They scream out for each other, start running as two Angels appear in front of Amy to stop her. She looks in-between them and screams for Rory to look out as another Angel comes up behind him, grabs his shoulder as he turns... and in a blink of Amy's eye, Rory is gone. The two Angels blocking her then vanish too.

Amy reunites with The Doctor on top of the building, Amy crying/The Doctor gloating of his victory. The Doctor says Rory will be fine, they'll go look for him as soon as they get some kind of sign from the past as to where he is. But nothing ever surfaces in present day, Amy becomes more desperate every hour they don't get word.

Finally, Brian tells Amy as Rory's father it's time they let go and move on. Compassionate father-daughter moment as they agree for a funeral.  After which Amy/The Doctor are walking back to the TARDIS to figure themselves out when the Angel appears before them promising Amy they'll take her to Rory. The Doctor tells her no but Amy runs towards it to The Doctor's shock. Within a heartbeat, Amy is gone. A flurry of anger/confusion/depression wash over The Doctor as he closes his eyes and opens them... and next to Rory's grave now appears Amy's with the dates of which they died, as an old married couple in 2012 (as their lives in episodes of Series 7 take place roughly in 2020). The Doctor sheds a tear looking at them resting side by side as he flashes back to the Silurian 2-parter knowing they were waving to the Doctor to tell him they're ok together.

The Angel then appears, asks The Doctor how it feels to know his companions lived their lives without him. The Doctor slowly raises his head, smiles and says ""thank you"" to the Angel's immense displeasure of wanting to torture The Doctor with their plot.

The answer is that you implement your wind generation and power grid over a wide geographic area (eg across the whole of Europe) as it will very likely be windy * somewhere* at any given time. Yes you lose a percentage distributing it over distance but it does rather blow that complaint out of the water.

Here's the thing though: that answer is so obvious, so old, and so easy to find with even ten minutes research that one has to wonder what the Telegraphs agenda is - or at least what Christopher Booker's is.

Ah there we go: he reckons school exams are currently *deliberately biased* so only climate change believers can pass them. I rather suspect Mr Booker is trying to export US style climate change denial to the UK. Hmm - no thanks.

The eating thing is a big deal, it kind of limits you to three square meals a day where you have to brush your teeth before putting your aligners in again.  Towards the end, i cheated and ate two meals before putting them in again.

Because of this constant brushing, my teeth were the whitest they have ever been.

I also had to have two wisdom teeth taken out as part of the process.  It only cost £100 though.

Battery tech or some other kind of energy storage with smart grids is the key, if we have that we can install as much wind/tidal as we want, store the excess energy and dispatch it as necessary as it's needed.

true,QwertyPoint,null,null,"Apart from gaining entry, I would advise you to look closely at your motivations for picking England.  You mention the lovely countryside.  Are there any other reasons why you chose England?  Was language a factor?  

What I'm getting at is expectations.  The reality of living in a place is often far from how we imagine it to be in our minds.  I have lived in a few countries and have come across many people who were utterly disappointed because their romanticised view of   a country was obliterated by the reality of living there.  

If you do pursue the idea of moving to England, I would stress the need to obtain as much information about the area to where you would like to move.  In my experience, the countryside is beautiful, but larger towns and cities can be a bit grim.  If you are used to city life, then you might want to consider closer to London.  A place like Bath is also an option. 

Feel free to send me a private message if you have questions about anything, but particularly about areas, towns and cities.

As for getting a job in the current market, yeah it is pretty crazy.  Have you tried doing training courses?  Short ones like a CLAIT or an RTITB forklift licence dont really mean much but show that you're willing to advance.  They can also be funded by jobseekers.

Have you tried working through an agency?  They tend to be off &amp; on and can be very demanding in terms of penalties but if your lucky (like I was) you'll get offered a permanent position somewhere.

Rest assured that the council and police are likely already doing everything they can to evict the 'squatters' - however the process takes a long time and by then they will have made their profit from the event and have the next event will be planned and someone will already be sleeping in a basement somewhere.

However, they're not exempt from local laws regarding nuisance noise - the guys I knew were always especially careful in regards to proximity of the venue to residential buildings.

  * But you can pass on the left if you’re in slow-moving traffic in a queue, and you’re moving faster than traffic on your right (also rule 163)

Nobody on a bicycle undertakes unless they're in a queue of traffic. So rule 163 applies.

Irrespective of what the law says, undertaking a long vehicle is extremely dangerous and I never do it. A car or a van? Absolutely if there's sufficient room.

What I can't get is this. They earn £30k yet can't afford to go away on holiday and can't plan past the next pay day. Our household income is pretty much the same. Household rental and prices are comparable. We own two houses - the second one bought 2 years ago, go on holiday every year abroad at least once and have plenty of money in the bank.

1 - Many reports around this story don't mention an important fact: The guy also threatened in a tweet to drown Daley ""in the pool"". I'm fairly sure that was the reason he got a warning or similar? Otherwise I can't see why the police would slap him, however I imagine they have to investigate (to some degree) when they get multiple (or even one?) complaint. Also:

&gt; A spokesman was unable to confirm whether the arrest was specifically over the tweets to Daley or subsequent Twitter conversations with other users.

Was it confirmed otherwise?

2 -

&gt; Comments on one of the pages praised Dale Cregan... and suggested more officers should be killed.

I assume there's a specific law against incitement/encouraging on the deaths of police/service people?

3 -

Is the story significant in UK because of the implied meaning? People take the effort to analyse swearing as a judgmental form and clearly some forms of judgement are wrong. Mitchell has the statement that the police lie in their report and use the word 'pleb'. Pleb could mean Scrut, Townie, Kappa-Slapper, Rude-Boi, Scum, Greb, or Scav. It is not a lie if its a synonym. For example the police could refer to the word 'high' as lengthy, tall or long.

What is the thing about swear words? One problem: You say it to somebody in one way and they can take it up as another. So if Mitchell said 'cunt' or 'dick' and the policeman interpret that as 'pleb' that is one thing, but if it was in the news papers that Mitchell think policemen are cunts that is another.",0,1348399621,null,0,false,0,c6c6oz3,t3_10c5i3,t1_c6c6oz3,t3_10c5i3,null,1429968647,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Well, as you progress through the series, you will learn more about an off screen event that happened between the classic and new series known as the Time War.  The Doctor fought in this War between the Time Lords and Daleks, and was personally involved in ending it by using a device/weapon know as the Moment, thereby creating a Time Lock, that removed it and its participants both from the universe and from time.  The Time Lord home world of Gallifrey is no longer accessible by time or space travel. The Doctor believes himself to have thereby killed all the other Time Lords. He says as much in ""The Doctor's Wife.""

Now, the question becomes a matter of, is the Doctor correct in his assumption that all other Time Lords are destroyed? We see that at least one was not beginning in the episode ""Utopia.""

We may also speculate that there may be other renegade Time Lords still out there somewhere. The Rani was an evil Time Lady scientist who was exiled from Gallifrey for her crimes. She would likely have sat out the Time War someplace safe, and therefore may still be encountered by the Doctor again someday.

It should always be about two things:

* safety, and
* courtesy

Evidently undertaking could be classed as dangerous to the cyclist as the potential for harm if something goes wrong is great.

But often people miss the courtesy aspect - and often forget why people are in cars in the first place - to get from A to B in a minimum of time (taking into consideration safety and other road users). If a car deliberately overtakes another and then drives slowly it will will antagonise the overtaken car.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Quite frankly I'd rather it just flash up saying ""actually mate that train is pretty full, why not hire a car or take a later one?"" on the ticket machine rather than just let you all pile onto some hideous moron cluster and spend a quarter of a day nuzzled in some guys armpit.

Without an entirely reservation-only train system you'd be relying on someone or something to somehow count occupancy. They don't do that at the moment, passenger usage figures are based on ticket sales rather than electronic or human counting. 

As for ""why not take a later one"" then you'd probably not have an advance ticket in that case, so how hard is it to look in the window and see if it is rammed before you get on?

&gt; Actually scrub that, what's so bad about only allowing booked seats? How does every other country in Europe manage not to suck at trains other than say, travelling right before Christmas? 

Not everyone wants to book in advance, there are occasions when people need to get on a train now and not wait hours or days to do it. This isn't something the aviation industry does terribly well.

If you made everyone book in advance it would deter the people who pay the highest fares - people who want to travel immediately. You'd also scare away people who would consider leaving the car in the drive and instead take the train for the same journey, and that is after all a major reason for running a public transport system.

&gt; Yes, if you're a commuter and pay £BATSHIT money for a season ticket you should just get a seat that's yours for the entire season.

I'm a commuter, I don't take the same train every day and base it on when I feel like arriving and when I arrive at the station. It would be madness for me to have to plan weeks in advance what trains I intend to get. The same is true in the evenings, I don't leave at the same time every day and may feel like staying later or leaving earlier.

Your suggestion would only make things worse, we'd have trains with swathes of seats unavailable for full fare paying passengers (commuters with season tickets effectively get a VERY substantial discount) because others have booked all the seats.

&gt; Get more trains. 

Are you aware of the rigmarole that the train companies have to do to? You cannot just buy a train that meets UK specs. The government steps in and decides what train will be bought and how many, who will make it and where it will be made. That's only if the government has decided you're allowed to have some new trains, of course.

For example the ""Intercity Express Programme"" - for political purposes it's being made in a key constituency for the Labour party, no surprise there that it was the Labour government who thought it all up.

Maybe if the train companies (and the banks that really own the trains) could just go and buy trains when they needed to we'd be better off. But they can't.

Even if the trains magically appeared (they do take a long time to commission and build), could the infrastructure take it? The signalling systems that are used and the way the signals are laid out only permit a certain number of trains to operate at once - major lines like the West Coast Main Line have much more capacity than a rural branch line.

&gt; The UK easily has some of the worst intercity trains of any I've been on in Europe in terms of cost per mile, quality and overcrowding.

This smacks of ""Europe always does everything better than us even when they don't"". We have different priorities for the way we run our railways - it's all about being able to travel when you want to almost every city, town and village shack in the country.

Edit: To open the debate up a bit, it strikes me that this is down the increased importance of technology and automation within the economy. Today, investment and allocation of capital are becoming increasingly important relative to the supply of labour. Although the same technology is also the reason why our economy has improved over that period of time.",0,1348405313,null,0,1348426293,0,c6c773z,t3_10c5uq,t1_c6c773z,t3_10c5uq,null,1429968884,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

1. The Doctor mercilessly killed the children of the Racnoss. The Doctor has on many occasions, wiped out entire battlefleets and contingents of enemies. The Doctor has killed, or allowed villains to be killed since the old show.
2. The whole plot of ATcM was easy to follow. A doctor from an alien world seeked refuge after being hunted by a person which he had performed an experimental procedure on. He eventually realised that he needed to make amends to what he did, and eventually killed himself.
3. I am pretty sure that a woman who kidnaps you, takes your child from you to be raised by her as a killing machine against your childhood hero, who has done all of these awful things to Amy ranks a bit higher than a dude who aimed a gun at her and only did it because he wanted to live.
4. The whole story of TPoT was easy to follow as well. The Doctor was there to help because cubes appeared, the Ponds struggle to cope with their feelings of adventure or life, whilst the Doctor struggles with the possibility that to keep his friends he may have to stay still for once. The villain was wanting to wipe out humanity before it began it's reaching into space, because the Shakri are self appointed pest removalists under the word from the Thali, which I assume is their religion or god.

true,meeb,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Most of the time I've attempted to board a packed train it is not possible to see the congestion of the train before passing automated barriers. Given there are electronic entry barriers at most major stations as well as electronic ticket issuing systems it would be relatively trivial to connect to two to inform you that your ticket purchase will likely result you standing in a toilet for several hours.

If you don't want to book in advance the above information should help. If you do book in advance you should get a seat. That's traditionally what ""booking"" meant, as in reserving. The number of trains I've been on that are packed and then there's three totally unused first class carriages who's tickets are 3-4 times the price is also irritating and a complete waste of money and energy. For the several hundred pounds a first class ticket costs you can fly ""business"" to most cities.

I think it would be relatively trivial to ""free up"" your seat if you're a season ticket customer and you're not on your chosen train at your chosen station. Virgin do it already with ""reserved from ... to ..."" and I would expect it to be the same on many other train services just extend it to season ticket holders. At most, this would result in a seat being ""wasted"" for about a minute or two after a train leaves a station.

I am actually highly aware of the procedure implemented in the UK for the government intervention in our public transport system, cheers though. Stop polarising my comment it was not about 'everything being better in Europe' it was about train services. The UK does a lot of things better than Europe. I appreciate the UK is densely populated and so on but our train services ARE terrible and EXTREMELY expensive. It's not just ""tough"" our intercity train services are bullshit and we should not have to put up with it. London overground? Awesome. Tube at off-peak times? Generally pretty awesome.

The problem with all of that is that Bale hasn't played full-back in almost 2 years. He hasn't been coached up on how to play along the back line, and even when he was a full-back, his defending was shaky at best. He's always been better going forward. Always.

3. Also, I don't know if he's trying to expand the show's fanbase, but I feel that he's not recognizing the fact that most of its fans are people who like weird nerdy British stuff. He's neglecting the vast majority of viewers.
4. Am I the only one who thinks the writing is getting less funny/tight?

I would argue though, that there is a subtle distinction between that incident and this one. The judge in the abortion case would (presumably) have held the crime to be equally heinous whatever the perpetrator's faith. Judges are supposed to vary sentences based on the particulars of a crime, if they felt there were extenuating circumstances or compounding factors. Hiding the remains might reasonably be held to be one of these. 

No discrimination occurs if the man who has the job of saying which crimes are worse says that one is worse. Discrimination occurs when someone says that the identity of the perpetrator makes the same crime worse that that done by another.

Essentially, I would argue that the sentiment ""I believe that Religious people are just better, and deserve lighter sentences"" is a discriminatory one, whilst ""I believe that a certain crime is particularly depraved, and so I will give out sentences, within the guidelines, that reflect that"" is not.

Frankly, unless it can be demonstrated that the judge was both unduly influenced by the charity (which has not, as far as I can tell, been proven, just insinuated without evidence), and overstepped his remit, his personal beliefs are irrelevant.

By contrast, let's look at Falcao. (I know I mentioned him before, but this is just an example) For 40 million euros he was sold to Atletico, and for that amount of money, they bought 36 goals. Another example, Berbatov, he has 2 good seasons with Tottenham, scores 27 goals and gets bought by United for 37m. 

The cost of a transfer reflects the quality of the player. Just like you won't see Messi or Rooney being sold for 30m, you wouldn't see Heskey being sold for 300m. It's simple economics, the more in-demand something is, the more you charge for it. The same goes for football. Which is why Liverpool sold him for 50m. You can't sell someone for that much without justification. And justification they had. 24 goals in 07, 14 in '08, 18 in '09. That's why we paid for him, for an assured 15 goals or more a season. 

15 goals per season is what we expected, and so far, we have 9. I'll continue to give him the benefit of the doubt until the year is closed. You wanna say he had an off year in 2010, coming to a new team and all, fine. You might say in 2011, he was living in the shadow of Drogba, that's fine as well. 

But its 2012 now and he's got the lead role to this play now. We've given him the support he needed, and people like you(and I don't mean that in a bad way) will always give him more than a fair shake. But we're 5 games into the season, with an additional 3 games outside of the EPL and he's still not converted but 3 out of many chances. 

I hope Torres can turn it around and we get El Nino back. But the more time that goes by the more I can't help but to think this project is too far gone to continue. Not only my patience, but the patience of others who used to support him is waning, real thin. I can't imagine Roman's is much better.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"Shocking refereeing decisions honestly. That's all there is to it. The game was refereed with double standards.

Shelvey either shouldn't have been sent off, or both of them should have. Evans actually went in with two feet studs up and Shelvey went in with one foot. It really didn't make sense at all, although he probably shouldn't have made that challenge in the first place. The penalty decisions spoke for themselves. Though, if Reina got two hands to it, I feel like he should have saved it.

I fear Agger may have broken his leg in the buildup to the penalty. I hope it's not that serious, but I believe he'll be out for a few months. I also think that Kelly completely tore his ACL in stoppage time. You could see his whole knee buckle which is never good.

I think what's more important to take from this game is that we outplayed United even with 10 men. We made the more dangerous runs and had the much more dangerous chances. We just can't seem to find that little bit of luck. Somewhere down the line, we'll need to find a way to get lucky. We've played quite well this season (besides for the Arsenal game), I think everyone can see that. We just have not been lucky at all. Whether it is refereeing decisions or post hits, we can't seem to buy that extra little bit of luck. The top teams get lucky all the time. While United probably gets it a bit more than anyone else, City, Arsenal, Spurs, and Chelsea just seem to have luck flowing all around them.

If we continue to play like this, results will come. The problem seems to be that we can't seem to bring this type of quality against the lesser teams, which will be a problems if we want to compete.

Last thing, no matter what happened on the pitch like that, Shelvey should not go after SAF like that. I understand he was upset and angry at the decision, but that was absolutely not necessary. I expect him to be disciplined by Rodgers in some fashion for that. He needs to set an example for the other players.

This season is starting to look a bit like the last: after every game we're talking about bad luck and bullshit from the referee. And it's true, we do get bullshit from referees. Suarez was booked last week and there was way more contact on him than Valencia. Van Persie gets the same generosity from the ref as Luiz did yesterday against Stoke. We're getting the shitty and of the stick almost every match.

But, as so many times last season, we made enough chances to have been a couple of goals clear before Shelvey was sent off. We made more than enough chances to beat United and the referee both. We need to start putting them away.

I'm optimistic that Rodgers and his staff can improve that aspect. I think they'll get Suarez to look up before playing his last ball. I think Borini will come good. I think Sterling is learning so fast and improving every game that he'll soon be a gal threat as well as an asset to approach play. Shelvey will learn from this: he'll learn to stay on his feet and concentrate on what he's good at (which as he showed midweek and at Blackpool includes scoring goals).

It might take the whole season, but I'm optimistic that we'll be at the point where these referees will have to be disallowing multiple goals per game to deny us our points.",0,1348411911,null,0,false,0,c6c84pq,t3_10cblt,t1_c6c84pq,t1_c6c7wzy,null,1429969326,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

Season 5 marks the start of the 11th Doctor, and are therefore a good place to start if you want to get into what the show is now.

true,aussie_gecko1892,null,null,"I think it is safe to say that Man U have expanded their business outwards from Howard Webb. 

The red card should have been if anything a red to Evans, for he was the one who actually went in studs up, and two footed, Shelvey went in hard, but went in side of the boot, 1 footed and won the ball. What more can you say. Valencia is a diving prick, and I will not be happy until FIFA start looking at these replays and booking the players post game. It is the only way this is going to stop it from happening.

Now, more serious stuff. MOTM for me........ tough to say really. Either Johnson or Allen, I can't decide. Johnson was the solid man down the line, kept getting those combinations in and just beat his man with ease. He created countless opportunities and defended solidly. He ""gave"" away a penalty (Diving bastard) but really you could possibly say he should have stayed on his feet.

Allen, solid all round, played the game simple, and most importantly, to the speed of the game. This is why I don't give it to Gerrard. Gerrard, whenever he got the ball, was slower than anyone else on the field, and he wouldn't play the simple ball at times. I mean sure his long balls can be fantastic, but all it needs is a simple on the ground ball to feet. Once he does that, I will start to like him again.

All in all, better performance than the previous weeks, which have been great. Real team effort, with a whole lot of heart. We may have gone 0-2-3 in five games, but the way we have played in each should have made it 3-1-1 (loss to West Brom, draw Arsenal). I say we have a bright future ahead of us. 

Hope that Agger and Kelly get back soon, that one for Agger looked particularly nasty.

Shelvey has a reputation for reckless tackles and a scary shaven head. Advantage Evans.  
He didn't need to make a desperate tackle on the edge of the United box. Advantage Evans.  
Evans rolled around looking like he was in pain afterwards, Shelvey didn't. Advantage Evans.

Before we've even got to the referee being mistaken or biased, we already have a situation where Shelvey's put himself in danger. As Jim Beglin said ""Shelvey's mistake was he gave Halsey an excuse"". If we've learned one thing from the past few seasons, it's that referees *love* giving things against Liverpool.

I think it has to do with Liverpool being a big team but not currently a powerful one. In the same way that journos love piling on everything Suarez ever does wrong (in truth or in their imagination) but don't dare criticise a United or Chelsea player the same way. Last night on MOTD we saw it pointed out that if a stoke player had done what Luiz did he'd have seen red: Shelvey was the refs' chance to say ""no we do too give things against the big teams"" whilst not, in actual fact, doing so. I hope that makes sense.

Back on point: not a particularly bad tackle by Shelvey; it was no worse than what Evans contributed and only looked bad *because* Evans went in with two feet off the ground. But a **terrible** mistake by Shelvey in going in for an unnecessary tackle that gave the referee an opportunity to make a mistake.

Still, Gerrard was probably worse at Shelvey's age. Jonjo will learn.",0,1348414790,null,0,false,0,c6c8n9n,t3_10caid,t1_c6c8n9n,t1_c6c7wbb,null,1429969567,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Precisely my point (which makes it funny you got upvotes and I was downvoted). It's one thing to have British actors and have scenes set in Britain... it's another thing to remind Americans that there is actually a language barrier of sorts (which happened when you heard Rory say pants). People feel closer to one another when they speak a common language, and the exclusively British words remind Americans that there is a divide. None of this matters, except that Moffat is reaching out, spending money trying to promote the show in America.

- We pressed well, United were struggling to string together 3 passes. 
- The youngsters are looking promising, I can't think of another club in the premier league with this much promise coming from their youth system
-Unfortunately we looked less dangerous when sterling came off, but it was needed because our midfield was getting overrun.
- Still can't believe it was a penalty, unlucky reina didn't save it.
- Looked an even match when we were down to 10 men. 
- We need to be more clinical infront of goal, we should of been up before shelvey was sent off
- The boys look like they are getting more comfortable with each other with every game
-Kelly looks like he could be done for the season, Hopefully Agger's injury isn't too bad.
- Joe Allen is phenomenal, always available, completing passes, and looked forward much more today

Mark VI suffers from a few of the same problems but it's still not overused too much. Then Series 5 hits and it's used for everything. It scans everything, makes a star whale vomit, activating soil, and a whole mess of other garbage.

Allen looking fantastic as usual, perhaps better than his previous displays. He was a lot more attacking-minded and always looked forward first for opportunities.

People keep saying this, but it's largely speculation.  Rumors that VdV wanted to leave for family reasons swirled around him the entire summer and he rubbished them.  I think it's far likelier that he was sold on deadline day because we believed Moutinho was incoming.  He was happy enough to move for the aforementioned family reasons, but I've never seen any concrete evidence that the move was undertaken at his initiative and I've seen at least one source (the Telegraph) explicitly state that nobody knows exactly whose idea the move was.  I think if we'd asked him to stay another season he'd have been happy enough to do so.

I was listening to a thing where this comedian was promised a role on his friend's sitcom that was being writing. The character was literally written for him and based on him, he'd been provisionally approved etc. 

This guy is a white bald stand up in his late 30s, that is what the character was written as. The BBC before filming started forced this writer to change this comedian's character to a black woman in her 20s to match a diversity thing. So these quotas lost this guy his job and made an unnatural change to the script for what will be, by necessity, a pretty different character.

Imagine for a second, you opened those links in a new tab, forgot about it and then later come back to it. You'd be puzzled even for a bit, why there was a picture of Wilf. The context is lost in the image, and whatever great discussions the actual thread may have... would also be lost.

I completely understand that it takes a lot of minutes for players to improve, and that they will never reach their potential without playing against top level competition. I still think that when we have players like Assaidi and Sahin on the bench, it is hurting us. Sahin oozes class, and while he may not have had the amazing debt that Allen has (very happy with him to say the least), we've got to remember that he has had so few games the past couple seasons that he is not going to be hitting his stride. BUT, i think he we started giving him minutes, he would develop and gel with the team much faster than Jonvo simply because right now, he really is a better player (debatable... but that's my opinion). Some may hate me for this, but I think that Sahin has a better chance of becoming the heart of our midfield than Jonjo does. Also, in Assiadi we have a quick, talented runner, and prefer to throw in Suso? Yes, I agree Suso has great things in his future. But is it worth gambling on a Suso vs. Assaidi sub in a game where we REALLY needed 3 points? I think in this case, Rodgers made the wrong call and threw away an opportunity to use a huge asset that we have. 

Anyway, look forward to hearing some opinions on this. 

Lastly, I am getting so damn tired of players falling at the slightest hint of contact. Man up, play some rugby, grow some balls.

I've been a subscriber here since the olden days when there were only about 1k members. I've always been impressed with the way you guys/gals moderate this subreddit. The way you've handled this subreddit's explosive growth over the last couple of years has been an inspiration to me in my role as a moderator at /r/asoiaf. I can't recall any instance where you mods have abused your power but, at the same time, you have consistently laid down the law when people get out of line. I've tried to do the same thing in my subreddit and would like to think that our polite debates are a direct result of moderator intervention when someone decides to become a total asshole.

Some idiots will call this censorship. They're wrong. No one is saying that they can't say whatever they want. We're just saying that there is a line and that if they wish to cross it that's fine but they can't do it here. Walk into a family restaurant and start screaming obscenities at the top of you lungs and see how long it takes to get kicked out. At the end of the day it's a private business and they reserve the right not to serve anyone who is a total asshat.

Same at /r/doctorwho. Same at /r/asoiaf. I've been called a dictator, a tyrant, a fascist, etc. for removing hateful speech in our subreddit but guess what? You can go to westeros.org if you want to be a jerk. Or you can go on 4chan if you want to be hateful and mean and bigoted. In these subreddits such language is not acceptable.

Keep on doing such a great job. It's really appreciated. ",0,1348421917,null,0,false,0,c6ca7id,t3_1018bc,t1_c6ca7id,t1_c69nl9i,null,1429970304,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Right, because I knew I was deviating somewhat from the original topic - but your point about Swiss healthcare was incorrect.

&gt;WHAT EXCESSES?

Most, if not all Swiss health insurance schemes come with an excess (reimbursement doesn't kick in under a minimum limit, this can be several thousand CHF) also, hospital bills are not reimbursed 100% - that means you can still be left with a hefty bill.

&gt; What experience other than zero do you have in this regard?

I've lived in Switzerland for over 3 years and had to use their health service regularly. 

I just wanted to point out that life in Switzerland wasn't all sunshine and daisies.


Also, calm the fuck down.

true,somegaijin42,flair8,,"-Agreed entirely on the first half. It was quite the frustrating 45 minutes.

-Things looked very strong on the counterattack, and I loved finally seeing Jan get forward like that and creating some chances.

-Defoe's looked fantastic all season, and 200's not far off. *Dempsey needs to get a bit more acclimated to us, but once that happens, I think I could see Defoe and Ade both playing up front, with Clint slipping into a high AM slot right behind the front line. * See edit below.

-We're going to have to start being more consistent in passing than we were today. Far too many just drifted into red hands, breaking momentum quite a few times.

-Friedel looks as good as ever. Hard to believe he's a decade older than me, and I'm not in a tenth as good of shape. Having two world-class keepers is a great problem to be having, although I hope Lloris can continue to be patient and professional about the situation.

-Bale was still solid at left back, like we remember from years past, although we missed his pace up front in the first half. In the second half, he seemed to drift all over the pitch, but still looked effective wherever he happened to be.

-Dembele was a FANTASTIC signing, and is an utter rock. Dude's tough, with plenty of finesse as well.

To me it is insensitive and a form of emotional abuse, but we live in a society where religious rights and freedoms are also protected.  They have strong beliefs about life and when it begins.  To them it is murder even if it isn't to others.  

One has to consider that the government would rather we are not have as much freedom as we do, in fact I bet it would be more convenient if we didn't even have the right to vote or question what they do.  So having the public call for more control is actually favourable for the government.  

People who call for such control are just useful idiots at the end of the day.  Look at any legislation that governments try to get past and you will see a constant and pervasive attack on freedoms.  When they line up with one's beliefs its ok, but what happens if the government changes?  What if we have a Muslim majority?  Would you want to be a minority in a country that upholds Shira law?  Then would you defend the majority or would you appose it?  We must support minority opinions because you never know when you will be in the minority.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"I thought AVB was brave to come out with the gameplan he had at the beginning of the day, and I'd actually seen the idea bandied about a fair bit on here and in conversations with other yids. But it clearly didn't work, with Dempsey drifting too far in and Bale not really getting up the pitch too much.

All credit to AVB for being willing to change the system at half, take of a player who'd looked ineffective (Gylfi) and put the system back to a more normal formation. I thought we looked much much better in that second half, and I can't wait until we're healthy because when we get back BAE, Naughton, Kaboul, and Ade, we're going to be a very, very dangerous side to everyone we play.

To put it simply; I was happy with the second half adjustments, I thought that he did a great job of managing the game. We did look tired towards the second half of the match, but that's to be expected considering most of the squad also played thursday. We're thin at the moment, so i'm interested to see what happens with the squad on wednesday, especially with such a huge match coming up against Man U.

But; on the season as a whole, I think that, with our current injury form, to be only 1 point adrift of Man City and Arsenal isn't too bad. We're really starting to play AVB's system, and at times looking unbeatable.

I'm fucking furious. One of, if not the, the worst performances from a ref I've ever seen. He ruined the game. Simple as. 

The decision to send of Jonjo was laughable, if I wasn't so enraged about it. A simple 50/50 challenge where he and Johnny Evans both went in a bit hard for the ball. It should have been either a red card each (which would have been harsh), a yellow card each, or nothing. You just can't have it so it's one rule for one player and another for another player when they both done the same thing. And after how lenient the ref was on the Evra challenge before it it just goes to show that this ref was bias. 

The penalty... FFS. Sure it was some sloppy defending to allow Valencia to get into the box, but that was never a penalty. Wellbeck conned a ref last week and Valencia has done the same this week. He was already going down before Glen got there, I don't think there was even minimum contact. 

Yet at the otheside there is contact on Suarez as he's brought down in the box. Sure he may have exaggerated a bit with the whipping his head back, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it was a foul and a penalty. 

Football, man. Fuckin' football. 

Now to something more positive; 

The lads played well, the new system is starting to come together nicely. Before the sending off we were all over United. And even afterwards we played well. 

Sterling continues to shine. And Suso was great, a game changer. Great to see these two young lads playing so well in such a big game. Hope to see more of them in the coming games. 

Glen Johnson on the left is really working and apart from allowing Valencia to get in Diving-range, he played well. With Kelly doing a great job on the right - whipped some great balls into the box that someone really should have put into the net. Hope his injury isn't too serious. 

Allen seems like he's been with us for years and was important in moving the ball around the pitch. 

Suarez... damn that boy frustrates me. Bags of talent but tries too much when he needs to just get the ball in the net.

Anyways, proud of the way the team played. Reckon had Shelvey stayed on we would have won. Hopefully Agger and Kelly aren't too badly hurt. ",0,1348425986,null,0,false,0,c6cb6vc,t3_10cblt,t1_c6cb6vc,t3_10cblt,null,1429970768,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"Liverpool will certainly finish top 10. I would be shocked if we finish higher than 6-7th, but you haven't been watching the games if you think that we're garbage.

The team is struggling to find cohesion and consistency, but this is the exact same squad that was unlucky to not come away with 6 points against United and City in their early season matches with a new manager and system. Liverpool also outclassed both with a 17 and 18 year old on the pitch. 

The future is bright. The first half of the season may be rough, but striker reinforcements will come in January and Liverpool will make a push. The defensive lapses that have cost the team greatly will likely fade as well; this exact same back line was among the very best in the league last season and I don't think that has suddenly changed. 

Top 5 is likely unrealistic but below 10th is highly unlikely. The future is bright: Sterling, Suso, Shelvey, Kelly, Henderson, Allen, Coates, and Borini are 22 or younger. Assaidi, Carroll, Lucas, Sahin (if he stays) and Suarez are all 25 or younger. These players are only going to get better as the season progresses and they learn the new system.

true,martodve,1972crest,,"Most of the hard games are over. Just look at it that way, like Mancini said - we don't have to deal with tough teams like Liverpool, Stoke and Arsenal in harder times.      
Silva needs some rest, I hope he'll miss next week's games (Villa for C1 Cup and Fulham away). Aguero (who now can swear at the ref, which I'm proud of) missed some great chances, he's a bit rusty, but he'll be fine in a week or two. Edin was great IMO, too bad he got subbed off for Carlos, I think subbing Sergio would've worked better. Mario couldn't make an impact on the game for so little time. Scott wasn't really as great as I thought he could be with us.    
With Nasri missing I think we could use the opportunity to have Yaya move forward from the very beginning of the game, which could work great.    
Javi and Jack are doing their job, even though there are some flaws, but I think we *need* Barry to start, he's just a rock of a defender, he brings balance between the defence and the midfield with a bit of attacking in his mind.    
Clichy was OK, bit out of form, but still managed to make some great runs. PabZab is clearly fighting for his place in the team, he landed all of his tackles perfectly, won a lot of balls and organised some attacks.    
Vinnie was good, I think he's coming back to his former self, he slipped once or twice, but still, that bicycle kick could've been fucking spectacular.     
I really can't rate Joleon. He made some great tackles, scored a goal, but also caused their goal with his clearance. I want to see some Nastasic in the league, maybe next week.    
Joe Hart is getting back on form. I think he's probably the most pissed off person in the team, mostly because of the lack of clean sheets. He made a spectacular save against Cazorla.   
Overall, I'm happy - we're one of the four undefeated teams after all.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"Before you build houses you need people to buy them. There is an awful lot of land about the country held by property developers right now which isn't being built on, simply because there are so few people who can afford to buy.

The real problem is finance; if you need an 80% or even 90% deposit to buy, you need maybe maybe £25k-£30k for a family home in many parts of the country. It takes quite some time to save that compared to where we were before the credit crunch; the average age of first time buyers right now is something like 37. But without first-time buyers coming onto the market there is little movement in the housing market.

The obvious solution is to let the market crash and reduce prices to help people onto the ladder, but this has wider implications. For starters, it could drive a lot of people into negative equity, effectively locking them into their properties because they can't afford to move (unless they trade down to something much cheaper - hard if you have a family to look after). The effect on the wider economy of lots of people loosing huge amounts of money (money they might be planning to retire on) are quite serious.

So like all bubbles, the only real way to deal with it is letting the air out slowly; let values stagnate (as they are) against inflation and try to find ways of helping out first-time buyers with finance.",0,1348429095,null,0,false,0,c6cbyi1,t3_10c7s9,t1_c6cbyi1,t1_c6caar3,null,1429971137,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

that's not to say you personally are doomed to be in that position in 20 years.  it's perfectly possible that when you're middle-aged you'll be terribly hip.  but if the normative psychology of aging applies to you, there's a very good chance you won't recognize much more than having seeing a few of those names in the news, and the odds are, you'll not have actually heard any of it unless you have to listen to the radio at your workplace.",0,1348429135,null,0,1348429410,0,c6cbyv0,t3_10cn59,t1_c6cbyv0,t1_c6cbe8a,null,1429971139,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Then I went to MTAC back in 2009. Made a new friend who was cosplaying as the 10th Doctor. She told me some about the show. 

A couple weeks after the convention, I looked it up on Netflix and decided to start with the revived series. First episode in, 9th utters the phrase ""Hello Rose Tyler. I'm the Doctor. Run.""  I've been a Whovian ever since. :D  

I've even gone back and watched older episodes. I like the 2nd Doctor most out of all the original series Doctors. I even do my own Doctor Who cosplay of the 2nd Doctor.

true,Shercock_Holmes,null,null,"There is a gold pocket watch in that scene.  It's never in focus but it doesn't appear to have any markings on it.  I do find it interesting that at 17:17 the camera pans right toward the cube as Amy enters the room from the back-left (thus passing over the watch which is located in the front of the shot).  The watch moves from center-bottom to left-bottom and eventually off screen as focus shifts to the cube.

The watch is on screen again at 17:22 in the left-bottom. It is literally in the DEAD center-bottom of the screen at 17:25.  This is a continuation of the same take so, of course it'd be there but its placement is ""right-smack-in-your-face"" and it is yelling ""NOTICE ME"".  You have to look past it to see Amy and the cube. The watch is still there in the reverse shot when Amy gets her hand pricked (17:29).  At 17:30 there is a close-up on the cube and the watch is in the background (top-right) and fairly large.  It is also completely visible/whole (unlike the vintage hairbrush also in that shot).  The reaction shot of Amy looking at the glowing/heartbeat cube has the watch in the same center/bottom position as before and this shot is not a continuation of a previous one meaning the position of the watch was deliberate.  

I guess what I'm trying to say is clearly the watch was placed there on purpose and it fills a pretty important bit of space in that shot.  Of course, it was probably chosen as either a red herring or, more likely, an object that looks good next to the other things on her dresser (mason jar of blue goo and vintage brush). The show kept continuity by keeping the watch in multiple shots.  

Now, now I'm not saying this is a ""ohmygosh fan theory is correct"" thing.  **I  don't subscribe the the ""Rory is the Master"" theory.**  But I do believe that the watch was placed deliberately in those scenes.  It was very prominent, was kept in shots that it didn't ""need"" to be (or at least it didn't need to be wholly in the shot or in such a prominent place) and isn't something you'd find on a woman's dresser.  A man's pocket watch?  Next to perfume, a mason gar of goo (possibly hair product - it looks like gel), and a hairbrush.  What one of these things doesn't belong?

Maybe it was a trick to see if the Doctor was still alive.  The Tali may have been sent out by The Order of the Silence knowing that if The Doctor were still alive, he'd intervene as always.  Since he did interfere with the plan, he's provided proof to The Order of the Silence that they failed in their mission of killing him.  Remember how he was ""laying low for a while""?  I'd think saving the human race (again) isn't too subtle.  Sure, the Daleks have forgotten about him, many others assume he's dead, but now, The Silence are aware that he's still alive and will be able to lure him to the Fields of Trenzalore where the First Question will be asked and answered and the Fall of the Eleventh will occur.

Likely they wanted something to occupy that space that still had significance but also wouldn't be implausible to find on a dresser.  ""Oh, won't it be nice to include this as a little throwback?  Fans who pick up on it will love it!""  Of course, it will just add fire to the ""Rory is the master"" theory which probably wasn't their intention.  (Or maybe it was?  Moffat likes to send the fans on wild goose chases.)  Either way, it probably isn't very significant at all.  

Deliberate? Yes, defiantly. Significant? Naw, unlikely.

Of course all this ""Rory is evil"" stuff has got me pondering. I think I would like a companion to turn out to be exceptionally evil (not necessarily Master-level).  Have a season or two traveling, everything is great and normal.  Build up that they're a great person (unlike Yana who only had an episode of development before the reveal or Adam who was not necessarily a ""bad guy"" - just a jerk)  All of a sudden, the companion starts acting a little odd for a few episodes.  The doctor acts out of compassion and tries to cheer them up and fix their problem.  Turns out, they're just fucking evil.  

It would really make the doctor consider his companions in a different light. The doctor has almost always been ""in charge"" of his companions or their savior.  The possibility that they could betray him and lead to his suffering (and not the other way around) is something I'd like to see explored in the new series.   

There isn't a background check for being a companion, he doesn't ask for a urine sample.

I do think it's a good idea for some new viewers to find an episode they feel some kind of excitement for - being fascinated by the Angels (a friend told me about Blink and the Weeping Angels), being a fan of Vincent Van Gogh already, maybe they like Shakespeare, interest in Pompeii etc etc. I think most people who like the show from those episodes will watch others anyway - forwards and backwards. That's not completely skipping anything - that's finding an episode to get you into it that you'll enjoy, and then exploring.

Nothing wrong with doing things in the wrong order and exploring if one feels like it, I would say. *-grin-* ;)

On Jack' goodbye: It is, of course, an alien bar.  And it wasn't just Ten's aliens, there was a Raxacoricapalifatorian/Slitheen there, among others.  And Alonso isn't actually human.  Voyage of the Damned took place in 2008.

On Donna's head beam: I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I think it's something that uses all of her mental energy to disarm anyone around her, and it knocks her out so she forgets what she was thinking about.  This is just my theory on it, though.

On the TARDIS: His regeneration was particularly volatile because he held it in for so long.  He also had no one in the TARDIS with him, so he let loose.  Similarly(kind of), the reason Tennant was so out so long in The Christmas Invasion is because Eccleston contained the regeneration, so it did a number on him, not the TARDIS and Rose.

Didn't care about his companion. But my - those enemies sounded interesting. Can't be that awful. And besides, as a first episode, I don't see why the 'main characters' matter.  They just want to see if they like a show - and that's a good episode.

I thought it gave quite good indication of what the rest of the show is like, personally. A new viewer isn't going to feel any particular love for the Doctor or any other 'main character'. They don't care about any of the characters - thats the point. You can throw them your favourite episode with your favourite Doctor and companion duo and it might not mean anything to them - they might find it utterly boring - because they have no favourites yet so they arn't viewing the show in the same way as you. They need to see the best of the show themselves before any love can grow for characters - and Blink is a damn good episode to show how interesting the foes/situations can be, at the very least, which will keep them with it to let that love grow if they like the show at all.

Some people, at least. New viewers don't have an inherent love for Rose or the 9th Doctor, or Amy or the 11th. That's a matter of opinion, which is why I think it's much better for *some* people as a first viewing to watch a particularly good stand-alone(ish) episode that catches their fancy - whether it be Blink (simply for being a good episode) or another.",0,1348438005,null,0,false,0,c6ce82f,t3_10cqth,t1_c6ce82f,t1_c6ce0tf,null,1429972264,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

How good is QPR? I didn't expect this at all. They are solid defensively even with two of their starting XI defenders out, as well as having to take Bosingwa out early. They were fast on the counter and, though they didn't have much in the way of possession, they made very good chances from the times they did have possession. They looked very threatening. 

Some may say 'it's just QPR!' but this QPR seems a hell of a lot better than last year's and for us to come back from a 0-1 position while being completely outplayed is a great testament to the players and the manager for not giving up.

N... no they're not. That's my whole point. Rose isn't here now. The 9th Doctor isn't here now (and the acting/personality/quirks DO change and therefore the dynamics between the main characters change dramatically). If you're gonna start somewhere on that logic, start at The Eleventh Hour so at least new viewers can catch up and keep going with Matt Smiths doctor.

Again, this is my point. Start people off on good standalone episodes so they can see if they like the show for what it is - inventive foes, interesting situations, clever twists. Not saying it's the best idea for everyone. I'm saying that I feel if I started watching at Series 1 or even Series 5 Ep 1, I might not *personally* be into the show now. I'm into it because I saw a couple of episodes that were really good and got attached to *that*, not the characters. Now I have my favourite Doctor and favourite companion after beginning to watch the show for different reasons.

 If you watch a standalone episode and like it no matter who the characters are, then great. Maybe you'll come to love the ever-changing Doctor and companions whilst also enjoying the show.

Last time we saw Jack, he beamed into space, now he's in a space bar, Alonso is from space, he's a hard working man that sometimes likes a drink, or maybe he's fallen on hard times and has joined the space village people.

Donna; the Doctor knew that if she remembered him then her brain would explode, he also reasoned that the most likely reason she would remember him is if she was confronted by somebody who was after him so while she was asleep he sneaked in and installed an artronic feedback loop in her brain that would caused the brain explody energy to explode outwards and not harm her. (except that doesn't work because Donna never met the Master, hmmmm. AHA! Wheel In Space, when the Second Doctor picked up Zoe as a companion he used a telepathic projection to show her past adventures and let her know what to expect (actually just an excuse for the BBC to repeat Evil Of The Daleks) so maybe he also did that with Donna, I know it's a stretch but it's the best I've got)

Martha, presumably it's a few years in the future, last time we saw her she had just got married to the bloke from the hospital. As for the sontarans, maybe he was after earth supply of rice pudding?

The thing about the tardis is that it's gone 700 years without a proper service (in fact it was being scrapped when it was stolen) Also, the tardis is powered by artron energy, or it generates it or uses it somehow, it's a bit vague. Also, this particular tardis is very leaky when it comes to artron energy, the Doctor has soaked up a lot of it in his time, it's also important in the regeneration process. So anyway, the Doctor takes a huge dose of radiation and starts regenerating but then he goes on a trip to see all his friends. Perhaps there's a clue there, maybe the fact that it was radiation and he's used to artron energy allowed him to contain it a bit, in Smith &amp; Jones he gets a large does of x-rays and manages to expel that without issue, the third Doctor got irradiated on metebelis 3 and he managed to make it home before regenerating (in the books it explains that he spent years trying to get back) Anyway, he holds the regeneration back and the artron energy builds up inside him. Then he lets it go, this huge buildup of artron energy explodes from him, feeds back into the tardis, maybe being reconfigured by the master caused more damage than we thought, maybe something else happened, maybe there was just too much radiation, whatever, the artron energy causes the tardis to also explode.

It would be so fascinating to see what it's like to live ,or try to live, a normal life with the Doctor popping in from time to time to take you on adventures.  I just felt like there was too much telling and not a lot of showing.  And the invasion felt like it was shoe-horned in.  I hope the Christmas special and the latter part of the season picks things up. ",0,1348442717,null,0,false,0,c6cff5z,t3_10cowg,t1_c6cff5z,t3_10cowg,null,1429972833,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

But, let's speculate a little here: let's say for discussion's sake that since the next episode is about the Weeping Angels, Amy or Rory or both of them get whisked back to a previous time by them, ok? That means that neither of them are really dead at all, but instead just living out their lives earlier, like what happened in Blink to Kathy Nightingale.

Still with me? Ok - here's where it gets all wibbly wobbly, so ""find something to hang onto"": if that's the case, even though they become ""fixed points"" (sound familiar?) in a previous time, there's nothing at all to prevent the Doctor from going back to visit them using the TARDIS (provided, of course, that he's not crossing his own timeline somehow - that's a no-no) - he just can't restore them to their rightful timeline, is all.

So, if that happens to be the way the episode goes, I fully expect to see them in future episode guest appearances just like we saw Jack Harkness from time to time during the Tennant era, so take heart and don't despair - ""there's always hope"", as the Doctor says! =)",0,1348443725,null,0,1348445083,0,c6cfo0w,t3_10by7g,t1_c6cfo0w,t1_c6cew05,null,1429972956,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,threep03k64,smith,Smith,"I respect your opinion but I disagree. I like Amy as a companion because I like her relationship with the Doctor, it's loving and close and shows a very human side to the Smith incarnation of the Doctor who otherwise tends to feel very alien. I love Smith as the Doctor *because* he is quite alien, but the human side is really quite touching. The actors / characters seem to click, and though Amy has occasionally pissed me off (with treatment of Rory) I still enjoy watching her interactions with the Doctor. I felt this very much so in *The Power of Three* when they were discussing Amy leaving. 

So no, i'm not excited for them to leave. I am however excited at the potential for change in the show because honestly, in my opinion change is what fuels the show and Doctor Who is the kind of show I wouldn't want  to stagnate. I didn't want Tennant to leave but in hindsight I'm glad he did because it brought in Smith, an incarnation of the Doctor I absolutely adore and it really freshened up the show. Now of course I don't want Smith to quit as the Doctor because he is just too much fun. So with Smith not leaving yet the way to shake up the show is with a new companion, and I really hope that happens.

I wasn't really a big fan of Donna (not a big fan of Tate to be honest), so Amy was a breath of fresh air to me. To me though, Smith does have that flair. My problem with Doctor Who recently hasn't so much been the actors as the story. Series 6 didn't feel right to me, I only truly enjoyed a handful of episodes with a fair few of them being awkward to watch. I'm enjoying this season more though ... but a new companion will shake things up.

true,Beezle,davison,Davison,"Rule 1: Moffat lies. Kind of.
 
They both live, most likely together because they are just too special of characters to Moffat, but something will happen between their time lines and the Doctors, creating a paradoxical, typical ""I can't cross my own timeline"", type of deal permanently separating them from the Doctor for the rest of their days, which will be their true punishment. That's my take. No one gets the chance to be with the Doctor without paying a price, and after finally realizing that what they want most is to have a life with the Doctor over a normal life, there is no greater price to pay than having that ripped away from them. And the most stressed themes of this season are 1. Remembering and 2. That Amy and Rory and not in-sync (timewise) with the Doctor.

Not entirely sure how that is tied into the Angels, but that's My Official Guess^tm.

Edit; If anything Moffat is probably being snarky like normal when he says one or both die, meaning from natural causes after a long and healthy life.

Edit 2: Aww man, reading up on the Angels, just remember they have the power to send people back in time! Amy + Rory get sent back, paradox happens while stopping the angels, they get separated from the Doctor forever, but get to live a full life together.

true,Quazifuji,null,null,"Moffat said the episodes were meant to feel like standalone blockbusters, so that's the disconnect.  I also think the current dynamic between Amy, Rory, and the Doctor (Doctor picks them up every once in a while instead of them travelling with him full time) is just a kind of interesting change of pace - I wouldn't want it for too long but don't mind it for 5 episodes - and it might be building up to whatever happens next episode.

As for an overall arc, I think this one's just a bit more RTD-style, with various motifs or bits of foreshadowing sprinkled throughout the episodes like in season 1-4, rather than a major arc like seasons 5 and 6.  There have been several things people have point out.  There's been flickering lights in every episode (and in an episode of Pond Life that took place during the season), there were references to Christmas in all of the first three (I didn't catch whether there was one or not this episode), the opening sequence has been changing slightly, and there have been several discussions of Amy's eventual fate (obviously foreshadowing her departure).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; But if that much grease and oil comes off your vehicle when you wash it, more is coming off it elsewhere when you aren't washing it and you should probably get that looked at.

Not necessarily. One of the major contaminants is brake dust, which is lost only in small quantities in transit, but removed in large quantities when a car is washed.

&gt; I am absolutely willing to stand corrected on this but I doubt people washing their cars in the street just became an environmental disaster overnight just when people started economising by washing their own cars and these small scale 'pop up' car washes appeared.

Their view is not so much that it has just now become a problem. It's always been a problem (to the point where it is prohibited in various places, including parts of Germany). 

It's just that now the petrol retailers association, given their vested interest, have sufficient motivation to highlight the problem and lobby for change.

As I said above, it's fair enough. There's a clear double standard. Petrol retailers have to incur significant costs to comply with all the regulations, while ordinary folk can do whatever they like.

&gt; And we're not talking about contamination of the water supply (which sounds alarming), although I'd like to hear from someone knowledgeable about the sewer system too, to hear if this is a problem for them, really.

That doesn't mean it's bad, just don't completely turn away if the first few episodes don't pull you in.

I'd still say try starting with ""Rose"" (season 1 episode 1 of the 2005 series) and seeing what that does for you.  If you like it, then just keep going through the series in order.

If that doesn't do it for you, you've got two main options.  The first is to just cherry pick some highly-regarded standalone episodes from later in the series and see if they convince you.  Blink is possibly the most standalone episode of the entire series and also widely considered one of the best, so definitely watch that one.  Some other great episodes that don't necessarily require context to follow (some have a bit of continuity, but I don't think it's too crucial to know the plot of characters of any of these to enjoy them) are ""Dalek"" and ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" from season 1, ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" from season 2, ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead"" from season 4, and ""The Eleventh Hour"" and ""Vincent and the Doctor"" from season 5.  

If you watch all of those and still aren't convinced, Doctor Who might not be the show for you.  If you watch all of those and love them but don't really want to go back to season 1, you can pretty safely continue on from ""The Eleventh Hour"" and watch the rest of seasons 5, 6, and 7 without having seen any of 1-4.

Muzzle loaders are now the only legal useable handguns available to UK shooters (apart from the historic cartridge firing handguns kept at designated sites).  From 1997, firearm and shotgun certification became more stringent. Among the extra hurdles, people who now apply for Firearms Certificates have to provide two referees, and the police are able to revoke a Firearms Certificate in cases where the holder no longer has a good reason to possess firearms or ammunition.

However since they got back in the EPL coverage was back up and I watched almost every game that was aired (which for us here that is anywhere between 12 am and 4am - not bad for a young boy who today didn't have iPhones or laptops in that time to keep me updated.

Saw it for the first time today. I was...disappointed. I loved McGann, but everything else...the writing, all the other actors, the plot...it was just so bad. The Master was cringe worthy. He seemed more like an early 90s villain of a Schwarzenegger film. 

Not to mention all the issues with continuity. The Eye of Harmony is on the Tardis now? When (and why, and how) did the Time Lords give their greatest power source to someone they mistrusted only slightly less than the Master? And why would a powerful Time Lord artifact only be able to be activated by a human? To Time Lords as a whole humans are just one of thousands of species out there. 

And the Master, who put him on trial? He is tried on Skaro, and he is executed by Daleks, but why would Daleks honor his request to have the Doctor transport his remains? Or even try him at all? After all, he is a Time Lord. The only explanation I can think of is that Time Lords tried him on Skaro (What?) and used Daleks as their executioners (What!?!). Unfortunately...that makes no sense whatsoever. They also just completely forgot about the fact that his body was decomposing after the scene where he flicks part of his finger at a nurse.

That's just the beginning of it too...I could keep ranting like this. I really felt like the 8th Doctor had so much potential, but we never get to see it on screen.",0,1348451322,null,0,false,0,c6chlgf,t3_10d485,t1_c6chlgf,t1_c6cffp3,null,1429973852,20,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,20

Yes, and that rant has been going on for ages. For fuck's sake, we got this bullshit with Rose and her mum. Remember ""The Girl in the Fireplace""?

He had the whole  ""the Doctor is worth the monsters"" thing. This new guy must have got it from him.

Yup, never been done before, except for all the many times that it has been done.

Rose did it. Martha did it. Donna? Actually, the tragedy there was that she was denied her preferred choice. Amy and Rory? Yep, they've spent the last two and a bit seasons ranting about how dangerous the Doctor is.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"I'll probably be downvoted for this, but oh well. 

I'm extremely disappointed by Shelvey after today's performance. Let me state that I actually agree with the red for Shelvey, but Evans absolutely deserved one as well. Back to my point though, we were absolutely dominating the game before his red. Instead of going in for a professional challenge on the 50/50 with Evans, he decides to do a type of scissor slide tackle, with one leg going above the ball for the tackle. If he goes in for a professional tackle or stays on his feet, Evans more than likely gets a red card and we're then 1 man up, already dominating possession. It was a stupid play, period.

My main problem with him today is what you, OP, seem to love, his attitude after being sent off. I thought he acted like a complete buffoon shouting in Rio's face and pointed and yelling at Fergie. For fuck's sake, handle yourself with some class after severely hampering your team, don't act like a little brat by throwing a tantrum. It just came off as selfish to me. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions and walking off the field with his head held high, he goes and blames Fergie for getting him sent off. Did Fergie cause you to make a horrendous challenge Jonjo? No. You did it yourself.

Regardless if Evans should have been sent off or not, Shelvey should have handled himself with a lot more class than that, period. There's a reason why he apologized afterwards and why Rodgers didn't have a problem with getting Shelvey the red(just Evans not receiving one as well), it's because he made a rash challenge and decided to act like a buffoon afterwards. 

He's such a talent though, at only 20 years old, **20 years old**! I mean think about it, a 20 year old has been one of our best performers this year and started against Man U at Anfield. Most of the time when you're that young though, one of the tradeoffs is inexperience, and it showed today unfortunatley. He's just too rash with a lot his tackles for me, but hopefully all of this will improve with time.

Ah, you missed all the episodes with Rory grizzling about the danger. Also, you missed the last season, where the Doctor went and picked them up again - after Amy had been abducted by some other group, and Rory again ranted that it was the Doctor who put them in danger by not letting the cracks eat them.

I'm not saying this episode is a re-run, but ""Rory and Amy talk about their lives, then decide to travel with the doctor again anyway"" has happened more than once.

Character development would mean something other than covering old territory again.

Or, perhaps the Silence in those episodes caused you to forget.

&gt; At any rate, this is somewhat immaterial-- whether you liked the character development or not, whether it's new or not, it's pretty obvious that the purpose of the episode wasn't the cubes or the disappointingly easy-to-defeat enemy, it was character development, 

Sure, the focus wasn't on the bad guys. But the character development was rather weak, at best. If the bad guy was weak and not the point, then the character development had to be strong. If both parts of the story a weak, then it's a poor episode.

The bad guy wasn't the point of the episode?

Personally, I actually want to really make sure I do see the episode right away just because I think it'll be more fun to say bye to the Ponds with the rest of the community.  I started watching the show relatively recently and finally caught up last summer, so I've always seen new companions or Doctors after most fans had already experienced them.  I did manage to avoid learning much about any companions before seeing them for the first time, so they've always felt new to me, but I'm still excited about actually being involved in the community mourning when the Ponds leave and excitement/apprehension/other discussion when the new companion shows up for the first time.",0,1348459689,null,0,false,0,c6cjqy9,t3_10bvpo,t1_c6cjqy9,t1_c6cid9d,null,1429974870,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"Joey Barton is universally hated because he is a scumbag. Footballers are people too, the majority of which are under educated and overpaid. Their personalities mold them into what kind of footballer they become and the style they play. The ""certain level of honor"" you are referring to is to just not be a piece of shit. What fans SHOULD expect of a footballer is that they give their all when they are on the pitch. 

I do agree that Shelveys tackle was rash but both players went in together for a 50/50. Shelvey is not the kind of player who will pull out of a tackle, that is just part of his game. Look at Gerrards early career, he had a number of horror tackles that were MUCH worse than what Shelvey did today and if anything Shelvey will learn from this experience. Hopefully Gerrard will have a chat with him. He is just a young passionate player willing to give his all for the club, he felt hard done by getting sent off in the manner that he did and he let his feelings be known. I'd much rather have a player show that kind of attitude than to not give a fuck. You absolutely need players like Shelvey, Gerrard, and Agger who are playing football for more than just a paycheck. They understand what it means to put a Liverpool kit on and it is that passion that drives the football club forward.

Bottom layer:
Chocolate sponge cake or brownie baked in a shallow dish, perhaps a mug or a cup. I wouldn't use that ready made cake stuff because it often pulls away from the surface too much and loose the shape (no one likes a disfigured dalek). Whatever recipe you decide to use, bake then scoop out the cake so that it's flat then invert the cup on a tray and let it sort of slide out.
http://www.easyspongecakerecipes.com/chocolatey-chocolate-sponge-cake-2/

Next you'll want to either bake a whole other vanilla sponge cake (doesn't require shaping in a cup so you could use pre-made cake mix) but that's a bit fickle so I would by a plain sponge ready made cake from the supermarket. Cute a cylinder, slightly wider than the width of the top of the chocolatey dalek bottom.
To stick it on top, they used a chocolate icing, some from scratch recipes here: http://howto.yellow.co.nz/food-drink/cooking-and-baking/chocolate-icing-recipe/ then just plonk that on top and cover the white sponge on the sides and center with the remaining icing (remember think proportions, unless you want to eat the massive amounts of left overs...).
I would put a lot on for texture but make sure its not to sweet because I think your head would probably explode. 

Now you need to use chocolate melts - melt enough to cover the base thing

For me that's pretty much how Shelvey acted though, there's simply no need for any of the petty bullshit he did afterwards.

&gt;Shelvey is not the kind of player who will pull out of a tackle, that is just part of his game.

I'm not expecting him to pull out of the tackle, just not to make a reckless challenge, where he leaves his feet with studs showing.

I agree with everything you said in the second paragraph, which is why I ended my last paragraph with ""but hopefully all of this will improve with time."" One thing I disagree with though, is where you stated you'd much rather have a player show that kind of attitude rather than not give a fuck. I don't want a player showing they care like that, for me there's a certain way to carry yourself after that type of incident and Shelvey didn't hold himself to that standard IMO.

All in all though, I was just stating how I'm disappointed in Shelvey for this game, alone. He's a great young player, who will definitely improve and become more mature in situations like that. I was just disagreeing with OP about loving the passion Shelvey showed in front of SAF.

Edit: can someone please tell why this comment is getting downvoted so much?

true,Quazifuji,null,null,"I don't think every goodbye needs to be tragic necessarily (Martha's wasn't), but I think the relationship with certain companions makes it hard to do it any other way.  Look at Rose, for example.  She was ready to spend the rest of her life with the Doctor.  She was ready to be permanently separated from her family to stay with the Doctor.  There wasn't really any way she would stop traveling without being forced to, and anything that forcibly stopped her from travelling with the Doctor was going to be tragic.

Similarly, I feel like the way Amy and Rory's story is going, it can't end in a way that isn't sad.  The Doctor can't give them up, and they can't give the Doctor up.  That's been made clear, and I wouldn't have wanted either of those things to happen.  Them just deciding to stay behind and lead a normal life for the rest of their lives with no more Doctor adventures, or the Doctor deciding to permanently abandon them and never giving in and coming back, would have honestly just not worked for me.  In order for something to permanently remove them from the picture (and I believe Karen and Arthur wanted it to be permanent, they didn't want to just become recurring characters), something sad has to happen.  It doesn't even necessarily have to be tragic - it could be the Doctor coming to them for one last trip when they're both 90 - but there's no way to end their story that wouldn't be sad, because, well, their story has to end, but the Doctor's can't.  That's just going to create a sad moment.

Also, just because not every departure needs to be tragic doesn't mean they *shouldn't* be tragic.  I think it's good to have a sad moment every once in a while.  It both makes the show deeper and more interesting and helps develop the Doctor's character.  None of his full-time companions have died yet in the new series.  Donna and Rose had tragic endings, but he has yet to have a full-time companion who left their adventures with him worse than they started.  Donna left pretty much exactly how she started (which was incredibly tragic because of how much she's developed, but the adventures still didn't really hurt her in the long run, they just didn't really help either), and Rose and Martha both developed a lot as people.  The danger that's there for everyone that travels with the Doctor has been a major theme of the series, but he hasn't had anything that would hit nearly as hard as a companion actually dying.  So personally, if Amy and/or Rory dies, I'll be very interested in seeing what that does to the Doctor, how he changes and copes with it.  Especially since these aren't just one-season companions, but Amy and Rory, the only full-time companions he's had over the last three hundred years. Besides Amy being his mother-in-law, he's had almost a fatherly sort of relationship with her.  I'm actually kind of excited to see what'll happen to him after her departure.

The fact that the new companion joins in the next episode after the departure is also interesting.  After what happened with Donna, he went through a ""I can't travel with anyone, it's too dangerous"" phase.  And he's already tried to leave Amy and Rory behind several times out of concern for their safety.  Assuming they don't have another giant gap where the Doctor travels around alone for 100 years that we don't see, there'll have to be some very interesting events and/or character development for him to pick up someone new so soon after something happens to the Ponds.

**TL;DR**: I don't think there's any way Amy and Rory could permanently leave the show that wouldn't be fairly tragic, or at least sad.  Anyway, I like the fact that the show has emotional depth and interesting character development on top of all the silly fun.  Tragedy leads to emotional depth and interesting character development.  I'm very interested in seeing how the Doctor reacts to something happening to Amy and Rory.",0,1348464230,null,0,false,0,c6ckp6a,t3_10bvpo,t1_c6ckp6a,t1_c6cjt6c,null,1429976474,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I guess my only general complaint is the focus of the show. I see Doctor Who as a primarily sci-fi series, but my girlfriend, and apparently a lot of people, watch it for the 'feels'. Now, I appreciate the character development, and the relationships between people, but I don't really care for when those things take the foreground in the community's eyes.

Torres is brilliant, undoubtedly. He is our lone target up front and therefore a defenders main concern. He rarely finds himself in a one-on-one situation, it always seems to be multiple defenders moving quickly to shut down his space. If there was another striker on the pitch, it free's Torres up, gives our midfield another target and helps split the defense. 


Torres needs space to work his magic and he will never get any when he is the target man. He needs a strike partner to bounce off and share the load. That's my 10 cents.",0,1348470947,null,0,false,0,c6clows,t3_10daqg,t1_c6clows,t3_10daqg,null,1429977406,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

There's room for 5 more doctors after the eleventh, if she gave all her remaining regenerations away..


But, I think she had to give them ALL up at once to let him stay alive without regenerating(which if you count the energy she gave him as a regeneration that takes that 5 more possible doctors and makes it 4 more.)

true,moxiedrinker82,null,null,"&gt; Anybody else out there still just enjoy the show?

There are some who will come out of the woodwork and complain, sure, but someone commenting that they're not enjoying the show is a valid opinion. This is a public community, there are going to be people here that don't agree with everyone or anyone. I know people who refuse to watch the 2005 series because they grew up on the original stuff. To each their own, I say.

That being said, when you discover something, develop and interest in it and eventually a deep appreciation for it...then you see the quality of it begin to diminish, people will comment. I also watch Breaking Bad (which is one continuous story, episode to episode). The criticism about specific episodes annoys me there because people are analyzing one part of a greater whole. While past series of Doctor Who have had over-arching plots, each episode has been pretty much single-serving (or two-part). It's easier to compare and contrast them but it's not always a level playing field. Focusing solely on the current series, I think it's going really well. The episodes are less about ""Let's see what happens to Amy, Rory and The Doctor this week!"" and have been more thematic. Doctor Who does Westerns (""A Town Called Mercy""). Doctor Who does mundane ""normal"" life (""The Power of Three""). I like this approach, it feels fresh and genuine instead of ""Let's push things as far as we can into ridiculousness and hope people still buy it!"" (which is what has been happening over the past two series, progressively)

Some of these are valid criticisms, some are just opinions. This site is for sharing ideas and holding discussions. When I've said I didn't enjoy something, plenty of people have told me that I'm wrong and ""Well, you can just leave"" in the past.

Another kicker I think this is more believable is that in 6x02, Day of the Moon episode, towards the end you see the little girl in pain and regenerates in front of a homeless man. We all figured this is River since in 6x08, Let's Kill Hitler episode, she quotes ""The last time I did this I ended up a toddler — in the middle of New York."" Here's a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwQTBTAKiyg) of the scene in which she wasn't lying at all, Manhattan tower in the back scene. 

I think, somehow in 7x05, Amy and Rory are sent back to this time or around the time after the regeneration. Possibly recognize River as the 'Mel' they grew up with from childhood. Figuring time is wibbly wobbly, and they can't change their past, they probably traveled back to England so that 'Mel' can still grow up with young Amelia Pond and Rory Williams while the older Ponds get the chance of raising their kid as they had always wanted. 

Then maybe somewhere along the way Mel gets kidnapped again to be trained professionally to kill the Doctor and then we're lead straight back into episode, Let's Kill Hitler. Or something like that. Ta-da! 

Edit: Since I'm getting some time mix up! Day of the Moon is dated July 20, 1969. 6 months later, January 20, 1970 is when Mel's regenerated! I can only hope that around this time is when Amy and Rory find her and maybe the Doctor finds them after they found their child. Possible, he thinks, he needs to set time in motion. Keep Mel's together with young Amy and Rory otherwise his past, present, and future wouldn't make sense. Maybe he even help get current Amy and Rory with young toddler Mel's back to England so she can grow up properly. Who knows. All of this is a wibbly wobbly mess.

I've seen a couple of replays and most likely is a MCL strain, potentially with a tear to the ACL and mensicus. Depending on how bad tears are, that's a shocking injury that can be a long long term injury. I'm desperately hopeful I'm wrong though. 

As for Kelly, his looked less conspicuous but his too looked like it could've been an injury to his ACL/PCL. Hopefully it's not too bad though.

I really want Coates to come into the first team (there's really no competition except carra and thus far rodgers has preferred coates). Enrque will almost certainly be given a chance back at left back, and I think a run in the first team might build his confidence back up, especially since the next three are all winnable fixtures. 

The biggest ""opportunity"" from these injuries though, is to (hopefully) see Robinson get some game time again, at least in the europa squad.

At worst, the government took out a short-term loan from other banks and investors to lend to the failing banks, and has been largely repaid by the creditors.

""we"" as in the taxpayer didn't contribute to that bailout fund. In fact, although not proven, there is some suspicions that the government may have made a profit on the deal.

There was a theoretical risk that the guarantees, which existed already and were simply expanded could have become actual liabilities, but that never happened, and as such as soon as the guarantees are cancelled, the accounting in the government liabilities is adjusted downwards.

&gt; Article 227-27 prohibits sexual relations with minors over age 15 (aged 15, 16 or 17) "" 1° where they are committed by a legitimate, natural or adoptive ascendant or by any other person having authority over the victim; 2° where they are committed by a person abusing the authority conferred by his functions.""

I would say that a teacher goes under the banner of authority, e.g. *loco parentis*. Similar laws seem to apply in Spain, Germany and Italy where the age of consent is also less than 16.

So (providing he is actually guilty of the deed - innocent until found guilty etc etc) if you were wondering if this was some grand scheme to go to France make it so he wasn't a technically paedophile... he'd still be considered a paedophile.

true,The_Bravinator,lancashire,Lancashire,"What.

Ironing has plenty to do with feminism. What the fuck has feminism historically been about if not (aside from voting rights) giving women the ability to get out of the home and into the workplace? Breaking down traditional gender roles that assume women are going to just *love* ironing is something feminists are very much concerned with. We care about avoiding having women be the default cooks and cleaners at home (something that still exists--even in relationships where both partners work, it is more common for women to take on the lion's share of household chores and childcare). It's just fine if a woman WANTS to make that choice for herself, but it should be equally fine for her to make a different choice, or for a man to make that choice for himself.

I don't get angry about a woman talking about homemaking. I adore baking, sewing, embroidery, and a whole range of ""stereotypically feminine"" pursuits. I get annoyed about being pigeonholed for being a woman. 

There is a conflict between my feminist beliefs and the enjoyment I find in these hobbies. That was the joke. It's not an internal conflict--I'm quite comfortable with it in my mind, because I know that feminism is, to me, about women (and men, just as much) having the CHOICE to be who they want to be, whether that is traditionally feminine, traditionally masculine, homemaker, child-rearer, career person or whatever else. I want to live in a world where people can be anything they want to be without being stereotyped or having assumptions made about them because of their gender. Without having a backlash for not living up to gender ideals. I want to live in a world where it's NORMAL for a woman to be the breadwinner and a man to be a stay-at-home dad, if they so choose, just as it's acceptable for them to choose the opposite. Is that a bad ideal to have?

The conflict is on the outside--between my hobbies and what many people EXPECT from feminism (a rejection of traditional femininity).

true,bairy,uk,Birmingham,"This will not backfire on the Mail. **Nothing** backfires on the Mail. There is simply no such thing as bad publicity for them.

Here's the business model:

Hate and critisise pretty much everything on a daily basis using carefully crafted emotional stories. People are drawn into thinking these stories are true, and continue to read the Mail in order to back up their belief that these stories are true. These people dismiss all sources that say these stories aren't true because people don't like to think they are wrong about something, especially if they've spent a lot of money and time on reading that something. That's the regulars sorted.

Now add in some celebrity gossip and buy the best photos in the world. That's celeb fans and anyone who surfs /r/earthporn attracted. Try to get those people to become invested regulars (people who buy every day) using point above.

Every so often make a piece that's so shit, so utterly hateful (such as that the death of prostitutes is ""no great loss"" or that a gay man didn't die from a heart condition like the coroner said, but he died cos he was gay), that it attracts thousands of critisisms across facebook, reddit, twitter etc., thus bringing people in by the tens of thousands so they can read how bad it is. Try to keep those people by using the two points above.

Also use the traffic as a way of getting more ad revenue, and saying ""Hey look at our millions of visitors, We're website of the year!"" - yes this actually happened.

And this all works exceedingly well. Now you might say ""but if they have printed shit then people will refuse to read them again"". In principal yes, in reality no. Immigrants, gay people, women, they all willingly pay for and read the Mail despite the Mail's obvious hatred of them. Psychology is a strange thing.

Edit: I rather went off on one there. To answer the post I replied to more specifically: Occasionally Mail stories get serious critisism in the comments, about how the Mail stole this or did that or how the story is shit or whatever. But in the end people don't care about that stuff unless it affects them directly such as they had their own photo stolen. The regulars want their emotionally charged daily fix of reassurance in the negative stuff that they already believe, and the knowledge of the Mail stealing someone elses photo isn't going to stop that.",0,1348491556,null,0,1348495638,0,c6cnk9m,t3_10dzsx,t1_c6cnk9m,t1_c6cnaq3,null,1429978038,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

true,woxy_lutz,eng-berkshire,in the land of the rock music,"&gt; This type of example is quite common. As soon as a drug is coming off patent the companies will add an extra carbon atom to the drug give it a new name and sell it for much more. Eg clopidogrel and prasugrel. Omeprazole and esomeprazole. Citalopram and escitalopram.

This is not how the pharmaceutical industry works. Changing a single atom, or even the configuration of the molecule (i.e. in which direction certain bonds point) as in your latter two examples, can have a huge effect on how drugs bind to receptors, their efficacy and side-effects (think of the two enantiomers of thalidomide, for example). For this reason, *any* change you make to the molecule means it has to go through clinical trials and approval process all over again, which is very expensive and with no guarantee of success.

Pharmaceutical companies don't make analogs of successful drugs to avoid patent expirations, because they have to patent every molecule (even with only one atom different) separately. You may notice that a lot of these analogs are developed by different companies than the original, in fact. Analogs are made to try to improve efficacy or reduce side-effects. The only way companies can extend patents on their molecules is to prove that it is effective to treat an entirely new medical condition (e.g. an antidepressant being used to treat headaches).

The Daleks were modeled after the Nazis by Terry Nation, especially their supreme-race, holier-than-thou attitude. In Genesis of the Daleks this allusion is made more explicit by the uniforms and military structure of the Kaleds, and after generations of war between two distinct races its logical that an element of racism (or speciesism?) would evolve, especially considering, at the time, Skaro knew of no alien civilizations.

The rest of their characteristics are born of Davros'; he experimented with mutants created by the fallout of the nuclear winter created as a result of the war, accelerated their mutations until they became Daleks.

Instead of ranting on like a loon engage your brain. Three are a 3G network. There are very very few areas left where they have 2G coverage because they ended their roaming deal due to the increase in coverage of their network so you can't use a 2G phone because there is no 2G service to connect to in most of the country so what you got told was right. If there is a 2G service you can connect to you must live in the arse end of nowhere.

The 11th Doctor either wears a red or blue tie. In some lighting it may appear gray, but I'm pretty sure it's always red or blue.

I just spent a bit of time looking through screen caps from this series. Here's what I found:

Asylum of the Daleks - Blue  
Dinosaurs on a Spaceship - Red  
A Town Called Mercy - Blue  
The Power of Three - At beginning of invasion, blue. Rest of the episode (including talking to Amy out by the water and their 7 week adventure), red.  
[Angels Take Manhattan - ](#s ""Red (all promos seem to show a red tie)"")

true,scribacious,null,null,"Here are my jumbled thoughts so far:  

1.  When was the last time I remember seeing a cube in the show before this episode?  When the doctor received ""mail"" from another Time Lord (not really) in the Doctor's Wife episode.  I take the cube as one of the symbols of a Time Lord.

2.  The Power of 3 was rushed and a little unsatisfactory of an episode, but it also makes me think it was a clean up job done by the Doctor.  It was a clean up job, or the effect of something being caused elsewhere/the future.  In season 5, nearly everything they encountered was the result of the Tardis's initial explosion that caused the cracks.  What I'm talking about is, for example, the Vampires of Venice saying that they were on Earth because their world disappeared, and that disappearance was caused by the breaking down of time and space because the Tardis exploded.  I don't remember there being any resolution as to why the Tardis exploded the first time because the following season concentrated on saving the Doctor's life instead.  Please correct my assumptions if they are wrong.  I just can't shake the feeling that the Doctor, himself, (or even with future River) made the Pandorica...*a cube*.  

3. ""Whoever takes the Pandorica takes the universe.  But bad news everyone, because Guess Who?""  That was very grandiose for not knowing the purpose of the Pandorica.  Didn't he behave as if he knew of the legend of the Pandorica?  River behaved as if she knew as well when they talked about it in the previous Weeping Angels episode.  They just said it was a legend.  I wonder exactly what that legend was that they already knew about before encountering it.  I understand that it was a future River that mentioned it first, but the Doctor responded strongly to it.

4.  Does anyone have a transcript of the conversation that the Doctor had with the holographic Shakri?  I think that the conversation should be analyzed carefully.  This is because without that analysis, so far, I'm thinking that the solution was too easy because the Doctor from the future may have sent it to Earth for his earlier self to clean up to keep a continuity of his own timeline.  Some evidence?  I think the Doctor was just a little too disappointed at the cubes containing nothing inside them.  The one that played the chicken dance on repeated loop sounds to me like a prank the Doctor would play to replace something sinister that was once there.

5. Parallel Universes- A. The first universe that the Doctor had with Amy in the 5th season.

B. The second universe was the new one that Amy brought to life after the Pandorica exploded and reset, no cracks, her parents existed, and Rory was human and alive again, and she also brought the Doctor back.

C.  House.  I specifically remember, unless I'm wrong, that the Doctor talked about going to a parallel universe to follow the message cube's trail.  Then returning to the previous universe at the end.

D.  A universe where the Doctor died vs. a universe where the Doctor doesn't die.  It was a fixed point, but the doctor got away once again at the end of the 6th season, changing the outcome through a loop-hole.

E.  That's all I can think of because the location of the Shakri ship was in ""another dimension.""  Maybe someone else can point out others?",0,1348500087,null,0,1348502949,0,c6cp7qv,t3_10cowg,t1_c6cp7qv,t3_10cowg,null,1429978698,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Aesir81,present,Fernando Torres,"I feel his biggest issue is positioning.  As Torres is my #1 guy, I'm always watching his movement off the ball and I always get really excited when he receives it.  

**Crosses**

I feel as if he is often out of position during crosses.  It can be difficult to predict where the cross will go, but he's often so far out of position that he is unable to even jump for a header, much less present a decent chance of winning one.  In this regard, his timing seems off.  A well-timed run would consist of a strong last minute sprint and jump into the air, using force and forward momentum to connect with the ball and hopefully deliver a decent attempt.  Rarely does this ever happen with Torres.  With crosses, most of the time, he's either standing semi-motionless in the box by the time the ball arrives or he's 10+ yards away watching it sail past.

**Passes**

Generally, Torres does a better job receiving passes than crosses.  This is not surprising, considering his background.  I still feel that a huge gap in his game is the turning and shooting (what Drogba excelled at).  Rarely does Torres ever attempt this.  Instead, he opts to either turn and face his defender, attempting to beat him in a one-v-one dribble, or he holds the ball and looks for the perfect pass to feed someone else through.

Unsurprisingly, the one-v-one dribble rarely works without significant pace.  With feeding others through, this has not worked well lately because the new additions to our team (while hands-down amazing) have unintentionally narrowed the width of our attack.  As a result, more attackers and defenders are forced into the middle, making things more congested, and thus much harder for Torres to play the type of striking he seems determined to play.

If he cannot succeed in fixing these problems in the next few months, I fear it may only be a matter of time before things go sour for him.  A player of his magnitude should be able to adapt and I often worry that the decision makers will soon run out of patience.",0,1348500402,null,0,1348501111,0,c6cpags,t3_10daqg,t1_c6cpags,t3_10daqg,null,1429978727,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I think Moffat is doing a good job. I think they should give Rory a little more characterization, he's too largely defined by being Amy's hubby. The plots are generally entertaining and a lot lighter than previous seasons so far in S7. 

I think Matt Smith is excellent. He's not as innately affable as Tennant and lacks the grit of Eccleston but he's a good balance between the personalities and quirks of the two. I'm not really too well-versed on the old series stuff, so my opinion will probably be dismissed by the more hardcore here.

It's a really great company to work for, I work across the the office from them, they're working in providing content tools for universities. Lots of smart people making really cool products.

If you're doing the basic stuff in the kegs (syrup, yeast and water essentially) you just need to keep it warm for a day or so to get the yeast active, airing cupboards/boiler cupboards if they're big enough are ideal. I've wrapped a few towels around the keg as well to keep it insulated in the colder times of the year. 

If you're looking at making your own beer from scratch from buying boilers and the raw materials, you're going to need a lot more space and money! 

Just remember to disinfect everything! The keg, stirring spoons, anything that goes near your beer, get it washed. You'll be recommended to buy some (i think it's chlorine based, but I might be wrong) disinfectant when you're buying your equipment. 

As for what to brew, that's entirely up to you, but cider is hard to get wrong - you can make 'turbo cider' from pressed juice, yeast and a couple of demijohns, set up will cost you less than £30 including juice easily.

true,twistedpuppet,troughton,Troughton,"I loved Tennant's run as the Doctor. I was apprehensive when Smith was brought on board, but I was determined to give him a try at the very least, unlike most others I knew who were into the show and were basically screaming they'd never watch again.

I've loved Matt Smith's Doctor since his first episode. I've never had too  much of a problem with the writing until A Town Called Mercy. Up until then I felt that everything was pretty good. If it entertained me, it was good. But I just felt that in a Town Called Mercy, they forgot for a moment that they were writing for Matt Smith and not David Tennant. The story was by no means weak. It had some good parts to it. Nothing that seemed hokey or groan worthy. But the tone of the Doctor's character seemed off. 

I guess that's because since Smith came on board the Doctor has been fun and exciting, and more child-like(or child friendly). Then they bring up the Time War in a subtle manner and you see that he's still bothered by that beneath the happy-go-lucky attitude. 

I don't think the quality has gone down. I just think it was a bit jarring to have the Doctor's harsh reality shoved back to the forefront for a brief moment. 

Now, back on topic. To answer the OP's original question, yes.  Yes, there are people out there who still just enjoy the show. Sometimes we just get carried away. :)

Also, I would just like to point out here, as I often do offline, Doctor Who is a kid's show. Always has been. Always will be. You should be glad that this much thought and effort goes into something that is meant for a young audience instead of the schlock they normally get. My nephew is only a year old, but I want to show him Doctor Who, and I want him to enjoy it and see that there is more than just ""Do you see the clue[pause]? You do? [pause] That's right! It's there!""  (children's shows in the use for preschoolers are just frackin abysmal.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; If a TD is employed then AVB could feel undermined as he may not be given the opportunity to pursue the players he needs.

And this would differ how from the current situation, with Daniel Levy clearly in the transfer driving seat and AVB's primary transfer objectives for the season having been missed?

As AVB states in this article, he's worked with a director of football or similar at all of his previous clubs and would have no problem doing so again.  At Chelsea he actually recommended Baldini for the role, according to the Telegraph.  His official title according to the club has been ""Head Coach"" from day one, because it was always Levy's intention to return to the ""continental"" model, and this would certainly have been explained to AVB.

Essentially right now we have Levy himself acting as director of football or sporting director, choosing transfer targets in collaboration with the manager, sometimes identifying his own, and handling all negotiations.  He's simply looking to pass that role on to a football man with his own ideas and set of contacts so that we can go about player recruitment in a different way.  Practically speaking I don't see how that would change AVB's position - it's not like he has absolute control over transfers now and would be losing that.",0,1348505822,null,0,false,0,c6cqmbt,t3_10dw7w,t1_c6cqmbt,t1_c6cmqdl,null,1429979354,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Also given that these men would act as 'boyfriends' beforehand and there'd be a relationship formed prior to the assault/rape it may be difficult for them to report it, I saw on the news that in one trial the victim still regarded the defendant as being in a 'relationship' with her and was still being referred to as her 'boyfriend' during the trial by the victim. 

The fact the girl was underage and drunk in a house full of men should have been concerning but some 13 year olds do easily pass as over 16 (the age of consent) and police deal with those sorts of incidents all the time. With rape it's very important the victims come forward so there needs to be a support structure for those without parents to feel comfortable reporting the crime otherwise it's difficult to get a conviction. The police should also check for signs of rape when a girl is drunk at a party although to be fair they will be called to dozens of these cases a month and most of the time it won't be rape.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"it's nothing to worry about simply elliptical orbital groups, due to the various orbits which objects take around the sun we interact with different groups of orbital objects at various times - some pass by yearly but most are on cycles, short-period comets like for example the famous Halley's comment passes in a retrograde orbit which crosses our own ever 75ish years; Non-periodic comets take over two hundred years to complete a 'pass' but some objects and groups take even longer, currently we're entering a group which intersected our obit in a very long time, this is because unlike the objects in an orbit synced without ours their orbit is off-set so as to only intersect on certain passes - this is further confused by the gravity effect of other large bodies they pass (Jupiter) which varies their pass trajectory.  
  
These objects are part of a group we haven't crossed since 3114 BC, this was a fascinating time on earth and contains many meteor myths; source material records details of an Otz Valley impact but others including the famous portents of doom witnessed in Egypt, sometimes said to have been a partial cause of the wars which pulled apart the Sixth Dynasty (although only myth survives to account for such) but also thought to include the destruction of two cities in the Levant, the chaos in areas such as the Konya Plain and the Pisidian plains south of Anatolia, as Mellaart noted 'Burdur revert to nomadism after thousands of years of settled agricultural life' - although western science has no real answer for this traditional myth account it to a falling sky and great panic in the hearts of people who saw this.  
  
Although the event appears to have been significant globally the largest impact crater is relatively small in planetary impact terms and is thought to be the Burckle Crater measured at 30 km (18 mi) in diameter and located just east of Madagascar.  Some people account a large scale tsunami event to this impact and tie it to the many flood myths of the region such as the post-antediluvian proto-Sumerian myth 'After the flood had swept over, and the kingship had descended from heaven, the kingship was in Kish' and the many african tales including those of the Kwaya, Pygmy, and Ababua - it's also worth noting maybe that the pre-Xia ruling families of China ascribed their importance on earth to a flood surviving couple called Fuxi and Nuwa, although their prominence was not noted for another five hundred years or so; this is very similar to the Pygmy tale which goes 'Chameleon heard a strange noise, like water running, in a tree, but at that time there was no water in the world. He cut open the trunk, and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the earth. The first human couple emerged with the water. '  
  
Even on the other side of the world proto-mayan civilizations were affected, hence the date being marked as the very start of the long form calender.  haha, actually i made most of that up and shifted events by thousands of years - the world probably isn't going to end on 2012.",0,1348509653,null,0,1348509923,0,c6crmvg,t3_10dzxh,t1_c6crmvg,t1_c6cp6ap,null,1429979837,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think a problem is that the daily mail article, and others, are conflating the perverse enjoyment of photos of underage girls with those taken of people of the general populace.

In every day life you see people taking photos where the subject isn't aware regularly, and I think it is rarely distasteful, as they are often not taken purely - or even at all - taken lasciviously (and even when they are I do not think many consider it harmful). So long as they aren't attempting to, say, shoot up somebody's skirt, or linger to get multiple shots or something equally invasive, I don't think many people consider it harmful.

I'm assuming the difference people find here is that this subreddit apparently (I haven't looked) encourages the taking of photos of people purely for sexual gratification as a *past time*, and that they find this distasteful? Well, join the club. I do not know how you would eradicate this behaviour though. In general, taking a photo of somebody else is fairly innocent, as is posting it on the internet; how do you disambiguate?

EDIT: I should point out before the (probably total of five people) who read this make assumptions, I am NOT a free speech advocate and I personally believe this sort of behaviour should be forbidden by reddit's policy, and that the sub should potentially be closed. I only do not believe it is or should be a crime (that is unless somebody can come up with some remarkably robust legislation that doesn't criminalise far too many people). 

That said, I also do not think that the posting of photos taken of people without their knowledge should by definition be forbidden, however a community encouraging this behaviour as a past time for sexual gratification (if that's what this subreddit is!) cannot be healthy.",0,1348509769,null,0,1348510271,0,c6cro0m,t3_10dzsx,t1_c6cro0m,t1_c6cpzr2,null,1429979853,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I listed several different references from the Moffat / Smith era to former companions. 

&gt;Eleven has made references to them. As many if not more than some of the other incarnations. He mentions Rose Tyler and Jack Harkness in The Wedding of River Song. He calls the Brigadier only to find out that he's left it till too late. We see images of Rose and Donna in Let's Kill Hitler. He has appeared in an episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures. Kate Stewart is Brigadier-General Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart's daughter and he talks about his past time with UNIT with her. The references are there.

If what you want are references, and the references are there, then I'm honestly confused.

I like Dempsey, glad we have him, but right now I think our midfield needs Dembele, Sandro, Bale and Lennon way more. I would not even think of dropping any of them to make room for him in the squad. I'd probably actually prefer Sigurdsson to Dempsey a lot of the time too.

Rhodes does have a great goal-scoring record but thats from the lower leagues. Can't guarantee he can continue such a record in the PL. Could be another Jermaine Beckford.  We're not really in the position to take a risk. Likewise with Gary Hooper. 

 Would like to see us bring Carroll back from his loan. Failing that get in another striker. Someone who knows where the net is and can score in a league as demanding as the PL. Drogba would obviously fit this mould but we'd never be able to afford his wages and I can't really see him moving to another PL club. 

Falcoa is far too unrealistic even if it would be amazing. Cavani would also be a dream aquisition, but again very unlikely. Unless Suarez and Coates talk him into it. Huntelaar may be a bit more realistic.

Creating an indecent image of a child is illegal. The crime is taking rude photographs of somebody under the age of 18. It doesn't matter who you are or how old you are, you can break this law. What changes is how you're then dealt with by the justice system. The police might not even care if the offence is committed by a youngster.

For the record, it isn't actually illegal for you to view porn as far as I'm aware. It's illegal for somebody to sell it to you, but there's nothing actually stopping you from consuming it if that's what you're into. And you're a sixteen-year-old boy, of course that's what you're into!

What's weird is that you're allowed to die for your country at the age of 17. So next year, you're considered old enough to train in the Army, ship out to the desert and kill or be killed. Only a year later are you deemed old enough to enter a pub and buy a pint of lager from the bar.

I don't care that I'm a grown woman, I still reacted like a small child seeing Jurassic Park for the first time when DOAS aired, even if the doctor was an angrier version &amp; some of the comedic aspects overshadowed other plot devices. Same with ATCM, I was more excited for the Spaghetti Western setup/plot than focusing on the fact that Amy's hair might've been 3shades darker in this episode and how much of a clusterfuck that is for this season's timeline.

I think grof's question is why are teams more conservative away and aggressive at home?

The answer to this question is largely explained by the discrepancy in refereeing home vs away (although you'd never know it by the Lazio game...).

Stoppage time tends to be extended or curtailed to provide some advantage to the home team, the home team gets a statistical advantage in penalties called (especially in the box), and all of this adds up to a significant advantage for the home team.  This isn't necessarily a cognizant choice by the referees -- but statistically it stands up to scrutiny.

Because of this, many teams will tend towards the conservative -- limiting the chances for the opposing players (and referees) to put in goals, while playing aggressively at home to exploit the home/away refereeing gap.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"That's a really good question that often gets dismissed. 

I think a huge reason is that, unlike in most American sports, a draw is a possibility. An NFL team goes to an away match with the knowledge that they either win or lose. A soccer team goes into an away match with the knowledge that a draw is a decent result (in many cases). Obviously, you won't catch Tottenham playing for a draw away at Reading, or Manchester United playing for a draw most anywhere (with a few exceptions). 

Another difference is the possibility of counter-attacking. There's no such thing as counter-attacking in American football, or baseball, or a recognizable version in basketball. American football and baseball are games where the defensive phase and offensive phase are completely separated, with no transition between the two. In American football the defenders aren't even the same players as the offensive players.

Teams playing at home tend to have more of the ball, which affects their style of play. For example, they often feel more comfortable playing two strikers, knowing that their opponents will cede territory and their strikers will be more involved in the play.

Teams playing away often react to this by playing more defensively, but the possibility of counter-attacking and the fact that a draw can often be a great result make this a much more reasonable strategy than going to an American football game or baseball game with the goal of ""not losing"".

Sorry about the wall of text.

   1. They send you a report that describes your credit rating - it lists all the loans and such you've taken out and whether or not you repaid them.
   1. If there's anything you want to dispute, you contact them in writing asking them to investigate. Should be a pretty straightforward letter or email in this case: ""I dispute all the following transactions; I was the victim of identity theft. This has been reported to the police and given crime reference number 123456789"".
   1. If they fail to respond in 28 days, you contact them again. You **MUST** contact them between day 28 and day 56. You include what's called a ""Formal Notice of Correction"" which they **must** place on your credit file - this is just a brief description of the facts and will be very similar to what you told them earlier.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"Sure. I understand that he means journalism (perhaps circa 1984) as a dying institution, however, the state can be substituted in and it still makes linguistic and philosophical sense.

People, like Leigh, is representative of the set that of journalists and they are clinging on to something else. In this scenario he would like the state to enforce a tax to protect his preferred fiefdom, so the state becomes the institution he wants to ""hang on to"".

For me that's what the state was designed to do, take money and distribute that to favoured insiders. The private sector (ie the very rich) cannot exist without an equally powerful state to enforce everything from a favourable (no)tax system, private property, expand or protect markets through military operations, and perhaps most importantly intellectual property. In the latter category we have perhaps most importantly the corporation which is a construct to obfuscate liability and identity.

There are many examples where the state subsidises (legally or financially) organisations like the Duchy of Cornwall (CAP handouts), the monarchy (every which way), land owners (favourable taxation), banking (free money), Church of England (tax), the BBC, industrial grants, tax credits, the road network, healthcare costs, and even foreign dictators could be relevant here.

Of course, for that reading we need to reconcile why this is a ""dying institution"", but I would think that obvious. If you want to tackle the power of the ""private sector"" then there needs to be rearrangement in the state. But how is it dying? Even in a simple reading of the current situation the state is becoming morally and financially bankrupt with exploding inequality and debt.

I think through technological means and greater inter-migration (either physical or electronic) states are being stripped of power from the ""outside"". Events like the Egyptian revolution which was aided by Anonymous, Telecomix and other hackivists (one example was them working to successfully counter Mubaraks internet kill switch), more than hint at the creakiness of the state and the power of outsiders. In the future the TV will die (hopefully) and statists propaganda will have a much harder time being effective on the internet. I also believe new democratised monetary and electronic voting systems will be a few more nails in the coffin.

A further reading would be how Cameron is seemingly dismantling the state. Police, healthcare, etc, but I'll leave it there.

true,Snatchett,num26,,"This has been proven to not be main influence. Only saying this gives a false, and quite frankly, distasteful view of football.

This comes from a study by Moskowitz and Wertheim which they concluded ""unintentional referee bias"" was the major contributor to home advantage. 

But a more recent study found that a player plays better at home due to the crowd (this effect can be seen in all sports; let's not forget the recent Olymiad).

Here's some stats from the source article.

On average home teams enjoy:

    * 4.8% more successful passes

    * 8.9% more passes in the attacking half

    * 17.4% more entries into the penalty area

    * 20.6% more shots

    * 22.6% more shots on target

    * 24.3% more shots inside

""The data shows a clear reduction in the amount and effectiveness of attacking play away from home.  This reduction in the amount of possession in and around the opposing penalty area ultimately leads to a lack of chances, a lack of goals and a lack of points. In fact, Prozone analysis has shown that Premier League teams attempt 24.3% fewer shots, deliver 22.8% fewer crosses and score 28.9% less goals on their travels than they would at home.""

""The effect of this more defensive style of away performance, and the incentive to approach away fixtures with a more attacking mindset, can be seen when you analyse statistics from the last five Premier League seasons. During that time the team that has had the most number of shots on goal in a match has a 79% chance of avoiding defeat and a 53% chance of walking off with all three points.

""Therefore, it would appear that the key to a successful away performance is to take a risk and attempt to attack as you would at home. While tradition and rational dictates that a more defensive approach is an appropriate tactic when playing away from home, Prozone’s analysis suggests that a more offensive set-up could be more effective. This can be seen in Arsenal’s away performances in the 2010/11 Premier League season where they opened up more away from home and in the process scored 39 away goals (13 more than their closest rivals) and picked up 31 points. This would seem to add credence to the idea that while there is an undoubted need for away teams to protect themselves away from home by covering up at the back and plugging the gaps in midfield, finding a way to gain possession in the attacking half, maintain a decent number of attacking entries into the opposition area and create a significant amount of attempts on goal is statistically the more effective way to gain a result in away fixture.""

But if it never gets better again, I can't claim to love it anymore. I mean, what's the point in saying you love a show you no longer enjoy?

I don't understand the idea of unconditional love. Especially not a tv show. That's just ridiculous. What makes even less sense, though, is the type of obsession that doesn't allow a person to criticize something, even when it's bad.

A Town Called Mercy was great. The Power of Three and Dinosaurs on a Spaceship were horribly horribly embarrassing. I'm hoping next week's episode is better.

You know what annoys me more than that, though?

Most of the posts on this subreddit are constantly fawning over every single episode of Doctor Who, no matter how good or bad it is. Yeah, I know that some people are going to love an episode, no matter what I think of it. But everyone, constantly, just talks about how great it is. I very rarely see people complain, which is why I dislike this subreddit. It makes me feel incredibly alone.

Of course people on this subreddit are going to disagree with people who complain about the show. People get weirdly obsessive about their fandoms. Pardon me for bringing religion into this, but this post is kind of like saying, ""I'm tired of the atheists complaining about prayer in schools in this country."" It's ridiculous.

He's capable of being shit,   because he is left out of the starting lineup for 75% of the time. Every player plays shitty now and then, especially when your work is to manoeuvre around defenders you're not familiar with and score. Same goes for tevez and aguero, I see shitty games by them as many as I see from Dzeko. Imo hes better than Tevez and Balo. Dzeko is being passed not enough balls from the side, he's most of the time the tallest player on the field and has good heading skills. When Silva is playing, the ball is almost always played back to silva from the side. When u play like this you either don't want silva on the field or you don't want dzeko on the field. Instead if u make Y. toure play more upcoming aggresive and have him pass long balls during counters, the combination of having Dzeko/(balo)+Aguero/(balo) is a far better formation then any other formation. For the video, all he meant to show were his long distance shots tbh and not his overall game capability as football is more than just finishing I hope the people here aswell as OP realize this. I'm not sure if Mancini is optimizing his attack on views of who the team is facing. The combinations should differ from what team is being played, lenght,speed,defence,attack rate are factors that should be considered the vital reasoning for picking the combination. However instead I believe mancini picks his players based on their last game(s) form, which is a bit amateuristic but I could be wrong.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"&gt; The jump

You can't have crony capitalism or corporate socialism with out the state. The state is the enabler, and I'd argue the state has always been designed to facilitate this starting with constructs like the royal charter and the monarchy itself. Free market capitalists never actually want a free market, because it would pose immense risk for the rich and wouldn't be as profitable. In fact markets just don't exist without governance. Imagine a market where there was no corporate-hood and you had to interact on personal merit. (You also couldn't avoid inheritance tax because you would die.) Imagine a market where there was no copyright or patents (why should there be?!).

""Hang on to"" evokes the needy, the beggar, the desperate, and some other thing. ""People"" could be representative of journalism in his writing, so there would exist some other thing to be the ""dying institution"".

&gt; You were downvoted because your question was vague

I'd disagree. The question was overtly unambiguous, with a yes/no answer. But yes, of course I was playing with people's prejudices and poor understanding of the public/private illusion, and the movable definition of what we call the state. Your explanation does have one truth, too many people think with and act on their gut.

A further question when we have worked out what the state is (if that is even possible) would be why is the loss of the state a necessary evil? Why is it even a taboo subject, like criticising the monarchy, the role of organised sport, the BBC, capitalism, soldiers, or Israel? Where has this training come from where people respond emotionally to something inescapably intellectual? States go to war, states hold captive political prisoners, states ruin economies for the majority, states create huge propaganda machines like the BBC. States take your money and give it to favoured institutions. States deport you to other states in extraordinary renditions and by more transparent means.

I'm inclined to think and talk of the state as a process rather than a noun. Because people are involved then the process can become an aim. I think currently it isn't controversial to say the collective activity needs to shift slightly, and if that means the death of the state so something better can take it's place, then long live the state.",0,1348522983,null,0,false,0,c6cvb52,t3_10d2av,t1_c6cvb52,t1_c6cullw,null,1429981634,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Also, when you're locking yourself into a 2 year contract that you need extraneous circumstances to be able to get out of, I don't think it's possible to do too much research. 

Well, put it this way: you buy (which most people *don't* have to) a cheap phone, and get to use your minutes/text/internet you pay for every month, or you don't get to use your allowance and you've wasted money anyway, in not using the services you pay for every month.

How many do you propose they have? I'm sure somebody in an office had to do a cost/benefits comparison for how many would be suitable. Sure, you got unlucky, but we've had 15 loan phones all out back at one time because they were simply not needed. When you see something like you think ""Gee, there must be enough."" But no, we did have shortages sometimes. These things just happen, most people just suck it up and buy a cheap phone.

I'm not sure where I lumped everyone together, considering that I am now a customer and not an employee so why would I? It was not my intention to do so - I was referring to a particular subset of customers, not all of them.

Of course it isn't, but that wasn't the point. The point was when you do have signal, compared to other networks. Not that it seems you'll upgrade with Three, but it isn't irrelevant considering they've changed all contracts to be either unlimited or 250MB, and I was just expanding on Hammyman's point as you claimed to misunderstand her/his final paragraph.",0,1348524459,null,0,false,0,c6cvp22,t3_10e5fg,t1_c6cvp22,t1_c6cvge6,null,1429981813,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,digitalpencil,eng-manchester,Manchester,"Concern for what? For public morality? For reddit's image? The children? That's the thing, i see these mini-protests, participated in like they amount to something where the only people who discuss or care about them, are already users of this site. That's what I want to know, who are you protesting? Who is the voice that will fix the problems you perceive as being so rife amongst this site? SRS has peddled a story about a website who's sole job is to provide a forum for public discource, by saying ""look what some of these shitmongers look at on the internet"". The only reason it got bandwidth in the first place is because the tabloids understand that they'll receive clickthroughs from redditors. So i suppose the bigger question is, what exactly is the point of this demonstration? Who are we hoping to convert to our way of thinking?

I don't find it to be cause for concern, I think when you give people a voice, you won't necessarily like everything they have to say and that reddit's responsibility is not to police its users morality outside of the established law but to focus upon enhancing and encouraging the growth of that very service that provides those people a voice.

Creepshots is bizarre, certainly. Personally i find it creepy but I suppose that's the point. Frankly though i find it shortsighted that of all places to bait into a supposed debate over perceived morality, the Daily Mail was one of the chosen targets. You've got a tabloid who've made a name for themselves by printing provocative paparazzi shots taken and printed without the subject's consent, running a story about a forum of users who post pictures of provocative paparazzi shots taken without the subject's consent. Not to mention the fact that it's subscription is represented by less than a percent of reddit's overall userbase so how exactly this is supposed to be a representative cross-section is as absurd as it is fruitless.

SRS won't stop, next it'll be stories about r/podk and while they're at it, they may as well throw /r/4chan into the mix as well. The saving grace of it all though is simple, it will achieve absolutely nothing. Reddit will continue to grow, tabloids will continue to run stories to receive ad revenue and no-one's heart or mind will be changed at all.
If SRS gave a damn about people's morality, they'd appeal to their sense of reason but they don't, they hide behin tired memes and a smug smile of superiority because when it comes down to it, that's all it is. A way to feel superior than everyone else.

The beginning of TPo3 was excellent--intriguing, displayed key character traits/flaws of 11, showed a bit more of the new Rory's Dad character, had Darvill in pants, gave us a bit of 'confused Doctor', let Smith show off his football skills--all excellent.

But that element of intrigue left too soon, and wasn't replaced with the usual thriller-esque writing, but rather a deus-ex-machina and a bitty reference to the Brigadier.

Black Spot was not 7, but I agree that it was very child-friendly compared to how I like my Who. Still, one of those a season (max) is a good thing.

Being neither female nor unable to have children, I don't pretend to be able to understand, but my point is that it really does cause very strong, independent women to question themselves and their worth as a partner.  Whether you liked it or not as a plot element, it's a very real fact that couples DO often split up/divorce over the inability to have children.

**Possible origin** (source; [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_of_Boe#Possible_origin))

*In the episode ""Last of the Time Lords"", the immortal time traveller Captain Jack Harkness expresses concern about how he might look if he lives ""for a million years"", because although he cannot die, he is still aging, albeit slowly. He tells the Doctor and Martha Jones that it's a matter of vanity, because as the first person from the Boeshane Peninsula to join the Time Agency, he was featured on posters, becoming known as ""the Face of Boe"". The implication of this astonishes Martha and the skeptical Doctor.*

*Writer Russell T Davies, in the episode's commentary, called the implication of this scene ""a theory"" as to the Face of Boe's origins, prompting Executive Producer Julie Gardner to urge him to ""stop back-pedaling"" about the two characters being the same. Davies also said that after writing the scene he inserted a line in the ADR recording for ""Gridlock"" in which the Face of Boe calls the Doctor ""old friend"". However, Davies does not like making the relationship explicit, stating ""the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies"". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.*

The best way to work is to simply voice typical mail opinions, but make it so ridiculous that real mail readers find themselves questioning their own thought processes.

You know, when they attack the disabled, come in with a comment about how most people know that the disabled usually put it on, then something about how your sister who lost a leg and her unborn child in a car accident was a sponger and ought to accept that in this life, she loses.  Something even hateful bastards recoil from, even though they usually think along those lines.

It usually gets past the moderators, who just scan it and think 'yeah, that's our kind of thinking'.

I'll admit instantly I was pretty biased about Donna because I've never been a fan of Catherine Tate. I went in wanting to hate her. But I went in wanting to hate Smith as well but I adored him within 5 minutes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This ""class"" thing is probably worth explaining to our US readers. In the UK when we refer to the middle classes, it is the class, not the income. So if you were born working class and earned a low wage you would be low wage earning working class. If you earned $20m a year you would be a very high earning working class boy. You do not move classes necessarily. Now if you become a professional and you move to Islington and call your offspring Tabatha and Ollie and then you are a middle-class wannabe. That doesn't mean you have achieved middle-classness, just every knows that's what you are trying to do.

Now, let's say you are born Lord Futhemcluck-F'narr Willoughby and attend Eton. You are definitely upper class. Even if you are a moron who's only skills mean a job cleaning a pub toilets, you are and will remain upper class. Some people, like certain prime ministers, have attempted to move downclasses by moving to Islington and calling their kids Freddie and Beth, but now and again a photo of them bashing the oiks with dead foxes at university will pop up and remind us all of their roots. If you are lucky enough to been born of the gentry (*mentally doffs cap*) you have hit the lottery of life here because even if your family is poor and you are socially inept, you are very likely to end up with an excellent job or at the very least a commission in the guards, or become a Vicar. Or an estate agent selling houses to your friends 'downclassing' in Islington.

Now if your Dad is a dentist or an engineer and earns fairly decent money and you live somewhere leafy and go to a nice school, paid or not, chances are you are middle class. Dressing in a tracksuit, listening to rap and speaking like a Jamaican gangster won't make you any less middle class. Or less white. So you may as well accept your fate, go to a red brick university, get a good education, a nice job, add a kilo of weight per year and move to Islington and call your kids Daphne and Victor. And start ranting about stories in the daily mail.

Honestly, I think Moffat's team has some AMAZING character development writing skills (not so much in this episode. This is worst episode of Seasons 5-7 in my opinion,) but they are trying WAY too hard (and failing equally hard,) to be epic story writers. Time travel stories are difficult to write intricately and it's three times as hard to make them understandable (watch Primer for a really complicated but thoroughly-written time travel tale). They're trying to do this all and have strong character development too and it's failing.

I miss the days of RTD. They were episodic, fun, and there was some over-arching story but they stayed within their limits (usually) and grew slowly. I think part of the problem with Moffat is RTD had four years as head writer to grow his team, and because Moffat was there from the beginning, he wanted to start off his series on the same level, but he aimed too high and is falling short.",0,1348533625,null,0,false,0,c6cxzss,t3_10b4hz,t1_c6cxzss,t1_c6c2xxn,null,1429982899,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
