While it's true, some of these players can play other spots, most of these guys can double as an AM which already has a line of world class players waiting to get in. Out of those 8 players I think only Essien can play a spot that actually might have an opening (LB,RB). Which means even if we sent McEachran out on loan ***AGAIN*** (bad idea IMO) and moved Essien to defense or sold him, we still have too many DMs.

I was quite shocked by the reaction to that piece. I do place a lot of importance on privacy, but equally I've been reading recently about big data approaches to healthcare, both in research and the clinic, and it strikes me that the technique has huge potential. GPs are at present placed in an incredible, and somewhat ludicrous position of responsibility. They are tasked with selecting out relevant information for the patient at hand from the absolutely enormous medical literature (which would take millenia to read, and which is increasing at an exponential pace), and doing so within a 15 minute appointment. It's obvious there's enormous potential for improvements. If you have a rare genetic disease, you're likely not to come out of this process very well. Or it might be that the (rather nasty) side-effect of statins are down to a particular genetic variant. A clinical database would mean that picking out a connection like that would be trivial. There's potential for reaping useful (and free) medical research from every single medical case. As long as good procedures are put in place to protect the information (for instance, any access to the database could be automatically recorded, so that the patient could see if anyone was selling information), it seems like an enormous step forward.",0,1355188420,null,0,false,0,c7ejp8a,t3_14lh86,t1_c7ejp8a,t1_c7e7ygk,null,1430637951,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"When I started following football, I thought I liked United, but it quickly occurred to me that there were no downs, only ups, and to me, *that* was fake. So I switched to a club that was as different as possible. A club that has had *real* ups and downs, a club that is arguably defined by it's ability to go from up to down and back again seemingly over night. 

Where you're from has nothing to do with your fandom. I'm not from Britain either, but I know for a fact that United has a huge number of foreign fans. I know more than a few of them, and it's been my experience that many of them are, like I said, only mildly engaged, and just like united because they're big and good. So forgive me for mistaking you for one of them. 

It was a pretty easy mistake, given your comment about City fan's ""true selves"" being coin throwing, Ferdinand charging ass holes. There are a few of those, but there are at every club. On the whole I have found City fans to be among the kindest, and most earnest football fans out there, and anyone who has spent any time with them would know that. From your comment, it was clear that you didn't know anything about city, and so naturally I assumed that you didn't know sht about your club either.

It's clear from your vitriolic response that you are far more emotionally involved in your club than your original comment would suggest, but those emotions seem to be limited to hating city, and if that's the range of things, I'm definitely glad I switched allegiances when I was still young.

true,Predevil,lfc68,,"I like it. I like all supporters of any club from anywhere. Football is a worldwide sport, Liverpool is a worldwide city/club. I see no reason why anyone would have negative views of people outside of x city supporting x team. This is of course providing there is no bandwagoning.

In regards to the Liverpool/Everton rivalry, i'd say it's a bigger deal to people from Liverpool, whereas people from outside probably see Liverpool/Man U as a bigger ""derby"". My dad is a blue, and for everyday of the year except for (atleast) 2, there is just us enjoying football. When the days come where we play Everton, it's just brotherly love and rivalry between the clubs. Liverpool and Everton are like brothers fighting. Liverpool and Man U is something much more.

All I can say is, to me, you're just as much as a supporter of the club if you're from Liverpool or not. It's all about the passion you have for the club. I live maybe, 20 odd minutes from Anfield, but a guy who lives 20 hours away is no less of a fan than me. I'm lucky, I can go the match if I can grab a ticket, it's that simple for me. I've been to all the home Europa games this season, and i've been to atleast 1 prem game every season for the past ~10/11 years. I feel that if half the people on this subreddit could have it as simple as me, they'd be at the match every possible time, and to me, that's all that matters, it's just shitty luck you weren't born in our great city. :&gt;

Closer to home, my professor at university worked his way up to the head honcho role, running a fairly sized lab with very strong ties with, and funding from industry. Most of his time is spent managing research projects, securing funding and deciding the future of our lab, as well as having significant input as to the future of related industry. It is not a stretch for me to imagine him on an advisory science and/or industry panel for the government. He's an enthusiastic guy and really knows his stuff.

Torres was my hero when he was at Liverrpool.

I'm new Zealander so watching the reds usually involves getting up at 2,3 or 4 am; something I've been doing ritualistically for years.

My favourite Liverpool FC memory is probably sitting in the lounge at about 3Am on a Monday morning, when no one else is up and I'm craddling a cup of tea and eating scrambled eggs and then Torres pull this out of his ass.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M98tj5AlGqg

Probably watched that goal about 200 times now. Naturally I started going as wild as you can when your'e alone and trying not to wake you're dad up. One of my best memories.

true,Flamekebab,null,null,"Well the simple answer is this: just because they want to profit doesn't mean they will.

Hard work does not, in reality, equate to a reward.

Sometimes it does, but not always. Business is based on risk/reward in an ever-changing environment.

If a label spends £x it hopes it will make more than that back. If it doesn't it won't survive, but it is its job to pay attention to the environment and make the right calls.

So let's put it another way:

A new genre of music emerges that immediately takes off amongst 15 - 25 year olds. The old stuff still sells but nowhere near as well. Most labels don't have artists that play that genre and so the money they invested in the old stuff doesn't give anywhere near the returns they'd predicted. Argh!

Should we feel sorry for them? They gambled, they knew there were risks, they lost.

When they win they make an absolute killing and it's their job to try to win. However sometimes things shift and their old strategy becomes old hat.

The bell cannot be unrung, the new music isn't going to disappear. Probably a good idea to try to get the hang of producing the new stuff and quickly before those debts get called in.

----
The same thing applies with the internet. The genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Things have changed, just like they always do, so adapt or die.

Personally, yes, music has been devalued for me.

That said I would be happy to pay for TV content in a Steam setup. With sales of similar kinds. At the moment I do not pay for TV content but would happily buy a load of things in a sale if they were attached to my account. That way I wouldn't need to keep the files, I could simply redownload them should I want them, or stream them if I wanted a particular episode.

At the moment a system that I like using exists for games but not for TV. Before Steam took off I pirated virtually everything, often the old fashioned way.

These days I prefer to buy games because it's affordable and convenient. The only games I avoid buying at full price and pirate are the big releases. Even then if I think they're worthwhile I'll buy them when they're on sale.

Had I bought Dishonored at release price I would have been extremely disappointed, for example. As a result I'd want my money back.

On the other hand I pirated Saints Row The Third and loved it so much I bought it and a season pass for its DLC. I even bought it again in the recent Humble THQ Bundle!

Offer me a value proposition I'm interested in and I'll pay. Demand more than I think it's worth and I'll just take it for free (and usually reject it).

I'm willing to wait longer in order to get it at a better price. For example Deus Ex: HR. I didn't pirate it, I bought it in this year's Steam Summer Sale. Still haven't played it. It was, however, offered at a price point I was happy to accept. Now it sits on my virtual shelf awaiting my attention.

We were talking about how the FA could act differently, not what is racism and it's solutions. We were discussion how to regulate the observable.

So far they have to options, 1: there is no case, which is legal speak for ""negro is now acceptable"" and could possibly lead to other people forming their own opinion on which other words are ok, 2: When something is unacceptable in one region where the FA is, other regions are irrelevant to the case. 

Which brings us to the only conclusion from the Suarez/evra case, there is no way to let suarez who admitted to having used ""negro"" go in england without opening the gates for racists.

I don't like the outcome, but there is no other possible outcome, it's better for each club to educate their players than to start opening racism cases weekly.

Racism is very subjective and has different level of what people consider racism. If suarez doesn't get match ban, JT doesn't and suddenly one of the biggest organizations in england which represents the biggest sport in england accepts what a potion of the players and civilians call racism, there you have it. Ban couple of players while acknowledging they are not racists, and let clubs take care of their players, or make unenforcable law on something subjective that will occur frequently.


I don't see any other way but giving him match ban and admitting he is not racist. It must be shity for him to be put in that position, but it will be something that clubs will seriously consider and hopefully will never happen again.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Well, it does partly depend on the nature of his schizophrenia, but people [don't normally get that sort of diagnosis these days if they're just having the odd fugue state](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Schizophrenia/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx), he's presumably experienced extended bouts of non-drug-related disordered thinking, paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations over long periods of his adult life.

I don't think there's any dispute he did something which nearly ended two people's lives, I understand the anger and fear which that generates, and he's obviously currently a danger to himself and the public.  I don't even dispute that, in the end, the outcome is essentially the correct one - he's going to a secure hospital for treatment, rather than a prison for punishment, and no lawyer worth their salt is likely to recommend an insanity plea these days except under highly unusual circumstances, because the consequences of doing so are usually worse for a defendant than to not go this route.  That's actually the real problem, the UK law on insanity sucks and is hopelessly out-of-date compared to most mainstream psychiatric and legal opinion.

Anyway, back to the point.  Obviously, neither of us have the court papers in front of us, but on the evidence here (and that I've read elsewhere), it seems highly probable he was in a fugue state when this incident occurred.  Even the police spokeswoman in the video takes the time to express sympathy for Christopher Haughton and his family, she obviously doesn't simply see him as some evil man with a desire to kill police officers, and views him as partly a victim of this incident too even though he was the one with the knife.

So, murder and attempted murder.  We've shown that the actus reus is obviously present - he did do actions more than merely preparatory to ending these officers lives, he stabbed them in a potentially fatal manner, indeed at least one was lucky to survive.  But the mens rea?  The mens rea for attempted murder is actually harder to prove than that for murder.

I've tailgated at the Patriots, been in, uh, altered states of mind at music festivals, went to a Sox-yankees baseball game the day after a benches clearing brawl...I have never had as much fun at a sports event as I did pub hoping before the Roma match. 

Every one of the generously numbered bars around Fenway was packed with the most diehard of fans from across the pond, those special types who will fly across an ocean to show the fans from far flung provinces their full back European Cup tattoos. Those that leave waitresses and bartenders with their mouths agape, used to a genteel sort of NEW England MLS crowd, having their preconceived notions of *soccer* fans shattered before them. Ah, yes. I went down early and by myself, but I did nothing but laugh when a climbing buddy asked if I was worried about being in a crowd that size alone. 'Never', I replied.

My seat was next to two of the previously discussed types of gentlemen. Best friends from the Motherland. They were in high spirits through the first half, screaming 'Get your hands off your knees, you lazy fuck!' at Joe Cole, and other such traditionally warm gestures. Half comes, and a group not used to Fenway has to navigate the dungeons below to scavenge for food and bathrooms. Friend 1 next to me doesn't reconnect with friend 2 until about the 60 minute mark, when his buddy returns with two soft serve ice creams in hand. Touching, really.

Well, 63rd minute, Roma scores. Friend 1 purses his lips, and spikes his ice cream onto the ground with the satisfying pop from the cone. The furiously furrowed brow of friend one contrasted with the shock and betrayal from friend two, who missed a quarter of the game to retrieve those cones overshadowed any feelings I could muster for a goal in a friendly.

I think there's definitely merit in the idea that the record label model is outdated, and an industry in which the vast vast majority of the money goes to anyone except the actual musicians is ridiculous and always has been.  The problem is, despite there being constant assertions that the technology and the internet now provides all the tools bands need to record and distribute their own music, the number of artists that have actually achieved any kind of success doing this can be counted on one hand.  

Even if the music industry has made some toe-in-the-water attempts to move on, people haven't.  We still overwhelmingly buy stuff that is signed to and promoted by big corporate labels.  And that's still predominantly the stuff we download from torrent sites too.  The majority of the great general public aren't trailblazers seeking out new bands and trying new things.  They like to buy what other people are into, or stuff that is recommended.  And that's nearly always commercially produced music from one of the majors or their sub-labels.

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"The UK Government has a pretty good overview of how gas prices have changed and how this compares to domestic bills, with figures updated to December 2012. It's available in a [PDF](http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN04153.pdf).

I've extracted a graph of wholesale gas prices from that paper, which stretches back to 2007. To show the trend over the same time period as my original graph, I've put in a base line at October 2010, to show the increase since that point. [Take a look](http://i.imgur.com/ziPy8.png). Prices spiked right at Oct 2010, jumping by around 30%, but have been relatively flat since.

These are spot gas prices, what is called ""day ahead"" in the trading/market terminology. Power companies tend to quote ""month ahead"" or ""3 months ahead"" markets, as they smooth out the daily fluctuations a little. I can't find a suitable graph on those numbers, unfortunately, but when a market is in an upward trend (""contango""), I would imagine that the jump at Oct 2010 on day ahead prices had already been priced into the 3 month market.

What's clear is that there haven't been many moves on prices since, and yet prices for customers have continued to rise, to the point where we're paying around 28% more for our gas, on average.

To quote from the report:

&gt;There was a large amount of volatility after the summer 2008 peak in oil prices, but these daily wholesale prices did not start to fall until February 2009. They reached their recent low of around 0.5 pence per kWh in early autumn 2009. The first domestic price cuts following these price falls did not happen until February 2010. They averaged 6%, a similar price cut to that seen a year earlier. Wholesale prices increased steadily back up to around the 2.0 pence per kWh level from early 2011 onwards.

Power companies always claim a lag in their retail prices reflecting wholesale prices, but it seems to me that they've been much quicker to pass on price increases than falls.

Politicians are groomed to agree with and walk along the line of the government. If the government doesn't want drug legalisation, then an MP who stands for the opposite won't get very far up the political ladder. It's why labour, tory and lib dem are all pretty much the same and nothing changes; it's the same system of government no matter which party is in power. Labour for example is supposed to be a party for the working class, historically, a socialist party. Yet if there was a labour MP who wishes for the working class to take over the means of production and for capitalism to be overthrown in this country (i.e. if said MP was a socialist), what's the likelihood of that MP getting *anywhere* in his/her political career? They definitely won't get anywhere within the labour party. The most they can hope for is being a radical back-bench MP with no influence whatsoever.

Last season I felt we should have been 3rd, even more so than before. I don't need to remind anyone what happened last season. In my eye we'd blown 3rd for the second time in three seasons and blew CL qualification two seasons running.

There was a lot of negativity this summer, in some peoples minds Redknapp was a genius and AVB was some loser, even though the latter is clearly a better manager. Even so there were a lot of people who were upset that we sold Modric and VDV and believed that Dembele and Dempsey were ""poor replacements"". I couldn't agree and felt they had the potential to be as productive as the two they replaced, if not more so. So far it looks like I'm winning that argument. 

We're certainly capable of top 3 this season but we've had some massive injury problems and I feel it's cost us. What would have happened if we'd had Kaboul at the back against Everton?

Might as well not bother taking that - it does fuck all for any real levels of pain. 

I have three fucked discs in my back and it is inoperable with pain levels equivalent of childbirth apparently and it did fuck all for me other than rip my stomach lining out. 

All they will do is send you to a pain relief clinic which is a stinking pit of despair. My GP prescribed the same drugs the clinic would but for me it made little difference so I no longer take them as the side effects aren't worth it. 

If you want to get to see the specialist quicker, go for a consultation privately. You can still get your treatment on the NHS but you'll speed up the wait for the consultant which is the longest part of waiting. I think it is around £100 for the appointment.

In short, yes you can go to your GP but you're going to have to learn to mentally switch off to it because no drugs are going to take it completely away. I've had mine for the thick end of two decades.

Kubuntu, which uses the extremely stable KDE desktop is a very nice 'workhorse' - in our office about 70% of people are running Kubuntu - Windows 7 on the same machine is slower at pretty much all tasks I do (and you can;t do a lot of things I want to) - the more you use KDE the better it becomes - unlike gnome3//unity where the most you use it the more you realise they your prevented on using the desktop as you like - unlike the other 2 KDE allows you to tweak most settings (if you can be arsed) - One nice advantage of Kubuntu is all Ubuntu packages work but you donlt have to use their crappy unity desktop (which Windows copied with Windows8)

&gt; such simple things as multi-monitor support can be a friggin nightmare.

Not if you a Nvidia user - twinview is excellent and just as easy as Windows ... I only have ever used Nvidia cards however I know for fact that KDE has multiple monitor support for all GPUS. (twin view is Nvidia only). 

In kde for non nvidia cards go to System settings -&gt; Display and monitors -&gt; enable multiple monitors - that was pretty easy...

Having a choice of desktops is a good thing, if you don't like one desktop, find one you do like ...

I feel sorrry for Windows users as Windows 8 is their future - What choice do Windows8 users have in terms of desktop choice? (apart from suicide)

Although I would just say use KDE, for example my pissy samsung netbook cannot do anything with Windows7 (its just to slow to use sensibly) - the same machine flies running E17 (bodhi Linux) - and who cares about what desktop you are using if the applications you run work on all of them ?

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;I work in this industry

I think one of the issues I do tend to have with this is that the industry isn't really representative.  I do some work for a folk festival and ended up doing a talk on copyright a couple of years ago, simply because people were interested and a bit confused..  When you have 100+ musicians, none of whom are represented by the music industry, all of which play music most weekends you have to realise that the industry and 'music' aren't really the same thing.

There are a lot of people who make and perform music who don't see themselves in the industry, a lot of people who just want to produce music (and indeed labels that are pushing the open and free line..). Not to mention quite a few people who have managed to use work without the rights to do so to make money and then figuratively pulled the ladder up behind them.

So, we have two issues really, one is that copyright as it currently stands is pretty broken.  Its excessive and people are pushing to extend it rather than rationalise what is actually beneficial to the public and artists.  The second is that in fighting piracy, you end up in a strange situation where you do broader damage and essentially harm the creative aspect of the industry (look at the block of the promo-bay, or the take down of music and video from youtube without real cause).

This particular problem isn't about music, or copyright though, it is about who has the ability to censor the web.  At present the approach seems to be to test the water on whether commercially led site-blocking can work.  I would argue that its dangerous (we have already seen copyright claims being used to take down legitimate, non music/film etc.. related sites).  I would also argue that the playing field isn't level, you have large US corporates running streaming sites that link to material that they don't have licenses for, being protected by the first amendment, whilst the rights-holders go after smaller non-US organisations that try to do the same thing.. That harms innovation (and it is fair to say that most of the innovation we have seen has been despite the industry and most of the successful platforms dealt with the legal aspects only when forced..).

So, should a proxy be seen as infringing? It doesn't seem to make much sense in the UK, the pirate bay isn't blocked by all ISPs, there are a whole host of proxies, not to mention massive numbers of public and private trackers... why try to shut one down? I assume it is to send a message more than anything else, because there aren't many good arguments that would fly if you applied them broadly. 

&gt;But let's just say for an example you walked into the pirate party HQ, torrent freak HQ or your average Joe downloader's house and started walking out with all of their hard drives and data ( it's only 0's and 1's after all yeah ) It'd be a different story then. It'd be theft. End of.

It'd be theft if you walked out with the hardware, it would be something else if you walked out with the data.  That's really quite important.  On the Pirate Party side, you can probably find and use most of the things that they have digitally quite legally, the only aspects that would likely cause you problems are personal data (and not for copyright reasons..).

But you are right in the sense that if people want to pirate and aren't interested in the other issues then that's up to them.

Not from a support point of view. Say someone says to me ""I've got a problem, I'm running Linux Mint 14"". I've now got to figure out which one of the four desktops they're using because they won't know and try and remember how each one works.

Also, lets keep things in perspective here: you speak of laws as if the FA was actually a part of the government charged with creating them.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"I had very few problems getting dihydrocodeine, Tramadol and co-codamol from my GP when I had issues with pain due to fistula treatment. The angle I took was that in order for me to function at my job I needed something to take the edge off of the pain. It did take a little bit of time to convince them that I wasn't a junky, but once I convinced them that the need was genuine, I was very aware of what it was I was taking and how it would impact me (especially when it came to addiction), and that I was being sensible with the dose regulation I had no problems securing hundreds of DHC pills at a time. I was even able to switch from Tramadol to DHC by using terms like ""a cleaner high"" when I found that I can't take things which fuck with my serotonin levels.

But I need to be very clear about one thing. You need to be very careful about long-term use of opiate based pain killers. They are few effective with persistent pain, but they are also very addictive. When I chose to come off of the DHC (after 8 months of taking it multiple times a day, along with co-codamol) it took me about a month of slow dose reduction and I still had that god-awful feeling of cold-to-the-bone emptiness which utterly consumes you. Be careful about that.

What you need to do is make it very clear to your GP (or any GP in the office who will see you), that you are taking doses of OTC painkillers which are so far above the RDA that your worried about liver/kidney problems, yet they are having no effect on the pain. Ask if you can try 60/500 co-codamol 2 pills x4 a day to see if that is any better. If they mess you about, demand a 2nd opinion. My GP helped a lot with pain management whilst the hospital were treating me.

But again, be wary of opiate based pain killers. Not only did I have severe withdrawal, I literally spent 8 months of my life completely off my face 24/7, which strained a lot of relationships at home and at work.

redirection services;
* information about apparatus used by, or made available to, the subscriber or
account holder, including the manufacturer, model, serial numbers and apparatus
codes.
* information provided by a subscriber or account holder to a provider, such as
demographic information or sign-up data (to the extent that information, such as a
password, giving access to the content of any stored communications is not
disclosed).

**Use data** – Use data is information about the use made by any person of a postal or
telecommunications service. 

Examples of use data may include:

* itemised telephone call records (numbers called);
* itemised records of connections to internet services;
* itemised timing and duration of service usage (calls and/or connections);
* information about amounts of data downloaded and/or uploaded; 
* information about the use made of services which the user is allocated or has
subscribed to (or may have subscribed to) including conference calling, call
messaging, call waiting and call barring telecommunications services;
* information about the use of forwarding/redirection services;
* information about selection of preferential numbers or discount calls;

true,badge,eng-westmidlands,London from Brum,"Their job is to make as much money as possible, but there are very strict limits on the profits they are allowed to make. There are two main problems with gas, in particular. Firstly the U.K. has gone from a net exporter to a net importer of gas, and buying from the continent is always going to be more expensive than getting it from home. For this reason shale gas extraction is being pushed by the government, despite the risks involved. Secondly, the weather events of recent years have lead to high volatility in the spot price of power and gas.

Gas supply companies forecast what they will need largely based on weather. Most of the volume of the gas will be bought years and months ahead of time where the granularity (i.e. you are limited to buying blocks of six months of constant supply at a time) and price volatility are low. Part of the price of the gas to customers is the cost of the risk associated with the price volatility, and companies price in the risk so that (usually) 19 out 20 times they won’t lose money. If they get too many ‘1 in 20’ events (i.e. forecasts being wide of the mark), then they will have to buy gas at a high price (when it’s colder than expected) or sell gas at a lower price (when it’s warmer than expected). The volatility in the spot price of gas is enormous, but consumers are shielded from this by the energy companies, at the cost of overall higher-priced gas.

Gas, water and electricity are basic human needs, but the vast majority of the price increase is not due to companies’ greed but a failure of successive governments to foresee this predictable future and mitigate against it. We really should have been tackling this 20 years ago by concentrating on reducing our energy needs, building nuclear power stations and ploughing money into renewable energy production.

Homebrewing is brilliant! Be it wine, lager, ale, cider or other alcohol it's relatively cheap and easy to brew up a high quality batch.

For some perspective, after you've put down around £60 for equipment which includes bottles, tubs, tubes, hydrometers and the like (you won't need to re-buy any of this) you can find a kit which for around £10-£15 provide you with 40-50 pints of beer. We're talking less than 50p a pint! Oh and did I mention it can be ready to drink in of weeks?

The finished product doesn't taste like piss, it's stronger than your average over the counter beer and you can brew special drinks for occasions. I brewed a Christmas treacle stout which went down a hoot.

I'm sure your local friendly homebrew store will set you up with a nice beginners deal and some pearls of wisdom.

&gt; Do you have a recipe to the cheapest good tasting beer you can make yourself with basic equipment? Can you make your own red wine that doesn't taste shitty? Is that as economical?

Sure, if you want to have a rolling stock of grog you might need three buckets and lots of bottles and it will cost a little bit more. But the brew always ends up paying for itself, assuming you don't go out of your way to buy beers from the shop.

If you are budgeting or are a beginner leaning the methods then go with an all in one kit (these produce good quality beer if done right!).
With kits you get a large can of ""ready-to-go"" mix which you pour into a tub. Comes with instructions regarding sugar, hops, water, volume, etc. Beer kits hover around the 10-15 pounds cider a bit more and wine at 30 pound mark. All of these prices assume 5 gallons.

When it comes down to actual recipes then that's more of an all-grain brewing method which is where you actually buy the grains and specific hops for flavour/aroma. I'm not sure what the cost is for doing all-grain brewing but when you get to that point you'll not really care about the cost.
My mother has made several white wines from kits and they've been good, there are red wine sets available too. The people at your local homebrew shop should be able to give you a good recommendation on what'll be up your alley.

I have chronic pelvic pain, which is aggravated by IBS and horrific monthly periods, and my experience of the NHS is that they have a very 'get better or go die' mentality. If you can't be put neatly into a checkbox (i.e - pain is caused by cysts/tumor etc) then you're basically forgotten about. Don't get me wrong, I don't want a cyst or tumor, but I *would* like to know what the fuck is wrong with me and why I can't stand up for more than 15 minutes on a bad day. I exist on codienes and morphene and the pain has stopped me from getting a job and reduced my quality of life to the point where I spend most of my time thinking about walking in front of a bus.  

I typed up a load of advice then realised it pretty much repeated what others have already said - change GP, change consultant, look into making a complaint. The only other thing I would say is that you need to really fight your corner, because nobody else will do it for you. To your doctors, you're only patient 10 of 100 they have to see that day, and the challenge is to make them understand the affect pain has on your life - like giving up work for example. If you have a partner/ family member who can come with you to the appointment, that might help as well, because having someone healthy corroborate your experiences might push the doctor away from thinking you're just making it up to get pills.

You'll find that in 2012 the number of sales needed to get to number 1 are probably less than was needed to actually manage to get to number 40 in the 80's.

Although apparently I use too much internet so I may have to upgrade to the £12 goodbag. I've been better this month but I've had to watch my usage.

This also gives you £10 credit, which gets used up when you phone abroad, 0845 numbers etc. I'm a little confused where that comes from, but £10 only gets debited each month, so I'm essentially going with the it's part of the deal.

I honestly don't know if you need to top up each month - but I think it's probably the case.

true,the_nell_87,uk,Scot in London,"That's a common fallacy - that without piracy, the only way for anyone to get any media would be to buy it, and thus more money gets spent. That ignores the fact that sharing creates a lot of buzz. People sharing and discussing media creates a lot of interest and buzz, and interest and buzz causes people to buy. Recent studies have shown that people who pirate music actually spend MORE money on music than people who don't pirate. All the creative industries are booming right now, yet piracy is still around.

Also, an illegal download does not equal me stealing something, or taking something I haven't paid for. I have a huge CD collection from the last couple of decades. If I want to listen to an album which I already own, or put the music on my mp3 player, it would be quicker and easier to search and download it on TPB than it is to hunt out the CD and rip it onto my PC.

Child porn is of course the obvious argument, the ""nobody could object to censoring this"", ""for the children!"" argument. Yet censoring it has only caused the problem to get worse. It doesn't stop child porn from existing, it simply pushed those who make and distribute it further underground and much harder to catch.

Censorship does not work. If the creative industries want less people to illegally download, it's all about the business models. These days, I don't pirate music or games any more, because the business models in those industries (spotify, youtube, steam, etc) outweigh the need. I don't pirate comics or ebooks, because the digital marketplace is both reasonably priced and accessible in the way that I want it. I don't pirate movies, because I hate going to the cinema, and the business model is so bad that by the time it's available in decent quality (legally or not), my enthusiasm for it has more often than not vanished. I do pirate TV shows, and that's again due to the bad business model of airing shows in the USA, then taking weeks or months to air them over here. Yet I still subscribe to as much as I am able to. Censorship won't stop piracy, but evolution will.",0,1355237537,null,0,false,0,c7et659,t3_14lq1t,t1_c7et659,t1_c7eslsk,null,1430642474,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,abegosum,mcgann,McGann,"Arguably, it didn't.  We barely knew the ""scrooge"" of the story when it began and Eleven left the ""present"" before his personality could feasibly be determined.  While we saw the changes happening to his character in real time, no part of the established events we saw contradicted the possibility of him having a softer side.  Further, if he did, simply being reminded of that wonderful time when he was younger would certainly be a good way to bring it out.

On another note- it seems to me that this doctor walks an **extremely** fine line when it comes to this rule.  I took that as a result of character development.  Ten lost his best friend (which isn't his first tragic loss by far) in a very cruel way- her existence (as he knew her) was erased.  It was as if she never even existed.  In ""The Waters of Mars,"" we saw him throw his knowledge of the timeline out for selfish gain when he saved the astronauts.  His horror at the massive changes he made (and perhaps how close he came to unraveling reality by screwing with a nearly fixed-point) made him step back slightly.  Then, just before his own tragic and painful death, he witnessed the last other time lord die saving his life (despite being one of his fiercest enemies) and had to once again choose to lose all of Galifrey for the safety of the rest of the universe.

Smith's doctor is noticeably darker, fiercer, and less forgiving.  Once again, despite losing all of Galifrey, his oldest enemies, the Daleks, survive.  Even more recently, he lost Amy forever due to the rules of time travel.  

He raged against River Song for breaking a fixed point because he knows it's the line he's never allowed to cross.  Even a lord of all time has that limit- the events he has no choice but to accept.  

So, I think Eleven walks as close to the fire as he can- his act of defiance.  This universe isn't fair even to him, and his resentment is expressed in bending those rules as much and as often as he can.",0,1355239882,null,0,false,0,c7etp85,t3_14nghm,t1_c7etp85,t1_c7etaej,null,1430642729,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

true,le_butthurt,null,null,"The thinking is as follows:

* Population is perpetuated through reproduction.
* Society is built on taboos (societal norms).
* Children are born, raised, and educated on societal norms within the family unit.
* Therefore the family unit is essential to the continuation of society (demographically and culturally).
* In tribal societies, domestic groups are large and solidarity is mechanical. The bounds of family are wide, resources are shared through the community.
* In post-tribal societies (feudal structures and onwards), domestic groups are smaller and solidarity is organic (as in organs within a body, not organic as in morphing and growing). Social structure is based more on contracts than status. The bounds of family are narrow and resources stay within family groups.
* As families shrink and societies grow, kin relationships dilute. Marriage as a formal contract serves as a means of bonding couples together in the interest of the family unit and by extension society.
* Where marriage is upheld as an important institution, fertility rates are (supposedly) higher (this being important because fertility at or above replacement value (2) ensures societal continuation and an expanding economy). The family unit is naturally strengthened and by consequence the continuation of society and its norms (culture). Therefore, it (allegedly) makes sense to uphold marriage.
* Given that an aspect of marriage has been reproduction since time immemorial (evidenced by focus on events such as consummation of the marriage and the practice of chastity), same sex marriage obviously removes the association with reproduction.
* If this link is broken then marriage will be seen as superfluous and unnecessary. [It already is seen this way, IMHO.] People will marry less.
* Why is that a problem? If marriage incidence goes down, reproduction goes down (resulting in ageing populations, inverted intergenerational contracts, widespread economic pandemonium), the family unit is weakened, preservation of culture goes down, blurred family lines result in weakened solidarity, and society eventually begins to fracture. [This is highly debated, and almost entirely dismissed. I've met one professor who thinks that that process is under way. She was remarkably intelligent.

true,abegosum,mcgann,McGann,"Huge upvote for ""OH SHIT, IT'S THE TIME DRAGONS AGAIN!""

This is a weaker defense; but, just to play devil's advocate: I always assumed that the damage to time in the episode with Rose was a result of a directly reinforced paradox- the only reason they landed at that point in space and time was to witness Pete's death.  Remove Pete's death as a result of landing at that space in time, you remove the initial impetus for them being there at all.  

In the Scrooge ep, he went back in time to remind someone of the good in him.  The fact that the good was already there is the difference.  He didn't so much change the future as show events that could have already been established and buried under anger and hate.  I think that's why the freezer lady (yes, that's what I'm calling her) met a tragic end- something still had to make Scrooge curmudgeonly.  If not, the trip to the past removes the original impetus for the trip, and we have time dragons again.  

Since the doctor has established in the past that he sees time differently than us, I assume that he can see the difference between a direct paradox and a simple change, even if he's still blindsided by the intricacies result (ie- ""Whoa, you're angry also because you lost a love that I caused you to lose. Grizzled by thine own hand..."").  

The doctor has said that he's one of the few people who can know when it's safe or not to change the past (River seems to be able to as well, but I chalk that up to Time Lord DNA).  The assumption there is that he perceives time in a way the audience can't comprehend.  It's creates a need for belief suspension, and especially the way Moffat writes, it can be taxing.

If they don't want to perform ceremonies, they cannot be forced to legally. This was the position of every party arguing for it, including Labour. No one wants religions to be forced to perform marriages against their tennets

The law specifically regarding the CoE is only there because, as an established church, CoE rules are partially enacted in law. This is the same with female bishops: its not just against church rules to have women bishops, its enacted in statue. The moment the general synod vote for the change, parliament passes the change as a technicality.

true,XtremeGoose,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"You're being ridiculous. You think culture is something static, that never changes? Whilst some traditions remain culture is dynamic and develops. Where did roman culture come from? It was mostly imported from their conquests (such as Greece) and certainly changed a lot throughout time. And the same is true of western countries today.

I've lived in London the majority of my life and despite all the different ethnic influences it still has its own identity, it is still vastly different from, say, New York, despite both cities having huge immigrant and ethnically diverse populations. 

Diversity is good yes, and yes we are mixing cultures, but the new cultures formed will all have their own identity, and will all be traceable to their roots. Going back to my earlier example, roman culture is dead, but you can still see its influences all around Europe and North Africa. 

Diversity is interesting, but change is far more interesting. We're seeing new cultures develop, how can that not excite someone who claims that 'human cultures ... are beautiful things.' 

Multiculturalism is one of the best things to happen to the world, and you won't be able to stop it, no one will, and by the end of the 21st century, people will look back and laugh at those of you who hold your views, because in hindsight, they will appreciate that nothing has been lost, and everything has been gained. People will also appreciate, because they grew up in multi-cultural backgrounds, that it doesn't matter where you come from, you can choose your way of life, you are not born into it.

It is fairly obvious that those taking the call would be in serious trouble at work, particularly in this case given the hospitals ""royal"" reputation.

Yes and no. Normally you do not prank people you know nothing about it. When you do you get permission afterwards. They could not foresee it but they did absolutely nothing to mitigate the risk in the ways that most other pranksters do. 

&gt; and clearly feel a great deal of remorse and regret for their actions

Normally that only affects sentencing, not actual guilt. Not that I'm saying a prosecution is warranted here, they have been ""punished"" enough already via the global hate campaign against them.

I'm not saying people outside the city aren't loyal, as they clearly can be. I don't know why you're making it a local vs non local argument. You get loyal fans from both sides, and un-loyal fans from both sides. It's not a competition. 


 Where did I say I don't value non local fans? 

If you can find any fans more loyal than the spirit of shankly group, or the Hillsborough support group outside of the city I will be amazed. 
You've don't realise that the only reason we have fans out of the city is because we were very successful years ago, so for people without a local team it was the obvious choice to follow. Glory hunters.

true,Sorac,lfc99,,"I visited the UK when I was 13. I went for one reason, to visit Wales and all of its glorious castles. We eventually made our way up to Conwy in northern Wales and I thought I'd never visit a more magical place. It was the last ""major"" castle of my UK trip so when we left I wasn't feeling so optimistic of the rest of our trip (what a spoiled brat I was...). But then we went to Liverpool... and I fell in love. Not with LFC, not yet, but with the city. It felt like home. There's no other way to describe the feeling I had but of ""home."" 7 years later I still long to move to the UK but it may never happen :/ It wasn't until March of this present year that I even started to really follow soccer and the EPL. Once I started watching it regularly I realized I had no team to support. So I ""shopped around"" for a team to support. Then one day I'm watching a game, I wasn't even conscious of who was really playing. All I remember was a quick cut of the cameras from the pitch to a fan with his arms crossed. On the back of his forearm read, ""YNWA."" I had no idea what this meant at the time, I knew nothing about LFC. This seemingly small and insignificant acronym changed my life. I asked my friend who knows everything about everything in sports and he told me it was Liverpool's anthem, ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" Just the four words themselves give me shivers but when I realized a fan permanently engraved those words on his body, the floodgates opened for a passion I never thought I'd ever feel about a sports team. I immediately engrossed myself in everything Liverpool Football Club. Started waking myself up at 5 in the morning west coast time just to watch a game at the tail end of a losing season. The first game I really remember watching was the 2012 FA Cup Final against Chelsea. After watching more and more games I realized that Liverpool was rich in amazing history. I remember hearing for the first time, the anthem being sung by the supporters before a game; it gave me chills. I learned about the Kop  and wished that one day if only once I could stand in the Kop and sing YNWA. Late season was probably the worst time to start following the greatest team in soccer. All throughout the summer all I wanted to do was watch LFC.

 As far as this season goes there hasn't really been a specific ""best memory,"" all I can think of is waking up early in the morning, or skipping a midday class, to anxiously watch each one of Liverpool's games on literally the edge of my seat, constantly standing up, pacing, sitting back down on a different seat again and again for 90+ minutes. I still can't believe how invested and a part of this team I feel. 

I guess why I really want a shirt is not because of Torres, who was and I believe still is(or at least can be) a great player, but because I don't own any Liverpool gear.

Did you even bother to check her posting history, sporadic though that is? I just have and she clearly isn't what one would normally consider a troll. You can usually tell them pretty quickly by the fact the majority of their posts are voted on or below zero, which hers aren't. And a quick scan over her other posts' content doesn't show her to be particularly argumentative or contradictory, like trolls usually are. So I say again, it is just too easy to be nasty about a person's intent without at least asking them to explain it first.

^\* I say 'arguably improbable' there because I believe there is *some* possibility of there being a reasonable explanation for most of the remarks she described. Certainly 'Paki' and 'nigger' are used commonly enough in this country for them to be overheard several times. 'Abo' is entirely explicable too, as there are a large number of Australians doing bar-work and/or attending colleges in this country – and to an American's ear I daresay it's easy to mistake Aussie accents for British. I'll grant you that disparaging Mongolians seems a bit obscure, but there are said to be between 5-7 thousand in Greater London alone, so it's certainly not impossible. 'Darkie' may be extremely uncommon amongst the age group she's described, but it only takes one person to say something like that repeatedly for it to strike an outsider as a common pejorative. I do know a few people of that age who sound more like their parents than their peers, and as I say, it would only take one of them to be doing that. The point is, just because something is improbable it doesn't make it impossible. As any mathematician will tell you: improbable things happen all the time. 

As for your insistence that the people in that group just wouldn't talk like that: well I believe you're projecting your own narrow experience onto an entire class of people. You weren't there so you can't possibly know what they were like. That's not so unusual, one of my sisters does exactly the same thing all the time, but *she* hasn't experienced what I have... In the course of my work I have travelled the length and breadth of Britain and Ireland and I've met just about every kind of person there is – I've even rubbed shoulders with nobility! – and I have been continually amazed at just how casually racist so many of them are. I think they saw me as a white, working-class fellow who would ""understand"" where they were coming from, so to speak.

I'm fairly convinced they breached the UK Data Protection Act by broadcasting the private information (though whether that has any relevance in Australia, I doubt). They'd have been wise to hang up as soon as they realised they were being taken seriously, and I'm fairly amazed it got past the station's lawyers. 

I know it wasn't broadcast live, but what if the nurse had said ""oh, I'm so sorry ma'am, but she had a miscarriage during the night""?

Phoning up a *hospital* and trying to obtain private and confidential information about someone's medical condition is a pretty despicable thing to do, in my opinion, no matter how absurd the scenario, and how unlikely they thought it that they'd be taken seriously. I'm certainly not suggesting they should be hung, drawn, and quartered - the British press has responded with typical hypocrisy and hysteria - but I don't think what they did should be acceptable broadcast material. I just don't understand what's remotely amusing about it. Would they be cool with someone phoning up their doctor, pretending to be a relation of theirs, and getting information about their health status? Or perhaps their bank to obtain their financial records? Or perhaps the health or education records of their children would be fair game? Some things should just be off limits, I think.

When I came in, the floor was shaking from a huge crowd jumping up and down singing the Torres tribute. Many other songs followed, none of which I knew, save YNWA...it was unbelievable. I was so fired up for the game, and had learned a few tunes to sing along with the Kop that afternoon.

I've scouted many soccer pubs here in California, and there are some fun ones...but I can't imagine anything will ever compare to the experience I had in Liverpool...for a pre-season friendly...where we lost...

Just because the hospital didn't deem them worthy of a response doesn't mean they didn't care. One reason why not is because they broadcast private and confidential health information, the unauthorised sharing of which is against the law in the UK. 

Also, isn't that a bit like saying ""well, you left your car unlocked, which appeared to me to suggest you didn't care, so why wouldn't I take it?""?

Another reason they shouldn't have broadcast may be precisely because they didn't get permission - it seems from some sources that permission is key under Australian law, and that they didn't obtain it leaves them open to sanction.

true,wisepanther,null,null,"&gt;“No religious organisation or INDIVIDUAL minister being compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises” (BBC; emphasis added).

Unfortunately this “lock” could mean that within religions it will become “legal to deny or terminate employment on the basis of support for marriage equality, but not for opposition to it” (see embrownbill). This is already proposed by the Scottish government. In short, religions which are not homophobic will not be allowed to sack celebrants who are homophobic. Religions which are homophobic will still be allowed to sack celebrants who are not homophobic. What double standards!  

Allowing religious organisations to determine whether their employees preside over same-sex marriage is necessitated by freedom of religion. Therefore, any religion which wants to “compel” their celebrants to conduct same-sex marriage, by sacking those refusing to conduct same-sex marriages, should be allowed to do so. If, for example, the Roman Catholic Church is allowed to sack the celebrants they employ who do not share their beliefs on marriage then why should religions such as Liberal Judaism, Unitarianism, and Methodism not also be allowed to sack the celebrants they employ who do not share their beliefs on marriage?

But it seems this is a topic that comes up regularly - I've personally seen six / seven threads all in a similar vein this year.

Hell one person even went so far to create /r/crumpets/ though it seems to have died on its arse; and it's creator has dissociated him or herself from it.

Media manipulation is nothing new. It's just easier to spot, in a world where most people walk around with a device semi-permanently attached to their ear that facilitates access to more sources of information than has ever existed in human history, prior to this point.

The problem of course, is that whilst we're technologically advanced, we're information dumb. More and more people, sadly, will read a headline and automatically assume it's true - take the Daily Mail and their crusades against whatever has got their knickers in a twist this today [*goes and looks*]: 

**""'British whites' are the minority in London for the first time as census shows number of UK immigrants has jumped by 3million in 10 years""**

Now even without reading the article, that's clearly a bullshit headline. Because whilst ""British Whites"" might account for less than 50% of the London populous, there's no way on Earth there's a different group of people that's higher - ""British Whites"" still account for the highest percentage of folks in London, as a collective group, than any other.

But that's beside the point - I'd be interested in reading what your solution would be - banning links to articles from various sites just seems silly, and smacks of self-censorship.",0,1355250501,null,0,false,0,c7ewrg9,t3_14o962,t1_c7ewrg9,t3_14o962,null,1430644228,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Mr_Tiggywinkle,lfc99,,"I'm an Australian German. I follow Liverpool religiously.

I have no ties to anywhere in England, I simply follow them because a friend did a while ago, so when I got into the Premier League again, I just went ""screw it, I'll support Liverpool"", and I've stayed that way.

Hell, when I was a kid, I ""Supported"" Manchester United, because I had a football with their crest on it. (I've played football all my life, just never supported a team, as before the A-league, there really wasn't any good football worth watching in Australia). But that was scuppered when Bayern Munich lost to them in the Champions League Grand Final, and after a bit of Taunting from a Man U fan (I always hated that bastard...), I decided I didn't much like Man U anymore.

I've also always supported Bayern Munich as the German Side of my Family is based in Munich, and up here it's either 1860 or Bayern Munich.

So when I started being able to watch Premier League games (no easy task in an Australian Time Zone), I chose Liverpool.

Fast Forward to nowadays, I watch Liverpool religiously, and I just saw my first Premier League game at Upton Park, wedged between two hardcore West Ham fans that nearly throttled me when I jumped up and celebrated when shelvey ""scored"". (Highlight of the match was when Sterling was Kicked in the chest and the crowd around me started calling the Ref a moron and Sterling a diving cheat).

My Love for Liverpool started only from a choice based on nothing but a few factors, and I wouldn't dare say It's as strong as a scouser who has breathed LFC their whole life, but certainly despite a crude beginning, I would challenge anyone who says I'm some kind of bandwagoner.",0,1355251781,null,0,false,0,c7ex6ac,t3_14mvxi,t1_c7ex6ac,t3_14mvxi,null,1430644514,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

So this legislation removes the right of individual churches and congregations to choose, as the ABW says. And anyway, who would want to be married by someone who condemned their relationship?

No, I don't know for sure if it's illegal in Australia. However, a company I used to work for provided a health information system to hospitals there and they certainly took data security and confidentiality as seriously as in the UK, but I'm not aware of the specific regulatory requirements as I am in the UK. I'd be very surprised were it legal to publicly broadcast information about someone's health without their consent though, but that's just my guess.

Did they broadcast information that wasn't already in the public domain? Unquestionably so, yes. The hospital gave out specific information on her condition and how she'd been during the night, apparently (and incredibly) believing they were talking to a family member, which the station then broadcast.

&gt;Because they were acting as employees of the hospital and not as individuals.

I'm not sure whether the law in Australia distinguishes between whether they need permission from the hospital or the specific individuals. I've read a couple of articles in the papers in Australia suggesting that they need the specific permission of the individuals concerned. If that is the case, I expect the station will be sanctioned. However, the fact that the lawyers passed it would suggest otherwise, and as I say, I don't really know anything other than the suggestions in the papers there that they should've sought the nurses specific permission.

&gt;If sharing of confidential health information is illegal in this country, perhaps the staff are also liable to prosecution

I've some experience in the area, and I'd imagine they're absolutely open to both disciplinary proceedings under their employment contracts, and potentially prosecution under the Data Protection Act, though I think it highly unlikely, particularly given one of them is now tragically dead, and the fact that the Palace have said they've no wish to pursue the matter and don't hold the hospital responsible (somewhat bizarrely, in my opinion, but it's no doubt informed by the fact that someone's died).",0,1355253415,null,0,false,0,c7expng,t3_14mczu,t1_c7expng,t1_c7ewz2z,null,1430644764,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Bear_Sheba,cnty-england,Alhamdulillah!,"&gt;who supports widespread freely available drugs.

I don't think you understand what it is that I am advocating. Perhaps thats because I haven't explained it adequately. The drugs are already widespread and freely available, I know this, I can have any type of drug delivered to my door if I wanted to. What I am saying is that the government should recognise the problem, that is, addiction, and take *useful and proactive* steps towards dealing with it rather than punishing (what I would consider to be) the victims of drugs.

I don't think that a free-for-all system of drugs available to anyone should it take their fancy is the answer. This may work with marijuana, as has been experimented with (to a notable degree of success, in my opinion) in Portugal, the Netherlands and increasingly South America. I would support total legalisation of marijuana, but I see that as a different discussion to enforcement of harder drugs.

What I advocate, is an NHS operated system of clinics, that *existing* heroin users could attend. They *would* get free heroin, paid for by the taxpayer - and I understand why this would be massively unpopular, as it would appear that the government was advocating heroin use or funding habits from tax money. In terms of costs, I think that these would be recovered by the money saved in policing. In terms of ethics, the NHS already provides opioid substitute drugs such as methadone to help users of heroin, and in prisons, genuine heroin for addicts when it would be deemed dangerous for them to quit immediately. 

These clinics would have several effects:

- They would severely starve organised crime of the lucrative import/export &amp; distribution business in the UK. (This includes reducing demand from Taliban affiliated producers in Afghanistan, as a side note).

- They remove the massive financial burden of addiction, that contributes towards the crimes of acquisition that colour our perception of serious addiction.

- They would allow a safe environment for users, reducing the health risks such as HIV spread and badly cut drugs.

- They would provide an opportunity for medical professionals to properly study, record reliable data and most importantly treat addiction.

- They would contribute towards a change to the overwhelming public perception of addiction as a moral defect, perhaps even restoring an element of self-esteem to people who are considered and often consider themselves, an underclass.

The status quo is not doing any of these things with any sort of real success. The statistics may show a slight increase or decrease in usage, but the problem persists and decades of unchanging policy have yielded little in the way of a solution.

As for my personal experience, a childhood friend of mine died from an overdose in 2009, my best friend from university was born to a heroin addict and suffered birth defects as a result, and I have recently overcome an addiction to amphetamines (no-where near the level of severity as heroin, I must add).

For **private accommodation**, try Craigslist/Gumtree...or the University has adds up in the unions.  If you want to get into **halls**, then the university has spaces for visiting students - try the [uni accommodation services website](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/accommodation-services/new-prospective/visiting-exchange).

Edinburgh's super safe.  There were a couple of attacks on the Meadows earlier in the year but I doubt you'll have any trouble.

**Running** - lots of people go around Holyrood Park / Arthur's seat. [Here](http://www.walkjogrun.net/running-routes/UK/City%20of%20Edinburgh/Edinburgh/) is a website with running routes around the city.  

For **swimming**, there's the commonwealth pool -which is olympic sized and has recently been refurbished.  There are other smaller council pools.  If you can wangle it, I reckon the [university's pool](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/sport-exercise/sports-centre/sports-activities/swimming/swimming-facilities) might be the cheapest option, if somewhat remote from Little France.  

**Cycling** - I think people go up and down the union canal, not really sure.

**Pints** - depends what atmosphere you want - old man real ale pubs like [Cloisters](http://www.list.co.uk/place/102899-the-cloisters/) or the [Cask and Barrel](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/cask-and-barrel-southside-edinburgh), if you want live music then [The Jazz Bar](http://www.thejazzbar.co.uk/) or [Whistle Binkies](http://www.whistlebinkies.com/), if a fancy bar then [Cafe Royal](http://www.caferoyal.org.uk/) or most places on George St.  For getting wasted then head to the Grassmarket or the unions.  There are lots of bars, mostly open til 1am.  Clubs are open til 3.

true,stent_removal,lfc87,,"How can I say this... I'm from America, my high school soccer (sorry, football) team adopted Liverpool's phrase as our own: ""You'll never walk alone.""

I loved my high school team. I loved soccer (sorry, football) but never followed it. So when in 2006 my family finally subscribed to Fox Soccer Channel... It felt like fate when the first thing I recall watching were highlights from the 2005 champion's league final. Then the next thing was... the 2006 FA cup final.

I was literally glued to the edge of the seat, staring at the TV, and for whatever reason, I found myself rooting as hard as I could for Liverpool. Maybe it's just my preference for the underdog, or maybe it was the phrase my high school team had so ungraciously adopted that stirred something up in me. They went down, and I grew frustrated. Then Gerrard's strike -- 3-3 in the last minute -- I blew up. I was screaming at the TV, jumping up and down and pumping my fists, all by myself in an empty house.

Now I find myself waking up at ungodly hours to catch a game, and on matchdays, my mood for the rest of the day is pretty much dependent on whether or not we've won.

I'm afraid I'll never have known the glory at Istanbul, I've never smelled or heard the air at Anfield, but well, I consider myself a genuine fan. I could have chosen any team in the world, a team that might have walked into a match against West Ham and come out 5-0 on top with no surprise, but the grit and determination from that match was something special, something different altogether.

So, well, it seems like the fact that I developed a passion for LFC after that 2006 final might classify me into the ""bandwagon fan"" category, but then I say, ""Fuck you, I'm never ever hopping off. Ever. I'm having my child on this bandwagon and he'll be a red for the rest of his life, too.""

I watched Liverpool play Chelsea with an American LFC fan once. His comments were more typical of a neutral supporter (""Good goal, Drogba's really good"" - Yes, of course he's fkin good, but he plays for Chelsea, so for the next 90 minutes we want him to die in car crash!). It made me not take him seriously due to his comments, not his nationality.

For my part, I'm of a generation where all my childhood friends were ManU-supporters because of the Scholes / Giggs / etc generation of the 90s. I was the ONLY Liverpool supporter, and had to endure no end of abuse. 

I get that living in Liverpool is something different. But if you tell me you don't take me seriously as a Liverpool fan, I'm afraid I'll have to stab you in the nuts. Or we could do a trivia face off. Either way.

true,irotsoma,smith,Smith,"Yeah, all the rest of the stuff is a pretty standard mini-ITX setup.  In fact I'm not sure why it's so expensive.  Even considering a custom case it seems kinda pricey:


On Amazon the parts are about:

* MB: ~$80

* CPU: ~$100

* Memory: ~$50

* HD: ~$60

* PSU (not available on Amazon but on their site it's): ~$60

* BR Writer (just says sony br writer, so a conservative number is): ~$100

* Windows 7 (assuming an OEM license): ~$100


So the parts alone (not including volume discounts that they likely get, are about $550 before taxes.  Let's assume a generous $50 in labor to assemble just to get an even number and we have about $600 max for parts and labor outside of the cost of the case.  Let's assume an extra 25% profit margin even though I'm using retail prices on the parts and that brings the price to about $750 for everything outside of the case.


They list the pre-VAT price at £780.99 ~= $1,260. So basically they are valuing the cost of the case at a minimum of $500 and I'm being extremely generous on the parts and labor cost and profit margins, so it's likely a couple of hundred more at least.  

So not sure the case is worth what they value it at, but I might be willing to spend $300.

true,WhyIsBiscuitTaken,lfcwfmm,,"Hmm, I'm going to be honest here mate. I've always been a huge fan of Torres. For example, I watched Euro 2008 and was rooting for Spain every game, and just seeing Torres move was magic for me. When he scored the only goal against Germany in the final I was out of my chair screaming.

I give you that information because it was in the interview after the game that Torres stated that he thought that LFC could go all the way that year and win the EPL. Due to not really having internet at my home or cable (watched Euro '08 at a friends house), I never had been able to watch any EPL games so I never really had a team. Torres let me find LFC.

I knew that as I watched him produce artful performances with his feet that I would support this guy for the rest of his career, I also knew that because this player was such an amazing talent that his club would have to be good as well.

So I sidled down to my local library and typed ""Liverpool Football Club"" into google and eventually clicked on Wikipedia. I researched everything about LFC, from our beginnings to our more recent wins, and I researched every manager that lead us to glory. I watched every DVD about LFC and read every book (at the time). I fell in love with LFC and decided that this was the team for me. I haven't looked back since.

One of my favorite memories was this goal: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZL9E8SCxlI 
Seeing the crowd react and the way Torres celebrated really cemented my belief that LFC is the best football club in the world.

It honestly broke my heart when Torres left for Chelsea, I was destroyed for days afterwards. So, I would like these shirts as a thank you to Torres for allowing me to find my home, my family. For though the storm was rough, there is just now beginning to be a golden sky.

TL;DR: I'd like the shirts please.",0,1355266954,null,0,false,0,c7f297p,t3_14lqdm,t1_c7f297p,t3_14lqdm,null,1430646905,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

A lot of depends on your GP. My first GP that I saw, was absolutely terrible. Refused to give any advice, told me to stick to paracetamol and do stretches daily. ?!! I did it anyway, to ensure I covered all possibilities.

After 3 years of sticking with that surgery, not having a single prescription from them, I finally changed. The new surgery is a bit further away, but I was happy to make the change if the surgery was good.

They were. My GP put me on 30/500 co-codamol tablets (codeine and paracetamol), and suggested I combine with this ibuprofen, and in the mean time they will refer me to a MATS clinic.

I was skeptical, but finally I got some relief, because like you, I was swallowing whatever I could from OTC just in the hope of some kind of pain relief. All the opiods aren't great at long term pain management but the way I saw it, I just wanted relief short term and wanted to think long term later.

I had my MATS appointment a few weeks ago and have now gone down to 15/500 co-codamol tablets and Gabapentin.

I really do sympathise with you.

I don't think the NHS is entirely to blame, I think it's a combination. Symptoms like these are so hard to pinpoint, and most often require other specialists to get a true diagnosis together. Combine that with a lot of doctors are skeptical anyway, plus the fact that prescribing any stronger painkillers seem to be a criminal offence these days (it seems as though some doctors are shit scared to do it), it's difficult. Really really difficult.

Is there any new surgeries you could go to?

It seems mostly about the enforcement of property boundaries and very similar to corporate partnerships.

It's not just government though I feel. Newspapers, especially those like the Guardian or the BBC have to legitimise their superficial liberal brand, and social issues like these fill that need. Talking points are so tightly controlled, it can never really be anti-war, anti-capitalist, or anything anti central political extremism. 

It also has the leverage of being beneficial to all political parties: the conservatives can be against it highlighting ""traditional family values"" without changing socio-economics in any meaningful way, liberal sorts can be for. It's a simple issue that everyone can have an opinion about, compare that to arming Syrian ""rebels"" or the mechanics of the Bank of England.

Food is heavily tied to culture and immigration adds diversity to culture, but things like new business models and new ways of working come from emulating tactics used by successful companies.

My own take on this topic is that the CoE should be forced to conduct equal marriages, so long as they wish to remain the established church. For it to be otherwise (i.e. let the CoE off) the government is sanctioning discrimination - this is actually happening, given that they're planning on allowing other religious groups to perform equal marriage but not the CoE.

If the CoE is disestablished then the government won't have to force a religious group to do something they don't want to (even though they *do* enforce some equality legislation (racism, ageism) but not all (homosexuality, wrong religion)), which they shouldn't really.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; For instance they are legally required to provide marriages to any couples who ask for them at the moment.

Isn't that only for the local parish church?

Some friends of mine wanted to get married in their parish church earlier this year, which happens to be a rather swish one in Clifton, Bristol. In the end they went to another little church elsewhere, because they were mucked about by the big posh church. Of course they still had to attend a few months of services.

And that got me thinking. If a CoE church *must* provide a marriage, why is it they can put stipulations on it like ""Must attend 6 months of services""? They could just as easily state: ""Must have been coming here for 10 years.""

Also, with the big church, I wondered that might it be policy that the parish church mucks around a couple who don't regularly attend church and thus end up sending them to another not-their-local-parish church. This results in the couple having to attend for many months, thus upping the apparent church attendance?

Has anybody REALLY looked at him and stopped to consider that his time at Swansea may be on par with Cisse at Newcastle using a quick example? 

I feel that most people are being blinded by the light of his recent form..you should NEVER do that when looking for a player, you want consistency and Michu is one of the least consistent players ive seen

He's 26 going on 27 so no longer young, he already should have long found his shooting legs but Prior to Swansea his goal scoring record is pretty poor.. If you want to use the '*but he's now in great form and he'll keep it up and only get better*' line then let me remind you of last years wonder striker Cissé (who scored 13 in 14 games all amazing goals) this season has not only played more games than last season but has not scored a third of the goals he did last season..and he's a much more prolific and consistent performer than Michu is

Not to mention Swansea and pundits have now valued him at **25-30 MILLION** which I think is fucking incredible and very, very wrong after just one good season..

Llorente is exactly 1 year younger than Adebayor (to the day!), and in the prime of his career. He will want to move somewhere he can play consistently. Unless we're willing to shelve Adebayor or Defoe, we simply can't offer that to him.

He's a consistent goal scorer when he gets game time, at Chelsea a lot of time he may get 1 whole game every 2-5 games which isnt a lot to do anything in plus I get the vibe he doesnt want to be there being a glorified sub. He's young and BR knows how to get the best out of youngsters, he's fast and in this team we can certainly use that, he's fearless when it comes to shooting more importantly he's not afraid to shoot at goal, he's an up and coming England international who wants to come..it'd be nice for once to get a player in thats dead set on coming rather than persuaded ",0,1355283001,null,0,false,0,c7f710p,t3_14p56q,t1_c7f710p,t3_14p56q,null,1430649221,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

There was a bit of an issue as they were renovating the TARDIS for The Doctor's Wife. They actually destroyed the set after that because they weren't actually supposed to have kept it in the first place.

One of the things about Doctor Who is that the TARDIS interior is meant as a massive *investment*. It's a huge cost and things like how long you'll be using it need to be hammer out through contracts (which can later be renewed).

One of the stipulations of stage-space usage was that once you developed a new interior the previous one was to be torn down for a new set (not necessarily a new TARDIS set, but a new set in general).

As it turns out, nobody really cared much about this and was content to let the Tenth Doctor's TARDIS sit until it absolutely *had* to be used.

When Gaiman wrote his script he was delighted to hear they still had the set, but once they filmed their scenes that set did have to be torn down.

Key components of the interior were kept in storage).",0,1355283253,null,0,false,0,c7f73tf,t3_14osw0,t1_c7f73tf,t1_c7f6wy8,null,1430649259,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I'm not at all opposed to Sturridge myself, just turned off a little by the price tag. He has the potential to make it look like a bargain, but could very well end up being overpriced (though not anywhere near as badly as some of our other recent buys). In addition to your point about him being a consistent goalscorer when given the chance, I'd add that it's worth taking a look at his strengths and weaknesses. His passing's okay, he's direct and is a pretty good finisher, he's effective in the air, young and can play across the front-three. All sound good, and his finishing, strength and decent heading ability are things we could use up front. 

His disadvantages are that he's been struggling with a hamstring injury (not ideal, but hopefully not something that'll plague him), he's cup-tied in Europe (again, annoying but not a problem in the long-term). The main criticism of him at Chelsea seems to be that he's selfish, but if you're a young player and you don't get many opportunities to play, you're *going* to be.

true,BritishHobo,null,null,"&gt;only 3 of them were original material

That's not completely true. I was ready to give up on the US remake after the club episode (episode 3, I think) because they had basically done nothing new. But there were so many fresh ideas from episode 4 onwards that I fell in love with it almost instantly.

I don't think it's at all fair to simply claim that there's only three original scripts. There are multiple episodes which take the basic plot of the original and go in a wildly different direction - the Charlotte Hinchcliffe episode was almost entirely different, as was the school trip episode (with a great Civil War re-enactment storyline). They both took the very basic ideas (Will likes Charlotte, and them being on a school trip) and based entirely new storylines off of them. On top of that there was multiple original episodes (the spa, the country club, the Red Bull library episode, Will stopping a fire and becoming known as a hero), and some new ongoing storylines - Neil's dad's 'friend' Johno (who was great), Jay's younger girlfriend (and Simon's brother being a love rival - their changing the year seven party from the work experience episode into one where the group go to a party that turns out Simon's brother is holding was a really great one), and an expanded role for the girl from the school trip episode.

It makes me sad that it's been cancelled and is going to be forever known as 'yet another failed US remake'. As with The Office, it settled into its own groove after a few identical-to-the-original episodes, and the characters completely came into their own. The writing was pretty sharp, and the four leads were very funny in their own way. Given enough time, I think it would have followed even more in the steps of The Office and become its own thing entirely. It's interesting to me that the most reviled US remakes are the ones that were only a pilot or a few episodes - I feel like if they had gotten longer runs, they would have gotten a chance to be viewed like The US Office, on their own merits.",0,1355285371,null,0,false,0,c7f7rjw,t3_14lojr,t1_c7f7rjw,t1_c7ed55b,null,1430649567,1,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,1

However, as a definition of ""something one chooses"", did you choose your mother tongue, religion, how your hair naturally parts, pear shape, apple shape? Is marriage a choice? Marriage is certainly a choice. Obesity might be many thousands of extra choices.

Anyway, those all shape lifestyle. Style used to have meaning, but because of fashion and marketing it has been reduced to whimsical bullshit there to fool the latest generation that there is progress or that they are actually getting access to something new. Inuits have a style, hell, the burqa has style, those skinny jeans used to have style when they were worn by cyclists who didn't want clothing to get caught in wheels.

Thinking on a bit, gayness will probably be a choice if we ever get around to the genetic or environmental cause. I'll be presumptuous, and head off a denial of that possibility by throwing out the question, if not by genetics, and not by environmental causation, does that leave magic? [Insert joke about fairies...]

To answer your question traditionally: no, homosexuality isn't a choice. If I wanted to be more obtuse it might not even be a thing. There are just patterns of stimuli. I think by increments one could be trained to have a sexual response to anything, or apply enough frustration.

* *Bishops* - Sonic Screwdrivers (Third Doctor's for white and Eleventh Doctor's for black)

* *Knights* - UNIT officers

* *Rooks* - Time Lords (""The Deadly Assassin"" style)

**BLACK**

* *King* - Davros

I truly was star struck; I mean the things this man could do with a ball were baffling to me (especially with Gerrard working with him). Torres is truly what grabbed my attention so tightly and started my love for this amazing club. He started it all for me, and when I heard that he had left, it felt like a dagger through my side. To this day I still follow him very closely, I will never let Torres out of my eye.

**Piece Designation**

Black King - The Doctor

* Trouble always seems to find him even if he doesn't go looking for it. As the eternal pacifist, he rarely participates directly in fights. However, he almost always ends up alone, after sacrificing, or simply being left, by his companions.

White King - The Master

* The natural reflection of the Doctor, they are similiar in many ways despite being on different sides of the battlefield. As a schemer, the Master dislikes getting his hands dirty by engaging in combat directly. He'll also do anything and sacrifice anything to stay alive. When the Master faces the Doctor with no other pieces, the game ends in a stalemate.

Black Queen - The TARDIS

* The Tardis looks like a rook, but as the most powerful character, the Tardis is much more suited to being the Queen, the most powerful piece on the board. The Queen can move in any direction and trumps nearly every other piece in the game.

White Queen - Rassilon

* Powerful and deadly, the Time Lords are represented by Rassilon. Arguably the Doctor's most dangerous enemy, they were on the same side until the time war took a turn for the worse.

Black Rooks - Jack Harkness and River Song

* Both these characters are essentially reflections of the same archetype. Arguably the most competent and fight-capable companions in New!Who, they are appropriate substitutions for the second most powerful (after the Queen) pieces on the board, the rooks. 

White Rooks - Davros and The Dalek Emperor

* The two ""leaders"" of the Daleks are the clear choice for the dangerous rooks that oppose the Doctor's side. 

Black Bishops - Rose and Martha

* Interchangable with Amy and Donna as the Black Knights, the four supporting pieces represent the four major companions of New Who. 

White Bishops - 2x Cybermen

* The Rani and Omega briefly considered occupying this spot, but I decided to keep it all New Who. See General &gt; The Doctor's Enemies for more information.

Black Knights - Amy and Donna

* Interchangable with Rose and Martha as the Black Bishops, the four supporting pieces represent the four major companions of New Who.

White Knights - 2x Silents

* See General &gt; The Doctor's Enemies for more information.

Black Pawns - Supporting Companions/Allies - Mickey, Queen Victoria, Wilfred, Time Lady in EOT, Rory, Craig, The Ood, Kate Stewart

White Pawns - Enemy Soldiers - 2x Daleks, 2x Homo reptilians, 2x Weeping Angels, 2x Sontarans

**General**

Black and White Designation: We are traditionally wired to think that White = good and Black = bad. However, in Chess they are nothing but reflections of each other. The only thing that is different about them is that white always moves first, and I think this is nothing but fitting. White acts, and black reacts, such as the Doctor and his enemies.

The Doctor's Companions: The Doctors side is only companions because though he is a genius and he has his various gadgets and, of course, his TARDIS, the Doctor is nothing without his companions: they are his true strength. They keep him morally and emotionally tethered, they fight and die for him, and give him something to fight (and die, but also live) for in return. 

The Doctor's Enemies: In general the Doctor's enemies are more numerous than his companions and friends, so I represented this by making sure that two of every major enemy the Doctor faces is on the board, with Daleks being represented four times as the major recurring enemy of the series. They are then (approximately) ordered by how important or recurring they are in the in the series, with the true villains designated over species acting merely on instinct or on orders.

&gt; The legislation explicitly stating that it will be illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry same-sex couples and that Canon Law, which bans same-sex weddings, will continue to apply

So it's no longer discrimination to say ""no"" to gay couples? I'm sorry but we pussy-foot around religion way too much, and give it way more respect than it deserves. The church of England and Church in Wales, as well as Canon Law, are homophobic, discriminative, and living in the past. Why should their views be respected just because they're religious institutions?

- After Comolli was sacked, we didn't have a proper recruitment team put in place

- Rodgers was making a big step up from Swansea to Liverpool, meaning his knowledge of potential Liverpool-worthy targets would be limited to mostly Premier League players.

Those two factors combined meant we weren't going to have a sizeable pool of players from which to identify possible targets. I mean, look at the players we did sign: two former Swansea players in Allen and Borini, one player probably partially recommended by Mourinho in Sahin, one player who was apparently a Swansea target in Assaidi. 

That tiny pool of players shouldn't be a problem anymore, because we finally have a recruitment team, and Rodgers will have communicated to the scouting setup what he's after in terms of players and targets.

If you rent you don't have to make a large downpayment, which gives you a large chunk of capital that house owners don't have.

Depending on all these factors (housing price changes, value of long term investments, rental market vs mortgage etc etc) it's entirely possible that someone who rents a property over say 30 years and invests the savings and their lump sum could end up with more in savings than the value of the house at the end of those 30 years.  they could then buy the same house outright and have money to spare.

They're not necessarily immigrants. I think you're talking about minorities. If you want to discuss minorities that's a different debate. Have you got the stats? I mean black isn't a nationality, so how you're saying ""Almost every nationality other then British has a higher unemployment rate higher than natives"" and the saying ""blacks"" doesn't quite make sense to me.

Also, if you want to get into ethnicity and benefits, white british still comes out below Indian and Chinese. I mean if you're going to break it down into race AND gender, you can make a certain point about each demographic, but you said, ""Almost every nationality other then British has a higher unemployment rate higher than natives"".

So have you got the stats for any of those?

[As at February 2011, 16.6% of working age UK nationals were claiming a DWP working age benefit compared to 6.6% of working age non-UK nationals](http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/adhoc_analysis/2012/nat_nino_regs.pdf)

I don't think your general argument stands up. Foreign born nationals seem less likely to claim benefits from the most recent stats I've seen. I'd love to see it broken down by nationality if you can find it, I'm struggling to get them myself. Also, in regards to ethnicity of claimants, I don't see how that's relevant to the matter at hand, which is the number of foreign born residents.

So this kinda bothers me on a number of levels. Actual implications aside, there's a lot of just plain *terrible* numerical accuracy in representation going on in this article. To explain further, here's a simple explanation:

Based on this quote, we have a simple situation: x - 0.003 = 1.58

...but that isn't right, at all, if you've spent any amount of time studying statistics. If x is 1.586, say, then sure, if you take away 0.003 you'd get 1.583, which you could happily round down to 1.58, *but you wouldn't* because the relevant digit here is the last one; you'd be throwing away the precision for no reason. *Why remove the most interesting digit in that number?* The fact that our answer here is displayed the way it is suggests that x is only accurate to two decimal places, so we can only assume it's 1.59... but 1.59 - 0.003 =/= 1.58. So, we should assume the sum is right, in which case what we have here is a good example of very *bad* numerical representation. The important digit in 1.58 is the one following the 8, which has clearly been rounded up/down, and/or removed.

&gt;Employment rose 40,000 to 29.6 million, which was the highest figure since records began in 1971.

There it is again. If you're going to talk about 0.04 million, then an associated number needs to be given to the same numerical precision.

&gt;Employment in the public sector fell for the 12th consecutive month, dropping 24,000 to 5.7 million, which was outstripped by a 65,000 rise in private sector employment to 23.8 million.

You'll be directed to a provider - we've had people sent to twelve week I.T. training courses; those with I.T. skills are being directed to libraries. [A number of people we work with are on JSA, so we're having to get to grips with Universal Jobmatch and Universal Credit ourselves].

*Which of course are renowned for their secure I.T. facilities.*

Eventually I believe most larger job centres will also offer improved terminals that can access the new DB.

**Edit:** Forgot to add - if you're on the work programme, you'll be told to use their facilities. It's only if you've not already been referred to a third party welfare to work organisation that the above would happen.

&gt;Email is considered insecure because of the way it passes in plaintext through multiple servers on its way to its destination. That's why your GP isn't allowed to email you - they're not even allowed to reply to a request for a repeat prescription, in case hotmail accidentally delivers it to the wrong address.

I hope we bring in 3 players this window (at least 2).  Preferably, 2 attacking players (any 2 of another striker, a #9 or a winger) as well as one more defensive player.  Skrtel has been poor at times this season, I would rather we brought in someone else so Skrtel and Agger don't have to do all the work.  Preferably tall and strong who will add goals from set pieces (headers).

Come to think of it, we could really use another fullback (on either side).  Enrique is a revelation on the wing and Downing doesn't cut it for me.  And Johnson's failure to track back as much as he should will catch us out against the better teams.  He played brilliantly versus West Ham when going forward, but Allen kept having to cover for him defensively as he tried to get back.  Allen isn't a defender and we need him in the middle of the park to keep the tempo of our play and spray the ball out to other outlets with his accurate passing.  I would rather just bring in a new ~~LB~~ RB and let Johnson roam forwards more often.

• Ensure that no religious organisation or individual minister can be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises.

• Provide an opt-in system for religious organisation who wish to conduct marriages for same-sex couples.

• Amend the Equality Act 2010 to reflect that no discrimination claims can be brought against religious organisations or individual ministers for refusing to marry a same-sex couple.

• Ensure that legislation will not affect the canon law of the Church of England or the Church in Wales. As a result, if either church wanted to conduct a same-sex marriage, it would require a change to primary legislation at a later date and a change to canon law.

This is ENORMOUSLY greater than what allows churches to ban female priests/bishops. ENORMOUSLY. They basically get a line in the equality act for that. 

Yet it has never been successfully challenged, and never will be. And gender discrimination is something the ECHR are intense on.

 With gay marriage you have protections 4 times greater, on a cause that the ECHR has never shown its self to be very fond of (gay rights). 

In summary you have complete, unimpeachable, and irrevocable protection. Only the UK radically changing the law, then leaving the Council of Europe, and the European Union would make it possible. For reference every state in Europe, and Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and the only state ever to withdraw was Greece until a tyranical junta of generals in the 1960s.
