Their argument was that they weren't a ""chain of hotels"" and it was their private home. I think that argument is flawed and they are indeed a commercial business. But that's not the point. 

Commercial businesses are privately owned. Businesses should be able to discriminate how they like. Why? Well because of what has occurred, I and many other people would be sure to avoid this B&amp;B. There is simply no reason why boycotting cannot work for larger companies. People will cry out that there isn't enough competition to allow boycotting in this way. But surely that's a problem with the lack of competition. Surely we should be working to reduce the monopolies of companies like Tesco, rather than introducing anti-discriminatory laws to all businesses, big or small.

I would rather a company not allow gays on their premises so that through word-of-mouth I am aware that they do so. That way I can avoid them. These anti-discriminatory laws mean I may be frequenting, and thus giving money to, a business whose owners are bigots without knowing it.

Sure, he scores goals but there's always a high chance with him that he's going to be sent off. He just makes dangerous tackle after dangerous tackle. I love what he's done in the final third of the pitch, but he's just terrible in the middle third, which is confusing considering his position.

Also, Skrtel has been pretty bad this season. I'm beginning to think that Coates should be the starter ahead of him.

We do not need to go after Llorente. If we do, it'll be a waste of money for a Spanish, older Andy Carroll. I'm not saying Carroll is bad, but why dish out the money for Llorente when we could have had Andy?

Although I don't see it happening, our number one target in January should be Robert Lewandowski. There's tons of reasons why he won't want to join us but Rodgers talks a big game. I'm absolutely sure he can convince Lewa if given the opportunity. Lewandowski is the most complete striker I've seen since Torres.

&gt;At the very least you need one non-biased witness or corroborating evidence. 

They did, yet again it would seem you haven't even read what you're attempting to take issue with. Right back in my OP I said ""All this information was given to the police with **statements from adults who witnessed the confrontation** that they were willing to give evidence"".

&gt;Some CCTV footage of the kid on the bike would be a start, as it stands there isn't even any proof he was once in possession of it.

As the confrontation took place in front of a shop there could well be some CCTV footage, atleast there may have been back when this took place likely long since wiped. The point is that the police didn't even bother to try and find out.

No it's the whole point. This is after all a thread about ""Matthew Woods - A martyr to bad jokes"".

I disagree. It is the belief that all religions are wrong - a belief regarding religion is a religious belief. If atheism isn't a religious belief then what is it? A political belief or an artistic belief or a belief about which superhero is the best?

Atheism is a religious belief like '0' is a value and 'anarchy' is a political system.

A lack of religious beliefs better describes a lack of religious opinion (agnosticism) IMO.

The reports i've read say that they had monies amounting to £300,000 into their current account, and £100,000 into his account.

They bought 1 computer for an eye hospital, paid for some kids to go to school, and paid for an operation for one man's gangrenous leg.

Now, 1 computer isn't expensive. At all. The cost of putting kids through school in Africa is derisory at best, or at least it is in Sierra Leone where i have seen these things in operations. As for the surgery, i couldn't guess how much that will have cost, but i'm guessing it's not £300,000.

So, far from 'donating proceeds to Kenyan village', it seems that this couple have managed to generate £400,000 by living outside the law, and have done a few philanthropic things along the way.

These people on the other hand are living outside the law selling drugs which has been linked numerous times to criminality, and getting rich off of it. Giving away a fraction to people in Kenya doesn't make it right.

true,SockBramson,null,null,"I've tried to work this out. I think for there to be contuinity River has to have met 11, then 10 a few times, then 11 again, and then 10 for the last time.

Let's look at her story backwards chronologically.

* We know that the last time she is with the Doctor it is 10 in ""Silence In The Library/Forest Of The Dead""
* We know that the 2nd to last time she is with the Doctor it is 11 when he gives her the sonic at the Singing Towers. We know it's the 11th Doctor and not 10 because part of that is shown in that mini-episode ""Night And The Doctor"" (that would have been a perfect cameo spot for Tennant but...)
* The next time we see River is ""Time of Angels/Flesh And Stone."" In ""Silence In The Library"" River asks, ""Have we done Crash of the Byzantium?"" which is the ship from the Angels episode so obviously that happened before SITL/FOTD.

Now just because we know that 11 gives her the sonic in the mini-episode there is still room between ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Time of Angels"" for 10 to have had adventures with her. If you'll remember the mini-episodes explained that 11 stayed up at night and went on adventure with River.

In Tennant's special episodes ""The Next Doctor,"" ""Planet Of The Dead,"" &amp; ""Waters Of Mars"" that's basically what he's doing. ""End Of Time"" even opens with telling Ood Sigma about all the adventures he'd had. So to me it makes sense that he travelled with the late Professor River Song for awhile.

That would certainly make sense of the line, ""Judging by your face it's early."" (paraphrasing)

So, yeah. 10 had adventures with River Song after ""Journey's End"" but before ""End Of Time.""

By Scouts, and especially Explorer scouts, there's definitely been a shift in the paradigm of what Scouting's supposed to be, with a much bigger emphasis on bushcraft, activities, and skills. No spirituality at all in Explorers, little-to-none in Scouts.

Now, I'm actually not worried in the slightest about recent results because of the amount of youngsters that have been given a chance and the quality of our game. The only game which I hold real resentment is the one against Arsenal, as by the end the Arsenal fans were outsinging Anfield. Rodgers has done an amazing job to keep the supporters firmly on his back yet it is true that we need to get results again for this project to grow exponentially. Think about how morale not only in the squad but in young players all over the world would increase if they saw this massively young squad get some wins in the Premier League playing beautifully. This would also help us lure young, exciting talent which I personally think is vital as unfortunately we have a policy for buying youth players which I am a firm believer in. 

Hitting another ball, I think our defense has suffered a lot in quality since last year. This can still be attributed to the lack of a natural defensive midfielder that we are missing in Lucas, but I believe that the coaching level for defense has dropped since Clark left thus why Skrtel (whom before Clark was hugely inconsistent) has dropped in form a bit. I hope that these problems can fix over time as we have a monster CB in Coates whom I believe will excel.

true,ozmars,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The Classic series is a lot of fun, but very different to TV of today.  Many people find it easier to get into the new Who which started in 2005 with Chris Eccleston as the 9th Doctor.  The most recent series finished a few weeks ago and if you check go read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorWho/faq) there is a list of places you can watch Doctor Who legally.  

Further down in the sidebar there is a link to a place where you can watch Classic Who episodes.  The biggest thing to remember when watching Classic if you haven't seen it is that it was filmed a long time ago.  The first episodes are in black and white and some people find them a bit slow compared to the modern fast-paced television we are used to.  Then there's the special effects.  In some cases they are quite dated, but if you go into Classic without expecting some fast-paced, modern, CGI containing show you can probably still get into it.

Ultimately, it's up to you, there is no best place to start, try some Classic and see if you like it.  Try some New and see if you like it.  Recommendations on where to start are often coloured by our favourite Doctors.  For example, for Classic I personally would recommend either the Tom Baker (#4) or John Pertwee (#3) episodes whereas others might recommend different Doctors.  The same goes for New Who.  That said you can jump in to the New without needing to have seen any of the Classic eps.",0,1350603340,null,0,false,0,c6ojyac,t3_11pu6k,t1_c6ojyac,t3_11pu6k,null,1430184052,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The notion that Defoe is a cold-blooded finisher is kind of a myth IMO. 10% of his shots are goals right now, which is pretty abysmal. This is partially because he takes tons of shots that are really stupid, but it's also because he fucking misses a ton. He could probably have another 4-5 goals already. I don't think his finishing from inside the box is even much better than Adebayor's. His long shots are 16 in the game, I might even make them 17. But his actual finishing is solid but not insane.

No offense, but you're deluding yourself if you think that we can currently pull in big name players. The only draw we have at the moment is Rodgers (and he's yet to be established), and our history, which modern players are placing less and less emphasis on. Lewandowski may want to play in the EPL, but he will not sacrifice CL football to do so.

&gt;Being in the CL is only so appealing.

The UEFA CL is the highest, most prestigous level of football available. Players don't want to play in it because they think they're going to win it every season, they want to play in it because it's the best competition around. It will get them the most attention, money, and respect. CL football is the most appealing thing there is for a player of Lewandowski's age, skill, and reputation.

He would be just as likely, if not more, to come to Spurs or Arsenal as he would be to come to us. They have a much higher chance of CL, and, given that FSG are trying to tone down our spending, they can probably pay more too. Chelsea do not have a full front line up, they have an aging Torres and an inconsistent Sturridge. There will be plenty of room for Lewandowski up front.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I think they generally do a really good job at this but I do have a few question marks.

1) Vertonghen's passing @ 12. It seems to be sort of a standard ball-playing CB number (I think Vermaelen has 12 as well) but I would probably go 14. Kaboul's passing is 11 which is about right, but comparatively with Jan that's way off. His FK is probably 1-2 too high as well; he doesn't score them THAT regularly. Also think he's 1-2 points faster. Watch the QPR counter attack. 

2) Hugo's kicking. No, he's not a Spanish-style ball-playing keeper like Reina or even De Gea, but TEN? Surely it should be 12-13. 

3) Scott Parker's heading and jumping. Since height means nothing in the match engine, the jumping stat is pretty much the catch-all ""what sort of pass height can this player head."" IE Peter Crouch has like 18 jumping when his aerial strength is mostly because of his height. Why in the world does Parker have 1 less jumping than Livermore and 1 more heading? These two players will more or less have identical aerial effectiveness, even though one is ~5'8 and the other is 6'2. Bizarre. 

4) Bale and Lennon having identical pace and acceleration stats. It's pretty obvious Azza has a quicker short burst but Bale has superior top end and stamina. ",0,1350604626,null,0,false,0,c6ok9rj,t3_11phx6,t1_c6ok9rj,t3_11phx6,null,1430184203,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

 Also our history, your wrong again Sahin for a start chose us over Arsenal because of out history and even with our weakest prem team EVER (last season) we still won a cup and reached the FA cup final.

Your BADLY over valuing spurs and arsenal at a shocking level... AVB is already unpopular at spurs (doesnt look like he'll be there long) and there team is full of holes so far bale has rescued them a number of times, Arsenal would have finished lower than us if RVP hadnt had a wonder season last year. Theres a reason arsenals best players have left, the only good thing about them is wenger knows how to get the best out of what he has and they can be consistent, but they wont be winning anything in the near future (not to mention they have some of the worst fans who call for wengers head everytime they lose)

Again I never said he is, but, going by reports and what we need its still speculation, but from what you've said you've badly underestimated us on a pretty shocking level.

You have to remember in the last 5-6 years we've had to battle the MASSIVE spendings of United, Chelsea, City and Arsenal, their billionaire owners provide much more than we can dream of, also our 3rd manager in 3 years, 3 different styles under new ownership and we've only dropped to 8th...shit when newcastle went through an management change they got relegated

First off, they're affected by the accuracy of your scouting staff, and Tottenham starts off with a weak scouting department.  

Secondly, they're affected by the strength of your team.  If you were managing a League 1 team, every EPL player would show up as a 5 star prospect.  I'm guessing Dembele is 3 stars because of his age and because of our depth in midfield, although he might have a relatively low CA/PA.  Walker being a 4 star RB is actually really good.  Later in the game, with a full strength scouting staff, you'll never find a RB or LB with  more than 3.5 stars (This includes Walker)

Third, they're affected by the age of the player in question.  Last year, Neymar and Goetze were the only 4.5 star players I could find, because they were so good and so young.

I'd hazard a guess and say that the main reason was (and meant with no offense, I'm being serious) because people such as yourself don't even know what an MEP is, which also means they didn't vote. If they did vote, that may be even worse.

The thing that gets me the most about this is that I hear so much moaning by people, by politicians and by certain sections of the media about the EU, while we have democratically elected and sent this twat along with another BNP representative as part of our nation's representation, with some of our voting power as well.

We haven't got any BNP MPs right now, so why Europe? Because many people don't pay an interest, allowing those with radical views to have more power in their opinions, while the casual big party voter takes a day off from this one.

Essentially our center backs NEED to win their 1 on 1s every time, or there's an obvious goal scoring opportunity.

I put a lot of the mental errors that Skrtel and Agger have committed down to this too. They're being forced to run their asses off, as well as being mentally strong the entire game, and it's causing mental fatigue in my opinion.

No it isn't. Atheism is the ***lack*** of belief in ***any*** deity and nothing else whatsoever. By definition, it is the exact *opposite* of a belief. 

This argument – like the one that states atheism requires as much ""faith"" as belief in god/s does – is frequently posited by religious types as a  way of lending legitimacy to their own beliefs. Their agenda is clearly to make the two positions somehow equal, when they are nothing of the sort. One side is making extraordinary claims and the other side is merely saying, ""that's nonsense!""

&gt;A lack of religious beliefs better desccribes a lack of religious opinion (agnosticism) IMO.

Um, agnosticism isn't what you seem to think it is. There is a popular misconception that it is a weaker form of atheism – a kind of *don't know* position, if you will – but that's not what it is at all. Agnosticism simply states it is impossible to know the truth about whether god/s exist. Most atheists are also agnostic and so are many religious adherents, because absolutism without absolute proof is foolish, whichever side you sit on.",0,1350608740,null,0,false,0,c6olaqu,t3_11ok5y,t1_c6olaqu,t1_c6oi6zg,null,1430184694,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

As far as buying goes, sometime within the upcoming year the team is going to need to be looking for an AM. I know there's Shelvey but Gerrard won't be able to play forever on all cylinders, and Cole is up there as well. Obviously another kind of forward/goalscorer/finisher is in much need.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"&gt;*why they assume atheists are incapable or unwilling to learn or consider other belief systems* //

There is no such assumption. As far as I could/can tell it was because BP founded the group with a central focus on the spiritual nature of man and that he thus insisted that the group be [mono]theistic.

&gt;*spiritual development could be defined as a willingness to learn, to converse and consider outwith the actual act of worship or prayer* //

In the same way that camping could be done by watching a film about it. Theological study and faith are non-coterminous.

&gt;*to be denied that by a group who preach inclusion* //

The Scout Association isn't preventing your parents from taking someone and a group of their friends camping. Indeed you could set up a parallel cub group that did everything that a cub group does but with the exclusion of any spiritual elements or requirements. It's a volunteer run organisation, you literally get a couple of adults to run a group, hire a hall and there you have it. Most Scout campsites can be hired equally by non-Scout groups, same for facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------

This is very important, very.

If you are in a pub and drinking with anyone, stranger, friend, classmate, workmate it doesn't matter and you are about to order a drink, it is extremely rude not to offer to buy your companions a drink too.  This is not some trick, you'll notice immediately that people will offer to get you a drink when you are out with them.  They are not being super nice and friendly to a visitor, they are doing it under the implicit agreement that you will buy the next drink for them.

If the group is too big it will generally break up into smaller rounds, generally appropriately sized to the amount of drinks the group is expecting to have that night.  If there are 10 people out it will likely break up into approximately 2 to 3 rounds, based on who arrived when, and who has finished their drink faster.  When you find yourself in a round, stick with it.  Don't start buying drinks for someone in another round and you **must** refuse an offer of a drink if the person doing the offering is not in your round.  All you need to say is 'No thanks, I'm sorted, I'm in a round with Andy and Dave already'.  If you accept the drink you will have joined their round and you'll need to 'even up' in the first round by buying a round before you leave it.  It's easier to stick with your original round throughout the night, though it is acceptable to change rounds if the venue changes during a pub crawl, but only after attempting to reform your original round in the new pub and failing for some reason.

It's quite OK to come out behind or ahead on a round when the night finishes, you might find you've bought 8 pints but only drank 7, or bought 8 and drank 9.  That's OK, these things even out, if you've made a genuine effort to buy a round before the night ends then no one will hold it against you that you've had a free drink that night.  It all evens out in the end.

You will be *despised* if you make no effort to get your own round in.  As above, there is an expectation of reciprocation attached to that offer, if you do not reciprocate, you can expect things to turn sour, fast.  The best case scenario is that people will talk about you behind your back, not invite you out on a night out and be disappointed if you turn up to meet them.  Worst case is probably that you're called out on it, or ditched during the night.

So to sum up in a few simple rules:

1. On entering a pub to meet friends try to join a round as soon as possible.  It is as simple as saying: 'I'm off to the bar, who needs a drink?'  If two or three people say yeah, then that's your round.

2. If someone offers to buy you a drink and you accept you are now in a round with them and also anyone else who was in the round with them when you accepted the drink, this is crucial to remember.  Don't bite off more than you can chew.

3. Remember the ordering of the round, if person A buys first, followed by person B and then you, that is the order in which rounds must be bought for the rest of the night.  Keep track of this, someone might offer to buy the next round on your turn because they have finished their drink but you still have some left.  Don't let them, insist on buying your round, they are only asking politely for you to get a move on, they are not genuinely keen on buying a round out of turn.

4. If you feel like you can't go another full cycle it is acceptable to exit the round on an even turn (i.e. when you have bought as much as you have drunk) by declining a further round with the words: 'No it's OK, thanks, I'm only going to have one more, so I'll get it myself'.  Likely the person will insist on buying you the drink anyway, and it's OK to accept if you have made a genuine effort to buy your own drink.  Tell them 'cheers, I'll get you back the next night'.

5. Don't get into more than one round at the same time.  Refuse the offer of a drink from anyone who is not in your round.  Tell the person you are in a round and they'll understand.

6. Do *not* get yourself a reputation for being a 'cheapskate' or being 'skingy'.  Avoid this by being generous and always making a genuine effort to buy as much drink as you consume.

7. Try to make your drink of similar monetary value to those of your companions in the round.  If they are drinking pints of Stella don't ask for a double Gin &amp; Tonic.

8.  Keep the round order intact for as long as anyone is present and can still speak.

9.  Be timely with your round, don't leave a companion with an empty glass when it's your turn to get the round.  Try to match your drinking pace with them.  If you are too slow then switch to half pints or be prepared to have full pints queued up in front of you.  If you are drinking halves and they are drinking pints that's your choice and is tough on you, you'll end up paying for more drink than you consume.  If you point out that they are saving money on buying you halves you will be deemed a cheapskate.

10.  Always, always, always make a genuine effort to 'even up' by buying as much drink for others as is bought for you.  Some days you'll be ahead, some behind, but British people take the attitude that it all evens out over a lifetime anyway, so fuck it.

I hope this helps you settle in, there's nothing worse than being out with some prick who thinks you're a great guy for buying them drinks all night without putting their own hand in their pocket.",0,1350612630,null,0,false,0,c6ombce,t3_11q0re,t1_c6ombce,t3_11q0re,null,1430185173,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Just remember, we're self-deprecating (as seen by Mukuro's comment), so just go with it.  We're also sarcastic, so you will get ""the piss taken out of you"", but it's not generally meant with malice, so just go with it and give it back at an applicable level, with humour in your voice.  We can also be very subtle with our humour, so you need to watch for subtle undertones when speaking with people.

We're pessimistic as opposed to many Americans who're generally more optimistic, so that's one trait that you may need to get used to.  We moan a lot, but we don't complain very much. For example (in a restaurant):

Dave: (whispering) ""My soup is a bit cold""

Andy: ""Yeah, my chicken is a bit overdone too""

Waiter: *comes over* ""Is everything all right""

Andy/Dave: ""Yeah, it's fine, really nice, thanks""

Don't talk to people on public transport. People who start talking on public transport are often nutters, so you might be seen as one.  If you're on the tube in London, don't look at anybody, eye contact must never be made.

The one thing that I found difficult talking to someone from the US military (and worse, from the Southern US) was being called ""Sir"". Last time, I ended up having to explain why I was pulling faces all the time. Although I'm a bit extreme, I think a lot of Brits don't like being called ""Sir"".

Reason - it feels excessive, as if someone's grovelling to me or trying to manipulate me.

Of course I understand that in the military, and for people from the southern US, it's more of a reflex. It just takes a bit to adjust and meet in the middle because I'm not used to it.

Also, it helps to have a sense of humour, but it doesn't help that the American and British sense of humour are a bit different.

So basically, it's culture-differences 101 - occasional weirdness, but we aren't all that alien to each other.

If you enjoyed The Inbetweeners at all Friday Night Dinner is pretty good, at least series 1 was pretty good, Simon Bird from The Inbetweeners is in it.  The first episode of series 2 seems the writers tried to go too big with it and came across as a bit obnoxious at times, but I like following actors so, there's that.

Phone shop is rubbish.  I don't think it got renewed anyhow.

Doctor Who of course is brilliant and the newest season seems that Moffat took a page from his show Sherlock in terms of filming style and general production, particularly the first episode had a distinct film quality feel to it that he achieves well on Sherlock.  I'm sure you've watched though as it's probably the most commonly watched British show in the US.

QI is a great panel show with Stephen Fry.

Bad Education I'm hot and cold on.  I don't know, I like the students I think they are all doing a great job but the main character, the teacher, seems to be getting some crap dialogue and forced to be as obnoxious as possible.

Red Dwarf is starting back up shortly, it might be well worth it to catch up on the old episodes and give it a go.  I get the feeling that they are going to open it up in a way that a new viewer can latch on to though without any previous knowledge of the show.

This was not him being killed and erased; he was alive and alone. Amy truly showed her devotion to him as she expressed in S07E01-Asylum of the Daleks.

Well I really don't know why you seemed to fixate on this in my original post.

&gt; He could have made his mind up AND be confused. 

If you have ever spoken to someone who teaches RE to kids that age you would know that a reasonable proportion have no interest in any religion and regard it as a nonsense. 

&gt; And there's no reason he couldn't make that oath with his fingers crossed.

I thought that the scouts were supposed to promote integrity and virtue. Encouraging someone to lie under oath is not a great introduction to these principles.

&gt; He's not been banned.

Effectively he is being told that he is not welcome unless he is prepared to lie under oath. He appears to have enough integrity to determine that this is wrong and he is not prepared to idly stand by and be discriminated against.

&gt; I'm adding to the discussion, which is what is supposed to happen, but because they don't agree with my opinion they are downvoting and thus censoring me. 

Well if you want your opinions to be taken seriously, it might help if you tried to avoid calling people things like ""a massive blubbery vagina of a person"".

The chances are at some point, someone will appear to insult you. Knowing the Brits it will be around the theme of being American. This is likely a test to see how you react and you will be judged by this first reaction. You must not show any annoyance, you must laugh in a self depreciating way (as an American you'd better practice this it doesn't come naturally. You are a proud and irritatingly loud people) and take the piss right back. The return insult should be on the same theme as the insult taken i.e. nationality, but keep it light to start and avoid ""Yeh well we saved your asses in WWII"" because seriously this has been used by every gobshite American ever and it will just elicit groans and rolled eyes from all Brits in earshot.

1. Jen Chang fiasco - all the act of one individual, hired by FSG true, but only due to an exemplary track record with other sports brands. Can't blame them there

2. Failing to buy a striker - A mistake, one made on a philosophy of not overspending on older players (of course you can argue that Dempsey's fee was not 'overspending') but a mistake, not a FAILURE

3. Suarez race row - I'm sorry, you're telling me there was some way that a PR team could have somehow spun that into a positive, or even slightly LESS NEGATIVE story? I would love to hear how.

3. Fly on the wall documentary - Jesus fucking christ, you can't handle a few cameras and some extra scrutiny. I find the aversion to this exceedingly neurotic. NFL teams handle it with absolutely no issue every year. Just an excuse to pass the blame, which brings me to the main point...

3)if all else fails go to the main test socket and plug in directly to there, if you still get no connection give Sky a ring.

In other words they were trying to royally rip us off. This FTR was around 1999. 

Basically at the time I was a pretty angry kid ( as you are when you've just lost both your parents ) I went ballistic and threatened to hire a flatbed and pull the static off the site and sell it elsewhere. They told me I couldn't do that and I told them: Yes I could, I owned the static, it's technically a mobile home, so therefore I could: "" Do what the fuck I want with it."" At the time I was deadly serious, this was my plan and I would have quite happily done it.  

 They upped the offer to £3500 without the alarm crap and my sister ( much to my protests ) excepted the offer. 

I still regret to this day not pulling off their site and selling it privately, Just on principle. 

I guess the moral of this story is: threaten to pull it off the site, it's their caravan, they can do what they want with it and the people running these parks are scam merchants.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"This fixture will be a tricky one. First of all it's a derby, so form usually goes out the window for these clashes. To be honest, I would have expected form to maintain its course if we had played them before the international break, but now Sheffield Wednesday have had a good chance to iron out their problems and the instinctive pessimist in me says that this is the perfect fixture for Wednesday to break out of their rut and end our good run in a reversal of fortune.

The fact we're probably going to miss Austin will only help that - Warnock says he wasn't 100% and played through an ankle problem against Barnsley and in Jamaica's matches, while more importantly they didn't know where he was yesterday! We should at least have Brown (and Tonge - I expect him to be fit) to cover the defensive side, though, which suits Green and Norris, so I'm curious to see what one of them can do. The thought did strike me that Warnock could play Green on the right, but I'd be surprised if he genuinely started the game with all of the midfield four being central midfielders.

He could also drop White, start Drury at left-back and move Byram to the right wing, which wouldn't overly surprise me, but I'm going to expect him to stick with the team that kept a clean sheet against Barnsley, albeit without Austin.

So, despite my wariness of a script being written tonight that will reverse both teams' fortunes, I can't see Leeds getting a bad result when I block out my gut instinct. I can, however, see them conceding a goal. My prediction: *2-1 to Leeds* (I hope that comes up in bold; I'm not using RES this time), although I sort of get the feeling that it could be more high-scoring than that.

Here's the team I predict Warnock to play:

-----------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Pearce---Peltier

White---Norris---Brown---Tonge

-----------Diouf

-----------Becchio

How is only having to go to a bar once every x drinks less convenient?

Rounds are more socialable, you get to stay together as a group whilst one person at a time gets the drinks.  It also forms a bond between the people in the round.

true,Honey-Badger,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"You may call me some right wing elitist or whatever for thinking this but this is how i view the situation. My parents both come from poor backgrounds, my mother grew up in India (to English parents) all funded by the church of England (missionaries) and her family came back to England when she was 16 and they basically had no money and had to start a new life. My father is the son of a dock worker and a nurse, grew up in a tough west country area and were basically working class to the corse. They both worked their arses off so that they could live a better life, they married in their early 20's but didn't have kids until they were 40ish because they didn't want to have kids when they weren't finically stable. 

They worked hard so that they could give their offspring a better chance, its only natural to want to see your offspring get a better chance at life. I also intend to work fucking hard so that i can give my kids everything they want. I intend to become the best at everything i do so that i can watch my kids (hopefully i'll have some in years to come) love their life and want for nothing. I personally dont think its unfair on the children of those that dont have the same drive as me that i want to work hard to so i can give more. 

I dont understand this view that we should all be given a completely equal opportunity at success, i think the fight to the top build character, those who have come from 'rags to riches' are incredibly inspirational to everyone no matter what background. We currently have a system that allows you to get to university no matter how poor you are, i have friends that are at uni who have grown up to single parents in rough neighbourhoods and have just worked hard and succeeded so they can get to where they are today, im sure it want easy for them but life isn't  supposed to be easy.

You're correct, but that doesn't mean you couldn't fortify the island more and make it very hard to invade. We haven't because we have a navy that works as a floating defence system.  

More anti aircraft missile sites/radar, more jets, a bunch of apache helicopters. That'd make light work of any kind of invasion attempt from Argentina. 

I'm sure a few hundred of the soldiers getting let go from the armed forces here in the UK wouldn't mind doing 6 month tours on the Falklands Islands. The pay would be good since the GDP of such a small nation would be ridiculously high. Money to burn. 

Then you could promote the idea of a well armed militia too. It'd make the Falklands a lot less attractive of a target.

Only problem I could see would be a siege type scenario where the Falklands is cut off from supplies. You'd need previsions in place for that.

I agree they can be unrelated, but they talk about and discuss spiritual development. Not faith development. As I have been told (again, straight from the horses mouth. though i am sure my sister wouldn't enjoy being called a horse) god doesn't factor in it so much, simply the willingness to investigate the spiritual side of your existence; they use the word spiritual a lot. the word faith really doesn't seem to factor as much.

That last bit about taking people camping is a)simplifying the nature of the scouting movement by a painful degree and b) ignorant of the huge amount of organisation and dedication that the leaders input into the groups they lead. You are correct, any one can go camping. But scouting is so much more than that, as you might expect from over a hundred years of generating what essentially amounts to a curriculum of learning. 

Of course they could. They just shouldn't have to make their own group. Everything about this situation is contradictory. They are inclusive, yet deny certain children for their perspectives. they say faith isn't the issue, yet deny children (and potential leaders)for whom faith doesn't factor in their lives.

true,TheFergPunk,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"And here's some explanation on those points.

* 1  No sources given on this claim and if you actually go and research the netherlands marriage rates you'll notice they've been in decline since the 70s not since same-sex marriage got introduced; so the plummet comment isn't valid.  It's not even the biggest drop that happened in the 70s; in fact the year after legislation there was an increase then it went back to the process it has been on for the last 30 years.

* 2 This point is essentially stating that any change they are ok with is just a tweak but any change they are not ok with goes against the nature of marriage.  It's nothing but bad rhetoric there's no reason given as to why they should be against this change and not any other change made.

* 3  the statement ""Redefine marriage for everyone else"" is a loaded term because it implies that heterosexual couples will be negatively affected by it.  Civil Partnerships do not offer the same rights this has been debunked on numerous occasions; being married gains you a lot more protection abroad than being in a civil partnership.  If for example a civil partnership couple went to portugal and one of them fell ill they would not have the next of kin rights granted to a married couple even though portugal recognises same-sex marriage and that is because they don't recognise civil partnerships at all.  Allowing same-sex marriage here is a quick and easy fix to that problem.

And to that note even if they had every right that still doesn't constitute a reason against same-sex marriage it's a non-sequitar at best.

* 4  How does this point differ from the excuse creationists use about teaching?  It's a teachers job to teach kids facts not opinion.  If same-sex marriage becomes legalised then that's a fact for them to teach.  This is just scare-mongering at best.

* 5  Slippery slope is a logical fallacy; this is an example of it.  This is bad.

* 6  This point I'll give some credit to.  While the view that homosexuals should not be allowed to be married is a bigotted view; having said view doesn't instantly make you a bigot.  Some people are just misinformed; they believe the stuff groups like C4M spout and their local preacher.  So you may not be a bigot; you may just be stubbornly misinformed.  Saying that people who refuse to listen to the facts on the issue and don't change their view when confrotned with rational arguments; these people are bigots.

* 7  The poll mentioned was a flawed poll.  The question asked if they wanted to marry their current partner; this is very different from the issue at hand which is the ability to marry.

* 8  This other figure is also from a flawed poll in which they stated the loaded statement I mentioned earlier and they also stated the same rights lie as well.  Not to mention it was conducted by themselves (c4m) not really a non-biased source.  Look at the polls conducted recently in scotland most people arne't against it.

* 9  The husband and wife claim has been proven false they will not be removed it will just be altered to allow same-sex couples.  This far-reaching impact is not mentioned and for such a claim it definately should.

* 10  Scaremongering claim and claims with no proof.  Anyone can make claims like this rather easily.

To finish; C4M are a group I'm very familiar with.  They have told numerous lies and have no trouble only showing a small window of data to make something look bad instead of the full example (e.g. the netherlands example from earlier).

This commission decreases based on the number of trades you make per month.  As I do it infrequently, I'm paying the maximum commission they charge per trade.

The stock you're looking at purchasing has some bearing on how much you *need* to invest.  If you want to invest in [Shell](http://www.google.co.uk/finance?q=LON%3ARDSA&amp;ei=3zmBUID2LOmtwAOAvQE) for example, the shares are over £20 each, so £200 won't even buy you 10.  That said, you're looking at making a *percentage* profit, not a £ profit.  Example: a 10% profit on a £20 share is £2 (multiplied by however many shares you own).  A 10% profit on a £0.20 share is just 2p.  However, you'll be able to afford 100 times as many 20p shares as you would £20 shares, therefore, a 10% profit is still a 10% profit.

Although ""10% is 10%,"" if you're investing ""small"" sums of money (let's say £200), you're already £12 down just on paying commission to make the trade (other stockbrokers have different fees and structures, but they have to make money somewhere, and will charge commission).  So say you've bought 10x£20 shares minus your fee.  You're already 6% down, and be aware, to cash in your shares you have to pay the commission again to *sell* them!  So you're essentially 12% down already.  You need to make 12% just to break even. 

Big companies with big share prices are less likely to fluctuate drastically*, so it'll be harder to make a profit, or even your money back, if you're investing very little.  If you invest £100k however, the £12 commission is irrelevant, and a 1% rise in share price nets you a grand for nothing more than a few mouse clicks.

Cheaper stock tends to fluctuate more (see Rockhopper history) and is where (I believe) people like myself who don't dare gamble four figures on the markets (yet) can turn a profit, as I have.

One thing to be aware of is which markets you can trade on.  With Barclays I can only trade on the London Stock Exchange (and not all companies, especially smaller ones, do not trade on all markets - NYSE, NASDAQ).

For example he has called for [demonstrations against a gay couple](http://uk.news.yahoo.com/bnp-leader-threatened-gay-couple-twitter-221817239.html) whose only crime was to take a B&amp;B owner who refused to give them accommodation ""on religious grounds"" to court. They won.

Then there are his attitudes to homosexuality [aired during his Question Time appearance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJaZAelQjZ0), where he argues what people do in their own homes is up to them but that ""militant homosexuals"" (whatever they might be), should be stopped from having influence in debates on public policy.

But of course those are just purely personal opinions, and people can do one thing and say another all the time - it's not as if he's calling for public policy to really fundamentally change is he? As a party political leader, that kind of hypocrisy would undermine him entirely and might cause his leadership to be challenged. So that won't happen... oh, wait, no... From [the BNP Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_National_Party):

&gt;The BNP states that homosexuality in private should be tolerated but believes that it ""should not be promoted or encouraged"". It is opposed to civil partnerships and wishes to ban what it perceives as the promotion of homosexuality in schools and the media. It proposes that homosexuality should be returned ""to the closet"".

&gt; BNP spokesman Phil Edwards stated that homosexuality ""is unnatural"" and ""does not lead to procreation but does lead to moral turpitude and disease"". Mark Collett, former Director of Publicity for the party, has described homosexuals as ""AIDS Monkeys"", ""bum bandits"" and ""faggots"", saying the idea of homosexuality was a ""sickening thought"".

&gt; In the run-up to the 2005 general election, it was reported that Richard Barnbrook, the BNP candidate for Barking, had produced a homoerotic student art film in 1989. Barnbrook and the BNP claimed that the film was artistic and about ""sexuality, not homosexuality"".

&gt; The BNP was criticised over a web article titled, ""Liars, buggers and thieves"", which grouped several gay politicians in with convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles. The author, BNP councillor Julian Leppert, defended it and said that the reason why gay MPs were included was because, ""it fits in with the headline, the bugger part, I guess"", and stated that the BNP are ""a family party with family values"".

&gt; It has been alleged that Nick Griffin had a four year homosexual relationship with Martin Webster, although Griffin denies this. In 2009, he said: ""a lot of people find the sight of two grown men kissing in public really creepy. I understand that homosexuals don't understand that but that's how a lot of us feel.""

So when you have a public figure, leading a political party that wants homosexuality to be ""in the closet"", and staffed with people who are clearly homophobic, and that wants to end civil partnerships and that publishes literature that tries to draw a subconscious connection between gays, murderers and paedophiles, and it then turns out that he might himself be gay... well, that undermines him, no?

Probably.

Were the intention to include the unmarried as protected under the act, it would have included a similar clause to the one on religion, or would have refered to marital status instead.

It's remarkable how little the act actually does, it seems appallingly badly drafted.

An ellipse is made when you intersect a plane with a cone at an angle, and a circle is a special case when that plane is horizontal.

Another way to think of it is that ellipses (centered on the origin) can also be defined by two focal points (f, 0), (-f, 0) such that for any point P on the ellipse, the sum of the distances P to (f, 0) and P to (-f, 0) is twice the major radius.  So if P = (x, y), then ((x - f)^2 + y^2 )^0.5 + ((x + f)^2 + y^2 )^0.5 = 2a.  If the focal points are the same, then f = -f = 0, so the equation becomes 2(x^2 + y^2 )^0.5 = 2a =&gt; x^2 + y^2 = a^2, which is the equation for the circle or radius a.",0,1350651982,null,0,false,0,c6osb9x,t3_11qjx6,t1_c6osb9x,t1_c6os2g0,null,1430188001,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Point is, ones culture is forged by observing other people, and we don't all see the same thing. Someone born into a black family is more likely to pick up their culture because their family brought them up like themselves. Alternatively, say the black child was adopted by a white family, the child could still exhibit aspects of black culture because of social expectations peer pressure and observations in wider media while incorporating some of their adopted families culture as well.

This is also one of the reasons people have such a diverse range of personalities because no one is brought up exactly the same way. Although there can easily be inherent traits in the structure of the brain, they would appear to be negligible.

You cannot use the wisdom of crowds to predict something, only estimate something.

Edit: sorry I replied before reading your comment probably. You want me to debunk a rational solution so here goes:

Wisdom of crowds depends on people making estimates. There are statistically as many going over as there are going under the actual amount and these average out.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The problem I have with that argument is that the natural conclusion is that we would essentially have to blanket ban this sort of discrimination.  We legislate that nobody can discriminate when choosing to do business with somebody, on the basis of that other person belonging to a certain social, racial, religious, ethnic, sexual, or other group.  
  
On the face of it, that seems reasonable, and I wholeheartedly support the idea that we generally shouldn't be basing our decisions about whether to do business with somebody on the basis of their skin colour, religion, sexuality, or anything else that isn't directly relevant to the business dealings.  But the problem is that such a ban would have unintended side effects.  
  
You'd affect a lot of businesses that currently discriminate and which are both legal and generally seen as acceptable.  Things like the women-only gyms, men's barbers, and private faith schools would be legally forced to open their doors to people who don't fit their intended markets, or to shut down entirely.  
  
At the very least, I don't think that bringing that situation about is any *more* responsible of an authority.  But that's not really why I support making this sort of thing legal.  It's not about libertarian principles either - broadly speaking, I'm a centrist.

Number 5: Aside from being too complex, supposes that on the occasion of a Dalek being helpful The Doctor would ignore his history with the Daleks.  And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.

Number 4: Theories 4 and 3 are for all intents and purposes the same thing.  Playing a related character is still a different character and there is precedent for actors playing different characters in the series.  With the exception that Jenna played Oswin after already being selected as the new companion where as Karen and Freema did not even audition for companion roles until after there previous roles.

Number 2: Clara is a Cylon. Worse yet, a Mary Sue.  The author of the article says that this theory could lead to ""...many possibilities throughout the show.""  I see one.  --OMG craziness all around, how do we fix/escape this one.  Clara, you're a genius, after all you managed to transfer your consciousness to an android, figure this out!--  Also, she is still a Dalek!

Number 1: Firstly, paradox alarm!  Even if The Doctor doesn't recognize her voice, she would recognize him.  Which, we get no indication that she did in Asylum of the Daleks.  Now, you could say that the process of becoming a Dalek screwed up her memory.  Sure, she remembers how to make a souffle but, not The Doctor.  Also, this theory has Clara's story starting the same way as River's.  No amount of mental gymnastics or apologetics will let my brain go there.  River is the most important person in The Doctor's life to date, I can't see Moffet cheapening the story by repeating it like that. A possible story arc is postulated for this theory in which The Doctor saves Clara from ever going to the asylum in the first place.  Thus preventing Oswin from ever saving The Doctor and erasing records of him throughout the universe.  Which is great, except for the scene in Angels when The Doctor and Amy meet River in 1938 and she explains that she was pardoned because it turns out the man she was supposed to have murdered never existed.

Having Jenna in Asylum whet out appetites to see her as the new companion and gave Moffet a chance to see how fans would react to her as an actress in the Who universe.  Nothing is lost if there is no connection between Oswin and Clara.  Of course I could be totally wrong, but hey we're all just guessing anyway.  I just don't see anyone need for there to be a connection.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You'd affect a lot of businesses that currently discriminate and which are both legal and generally seen as acceptable. Things like the women-only gyms, men's barbers, and private faith schools would be legally forced to open their doors to people who don't fit their intended markets, or to shut down entirely.  
  
I think there needs to be a distinction drawn between businesses that cater specifically to a particular group of people for a purpose (for instance, how men generally prefer to have their hair cut differently to how women prefer it), and businesses who don't cater to a particular group of people because the organisation has prejudices against them. I'm certain a government decision to criminalise discrimination would bear that in mind.  
  
&gt;  It's not about libertarian principles either  
  
I apologise if it sounded like I was pigeonholing, it wasn't my intention at all.  
  
&gt; I just think it's an important aspect of any liberal democracy that we be free to decide who we interact with in the first place, even if most of us think that the reasons for making those decisions are immoral.
  
I recognise that a line needs to be made where we simply have totally different ideas on business regulations, but I'll explain my objection the best I can.  
  
The problem for me is that allowing a business to freely turn away any customers they want for whatever reason is that it assumes that people do not need their government to ensure a fair society. One cannot always expect individuals to take an objection to things they perceive as unrighteous when governments won't. If we think back to 1940s-60s America when segregation was a particular issue, it took the many civil rights groups in the 60s to instigate change because the local authorities were corrupt, anyone who had objections were afraid to speak out and the government weren't doing anything to stop it. Point I'm trying to make is that people don't always object to things like discrimination when somebody should, and if everybody, including the government, stay silent, the problem grows and becomes normalised.

true,captain_ramshackle,uk,Kingston Upon Thames,"&gt;Many things are legal, but ethically wrong.

I'm not sure I agree with that statement but for now I'll assume I do.

If the publicly traded company's foremost duty is to the shareholders, many of whom will not be in the UK, why should ethical issues which primarily affect UK citizens take precedence? If the majority of the shareholders were in the US, the company was a US company then shouldn't it try and pay as little tax in other countries to maximise the return for the US shareholders who will then pay capital gains tax?

I don't see how it's considered more ethical to pay less to shareholders outside a country purely so that you can pay unnecessary taxes to another country. In the same way that if I held shares in a British company trading overseas I wouldn't want my dividend to be reduced purely so I can put what I'd consider to be my money in the hands of a foreign government.

Still working under the hypothetical assumption that rates are prohibitively high - which I'm not sure they are? Many businesses that comply with their obligations are doing fine.

&gt;my argument is more complex than that. of course not all are doing extreme tax avoidance/evasion. and of course we can criticise it. the point is you are supporting it everyday, indirectly, simply be existing and purchasing anything within our capitalist system. every time you fill the car, click an ad online, get your door fixed, tip a waiter, buy a new shirt, your money sloshes around to various tax avoiders. 

Yep, and it sucks. Your average individual has no way of avoiding taxes himself - it's taken directly out of his pay packet, and made added automatically to every purchase he makes. It's a complete double standard. Yes, Starbucks probably contribute more in one year than I do in an entire lifetime - but as a percentage of income, far less. 

&gt;and these laws exist, don't they?

General anti avoidance? No, not as I'm aware.

Watch Enigma or Svengali or any other theatre show of his - the ones where he chooses volunteers by throwing a frisbee into the audience are *real* tricks - you can't bias a frisbee to land in a particular person's hand.

The scariest monsters I can think of (e.g., the xenomorph, slenderman, *Amnesia*'*s* gatherers) all have one thing in common: you barely see them. 

The person that can scare you the best is yourself; you are the only one who knows your fears, your weaknesses, and your apprehensions. So, making a scary monster is very simple: all you have to do is make sure that the victim sees as little of them as possible—because, then the victim, because he can't see the monster, has to imagine what the monster is doing, and he always thinks of the scariest things.

This is why the angels are so damn scary: when you see them, they're just simple ordinary statues. But looking at them *ipso facto* makes them statues; when you're not looking at them, they're doing something—creeping, lunging, teeth fully bared—and you can't see it.

There were several forms of written Gallifreyan. By the time of the Doctor, the archaic Old High Gallifreyan language used in the days of Rassilon had changed considerably. (TV: The Five Doctors)


Old High Gallifreyan was the ancient language of the Time Lords. It was not known by many; by the Doctor's era, it was virtually extinct, superseded by modern Gallifreyan. The Eleventh Doctor claimed that Old High Gallifreyan once possessed immense power when correctly harnessed, such as raising empires or destroying gods. (TV: The Time of Angels)
The written form of Old High Gallifreyan resembled, to human eyes, a mixture of Greek letters and mathematical symbols.

TBH, the creators take great artistic freedom in the creation of this show, and the creation of a new language that is circular geometric shapes does not bother me. The inconsistency, I gather, is that the TARDIS ought to explain the language. But, honestly, and I hope people can try to relate here, Time Lords did expect their TARDISes to be operated by fully trained Time Lords - not children and certainly not aliens. So they would be expected to know the language and, in fact, they would not design a vessel that could be used by a lesser civilization (yes, they thought of non time travelling species as less than themselves) - so it makes perfect sense to keep the language for G-Freyans only.

As for Old Gallifreyan, the language could raise and destroy empires, so that one should be kept away from all sorts of non-pacifist species for as long as possible.",0,1350664923,null,0,false,0,c6ovapd,t3_11qjx6,t1_c6ovapd,t3_11qjx6,null,1430189472,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Given the constantly changing nature of this show, I would not hold too fast onto this idea.

Sometimes it is to make small changes that allow for continuity, such as regeneration limits, and other times it is outright sacrilege.

Moreover, I believe that there is sufficient evidence that the limit was socially invented to constrict Time Lords from becoming immortal and pursuing godlike status and power over Time Lord society, and the universe itself. In terms of physiology, I would say there is also evidence that the Time Lords could start and direct the process of regeneration (although once it started they could not stop it until the healing or rebirth was complete). That explains how the 10th had enough energy to heal himself from a Dalek blast and why a much greater wound, such as the pain the 9th went through, require a full-on rebirth.

Seriously: you've got some kind of job lined up so that's better than nothing. Try getting some bar work on nights you're not working the garage (may fit in with the shifts tolerably well and is likely to lead to more work). If you've got any experience of bar work at all (or are likely to be any good at it) then: legwork. Shave, haircut, clean clothes, do NOT look for adverts, instead get around town and ask in every bar. Don't look desperate. Smile, joke, laugh, be friendly to the existing bar staff whether they're the manager or not, and when they say ""no"" ask if they've heard of anything going elsewhere. 

I never had a short term temporary cash in hand bar job that didn't lead to more work. And before you know it you'll have plenty of people to go drinking with.

edit: when looking for bar work: stone cold sober, either lunchtime or beginning of evening shift when it's quiet. Avoid big chain pubs with recruitment procedures and all that bollocks, at least at first. A little local's what you need. If you turn up to ask for jobs when they're busy you might as well wear an ""I'm a dickhead"" hat. 

God I'm full of shit today but FWIW: don't say ""do you know anywhere that's hiring"" because the answer's probably ""no"". Instead say ""where would you suggest looking for work"".

It sounds like you've gotten your immediate plan figured out, my advice for the short term is to get yourself into a new routine as fast as possible. Having a job is best but something to keep you focused on and it'll give you a much better chance of moving forwards. The biggest thing you're going to have to face is depression, finding someone to talk things through will generally help; face to face is usually best but over the phone is still a lot better than via text.

In my head at the moment, each player is ""the Doctor"" - each in their own timeline, all trying to get to end of game first. Depending on the cards, you might play as the battled hardened (9th) who is technically adept (10th) and wears a +1 Fez (11th).

So the challenge is coming up with at least one adjective each that uniquely describes 9,10 and 11 gives me 3 of 5 ""Races"".  The remainder could represent all incarnations, or additional descriptors of any of the three. 

Classes might be archetypes and the skills attributed to them. For example, the Wizard Class gets the ability of Flight (discard 3 cards for +1 each to run) and Charm (discard hand to charm instead of fight). Without changing the existing mechanics, I need something similar to this into a Doctor Who universe. (Charming, maybe?). The next part would be to explain why some items are unique or excluded from the charming or why certain monsters dislike. 

So for races, 4 or 5 adjectives that define 9,10 and 11. Then 4 archetypes to representing the classes. Its almost like I need one of those giant link diagrams on the wall you see in detective shows.

So I suppose if you're massively rich it could make sense to pay it off in one lump sum.

However, if you're not massively rich, it's better to just pay the minimum from what I understand (9% of your paycheque) as most people will never actually pay it all back fully.

true,MyNameisDon_,null,null,"I think changes is the wrong word.  Sexuality is often too simplified, which makes this discussion somewhat difficult.  Sexuality is fundamentally a part of your identity and i'd say it grows, rather than changes.

A sunflower seed grows into a sunflower and whilst the sunflower and the seed are different, there was no point at which the seed could have grown into say... a cucumber.  By the way, the plants don't represent any specific sexualities.

Also, having sex with men doesn't even mean someone's gay, perhaps they are bisexual.  And just because someone's bisexual, it doesn't mean they want to pursue relationships with both genders.  Someone might enjoy sex with both genders, but only want to form long term relationships with one.  Maybe someone has different levels of attraction for men and women, maybe there are times when a guy who usually prefers having sex with women may want to have sex with a man everyone once in a while, whilst still predominantly being attracted to women.  Maybe there's even a guy who has sex with men 90% of the time, but there's a certain type of girl he's also attracted to.

So, I don't think if Nick Griffin would have any point stopped being either gay or straight, but if he did have sex with men at the very least he expresses some tendency towards bisexuality and if so it's highly likely that those desires still exist even if he is still in a commited relationship with his wife.

First off, the tour is worth it and very cool to see the behind the scenes if you are a big fan. They take you around the stadium, to the pitch, locker rooms, and press rooms. Tour convienently ends in the gift shop, : )

Second, if you want to actually go to the game, you need to become a member of the team via the chelsea website. This process takes some time so I would do it now. It took about 7-9 days for them to recognize my membership. Once that happens you can go to their own ticket exchange site [viagogo.com](http://www.viagogo.com) . Purchase a ticket from there and pick it up at will call on game day. Highly recommend going early to pick up tickets, then go to a pub near by for pre game. 

All of the pubs near the bridge are fans only, some might require a ticket but most will let you in if you are rocking some chelsea gear.

Sorry if this inaccurate for those that live in England, but this was my experience as an American seeing a game at the bridge and crossing it off my bucket list.

FYI I was a Scout (in more than one section) as a boy¹ and have been a leader for many years (but stopped due to other commitments) and know several current leaders in Scouts and Guides (as well as a few adults running other youth groups).

Leaders are just people with a passion [mostly] to aid young children, youths and young adults to grow well. Yes there are mountain leader qualifications, first-aid, climbing quals and such but there's no reason someone outside the Scouts can't take such courses if they wish; of course they likely don't have to legally/for POR-like purposes. Most cub nights I lead were put on for less than a couple of quid of material expenses, and maybe 2 hours prep.

I've done activities focussed on fulfilling the spiritual requirements of Cub badges and been involved in those on camp and such.

&gt;*But scouting is so much more than that, as you might expect from over a hundred years of generating what essentially amounts to a curriculum of learning.* //

There's the issue though. That gamut of learning has always had a spiritual element to it [in the UK] based in monotheism.

In the scene you're talking about, Romana isn't regenerating, she's just ""trying on"" several regenerations before settling on one. This has some sort-of precedent, when the Time Lords tell the Second Doctor he can have his pick of a number of faces for his next regeneration.

If I'm remembering correctly, when the Doctor asks Romana how she can do that, she replies with something along the lines of ""You should have paid more attention in school.""

* Get out and away from the base. It'd be easy to spend your whole time there, but the further you go, the more British things will be.

* The Suffolk coast is wonderful. Not always good January, granted, especially as daylight is at a premium (you'll be as far north as Calgary...). However, get out and about on your days off, because the coast can be as beautiful on a frosty morning as it is in warm sunshine. Shingle Street on a cold January day is my favourite, in a very bleak way...

* Cambridge isn't far away, nor Norwich or Colchester. All historic locations and tourist destinations in their own right, definitely worth a visit. There's also Dedham Vale, aka Constable Country.

* I'm led to believe you'll get this hammered into you on arrival, but *be careful* driving, and please don't do it when overly tired, let alone drunk.

Based upon the information and backgrounds I have been given, combined with my own personal experiences, I have made a conclusion and I am sure that it is reasonable.

If I was going to draw upon my own prejudices and assumptions however, then I would have to assume that the culture within the PR department of Virgin is similar to my own working place. The main parallel I have to draw is that when dealing with more than parties, especially when there is a public element, then it is paramount that you chose not only your battles, but also your sides. If Virgin felt compelled to give a statement, which being one of the involved parties would automatically mean that it is not neutral, then I would have to say that being on the side of the MP would be much more beneficial. The goings on in the political world, especially when it comes to tendering of major franchises, is far from transparent. Where the influences and what are tipping points are shrouded in mystery. If one were to err on the caution, the the side would be with the MP with potential gravity, than with a relatively unknown journalist.

Then you'd surely want actual evidence to form a belief on, rather than hearsay of what someone says they heard on a train. But it seems to me that in your next sentence that you're drawing conclusions not based on fact (there are none) but on prejudice.

In my opinion you can't say you have a ""reasonable degree of accuracy"" when there isn't any evidence. It's one person's hearsay vs. one company's press release, that isn't evidence. 

&gt; If I was going to draw upon my own prejudices and assumptions however, then I would have to assume that the culture within the PR department of Virgin is similar to my own working place. The main parallel I have to draw is that when dealing with more than parties, especially when there is a public element, then it is paramount that you chose not only your battles, but also your sides.

Can't argue with that.

&gt;  If Virgin felt compelled to give a statement, which being one of the involved parties would automatically mean that it is not neutral, then I would have to say that being on the side of the MP would be much more beneficial. The goings on in the political world, especially when it comes to tendering of major franchises, is far from transparent. Where the influences and what are tipping points are shrouded in mystery. If one were to err on the caution, the the side would be with the MP with potential gravity, than with a relatively unknown journalist.

If such decisions as multi billion pound rail franchises are decided on the basis of making a politician (who is not the primary decision maker for rail franchising) pay up, then I despair for this country. With the way things are going Osborne might not be anywhere near Downing Street if/when a long term franchise is awarded.

I would argue that a ""unknown journalist"" has everything to play for here. A ""scoop"" of Osborne being stereotypically ""do you know who I am"" is very timely given the problems with the now ex Chief Whip and his pleb-tourettes. It would make a name for herself.

So It was quite an odd interview ( for me anyway), extremely informal (as in they asked one formalized question and were very chatty and more interested in my interested than experience) which if I had prepared for an informal chatty interview I would have been fine with but I'd prepped for a formal interview which meant I felt over dressed and over prepped haha ( granted there was no notification that this would be informal )

I seem to be over thinking the interview in hindsight (doing that thing where you think over everything you said and did, wondering if it reflected badly) but they talked A LOT, it was a lot of them telling me what would be expected of me if I got the job. The formal question was 'Why do you want to work for us?' Which I had rehearsed and they congratulated me on a good answer for  it which  led into them talking and talking which mean I had to interject and use twist the convo so I could use a few more of my prepped answers which were plays on the companies values and my experience in customer facing positions, I didn't ever get stumped for an answer and they never asked anything which was vague which was a big plus but the informality had thrown me so I was a little more nervous haha.

Hopefully I should find out in the next two weeks whether I get the position which will mean I'd be fully employed for two months =] So at the moment I'll be living in hope!

You may be sick of the attacks on the tories, personally I am sick of the whining of right wingers who seem to believe they should be immune from the kind of criticism which they are all too ready to dish out when they find themselves in opposition.",0,1350688416,null,0,false,0,c6p1fwi,t3_11r0ub,t1_c6p1fwi,t1_c6p17iy,null,1430192434,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I can only relate to one of those things, and I don't prray but yeah I've never electively electrocuted my head to 'make myself better' nor have I ever all given up on my CIA job and taken up a veg garden because BP is a thing you turn on and off, and in the meantime you are well enough to be a fucking schoolteacher, and nobody chastises you for being mad as a box of cats and says - mental person? Yeah, do this school job, you'll be fine!

Anyways, I think I've probably dithered off my point, which is, I LIKE timeteam, and I dislike the shit channel4 has made recently. So, yeah, fuck you channel 4.

You have the completely subjective opinion 'Jarvis gets annoying fast'. But then, you can't just post an opinion, you need to back it up. So it's preceded by ""I've seen Pulp live"".

&gt;No it isn't. Atheism is the ***lack*** of belief in ***any*** deity...

So what if a guy came up to us and said ""What are your religous beliefs?""  
You would say ""I don't have any."" and I would say ""I think religions are all bullshit."" Am I not a gnostic atheist then?

&gt;Their agenda is clearly to make the two positions somehow equal, when they are nothing of the sort.

I'm not saying atheism is a religion, I'm just saying it is a religious belief (a belief regarding religion). Just like 0 doesn't have value, but it is still a value - it's nothing like any other number (try dividing 0 and then dividing by 0) but it's still a number.

&gt;One side is making extraordinary claims and the other side is merely saying, ""that's nonsense!""

There are guides all over google and youtube on how to put it together. There are also several pre selected parts guides about, if you don't know a lot about parts yet. 

Building one yourself will save you a lot of money. For instance the PC I built for myself cost about £500, I f I was to go to a shop and buy it prebuilt it would cost me around £1000. A lot of computer shops know that anyone who buys a pre built likely still thinks that PC's are still mega expensive, which they are not.

I order my parts from scan.co.uk. Great service, fast delivery, cheap prices and they even replaced my headset when the microphone stopped working a year after purchase.

Hello Zombies!

The time for invasion is drawing ever closer with only 31 days until the apocalypse begins.

As most of you already know, the walk for 2012 was originally called off due to rogue elements of zombie imposters infiltrating the ranks and causing unnecessary havoc. There were a number of things that happened along the way that was not in the spirit of the walk at all and we felt that we were unable to continue without addressing these issues.

With this in mind, we at Zombie HQ have been beavering away to bring you a bigger, better and ultimately safer event with some new and exciting things planned for this years festivities. We have been speaking with the non-deads at the council, working with the Police as well, and it has been a long year of zombie related headaches! However, we are nearly there and now we need YOUR help!

Firstly, we need helpers on the day - stewards! You will still be a zombie! You may even get a hi-viz! We rely on volunteer stewards every year to ensure the zombie rabble are marauding together in the vaguely accurate direction, as well as ensuring none of you are taken out by pesky cars and buses - these vehicles, when used correctly, can remove the head or destroy the brain. However, with every year there are more successful infections and the annual steward team is just too small to cope with the size of the invasion! If you are interested in being involved in this way then please either PM myself, Justin Typowriter or email us on bristolzombiewalk@gmail.com and we will get back to you with more information. 

Secondly, this is YOUR walk. It can not, and would not, exist without all of you (and you all rock, by the way). We need you to keep a watchful eye on zombie imposters and convert them to the true way of the zombie! Or, they are to be cast out to be dealt with by the hungry stewards and or/Police. If you see a situation starting, or someone acting dangerously or excessively stupidly etc then the easiest way of dealing with them is for you and your fellow zombies to surround them, call them out, draw attention to them. The walk is about fun (and BRRRAAAIIINSSS) and we want to keep it that way. We want to continue for years to come but the responsibility of that lies with all of us.

Thirdly - and this is bit we all hate - all of what we are having to do to keep the council happy, and to make the event something special, is costing a lot of money. The council are providing some financial backing but it is not enough. So we are asking you to donate a bit of money to the cause. Every extra quid means an extra bit of awesome. It doesn't need to be a lot - hell, if everyone gave a quid we'd be able to put on a hell of a show! We have a paypal account especially at bristolzombiewalk@gmail.com - and if you 'gift' it, then we don't lose loads of it to fees.

Sorry for the essay post but it all needed saying, I'm afraid!

We will be releasing further information relating to the walk and related activities closer to the time (it will be a little earlier this year) but for now all you need to know is this...

It seems as though the media hasn't built this match up as it should be ( I am in the U.S. so I could be wrong), so I'm going to do it right. AVB sees Chelsea come to the Lane with fire in his eyes. He's been saying that its just 3 points, but everyone and their mother know this means much more to him. Beating Chelsea at the Lane today doesn't necessarily give him vindication but it certainly will put a sour fucking taste in the mouths of Abramovich and all Chelsea supporters. They look at him as the man that almost destroyed their club, while RDM came to be their savior which hurt his reputation even more. Don't forget about the players as well. They fought hard all of last season only to see their achievement ripped away in what was the most gutting of moments. If I ever were to be a fly, I would want to be in the Spurs locker room before they take the pitch. The only thing this match is missing is Scotty Parker. If he were out there today, he would make sure we win by pure fucking willpower. This is my third season as a Spurs supporter and god dammit it's in my fucking blood!! It's hard to remember a time when I wanted to win so badly. I want to see the disgust on RDM's face when he has to shake AVB's hand after our victory and I can't wait to see AVB's most epic fist pump come after we score; it will probably set off an earthquake. I can't stop typing because I can't stop describing what I want to happen. It's our time to shine and its time for AVB to get some fucking respect!!! COME ON YOU SPURS!!!!!!

The real question is whether they should be allowed to say that they don't accept gay students in the first place.  I think it's entirely appropriate to apply a higher level of legal protection to children than to adults, so I would say that schools should *not* be allowed to discriminate the same way as businesses in general.  The fact that children are involved, and the fact that even private schools are a public service (I think that most - or all - of them still even have charitable status) means that the level of freedom I would advocate for private businesses should not apply to schools.

Do check out the agencies in the area, I ended up in a company called Bradley Glass, it was quite boring but the pay was decent, the company took the better workers off of the agency payroll after 3 months and paid them well.

No. You're conflating opinions about religion with beliefs about god/s, but they're completely separate things. It's perfectly possible to believe in god/s and still consider all religions to be bullshit; just as it's also possible to be an atheist and consider religions necessary and/or generally good. Atheism and agnosticism both speak to beliefs about the existence of god/s, not the qualities of religions.

&gt;I'm not saying atheism is a religion, I'm just saying it is a religious belief…

I understood what you were saying the first time you wrote it, but I disagree.  If I came to you and said, *""my left big toenail is divine! And, from now on, the worship of it shall be known as nailism.""* Would you agree with me if I then suggested your *lack* of belief in my left big toenail was itself a belief *about* nailism – equivalent to *my* belief in its divinity? Of course you wouldn't, you would think such a suggestion preposterous… just like I think yours is!

&gt;That's more than just ""I don't have an opinion"", it's ""I have the opinion that your belief is nonsense!""

This is not free fuel. It takes energy to turn CO2 in the air into liquid hydrocarbon fuel. That energy comes from the electricity grid.  This is just a way of storing the energy that goes into this process. 

It's a transformation of energy, not a source of it. It's a battery, basically. It has the advantage that it works with a lot of existing infrastructure (i.e. petrol engines) and petrol is a very compact store of energy.

But it needs to be evaluated against other forms of energy storage. If it's significantly less efficient, then it's never going to be more than a niche.

I think you may be generalizing a bit too much. The concept of them sending people back in time is one of big reasons why I find them scary and creepy; I know plenty of people who feel the same. That's thing about fear, it can be about anything. 

While I admit the skills of the actors and production team are awesome and they help the general creepiness...I wouldn't say it's only because of them that people are scared of the Angels.

The boards often give you a good place to start though. I tend to put around £500 in each share I buy and specifically go for high risk/reward small cap oil exploration/production shares. 

The key for me is finding shares with a much higher upside to the downside with multiple opportunities to increase value, typically I'll buy companies that have the potential to go to at least ten times the current value if successful.

Another tactic I use is to buy into companies months before they are about to drill and the share price is low and then sell out just before they get results as many people pile their money in to gamble on the result, this often doubles your money without the risks. 

I think Rockhopper is cheap at the moment, but could take a while to turn around, if I was looking for a 5 year investment I would have it in my portfolio, but can think of better plays for the short/mid term. I currently have Xcite Energy, Tower Resources, New World Oil and Gas and SacOil and hopefully looking to get another two or three before Xmas as a few shares I like keep sinking in price and I'm waiting for them to bottom out. My time frame for holding what I have is around 6-12 months but I believe in this time frame they will either be worth multiple amounts (some could be up to ten times or more if their drills are successful) what they are or could drop by around up to 50% in value.

true,tangled_foot,uk,The Toon,"If I was king this is what I'd do, invest heavily in tidal power, power stations like [seagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaGen) generate about 1.5MW for about 16 hours a day, a typical coal powerstation generates 500MW, there are literally thousands of locations in the UK where these could be placed, and that is with the current generation of technology, there is no reason we couldn't be seeing 5MW+ seagens in the future. For comparison on shore wind turbines produce 1.5-2.5MW of power each and off shore wind turbines produce 3-5MW. Tidal power needs narrow inlets, we has a shit load of narrow inlets.

Peak Electricity usage in the UK is 60GW, currently 5GW of that comes from wind, there is loads more scope for building off shore windfarms and if you include tidal I can't see a reason why we couldn't get up to 30GW of renewable energy within a few decades, and that's not even accounting for developments in technology.

We currently get 70% of our power from gas and coal, I would start now replacing coal with nuclear, and then eventually replace gas with renewables. Once we're in a position where we're just using nuclear and renewables we can then just work to up renewables while reducing nuclear, that's a much simpler position to be in, get everyone to put solar panels on their roofs and you can top up power that way very easily.

While I can't seem to uncover any particular aspect of regeneration that should make it impossible, my guess would be that the method of preserving the hand may have had some effect on the efficacy of the unorthodox technique employed by the doctor in his regeneration.  Furthermore, it has been hinted at several times that regeneration is not always a perfect process, which could result in physical deformation (such as not regenerating with two hands to begin with) and so would not guarantee that he would successfully regrow it.  

So while it might be technically possible for him to ""game the system"" in order to keep his appearance, it would be a very risky, painful, and elaborate procedure.  Not to mention the possibility that he has limited regenerations, and that would essentially be forcing one of them to be used up.  He probably would not be too keen on the idea.

I think a bigger question would be, why wouldn't he do it for the ability to semi-clone himself?  When Donna later touched the hand, it created a version of the Doctor who shared some of Donna's personality.  It seems like this would be a much more exploitable benefit to the plan than simply retaining his physical appearance.  If nothing else, it could be a method of storing some of that regeneration energy for later use.  It might even be a way around the idea of limited regenerations, although such a thing has already been hinted at in the past as well.",0,1350736354,null,0,false,0,c6p8acx,t3_11sm24,t1_c6p8acx,t3_11sm24,null,1430195735,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

They're not doing anything especially ground breaking science wise, they're planning on commercialising a process, but so far have only built what sounds like a lab size test rig. There's no talk about whether its economically feasible, and this is the stumbling block for implementing a technology.

They ""solve"" the problem of transmitting renewable energy from remote locations to mobile cars, but only with a process that is very inefficient. A petrol engine is at best 35% efficient but transmitting electricity is &gt;90% efficient as are electric motors and batteries. So even before the efficiency of their production technique, they're proposing a method with half the efficiency.

In fact assuming they're production technique is 100% efficient the cost of renewable-petrol will be at least as much as mineral-petrol. Widespread adoption would put considerable pressure on the UK's electricity generation, to generate our petrol would take something like 40,000 wind turbines. That would probably require offshore wind turbines which would push up the cost to twice the current price of petrol.

100% efficiency is impossible, but even getting close to that is ridiculously optimistic. A few years ago I worked for a company that had a carbon capture test rig. It was used to assess which process would be the most effective - and cost efficient. The energy required to extract CO2 (from flue gas) was not insignificant, a scaled version would knock percentage points off a power stations efficiency. Capturing CO2 from air avoids some of the problems caused by other chemicals present in flue gas, but is more energy intensive, and this is just to get one of the ingredients for their process.

Missing Terry is a big deal if not only because of organization, we got lost at the back in the first bit of the second half. Torres played well except when he had chances at goal. Sturridge got his goal but looked pretty poor otherwise. I think RDM needs to say to him, look, you and Torres are all I've got so you'll definitely get time, but you need to be a team player like Torres is. Sturridge is definitely going to be more selfish than Torres and take some shots, which is a good thing, but we don't need someone who won't pass either.  
  
Overall a solid performance by most, barring some lapses of judgment in the back, and Mata is simply amazing. Hazard hasn't looked great recently, but even then he looks better than most.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Gallas really lost us that game - Chelsea's first two goals came off bad clearances from Gallas. Their third goal came off Gallas' terrible positional awareness. They almost had a fourth from his lack of positional awareness. 

Once we shift Vertonghen back into the center our defense will be fantastic. With Kaboul back, I really think we'll have the best defense in the league.

Our defense, specifically Gallas and Walker, really let us down today. The first half we were terrible, and I really think that taking Huddlestone off was a bad idea. Livermore did a good job defending but once we lost Huddlestone we lost our distribution from the center. 

I was impressed with Livermore's play, but we can't play with two CDMs, it makes us too defensive. When we were attacking Chelsea we exposed them for how overrated they really are. Defoe muscling Ivanovic off the ball and shoving his way around Luiz and Cahill shows how superior we were for ~20 minutes. We couldn't keep it up, though, and moving to a more defensive formation made us unable to recover. 

I think that al things considered we did quite well. There's no doubt in my mind that we would have beaten Chelsea had we had Dembele and Bale. Not even BAE or Kaboul, just those two.

I'm really frustrated with these terrible announcers, though. The way they're talking about this match is like Spurs were really outmatched and Chelsea are already champions. Their first half performance really was much better than us but second half, for the most part, we were on top. 

I really think Chelsea will have a serious crash after December, so I'm waiting for that haha. I really don't think Di Matteo can hold them together. 

I also think AVB is doing a good job by putting more focus on Defoe. Ade has been really lackluster every chance he's gotten. Defoe seems to be passing more often than he used to so that's good, too.

All in all, it's a shame we didn't come out with at least a point this match. Gallas has worn out his welcome and we really missed Bale and Dembele today.

In practise, the council needs to run with the 20mph zones they've created, and the ones they're going to roll out, by narrowing the lanes so it's safer and more comfortable for motorists to drive at 20 rather than 30. This should be done by narrowing lanes in each direction by about 20%, adding on-street parking in alternating directions (with the intent of developing shallow bends on otherwise straight roads, to wrap around the bulges of the street parked cars), and delineating lanes for cyclists with closely-packed rumble strips across junctions (so cars can still cross the lanes, and exceptional vehicles can straddle them), and larger angled raised chevrons than deflect straying cars back into the flow of traffic.

There is no doubt already that for most part of the city centre, it is significantly faster for people to ride a bicycle (doubly so once you factor in parking). The problem is it is unsafe and unpleasant for cyclists to do so.

In tandem to this, off-bus payments (like an Oyster card) *really* need to be deployed. Riding a bus needs to be so simple, an Oyster card linked to a direct debit makes too much sense.
