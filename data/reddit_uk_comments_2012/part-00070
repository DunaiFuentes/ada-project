Exactly! It gives me such a headache trying to figure out how they even got together when she's the one who tipped him off that they were something at all (in her first appearance in the library) but in a much later episode she says that when she first met him, he knew everything about her. (Because their timelines are running opposite.) So WHERE THE HELL DID IT START? If they both only knew each other because the other one had come to them at their respective beginnings/ends of the relationship, how did this even happen, and why didn't she just stay with him and travel and be part of his timeline when she decided she wanted to be with him? It doesn't have to be this complicated.

I loved Rose though. She humanized the Doctor in a way that was so necessary, although it killed me that he was never able (really) to tell her what was so obvious to the viewers - that he loved her more than just about anything.

But saying 'The writing is shit!' is not really a smart, or valid, argument. I think you're giving in to well when you say he's being refreshing and intelligent :p. He says nothing to actually back up his claim except reiterate how 'shitty' the writing has become, when it really isn't. The writing isn't 'crap', it doesn't appeal to him, and therefor he thinks it's bad.

Asserting your subject viewpoint and claiming it as objective is not a valid argument. And, as a note to all of this, I'd say that the writing in Who has been better than it's been in a long time. From an objective viewpoint that Moffat does a good job, generally, for foreshadowing the story as well as laying the groundwork for future plot points. One of the worst things about RTD, in my opinion, was his overuse of deus ex machina for endings. The day would be saved by things that were literally brought up 5 minutes before the ending. That's simply not good writing, and shouldn't be applauded.

From a subjective viewpoint, I just enjoy the stories. They're fun, engaging, and often leave me excited for the next one. And I notice this with a lot of other people, which is also why Doctor Who has been catching more and more steam as of late. Moffat doesn't weigh the show down with the unnecessaries. For example of how RTD always kept Rose connected with her mom and family life. I personally found this unnecessary, and gave us one too many episodes that just took place in present time London. Vampires of Venice is a perfect example of the opposite of this. Moffat wanted to address Amy running off the day before her wedding due to cold feet, but he didn't let that turn into an episode where they go back home. Instead he has The Doctor take them to Venice for a 'pre-honeymoon' of sorts to help them sort things out. No need to have an episode that is spent 60% in Amy's house while she talks to Rory there.

Hmm..I got on way more than I planned, but yeah. *That's* why I love Moffat, both objectively and subjectively. Notice I never just stated,""OMG, RTD IS RETARDED AND A SHITTY WRITER!""

Oh, and no orphanages in the US?  Please cite that ""fact"", because here's a list of dozens of orphanages in the US: http://www.missionfinder.org/orphanages/

What I've learned is that while the high security prisons are adequately hard on prisoners, that's not where most offenders end up. The small time drug offenders, or people who've got in a fight or whatever, are sent to a low security prison where they can leave the prison on day trips, earn money, come out for weekends, etc. 

My dads observations suggests that most offenders treat these low security prisons as just a quick holiday with free TV food and heating. No attempt is made to rehabilitate them, so when they leave there's nothing stopping them from re-offending. This is in contrast to my dad who, starting at a maximum security prison, has worked his way through the system over the years and has, in my opinion, *earned* those little bits of freedom. 

If short term offenders were locked in a maximum security prison for a month or two, it'd likely scare them to shit. The reality is that what they get is that akin to a holiday inn. ",0,1339234210,null,0,false,0,c4y9kxm,t3_usxm0,t1_c4y9kxm,t3_usxm0,null,1429102791,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

Far from ""exile"", what the proposals actually say is that the specific visa type known as the ""family visa"" will only be granted to foreign nationals when their British sponsor has a certain level of income, and their English is of a certain level. Once you look at the issue in those terms a much more sensible debate can be had.

In the new cases created where the foreign national in question would now be ineligible for a family visa, they are still perfectly able to attempt to settle in the UK via one of the many other types of visa available. If they are ineligible for any type of visa, then it means that their British partner has been deemed unable to support them financially (or that their English is not of an acceptable standard), they don't have the education or skills that would make them eligible for a skilled worker visa, and they are unable to find an employer willing to sponsor them. It's now up to detractors of this plan to argue why such a person should be allowed to settle in the UK.

Yes, it's fucking horrible that she got raped, but blaming the bus driver for not forgiving 20p off her fare or the other passengers for not helping out is just ridiculous. People who are denied boarding a bus at 3AM do _not_ get systematically raped: they find another way home or wait it out, which is precisely what the victim was trying to do when she got assaulted. She was just terribly unlucky. 

If we're going to hold the bus driver and the other passengers morally responsible, we might as well be outraged at every single instance of someone being denied boarding for being short of a ticket: *""Something terrible might happen to them! How can people be so callous!?""* 

Well what if the terrible thing happens at the destination and not the origin of travel?

Also think back to ""The God Complex"". Rory did not have a room. He was the only character they made a point to say did not have one. And when the Doctor looked into his room all he said was ""Of course it was you."" and we hear the wailing of the TARDIS distress call in 4 repetitions. The only other time it has made this sound was when The Master stole it in series 3.

EDIT: Found some more evidence. 

* Rory showed no surprise to the TARDIS being bigger on the inside.  This is invariably the first thing that people tend to be shocked by.

* Rory’s daughter, River Song, is half-Time Lord.  I was always a bit suspicious about the explanation that it was because she was conceived in the TARDIS during midflight through the Time Vortex.  As many characters made a point of mentioning, it really isn’t that easy to make a Time Lord.

* Finally, we never really got a good explanation as to how the cracks in the skin of the universe formed.  We know they are closely related to Amy Pond.  We know Rory is also.  The Master was presumed dead, how else would he get back?

London wise, Camden is a definate must.  Stay away from the touristy market bit, but go see a gig in the Underworld (beneath the worlds end pub).  I've seen some absolutely cracking gigs there.

Other than that, come up north!  Spend a good few days walking in the Lakes or the Pennines.  Again, don't go for the obvious touristy places like Windermere, just pick a little place on a map and have a bit of a wander - I assure you it's (mostly) beautiful.  You can't really go wrong with the national parks, just be prepared for dismal weather.

Lastly, on the note of frugality, learn how pubs work.  You'll be spending a lot of your time in them, and even if you don't drink much (or at all), it's worth discovering what costs how much, and where.  It's all too common that you can spend a night drinking in one place, and be charged over double for the exact same thing somewhere else.  If in doubt, ask a Brit - we'll be all too happy to give you a lecture on exactly what we're drinking and why.

* Rory is not the only human who hasn't been surprised by the TARDIS being bigger on the inside. Dr. Grace Holloway wasn't surprised by it either. Some people are more unfazeable than others.

* Rory's died and come back. Never regenerated.

* Rory's the one in the show who doesn't have faith, not that he doesn't have fears. 
   It's much more likely that the Doctor encountered himself in his room in ""The  
   God Complex"". Both the Dream Lord from series 5, and the Valeyard from 
   season 23 are manifestations of the Doctor's dark side, and are something he 
    truly seems to fear. Also, the ""TARDIS distress signal"" is the Cloister bell and
    it's heard all the freaking time, any time the TARDIS is in danger. Think of it as
    the equivalent to the Enterprise's red alert klaxon.

*  The next time you end up in Nazi Germany with one of your best friends turning  
    into your long lost daughter after she's pulled a gun on another good friend, and 
    been shot by frickin' Hitler, you get back to me on whether it would give you a 
    headache, k?

*   River Song isn't part Time Lord. She's a human being with mutated DNA that 
    shares some, but by no means all, physical characteristics of Time Lords. The
    exposure to the vortex seems to be adequate to explain that similarity. 

*   I think the person is reaching on this last one. The cracks in the universe really
    don't need to be related to Rory at all. 

If you want to explore this more in depth, it's been covered time and time again on this subreddit. Just do a search in the search bar to the right for the terms ""Rory Williams"" and ""Master"". User Jimmysilverrims has the most detailed reasoning about it, but I think he's probably sick to death of talking about it at this point.

My girlfriend is Taiwanese. She speaks perfect English. She has a PhD. She is hard-working, intelligent and an incredible asset to this country.

It's also harder for her to find jobs because of work permit/visa issues which costs businesses more money to hire her than it would to hire an EU/UK citizen. I'm not hating on immigration or EU citizens - I just think that the discrimination against non-EU citizens is bullshit. How is it fair that to keep my Taiwanese g/f here I would need to earn £27k/yr, but if I was dating a Polish girl, I can be unemployed? And according to the article, the burden is on the UK citizen. The way I interpreted it, a non-EU citizen could be earning £100k/yr, but if the UK citizen is earning less than £27k, they could still be asked to leave.

Who gives a shit where people are from? I only care about whether they are a benefit to the country or not. This is massively discriminatory and may have the opposite effect of what is intended.

That makes sense. I guess a vast majority of Star Wars fans are no longer Star Wars fans because they hated the prequels.

Not that I'm comparing to Smith and Moffat Who to the prequels, that would be an egregious comparison.

Look, it took me a while to get used to the new Who. The last two years changed the look and feel of the show almost entirely. It felt weird to me, because it moved the show into a place that was closer to the scifi I normally watch, a bit darker, more serialized, and a bangin' hot redhead to boot. But it didn't feel like Doctor Who. It feels VERY different. I wasn't sure what to think about it, but I gradually accepted it and learned to love it. But I didn't get into Doctor Who until this past year on Netflix. So I'm not as attached to it as some. But I can see how a much older fan would dislike it because it doesn't feel like Doctor Who. I can also see older fans not minding because they were used to constant creative changes over the original run. People shouldn't just blindly accept what they see on their screen because it's labelled as Doctor Who. Sometimes shows get shitty. And some people think this show is now shitty. They don't cease being Doctor Who fans because they have differing tastes than the current audience. Stop qualifying fans, that's really juvenile. Just let people watch the show and have their own fucking opinion.

But it doesn't.

Employers can also ""objectively justify"" a ""proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"" with regards to indirect discrimination - see [Section 19](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/19). Your example would be indirect discrimination as the protected characteristic is race (incorporating nationality), not visa status - other people of the same nationality but with the right to work in the UK wouldn't be discriminated against.

My point is there must have been some evidence of her dementia. Hell, even a doctor's note. If the bank had been informed of her condition there is no way they would have proceeded with the application.

My point is why not have both but in the logical order where we can have both, instead having two carriers with just the F35B or one carrier just with the F35C... Im saying have one carrier with the F35B (which is still estimated to be ready sooner than the CATS + F35C would otherwise be) and the second with the CATS &amp; French navy (who use their rafale) and eventually the inclusion of our own F35C. 

Both France and Britain will have effectively have a carrier strike capability of two each however at much lower cost.

true,_River_Song_,river,River,"I came up with this theory based on the filming pictures: Graveyard, Rory not there, New York, Amy walking towards an Angel with the Doctor shouting 'NO!!', so these might be real spoilers.... 

My theory about episode 5:
The big 3 visit new york in the 1930's (or whenever that newspaper was from) when they run into some trouble with the weeping angels. Rory is sent through time, and the Doctor and Amy don't know when to. They call River to help. 
Eventually, they find Rory's gravestone. The Doctor can't go back and save him as this would cause a paradox (if Rory doesn't live his entire life in the past, they will never find the gravestone). The weeping angel that sent Rory back appears again, and Amy, in her despair at losing Rory, touches the angel so she is sent through time to the same place as Rory. 
Neither Amy or Rory technically die, and get to live their lives together in the past/future.

You're probably right, that the taste element is psychological.  It's like when you cook for yourself, it always seems to taste better.

Personally, I use insecticides and fertiliser.  But what I also have is complete control over when a plant is harvested, and when it is, it's normally eaten within the hour.  So perhaps the freshness brings something to the flavour?  Also, supermarkets standardise their sizes, whereas as a home grower, I can pick the young sweet leaves whilst also allowing the plant to grow and mature.

I don't have a large garden, but the beauty comes in maximising what little you have.  When I was a student, I always had pots with Capsicum or Jalapeño on the windowsill.   Now it's Onion, Garlic, Lettuce and Spring Onion, with Tomato indoors.

You say you have a patio; that's all you need.  Get some pots and plant up some seedlings (which are very cheap).  You'll have harvests before you know, and so much, you'll be giving it away to friends.  Plants are easy to look after; sunlight (face them south in North Europe), water (when needed, don't overwater - better to have a wilted plant than a drowned plant), and a little food.  Then all you need to do is protect them and talk to them :)

As a starter, I'd pot up a few lettuces if I were you.  They look after themselves, grow fast, enjoy containers and provide immense satisfaction when you're munching on them in a salad.

I can even understand that sometimes people are just stupid and they commit a crime, or they get caught doing something which doesn't really harm others.

But let's be honest - anybody getting into double digits of previous convictions (i.e. not just suspicion, questioning or arrests but actual convictions) has had more than a couple of run-ins with the law. It's a pattern of behaviour which needs to be broken. Either by punishment, their removal from society, or by ""curing""/rehabilitating them to not be scumbags any more.

And when that number is so massive.. 44% of people convicted of an offence already have &gt;15 others, there is a SERIOUS problem. It's not just a few one-offs. 90% of people convicted or a crime already have previous convictions. That represents habitual re-offending by a certain population of people. It's a minority of people causing a HUGE amount of crime through repetitive behaviour. I wonder how much total crime in the UK would drop if all of those re-offending didn't re-offend any more. Seems to me that there are many new criminals, or one-off criminals. It's a minority who cause many crimes each. For the good of the public and the country, those people need to be dealt with one way or another. Either rehabilitate them or lock them up.

I also strongly believe that Austerity is a mechanism used to ensure that workers of most layers are kept quiet, stressed, fearful, complicit and demobilised. 

I further strongly believe that Austerity is method that has been used to reduce worker benefits/decrease workers conditions (pensions, pay-rises, bonuses, hours etc) and undoing a good ~40 years of socially beneficial worker conditions improvements. 

For me, all of this points to Austerity simply being a cover for socially regressive practises. 'They' knew it wouldn't work, but it is being deployed to deliver the idealistic reforms of the fiscally right, and traditionally ""anti-welfare"" center-right governments. 

This view comes from working the public sector in two different countries for the past ~10 years. And having watched, read, and experienced 'Austerity' affect my work, my team, my department and the two countries I have lived in.

Your argument (and the EDL argument) just has a massive fallacy at the heart of it. 

The Islamic texts  do include some troubling concepts (are you sure you actually read the Bible?!)- and a very, very small group of Muslims in Britain adhere to those concepts- therefore we should get rid of Islam and all Muslims. 

I mean, that is essentially your argument. We should get rid of this fantastically interesting religion which advocates for giving, whose members do amazing aid work, which has given so much to art, history, mathematics and which will continue to give more. There are a few bits which trouble you (and for some insane reason you think it's going to destroy the whole of western civilisation) and therefore adios Islam! 

Wouldn't it be better to confront the few who practise those things instead of a blanket attack on Islam. 

What you're doing is blaming the whole for the faults of a few- a method which, historically, isn't fruitful. 

And, (here we go), let's go with this fiction you have created and say that all Muslims believe in the awful religion you have painted. Is it really the best course of action to just destroy the religion- to act without equality and tolerance in mind? - shouldn't we, as English people, hell as citizens of a western world united in its love of fundamental freedoms, seek to teach these people about our principles and show people how good they are? No, no, better do as you advocate- destroy the religion, deport the people who believe in it. You are no better than the 'monsters' you create. 

And, of course you are permitted to have a point of view- this is Reddit after all. But given the fallacy above, and my knowledge (based on your reply) that you have a number of brain cells to rub together my only deduction is that the argument you are espousing isn't really your argument. And then I think: why would you actually want to get rid of these people/this religion? And the only other logical answer is: you are racist. 

England is, and always has been, a sanctuary for people of all religions, creeds and cultures. A place where fundamental freedoms are sacrosanct. That is the way of life we need to protect. Getting rid of a whole religion and group of believers is impractical, impossible and contrary to our way of life.

And let's not forget Saudi Arabia where there are Islamic police enforcing harsh dress codes for women in public and where they are lashed for wearing trousers.

As someone who is currently going through the process, 'most likely' is an exaggeration. Either you happen to be qualified for one of the 'shortage' occupations or you find a job that can't be filled by a settled person.

Right now the easiest route is via higher education, if you can get the loan and can stand paying off the debt; in addition it gives you enough time for your partner to qualify for permanent settlement, unless they extend the probationary period to five years as suggested in the Guardian article.

In order, they are: The Masque of Mandragora, The Hand of Fear, The Deadly Assassin, The Face Of Evil, The Robots of Death, and The Talons of Weng-Chiang.

(Even though it’s actually the concluding episode of Season 13, I nevertheless include The Seeds of Doom at the beginning of this list mostly because it was my first real exposure to an entire Doctor Who story from start to finish.  Part 3 of The Deadly Assassin was the first-ever Tom Baker episode I ever saw, and Part 3 of The Talons of Weng-Chiang was the second-ever Tom Baker episode I ever saw.  So, yeah.  There’s a definite attachment to the stories of this particular season.  I usually end up recommending these seven stories, in order, to anyone who’s only ever been exposed to post-2005 Doctor Who and is ready to delve into the “classic” series.  

Think of it: You get Tom Baker at his absolute peak, Sarah Jane reaching the end of her travels and Leela beginning hers, a rare visit to Gallifrey and a confrontation with the Master, two “present-day” adventures, two distant-future civilizations, one entirely alien world, and two period dramas.  The Philip Hinchcliffe era is widely regarded as a transitional period in the show’s history, when it pretty much ceased to be a children’s show and started tackling slightly harsher themes.  The running theme of this particular season: enslavement and the abdication of free will.)

When SOME people go to a new country they adapt. There are problems with integration and ghettoisation based on race, religion or culture amongst immigrants. That is a result of multiculturalism.

&gt;I don't understand your concept of integration- do you want every middle eastern immigrant to immediately sit in the pub with you on a friday night watching football and having a few beers?

Obviously not. Integration to me means immigrants speaking the country's language, mixing with others, becoming active in the community and groups outside of their own culture. (Obviously lots of immigrants do but there are clearly still huge issues)

There are some things we view as traditional English values that are still true; fair play, hard work, honesty etc but there are others which have evolved from how they were in the past- acceptance of homosexuals, women's rights etc. Some other cultures aren't as accepting of these values as others.

Edinburgh is a great university, many people would kill for a place there.

In northern europe it is often associated with loss of inhibitions, rowdiness, violence etc yet in some other cultures it is associated with relaxation, calm and sleepiness and not loss of inhibitions and the very idea of rowdiness and booze is not a familiar one.

true,kateorade,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"Keep in mind that everybody's got their own preferences and you're likely to get ten different answers from ten different people.  Also, if you're going to watch Classic Who, then watch the episodes as they were meant to be originally presented: in 30/45 minute intervals, not all at once.  That way you get to fully appreciate the cliffhangers.  c:  Anyway, here are my personal prefs.

Inferno:  The Doctor gets stuck in an alternate universe where everybody's evil!  It's quite long, but I love it to bits and it's got great acting all across the board.  It's such a wonderful story.

The Three Doctors: This is the best multi-Doctor episode/special/whatever out there.  I'm serious.  Two and Three are HILARIOUS and you've got one of the better villains of the series: Omega.  There's glorious Time Lord bickering and a completely stellar script.

Horror of Fang Rock: First off, I have such a girlcrush on Leela and this is one of the better of the serials she's in.  Second, this is such a good serial with good pacing and one of, in my opinion, the best cliffhangers in the show's history.  For most of the story it's a murder mystery with some sci-fi thrown in, instead of ridiculous sci-fi all around.  It makes a nice change from some of the rest of Four's era.  Plus, I wrote on it for a paper so I just have wonderful huggy feelings towards this serial.

Kinda: Kinda is terrifying-a lot more terrifying than some of Moffat's stuff.  It's a commentary on British imperialism, but it has great scenery, a smashing script and Janet Fielding is scary as shit.

The Black Guardian trilogy (Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, Enlightenment):  I just really like Turlough.  And even though Terminus is not a very good serial, I recommend it anyway just because it's bookended by two awesomely wonderful serials.

The Mark of the Rani: One of the things I absolutely hate about the new series is the lack of Time Lord interactions.  This has the Sixth Doctor, the Master and the Rani all trying to screw up each others plans, overacting wonderfully and just generally being completely horrible people to each other.  It's one of the better episodes out of Six's weak tenure and has a wonderful multi Time Lord dynamic.",0,1339309792,null,0,false,0,c4yln0t,t3_ut6aq,t1_c4yln0t,t3_ut6aq,null,1429108545,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

For a club like Chelsea which has to compete in various leagues, put in order between various pro to rookie players, sign new talent, build and develop a team and above all that make sure the building team stays at a reasonable rank is a tough task. De Matteo might be up for it, but might not be that skilled to do things simultaneously as of now.

Sorry, I know this isn't /r/design, but typefaces are almost like colors for me; I have a hard time not noticing them.

**EDIT:** I'd drop the ""FM"" from the frequency, too. What we consider the ""FM band"" tops out around 108 MHz or so (though FM refers the the way the radio signal is modulated to encode audio signals; it's been just appropriated as the name for that frequency band).

But still, I imagine you could take practically any person who can drive a car and fully train them up to be a bus driver in a month.   Compare that to any kind of profession that requires, as a minimum, a degree taking anything upwards of 3 years to complete and it starts to look pretty insignificant.

Your point about on-the-job experience is valid, but that's not unique to bus drivers.  A doctor, for example, will undertake a 5 year degree and then 2 years further in foundation training on-the-job before they can call themselves fully qualified.  7 years is a ""fuckton"" of training.  With respect, I don't consider a month to be in the same league.

In summary, I don't mean to disrespect the bus drivers themselves, but I have no respect at all for the opportunistic unions seeking to line their own pockets at our expense by holding the Olympics to ransom.

""Under government criteria, a troubled family is one that meets five out of seven criteria: having a low income, no one in the family who is working, poor housing, parents who have no qualifications, where the mother has a mental health problem, one parent has a long-standing illness or disability, and where the family is unable to afford basics, including food and clothes. Many of the seven are beyond the control of the families themselves.""

Is a bizarre definition of a 'troubled' family,and it is not exclusive to this:

""""fluent in social work"" and are responsible for chaos that costs the country £9bn every year. He wants fewer children playing truant, life-long benefit claimants on the road to employment, and fewer police call-outs to problem homes.""

I appreciate that families meeting some of those criteria are more likely to have social problems, I see it all the time where I live. However I still find the definition odd, if it included a percentage of police call outs, criminal convictions or cautions, truancy rates of children in the household, references to children leaving school without qualifications etc it would be more fitting with what Pickles wants to achieve. Also families is not just one address, it is the product of several generations all living in different addresses, intervention needs to happen for the entire family. 

Plus realistically, if the opportunities are not there for people who do have qualifications and want to work and improve their lives, what are the chances for people who have lived their life on benefits and think that is the way to go. If the councils are given incentives to help/coerce/persuade these families into changing their ways by what criteria do they then set to show they have helped them? Is it a percentage of improvement in all criteria met by the family? Defined by a number of changes to each individual household or by each family? As I mentioned above if the families have been causing trouble for generations, they are now in a number of different households, is an improvement in one defined as an improvement for the whole family? 

You can't give councils incentives to improve and then not set criteria with which to measure it. Otherwise it is playing lip service to the problem.

""Councils will receive £3,900 for achieving at least 85 per cent attendance in schools among these families, a 60 per cent reduction in anti-social behaviour and a cut of a third in youth offending. Getting one adult in the family off benefits and into work for three months would net the council £4,000.""

That is some of it, but the criteria of what a troubled family is in the first instance is odd,I could potentially fit 4 of the criteria myself! And it doesn't define family as in one household or as multi-household. Plus into work for 3 months is so not worth 4K, enabling that person to become employable for a lot longer is worth it. But it seems like a box ticking exercise so the govt can say "" we did this and the council have done that it works aren't we great"".

&gt; Anyway, this idea isn't perfect, but I can understand where it's coming from. It's not simply to lower crime rates, but rather to improve quality of life in those 'troubled' families, but encouraging them towards better educations, employment etc. I'm not convinced this is all entirely achievable, though, even in the best case scenario. There simply aren't enough jobs available.

Totally agree.

Society is not some organisation existing to serve the needs of its members. Society is a naturally forming/occurring grouping.

true,ratatooie,null,null,"OK a couple of points. I am not explicitly arguing for a blanket ban. I am not sure that that would stop the idiots, but it would (and has) reduced them. I remember when you could smoke on buses for example, then after the smoking ban came in (in Scotland) it was very very unusual to smell smoke. Sure you get it occasionally, but I can count the times since the ban came in on one hand, and I travel daily. 

Lets take a look at your argument and some of the things that are banned on public transport. Having sex. 

""A few people abuse the system. Make it illegal!

Here in Germany, various cities are taking steps to ban having sex on public transport. Hamburg just recently banned it. Berlin is fighting against a ban, because the transport system can't afford the extra cost of enforcing the law.

The thing is that banning having sex on public transport won't stop horny pricks being horny pricks. But it will stop me from having a wank on my way home from work. I accept that a whiff of semen might be mildly annoying to another passenger, but probably less so than a sweaty person or someone wearing too much aftershave.

Whether I have my penis in my hand or not has little to do with how annoying I am to other passengers. They may not like it, but I don't see why they have the right to be offended by something so small. They may also not like tattoos, 2 men holding hands, tourists speaking loudly or other stuff, but they don't have any right to complain about them.

I'd love to see people playing shitty music on their phones fined, but I'm not going to tell them to stop, because I'm not the kind of dickhead that insists on regulating others because I face a very, very, very, very, very tiny annoyance.

If something is really disturbing your quality of life, then I support you in your attempt to change it. But making a rule that says that I'm not allowed to quietly wank harms my freedom without addressing the cuntishness that exists regardless.""

Now we have huge parts of the population paying high rents, unable to save or buy a property. When they retire there is no asset, no private pension and a state pension unable to cover the cost of rent, let alone to live off.

Renting as a way of life isn't that bad as an idea, however when mortgage payments are rents are pretty much the same, rights for tenants limited, combined with a lack of housing, is not a healthy foundation.

People that spend so much of their income on housing be it mortgage or rental payments is severely damaging the economy as disposable income is decreased and the jobs this spending creates vanish. Simply put, we need more houses.

With so many unemployed and such a large housing crisis, it astounds me why we don't build more. Councils are sat on huge banks of land, houses cost very little to construct - there is no reason why we couldn't start building houses on a grand scale tomorrow.

It's a cultural thing that people born under those circumstances feel hopeless, aspire to nothing, and therefore achieve nothing. Britain is still a pretty free country, and there are plenty of opportunities for people to better themselves. Everybody gets basic necessities like housing, free education and free healthcare taken care of. There's nothing *actually* stopping most children born on a council estate from doing well at school, going to college, getting into university etc. I know that many have family problems etc, but a lot of it is simply down to poor self-esteem, low self-worth and no aspiration. They may have the same ability as anyone else, and there's nothing actually stopping them.. school and college are free and open to all. It's just cultural that those families don't go to school, don't try hard, and don't aspire to get a job etc. And it's not surprising. If their parents didn't attend school and don't work, it's expected that their children won't either. Not to mention peer pressure, and seeing everyone around you doing the exact same thing. I think those people need help - they need encouragement to go to school. They need to be given the self-esteem and feelings of aspiration to drive them to achieve something, rather than just sitting at home and hanging out in bus stops with their mates.

As for rich people being idle or hard-working, I don't really care. As taxpayers under this system we have a vested interest in other people looking after themselves. If somebody inherits a trust fund and doesn't work, they aren't affecting anybody else. Whereas families claiming benefits ARE affecting others. If we are going to have a system with a welfare state, then this is always going to be the case. It's the nature of the system.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"On education, I've mixed feelings.  Preventing your child from accessing the best opportunity to learn and develop critical thinking skills seems a form of abuse to me, but there's a fine line between learning and being propagandised, which having things like a core curriculum probably cross.  Not to mention the very nature of school learning is often highly coercive and detrimental to free-thinking - what is it with schools and bells? Almost bloody Pavlovian! Indeed there are studies which show an inverse relationship between number of years in State education and ability to think laterally/creatively/see large numbers of alternatives).  But I don't think _anyone_ should take a child out of school unless they are both competent and prepared to put in the work themselves to a high standard or have found another avenue which puts the child's needs for independent competency first.

On work/jobs, the problem with your view is it ignores the options which have been taken from us by industrial capitalism.  In previous times people were much more reluctant to work for another because they could either work for themselves or stay home and be self-sufficient.  It may have been a fairly miserable existence (truth be told, all life in the middle-ages was pretty miserable unless you were a feudal aristocrat), but it was a choice they had and one they often took.  Indeed, it was such a popular choice that the bringers of industrialisation had to use the State and criminal sanctions and land theft and all sorts of other mechanisms to coerce them out of it (for the ""good of society"" and to ""promote efficient use of resources"" and other bullshit reasons).  Indeed, the workhouses and poor laws which we seem to be drifting back towards, were instituted for that very purpose (to coerce labour for factories when people didn't want to work there, much of it child labour of course).  Welfare has been a partial reversion to the time prior to this, when people were less strongly coerced to work for the master/lord/factory owner.

true,b-e-n-d-e-r-bender,null,null,"I think that the younger players at LFC (Sterling, Suso, Morgan, Coady, Flanno, Robinson) are in a difficult spot. On one hand, all would gain considerably from a season loan to another PL club where they will be a starter in 80-90% of the matches. On the other hand, LFC is competing on 4 fronts this year (PL, FA Cup, League Cup, Europa League) and needs a large squad. Young players would surely feature in many of the competitions, especially against weaker sides. However, as LFC progresses further into these competitions and the stakes get higher, youngsters will be left off the team sheet in favor of the more senior and more experienced players, which means they miss out on game time against the biggest sides. Playing for another PL team would see our young players get time against the likes of United, City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.

So I guess I am a bit undecided as to the best way to foster the development of some of these young stars. It might come down to money...promoting young talent keeps the wage bill down and saves money on transfers. But I'm not entirely convinced it's the best way for all of them to grow.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt;  Britain is still a pretty free country, and there are plenty of opportunities for people to better themselves. …  There's nothing actually stopping most children born on a council estate from doing well at school, going to college, getting into university etc.

That's pretty much a complete denial of the facts. 

If you're born in the wealthiest 20% demographic in this country, you're 4x as likely to graduate university than if you're born in the poorest 20%. [I can easily find more cites, but [this one](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/may/22/social-mobility-data-charts#) has pretty pictures and digestible soundbites]

And looking at the 20% ""extremes"" is not really so useful when we're talking about the impoverished groups being targeted here - it's the poorest 1% or 5% to whom politicians and *The Daily Mail* are constantly ascribing blame.

The chances are that if you're born poor, you're going to live your whole life poor, that if you're born rich then you're never going to know the same kind of struggles. 

&gt; If somebody inherits a trust fund and doesn't work, they aren't affecting anybody else.

And that's complete bollocks. Wealth inequality is a zero sum game, as is wealth, really. Those idle rich are depriving other people of wealth, because you say it's ""fair"" and it's ok for them to do so.

You say ""they should have to work for a living"" only when it suits you, and without really examining things. *""It's the nature of the system""* and *""it'll always be the case""* - sure, if we don't question or change things it will be. Society is constructed the way it is because it suits us that way - or rather because it suits those in power. You're just playing into their hands.

Apparently the food is good for the first 2 weeks then everyone gets sick of it and ends up living off noodles and take aways, something you don't really want to do if you're already paying for dinner. I didn't want to go because I like cooking myself. It's where the majority of the rich kids are so a lot of ""Pollocks"" get slagged off, and when you find out someone dead on lives in Pollock, they get a lot of condolences. That being said, I know a lad from Belfast that was in Pollock and he liked it. It's proper halls as well like Elms in Belfast, the whole dorm room thing.

I lived in Sciennes. It wasn't one of my choices (so many students ended up with no accommodation and were looking for their own, and I was only told about a week and a half before I moved that I got places in Sciennes... it was a shanty town, not gonna lie. It was good craic, though a lot of the people weren't very social, it's all down to luck.

I forget what I actually put as first preference but Beaver Bank is in the back arse of no where so wouldn't recommend that really. Sciennes was good in that it's right beside the Meadows (big park everyone drinks and BBQs in when it's sunny) which you just have to cut through to get to the campus. 

The halls are all over Edinburgh, it's not like Queens that there's a wee village which is a bit of a bummer.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Under a state-run system, you're always going to need set standards, examinations, timetables, targets and league tables. Otherwise you can't control standards, or have any sort of system at all.

Interestingly enough, that's kind of what the Finnish education system is like.  They focus very heavily on child-centred education with the teachers as respected professionals, minimal bureaucracy, more cooperative than competitive, only teacher-set tests rather than exams, good local democratic control etc., and they consistently come out very respectably on international comparisons.

&gt;My own opinion would be to privatise schools entirely and allow more free-reign of teachers and parents over education, but I'm sure that idea would be hated on reddit.

To me, it depends mostly on what you mean by privatise!  But I'm no fan of the State, obviously.

&gt;We need basic literacy, basic numeracy and a knowledge of history, humanities and science as a standard. After that, specialise to your hearts content.

Literacy and numeracy seem pretty uncontroversial - though _how_ you teach them may be (certainly the talk/chalk approach is altogether too authoritarian for my tastes, and I'm not sure how effective it is beyond the very basics, it certainly doesn't facilitate original thinking).  Science could be a little more open to controversy (though I'd hope reddit might be a bit less prone to some of the wilder ones).  Humanities and history though, here's where we get in to a thoroughly political arena.  For example, my children, to date, have had three versions of history put to them - that from a British curriculum international school, that from a local Vietnamese school, and that I've given to them myself.  I hope the triangulation approach, together with a strong foundation in critical thinking, will serve them well, but it does show that history is far from apolitical, even when it strives to be.  A conservative American observer would certainly see their Vietnamese history as pure propaganda, a communist Vietnamese observer would see their British curriculum studies in much the same light, and both would probably think my encouragement to them to question everything they're told and ask themselves why the person presents the ideas that they do in the manner that they do is less than satisfactory.  Either they'll end up messed up or extremely well-placed to judge different perspectives on history, I obviously hope the latter!",0,1339338529,null,0,false,0,c4yoh0t,t3_uud5z,t1_c4yoh0t,t1_c4yo68d,null,1429109944,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The process of applying for a place takes around two weeks before we know if we have somewhere and is quite expensive. 

Actually finding a place is difficult in and of itself, as a lot of landlords seem to be putting their flats up for rent to see what sort of price they can get rather than actually wanting to rent to someone. Either that, or the 'available on' date is a lie. Perhaps it's just us, however. Several weeks of viewings and everything we liked we failed to get.

All in all, we're in a situation where my partner will be homeless for three weeks before we can move in to a new place, and we still don't know if we've actually got it, despite being able to pay six months rent up-front and assuming all the risk. The rental market is a landlord's market at the moment - they can do whatever they like because everyone has to rent. Every property has massive amounts of interest and landlords hold out for a bidding war.

As for notice, I have never heard of anyone getting two months notice. One month's notice from the landlord seems pretty standard. My partner's landlord has decided to sell the flat, so did give us first refusal at least. They also did not give notice that agents were going to visit the flat, or of maintenance.

These very same stats and box ticking that the govt want more of! She was off long-term sick, I wont go into details, but despite letters from the consultant himself the LEA still were not happy because they could not ascribe a long term condition to her and put her in that box. 

She has just passed her first year of a Diploma in Animal Care and Management with a distinction, and is due to go back in Sept.  :-)

any way my point is i believe that even if you are raised under a low income it is ultimately up to the individuals who choose how to live their lives. this is how i feel personally, i concede there are different situation for different people though but i just wanted my opinion known.

The current rampant inflation is largely being created on purpose in order to help all the 'homeowners' that have borrowed more money than they can afford and keep them in their over valued houses.  They did this in the 70's until house prices fell back in line with wages and it worked a treat.  Sadly this time around globalisation will mean that the wage rises they need to achieve this are not going to happen. 

Also because property prices have an impact on the cost of everything as not only does a shopkeeper have to cover his rent, the business rates are based on the rental value, which is based on the price.

So these housebuilders can build houses, and need to sell them to make money. At any one time, an individual housebuilder will have millions worth of housing stock waiting to be bought.

If they suddenly start producing more houses because of increased demands, their individual returns actually go down because their portfolios of property would go down.

The ways around this would be a) housing coops where people who don't have the means or expertise individually can band together or b) the government acting as the housing coop, by borrowing the money which they can do very cheaply, building houses to fulfil and supply and sell / rent them onto tenants to cover the loan repayments.

Unfortunately a) is a bit of a pipe dream because now most people don't tend to either know the people they live around that well (e.g. we have stronger nuclear families and weaker 'extended' networks), also you might not want to stay in a business relationship with someone you don't know that well for 20 years.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"Because no one would buy them. Part of the reason that house buying is a lack of market demand; high prices and a reluctance of banks to lend to people with small deposits is preventing many first time buyers getting onto the market, and a lack of first time buyers at the bottom causes the whole market to slow down.

Now the obvious solution is to pop the bubble and make house prices crash to affordable levels, but that would be a case of cure being worse then the disease.

A crash in values wipes out peoples retirement funds, it puts people into negative equity, leaves people paying massive mortgages on properties suddenly worth no where near as much. In short, it gives our already flat-lining economy a kick in the balls. 

Negative equity can also lock people into their properties, even if they want to sell-up and move. If your house is suddenly worth a lot less then when your bought it, selling it might not give you enough back to pay off the mortgage. 

Like any problem which has been building for this length of time, the solution can't be delivered quickly. It's best to try and let air out of the bubble slowly, as we're seeing. House prices are largely flat, with inflation steadily eroding them. 

The downside of this is why we're waiting for first-time buyers to build up the deposits needed to secure mortgages, the resulting slow-down in the market reduces the demand for house building, which in turn pushes up rental prices as the population grows.",0,1339347507,null,0,false,0,c4yq05b,t3_uufcv,t1_c4yq05b,t1_c4ynlry,null,1429110793,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you are older, own two properties already and have a nice passive rental income, then its much less significant if you have to pay for some big repairs.

true,rabidmonkey1,null,null,"&gt;Look at what I quoted from you. You are advocating the exclusion of the submission, not on the basis of the content, but on the basis of its origins.

Yes. For the most part, nothing but anti-religious bigotry, hatred, and shallow, self-aggrandizing bile comes out of r/atheism. My comment was based in weariness in dealing with this level of ""content"" on reddit in general, and having it leak out into other subs.

&gt;The fact that in many places atheism is a minority, and your opinion common, hardly strengthens your argument. 

/r/atheism does not equal atheism in the world. False equivalence.

&gt;It seems like you might be in a minority here though, as the submission has done quite well.

Appeal to authority. So a mass of people liked it? That has no bearing on it's truth. (You would think that this would be a concept an atheist could understand).

&gt;I am glad to use the term 'hate-speech' if it made you consider for even a moment, what you were saying.

Well, it didn't, because of where you drew your water from. In other words, you have no credibility to accuse others of hate-speech when the well you're drinking from is literally made of nothing but hate-speech. 

The only parallel I can think of is[ Dave Chappel's blind racist sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i9iTYe6tEk), where he plays a black KKK member. 

And it's hilarious because you're so blind, you can't see your lack of credibility or authority on the matter.

It'd be different if you were someone akin to an MLK Jr., now; someone who lived and practiced peace and love. But let's be honest; if you're reposting from r/atheism, all you're doing is marinating in hate-speech. 

&gt;Atheists are one of the most distrusted groups in the US, and you are now generalising about them inappropriatly, and unkindly. 

No, I'm generalizing about them honestly, and with nearly 5 years of experience interacting with the folks over there. I've never once had a positive, let alone honest or open, interaction with someone from r/atheism.

I mean, does anyone even take it seriously any more? Half the posts in this ""bastion of reason"" are just facebook screencaps these days... 

&gt;If you want to head into /r/atheism and debate your point then I am sure you will find some quite reasonable discussion to be had about it

Reason? From r/atheism?! HA! That place is quite possibly the most dogmatic, hyperbolic, downright unreasonable place on the planet. 

But again, I literally think you're blind to this point.

Quite simply, what got me with this post is the insinuation inherent to your post that you need to somehow give credence to the ideas of atheism in order to enjoy Doctor Who - when in reality, as I've explained in other comments, this is the farthest thing from the truth; that Doctor Who is literally riddled with religious (and particularly Christian) themes, ideas and symbolism.

No pressure then.

&gt;Fernando Torres is in. He is through on goal. This is his chance. But he is hesitant and Gianluigi Buffon comes out to meet him and beat him to the ball as the striker looks to go round.

Very generous here. It's obvious that Torres should score *every* chance he gets.

What a fuck up Torres is. Throwing away this golden opportunity.

&gt;Oh Fernando. You're having a bit of a mare. Torres is given space again near the Italian goal and tries a chip from the edge of the area but it drifts over the bar. His hands go to his head. We've seen that pose way too often in the last 18 months.

If the live text is anything to go by, he's been playing for TWELVE minutes now and whilst he hasn't scored, he's apparently made three amazing chances in the limited time he's been on the pitch. We could focus on the positive impact he's had on the Spain side that wasn't fielding a striker but I suppose it's much easier to focus on Torres not being perfect.

&gt;Fernando Torres gives away possession again with a poor pass as he looks to find Andres Iniesta. That could be Spain's last chance gone...

If only Torres didn't ruin their last chance. Spain had 90 minutes to win but forget it. Torres made a poor pass. They're out of chances now. What a fool. 


Maybe I'm just reading in to that all a little bit too much but it does seem ridiculous to me. The guy can't catch a break. Obviously I didn't see the game so maybe the BBC feed has oversold it but it seems to me that he was doing a lot of good things and just didn't manage to finish them off. Sounds like he could've done a lot more if he was playing the full game.

Europe in the most part has already used those bullets if it is already using QE. Britain has already made £30bn available to the IMF too, which coincidentally is pretty much exactly the entire amount of capital it is now being reported that the Spanish banks need.

Of course Spain's players are more talented, but they were the wrong type of player. It's no coincidence Spain suddenly created a few more chances once Navas came on to stretch the play from one side, and they introduced a focal point for their attack - had that focal point not been a low-on-confidence Torres, they would have won.

The same thing happened against Switzerland in the World Cup - Iniesta &amp; Silva both cutting in from the flanks. Man City had the same problem this season with Silva &amp; Nasri at times. So far, Rodgers seems to favour having one 'pure' winger, so here's hoping that continues at Liverpool.

I bought my first flat in 2000 in Herts for £95K, sold it two years later and made £27K. Nice. Used it as a deposit on a house in Cheshire, which was worth about £125K, cost me basically £100k. Just so you know.

The mortgage costs me, currently, £224 a month, thats pretty cheap. 

I met a girl, and moved in with her. I rented out my house, I get £525 a month. The cost of the maintenance, and some fairly serious work that needed doing over the last few years means I have made £1900 in total in rent over 5 years. (New chimney stack, boiler, electrics, flooring, wiped me out). Also I pay a lot in insurance, rental fees to agents, maintenance costs, and a few other bits. Its not making me money!

Thats fine though, the property will creep up in value eventually and i might pay off the mortgage. 

The hardest thing is the tenants. Tenants are often a nightmare. I cant tell you how stressful it is to have bad tenants. The recent batch, who i have been trying to evict for 3 months  (nearly there) have caused so many problems, I am going to have to pay thousands to restore the house. 

Its a vicious circle really, I dont want to be a landlord, but I cant sell without losing a packet, tenants (generally) dont respect properties. I know some do, but never as much as the owner would like, and they think we make a fortune. Some landlords do, but not me. 

So anyway, no real point to this, but there are a lot of people like me who got a house just before it all went tits up about 10 years ago, met someone and rented out their house and its not all that great. I feel like I'm sort of contributing to the whole mess really, and its not that easy to get out of.

Very few teams risk playing such a high defensive line against Spain, and Italy caused them loads of problems by doing so, despite Spain effectively playing with a 6 man midfield. Whilst going forward, Italy did leave themselves very vulnerable to counters several times, with their back four being dragged out of position too often, but without a real number 9 to play on to, Spain couldn't convert those opportunities. When Torres finally came on, he just looked dreadful and failed to put away several shots that he would have just smashed 3 years ago.

A player that really surprised me was Mario Balotelli. While his disciplinary record often consists of stupid, pointless fouls, he tracked back aggressively and stifled Spain's transitions (an area where they are typically unparalleled).

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"It's not denial of the facts at all. The link is full of correlations but doesn't address causation at all. The biggest problem isn't wealth or lack of it, it's the attitudes and culture that come along with wealth or poverty. That has a much bigger impact than finances do.

The link also said that 80% of the top 20% expect their children to go to Uni, compared to only 44% of the bottom 20%. It's aspirations and attitudes, just as much as finances that matter.

School is free. College is free too. And so is University in practical terms (since you get a loan, which you repay later when you are earning). The thing which ACTUALLY stops poor people going and doing well is their defeatist attitude, low self esteem, low self worth and low aspirations. If you've seen your parents sitting at home jobless, and all your mates hanging out at the bus station, you aren't going to dream about becoming a doctor. Whereas a child with both parents in successful careers will want to achieve the same thing. That's not about wealth. Plus, children at either end face peer pressure. Kids on council estates see everybody around them on the dole or working crappy jobs. And it's hard to be the ""swot"" in your class or you get bullied. Wealthier kids grow up seeing their neighbours with nice houses and nice cars, and so they want the same things. And their parents will pressure them to do their homework, to get work experience, to go to university. Whereas (and pardon the stereotyping) a lot of the bottom 20% of parents don't care much about their kids, and won't push them in the same way. Neither of those things have anything to do with wealth itself - it's about aspirations and expectations set by parents and peers. Strictly speaking, there's no reason that a bottom 20% parent can't encourage their child in the same way and give them higher hopes. They just don't.

If we want to help people, we need to target attitudes rather than just concentrating on finances. I don't believe that the bottom 20% would change significantly if we just gave them more money. It's about much more than just bank balance and income.

As for the wealthy, I don't see how idle rich people are depriving others of wealth at all. They're spending their money on stuff - like cars, expensive hobbies etc. And they'll still be contributing a lot of tax through VAT on everything they buy, capital gains on investments, stamp duty on the expensive house they buy, astronomical council tax on their nice house etc etc etc.",0,1339363947,null,0,false,0,c4ytgpq,t3_uud5z,t1_c4ytgpq,t1_c4yo6g3,null,1429112317,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Why does the state owe prisoners board and lodging? They're not slaves they're incarcerated because they've been convicted of serious enough crimes.

Like I said such action will not deprive the exchequer of taxation of wages nor deprive anyone of a job because without such labour being used the job will not exist and no one will be paid to do it. There may be a few refuse workers lost but more labour would be used in administrating the work and watching over prisoners + providing skilled input.

Here's one about face proportions: http://maiaspaintings.blogspot.ca/2009/11/human-face-drawing-face-proportions.html  

Look a few of these up. There are also vids on youtube.  

When you don't frame something out, you frequently end up with odd proportions because you're focused on the small details. The fine detail areas look great when you're tunnel visioned into that spot, but things look a little strange or off when you zoom out and see the whole picture.

I suppose for me the anguish of the tenant/landlord situation is more about the fact that there is often a massive dichotomy in the distribution of wealth. Property is a reasonably secure investment, especially over the long term - it is 'easy' for the rich to get richer. 

With that situation on living in my friends place, I never meant to suggest I ever felt resentful or anything of paying him the money - he gave me a good deal and gave me privacy for the place that became my home, I appreciated that.

true,r-cubed,null,null,"Hi there--I'm an American who went to grad school at cambridge (though I received my PhD in the states). For graduate students, it does not matter (academically) which college you attend. Your classes will be in your respective faculty. Colleges serve as accommodations and socialization for students. Now for undergraduates, it does actually matter as many of your supervisions will be held in college. While I don't know if it's universal, graduate supervisions are once again in your faculty. Basically you can sum it up for graduate students like this: all academic work proceeds at your faculty, all accommodations/food/socializing can be held at the college.

That said, I do think some colleges are better than others. I let the computer pick my college, which I later came to regret. Not that I was unhappy with my college, but it would have been nice to select one of the oldest or the ones I found most architecturally fascinating. This sort of thing I didn't really realize until I arrived in Cambridge. 

I can't say with any certainty whether certain colleges are for certain ""types"". Some colleges have a reputation for sport (say, Eddies) but it's not universal. You'll find a mix of people in EVERY college. And if you're interested in clubs or sports it's even more university-wide. As for other tips, well that's up to you. Do you want a river college/not mind being around lots of tourists? Then Johns/Trinity/Kings are up your alley. Do you like privacy? Maybe one of the colleges past the backs is up your speed. Or you could pick a college nearest to your faculty (my college was sooooo far away from my faculty, it made it incredibly tedious). 

Edit: If I could go back and pick my college, I would try for Pembroke. I loved that college. ",0,1339376503,null,0,1339376871,0,c4yw19i,t3_uv9xa,t1_c4yw19i,t3_uv9xa,null,1429113572,6,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,6

- The mathematical bridge was designed by Newton to not need any screws or bolts. One day some students took it apart in attempt to learn the structure, but couldn't put it back together. Hence all the screws/bolts

- The wedge is missing from one of the Clare College spheres because only completed structures could be taxed by the crown. Without that piece, it's unfinished and thus nontaxable. 

- Something about how you could walk to London on nothing but land owned by Johns or Trinity

- I heard variations of this whether you were a Cambridge man or an oxfordian. I can't remember it though, and it's really bugging me. Something about how a 300 year old rule on the books about how a student can request cake and beer at any time and, if not provided, they get out of the exam. The other variation I think was that a student could request to take the exam while the proctor was in armour and sword. Really fuzzy on this.

- An adventurous climber once spanned Kings College chapel and placed a road cone atop a spire. Recovery crews built a massive scaffolding system to safely retrieve the cone, but could not reach it in time. Leaving the scaffolding to finish building the following day, the wayward spiderman once again ascended the chapel, removed the cone, and placed it on the opposite side of the structure.  

- The will that gave the large tract of land to Kings required that cows always be there. If not, the land goes back to the family.

I'm from the south of Ireland (so I can't speak for the Northern Irish, understandably the situation and feelings there are more complex and I won't get into that here unless you have a specific question) and the consensus of the average person here is that our differences with England are 99% in the past and we are working on ironing out a compromise on the other 1%. By the time the kids starting school now are adults I don't think there will even be any reason to ask the question you did. Any remnants of hostile opinion will be largely historical.

We have never had a beef with the Welsh or Scottish. You will find xenophobic dickheads where ever you go in the world but now fortunately these people are in the severe minority in Ireland. If you are good natured and sociable, anyone from any part of the UK would have as warm a welcome as anyone else. I might add if you are in anyway charming, the Welsh and Scottish accents will melt the local girls hearts. Not sure why, they just dig it.

EDIT - All bets are off when it comes to international rugby matches. I'm not for England losing as such. I'd just rather any of their opponents won. Martin Johnson nearly set back UK/Irish relations 50 years when he refused to line out at the carpet on a rainy day in Dublin a few years back. Thankfully, our President turned the other cheek and walked in the muck to shake the player's hands. I seriously thought there was going to be a riot, I haven't seen much to change my opinion of the English team (and how they act around match time / play their game) as a unit since.

That tends to mean if someone is running away or disabled you cant keep brutally attacking them but you hold the right to defend yourself if being attacked.

If on the other hand we could improve detection rates from 5% to 15%, then all of a sudden the expected sentence is 1.5 years or 3 years depending on whether we're talking about 10 years or 20 years.

I don't know your kid and your relationship with her, so it's not an easy judgement call. Some 8-year-olds could watch that arc and be fine. Some will get nightmares and be scared for weeks, or more.

If you do sit and talk about it, also be aware of the spiritual questions that may arise; things like whether or not Satan is real or people can be possessed, etc. if she's already thinking elements of Dr Who are real, these ideas may also leave an impression on her. (I am not trying to start a theological discussion here btw, just a heads up from my experience in teaching that kids are sometimes looking for this kind of stuff.)

I think it's probably okay, but only based on my personal experiences. I find it less disturbing than Frollo in Hunchback of Notre Dame, which I watched at that age. Be with her and be prepared to stop it if she gets scared.

To me that suggests more that it may be dangerous or unhealthy to go beyond 13 lives (mental deterioration or something like that) moreso than simply being biologically unable to pass that number.  This would also support why the Master wanted to restart his cycle rather than just finding a way to hide the fact that he's gone past 13 from the Time Lords.  There'd be no reason to say that Time Lords couldn't regenerate after their thirteenth incarnation if they were physically incapable of it anyway.  It'd be illogical, like telling someone they couldn't keep a pet unicorn despite the fact that it would be impossible to do so anyway.

I don't necessarily think you're wrong about a biological limit existing.. I just don't think we can definitively say that it's 13.

In the classic show, it was established that if a time-travelling person touched him or herself from a different point in time, there was a huge violent and destructive burst of energy, like a huge buildup of static electricity passing between the two.  So when we see the feeble sparks between the two screwdrivers, that suggests the effect has become a lot weaker due to time and space being so much smaller than they normally are.  The scene with the two Doctors happens later, when the universe has become smaller still.

Of course, the other thing is that the Doctor might be immune to the energy discharge problem that other time travelers have -- he's met himself loads of times and never had a problem.  The fact that those were different incarnations might also have something to do with that.

The necessary-ness of each special varies, depending on what you're interested in. I'll try to give a sense of what each entails, and my recommendation on what to do with it:

1) The Next Doctor - This is a Christmas special, set in a steampunky Victorian England. Its events are briefly referenced in the first episode of Series 5, but this episode is otherwise largely optional.

2) The Planet of the Dead - The Doctor gets stuck on a desert planet with a busload of strangers; they must work together to get back to Earth in time. Not entirely necessary to watch except for the very end, which sets up the next special. So if you're planning to skip this one, let me know and I can fill you in on what is Need to Know before you go on.

3) The Waters of Mars - The Doctor comes upon a fixed point in human history, the first colony on Mars. This one is much more interesting, in my opinion, than the last couple, and shows a new side to the 10th Doctor. This understanding of the character and what happens to him in this episode are necessary towards understanding his state of mind and being for the events of...

4) The End of Time, Parts I and II - Required watching before moving on to Series 5.

true,incredibleridiculous,null,null,"Here is the perspective from a:
Brand new Spurs fan from Minnesota, U.S.A. (last season was my first)

I have really used this season to build a stable of players (both Spurs and non-Spurs) that I really like.  I watched as many games as I could between the EPL and La Liga, and mixed in some Serie A and Bundesliga into the mix.

Spurs: Modric, Van der Vaart, Adebayor, Bale, Walker, Friedel, Rose, in that order.

Non-Spurs: Ronaldo (he has been my favorite since Ronaldo of Brazil (Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima) retired), Xabi Alonso, Iniesta, Fabregas, Xavi, Messi, Robben, Ibrahimovic, Torres, Drogba (sorry, fan for a while)

Players I detest:  Ribery far and away more than anyone else, then Balotelli

Watching the Euros (I have watched every minute so far) has let me take an opportunity to understand strategy more than before.  Different approaches to the starting eleven, different national strategies for game style and how players mesh with other teammates is really fun to see.  Torres feels out of place on Chelsea, but he also feels out of place on Spain, for example.  It has also given me the opportunity to see my favorite players and not be focusing on the team, but being able to watch a player.  My first sports love is baseball, which lets you follow individual players as a part of a game even if the rest of the game is lousy, and being able to watch Modric on the field and not feel like I am ignoring the rest of Tottenham lets me get a better feel for him.  Being excited to see Van der Vaart come on late was a thrill I haven't experienced.

I look forward to every game because there is something I can pick out as a subplot in addition to winners/losers and seeing great action.  Next I look forward to England and will cheer for an embarrassment of Ribery as much as I will for an England win.  After that I get Ibrahimovic and maybe I will find some Swedes and Ukrainian players that I can get excited about.

TL;DR : I am watching the Euros for star power, great games and to get to know more players.",0,1339399638,null,0,false,0,c4z0cpi,t3_uul8t,t1_c4z0cpi,t3_uul8t,null,1429115610,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

Generally speaking living in Scotland was not a problem, most of the Scots I met and made friends with were fine with me being English apart from some banter. More specifc problems/notes: 

The ""Anyone But England"" when it comes to sport (especially football) is prevelant so it is best to keep your support muted - walking through town with an England football shirt on is not the wisest of choises. (Many pubs bar football colours entirely).

On occasion a heavily accented local was just incomprehenisble to me. (strong Dundonian is pretty strong). I also visted some friends in Glasgow and occasionally struggled although they did live in a rough area.

Speaking of rough areas - the person who picked up one of my pool balls to belt someone in the head with it dd apologise for disrupting our game. My friend and I took no offence.

A sign of a good chipshop is one that wil not deep fry you a Mars Bar. Whilst the selection of food available for deep frying is esoteric the Mars Bar seems to have disapeered.

Cairn O' Mohr wine is pretty nice stuff if you have a slightly sweet tooth (although they have dry wines as well).

Dundee is Scotlands sunniest city - and I'm sure Reykjavik is Icelands warmest city. If you do not like the weather in Scotland please wait 20 minutes.  

If you are leaving Scotland remember that in the south of England the chances of a Scottish note being honoured are not 100%.

You tried to argue about him scoring a goal against Chelsea, a goal that was eventually insignificant. 

You talked about him playing at the ACON for Senegal, who got knocked out in the group stage. 

You claim that playing half of the games in the second half of the season was a good tally, even though they were all substitutions and amounted for 113 minutes total. That's less than 1.5 full matches. 

    Now after having all of your claims debunked, you tell me to look at it positively. 

&gt;Because he is a full international for a pretty good country

One that failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2006 and 2010, knocked out at Group stages at ACON in 2008 and 2012, and did not even qualify in 2010. 

&gt;he played in the Premier League for over 3 years to a pretty good standard.

For Wigan, who have been relegation contenders for the last 3 seasons. 

&gt;He will be coming in to fill a void that was only half filled by Spearing last year, so would you rather see Diame be the cover for Lucas, or Spearing?

Spearing, since Diame will hardly be able to fill the void up to a quarter. 

&gt;Maxi and Kuyt didn't play many last season would you say either are not good players? no they fell out with there manager just as Diame did.

You are comparing a team that has multiple options practicing a squad rotation system, for two players who are over the age of 30, to a team that has a shoetring budget and minimal resources who passed up a player (both in terms of playing him and also extending his contract) who is 24 years old.

No such thing as bad publicity. 

&gt;I'm close to simply declaring you a troll and moving on.

As you wish. 

&gt;However because I suspect these convictions are a true reflection of yourself I just have to comment; I can't just walk away from this train wreck of a post because like all humans I am drawn to watching the supposed ""head roll"".

I don't do Yoga. 

&gt;You're definitely a generation X child and this comes across from your self-entitled disposition and lack of understanding that the world can't just snap into a new modern utopia in one easy bound. I can't figure out whether you took advantage of the prosperity most middle class gen Xs had in schooling, the property market, and employment or that you're bitter that you missed out upon it.

You cling well to your conditioning. Humans aren't going to ""snap"" into a different mindset. Alarmingly, human civilisation looks like is could snap (or maybe the long descent is more realistic, I am agnostic on this matter). But the humans are not going to transform their mindsets suddenly. Where did you get the idea I might think that (a rhetorical question, please don't answer)? 

EDIT: Maybe humans *could* snap into a different mindset. I don't want to dismiss the possibility altogether, but I wouldn't bet on it either. 

The sad thing is that so few people will even recognise there is a systemic problem with the current civilisation and that is is doomed to fail like all others have, that the process of failure is getting underway and may no longer be avoidable and that culture itself has indoctrinated us and created our worldviews. 

So all you can do to defend yourself is presume I fit some banal stereotype (which is maybe true, I am not sure if I qualify as gen-X). If I took advantage of bourgeois privilege or did not, either way it dismisses everything I have to say. 

Infact, if a better communicator than I put the same ideas to you in language you could understand or did not threaten your fragile ego, you'd likely agree with a lot. Sadly I am, at the very best, a window smasher and not an orator. 

&gt;I assume the former because you seem to feel that you can see the big picture and no one else can and that usually comes with those that went through school before the curriculum got rather confused at what to teach.

Mostly, you're wrong. My schooling was entirely irrelevant to me. I smelled a rat from day one and never paid attention, this system considered me a nuisance and then a failure if it considered me at all. I am an autodidact. 

&gt;That arrogance is rather offensive to be honest.

I acknowledge it's a failure. I assume you are free of any negative traits. I congratulate you. I don't feel deterred by offending. It doesn't matter. You will keep calling yourself free behind the bars of your cell and I will call you a prisoner and goad you to leave the cell. In the end we are both in a cell and the difference is that at least I know it. 

If that makes me smug, it's not much of a consolation, I am sure you'll agree. 

Being in captivity surrounded by people who just don't know it is pretty alarming though. Imagine going to the pub or a cocktail party where the guests are served bleach instead of beer or wine and you realise this while everyone else is drinking happily.

true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","I've no problem with microchipping or requiring a license.  The problem is how do you enforce it?  Responsible owners will pay to have their animals chipped, and apply for a license, but the owners who see fit to let their dogs roam loose, or just kick them out into the streets when they stop being cute puppies are not likely to go to the trouble of expense of doing so.

If puppies are born at home, how do you ensure that the owners of the bitch get them chipped as opposed to just giving them away?  If a stray/loose dog is picked up without a chip how do you locate the owner?  

There's also the usual problem of cost, enforcement will require enforcement officers, presumably provided by the local councils who are usually cash-strapped.    It costs around £20-£30 *per dog* to have it chipped.  A litter of puppies could be anything from 4 to 10 pups.  

As a dog owner, my feeling is that dogs should not be allowed to run loose on any patch of park, only in designated dog run areas, and that they should be kept on a lead at all other times when out in public.  Not doing so should incur a fine with surcharges for not having a microchip.  Those funds should then be targeted at low income owners in order to subsidise the chipping of their dogs.  Dogs that have a record of being aggressive to other pets should be muzzled at the very least, and removed from the owners care or destroyed if the owner takes no steps towards training or rehabilitation.",0,1339404712,null,0,false,0,c4z0wik,t3_uvttn,t1_c4z0wik,t1_c4z0qan,null,1429115877,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,sinjax,hampshire,Hampshire,"Wow. I love r/uk. I really have no time or patience for replying to random people on the internet in any other subreddit, but for some reason I feel compeled to clarify here :-).

Right. Given a 2 bed with a garden where I live with a 15%+ deposit my monthly payments (assuming a normal non-equity mortgage) would be in the order of £600-&gt;650 a month (assuming a 3 to 5 year fixed rate mortgage with interest of 5%.). It takes some poking and prodding but you can get these figures form here: https://mortgages.hsbc.co.uk/repayment-calculator

Now my current rent is 775. For a 1.5 bed flat with no garden. On top of this I save in the region of 150 to 300 pcm. (depending on the horrors of a given month). 

The average saving is 225, with my rent this means I spend 1000 a month on rent + savings without bills. right.

Now lets assume I just payed the mortgage and continue saving EXACTLY what I'm saving now. Keeping in mind that the only reason I'm saving now is to save for a deposit. But lets say I wanted to be very very careful and continue to save the hyper amounts im saving now even though there would be no need. Every month I'd still only be spending 825 (on mortgage and savings) or something along those lines. This means every month £175 would appear magically in my wallet which i would spend on hats.

If you spent 1600 over 6 months on repairs that is an amount my savings could consume quite happily. And of course this is all ignoring the tiny detail that when i have a mortgage I'm paying myself and a banker, and in later years mostly myself and less the banker. When I'm paying rent I'm throwing my money into a fire.

Again, you're attempting to dismiss the popularity of the royals with tourists as if it has no bearing and doesn't mean $. Not the case.

&gt;so the article makes no case regarding the actual monarchy being a draw for tourism that wouldn't come otherwise.

Actually, it does - the survery of 25,000 where the Queen came third? That's a basis for stating that the Queen is popular with tourists. From this point on, you have to demonstrate that this is not the case or provide data of your own.

&gt;More speculation based on nothing.

See above - And remember, that's just one source. It's odd that you're quite happy to ignore the info that doesn't fit what appears to be your predetermined opinion when you're so keen to demand proof. 

&gt; Regarding Buckingham Palace, people can only visit inside when there are no royals!

And yet they still visit regardless. Even before it was opened to the public.

&gt;The Tower of London is the most popular royal attraction (only the 14th most popular tourist attraction in the UK which is a damning statistic in itself)

So you're asserting that unless the royal-related sites are the top draw, the royals have no attraction? How does that logic work? And anyway the ToL is so old it will always be an attraction itself - but there are plenty of other sites you couldn't apply that rule to.

&gt;The data has been spun.

And you're not doing the same here? 25% picked a red double-decker bus - so *three-quarters* of tourists don't care about them; shall we get rid of those too?

&gt;No, you have to illustrate that the sales/sites visited wouldn't have happened without a ruling monarch

If anyone was stating that the *sole* reason these buildings were visited was because of the royals, you could reply with this. No-one is (at least, in this thread) - your position is speculation without any survery statistics of your own, and without this (again) you're applying a predetermined opinion onto information that doesn't tally and attempting to dismiss it with extremes. So, I'll ask again - you now have to illustrate how the popularity of the royals *does not* translate into sales, or that the royals are in fact not popular with tourists.

&gt;You are asking me to prove a negative

Info is placed on a website detailing how much money the royal sites bring in, and demonstrates via a survey how popular the royals are. You are asserting that the royals' popularity has nothing to do with the numbers that visit, backed up with no information of your own. I expect you probably wouldn't believe that any commonwealth visitors (or foreigners generally) came over for the Jubilee

&gt;the burden of proof lies with the monarchists saying that a ruling monarch is essential to tourism

This is where your predetermined opinion highlights your 'spin'- on what basis are you overlaying your opinion onto that of the tourists? And how do you assert that the royals being popular with tourists does not translate into $?

&gt;The burden of proof is on them to conclusively show how this is the case.

See above.

&gt;Frankly I don't care about economics. I would be happy to take a hit on tourism should it mean we can have a more equal society in terms of law, power, influence, wealth, land, and so on.

And if we hadn't landed on the moon, we'd have 100 more hospitals. It *never* works out like that, and I don't really see how the royals being present (or not) has any effect on how our society functions - there certainly wasn't any noticeable upswelling of anti-royal sentiment or apathy with the wedding last year or the Jubilee.

&gt;However, proponents of the monarchy greatly over-egg the importance the actual monarchy has on the economy.

And, it would appear, anti-monarchists greatly underplay that importance while providing no figures of their own :-)

&gt; The fact that you are citing people picking postcards shows the shaky ground you are on.

Watch until the end of the double episode ""the empty child/the doctor dances"" which is written my Steven Moffat (by far the best writer on the show).

The fact that she is a single mother and is drunk around her children unable to support them is child abuse.

I must also point out that while middle class families appear to be more nurturing to kids and not need help from social services, abuse of children is just as common, its just that middle class families tend to be better at hiding it, and the abuse tends to be more emotional.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; You don't understand a thing.

You know, patronising people is never the best way of attempting to win them over to your point of view. I've seen you do this repeatedly, over the years. Your ideas get challenged, you feel threatened, and you revert to ""Well, I'm going to patronise them"" mode, telling them that they know nothing, that they are idiots, that they believe propaganda, etc. It's not winning you any converts.

&gt; You make modern technology which puts people out of work but you then cling to an outdated idea that everyone should have a jo in order to survive.

New technologies create work as well as making older jobs obsolete. The last 30 years should have been ample demonstration of this. And really, what people want to avoid is a situation where people simply choose not to work, and end up consuming the tax revenue generated by the people that *do* work. Revenue that could be spent on health care, infrastructure, and all the other things that people expect the state to maintain. If we have a situation where there are no consequences for those that simply choose not to work, then the tax burden generated by those people becomes unsustainable. In fact, it's unsustainable *right now*.

&gt; If it's true that technology can replace labour then reconfigure society to provide people with their basic needs without any strings and let everyone be. If you don't do this, you are creating an insane system in which you eliminate jobs and then threaten people who can't find work or don't want to do the shitty work that is on offer.

These are your suppositions, and I do not agree with them, nor do I agree with your subsequent conclusions. 

&gt; How'd you figure that? The UK, for example, is now dependent on imported energy and food, has lost the skillset that came with industrialisation (which itself cruelly eliminated older skills and freedoms) and is an overpopulated island that can't provide for itself while its elites exploit the labour of profoundly poor foreigners and throw the crumbs to us.

What does any of that have to do with your proposed ""make work"" society, in which we don't dare adopt a technology if might cost someone their job? 

There are *hundreds* of jobs now which did not exist in 1800, and *would not* have existed had the Luddites got their wish. Those jobs have replaced other jobs which are now obsolete. By the sounds of it, you would have us hang on to obsolete technology to preserve obsolete jobs, which it would be entirely optional to work in. Insane.

&gt; As the fragility of this system is revealed, a hundred years or so of prosperity do not seem to suggest a winning formula.

And yet you have no sane answers. Nor does anyone else. No one invented ""the system"". It grew organically, and yet you always speak in terms of malevolent design. There *was no* malevolent designer(s). And ""The System"" you speak of has brought us far more than 100 years of prosperity. 

We are where we are, and we have to adapt what we have to meet the demands of the present and the near future. It's what people have always done. Flawed Utopian dreams that centre on reinventing society are a waste of time and effort.
