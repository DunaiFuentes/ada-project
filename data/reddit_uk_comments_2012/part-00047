He was hypnotizing all of Britain, pretty sure she's part of that, they were able to break the connection in the end thanks to spacemagic which caused his 'wife' to see the light and shoot him.

They don't come and you wait.

So you do the only thing you can do: you try to forget. Try to forget that you had another life, that there's so much you'll miss. You try to move on.

You spend over a generation. *Decades* fighting to survive, and each day your life slips away. Each day you come closer and closer to death, knowing that all those years you could have spend with those you love are gone *forever*.

And then, after all those years, they come back.

The Doctor's not even there. He's hiding in the TARDIS. He sent Rory to go past all the androids to fetch you because apparently he can't be bothered.

And then what happens?

They decide they don't want *you*. They don't want to see the ramifications of their mistake.

Corluka is more or less dead wood, but with the fact that we can't keep a defender healthy for 2 games it would have been nice to have him around for depth. Pavs was dangerous when he was interested, Bassong was dead wood.  Can't really argue with those moves.

Same could be said for Saha, he has looked good for us but would have been much better suited if we could have pulled a striker like Llorrente, Remy or Damiao into the fold. Krasic has already admitted that not joining Spurs in Jan was a mistake.

Harry has struggled with the rotation and they missed out on a couple moves that could have helped, though part of that seems to be because we insist on making moves late in every window and not being proactive.",0,1335217025,null,0,false,0,c4fpy4l,t3_sobgx,t1_c4fpy4l,t3_sobgx,null,1428781183,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

If life were a race, and you imagined every benefit that you got just for being a certain skin colour as a step forward from the starting line, white people would be massively further ahead than all other races here in the western world. Life is a game of playing catch-up for some races, because they're already discriminated against (both institutionally and on a social level) for the colour of their skin, something they cannot change.

Rory was armed with a laser-hand and knew that all alien life in the universe was dead, so all he had to deal with was humans. Humans from the past against him with a laser gun. And even then there was more waiting than actual fighting to survive. Mostly just standing around and following the box.

Amy on the other hand was trapped against her will on a foreign planet with no other life. Even the androids have no faces. It's stark white, you're completely alone, and there are robots that could kill you with a single touch roaming about the entire place.

Rory didn't comment on the TARDIS because, as he said he ""studied up on all the latest scientific theories"". Additionally, several companions have gone into the TARDIS with only a passing ""bigger than you'd think"" if even that. Not unusual, and even if Rory did know about TARDISes (which again, makes no sense as we watch him grow up with Amy in Let's Kill Hitler), why would he tip his hand like that, presuming that the Master is pretending to be him. (And remember, if he was using the Chameleon-Arch to become human, he would not retain the memories of TARDISes).

The hotel was not designed to show fears and show fears alone. It was designed to expose and exploit people's faiths to harness their ""emotional energy"". Rory had no faith. Rory had no room. They even explicitly explain this fact.

Rory hasn't gone mad because that timeline was erased. He only remembers the events when he thinks about it. He's mostly forgotten everything, as they explain in The Day of the Moon.

It helps if you think of it all as a straight line coming from the 1st Doctor all the way to the 11th. The clone of 10 is a branch off of this line but not a deviation of it. Regenerating in to 9 again would be a loop from the end of the line (11) leading back to 9. Which completely breaks the formula. Considering it's all been a straight, linear, line up until then.

That probably would have been easier if I'd drawn a picture but I think you get the point.

Because America started as a blank slate with no indigenous culture to assimilate to, it's culture feeds off the heritage of the inhabitants. it's like if we eventually colonize Mars, even after several generations we'll still remember we're from Earth and remember the customs we brought to Mars from it.

Education is for the good of society, we will benefit from it in the long run.

People are more than just economic devices, treating them as such is an outmoded Victorian model that doesn't work unless your end goal is to maintain a caste system.

Funding for PhD students and research in general is the real problem eating away at universities; we need more of it because its where *stuff* comes from. You want growth and ideas, this is where the money should go. Instead you have brilliant mathematicians going into financial services because it pays *so much*, lowering the quality of PhD candidates directly after undergraduate level. Next the government makes it impossible for foreign students at Russell group universities to stay past finishing their course, lowering the pool standard even further.

Once I got to the front I bought a few items for about £70, I was a little annoyed that I missed out on the good stuff I really wanted, but no big deal I thought Ill head to ebay when I got back home.

Two hours later Im at home, I turn my PC on and head to ebay, and would you believe it...  everything you want was there at a massively inflated cost (Kate bush 10inch for £40-90). I thought id do a search by distance...yep, within a 10 mile radius of my city loads of record store day records for sale...basically some of the arseholes who where in front of me where just buying them up to put them back up on ebay and make a quick buck.

Really depressing, but hay ho! should have queued up earlier and got to the front sooner.

true,ChuckSpears,null,null,"We have all heard politicians talk about diversity, tolerance, understanding, multiculturalism, immigration, integration, assimilation, the melting pot, and so on.  What do they mean by this?  And what is their long-term goal?

“*The goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists.*”

So says former Harvard Professor Noel Ignatiev, whose magazine is called **Race Traitor**.

Anti-racists will rarely admit their goal as clearly as Professor Ignatiev does.  Anti-racists generally will not call themselves “race traitors” or “anti-white,” nor will they call white genocide their goal. Instead of saying it directly, they call themselves “anti-racist” and then argue for “a melting pot” where all will be mixed and become brown.

___

This goal of abolishing the white race can be divided into four basic stages:

 1. The demonization of whites. Another term for this is what is often referred to as “white guilt”
 - Third world immigration into all white countries and only into white countries
 - Forced integration as the first step towards assimilation. Assimilation is not directly forced but everybody who opposes it is condemned for being “racist”
 - In addition, anyone who speaks out against any part of the process of white genocide will be denounced as a “racist”, or as a “white supremacist”, or as a “naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.”


___

The demonization of whites, i.e. the white guilt complex, makes white people accept non-white immigration, integration and assimilation, leading to a melting pot where all formerly white countries turn brown, thus eventually eliminating the white race.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; there is no longer any public investment in teaching for almost all subjects

What does this mean?  I'm not sure of the specifics that you are actually claiming here.  There was very little investment for teaching at the university level in the first place, as research has always been viewed as being most important.  Further, I'm unclear as to how a lack of public funding for teaching is supposed to imply that HE has been privatised.

Universities in the UK have always acted as if they are private institutions.  They set their own entrance criteria, manage their own budgets, decide what they teach, decide degree requirements (subject to vetting by professional standard's bodies, etc.).  So I'm not really clear what it is you feel has changed since the coalition came to power.

&gt; They have also given a private equity firm the power to award (sell) degrees.

As long as the degrees are vetted by independent bodies, what of it?  The value of a degree is not dependent on the public/private status of the awarding body, but of the reputation of that awarding body amongst employers and the general public.",0,1335261244,null,0,false,0,c4fxfn3,t3_solzo,t1_c4fxfn3,t1_c4fxd95,null,1428784778,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

An increase of 100% means nothing without some figures to measure it against.

You're talking about stop and searches which are a completely different issue to prosecutions.

But on the subject of stop and searches, there are many explanations for police disproportionately targeting black youths. For a start, high crime areas have more black people than the national average, black youths have a culture of looking like ""gangstas"", and most importantly black youths commit more crimes than their white counterparts.

In terms of university funding, this is a minority share of funding (perhaps describing it as ""very little"" was an exagerration, but describing research funding as the focus in this country is not).  It provides an additional 50% of that figure in terms of direct research funding, with the other research councils providing billions more in research funding.  Further still, the UK is actually the leading recipient of EU funds (by far, 4000 more projects funded than Germany, under FP7 at least) for research funding, as well as providing funding from pan-European scientific bodies like CERN and EMBL.  In other words, the focus is most definitely on research funding in this country.

&gt; First off, many universities don't do much research, that's why the Russell group claims to be so prestigious.

Like who?  I can't think of any university that I know of that doesn't do much research.  Even second rate teaching universities have extensive research budgets.

Further, the Russell Group claims to be the group of the leading research universities in the country.  They don't claim to be prestigious because the other universities don't do any research.  Further, there's a whole panoply of competing university groupings that were set up in response to the Russell Group (e.g. the 1994 Group).

&gt; HEFCE provided Universities with over 5 billion quid this year. Perhaps that's ""very little investment"" to you, but to me, that sounds like a lot.

Yes, and a good chunk (~40%) of that went to research funding, not to teaching.

I believe that marriage is an out of date institution and as such, it would be easier if it simply ceased to exist as a legally recognised arrangement.

Soldado would be an amazing signing, and with Valencia's financial problems he may be attainable, but it would mean going against other European big teams, as the man has got a reputation for getting goals for his teams.

Someone who is missing off of your list I think though, is Ricky Van Wolfswinkel, he has been on fire for SCP this season, and could be the affordable option for our drought, he does have the problem of dropping off as he was formally a attacking midfielder, but the man gets goals and thats what we need.",0,1335267555,null,0,false,0,c4fxy0e,t3_sns9o,t1_c4fxy0e,t1_c4fla53,null,1428785019,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

My argument here is that black people get prosecuted more because they are unfairly targetted as criminals when in reality on the streets it's everyone committing the crimes. You cant then counter my argument by then citing how often black people get prosecuted. Much like the US, i believe in the UK it is far easier to get out away with a crime if you're white. 


high crime areas have more black people than the national average because high crime areas are poor areas, and unfortunately, a lot of black people are poor. Thats not because we're all a bunch of criminals, as much as i'm sure you'd like to believe that. It's probably got more to do with the fact we've only had the same rights as white people for about 40 years, and only recently are we being taken seriously. This is a bit hard when we have dickwads like you implying we're responsible for the majority of the crime because we're black.

'black youths have a culture of looking like gangsters'. Actually think about this. Since when has the image of a gangster been one of a kid on a street corner in a tracksuit? Fucking hell. Never. Black youths, and  poor white and asian youths a like, often follow a certain fashion sense. *Much like everyone*.  If you want to label that fashion sense as trying to look like a gangster, feel free. but that is *Your* label you're putting on there. I'm not denying that some youths like to front like gangsters, but they arent saying thats down to what they wear, **You are.**

Note how he's not even actually angry.[ He's just making ridiculous faces to make a joke that's not even funny.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKT_sE4B7WI)

Additionally, the Joker is a completely different character than the Master with motivations that (in his mind) actually make sense.

He's an agent of chaos, so of course he's going to act like a lunatic. In fact, that's a key point of his character. He is the frayed livewire of insanity that the straight-laced Batman keeps bottled up.

It's key that the Joker is Batman's antithesis. He is the animated force of chaos while Batman is the stern and collected force of order. They are opposites tied together, two sides of the same coin.

But the Doctor is already silly and wacky and goofy. A silly and wacky and goofy villain is needless, especially since he operates on a completely different scale than the Joker.

The Master doesn't want chaos, he actively wants order under him. He *hates* humans and finds them to be inferior filth, so why would he prance about listening to their music? It just doesn't make sense, whereas the Joker decidedly does.

Additionally, the Joker never made jokes (ironically) and didn't dance to music (certainly not to Scissor Sisters) and didn't in general make himself look ""wacky"". He was just plain crazy.

It also helps that everything that the Joker did were funny asides whereas the Master had several over-the-top and unintentionally unfunny scenes where they completely revolve around how ""wacky"" he is.

I actually have mixed views on this, the suffering that men who have been falsely accused of rape have endured is unreal, all because their name is public. However it has always been the case to make the name public because then other women who have been attacked can come forward and provide evidence, as has been the case so many times before. ( I don't mean with celebs). And I don't think any woman who has been raped, no matter what the circumstances should have their anonymity lifted. 

It is a really fine line and I am not sure what the answer is.

true,infidel118i,null,null,"While i've already said a lot in this thread (and in return, received many downvotes), i really want to try and explain myself properly, hopefully I wont get downvotes as much. I'm simply trying to explain why i feel how i feel. You can disagree if you like.

Firstly, Lee Jasper is an idiot. I obviously dont need to explain how racist black people can be. Though by his (wrong) definition, it would make sense. Black people are never really in a position where they can use their 'black privilege' to get one over on the white man. Black privilege isn't a thing. White privilege is.

I'm mixed race (Though often out of habit, say black.). I'm 20 years old, and i grew up and live in newham. Over the years i've had many friends, of many races. Many of my old friends and schoolmates are now criminals. Teens involved in gun crime, drug dealing, theft and so on. I've witnessed that crime really is a multicultural thing that is not exclusive to any one race. One of my oldest white friends was caught with some firearms not so long ago. No one knows about that. He also slings coke. No one knows about that. Where i live, people get put away for crimes, people get away with crimes, and it's always just... people. But then i take a step out of it all, i look at how the place i'm from is perceived, and i have everyone telling me 'It's all the blacks. They've all got weapons and try to be gangsters'.

No, my friend. It's poor people. A lot of us have weapons and get caught up in gangs. Poor areas breed desperation and desperation breeds crime and never by any stretch have these crimes been exclusive to black people, or white people. I'm not trying to use being poor as an excuse, but it is the root of the problem. Not race.

I also understand that apparently over half the suspects of knife crime are black. To me, and those who live here, that just proves a point that it's harder to get away with a crime if you're black. Because all races are responsible for it. So many crimes go unsolved and no one can tell you what race did what, but thats because people of all races are responsible for the crimes here. It just so happens that if you're black, you're more likely to be pulled over, or stopped and searched.

If you target one demographic and continually pull them up trying to get them for crimes, *You will get a lot of convictions*. If the tables turned and they began pulling over every white boy in a tracksuit over in the bits, it would shock you to learn how many of them are toughened criminals, too.


There really is unfair targeting and that is the reason why so many black people end up getting convicted of crimes. Because they're treated as suspects from the start. 

Now if we try and ignore the horrendous wording of Lee Jaspers statement, and understand the sentiment that he *did explain*.
&gt;Racism is prejudice plus power. Black people can be prejudiced but not racist.

He's essentially saying, black people can be racist, but that isn't as dangerous because they're not the ones calling the shots. That isnt to say it's therefore okay for blacks to be racist, it's just going to have less of an effect on the country as a whole because they're often going to be quite insignificant. Black racists will never be taken seriously. Rightly so.",0,1335271228,null,0,true,0,c4fycnx,t3_spp3f,t1_c4fycnx,t3_spp3f,null,1428785211,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;My argument here is that black people get prosecuted more because they are unfairly targetted as criminals when in reality on the streets it's everyone committing the crimes.

Do you actually have any citations for this?

I never said that whites and Asians aren't committing crimes, I'm saying that blacks are committing more crime per person. It's not even by a small margin.

&gt;high crime areas have more black people than the national average because high crime areas are poor areas, and unfortunately, a lot of black people are poor.

I never said that this wasn't the case. I understand that part of the reason why black people cause so much crime is due of poverty and poor upbringings. That doesn't give them immunity to the police.

&gt;Thats not because we're all a bunch of criminals, as much as i'm sure you'd like to believe that.

Oh, of course, call me a racist. Statistical evidence contrary to your beliefs must be racist.

&gt;This is a bit hard when we have dickwads like you implying we're responsible for the majority of the crime because we're black.

I never claimed this, not even once. I am saying that blacks are responsible for the majority of crime in the areas where stop and searches are common. More specifically London, but it is the same in all major cities.

Is it sexist to say that the majority of rapists are male?

&gt;Actually think about this. Since when has the image of a gangster been one of a kid on a street corner in a tracksuit?

The actually quote was ""gangstas"", which has a particular connotation with young black culture. It was not a misspelling of ""gangster"" on my part.

Kids on a street corner in tracksuits are clearly more likely to be involved in criminal activity than the average person.

&gt;Black youths, and poor white and asian youths a like, often follow a certain fashion sense. Much like everyone.

Of course they do. That is why they are getting searched in higher numbers.

If you share a similar appearance to people committing the majority of crime, while being a minority of people, then what else do you expect to happen?

&gt;If you want to label that fashion sense as trying to look like a gangster, feel free.

It's also important to remember that this fashion goes hand in hand with idolising criminality and drugs.

&gt;I'm not denying that some youths like to front like gangsters, but they arent saying thats down to what they wear, You are.

You're doing it again. I say something and then you twist it to mean something completely different.

I never said that what you wear defines who you are. But who you are often defines what you wear. If you chose to wear clothes associated with criminality then you are asking to attract police attention.

&gt;And again, it's not race exclusive. To imply it is race exclusive is to essentially say 'i have no idea what i'm on about and only see the world the way I like to see it.'.

No one other than you has even been saying that this is about race. It's just a fact that black kids are going to attract more police attention. This does not mean that if you are born black that you are going to start committing more crimes than a white boy in the same circumstances.

I think you missed my point.  What is the likelihood of a given crime being reported as the offender being black?  How does the racial breakdown of stop-and-search compare to the racial breakdown of reported offenders?  
  
I'm not saying that I don't think there is racism in the police - I'm just saying that in order to use statistics to prove the point, you have to supply the correct statistics.  The rate of stop and search of black people *relative to other races* is meaningless without knowing the proportion of black people reported as committing crimes that they're being stopped and search for.  Are there more police in areas where there happen to be larger concentrations of people in general, and black people in particular?  Are crimes reported differently in different areas?

You really need a full set of figures to accurately map institutionalised racism.

Yes indeed.  But none of these things support the notion that the *police* are racist.  They can only investigate crimes that have been committed, and they're only going to stop people who fit the profile of those reported incidents.

&gt;You seem to miss the fact that gangs are mostly multicultural. 

I said ""high crime areas have more black people than the national average"". We can assume that more blacks are involved with gangs, as a percentage of their race, than whites nationally. So when all members of gangs are searched the statistics come off as particularly targeted towards black youths, because of their high level of participation in gangs.

They are not necessarily being searched because they are black, but they are being searched and happen to be black.

&gt;That the Met has a history of racial discrimination against ethnic and has been deemed institutionally racist. 

This is true. But maybe a lot of their racism is not really racism. I honestly do not believe that they go out to pick on people because they are black in this day and age. They may just have a prejudice against black people because of the high number of crimes they commit while being such a small minority. I know I am more cautious of poor youths who look a certain way than I am of respectable looking people of any race, it just happens to be that the poor ones are often black. I wouldn't call it racist.

Obviously there are some just plain racist coppers, but I doubt they're the majority.

&gt;That crime is mainly a product of social circumstance, poverty breeds crime, and black people in the UK still live in some of the poorest parts of the country.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;If a woman reports that a man has raped her (or indeed vice versa), why is it then necessary to plaster the accused name all over the media ? Why is it necessary to find OTHER potential victims, instead of just investigating the specific case on it's own merits ?

It is not necessary, what are you on about? You are taking the standpoint that once a man is arrested for rape, that the police actively seek out other individuals? No it is about women coming forward with information that they, for a number of reasons, did not feel able to come forward with before. This also happens in the case of serial killers, ex-partners of them have come forward to give evidence when they have seen their name in the paper, evidence that may well have helped secure a conviction of a guilty person. Your confusion lies with viewing people as always wanting to victimise men, that is not what I am saying at all and if you had read my other comments you would understand that. 

As for 'plastered all over the media' this doesn't happen with every rape case, only the ones the media deem newsworthy. It is usual to keep it to a local (ish) newspaper.

&gt;Rape is one of those crimes where innocence or guilt do not matter, the accusation is sufficient to ruin one or more lives.

Indeed, which is why I am still divided on the issue. On another note, the punishment for making a false rape accusation seems to be not much more than a slap on the wrist, perhaps if the punishment was more severe women would think twice about making such an accusation.

This reddit, is (thankfully) mostly free of feminism crap and MRA BS and that is the way it should be kept. You mistake hostility for being direct and blunt. 

&gt;The comment you replied to has done nothing to deserve your ire - there are schools of feminist thought that hold to the sociological definition of sexism, that of 'prejudice + power'. This is a fact, no matter how much you dislike it. 

There are some, which is why myself and other women have disengaged themselves from the feminist military, however, some feminists, is not the same as ' a lot' and it still does not negate the fact that some MRAs use it as an excuse to spread sexist comments through the reddits wherever they get chance.

I like the way you oh-so-cleverly put me down by calling me 'mindless', that gave me a genuine chuckle :-) A different irrelevant topic that was introduced by another posts you mean? Yeah that will be the one.

&gt;It goes on because the politically correct brigade says that you have to have so many employees from certain ethnic backgrounds so that your work force represents the multi-culture society that is the UK.

The two don't go hand in hand...namely because the quote from you is nonsense. Who is in the PC brigade and where did they say this? Is there a newsletter or press release we can all peruse?

The police were given a report, a report that was dire reading for them. They were told that they had fostered a system that made their everyday activities lean towards racial bias. They were deemed institutionally racist. 

They're *own* solution? Try and have the police force reflect the population that's being policed. If an area is 70% white, 20% Asian and 10% black why would the police force in that area be 95% white and 5% other? The only reason is to say there's some inherent difference between the races that made the white population more suited to the job. Lets assume you're not absurd enough to be thinking this, then there has to be a reason. One reason that was found was recruitment.

Remember the good old days when you were recommended a job by a family friend or went to work for your uncle? Remember the days when father and son would work together in the same factory, just the end of a long line of generations of tradesmen that did the same thing?

Now imagine an immigrant population coming into that world and trying to compete for jobs in places where, maybe not through racism, but plain old nepotism they're seemingly locked out. Imagine those people set up news papers and magazines that reflect their interests...papers like The Voice or The Asian Express. Now imagine that the police decide to have a job drive in the community to break the hold of the old boys club...what would they do?

Put an ad in the paper. But they didn't think it through and only put it in the regular local paper. Minority readers were reading their own papers and didn't see the advert. The cycle continues.

The thing you're complaining about and erroneously labelling positive discrimination is called [""Positive action""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action). At no point is the recruitment of white officers diminished, but instead a *further* effort is made to make sure those who would ordinarily be left out, through no fault of anyone, get the message.

Obviously BNP spin doctors jump in and twist it to seem that white recruits are being turned away to accommodate ill equipped ethnic minorities when in fact none of that is happening at all.

Serial killers (the operative word being SERIAL) means they have already claimed multiple victims and the police are trying to identify other possible victims of attacks.

I mean honestly, did anyone expect the producer of Queer as Folk and Second Coming to do *Doctor Who?*

But he did, and he made an impression. This new vision of Doctor Who was something that was pretty unprecedented.

Also keep in mind that the time is 2005. Star Trek had just died with Enterprise and the classic space adventure with optimism was being eschewed in favor of the dark and gritty.

Doctor Who was unique. In a time where so many protagonists were pessimistic and oftentimes prone to violence and action, the Doctor was an abberation. A pacifist who accepted all forms of life from tree-people to giant heads in jars. They really played this aspect of the character up, because that's what made him unique.

In short, I think Doctor Who resurged because it was giving them something that other science fiction at the time wasn't giving them. It gave them a real person with a real life they could relate to and showed a colorful and resplendent view of the future and space with a powerful theme of grabbing life while you can.

*However*, looking at a few of the facts, I don't think that I was too far off (Ginnj, feel free to correct me - I'm really only getting into this because a pedantic line has been drawn). First off, Ginnj didn't feel any need to correct me at all, so I'm pretty sure that means that Ginnj is, in fact, a male (or at least male-identifying) Redditor (as opposed to a Redditress, which I think is what female Redditors should be called, since it sounds awesome).

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Those two sentences contradict each other. In the case of rape, presumably a woman has gone to the police and made an accusation. Why would OTHER women come forward with information that they, for a number of reasons, did not feel able to come forward with before ?

Because they feel enabled to do so, sexual assault it complex, it is not just a this happens and therefore women will report it. Plenty of women don't either because of intimidation by the rapist, embarrassment from their family because they let themselves be put in that position, fear they wont be believed by police or family/friends, or for other reasons. Google it, have a look for the studies, there are a whole number of reasons. When a perpetrator is arrested, women are more likely to come forward and testify, often the feeling that they are not a lone is key.

&gt;Serial killers (the operative word being SERIAL) means they have already claimed multiple victims and the police are trying to identify other possible victims of attacks.

Just because someone is arrested on suspicion of being a serial killer, doesn't mean they have done it. You are contradicting yourself there.  

&gt;The man in this case was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room. Apart from interviewing the hotel staff and possibly other guests, there is NO need to look for other potential victims.

This. This is the sense that I get - that they're simply unwilling (or genuinely unable, but I have a hard time buying that when so much of the writing is quite good) to figure out a way to make the character make any internal sense.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;What do the law abiding kids of inner city London wear? Guess what...it's the same stuff the criminal kids are wearing.

The inner city kids cause more crime than other kids, hence why inner city kids get searched more often. And as a high proportion of inner city kids are black it happens to look like black kids are searched disproportionately.

&gt;It's lazy, and in a police force leads to lazy policing.

It may be lazy, but I would rather them unfairly target groups that look like they are criminal rather than have them commit crimes. Getting knifes off the streets does save lives. So if you search every ""gangsta"" looking male and find a few knifes, that can't be a bad thing for society. I don't like the idea of such policing being deployed onto me, but in places with such high levels of violent crime it seems sensible.

&gt;You reveal yourself when you start talking about gold chains and tracksuits. It's almost as if you're stuck in the 90s with Ali G stereotypes. Again, lazy. Look back on the summer riots of last year. you won't see a gold chain in a single shot. Now Google Image search for the word Chav. what do you see? mostly white, largely Northern youths wearing baseball caps, tracksuits and gold chains. It's not a black thing, it's a poor and young people all over the World thing.

When I see the London riots I see loads of poor youths in tracksuits, lots of them black. From a policing standpoint it seems fair to search everyone in tracksuits, after all most of the suspects fit that description.

I'm sure stop and searches are just as common in areas where crime is high and the people exclusively white. I'm just not convinced there are many such areas, at least not in the south.

&gt;Where do you live where the kids rock around in pressed trousers and dress shirts?

No I didn't.  I made a choice to move or be unemployed, unable to pay my rent and then evicted.  Zero difference.

As for the job situation, if any of these people were employed they would not be moved (as others have commented).  So these people don't have jobs in London.  If they are not working in London then they likely can't work so it does not matter if they are unemployed in Stoke, London or Timbuktu really does it?

As for passing the problem, welfare should be nationally not locally funded and while I accept it isn't, we already ""pass the problem"" in 100 other places like this so until we reform the whole system I don't think these 76 people/families qualify for special treatment.

Finally, no, they don't pay tax because they don't earn.  The taxpayer pays their VAT like the taxpayer pays all their other costs because they live on benefits.  Also going from 17.5 to 20% on non essential items is not huge, at least not compared to the increases in tax I have to pay...

The simple case is this:  Right now we store economically inactive people in areas of high economic activity.  That makes no sense, especially when there is such high demand for that space among the economically active.  This is like keeping your plants in the bath and then whenever you need to bathe walking to the garden shed, carry the bath back to the bathroom, bathing and then carrying it all back in.  And all because of some weird idea that there should be an equal share of plants in the house and garden and an equal share of bathroom fixtures in both as well.

The Doctor is an honest character.  He has ""issues"", is not perfect, gets emotional, makes bad decisions, but ultimately cares for the people closest to him.  I think this is something people are able to relate to.  Everyone makes mistakes, everyone gets emotional etc and having a world saving alien with only mild super powers (two hearts, regeneration, ability to absorb radiation etc) who uses a screwdriver as his main 'weapon' appeals to many in our current era.  Also what jimmysilverrims said.  

Sci-fi is a sad place atm with very little real sci-fi being made.  What does get made is either a reboot (which leaves my childhood memories in tatters) or a rip-off in some way or another.  I hope that one day, we will have more sci-fi being made, but I also hope the good Doctor never runs out of generations.  I was sceptical of the New Who, but through Eccles and Tennant, I learnt it was ok and relished it being made for new generations.  For my sprogs*, they were pleased to see DW made in a way they could relate to...I can't tear them away from Classic if it's on, but they relate more to New than they do Classic.  

I also think part of it comes down to a need for many people to feel acceptance, both when it comes to feeling accepted and when it comes to society accepting outliers. Which, let's face it, it's past time for.

true,Tactful,uk,Bristol,"There are certain ""hot button"" issues that make certain people go off into a blind rage where they can't see logic or reason.

Child Porn is one those. It's probably one of the worst things, along with Rape and Massive Terrorist Attacks, to the extent that anyone seen ""not hating"" it, or ""empathising"" with it, or not doing everything they can to supposedly ""stop it"" is seen as some sort of child porn facilitating monster.

In its treatment, Drugs and Piracy are similar. There are expected losses; the problem lies within the individuals not the substances and vices. People will always pirate; making things more difficult to pirate is a waste of time, money and effort. People will always take drugs; there will always be a surplus of people in societal situations where they feel they need or want to experiment with mind-altering substances. You can't eliminate this need any more than you can eliminate the rise of paedophilia in a person's mind.

Now, two points arise from this that are often ignored by the opposition:

Firstly, the terminology of child porn is all-inclusive. A child in terms of pornography is anyone under the age of eighteen, I believe. Maybe sixteen. I've seen a fair amount of pornography, and I can't guarantee you right now that I've never seen an underage person in a pornographic situation. However, I'm physically disgusted by the idea of child exploitation (obviously, goes without saying) and if there's a girl who looks, say, sixteen or younger in a sexual situation it's not going to arouse me. My point is that the way the Daily Mail treats child porn, you think it would always be very young pre-pubescent children locked in basements and shit. It isn't; there's a dichotomy.

Secondly, and this is really important; there's a myth that, in the UK at least, is gladly dying out that these negative things, these vices, are pushed down your throat. In my noughties schooling career I heard the phrase ""peer pressure"" a lot. ""Peer pressure"", ""just say no"", ""don't do what you aren't comfortable with doing"". These are all fair points, but they don't address the core problem: Your kids want to do these supposedly negative things. Your strong, glorious son actually wants to smoke weed; his friends aren't forcing him to directly or otherwise, he actually wants that feeling, he wants to have fun. Your beautiful darling little daughter actually wants to experiment sexually; she's not being forced into anything, she's enjoying it. She wants those experiences, or at least she thinks she does enough to consent. 

The problem here, as addressed in the post, is that people seem to things are being pushed down your children's throat. No drug dealer is forcing your kid to buy drugs, no boyfriend is forcing your daughter to have sex at fifteen (well, I mean, potentially they are, but that's a different discussion) and in order to view pornography, your child has to want to see it.

You don't want your child viewing porn? Put a parental blocker on the internet. Or even better; don't let them have a computer till they're at an age where them viewing porn is seen as an inevitability rather than an accidental circumstance. I started viewing porn online at around age 9 I think, and I'm a well-rounded person able to form mature and pleasurable sexual relationships. 

Bottom line: Teach your kids right, and they wont do these things, or at the very least if they do these things they'll do them in a safe and educated way. If my kid is going to do MDMA regardless of what I say or do, I'd rather talk to him about the effects and dosages beforehand to give him the safest possible ground for usage.",0,1335279138,null,0,false,0,c4fzpos,t3_spviv,t1_c4fzpos,t1_c4fyvnd,null,1428785852,77,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,77
true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The inner city kids cause more crime than other kids

Are you using inner city as code for black?

&gt;hence why inner city kids get searched more often

No, they're searched more often due to the lazy conclusions you're drawing.

&gt;And as a high proportion of inner city kids are black it happens to look like black kids are searched disproportionately

No, it *looks* that way because it *is* that way.

&gt;It may be lazy, but I would rather them unfairly target groups that look like they are criminal rather than have them commit crimes.

The disproportional targeting of specific groups has not been seen to reduce the sort of crime it's intending to stop. in fact the only people that suffer are weed smokers...a group Reddit seem in favour of. Funny that.

&gt;So if you search every ""gangsta"" looking male and find a few knifes, that can't be a bad thing for society.

It is when a generation of black males once again feel disenfranchised and not ""belonging"" as the cycle of non inclusion continues. You're promoting a system that in itself creates the toxic environments it's designed to police.

&gt;When I see the London riots I see loads of poor youths in tracksuits, lots of them black. From a policing standpoint it seems fair to search everyone in tracksuits

And then thus wasting police time, money and being a less effective police force, leading to...riots.

Calling you a ""he"" does not, to the best of my knowledge, actually make you male, so dragging the notion of ""biologically female by default"" is just silly.

And since when? Since the language developed. Loads of languages have them, particularly those that still use gender-based nouns (French, for instance). English used to be one of those languages, and that's where the use of the masculin by default comes from.

That's why it always used to be that sentences like ""everyone pick up his jacket"" was perfectly acceptable.

These days, as opposed to your assertion that ""most folks use 'they/them', that's not what happens. Either people just pick a pronoun, because either way they've got a roughly 50% chance of being wrong, or they alternate, and each successive pronoun used to refer to a gender-unknown person alternates between male and female.

""They/them"" is still plural in English, so using it to refer to a specific (and definitely singular) person is weirder than just making do with the fact that English lacks a gender-neutral personal pronoun (""it"" is right out) and pick one.

&gt; If my kid is going to do MDMA regardless of what I say or do, I'd rather talk to him about the effects and dosages beforehand to give him the safest possible ground for usage.

My parents were of the same mind, if I wanted to smoke I could do so, but I had to sit outside on the porch ... at -5oC in the middle of winter, even 15yo soon realize how to prioritize what is more important i.e. having a smoke or freezing your butt off. Likewise with drinking ... if you're going to drink, at least do it here in the back garden so you don't walk under a damn bus or anything. And now those lessons are being put into good practice with my own kids.

These parents who just give the kid a computer so they can get on with their own thing piss me off immensely, especially when they start demanding the Internet censors itself because they are too lazy to monitor what their own kids are doing.

And the thing is, it doesn't need to be something cynical or privacy invading, like installing NetNanny or other blocking software, because kids are smart and will be around that in 2 seconds anyway.

My 14yo daughters computer is in the same room as mine, so in the evenings we spend our time playing MMOs together, exchanging funny cartoons we've seen on Cyanide or Reddit, and generally bonding while still doing our own things. She knows there is bad stuff on the internet, and will even warn me not to go to X or Y website anymore, because they have too many ""dirty popups"".

Everything else, yeah 100% agreed. You cannot forbid kids to do anything, they'll just want to do it more. So at least talk to them and point out the dangers, even supervise them while they experiment so you're on hand to deal with the first puke or the first hangover.

I was using it in the same context as you, pretty much the literal meaning.

&gt;No, they're searched more often due to the lazy conclusions you're drawing.

It's not wrong to say that crime is higher in inner cities, and it's not unfair to point out that lots more blacks live in inner cites.

&gt;No, it looks that way because it is that way.

&gt;The disproportional targeting of specific groups has not been seen to reduce the sort of crime it's intending to stop. in fact the only people that suffer are weed smokers...a group Reddit seem in favour of. Funny that.

Statistically young blacks are being put away for more crimes than young whites. Even if all of the unsolved crimes turned out to be committed by whites, blacks would still have committed more per capita. Black youths have a higher rate of criminality, it's statistically fact. So targeting blacks seems fair to me.

&gt;It is when a generation of black males once again feel disenfranchised and not ""belonging"" as the cycle of non inclusion continues. You're promoting a system that in itself creates the toxic environments it's designed to police.

It was opportunistic violence and looting. Robbing a shop owned by an Asian, white or black man because you felt oppressed by the white police is stupid. I'm not even convinced they had any connection.

&gt;And then thus wasting police time, money and being a less effective police force, leading to...riots.

If you get someone who matches your description it's best to search them. 

&gt;Excuse me if I can't take your musings on the ""inner city"" seriously from miles away. It's usually rude to say this, but with all due respect, in this regard, you're actually clueless.

The market at work would be independent of external pressures of government or unions, it would base its prices depending on how necessary the job was, the training involved and the amount of people available to do the job (ie the amount of qualified applicants). Now if the employer didn't pay as well as his competitors or enough to attract people then it is safe to say that the employees would be tempted either to change company or career, potentially if the salary was too low then people would be less willing to enter the field altogether (causing a shortage), so employers have to set wages according to the demand and supply. 

It might seem unfair but a premier league football player (eg Rooney) can command a ridiculously high salary as there are 1. very few people who are talented as he is in football 2. There is a huge demand for people of his talent level. 

Whereas a nurse for example, who of course is very important to society, is paid significantly less as 1. Although qualified, he/she isn't as qualified as  a doctor for example. 2.

That's when I would have been wrong. Only under that circumstance would I have referred to someone by the wrong gender. If you happen to know for a stone-cold fact that Ginnj is a she, then I'll go back and even edit that original ""offensive"" post to represent reality. Which is why my very first reaction was to ask you if I was, in fact, wrong.

However, you're not going to get anywhere by just blindly asserting that the rules of language and linguistics have developed in any way other than the way they have. My point stands, that traditionally the way to ascribe a pronoun to a gender-unknown individual is to use the masculin, and nothing you can say will change that.

In any academic or professional writing circles, using ""they"" or ""them"" to refer to a single person is just wrong - end of story. Whether you're writing a book, for a newspaper, a magazine, or a school, ""they"" refers to more than one of something, and that's that, whether you like it or not.

I happen to think that it could and should develop into a gender-neutral pronoun, but the fact is that it hasn't yet. Rail all you want, but you're still wrong about that.

&gt;It's generally not acceptable to call someone by the wrong gender. 

Right. See my first point here. As it stands now, neither of us can actually say that I did what you're accusing me of, and I can only assume that you have no more idea whether I was wrong than I do.

I'm not ""insisting"" on calling anyone by their wrong gender. That would be a dick move.

Decriminalisation is a good step towards improving the treatment of abusers, shifting it away from incarceration and towards healthcare. IMO decriminalisation is a necessary step to take before legalisation.

There is far to much stereotyping and negative rettrick about benefit claimants at the moment, its like you should be ashamed for not having a job, which in the current economical circumstance, no one but the financial sector is to blame for this. If you do claim, then the powerful attempt to treat you like shit. Do benefit claimants have less rights? No. So don't treat them like shit.

But when I pick up on it, it is a 'mindless rant and irrelevant'? Hmm ok then. 

&gt;I'm sure some MRAs do use all kinds of things to create all sorts of arguments, but the only person looking for argument here is you: observing that some feminists, even a lot of feminists, ascribe to a particular paradigm is not the same as manufacturing

Yes they do indeed, as to feminists. However it was not relevant to the topic at all, I could say "" A lot of MRAs consider women in rape cases to have too much power and therefore the system is prejudiced against men "", but it is not relevant to the topic whatsoever. 

&gt;This subreddit is generally blessedly free of such froth, and yet you, while declaring your wish to avoid it, are the one who brings it here, baiting the 'MRAs' who downvoted you, insisting that every mention of feminism is a coded sexist remark. 

You think that is a bait??? It was more of a piss-taking reflection of the upvote/downvote on here, and on reddiquette itself, it is far too easy for someone to downvote because they disagree rather than actually respond to my post, as you have done. My post would not have even appeared had the poster, not claimed 'a lot' of feminists think x y z. Comment history always provides some insight too. 

&gt;t was a relevant comparison, nothing more, and should not be taken as a battlecry

The relevance of it is where we disagree.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The difference is that the government doesn't set the price of drugs and there exists a market for them outside of the NHS, what they the government does is it uses its bargaining position to achieve economies of scale to reduce the cost of the drugs and then subsidises it for the consumer (NHS patient). The drug prices are still dictated by the market its just that the government is able to bargain the price down a little due to economies of scale and then subsidises it. 

I'm not anti government and I think it can play a positive role. I think the idea of subsidised medication for the NHS is a fantastic one. The reason I didn't address the NHS is because it isn't a very good example for describing the markets role in dictating the price of goods. 

I also had an appointment to make so I couldn't exactly spend a lot of time addressing the issue.

true,widgetas,null,null,"That's the only stumbling block I have: if the CoE wishes to remain state sanctioned then it really should abide by equality laws. An analogy I like to make is with mixed race marriage. Unlike the US, I don't think the UK had laws regarding interracial marriage, however it should go without saying that there were strong social pressures against such things.

Now, there would be uproar and outrage if a church in the UK refused to wed an interracial couple (with it being on the record that that's why it was). Yet the arguments that could be presented for this opposition, being those given in the US decades ago, are similar or the same to those given now in opposition to gay marriage: Redefining traditional marriage, state changing the meaning, 'against our god's will' etc. These were all said about blacks marrying whites.

So why is gay marriage so different?

Personally I think there is a solution to the gay marriage issue: Grant marriage licences for any group or venue that wishes to carry out marriage ceremonies for everyone. If a group doesn't want to marry some people (no gays for example) then that's fine: we simply don't grant them a licence. At all. I really don't think it can be argued that a church - *any* church - cannot function, or is being denied certain basic rights, by not being able to marry people. I'm not aware of there being a law somewhere that says a religious group has the right to perform ceremonies - I could be wrong.

&gt;In a time where so many protagonists were pessimistic and oftentimes prone to violence and action, the Doctor was an aberration. A pacifist who accepted all forms of life from tree-people to giant heads in jars. They reallyl played this aspect of the character up, because that's what made him unique.

I would contend that it wasn't just having a character who wasn't pessimistic or prone to violence, it was a character who had good reason to be pessimistic and had committed great acts of violence, who was now living with the consequences of his actions. The Time War was a brilliant bit of plot device for reintroducing some mystery into the story, but also gave the Doctor something to be reacting against. The first series saw the Ninth Doctor in a very dark place and we got to see him come back from that over the course of the season, and even on into the Tenth Doctor's era.

So in other words, I think that the show very actively created a protagonist who was attempting to break the mold of his own past and the trend in sci-fi generally.

true,Tactful,uk,Bristol,"&gt;Many TV programmes and magazines

Ah yes, TV programmes and magazines, perfect representations of what the general teenage public are thinking.

Let's think back to your youth. Remember when all those kids were like ""take drugs"", and you were like ""no"" and they were all like ""but dude if you dont take drugs you arent cool"". Remember that? Nope, me neither, because it didn't happen. Similarly, plenty of teens have sex for the same reason adults have sex; it's pleasurable. When I was fifteen, I made the choice to smoke weed, an illegal drug, for the first time. This was a decision made after research, and based on my own wants and personal experience. 

I'm obviously not saying this is true of all cases.

The Daily Mail dichotomy comment is basically this: If you masturbate to amateur pornography, there's a chance you've masturbated to something that could technically be considered child porn, if any of the people involved are under the age of consent in their country. However,  in this hypothetical situation, I as a viewer thought she was eighteen or older. I thought I was watching two adults having sex, however I'm still a criminal for having viewed that content.

All I was saying is there are considerations to be made when it comes to the issue of child pornography; Not all child pornography is very young children being abused, there are levels. It's not just GOOD PORN and BAD PORN, it's not black and white. Maybe dichotomy was a bad word. I wouldn't want to be lumped in with the actual paedophiles because I downloaded a video involving a fifteen year old who looked 22. 

Anyway, that wasn't even my driving point. If your child is giving into peer pressure, then you've already failed as a parent. You didn't give them the social skills necessary to resist pressure from friends and society. That's still your fault, as a parent. If your kid does drugs because his friends do drugs and he wants to fit in, even though he doesn't personally enjoy the drugs, your child is a fucking moron.

If you're looking to get into Oxford this won't change your chances of getting in. If you want to get a taste of the real thing: go to an open day.

**Edit:** giving it a bit more thought, it says these are involved in the price:

* Accommodation

* Meals

* Refreshments at lectures

* Excursions

Those are all normal things you'd expect to have when you visit somewhere, yet take up 5/7 of the points they list with fees.

* University application support

That is misleading. That would be *their own* support material, not official OU material (I say this because the university would not want to charge you for better chances to get in).

* Lectures and seminars

Pretty meaningless on the long run. If you go into Oxford there are plenty of talks by various university societies/bodies that are open to all members of the public, either for free or by a small, understandable charge.

My impressions of this are that it's a money maker and will be of little-to-no help. There are unarguably far better ways to spend £1,500.

**Edit 2:**  I just saw the pictures underneath.

* You get free accommodation at an open day if you apply for it.

* You will get lectures, library tours, and discussion groups at an open day, which are also subject specific.

* They have included breakfast, lunch, and dinner as separate pictures.

* You can go punting yourself, see Oxford yourself (and at your own pace), and visit the museum *yourself*.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; If you're under the age of consent, you can't consent.

Indeed, and if the age of consent were the same everywhere, it would probably make more sense. But when you have the crazy situation with say, U.S. States ...

*age of consent 16 (31 states): Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia*

*age of consent 17 (9 states): Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Wyoming*

*age of consent 18 (11 states): Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin*

So you get teens taking a joyride across a state border so they can ""legally"" have sex where it wouldn't be allowed in their own state (because that makes so much fucking sense for worried parents wondering where their ""little"" girl or boy is).

Note, it's the SAME PERSON doing the consenting, so the whole ""age of consent"" thing is a purely legal term and says nothing about the relative maturity of the people involved and their capability to make informed decisions. I've known some very mature 16 year olds, and some very dumb 35 year olds. Being able to consent has NOTHING to do with age, and certainly nothing to do with geographical location.

True, kids don't make ALL their decisions in a vacuum, but neither can you pin the blame 100% on peer pressure and the media. Kids are a bunch of raging hormones from the age of 14 onwards, and if memory serves me, we spent all our schoolyard breaks looking at girlie magazines ... no one forced us, we wanted to know what it was all about.

&gt; no boyfriend is forcing your daughter to have sex at fifteen (well, I mean, potentially they are, but that's a different discussion)

&gt; Yeah, this really doesn't work as a point.

Two very good friends of mine were having sex at 15 and unfortunately she fell pregnant - thank FSM this was in UK in the 80s, an age where common sense still existed and paranoia was still a mental condition and not a national pastime - but even there, had the boy been 16, he'd have been in a shitload of legal trouble. Which is nonsense - no one was forced, both parties consented and WANTED it to happen.

&gt; I agree that kids should be educated, but your stances on child porn and peer pressure are vague and a little weird.

Well if you want to equate a 17 years 364 days old girl posting bikini shots on facebook as ""Child Porn"" then nothing anyone says is going to sway you otherwise.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; Evidently, everyone is not capable of doing that, but the fact that the law says a 16 year old can fuck in one place doesn't mean that it's automatically morally OK, it just means you're less likely to go to prison for doing it. 

Ah, so it's morally wrong to sleep with a 16 year old then ? I think the whole of Western Europe and 31 US States might want to have a word with you about your ""morals"".

&gt; The person sleeping with the 16 year old is still responsible for ensuring that the consent is valid and not coercive because, if it is not, whilst it is not child rape it is still rape.

Absolutely agreed ... but rape is a different topic from CP, which is what the parent raised and you attacked him for.

&gt; And I wasn't. For that matter, where did I mention the media?

""Many TV programmes and teen magazines"" ... EDIT : sorry, I may have taken you out of context there.

&gt; This hypothetical almost-18 girl always comes up. I don't see how she's relevant here, not that she's ever relevant.

Possibly because of idiots who equate an almost 18 year old girl posting bikini shots on Facebook as Child Porn. You haven't even accepted the legally definition of ""Child Pornography"", you've just made up your own.

*18 USC § 2256*

*For the purposes of this chapter, the term -*

*(1) “minor” means any person under the age of eighteen years;*

*(2)*

*(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), “sexually explicit conduct” means actual or simulated-*

*(i) sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex;*

*(ii) bestiality;*

*(iii) masturbation;*

*(iv) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or*

*(v) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person;*

*(B) For purposes of subsection 8(B)  [1] of this section, “sexually explicit conduct” means—*

*(i) graphic sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex, or lascivious simulated sexual intercourse where the genitals, breast, or pubic area of any person is exhibited;*

*(ii) graphic or lascivious simulated;*

*(I) bestiality;*

*(II) masturbation; or*

*(III) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or*

*(iii) graphic or simulated lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person;*

*(8) “child pornography” means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where—*

*(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;*

*(B) such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or*

*(C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.*

That hypothetical girl posting bikini shots on Facebook, never has been, nor never will be, Child Pornography - no matter how engrained it is in your mind.

Raise the cap to £346/week, ~£1500/month, and you get an additional 237 properties.

Raise the cap to £400/week ~£1750/month, and you get an additional 154 properties.

For 3-bedroom properties the cap goes up to £340/week ~£1500/month, which gives 226 properties.

Also, on the flip-side, peer pressure can be a force for good. If wasn't for my peers lightly pressuring me, I would have never spoken to my first girlfriend. It's light peer pressure that gets me to come out on the weekend when I'm not feeling up for, but then it turns into a great and really enjoyable night anyway.

To summarize; I've encountered peer pressure, we've all encountered peer pressure, but I've never encountered peer pressure that I couldn't resist, because I consider myself emotionally stable.

So they are granted a license to distribute your content (subject to the privacy settings that you select), and that license ends when you delete the content from Facebook, unless you have posted it to another user: when they delete it the license ends.

If you declare it public to the world, they can serve it to anyone, anywhere.  If it's to your friends only, they can only serve it to your friends.

Yes it is unfair. You'll also note that large parts of Liverpool and Newcastle fall into the highest crime areas in England and Glasgow is a very high crime area when including the whole UK...yet these places have very small numbers of black or any ethnic minorities for that matter.

&gt;Statistically young blacks are being put away for more crimes than young whites.

If 10 people commit a crime and have the proceeds in their pockets...5 white, 5 black, and they stand next to 10 law abiding people, again 5 white and 5 black. I decide, using stats, that I'd better take 8 black guys and 2 white guys. No matter what, I end up with more guilty black guys. The kicker is I use the results from my initial skewered investigation to justify further disproportional behaviour.

The Doctor is the modern Perseus or Achilles. He's a figure of mythos and legend and tale.

Our time has it's noble figures of lore as well, and their impact on stories around them is just as pertinent as legends of old.

They're tales, like any other. Tales that make one think, that make one hope, that make one believe in fantastical things, if only for a moment. 

It's the imagined that makes humanity great, the ability to see beyond the weight of the present and envision the impossible tomorrow. That's what pushes us, this world of dreams we create.

I would argue that the imagined often has more impact than most of what's real because the imagined offers us hope and inspiration.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Firstly - you don't need a TV licence to listen to radio. Be it  AM/FM, DAB - you don't need one. Nor do you need a licence to stream BBC / other commercial radio stations online. I reguarly listen to Radio 2 during the weekend, and haven't had a TV licence for over three year.

Secondly borbus is right - if your room isn't classed as a separate dwelling - i.e. there isn't a lock on the door, and it's not got a separate address [like houses that are converted into two flats - upstairs / downstairs, for example] then you also don't need a licence.

If it *does* have a lockable door, then you'd need one. But only for watching live TV - the situation you described doesn't necessitate one.

As for TVL - You can get them off your back. It just takes a bit of hassle. I sent an email to the head of the company outlining all the equipment capable of receiving live broadcasts I owned at the time, stating that I wasn't using said equipment in such a way that required me to have a licence, and requesting a refund on the unused quarters of my existing licence. They sent me a letter acknowledging this, a refund, and I haven't had any contact with them for over three years now.

When they **do** start sending letters again, I'll simply type up a quick affidavit, get it witnessed, and sent it to 'em via recorded delivery.",0,1335299845,null,0,false,0,c4g4kx4,t3_sqfti,t1_c4g4kx4,t3_sqfti,null,1428788219,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,OJSlaughter,eng-buckinhamshire,Aylesbury Vale,"&gt;Also if I buy games/blu rays over there will they work on my North American PS3?

Some Blu-Rays are region encoded, some are not. Look at the back of the box, the EU is region B while America is region A.

PS3 Games have no region encoding.


&gt;When I was there I noticed people were dead silent on the subway, and whenever the group of us from Canada talked people would be staring at us. Is this because people just don't talk on the subway, or because of our accents? Should I be wearing a small Canadian flag at all times to avoid being mistaken for an American?


Silence on the Underground is key. No one speak, even if you know each other.

Actually it doesn't matter that much. 


&gt;Should I be wearing a small Canadian flag at all times to avoid being mistaken for an American?


No, I honestly doubt British people care if you are American or Canadian. You will be mocked regardless.


&gt;I have a power converter from my brief trip there


Do you mean a plug adapter or a step down converter, they are very different things. I am not too sure. The Wii should be fine, to be safe you just buy a new power lead (you know the box) in the UK. The PS3 has an internal power supply, so it may be fine but may not be. Look online about that.


&gt;What are some cheap stores to buy food/beer/anything else?


Aldi, Lidl are two budget supermarkets. London is expensive, so prepare for that.


&gt;I know that fanny means something completely different there, and I've already been exposed to people saying ""are you alright?"" to me, which seems weird, kind of like something is wrong. Any other lingo I should avoid/get used to?


Don't bother trying too hard, people will pick up on it. Just don't be too loud and be polite (I hear Canadians are quite polite, so no issue)

At the University Guild of Students there are little shops inside, and the Saro Wiwa bar at the back does reasonable food, and cheap drink (apart from going to gigs; they seriously ramp up their prices).

The Oven Door cafe outside of the Guild does really cheap food. If I remember correctly all the basic burgers, batches etc were £1. Breakfast balms and double burgers were £1.50. Although it's been a couple of years since I was at uni there.

Like others have said there's a big ASDA on Smithdown Road (Just a 699 bus journey away). That 699 bus is your best friend, it goes directly from the campus to the major halls and down Smithdown, which is where the majority of students not in halls live. You may consider getting an Ariva travel pass. Usually they sell then early on in the term in the Guild shop. A bit steep, probably around £150 for the year ish, but if you use the bus often it'll save you in the long run and is convenient as you're nit rooting around for spare change all the time.

Plenty of cheapish pubs around the city if thats your thing. The Flute on Hardman Street was a personal favorite of mine. Beer and a burger for £6! The Font further up is another student pub and the Augustus John (behind the Guild). 

I'd definitely recommend the Yellow Duck Marine tour of the city to get to know some interesting facts about the place. It's basically a reclaimed amphibious vehicle from the D-Day raids of WW2 that does a tour of the city by road and then dips into the docks, so you get another view of the city. Thinks it's about £9 for an hour tour.

Do a tour of St Georges Hall and the museum and art gallery on St George's plateau. 

Even if you're not religious go to the Anglican Cathedral. It's such a beautiful building, and if you get the chance go up it's tower. I think they suggest a donation of £3.50 but it's well worth it. On a clear day you can see as far as the Lake District to the North and Wales to the South. Gives a great aerial perspective of the city. That said you may want to try the wheel of Liverpool down at Kings Dock at the front of the Echo Arena.

With regards to textbooks, I'll level with you, I bought 3 in my entire Masters course at the University. The libraries are well stocked with the courses recommended / essential texts. As long as you read the course documentation before you can usually book out the books for a semester and make sure you get the text. Alternatively in the Engineering department we had a notice board and older students would put their old books for sale on their. Often they're good as they might have annotations in them.

Hope that helps you. If you want any more information don't hesitate to either reply here or pm me on here.

RTD was about creating believable character in the beginning. Rose felt like a real person with a complicated relationship with her boyfriend and a job and a mother and fish and chips and all that stuff.

The Doctor made jokes. He had a sense of humor. He would be someone to laugh with, not an odd man to laugh at. He saw Back to the Future and The Muppet Movie and would just chat with people. He'd give hugs and just make friends. He would talk *with* people, not just to them.

Rose, Martha, Donna. You felt that they all had lives, had emotions, had  actual reasons and motivation behind every action. They felt like actual people and acted like actual people in bizarre situations.

In Time of Angels Amy says lines that make no sense for her. She says things like the Doctor ""would never talk like that"" while she's only had two adventures with him (and no inference of adventures in-between, this is her first planet, after all).

In Cold Blood Amy shrieks ""Do you know who I am? I'm *Amy Pond!*"" To a Silurian who *clearly* doesn't give a shit about what her name is. This makes no sense for her to say, it doesn't feel real. It feels like a ""funny"" (and I use that term *very* loosely) line in a script.


In RTD's run Rose and Mickey had a complicated relationship that was addressed and explored and the characters matured and changed as the show went on.

On the other hand Rory finds out that Amy snogged the Doctor and we don't see *any* of the ramifications of this. We don't see him discuss this with Amy. We don't see Amy apologize, we don't see the dynamic between them change from the cliched ""bossy, sexy wife"" and ""doormat husband"".

Perfect example: River Song.

A character who was so interesting, so mysterious, so wise. Alex Kingston had her portray this pained mix of having so much to say and knowing she can never say it. 

That was a great character. She felt pain, she felt real.

And then the next time we see her Moffat's made her into this flirty, sexy, high-heel wearing, poison kiss-giving, slinky dressed image of sex. It's such a major step backwards and a huge simplification of a brilliant character. But she's sadly forced into the ""sexy gun-toter"" that Moffat applies to all of his recent female characters. He even made *the TARDIS* ""sexy"".

Moffat thinks of the big picture, but not of the little things. Why did the Pandorican Alliance use Amy's memories to create an army of Auton duplicates and presumably the Pandorica? We never get that explanation.

Basically a lot of the ""human"" factor has been dried up with the decision to make the Doctor less relateable and attempt (failingly) to have Amy shoulder the character burden, which would be fine if she herself wasn't being turned from once-interesting promise (a character that has gone a bit batty after the Doctor leaves) to a tired cliche (bossy and indignant ""independent"" woman).

*Moffat* has been the one to nonsensically apply drama, like the whole ""is the Doctor the bay's father"" thing, which literally anyone watching can safely assert ""NO"", but it's still teased to apply needless tacked-on drama.",0,1335301676,null,0,false,0,c4g51g3,t3_smhlx,t1_c4g51g3,t1_c4g4piw,null,1428788440,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The Lodger and Closing Time are excellent examples of people being people, and of the Doctor using people skills. 

Amy had vortex/time whatever energy from the crack in her wall.  

Time of Angels, I sorta agree but she could have had adventures that were not shown as episodes too. So, either or on that one. 

River was dying and the person she cares so much for didn't even know who she was when she saw 10, obviously lots more pain to be felt. 

Amy and Rory's drama is quite similar to Rose and Mickey's. Rory was quite bother by it and only after an adventure with Vampire Fish women did he relize how different things can be. I think it's safe to assume they had some relationship talks outside of what is seen in the episodes.

Unlike Nine and Ten who you would see make friends (like Nine befriending Jabe of Cheem in The End of the World or Ten befriending the couple that won the Lottery in Voyage of the Damned or the pilot in Gridlock) Eleven just *has* friends.

Both in the Lodger and Closing Time characters just say they like the Doctor and him making friends happens offscreen. It's not a skill, it's an informed ability.

In fact, Eleven's rather boorish in those episodes, often ignoring clear signals and in general butting into Craig's life and screwing it up (particularly in The Lodger).

Uhh... That explains nothing. Why would they need her memories when all the Autons needed to do was act as armed guards? I mean, really. They've gone with generic disguises before, why would they take the ridiculous and contrived process of taking Amy's memories (we of course know the reason. It's all just to bring Rory back).

A lot more pain to be felt indeed, but she worked through the pain. She was an image of what was to come, the Doctor's future. She was *so* mysterious and interesting, but that well quickly dried up in this past season.

Suddenly we're expected to believe a girl with a high-school 21ˢᵗ Century education becomes a 51ˢᵗ Century Archaeologist? That her entire background revolves (again) around Amy.

That's why I brought it up. While Mickey and Rose's issues are addressed and explored, most of Rory as a character is left to stagnate. Mickey grew as his own character, Rory is considered a satellite to Amy and virtually every scene he's in is either him bending to her will or trying to save her. Almost every line of dialogue he has revolves around Amy. He's never allowed to develop as a person on his own.

The Pandorican Alliance doesn't shoot the Doctor despite literally every last one of them having the capability and motive to do so and instead place him in a prison that can be opened with a Sonic Screwdriver. Unlike Series Four finale, these are *major* plot-important flaws that make ***even less sense***.

No, it had character taking actions that only served the plot and made no sense. Why would the mother reactivate the drill if she's already in hot water for killing a Silurian? Why would they not simply pull a Weekend at Bernie's or simply leave the body? Why would the Doctor allow Amy (who can't even keep her head up for the duration of the meeting) to take part in a *vital* agreement between humanity and the Silurians?

House prices trebled partly from population pressures but also from the massive increase in BTL via liar loans. BTL takes from housing stock and so puts pressure on prices.

It's a debt cluster-fuck and is utterly unsustainable. It pulls demand forward from the future by assuming prices can rise forever and that a loss will never be made by future owners. Student loans also pull forward demand by injecting 9K into the economy per student per year right now which will then be paid back over 20 years storing trouble up for the future.

Same for PFI where Labour overpaid for schools and hospitals, burdening future generations with a debt mountain.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"I thought I should write while I'm still high on endorphins. I know a lot of our boys abroad will be tearing up Las Ramblas tonight but I'm with my mum and regardless, lots of drunken football fans is rarely my scene. As usual coming from me, expect a verbose response...

Football is a funny old game. At the same time as I have residue of dried tears on my cheeks, my heart is still pumping and my collar wet from the ecstasy of victory. I went in to the match trying to keep the stakes out of my mind, this is a Champions League Semi Final Second Leg, we have a lead and conceded no away goals. We're playing a team that's lost twice in a row, will we see a reaction or is this a more extended sour patch? The first 10 minutes answered any lingering questions. You could count on one hand the number of meaningful possessions we had and my heart sank when Cahill got injured. He'd been immense the last game and we have no backups, short of bringing on Unibrow and moving Branna in

While we had a couple of half-chances, really we didn't threaten until Barca got their goal. Unibrow went missing and Cuenca (I think) got an easy cross in as he was unmarked. The moment of madness came next. I haven't seen what happened properly, I just saw a coming together out of the corner of my eye and Sanchez doing a triple roll on the floor. I assumed from the reaction JT had shanked him then shoved his dick in to the wound. I know the ref was looking the other way and I didn't see the extra officials do anything, I'm pretty sure the ref went on a hunch, taking in to account the player's reaction, the Barca reaction and the crowd's reaction. This is totally wrong. While I'm sure Terry did enough to warrant a red card, you can't just hand these things out without some bloody strong evidence. The decision making process is as important in football as the decision itself

It's fair to say we'd all given up by the time their second went in. Barca fans were screaming all around me, I fucking hated it. The sense of injustice just came flooding back and the way Unibrow and Branna got turned at will was making me fear a cricket score. A moment of inspiration from Frank and Rami and one of the goals of the tournament. It's cliched but if Messi had done that you'd have to wipe ejaculate off camera lenses as commentators around the world partook in some public circlejerking. One of the coolest finishes, all things considered, I've ever seen. Totally changed things around, suddenly we're winning again, it's like we all forgot how slim the margins were

I can't say anything about the second half other than I've never been more proud to be a Chelsea fan. That was perfect. I'm going to gloss over what looked like a huge dive from Cesc (little prick, Lampard 2 - 0 Cesc) and Messi seemed to push Frank high up the chest, maybe on the neck. My God did we defend. I lost count of the positions where Didier popped up, literally an epic performance. I was saying to my mum how we needed to park Torres on the half-way line and just hoof balls in that direction any chance we got. We did it once and well... YES NANDO ,WE FUCKING LOVE YOU SON! I could not be happier for him, he did everything perfectly with that finish. I must say I enjoyed watching the agony of the Barca players when he scored, but I enjoyed the sheer joy on the face of every Chelsea player, staff member and fan

Massive credit to the Barca players and fans tonight. A lot of them applauded our second goal and most of the Barca players stayed behind to congratulate our guys. I think everybody could see that after such a monumental effort we deserved it. While the Barca fans left quickly, I didn't see any Chelsea fans heading out. We stayed behind for about 15 minutes and all the fans in the away section were still singing at the top of the voices.

true,The_Patriarchy,null,null,"&gt;Racism = prejudice + power has been a widely accepted sociological definition 

It's the Critical Theory definition of racism, not the ""sociological definition"", and it's a contended definition at that.

http://www.wetasphalt.com/content/why-racism-prejudice-power-wrong-way-approach-problems-racism


The ""sociological definition"" of racism is as follows:

&gt;&gt;An ideology based on the idea that humans can be separated into distinct racial groups and that these groups can be ranked on a hierarchy of intelligence, ability, morality etc.

http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?term=RACISM

&gt;&gt;Racism is the perception and treatment of a racial or ethnic group, or a member of that group, as intellectually, socially, and culturally inferior to one’s own group. It is more than an attitude; it is institutionalized in society. Racism involves negative attitudes that are sometimes linked with negative behavior. 

http://sociology.about.com/od/R_Index/g/Racism.htm

&gt;&gt;The attributing of characteristics of inferiority to a particular racial category. Racism is a specific form of prejudice focused on race.

The closest thing to honest amiability he shows in that episode is his oblivious conversation with the jewelry lady as he has no idea she assumes he's gay, and he's hardly making her as a friend.

I don't form biases. I just look objectively from one showrunner to another. I know full well that RTD made *massive* mistakes that I personally disagree with. He was far from perfect, and frankly so is Moffat. 

But the key difference between the two is that RTD was willing to have people be the epicenter and really sell their realism while Moffat will concoct grand plans with nary a coherent method of executing them.

I also know that one should go into the past with an open mind to mistakes, but this is the present.

It wasn't a big thing, and I've rarely gone beyond the puke limit. (We all do now and again right?) And I also experienced similar at uni; with drugs and alcohol.

I wish we'd stop all this bullshit 'covering cigarettes' and now asking for ID if you look younger than 25. Actually I contradict myself... I think we SHOULD have 25 + rule outside of pubs.

Pubs should have a 16+ accompanied by a 'responsible' adult. I use responsible in the most sensible case. Youngsters would then be in a controlled environment even if worst came to worst. 

Instead of the scenario we have now of pubs shutting down and cheap as fuck alcohol from supermarkets which gets drunk down bus stops and parks... Which oddly enough ends up causing 'street' problems where there aren't any bouncers.

When bidding for PFI contracts, individual companies will band together in what are called consortia. This is so they are big enough to negotiate with the government on an even footing. Or, as you put it, to go against market forces. Phillip Green (the tory donor) pointed this out in his review of government procurement if you don't take my word for it.

This behaviour is accepted - even encouraged - when it concerns private companies. But when private *individuals* band together to negotiate with the government on an even footing, suddenly they're holding the country to ransom?

Women should *always* report rapes.

I mean, it's totally their decision if they choose not to, but coming forward allows them to seek justice, see the culprit punished and ensure that no-one else is victimised by him. 

If a woman has decided not to report a rape, then that's the end of it. Well, I mean, she can always report it later.

But the idea that she should change her mind because she sees the guy is being prosecuted for raping someone else?     

I don't think that should enter into it.

Her decision not to report the crime in the first place was personal - no-one else's testimony should enter into it. 

There is *nothing shameful* about being raped. I can understand the victim wanting anonymity, but the same should apply to innocent people who have been accused of this crime. 

The idea that more victims will come forward if they hear the same guy has been accused by someone else - that seems like a cop out, to me.

true,Dossena,null,null,"&gt; Liverpool obviously need some attacking players. Creators, not role players.

I don't get this. We're creating a lot of goal scoring opportunities as it is. We already have creators. We need decent finishers and goal scorers. 

Keita is too old and I'd rate a fully fit Lucas (which we'll hopefully have back) above him now in the defensive mid role. 

I'm not American so am not wanking myself silly over Dempsey. He's had a great season, true enough but I don't think he's what we need. Could be good back-up for when Stevie is injured, but he wouldn't settle for that when he can get first team action elsewhere. 

Not to clued up on Martinez, but I see he's a defensive mid/central defender. Perhaps a decent choice for back up to Lucas, but again if we can keep Lucas fit I don't think we'd need him. 


I'd like a new striker to replace Kuyt and/or Bellamy. I don't want either of those two to leave but it's unlikely that we can rely on them now they're both approaching the ends of their career. However I think the Suarez-Carroll partnership is starting to show signs of greatness. So any new striker would have to be happy to sit on the bench. Unless we move Suarez out to the right and find Big Andy a new striking partner up front.  Wouldn't mind Dzeko. Not sure what his future at Man City is looking like (he's not really been in favour for a while) but I like him and think he'd get on the end of the chances we create. 

Would also like a new winger or two. Downing has been alright at best. And we really don't have a right winger (Hendo isn't meant to play there). So unless we start playing Suarez there I'd like to see someone come in. Not sure who.

Tube Automation isn't true automation like the DLR, you'd still need someone there to move it in to and out of depots, to start and stop the train, to stop in emergencies etc., so the drivers wouldn't be gotten rid of, nor would salaries come down as a result of it. They could have tube ""captains"" and have a central control hub, but the benefits of just having someone sit at the front of the train to press a GO button, open and close doors, do announcements etc. is already there, and works.

Tube ""automation"" just means running the trains closer together, better signalling, starting and stopping quicker with less hanging around. Like a robotic highway.

Secondly, this strike is to do with maintenance workers who were part of a private maintenance company (Tube Lines) who had to be saved by TfL. They have kept their previous terms and conditions, but another company, Metronet, who also went bust and were brought back in-house by TfL received pensions, travel concessions and better conditions as a result. The Tube Lines workers want the same thing.

Automating the Tube would not stop this strike from occurring. Also worth noting is that as this issue is only with Tube Lines workers, then not every member is going to bother voting.

An earlier BBC article says that:

&gt;A spokesperson for the union, which represents about 1,000 staff on the Tube Lines contracts, added that workers voted 4-1 to take action.

80% voted for action. Pretty significant.

EDIT: Usually dislike a lot of the militant unions surrounding TfL, but this one is very legitimate in my opinion and I support it. Their jobs shouldn't have been privatised in the first place.",0,1335314547,null,0,true,0,c4g7u5r,t3_sq2oa,t1_c4g7u5r,t3_sq2oa,null,1428789758,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7
true,timelord00,null,null,"Ok so I've been thinking about a crazy interesting way to bring the valeyard back and this is a fine thread to put it out in. 

The Valeyard in my understanding has always been Doctor Midnight. Doctor 12, the Bad Doctor, the bad wolf is you will (doesn't run with a pack). I hope they save that character for the next regeneration. I hope we don't see any of Doctor 12 at all, and skip right to Doc 13. What a twist! The thirteenth hour, the Impossible Doctor. It would be a trip, we could be made to think it was the 12th regeneration and only find out later that one is missing. I imagine that they could make a really bold choice and have this doctor be female, and have the mystery of the series be trying to discover the plans of, and defeat the evil doctor before herself. She knows she does it, or someone does, because she exists. Perhaps due to the severity of the method by which her last regeneration was ended, she could start of with a sort of post regeneration amnesia. This could be a really interesting time to have The Doctor explore space a bit more and get out of England or at least the earths past. This would be troubling for her as in most of Earths past Misogyny would prevent most people from taking a female doctor seriously.  Also we know that something big happens at Tranzalore involving the Doctors name. What if that is the key to opening the timelock on Gallifrey as well? Would the Timelords come back? Could they also be hunting this new Doctor?


I'd also love to see the intro of a companion that finds the Doctor as opposed to the other way around, perhaps someone that runs into the open Tardis to hide from something.

They don't really force you to have 12 hours of class a day or six day weeks, they don't force you to study or learn the material, but it's all still presented to you.  The schools offer you the resources, but not many students take advantage of them.

Personally, as a super nerd, I stayed after school 3 hours a day every day to participate in extra-curricular activities.  I also read all my text books, talked with and emailed my teachers often, and just generally loved learning and feel like I got an exceptional education from American public schools.

But most kids aren't going to do that, and so while I'm not sure what the best approach to education is, I do feel like the public school system does fail a disproportionate amount of kids in offering a good education in comparison to those in many other first world countries.",0,1335324280,null,0,false,0,c4g9wsb,t3_sqfe4,t1_c4g9wsb,t1_c4g9rpb,null,1428790808,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I think one of the things I don't like is how detached the Doctor is from everyone and everything we've gotten to know up until this point. When 10 said goodbye to everyone, he *really* said goodbye to everyone. But they made much of the show, and the people made the Doctor who he was/is.

It's easy to think that Aquilani probably wants a good shot at a first team place to offset the fact that he is homesick. However, we already have a first team attacking midfielder by the name of Steven Gerrard. Henderson is a backup for Gerrard, and he is happy to play on the right wing as well, a position that is terribly unsuitable for Aquilani. 

Having Aquilani will mean that he will alternate with Gerrard, thus leaving Henderson with no chance to play in the center, which is his best position. At the beginning of this season, there was no way of knowing that Gerrard's injury would leave him out for almost half the season. Keeping Aquilani would have been unfair to him, since I think he knows that there is no way of him, or anybody, forcing Gerrard out from his place. 

Next season, however, will be a different issue. For one, Gerrard is showing signs of age after his surgery. Secondly, he will also be tired after EURO. I doubt Aquilani will see much play during Euro, so he will know that he has a good shot at taking the AMC position for the first couple of months of next season. In addition, after 2 failed attempts at getting his loans permanent in Italy, Aquilani might also have resigned himself to the fact that his career is better served in Liverpool than being an unwanted journeyman in Italy.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"There is absolutely no way that Kenny will be sacked. Neither will he be bustled off into a higher position (Director of Football/Talent/Development etc). Why? Because any position that Kenny is in for LFC that is not the manager is a toxic position. 

People forget that Kenny is basically a God for Liverpool. Out of the holy trinity of Shankly, Paisley and Kenny, only he is still alive. If he gets sacked, the next manager will have pressure immeasurable. Any minor mistake/hiccup will see him destroyed by fans and media. You see how the media loves to attack us now, just wait till you see them the day Liverpool sacks their god and saviour. Every little bit about how it is disgraceful to a legend of Dalglish's stature to how he wasn't given enough time will be repeated. Ferguson will surely jump in and point to how his Coca-cola Cup win was the catalyst to his success, inferring that the owners jumped the gun. So many people talk about Rafa returning, but if he couldn't deal with the mind games from Ferguson, he will surely not be able to deal with the media scrutiny post-Dalglish. Want an example? Look at his stint in Inter Milan. 

Getting shuffled upstairs isn't an option either, because the spectre of Dalglish looming over the incoming manager will be too much. The media will scrutinise every single word Dalglish says, trying to find any source of discord between the ""Director"" and the manager. 

The only way for Kenny to leave Liverpool is for him to resign, make a public statement supporting the incoming manager wholeheartedly, then not give any media interviews for a whole year at least. If he comes out and says that he is resigning because he feels inadequate to the task, and mentions that he has recommended so-and-so to take over the mantel and heaps tons of praise on the guy, then there is a chance of a fairly peaceful change at the helm. If not, any change will surely come with a storm of controversy, and that is the last thing the club needs now.

From http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Lord. Time Lord names include:

The Doctor, Susan Foreman (possible alias), The Monk (possible alias), The War Chief, Goth, The Master, Omega, K'anpo Rimpoche, Ferain, Morbius, Borusa, Spandrell, Andred, Romana, Drax, Rassilon, Maxil, Hedin, Flavia, The Rani, Darkel, Engin, Gomer, Kelner, Rodan, Savar, Salyavin, Damon, Talor, Thalia, Zorac, Simpson, Azmael, Berenyi, The Partisan, The Visionary, The Woman, Drall, The Corsair.

I've redacted 2 new series characters who are arguably Time Lords with regeneration powers (blond soldier chick from the Tennant days, and the one from series 6). 

Basically, there's a lot of Time Lords with less descriptive names, or names which may be in another language. Maybe they just choose something that sounds good.

The War Chief was known as Magnus, before he turned renegade. Perhaps it's renegades often change their name to ""The Noun"". Other renegades are The Monk, The Master and The Rani.

Much of the technology is fairly new though and I'm sure there are greater efficiencies to be had, so I am all in favour of continuing to develop and install wind turbines. But I fully agree that they need to be part of a wider strategy that includes nuclear, solar &amp; tidal power, as well as a big focus on energy consumption reduction. 

IMHO much of the problem is that the economic framework really is adapted to big power generation schemes, whereas widely distributed smaller scale schemes fit better with renewables.

4th. Back up for LB - Baines (Well, BAE would prob be back up for a player like Baines)

5th. Back up for LW and RW. - Hoillet and Moses?

6th. Give VdV some competition. When he is fit he walks into the team, let's get a creative midfielder that also knows how to score. A silva type player.... Any suggestions?

ALL of this needs to happen AFTER we find a new management team that have a game plan. A plan of the football we want to play without deviating away from the way Spurs have played football in the last 60 years.

We need to increase our wage cap too. We are getting left behind and before we know it the board at THFC will be thinking 'Shit, maybe we have run with the times'. I'm not saying splash out and put the club at financial risk but lets try and compete a little bit more.

- They're ugly - a subjective opinion, plus the offshore and miles away argument from before applies here too.

- They produce next to no electricity - so that's why Denmark make over 20% of their supply from them then?

- They are expensive - They are currently around level with gas power plants.  They are not liable to go up in price and have been steadily (and quite dramatically) reducing in price.  Gas and coal are liable to go up in price with their fuel

- They don't run when it's not windy enough - well obviously, but it's not windy enough less than 10% of the time in a good location.

- They don't run when it's too windy - again true, but winds of that speed are very very rare

- They are built on land seized by the government - not true, in fact the majority of production planned to be in place by around 2020 is on the crown estate

- They damage the environment - They do very little damage to the environment, certainly a lot less than a coal or gas power plant.  Often the land around them is either used for agriculture or redeveloped as parkland.  The impact on birds is minimal to zero (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17694256)

Anything good to say?

- they are a proven low carbon source of energy that will help us meet the 2050 targets
- They are not expensive and are the only viable power source currently making large reductions in their cost
- They are cheaper than nuclear once you remember to factor in the decommissioning costs.

This appears to be what logic and reason would dictate and personally I have nothing against it, but I can hardly see most people taking that view in which case I think it is better to just legalise everything and let it all be sold.

In the case of psychological addiction, the addiction is essentially a choice and so I think it should be sold and people should be allowed to make responsible decision for themselves - the state is not a childminder after all.

Also I maintain the belief that in the age of medicinal chemistry and modern drug design it must surely be possible to maximise the benefits that people want from certain drugs (elation, etc.) whilst minimising the negative sides (loss of self control, aggression, addiction etc.) and this would be profitable for companies as people don't want to use harmful substances if equally good non-harmful substances are available.

So whilst I do think it would require regulation, I don't see why it would be any worse than the current trades in alcohol and tobacco.",0,1335350288,null,0,false,0,c4gd6jw,t3_sqfzs,t1_c4gd6jw,t1_c4gd160,null,1428792345,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Fortunately, that didn't take place this time, so we have what is now a fairly mild, if long running recession instead of a Depression.

We're not out of the woods yet. 

One of the problems with the Great Depression was the use of the Gold Standard, which meant that the money supply couldn't easily be expanded - this led to deflation when it couldn't keep up with real growth, and meant that there was little incentive for creditors to create loans, as the money would be worth more in the future anyway, with no risk.

Now to avoid this, we use a fiat currency, which expands through the fractional reserve system with loans - so that it always expands with the growth of the economy. However, the problem is that the application of interest requires a constant rate of inflation to prevent systemic defaults (as there isn't enough money in circulation to pay back all the loans with interest), and this means that the government must take on greater debt to expand the monetary supply to prevent economic collapse.

Of course, the situation is absurd, because you can't just keep taking on debt, as eventually it is clear that the repayments cannot be made, and no profit will be made by the creditors.

We've had easy credit and encouraged the use of credit to expand the economy, but it's built on a house of cards, for it can never be repaid with interest (especially as we begin to hit physical growth limits).  Really we are just putting off a great collapse of this debt-based system, either through recessions and a collapse in the economy through austerity (which will also cause a collapse in confidence), or a union of indebted nations refusing to pay the debt when it reaches absurd levels (see Ecuador for example).",0,1335350769,null,0,false,0,c4gd7v9,t3_sri4h,t1_c4gd7v9,t1_c4gctaf,null,1428792362,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

His quote 

&gt; “Just as prohibition of alcohol failed in the United States in the 1920s, the war on drugs has failed globally. Over the past 50 years, more than $1 trillion has been spent fighting this battle, and all we have to show for it is increased drug use, overflowing jails, billions of pounds and dollars of taxpayers’ money wasted, and thriving crime syndicates. It is time for a new approach.”

And that was all during the same match.

He then blew my mind when I found out he was a thoroughbred STRIKER.

He can defend. He can tackle. He can pass across the field. He can run past defenders. He can put in a perfect cross. He can smash them from outside of the box. He can beat the keeper and three other defenders from within 3 yards off either foot. He can climb through the air and bang them in off his head.

And when all hope is lost and everybody seemed like there was nothing left to fight for, this man would just continue to run. And run. And run. And run. And score. And win.

If these rumors really true, I won't lie, I'm going to be devastated. I've been waiting years for the chance to see him play in person and now I know that chance may never come.

The UK economy is among the worst in Europe and has been since they took power, nothing to do with Labour, everything to do with their political mantra and policies.

&gt; But in the long term, it's hard to see how you can argue with austerity as the way to balance the books and get our country's finances back from the brink.

Well if our finances are on the brink, so are America, Germany and France and Canada, if you measure by debt alone.  

Debt is normal, the UK's increased significantly after 2008 as did most other countries as they tried to stimulate their economies back to growth.

The tories put a kybosh on all that and told THE GREAT LIE we are out of money and we must cut spending, which is simply not true. The media and the country swallowed it whole. Historically we have had far higher debt levels than we do today. If you measure it as percentage of GDP it is not so bad at all

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_national_debt

Americas is currently over 100% of their GDP

http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/

It is useful when talking about debt to have some sources so here are two that you can use for comparison

http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=143&amp;c=gm&amp;l=en

Francois Hollande is correct, we must stimulate growth and employment right now, austerity is causing great hardship, and causing the economies to weaken. The way to do that is public investment, investment in infrastructure is a normal mechanism. 

The conservatives are liars, they lie every day to us, they have not told the truth about our finances, their political mantra simply will not stimulate economy during a recession, but just like when thatcher was in power, they use the weakness in the economy to  hive off well functioning and profitable parts of the public services that operate well to the private sector. As David Cameron ""Its all up for sale"". It's in their interests for the economy to tank further so they can sell off more, and persuade the country this is what we have to do to fix the economy.  

The long term impact is services that belong to the country end up being run for a profit and we get no benefit. Typically these sales  get owned by foreign institutions which hurts our bottom line even further.

Okay, deep breath, Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine.

Levy can be frustrating as a fan, but he understands how to balance bringing in talent without breaking the bank. On the other hand it would be nice to get someone who would make a move before the final 5 minutes of a transfer window.

1. We absolutely need 2 strikers and seem to be rumored at any given time to every striker in Europe yet never pull the trigger. Lllorente, Rmey, Damiao, Van Wolfswinkel,Giroud, Dumbia all the older strikers in Serie A, Levy needs to pick 2 and go get them.

2. Caulker needs to come back, Vertongen would be great, Douglas (from FC Twente) would both fit the type of spending that Levy does.

3. Sell Modders, i like him and whether its been Harry putting him on the wing or disinterest to be blamed but he has looked like garbage during the slump. Marin, Marvin Martin would fit, would love to see us try for someone like Thiago Alcantara but that is true day dreaming.

4. I think we can get by with a player like Rose as a backup to BAE, may be able to use Naughton to do this when he comes back from Norwich

5. Hoillet is a must do for us during the summer, i can't believe we didn't even make an offer on him during the Jan window. Krasic would be another one we could make another try for.

6.  This is a hard one, i just don't know that there are any midfielders floating around of this calibre that we would actually break the bank for. Hernanes may fit the bill, Hazard could potentially move to that role....both are well out of our price range (regardless of what Hazard says).

Really we have to get much better at working within the windows, Newcastle (aside from a really terrific job in getting players to play within their system) played our Transfer game and did it far better than us...they brought in Cabaye, Cisse, Ba,Ben Arfa on the cheap....we brought in Nelsen, Saha, Parker and Ade...PArker is great but looks a bit worn out, Ade has been hit or miss.....Newcastle hit on their signings we missed on half.",0,1335360399,null,0,false,0,c4ge8s2,t3_srhg4,t1_c4ge8s2,t1_c4gd33v,null,1428792853,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

true,JB_UK,null,null,"The level of debate about wind turbines is absolutely lamentable. People think because it's a bit technical they can basically make stuff up to support their preconceptions. I'm looking at you, *Telegraph Blogs writer 6 months out of English Lit at Oxford, whose major qualification on the subject is a B in GCSE Physics*. Although the other side aren't so much better. So I thought I'd do a bit of a breakdown, with at least some impartial sources:

**Cost**

There's a good table giving cost estimates for nuclear, coal, gas and wind for the UK [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#UK_2010_estimates), from a Parsons Brinckerhoff report. Other than that, I've also copied out [two graphs from the report by Mott Macdonald](https://imgur.com/a/FvYJg), listed on that page, for costs in 2009 and 2023. As you can see from either source (both international engineering companies) even without any consideration of CO2, onshore wind is competitive with nuclear, and not much more expensive than either Gas or Coal. Taking into account CO2, it is the cheapest of the lot. Offshore is expensive now, but is projected to be competitive in ten or fifteen years.

**Intermittency**

This is the major problem. Saying that 'the wind always blows somewhere' isn't enough, because weather systems often affect an entire continent. And you can't just mash together various intermittent power sources, and end up with baseload power, let alone something which can respond to demand. If you superimpose two unrelated but intermittent sources of power, it is inevitable that sometimes two troughs in generation will coincide with a peak in demand, and the aggregate power will be nowhere near enough to prevent black-outs (there was a quantitative study published recently to this effect, but unfortunately I can't find it at the moment). For those occasions you will always need a certain amount of backup capacity from power plants that can be switched on and off at will.*

But, to my mind, there's an easy solution. Look back at the Mott estimates above. Gas power plants cost very little to build and maintain, the vast majority of the cost is buying fuel. So you could keep enough gas stations in reserve to entirely replace renewable generation capacity if necessary, and use the renewable sources to displace the need to run them for most of the year. If the renewables cost less than the fuel price, this strategy would actually save money. And, of course, it would shield you from fluctuations in the global gas markets, or from any future price increases.

**Looks/Noise**

Obviously it's pretty subjective, but I talked to a Dutch friend yesterday, and she said that on the continent they build lines of turbines along motorways. I thought that was a pretty neat idea. It would rule out the noise issue, and would massively reduce the number of pylons which would have to be built across the countryside. I can understand people that don't want turbines built in rural, undeveloped areas, but I think built along motorways, they would make the environment look better, not worse. I say this as someone who lives in a semi-rural area less than a mile from the motorway.

**Tl;dr**

Wind isn't perfect, but it is quite cheap. I reckon boost up nuclear from 20% to 40-50%, with the rest renewables (tidal, wind, solar) backed up by gas.

*Edit: Some people say we can just use massive batteries, but they fail to realize just how absurdly expensive it would be to have the necessary capacity. Batteries, and to a certain extent pumped storage, are for smoothing out hour to hour intermittency.

Water is surprisingly bad at getting things wet, so on baked dry land, it _doesn't_ fall into the tiny cracks, and filter along.  Instead, it just runs off (often taking a thin layer of soil with it).

To rehyrdate the ground, you need about a week of solid drizzle. Heavier than that, and the water won't end up in reservoirs, instead it just runs off, and gets dumped (because there's not much else you can do with it.)

Periods of baking hot weather punctuated with short bursts of heavy rain is pretty much the _worst_ weather for water management.  You have to deal with drought and floods - _and_ people don't realise the problem with the reservoirs, and are not as conservative with water as they are without the heavy rain.

edit: The reason for including Torres instead of Drogba was to provide an alternative theory based on the thought/hypothesis that we can create quick outlets for through-passes on the counter-attack. Malouda has been pretty good as a midfield-passer.

I have observed that Lamps works better with Ramires as the ""midfield-runner"" who eventually creates the final assist for Drogba when we play long-ball counter-attacks. I have also observed that Mata does not perform as well as we expect him in the same style - he needs spaces and possession to thrive and work his magic. 

This setup is somewhat of a combination that provides a little of both styles - possession and counter-attack. Lampard feeding the overlapping Cole and a marauding Sturridge provide the counter-attacking threats while Mata's deft touches in the midfield combined with Malouda's passing percentage might provide the incisive through-passes through possession. In either of these scenarios, Mikel must drop down to CB to help the backline in stemming Ronaldo's breezy runs down the centre of the pitch.

The threat? Sturridge looking for the incisive through-passes and Torres trying to put himself at the end of a long-ball counter-attack.

The Grid only pays the renewable operators to reduce supply after all the bids from the fossil operators have been accepted (the fossil bids are actually negative, since the fossil operators save money when they don't generate).

At the end of the day, that when supply into the Grid exceeds demand, the supply *must* be reduced. The renewable companies are taking advantage of the fact that the Grid is a bit shit.

The paragraph that presumably sparked the story reads:

&gt; What has become clear over the last year is that the amount charged by wind farms is very significantly in excess of the value of the subsidies foregone. For example, the average price paid to Scottish wind farms to reduce output in 2011 was £220 per MWh, whereas the lost subsidy is approximately £55 per MWh. The amount paid by conventional plant such as coal and gas was approximately £34 per MWh to reduce output in 2011. Ultimately the cost of balancing electricity is paid by the electricity consumer so this large difference in cost is not in the consumer interest.

It then goes on to note that this is just based off the publicly-available information, and that there are further contracts with generators that are not in the public domain. It goes on to state that more transparency is needed, which is probably a good idea.

Note: I haven't looked into REF to see who funds it, etc, so read the page bearing in mind that it may very well be funded by the oil companies!

true,Jafit,null,[Woolyback],"I work in commercial property so let me give you some unsolicited advice.

There may be an audience for this kind of thing, but you're going to need a solid business plan and funds if you want to own a bar.

Due to the costs involved with marketing and leasing a commercial property you're looking at a minimum of a 3 year lease, doing it for less than that is rarely worth the effort. If I were a landlord and owned a property in town I'd only care about whether or not the tenant can actually pay the rent for the duration of their lease. So when deciding whether to accept an offer or not, the covenant strength of the prospective tenant is a major consideration. Are they going to pay the rent, or are they going to go under after 3 months and disappear after I've paid the agent's and solicitor's fees, and leave me back where I started having to put it back on the market again? 

Regular normal bars are known to work and there are plenty of experienced operators around. On paper though your covenant strength doesn't look all that promising, because it's a new venture, has a niche market and (I'm assuming) you're not an experienced operator. You're going to need more than an online survey to show a landlord that you're serious.

So I think a better approach would be to do something similar to the Super Effective Sunday events that used to happen in the CUC. Rent somewhere to host a gaming event (preferably a bar), get people to attend and make some money. Grow it to the point where you can go to the bank for funds and you can go to landlords for a lease on a bar as an established business that has proven it has a customer base and income. 

So while I would like to see such a thing, you'll need more than an online survey conducted in a subreddit with less than 500 subscribers to see whether or not it's viable.",0,1335366772,null,0,false,0,c4gfgfj,t3_srn8d,t1_c4gfgfj,t3_srn8d,null,1428793427,8,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,8

This is rather bizarre. Nuclear power stations only get built if the operating company is indemnified by the government against any disaster, which amounts to a massive subsidy on the insurance which would otherwise be required. Sellafield clean-up costs are going to end up at about £80bn, which will be paid for by the government. Also, governments usually have to guarantee in advance that they'll buy the energy at a preset price for the lifetime of the plant.

true,Query3,null,null,"Oxford, strictly speaking, doesn't actually offer an M.A. course, but they do  offer the nine-month M.St. (taught) and the two-year M.Phil. (taught &amp; research). There are also several different sub-disciplines (Modern British &amp; European, American, Economic &amp; Social), so figure out which you're most interested in before you apply. The M.Phil. requires quite a lot of independent research and is geared to prepare people for the full D.Phil.; the M.St., on the other hand, requires a much smaller dissertation and could be considered an 'extra year' of teaching after the B.A. 

These days there usually isn't an in-person interview, but they're not out of the question. You'll be asked to submit writing samples; if I recall correctly, you have the option of submitting two ~2,500-word pieces or one ~5,000-word piece. It can be useful to the Faculty, though it's not necessary, if the samples are related to the interests you'll be asked to mention in your personal statement. The most important factor in admittance will likely by the three references you'll need to provide, but hopefully your Open University tutors will be willing to write good ones! Also make sure to look into which college you want to apply to, the main difference between them being accommodation provision (and occasionally, minor scholarships). You can also apply 'open', in which case you'll be assigned a college by the Faculty.

Both degrees above are also available part-time, if I recall correctly, if you want to work on the side as well. As Greeney mentioned, funding is key: don't expect much from Oxford (there isn't a whole lot these days, especially with AHRC cuts, and it's mostly reserved for research students) but if you have your own funds that should help a lot.

true,DVD773,uk,United Kingdom,"I don’t know how much of this is common knowledge but I thought I would list a few facts about wind farms. 
Wind power is very unpredictable; this aside from the obvious causes several things:

The National Grid has to get other power stations to run on standby when it is using wind farm power.  Usually gas or coal plants, this requires them to be running and burning fuel to be able to response fast enough should they have to compensated for and shortfall in wind power. 

Their unpredictability means that the electricity produced by wind farms is worth less on the market compared to the same amount from other sources. 
In fact the only reason the National Gird uses wind power is to aperies environmental group and because it earns them carbon credits. 

Carbon credits are a currency for carbon emission offset. Organisations are bound by law to be carbon neutral. Running wind farms (even with fossil fuel on standby) saves them having to by these credits on the market. The system is broken anyway as you can sell credits on the basis that you plan to plant 2000 trees in the future allowing companies to generate capital for nothing but that is a rant for another time.

Anyway there is a few reasons why people don’t like wind power.

*4)Baines won't come to us as a backup.  The key here is to get a young kid to deputize to BAE.  Rose hasn't done a bad job.
*5) Agree.
*6) He does have competition.  Krancjar is perfect for that player in the hole.  The problem is that VDV and Modric are our only genuine world class players.  I don't but Bale in that category.

I don't think we need to make wholesale changes in the player dept.  This is the same team that was knocking on the Manchester's door.  It's management and having capable backups.

that's ""north west infidels infiltrate the UAF"". http://www.facebook.com/pages/North-West-Infidels-Manchester/153914484724189 You'll note the nice friendly reply from MfE.  That's a pretty clear link with a group of football hooligans.  It also indicates that there could be some substance to the claims that the UAF are occasionally being set up.  This site, well very lefty, does run through some EDL and far right links pretty nicely http://malatesta32.wordpress.com/2010/10/16/the-edl-are-nazis/

Well known members of the EDL were at the head of the march.  It was promoted heavily on the Casuals United blog -a group of football hooligans.  The EDL are known to have ties to far right groups both here and in Europe.  this has a good sort of potted history of the EDL http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Enemies-not-Allies-web-version1.pdf. here's a link to one of the EDL sites advertising attendance at the March For England: http://edl-nottingham.co.uk/march-for-england-sunday-april-22nd/ 

Reading the comments on the Argus and other local news sources often finds many March For England people saying things like ""this is not an EDL event, but wait until we come down for an EDL event when we won't have women and children with us, then we'll give a kicking!""  

There's regular use of racist terminology (ie muzzies, pakis, etc) on both EDL and March for England sites.  they often say ""muslim is not a race"" but it's clear that they ALSO hold racist views, and are certainly opposed to religious freedom.  The EDL were founded by members of Combat18 and other openly racist groups.

I  am totally with you in that i don't think it's right to prevent them from holding their march with violence, but I do think that if you believe in religious freedom and a diverse society you should show your opposition.  It's important not just to offer support to others in opposing the far right, but also to show those who are being discriminated against that they ARE'NT hated in England. That's why I was not willing to be involved with groups trying to prevent the march, but was at Victoria Gardens.

I say that in the loosest sense. She's working at Alt Torchwood and he's *the Doctor*. In fact, there's a deleted scene that RTD considers to have happened where Metacrisis Doctor gets a chunk of the TARDIS and instructions on how to build it quickly.

I actually think that New Who's dance with the mundane has been mixed. Usually it's the Doctor symbolically fighting the mundane.

In The Long Game it's mass media. In Bad Wolf it's reality television. In School Reunion it's against the school principal. In The Idiot's Lantern it's television. In Fear Her it's daddy issues in a single home. In Gridlock it's traffic. 

There's load of stuff in which the Doctor literally says that people have the choice of living boring and ordinary lives of getting up to work and eating chips or grabbing life by the horns and living it.

He's waffled between saying ordinary people are brilliant and it's a life a bit of him actually longs for (I believe he actually says that normal is alright by him a few times. He seems to be perfectly fine with shooting the breeze with some friends over chips in Cardiff in Boom Town) and saying that normal is boring.

Huh? Business isn't conducted at gunpoint in America... what the fuck are you talking about?

&gt; And when they aren't the Police sort it out, no need for guns.

How long do the police take to respond? If somebody is actively breaking into your home or assaulting you, even 3 minutes is far too long to wait for police to arrive. I can draw my handgun in under a second.

&gt; I read that murders are committed almost always by someone the target knows, how much easier would it be to kill someone with guns?

I don't know... if I were planning to kill somebody I think I would far prefer to be armed with a knife knowing they were completely unarmed if the alternative were being armed with a firearm and also knowing they were armed with a firearm.

&gt; The murder rate in the USA is 4x what it is (here), how many of those deaths wouldn't have occurred if guns weren't readily available?

That's evidence of absolutely nothing.
