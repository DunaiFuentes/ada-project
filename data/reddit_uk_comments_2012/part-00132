true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; According tone of the PDFs on that website there are about 4,000 people that sleep rough and roughly 90,000 statutory homeless.

You're going to get people who slip through the cracks, or who refuse all help offered to them, under any welfare system. 

We have a comprehensive welfare system in the UK. Even taking the larger figure of 90,000 statutory homeless people, in a country with a population of roughly 60 million that's a slipping-through-the-cracks figure. 0.15 percent.

&gt; How would you solve the problem of homeless people? Criminalising them when they have the sense to squat over sleeping on the streets where if the weather and rats don't kill them the crime will. The people interviewed in the article even said that they weren't causing a problem. If you were in this situation what would you do?

I'd recognise that we're dealing with two separate issues here. 

On the one hand, we have a national housing crisis, where the stock of housing is far too small and not enough new homes are being built. We have areas of the country where the average house price is now 20 times the average wage. 

This is a real issue and one that we ought to tackle with legislative changes, such as cutting red tape preventing new homes being built, telling the NIMBY folk where to shove it, and even allowing more development on greenfield land. 

You think it's absurd we have lots of empty homes. I think it's absurd we have impossible house prices, yet mile after mile of countryside we could be building new homes on. Yes, it looks pretty, but thousands upon thousands of families can't afford to get on the property ladder, and that's more important than a field to walk your dog in.

On the other hand, we have homelessness, which typically has nothing to do with the housing crisis. There are very few people out there who are homeless simply because they cannot afford a place to live. We have housing benefit specifically for this purpose. We have countless government bodies and charities focused on providing accommodation for homeless people, putting them in public housing, looking after them while they are in transition, etc. This system isn't perfect, but nothing is. Some people can and do fall through the cracks here, and I recognise that.

Most of the time homelessness is the result of deeper issues, such as mental health problems or drug (especially alcohol) addiction. Homelessness is often a lifestyle 'choice'. A lot of people would rather live on the streets — earning an income from begging or prostitution, and spending their money on alcohol — than be holed up in a shelter or halfway house where alcohol is prohibited.

These are separate issues. Easing the housing crisis isn't going to eliminate homelessness. Even an unlimited amount of charitable assistance wouldn't eliminate homelessness completely.",0,1348840716,null,0,1348841039,0,c6entj4,t3_10lvq1,t1_c6entj4,t1_c6en87h,null,1435681444,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I started working in Security in 2006. I left my job in the July but didn't start at my new job until the September due to the CRB check and security vetting that needed to be completed.

I went in to the Jobcentre, initially to enquire about my NI payments as this would be the first time I would be ""unemployed"" since I was 16 (I was 26 at the time) so even though it was only 8 weeks I wanted to make sure it was paid. 

I ended up coming out with an appointment to claim Jobseekers Allowance after being told, even though I the job offer from my new employer was a cert, that I may as well ""claim all I can"" in the 8 weeks I had to wait for the CRB to be completed

It does.

Which is a byproduct of our media, the hyperbole ridden bullshit merchants of ""democracy"". So we have political parties and people who's main focus is on how much people like them rather than what solutions need to be used.

I get what you're saying, but heck to sort out the world's plights does not take any kind of economic genius. It is fairly obvious that there are instances of tyranny and greed which trouble every aspect of the world.

As an example of this, the United Nations did a report (I cannot find it, if you want me to source it I will but I loaned the book to somebody whom I'd have to ask) that found that it would take $40 billion to sort out water, food, clothing, shelter, and basic reproductory diseases within females in 3rd world countries. In comparison to that, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the USA more than *1 Trillion Dollars* ([source](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/26/afghanistan-iraq-usa-cost-idUSN2611591520100126)).

Whether or not you agree with the wars, you cannot argue that that is absurd.

The relevance of this to the squatting/homeless situation isn't great, but my point is, there is enough wealth, food, clothing, jobs, to sort EVERYONE out. It is a select few that are reaping the benefits of this grand unbalance and inequality.

true,InsufferableTwat,null,null,"I started my business after a few months on the rock n roll about ten years ago. I grant you things may (should) have changed since then, but at the time the jobcentre were as much use as a bucket of cold piss. 

All available grants for startup (I was flat broke) were from the local council, and you can probably imagine the restrictions &amp; admin nonsense involved in that, and how helpful, understanding, imaginative and positive the local council staff were... hahaha.

Fortunately I'd bought a computer (which was a lot of fucking money to me back then) while I'd been in my last job. I put a business plan together &amp; scraped together about £1.5k for a car &amp; some bits of kit from a Princes Trust loan and a bank loan. The business plan was bullshit - obviously, this is true at every level of industry - but I paid both loans off once I got going.

The trouble is, once you start down that road, if you *fail* - if you don't get the contracts, or your knackered fifth-hand Escort becomes unrepairable - the job centre will give you every conceivable hindrance and no help *whatsoever*. You will have to fight like a tiger to get housing benefit back, for example. 

In my case the gamble paid off, but I wonder how many people quite reasonably don't take that leap, because it's risking too much. Because the JC make self-employment a no-going-back sort of deal, people will quite rationally stay where they are (costing the taxpayer money) rather than risk the roof over their heads. 

(may be worth mentioning that like OP I had a really decent landlord at the time, who let me owe him about a quarter of my rent every week that HB wouldn't cover after I lost my job. Yes I paid him back too. Knackered government institutions aside, it really helps when people look out for one another as well, it's not a bad country if we all do that sort of thing.)

true,e_d_a_m,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottm.,"Well, first, I should state up front that I'm talking philosophically here. From a legal point of view, the situation *is* clear, it seems.

For me, the counter argument comes down to this (and please just humour me here for a second): What if one person owned *all* the property in the UK and rented it out, but for a *ridiculous* amount (i.e., a rent that most people couldn't afford)? This is clearly not an ethically justifiable situation. It clearly wouldn't be reasonable to expect the majority of the country to accept that they can no longer live in houses, which are all sitting there empty, because they aren't wealthy enough. It would be so grossly unfair that one person owned so very much and left so many homeless that, regardless of whether the owner *did* own all the property, the fact that they owned it would cease to be justification enough to prevent people from using it.

Now, I realise that this is an extreme position and is not at all like what is going on in the UK. But I wanted to make the point that there *is a point* at which ""it's property, therefore it's theft!"" is too simple-a-description of the situation.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Well you do only own stuff by the leave of others

No, you own stuff and people generally agree with and adhere to this concept. There's a difference.

&gt;specifically a government with enough violence to enforce its leave on us.

No, the courts enforce laws designed to protect ownership via the police. Not sure where 'a government' comes into it in this instance.

&gt;There is nothing inate to your property that makes it yours

And there's nothing inate that gives you the right to take what you like.

&gt;you simply have an agreement with the government that they will be violent to varying degrees if someone tries to take it

No, you don't - this happens whether you agree or not, and it's not 'simply' unless you have your own agenda to push. And (again) it happens via courts, not the government. And fines are 'violent' now?

&gt; and in exchange you will give them money

Nope, you give them money anyway, for many different reasons. Unless you're trying to overlay your own agenda.

&gt;and do what they tell you to

Really? At this point it becomes agenda-stealing drivel.

&gt;This is entirely artificial.

Any human construct is entirely artificial. Doesn't make it optional.

&gt;Plenty of societies have had it, far more haven't.

How many societies don't have ownership or pay taxes?

&gt;When you base your argument on this being some kind of immutable law, you might as well argue capital punishment on the basis of it being illegal now.

You mean instead of attempting to justify theft by trying to ridicule/ dismiss the entire premise of law, ownership and taxes by using convenience-logic, reductionism and such?

I understand there is a shortage of public housing, that waiting lists are long and it can often take a long time to get into permanent public housing, but by and large that isn't the reason people rough it on the streets.

Generally speaking, if you cannot afford for accommodation in this country, you will have accommodation of some form (whether temporary council accommodation, a hostel, or even a B&amp;B) paid for. A few people slip through the cracks every now and then, but generally it's pretty simple. 

Very, very few people, if any, have no other option but to sleep on the streets. It takes a real perfect storm for that to be your only option.

In fact, there aren't even that many genuinely homeless people. A lot of people assume there are more because begging is prolific in a lot of cities, but the link between begging and homelessness is tenuous. 

Genuinely homeless people only make up around 0.15 percent of the population, and I'm willing to bet that in most of those cases there are other factors influencing their homelessness, most commonly mental health issues or drug addiction.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; We have a comprehensive welfare system in the UK. Even taking the larger figure of 90,000 statutory homeless people, in a country with a population of roughly 60 million that's a slipping-through-the-cracks figure. 0.15 percent.

There are even more people living on the edge of homelessness and we have a welfare system that is being dismantled by the same government that is making it illegal to find an unoccupied building and making it a squat. 

Did they try talking to the guy? Asking if he was willing to clean up any mess and move on to a shelter? It seems like they just locked him up; making it even harder for him to ever find work and get out of poverty. When he's done in prison do you think the welfare state will just give him a break?

We have a pretty good legal system that lets you sue for damages that have been done - how about using that instead of making laws about squatters?

This law is a perfect example of how the criminal justice system is perverted to protect the interests of the wealthy. If it was about justice we wouldn't make homeless people criminals, we'd acknowledge that there was an issue and try to come up with a solution that benefited both sides. Instead we go ""NO, he's a Criminal. End of story."" and continue to ignore the problem.

&gt; Most of the time homelessness is the result of deeper issues, such as mental health problems or drug (especially alcohol) addiction. Homelessness is often a lifestyle 'choice'. A lot of people would rather live on the streets — earning an income from begging or prostitution, and spending their money on alcohol — than be holed up in a shelter or halfway house where alcohol is prohibited.

Have you ever tried speaking to a homeless person, got any statistics on this claim? Becasue this just seems like idle speculation you've gotten from a cosy middle class up bringing. Maybe there is the noble hobo that wants to live of the land as a free man (and why can't they?) but every homeless person I've met has got there through a bad turn of luck or drug addiction. I haven't met many, but I've certainly never heard them utter a phrase that indicates a high degree satisfaction with their place in the world.

&gt; Easing the housing crisis isn't going to eliminate homelessness.

I don't care about people being able to buy houses; I was using the statistic to demonstrate we have enough land, and unoccupied homes and wealth for these people to live in but we're more concerned with protecting private property than helping anyone.",0,1348847554,null,0,false,0,c6eph62,t3_10lvq1,t1_c6eph62,t1_c6entj4,null,1430013430,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Yes, technically she's under-age, but let's not pretend that she's some 10 year old. She's probably more mature than many a few hundred days older than her. There isn't some cut-off point at 16 where you magically change from child to adult.

He had sent the messages to all his contacts on his mobile, including members of his family. **The complainants had received messages of a sexual nature from the defendant on more than one occasion**. Following a contested trial, the defendant was convicted with two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity contrary to s 10(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. At sentencing, the judge remarked that the defendant had breached trust being one of the coaches of the swimming club and that there was a significant age difference between the defendant and the complainants. The defendant, who had no previous convictions, was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. The defendant appealed against the sentence.
He contended that the judge had erred by imposing an immediate prison sentence and should have imposed a suspended sentence. Moreover, he contended that the sentence had been manifestly excessive. Consideration was given to the Sentencing Guidelines Council's guidelines for offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (the sentencing guidelines).""

true,majypoo,kernow,Cornwall,"Newquay is suffering badly, I have lived here most of my life. The town has an identity crises at the moment and doesn't know what it wants to be. The majority of the locals would like a return to the family holiday, as this doesn't bring the wave of trouble in the summer. This is virtually impossible now that most of the family friendly hotels have all gone out business and Newquay now has a reputation. 

The town centre has become a dump, there is no reason for a local to even enter the town these days. There is nothing there apart from surf shops, kebab houses and poundland. The council need to step up and give the town centre a make over like they did in St Austell but I doubt it will happen under a recession. 

Half the hotels are falling down or closing, they haven't upgraded as they don't get the business these days. Most of the youngsters that come down to Newquay stay in the camp sites or surf lodges and this has made a right eye sore for the town.

The locals want peace and quiet in the town centre without the stags/hens but the town is setup to cater for that so any big changes soon would be another economic blow for the area that is hit hard in winter when it goes quiet. 

Whilst I disagree with the principle of banning such clothing I do understand peoples concerns when they are taking their children to town and see a man dressed with next to nothing on. 

It's a shame Newquay has gone the way it has, I would say it has one of the most beautiful coastlines in Europe and this has been spoilt due to the reputation of the town.

If I was a single man living alone, I might consider a confrontation like this.  But with children and family, I refuse to risk their safety to preserve that of the intruder.  If I am unable to ""restrain, disable, and incapacitate"" the intruder as you mentioned, then I leave my family defenseless; something I could never do, regardless of how difficult it may be to take a life.  Also, you fail to recognize that your attempts to safely disable an intruder are dependent upon them not having or using a firearm as well, what chance do you think you have against an armed assailant?  

This conversation really peaked my interest so I stopped by the local police department yesterday to find out exactly what my rights are.  As it turns out, if an intruder has broken into your house, and appears capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm, use of deadly force IS justified and in fact recommended.  They also expressed to me that the notion of disabling an assailant yourself is the pinnacle of naivety.  While all confrontation should be avoided if possible, (I am assuming that this hypothetical situation is one where fleeing is beyond the realm of possibilities) one should not attempt to ""go hands on"" as they put it.  This is especially true of gang-heavy states such as the one I live in, where multiple armed assailants are likely.


I am very pleased with this conversation.  It was an exchange of conflicting ideas and opinions that did not devolve into an argument. Thank you.

Look at how this case was treated.

How would I handle this sort of situation? Oversight, with the intent to protect, instead of harm as we currently do.

They really are inflated. In other countries where they had a housing bubble (take the US for instance), they let it deflate significantly. House prices there have fallen to somewhere approaching long term inflation-adjusted prices. Here, we have a vastly bloated financial industry and we didn't allow this deflation, that's why we've printed far more money than anyone else as a proportion of our GDP. I honestly can't believe that you think that we didn't have a housing bubble, because that's what you're implying. 

&gt; In short, the idea that banks would suddenly go on a huge lending spree in response to QE (required for actual monetary inflation) is nonsense if their balance sheets are truly so fragile, and given that there was very little effect on lending from previous QEs seems to show that it is empirically false.

The problem is not necessarily the time when they're repairing their balance sheets, but there will come a point in the future when they start lending again and all these reserves that they're building-up are released and leveraged, and the velocity will increase significantly.

Northern Ireland substantially more than the rest, but then Ireland had a substantially larger housing bubble than the UK. Just because house prices may have been over priced in 06 and 07 does NOT imply that they must revert to 02 levels in order to be sustainable, and it has been common in the past for surges in house prices to turn into a levelling off rather than massive deflation. The only way to effectively show if prices are really inflated is to show if they deviate from what fundamentals imply true prices should be; which means you need to work out a 'fundamental cost' from many factors, including building costs, population growth, interest rates etc... It's no easy task, a simple graph doesn't cut it.

As for banks, they don't just release reserves into the public.

Reserve requirements are an aspect on the liability side to ensure withdrawals are met, some countries don't even have reserve requirements. What I'm saying is that excess reserves don't suddenly make it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements in the future, since they can almost certainly get funds from overnight market or central bank to meet the requirements should they need to. Fundamentally, banks lend if they think there are credit worthy customers, they almost never have to worry about a lack of funds, if there are customers they will lend to them; in fact some even argue that they create their own funds to do this.

As for the Shock Doctrine.  You mentioned it not I.  I've never read it, nor am I a particular fan of Naomi Klein.  There are several sources of Friedman's, Hayek's and von Mises' fascination/love affair with and services to fascism, not least their own writings.  Sure, they only viewed it as ""emergency capitalism"" to keep out and keep down the reds (with machine guns if necessary), but they were all fans of it when needed, despite their supposedly liberal/libertarian ideals: 

""It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history"" (that's von Mises - Ludwig, not Boris).

Ok then so the media hype was not necessary to raise awareness and increase the chances of finding Megan? Given that her being found is being attributed to an increase in the French media reporting the story?
As for perspective, I live locally to the school involved, I have a better perspective than many on here.  

Also, there are dozens of stories, both in the mainstream media and outside about events that affect billions, yet you don't post them up. Why is that then? 

Photos of Kate's baps was a non-story, that affected just 2 people, yet millions of people googled for the photos and commented on it on here. Media loved it because it sold the story, that is voyeurism and gossip. Quite different from a missing teenage girl.

Phillip Lahm

I guess the larger point here is that I feel Mata has the potential to become a transcendent player for Chelsea, a lot like Zola was.

true,Azradesh,null,null,"False. You need to be in a position of trust *over* the 16/17 year old with whom you are having sexing relations for it to be illegal.

&gt; The abuse of a position of trust is a criminal offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The act says that a person over the age of 18 who is in a position of trust over a person under the age of 18 commits a criminal offence if they involve the younger person in sexual activity. The offence first appeared in in sections 16-24 of the Sexual Offences (Amendments) Act 2000, which lists the following occupations to which the law applies:

&gt; *    Institutions looking after young people who are detained under a court order or enactment, such as a young offenders institution.
&gt; *    Accommodation provided by local authorities and voluntary organisations under statutory provision.
&gt; *    Hospitals, independent clinics, care homes, residential care homes, private hospitals, community homes, voluntary homes, children's homes and residential family centres.
&gt; *    Educational institutions.

&gt; The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced additional occupations to which the position of trust laws apply. These cover people who look after young people under 18 in the following ways:

&gt; *    Looking after them on an individual basis by providing services under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. This includes Connexions personal advisers.
&gt; *    Regularly having unsupervised contact with them as part of local authority provision of accommodation to young people who are in need, under police protection or detention, or on remand.
&gt; *    Having regular, unsupervised contact with them as someone who regularly reports to a court on matters of their welfare.
&gt; *    Looking after them on an individual basis as a personal adviser appointed under relevant legislation, such as when young people leave local authority care.
&gt; *    Looking after them in an official capacity on a regular basis when they are subject to a care order, supervision order or education supervision order.
&gt; *    Acting as their guardian as set out in the Children Act 1989, the Adoption Rules 1984 and the Family Proceedings Rule 1991.
&gt; *    Looking after them on an individual basis after their release from detention or in pursuance of a court order. This includes youth offending teams and treatment providers.

&gt; The act’s provisions mean that, subject to a number of limited definitions, it is a criminal offence for a person in a position of trust to engage in any sexual activity with a person aged under 18 with whom they have a relationship of trust, irrespective of the age of consent, even if the basis for their relationship is consensual. A relationship of trust exists where a member of staff or volunteer is in a position of power or influence over a pupil or student by virtue of the work or nature of the activity being undertaken. Sexual activity is given a broad definition that includes:

&gt; *    sexual activity including sexual touching through to vaginal or anal intercourse
&gt; *    causing or inciting sexual activity with a child
&gt; *    sexual activity in the presence of a child
&gt; *    causing a child to watch a sexual act.

Edit: [Here's](http://www.teachingexpertise.com/articles/sexual-relations-pupils-over-16-5634) a full summary of the sections in question and [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/abuse-of-position-of-trust) is the full act at the relevant section.

Edit 2: [Here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/21) is how the act defines positions of trust. It's very clear.

Part 5 is for you as a teacher.

&gt; This subsection applies if A looks after persons under 18 who are receiving education at an educational institution and B is receiving, and A is not receiving, education at that institution.

For example, if there are three 16 year olds, one is in your school, one has left education and one has moved on to 6th Form. Only with the 1st 16 year old is it illegal to have consensual sexual relations with and only whilst they are at your school.

Think of it like the Cybermen. They originally developed on Mondas, but in a parallel timeline they developed on Earth via Cybus Industries. Totally separate origins, yet the exact same result. They could do the same thing with the Valeyard. I think the Valeyard could be said to be not one specific entity, but simply the result of the Doctor gone bad.

Consider these two references to the Valeyard from older stories, and how they relate to the Doctor's recent behavioral changes:

&gt; From “Business Unusual”: While Lines searches for an expert, the Doctor sets off to explore the city of Brighton -- only to spot his future companion Melanie Bush walking down the street with a friend. He has been trying to avoid meeting her, knowing that if she joins him on his travels he will have taken one step further towards his destiny as the Valeyard.

Ok, so bringing someone on your travels who is from your personal future is apparently asking for trouble. Does that even begin to describe what he's doing with River? One mistake could change River's future thus changing the Doctor's past, so he's playing with fire in a big way.

&gt; From “Millennial Rites”: The Doctor asks Mel not to get involved, but his own curiosity has been piqued, and he secretly allows her to leave the TARDIS that night, knowing that she thinks she’s slipping away without his knowledge. He soon realizes, however, that by manipulating Mel into placing herself in possible danger for his own reasons, he’s taken the first steps on the path which will lead him to become the Valeyard.

The whole ""Doctor never fights, but lets others fight his battles for him"" theme has been very central to the last few seasons. It almost seems *too* obvious to me that this is what they're setting him up for, whether they realize it or not, and whether they call this potential future ""bad"" Doctor the Valeyard or something else.",0,1348859126,null,0,false,0,c6esm42,t3_10md09,t1_c6esm42,t3_10md09,null,1430014910,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

[2012] All ER (D) 143 (Sep), R v Evans:

Elias LJ, Coulson and Thirlwall JJ (judgment delivered extempore)

&gt; The defendant had been a swimming coach for a swimming club to which the complainants, Z and S, had attended. The defendant had never been a personal coach of the complainants. At the relevant time, Z had been 14 years' old and S had been 13 years' old. The defendant sent messages of a sexual nature to the complainants from his Blackberry mobile phone. He had sent the messages to all his contacts on his mobile, including members of his family. The complainants had received messages of a sexual nature from the defendant on more than one occasion. Following a contested trial, the defendant was convicted with two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity contrary to s 10(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. At sentencing, the judge remarked that the defendant had breached trust being one of the coaches of the swimming club and that there was a significant age difference between the defendant and the complainants. The defendant, who had no previous convictions, was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. The defendant appealed against the sentence. 

&gt;In the instant case, the sentence was manifestly excessive. The sentencing guidelines for the offence had four different categories but they had not been of help. Category three of the guidelines had been the closest. However, there had not been contact between the defendant and the complainants and so the offence would fall below category three. There had been a significant breach of trust but there had also been mitigating factors. There was an absence of previous convictions, an absence of specific targeting, and the defendant had sent the messages to all his contacts. Nevertheless, the defendant had been exceedingly misguided in the use of his Blackberry mobile phone. Accordingly, with the offence being less serious than category three in the sentencing guidelines, the correct starting point had been one of a 9-month sentence. There had been no credit for a guilty plea in the case and the appropriate sentence would be one of nine months' imprisonment. Given the unusual circumstances of the case, it was a case that the correct sentence would not involve immediate custody.

The fact that the complainants had received messages of a sexual nature from Evans on more than one occasion is probably the aggravating factor.",0,1348859465,null,0,false,0,c6espes,t3_10m4p3,t1_c6espes,t1_c6eqkvk,null,1430014952,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

It may be a non-story to those who are not bothered, or unaffected by it, but plastering it over the media raised awareness, the police use that tactic a lot to help find people.

Indeed it was an interesting story, there are dozens if not hundreds of similarly interesting stories out there that the media don't run with because they know it wont sell papers.

No, you have a different perspective. I fail to see how you can attribute it as better or worse.

&gt;yet you don't post them up. Why is that then?

As I said elsewhere, hyperbolic. You're trying to turn this into a black and white thing again: As I'm complaining I must be the total solution or my comments are invalid. Nope. Things aren't that simple.

&gt;Photos of Kate's baps was a non-story, that affected just 2 people.

Indeed, yet you assume I cared about that? I also complained about that garbage. Couldn't give a monkey's about that particular item of ""news"".

&gt;Ok then so the media hype was not necessary to raise awareness and increase the chances of finding Megan? Given that her being found is being attributed to an increase in the French media reporting the story? As for perspective, I live locally to the school involved, I have a better perspective than many on here.

As if she was going to stay missing forever. It's not like she was taken from her bedroom against her will. Teenagers make dumb decisions, I managed to burn off my friend's eyebrows when lighting a fire with too much petrol. All's well that ends well though!

Because if ONE person says something, then he is merely representing the thinking of the great hivemind, there is NO WAY that what he says isn't necessarily representative of a gigantic and diverse group of people who have strong disagreements with each other (you cite for instance Hayek &amp; Mises along with Friedman, but they despised each other, had completely different understandings of the economy and Mises even regarded Friedman as a socialist).

I could so easily cite so many anti-capitalists saying and supporting despicable and tyrannical things, and there is a long history of such (and it's even easy to argue a far left wing rationale for such, many Marxist-Lennists argued for instance that 'world socialism' was necessary for its system to work and be sustainable, and that military intervention was justified in that apparently the regimes they were intervening in were going to be subject to revolution by its own people eventually). For goodness sake, I even read heartfelt defences of mass murdering maniacs Pol-Pot and mao on counterpoint recently, it made me feel sick. But this doesn't lead me to conclude that anti-capitalists all think this way, and I cannot logically infer that anti-capitalist thinking must systemically lead to this kind of thought even if some deny it, which you seem to for capitalism, based on what some people say.

Incidentally, I'm no fan of Friedman but I'd like to see writings of Friedman explicitly supporting or requiring fascism (hint: not some courteous diplomatic reply letter sent to the Pinochet in response to request for advice over inflation, which he also did for communist China; I mean actual writings laying out his economic ideology and what it does or does not require).

From what I've read the only reason she was ""missing"" was because she wanted to be. Perhaps that's not the case but if the case had been darker I would have had a morbid curiosity about it, but unless I'm mistaken it's not. Yay, teenagers making poor decisions.

I'm not a Marxist-Lenninist so you can say what you like about 'em!  But, okay, seriously, you're right.  Lots of crap people in the world espousing all sorts of ideologies.  And crap person A espousing ideology B doesn't invalid the ideology.  Incidentally, [Mao has had a defence of sorts put forward](http://monthlyreview.org/commentary/did-mao-really-kill-millions-in-the-great-leap-forward).  How good it is, I'm not well-versed enough to know (not my field at all since all that Statist stuff gives me the heebie jeebies), but there's definitely a quantum of propaganda in the stereotypical view we have of him (both the West and the East were gunning for his reputation for their own ends once he was dead).  Pol Pot of course, was supported in various ways by the same economics/politics crowd as Pinochet (Reagan, Thatcher and their advisors - including Friedman).  Churchill wasn't a clean handsed saintlike hero any more than Hitler was an unrelenting murderous psychopath with no redeeming features.

Edit: I've had a good look for something by Friedman specifically, and - assuming you've read the letters written by him and Pinochet, the reports about the activities of his agent in Chile (Harberger) and the policies implemented under their direction by those he trained at the Chicago School; as well as the open letters written by Andre Frank - [1](http://www.scribd.com/doc/35193736/Frank-AG-Economic-Genocide-in-Chile-Open-Letter-to-Milton-Friedman-and-Arnold-Harberger) and [2](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCMQFjABOAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rrojasdatabank.info%2Fgenoc2.pdf&amp;ei=ahhmUIKlHuHQmAW0-IHQCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZsO3t7-VSnRYrErNSPzTgBOKLaQ), then I doubt I'm going to convince you tonight as I don't have time to trawl all his books and articles for pro-fascist statements.  I think the idea that he was sufficiently naive or uncaring to provide them with a brutal economic programme which resulted (and he must've known would result) in many thousands of deaths is sufficient to establish complicity.

&gt;I like to think at heart I'm a nice guy, but I can also be cold and callous. You may well be a good parent, but you can be pretty hyperbolic from what I've seen on here. There's worse character flaws though - you could misuse ""your"" for example!

I suspect I have misused 'your' in the past.... I plan to go to a therapy group to ensure I do not slip down that road again. 

&gt;Also I may have misread your last message (my apologies if so, I'm not meaning to patronise you) - knee-jerk as in reacting swiftly and without necessarily thinking things through fully. To me it seems you care a lot about this but that's clouding the more rational side of your personality, imbuing this with a lot more importance than the rest of us think it deserves.

With you now, it is more intolerance to reddit users who like to be shitty for the sake of it, there are quite a few of them on here and they add little or nothing to a conversation. I would use the word 'troll' to describe them but it is overused IMO. As for caring, of course I care, I am genuinely pleased she is home, whether that is from a 'I am a mother' view or because I feel empathy I couldn't tell you. However I wouldn't expect everyone else to be that worried about it, other than a general sense of being glad she is home perhaps. Perhaps I am old fashioned in that I consider posting up that 'Megan is hot' or 'He wanted to fuck teen' or 'Good now I don't have to put up with it in the media' is just disrespectful and a bit nasty.  Actually reading back on that I guess I really am old fashioned and deluded to think that matters to anyone these days. I will get my cardy...

I do things to change things quite often, I'm quite well known for it amongst the folks I know! However this is a cause I don't consider important enough to put many resources into. By posting a comment at least others will see and may be spurred into action, feeling that there is a groundswell of support.

Oh man if you ever get anything to change on here I will donate all my upvotes ever to you! I gave up pretty quickly on here, instead I concentrate on other social media sites to try and get people interested in things outside the mainstream media. It works occasionally too....until a new series of Britain's got talent comes on..... *sigh* 

&gt;The empathy thing comes into play here - I have no stake in her fate regardless. I'd rather not hear anything about it. Given I've never met her and probably never will he life, or death, don't really affect me (with the exception of this conversation, obviously).

Look upon it objectively, for a variety of reasons, Megan needed to be found, I think the main one being that her teacher had driven to France with her without any real plans of how he could support the pair of them, or ensure they had the basics. But aside from the reasons to find her, the best way of finding her was to create as much awareness as possible, to reach as many people as possible. You can't phone up everyone in France and ask them, so practicality dictates the media is the best way. It might well get on peoples tits, just like other news stories do, but it is still the most effective way.

true,bobbyb500,tardis,TARDIS,"My feelings on RTD vs Moffat are that while RTD can craft a great scene, Moffat is better at creating a overall good story. 

RTD has good scenes: Rose's departure and subsequent farewell scene at Bad Wolf Bay; Dr. Yana discovering his true identity while elsewhere at the same time the Doctor comes to the same conclusion; the Doctor reuniting with Rose, getting shot, and nearly regenerating; Donna's triumph against Davros and the Daleks while the full effects of the metacrisis are revealed; Donna's downfall and farewell as the full effects of the metacrisis are revelaed; and of course 10's final scene. The episodes in which these scenes appear are great episodes because of these scenes. This is why I believe *Midnight* is the best episode written by Davies; it is one long scene.

Moffat, meanwhile has crafted better stories: ""The Girl in the Fireplace"", ""Blink"", ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""The Big Bang"", ""A Good Man Goes to War"", ""Let's Kill Hitler"", and my personal pick as the best story of the new show, ""Silence in the Library""/""Forest of the Dead"". These are all great episodes because of the stories told in each. Each might have memorable scenes, but no great scenes in a Moffat episode are all that meaningful without the surrounding story.

Pick any given great scene written by Davies and put it up against any given great scene written by Moffat, I think RTD will usually be the winner. But do the same with any given story, I'll give it to Moffat.

-------------------

Bang on right! The youth team when I was there (not like today with DR in charge) virtually no one made it from the youth team to the first team any more, this led to a lot of guys leaving to find other clubs where they might have a better chance of getting through.. but they always used them 2 guys to show us what we can achieve if we worked hard and listened. 

Gerrard is a nice friendly guy but he's awkward as fuck to talk to and just keeps to himself and the people he knows, Jamie is fearless and doesnt give a fuck, he'll talk to everyone and tell you how it is.

Off the pitch their nice people, Jamie is particularly cool to talk to once you learn scouse, but they are not the same people on the pitch...Gerrard becomes a brick wall of emotion and Jamie the steel supports

Stevie really has a never say die attitude, when he trains he used to increase the intensity at the end rather than make it easier and he always pushed himself, not no 75% but 95-110% everytime to get better, its almost ridiculous.

Jamie on the other hand trained just as hard but is more of a thinker, he takes on a managerial view of the game from the back while playing and uses it to make live adjustments that the manager cant see.",0,1348863592,null,0,false,0,c6ettzt,t3_10mqwe,t1_c6ettzt,t1_c6etlmm,null,1430015485,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

true,NotMud,null,null,"The ""highly shifty"" photo of the burglar is from North News, a picture agency based in, well, the North. The Beeb can't afford (or chooses not to afford) to send a photographer up there, so relies on somebody else's image. As it happens, the image they used is [pretty much the only one out there](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Richard+Rochford) so I don't think it was a deliberate act of editorial injustice!

But it's probably true, the quality of the BBC will have deteriorated in line with its economic situation. As with all news outlets, they're feeling the pinch and as a result some aspects of their operation will be running less smoothly than they could be. There are typos abound, presumably because they're spending less on subbing, and as discussed above they're reliant on other people's images rather than their own for stories outside London.

The Beeb has no adverts and doesn't sell directly, so it has little interest in sensationalising news stories like this. I think the changes you're spotting are symptoms of the Economic Downturn rather than nefarious tabloidesque shenanigans.

Edit: It seems like it was a choice between that photo and [this photo](http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01578/SNN0609BB-_1578984a.jpg). I know which one I prefer.",0,1348864543,null,0,false,0,c6eu3e8,t3_10mnkj,t1_c6eu3e8,t3_10mnkj,null,1430015614,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

That's Spurs for me.

American (no surprise)...

* I loved Peter Crouch, he was a nut. He went to Spurs.

* I loved Wilson Palacios, one of my favorite Honduran players. He went to Spurs.

* And Luka Modric.

* And Roman Pavlyuchenko.

* I liked Martin Jol

* I even like Juande Ramos

* And, I was obsessed with Harry Redknapp

Every time I turned around, this f'n team kept on popping up on my radar.

So, move the clock to August 2008. My son was born in late July, and was a nightmare baby. Furiously colicky, he screamed inconsolably for about 11 hours a day. My wife and I took turns being miserable tending to him. Walking with him. Holding him in our arms. Walking with him. Trying to calm him down. It worked ~20% of the time. That was enough.

I got the night shift, and ended up trying to put an inconsolable kid back to sleep from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM, every single night for *months*.

So, I turned the TV on mute, and watched replays of Premier League matches.

For some reason or another, this forlorn Tottenham team (2 points in 8 matches).... just *made sense* to me at the time. I 'got them'. My nightly struggles with this kid just seemed to go right along with their weekly struggles at the Lane.  It was therapeutic. Watching Spurs lose, over and over again, while I paced back and forth with my unhappy little kid.

I can't remember what match it was, but I decided to turn the TV volume on, just a little bit, and I heard: ""*OH WHEN THE SPUUUUURS*""

""Did they just say that?""

""*OH WHEN THE SPUUUUURS*""

""Oh, shit""

""*OH WHEN THE SPUUUURS GO MARCHING IN*""

I'm from Louisiana. My family's been here since the 1780s. The song: ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" is practically our National Anthem.

That was it. I was hooked. No looking back. 2 points in 8 games or stomping Milan at the San Siro.

Come On You Spurs!

&gt;
&gt;.

No, I'm sorry, but you are mistaken.  Those you name are 100% high definition releases.

* The Christmas animated shows were [shot on 35mm film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066327/technical), which natively has a base resolution higher than 1080p is.  So, like classic films (such as Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, The Searchers, It's a Wonderful Life) and like other old TV shows which were shot on 35mm film (like Star Trek: TOS, The Prisoner, Space: 1999, The Twlight Zone and the upcoming release of The Dick Van Dyke Show), these can all be released on Blu-ray Disc in native 1080p simply by transfering the (cleaned-up and remastered) 35mm film version to digital 1080p HD masters.

* In the case of Star Trek: TNG, the prinicipal photography was all done on 35mm film, but the show was FINISHED on SD videotape by adding in the special effects (""SFX"") on top of the filmed scenes...all done on videotape.  Those SFX are in standrd def (SD) only.  So what CBS/Paramount is going back and doing (already done with S1, finishing up with S2 now and plans to finish all 7 seasons) is to go back to the original notes about SFX shots for each scene in each episode, and re-do them with modern digital SFX in 1080p HD quality, then layer those back in on top of the original (and cleaned-up, remastered) 35mm filmed scenes.  Thus resulting in a native 1080p high-def result that can be broadcast in syndication on HD channels, or sold on Blu-ray Disc,  or both to maximize a return on the (huge!) investment in performing this upgrade task.  If this works out, then CBS/Paramount MAY go back and do the same with other shows that were ""finished"" on videotape, like ST:DS9 and ST:Voy (ST:Ent could be released on Blu tomorrow, as could ST:TAS, but there's not enough interest in those at this time so the studio isn't biting).  Other ""finsihed on videotape"" shows that would need high-def upgrades include The X-Files and Babylon 5 (upgrade costs would be HUGE on that one because of SO many SFX produced in SD...Warner probably wouldn't recoup the investment, frankly).

* Another obstacle to Blu-ray releases of certain TV shows is best represented by Buffy the Vampire Slayer, MASH and Burn Notice: shows that were shot on 16mm film to save on the budget (as early seasons of each of these programs were).  You can put them out on Blu-ray if you want to...Burn Notice S2 was.  But it was a lackluster-looking release, because the resolution isn't fully there, plus the colors aren't as vibrant.  And the gamma correction seems to always be off (scenes tend to be either too bright or too dark).  You can do it, but it's not a good fit.

* But the worst fit of all is upconverting SD to HD.  Look at the releases on Blu-ray of Highlander: The Series; people were MAD about those.  Imagine how awful something like All In The Family might look on Blu-ray if you tried to upconvert it.  Shows that were natively shot on 35mm - like the upcoming Blu-ray release of Friends and the already-begun Looney Tunes cartoons - are a natural for release as more and more people adapt Blu-ray. Eventually we'll see other hugely popular shows on BD (I'd be shocked if we didn't see shot-on-35mm shows like Seinfeld, I Love Lucy, The West Wing, and The Brady Bunch show up on HD format eventually)  But the Blu prospects for natively-SD shows - like Doctor Who, or He-Man cartoons, or older Power Rangers - are pretty bleak.  Fox is taking a shot at it, though, by upconverting Simpsons Season 15 and releasing it this December on both DVD and Blu-ray (note that the show didn't start produced episodes in HD until Season 20).  I'm unsure what the consumer reaction will be to Simpsons S15 on BD.  I know that I am not paying extra for the BD version of it!  I suspect most people who get the Blu version will feel underwhelmed, just like people (myself included) who paid for the Blu-ray version of Burn Notice S2.

So basically you would remove all personal interest stories, and report news only by the number of people affected? I assume you have some kind of minimum threshold number that an event must impact x-million people before it can ever be allowed to be printed on a front page, because after all it's impossible for a person to be cognizant of more than one story at a time? I guess then that between 2004 and 2012 every front page story must be about the Iraq War, perhaps we can hold for a year or two around 2008  when we report only the recession, but then we must return promptly to printing gory pictures of war since that's normally the most important event.

It is now alleged that specific instructions were issued from the “highest level of government” to ensure that the BBC’s camera crews focused on the miners’ violence and not on “the police smashing heads”.  The allegation has been made by the former Daily Mirror industrial editor Geoffrey Goodman, chairman of the editorial board of British Journalism Review, who insisted he has an “impeccable source”.  But in a speech on the Untold History of the Miners’ Strike, former BBC industrial correspondent Nicholas Jones said he did not believe that such instruction was issued. However, he acknowledged that towards the end of the year long strike the balance of coverage tipped firmly in favour of Margaret Thatcher and the National Coal Board.

* Raising the repayment level to £21K from £15K hurts students from poorer areas as it reduces the number of places and thus increases the qualifications necessary and students in poorer areas tend to perform to a lower standard at A level.

* Demand outstrips supply with places meaning that universities are less competitive over quality of teaching.

* Fees charged aren't linked to services provided and supply/demand means that universities aren't competing on price.

* Government overestimated graduate wages which increases the cost to the public purse.

* Increase in money to universities and loan payments could have an inflationary effect.

yes and no. Its like any club or sport you do ANYWHERE, they may be your team mates, you might get on with some well others really well, but you only really want to see them when your at the club and thats where you like the relationship to stay.

A few guys were special and you can hang around them all day, all night but the others your with them most of the day so it becomes boring because nothing interesting or new happens and all the conversation is about football 24/7 so you go looking for friends outside of the football.

true,Anzereke,null,null,"&gt;No, you own stuff and people generally agree with and adhere to this concept. There's a difference.

What difference? You just reworded that. The point either way is that property is not an inate aspect of the universe.

&gt;No, the courts enforce laws designed to protect ownership via the police. Not sure where 'a government' comes into it in this instance.

...I'm not sure how to explain that courts and police fall under the government umbrella without sounding too patronising even for my tastes.
I will point out that a government is needed before either of those things can come into existence as they are generally defined.

&gt;And there's nothing inate that gives you the right to take what you like.

Yes there is. **Need**.

A homeless person needs a house, there is a house, that's about as close to inate as you're ever going to get.

&gt;No, you don't - this happens whether you agree or not, and it's not 'simply' unless you have your own agenda to push. And (again) it happens via courts, not the government. And fines are 'violent' now?

First, varying degrees of violence was the term. Any imposition upon another by force is technically violent, and this does indeed vary up to the point of armed response in order to forcefully evict in extreme cases. Same for all property.

Second, you're overlaying the claim of an agenda and acting like that is a counter point in itself. Sure I have an agenda, but unless you have an actual argument against the point I'm not seeing what that has to do with anything.

Third, governments set laws, courts enforce laws, police enforce at a lower level. All of these are public sector, government employees. I'm not sure how you can even claim otherwise.

&gt;Nope, you give them money anyway, for many different reasons. Unless you're trying to overlay your own agenda.

Taxes are paid to obtain a number of services and live on government owned land (ie in a country) and again you use that agenda claim to dismiss something you don't have an actual counter point to.

&gt;Really? At this point it becomes agenda-stealing drivel.

Ad Hominem. Unsurprsiing given your only other option was to claim that you don't do what the government tells you to.

&gt;Any human construct is entirely artificial. Doesn't make it optional.

By definition it does exactly that. 

If it is artificial then we can choose to keep it or not and thus must examine it based on objective merits and flaws given our current scenarios and future projections. If it is natural then we can only accept it and try to shape things around it. 

&gt;How many societies don't have ownership or pay taxes?

I'm not here to teach you anthropology.

&gt;You mean instead of attempting to justify theft by trying to ridicule/ dismiss the entire premise of law, ownership and taxes by using convenience-logic, reductionism and such? Laughable.

Theft is a loaded term, also an inaccurate one since if property is abolished then you cannot steal something anyway.

And I didn't dismiss anything (I'm not saying I wouldn't like to go further, but that's a much larger discussion) in that post other than the claim that property is inate. You're the one who turned this into a strawman argument against sweeping terms and ideas, you inserted these issues into your viewpoint.

The show has kept it around as we dove into larger arcs (The cracks, the Silence, River), but since Moffat took over we haven't had a season that just stuck to stand alone episodes for the beginning part of the season. However, this is how every season started in RTD's run, and it was still pretty entertaining.

Again, I just think we've gotten used to Moffat's format of introducing a big arc and then working around it. Instead this season seems to be heavily focused on character development, specifically for The Doctor as he says goodbye to 2 companions and moves on to a new one.

When you're a teacher in charge of a bunch of young girls who all give you loads of attention (because effectively you're the alpha male in the group for some) then I imagine it must be hard to resist advances from them. I'm sure after a while it starts to feel normal to have 14/15 year old girls throw themselves at you while they work out who they are and their lives and I'm sure it must be difficult for the teachers to work out how to react.

Several of my friends – gay and straight, male and female – had sex with adults from the ages of nine to 13. None feel they were abused. All say it was their conscious choice and gave them great joy.  
  
This is a highly spurious argument.  The fact that these people don't think they were abused does not mean that they were not abused.  In particular, a **9 year-old** can't possibly have developed the intellectual and emotional maturity to give meaningful and informed consent to sex.  That person was raped.  The adult who had sex with them is a rapist.  That's about as abusive as you can get.  
  
With regard to Jeremy Forrest and Megan Stammer, a 15 year-old simply doesn't have the life experience necessary to enter in anything approaching an equal relationship with a 30 year-old, particularly one that has specific authority over her.  Even if she went willingly (which it appears she did), any reasonable person would suspect Forrest of having unduly influenced her thinking on the matter.

It is simply wrong that in the 21st century women are repeatedly raped and treated as sex slaves with the connivance of their parents. All decent people are against forced marriage, and if anyone disapproves an information campaign in schools to suppress it, then they should be told in no uncertain terms that they are barbaric subhuman vermin and if they don't like British values they should fuck off.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"What you just called ""the truly clueless customer"" is what the entire industry refers to as the ""mass market""...and without those numbers of people behind your product, then the product fails. Take what you said about BD sales going up 20%, while DVD sales dropped 20%.  It's quarts vs. gallons.  The 20% dip in DVD sales mentioned in that write-up was 1.7 billion...an amount almost equal to the ENTIRE Blu-ray industry at the time (2 billion).

What many people also fail to realize is that for the studios, the cost to them is greater for BD than for DVD.  To put the exact identical content onto BD, it can cost as much as 6 times more than to put it on DVD.  So studios aren't in a hurry to put out BDs unless they feel it's a sure-fire hit.  A good example of that is in the TV-on-BD world, where some shows were tried on Blu-ray, did very poorly, and the follow-up seasons did not return to Blu, just DVD.  Some shows I can name off the top of my head include the previously mentioned Burn Notice, as well as How I Met Your Mother, Damages, Nip/Tuck, Scrubs, Rescue Me, and The Sopranos.

Full Disclosure department: I'm the ""news guy"" at the TVGuide.com-owned website, TVShowsOnDVD.com (we're ranked either 2nd or 3rd - depending on whose chart you use - in most-used DVD News Site category, we are about to celebrate our 11th anniversary since the site debuted, and I've been there since beta testing; it's just me and the site founder/webmaster...we're the entire staff).  I regularly talk to people in the industry: at the studios, in retail (store level and owner/HQ level), producers who produced the shows, writers who wrote for the shows, and all the associated industries like box art designers, menu creators, close captioners, whatever.  I get a lot of inside info about what they're all looking for, and while I'm not saying you're wrong, Mr. Bookchaser, what I am doing is telling you in all these posts what the industry folks routinely tell me.  If you think the industry should be different, then don't tell me.  Tell them.  They'll listen to your input, provided directly any way you can (say, on the company's Facebook page or Twitter feed), more quickly then they'll listen to me.  They've heard me for years now; they kinda KNOW what I'll say.  :)

EDIT: by the way, a lot of the ""unloading"" you see of DVDs has to do with people who either are cleaning up their collections and getting rid of the titles they realize they don't watch so much (if ever), or people getting rid of stuff previously owned by someone no longer in the picture (someone they broke up with, or is deceased, or went off to college, etc.), or even people who think ""I don't need this; I've got NetFlix"" (whoops; hope they don't get rid of a beloved film on DVD and later realize that NetFlix don't keep every single title indefinately!).  As with other recent formats, Blu-ray is slow to be found at garage sales, thrift stores, flea markets, pawn shops and the like.  But even if you're not seeing BDs there so far, I am.  In small amounts, sure, because it's still a new format.  But it will ramp up as time goes on, and for the same reasons.  Yes, some of those old DVDs being gotten rid of as used would be because the person replaced it with a BD version.  But that's really just a small part of the puzzel.  I know, because I go to those venues as well (for movies, for videogames systems going all the way back to Atari/Intellivision/Coleco/Odyssey, and for books and CDs as well).",0,1348875865,null,0,1348876496,0,c6ewt2l,t3_10m3hk,t1_c6ewt2l,t1_c6ewikt,null,1430016962,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Asylum should have been amazing. I wanted to see some crazy Daleks doing crazy things and instead we get Amy being unwilling to talk through her problems and a pseudo-intro to the new companion.

Dinosaurs was just campy, which I like once in a while, but knowing Amy and Rory only had 5 episodes, I would have preferred it held off.

Mercy wasn't that good for me. I don't like westerns in general and I prefer aliens that look... ""alien"", not a new race of Mike Tysons. I ""get"" the whole parallel between The Doctor and the other guy, I just didn't like the execution. 

Power of Three was cool until the bad guy reveal and solution. Hey it's a new race that's apparently like Time Lord boogeymen that could have been cool but he was around for 30 seconds and then The Doctor just waves his screwdriver around and... problem solved.

Attempting to squat occupied residential property is already a criminal offense. If that ever happened to you, you would be classed as a “Displaced Residential Occupier” and entitled to police assistance to seek immediate reposession of your home, as stated in the Criminal Law Act 1977. Bear in mind that since this law was introduced, there has never been a recorded case of police acting on behalf of a Displaced Residential Occupier.

Most of the time, property owners of empty residences are classed as Protected Intended Occupiers and can go to court to obtain an 'Interim Possession Order' (IPO) against alleged squatters, which takes no more than a couple of hours if you have the necessary paperwork. Once an order is granted, the squatter has 24 hours after receiving the IPO to vacate the property. Refusal to comply is a criminal offence under section 76 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.

Also, trespassing on private property has never been considered a criminal offense in English law, except in a small number of cases (such as failure to comply with an IPO).",0,1348878984,null,0,false,0,c6exh0l,t3_10lvq1,t1_c6exh0l,t1_c6enz7d,null,1430017282,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The best part is that I applied for it, it's just the time to apply had ran out, they gave me no time limit on the application either.

When they decided to send it all to a decision maker they give you what I like to call ""a pointless plea"" where you can present evidence via mail to assist your innoscence, I sent all my prints along with a letter that said something on the lines of:

&gt;""Please take into account the 9 applications dated and sent that accompany this letter, granted I failed to apply for the job within the time limit that I wasn't informed about I felt that a the volume of my applications was adequate enough to comply with the job centers contract on looking for work.""*

3 days later i'm sanctioned for 6 months, so I decided to cheat them. They cheated me so I cheated them.

I told them my mother was a cripple and applied for a hardship allowance to aid her in day to day, I presented them with enough evidence to believe me and I got it within the hour. The messed up bit is that only entitled me to £32 a week.

That's for food, travel, bills, ink for my printer and new shoes to wear to interviews and i'm not one of these folks who thinks that they NEED brand name stuff, my shoes were £10 from Asda and thats because my original shoes were worn through from walking.

In the end I hate to say it but lying and cheating the system is sometimes the only way to get by. The Job Centre makes the rules and changes them whenever they like.

Don't get me wrong cheating the system is a wrong thing but what is worse is cutting off a persons only source of income and still expecting them to travel to signings, interviews with employers, handing out CVs, printing said CVs and basically hindering you in your process of finding employment.

John Terry was the archetypal captain in the back 4, but I don't think we'll see that after he does step down. Luiz and Ivanovic I see as too headstrong and prone to losing their cool, while Cahill and Cole seem to let their actions do the talking. I don't think it will be someone from the back 4 next.

Females weren't happy with being restricted to service roles so why would males be content with them? Apathy at lack of opportunity will in itself drive unwillingness to work in these roles and increase unemployment.

Best current example I can think of is what is happening in veterinarian courses. Projections are that these will reach something like 80-90 percent female in the next decade. Roll that on another decade or so and most of the active vets and teaching staff will also be women. This is the very extreme example of course, most degrees are not this slanted (and ratio in sciences is still tilted towards men I believe) but I'm using it for a reason.

The result of this large imbalance will be that a veterinary career is likely to become seen as a feminine career. There is no male equivalent of the female drive to break into male dominated careers. That can be seen by looking at male:female nursing recruitment where there are actually initiatives for greater male representation that aren't working at all because males taking up the profession are, unjustly, viewed as being less masculine for doing so. Over time, as the veterinary profession become more and more feminised it will become more and more incapable of attracting good male students. End result of that feedback loop will be a profession that has an extreme minority of male representation.

Unfortunately male advocacy at present is hovering around the same intellectual level as a monkey playing with its own faeces.

I had been told by the job centre that I could work up to 16 hours a week while staying on JSA and I would be paid the difference between my job earnings and the JSA amount. i.e. £30 a week on the job and about £14 from JSA. The job might have been 7 hours one week, 14 hours the next week, no hours the next week. After about 6 weeks on the job I was told by the Job Centre to pay back all of the £250 they had paid me. After a few more weeks of irregular hours earning £25-70 a week I decided it wasn't worth spending £4 in bus fares to get to the Job Centre each fortnight. I told them I wanted to come off JSA and they suddenly got very stern and said ""How will you survive unless you've been working more hours than you've been telling us about?"" Well, I would be £2/week better off for a start.

In all that time, the only help the Job Centre gave me was to print off a couple of job ads for completely irrelevant jobs over 30 miles away. I had plenty of people patronisingly telling me to take any job going, even if it was a shit job. I *was* looking for shit jobs. I was *working* in a shit job. But the few times I actually managed to get as far as a job interview I was competing with dozens of other applicants.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I ment it was tomorrow but as its 4:30am and im not going to sleep tonight fuck it might as well answer this..

&gt; First off, how involved were they in the day to day training and matches of the youth academy? 

RB would tell the group what type of training we was doing, we'd start with warming up, stretching, group drills, then we'd go off and train with our coaches then the coaches would report to RB and RB would report to PS and then PS would decide that the team we are playing are defensive so we need to play more attacking football so then RB would tell the coaches and the coaches would adjust your training so it was more attacking focused.

In simple terms PS was the thinker and the decision maker, RB made sure it was executed perfectly. Come game time they both would come but PS would take notes and adjust the team and formation and RB would control the team and the play. 

Everything was executed in sync between them 2. 

&gt;  How much did they try to teach players at the academy tactically, and how much training was based on improving technique?

With PS it was 90% technical training, drills, drills, drills..ball control made up what felt like the majority of the session, they did so many technical sessions that you would KILL just to get on the pitch and play a game, but no arguing it really improved everyone's game, fewer mistakes were made and everybody seemed a lot more confident and efficient. 

It was more mental than for development purposes because you became so confident that your technique is flawless and superior to the opposing player that it allowed you to focus on the wider aspects of the game. 

&gt;What sorts of non-field training did they use to help improve the squad? 

Theory training, they'd run through set plays and we would have an in depth discussion about them until everybody knew where they were, what they were doing and what to do incase of a change. Also team bonding sessions like letting us hang out and have friendly kick abouts.

&gt; They also reportedly got the club playing the same formation froms the youngest levels through to the seniors - did this mean youngsters were taught how to play specific roles on the pitch and moulded from what have been there more natural instincts? 

Kinda true the 17+ guys did but the younger teams didnt bother as they were still trying to build the foundation as professional players. Only certain players that stood out as being really talented or promising in a certain ability or position were encouraged to work on it. Early on though they didnt want to commit a player to a certain position to find out later they would be much better suited in another role.

&gt; Were players encouraged to pick up specific skills useful for certain positions (such as learning to be better two footed, learning proper crossing technique when out wide and also how to cut in from the flanks etc)?

If you needed to then you'd stay behind after main training and you'd work one on one with a coach, the REALLY young players are taught in groups to do so but the older players had to take it apon themselves unless they were specifically told to, for the most part though we were, I was told to learn how to adjust the height on my free kicks, these kind of sessions made the most impact on a players game.

&gt; How often was rafa involved in training and instruction of young players?

very rarely, we'd only see him if we took a trip to Melwood to watch the senior guys play, he did come down to watch us train once when it was RIDICULOUSLY hot, so of course everybody assumed he'd come down to bring one of us through the ranks so we all gave it 150% and almost all died of heat stroke and exhaustion..turns out he was just eating his lunch, a sandwich..it looked delicious 

&gt; When players were performing well for U18s and younger, what was the process by which they would be integrated into the reserves?

because of the very very VERY limited chances of making the first team via the academy reserve players wouldnt hang around for long so there was always spots opening up, they'd just say to you that you may be needed to play in the first team. 

The reserves when I was there and up to last year was a dead end at LFC.

&gt; Would players train with the first teams squad purely for training purposes even if there weren't in contention for selection?

Yes but only the Reserve players would, they'd normally take on the style of play of the 'opposing team' so the first team could get an idea of what it was going to be like, but other than that the first team wernt allowed to play outside of training hours incase they injured themselves or others (aka THEMSELVES). 

&gt; Did you know Gary Ablett at all during your time there?

I saw him around but he was the reserve team coach I believe? so I never spoke to him and he'd only come about looking for players to take over to melwood in the reserve team, Its a shame he died, seemed like a very nice guy.",0,1348890566,null,0,false,0,c6ezu9g,t3_10mqwe,t1_c6ezu9g,t1_c6eyu7t,null,1430018386,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

But what makes it more tragic is that she can't remember ***ANYTHING*** related to The Doctor, otherwise her brain would overheat and die. She wanted to continue being who she was, she didn't want to forget, but she had to or else die.

Seriously, it's depressing to ***us*** dammit! Sure, she got married and got money, but that was just The Doctor making up for what he had to do to save her. Even he was sad that all she did for herself and the universe had to be erased, forgotten forever. Heck, even Wilfred tells The Doctor that she was better with him than she is now.

She became more than some middle-aged office tempt, *she saved all of reality* and ***she doesn't even know it***.

All while Rose got a duplicate Doctor, her Dad back from an alternate-universe, and pretty much everything else she's ever wanted. I mean, she seemed fine with The Doctor she got, considering she was ***LITERALLY*** too busy making out with him to notice him ***leaving.*** /rant

Fuck, now I'm sad...

Edit:

Thanks, now I'm tearing up, I watched that scene again, while confirming whether or not Rose was too busying making out. Seriously, Donna was in tears ***BEGGING*** him not to make her forgot.

As for what have Arsenal done? Well, in 2010/2011 we beat them 2-0 at home before losing to them 3-1 away, and last season we lost to them 5-3 at home and then drew 0-0 away. Arsenal have scored 12 goals in their last 2 home games, and have only conceded 2 goals this season in the league. This is not an easy fixture and it shouldn't be treated as such.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"The BBC have a strong left wing bias . They propagandise . They manipulate and taint the information that they supply - they selectively supply information rather than providing it all as is .

They completely missed the global economic crash . They strongly supported AGW despite what the science and the economics said. They are very strongly environmentalist . It doesn't matter what program that they are producing , if they can , they put a strong socialist element into it . This includes kids programs which they strongly use for propaganda purposes ( which I think is absolutely appalling ) . 

The quality of journalism at the BBC is very poor . It lacks depth and breadth . It lacks a good overall understanding - perspective . A lot of the time they concentrate on their talking heads rather than the subject at hand . In other words it's very unprofessional - they are taking the piss - using and abusing the tax payers .

The BBC is hell bent on giving Murdoch their collective head on a plate . They are doing everything they can to discredit themselves , whether it's by taint , bias , propaganda or just plain low quality rubbish programs . The BBC are actually just the flip side of the Fox \ NI coin .

I'm one of the many people who used to support the BBC 100% . I grew up listening to the WS . I used to watch and listen to them in the UK . These days I can't stand them . I was absolutely disgusted at how they gamed the readers comments on their web site during the expenses scandal and was appalled at how they completely dropped any objectivity during the Copenhagen Climate Conference . Give them a science program and they turn it into a propaganda piece .

The BBC is so buried in it's own bubble that it can often have a very poor understanding of the world as a whole . It only sees bits and pieces of it . It then tries to piece it together into the model it has in it's mind - and we all know how unreliable models can be .

We are a large club but not as big as United to where we lose ourself in our stature. I personally am 19 and the only dream ive ever had in my life is to see the Reds win at Anfield. There is almost nothing that matters more to me. When we lose i shake with anger and disapointment and when we win i shake in happiness and anticipation for the next match. I pray for the day i can watch us win a League Championship or a UEFA Cup with my father before he passes. The players bleed passion and it makes supporting so much better. Our owners are dedicated. We dont buy attitude and our players are class. Stevie G is one of the most genuine and kind human beings as well as the best Captain in the world.

This includes kids programs which they strongly use for propaganda purposes ( which I think is absolutely appalling ) .

A lot of the time they concentrate on their talking heads rather than the subject at hand . In other words it's very unprofessional - they are taking the piss - using and abusing the tax payers .

2) If Amy and Rory were to raise Amy as her parents, there might be a problem with towns people noticing child Amy aging turns into exactly, not just nearly, Amy as a parent.

3) If for whatever reason they go back to raise Amy when she didn't have parents (if you can go to that timeline somehow), there was only 1 aunt, no uncle. Also, the aunt tried very hard to convince Amy that the raggedy man didn't exist.

Interestingly, the Anglican Church's order of service is perhaps closer to the Latin than the old translation in the Catholic Mass, they say ""And with your spirit"". I kind of like it. 

That being said, I think the Church has sacrificed comprehensibility and ease of use for a notional better translation. For example, the bit in the creed where we used to say ""of one being with the Father"" the Latin is ""consubstantialem Patri"", literally, ""consubstantial with the Father"". It is technically more accurate, but does it actually make a difference? One being and consubstantial mean basically the same thing. All its done is confuse people. Madness.

With Borini coming off an injury, I'd be tempted to leave him and Agger at home, give them more time to heal, and instead play Coates and then Pacheco or Downing, with Assaidi coming off the bench. Norwich is a good team but a good Liverpool performance, even by a team that is half strength, should be enough for a win. That said, I know we haven't won in the League yet so the best XI should be on the pitch. Also important to consider: Udinese is good opposition midweek.

With all that said and with Downing apparently not traveling, I'd start wisdom and Coates for Kelly and Agger, sahin for shelvey, and then Assaidi for Borini.

* Employers will be forced to contribute to pension schemes

* Everyone will be pushed to save for their retirement reducing the burden on those of us who already invest.

* Something to use as an argument with employers who already contribute as paying the legal minimum will no longer be seen as a perk so they'll have to out their percentage up.

**Disadvantages**

* Will encourage pension trusts to offer even less than they already do.

* Will cause some budgeting issues at the beginning for some people.

probably return.

I doubt if many of us spend a lot of time contemplating how capitalism was perceived 60+ years ago. 

It seems to me like the fall of the USSR has led to the narrative that ""capitalism won"" and is thus flawless^1 and beyond question.

The USSR was totally broken, but I think its existence permitted us to say ""look, there's another way of doing things"". I think that left the door open, in the 70s and 80s (and I guess before that?) to say ""well, that's not working, but maybe there's some middle ground"".

As things stand now it seems to me like our social-political-economic system has basically stood unchallenged for a decade or two, and it's treated like it's naturally and inherently right, and without need of the barest adjustment.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"I would argue that a ""pure capitalist"" system has been discredited, several times. Which is to say capitalism with little to no external regulation/over-sight (e.g. the current credit crisis as a result of the New York Vs. London deregulation wars).    

But pure capitalism still has a massive number of supporters, partly because people blame capitalism's failings on the little regulation that did exist, and partly because they're greedy and see regulation stepping in the way of their greed.    

My position is that capitalism works but needs to have limits.    

In particular I don't think infrastructure should be operated by private business because that limits the capabilities of what *other* businesses can do. I look at infrastructure like the soil that other businesses need to grow. The healthier the soil, the faster, bigger, and stronger these other businesses flourish.    

Plus capitalism likes to step on and forget individuals; and what is even the point of all this if not to ultimately benefit a society of individuals? So I am always in favour of social safety nets, basic employee rights like holiday/sick leave/etc, and free at the point-of-delivery healthcare.     

I think Communism is a great concept, but I think it tries to pretend that people aren't greedy and selfish: which is why it will always fail. Even if you look at countries like China which most would argue are highly successful, you can see that they have a massive amount of corruption and inequality going on (maybe even more than some capitalist countries).    

PS - Infrastructure in this context is something that both businesses and individuals rely on e.g. roads, railways, phones, internet, water, gas, electricity, the postal service.    

PPS - What I would love to see is for the government to maintain the internet ""pipe"" but to not resell it to end-users. Essentially the government maintains/deploys it, and then re-sells access to ISPs (both consumer and business) who then in turn sell it to the public.

Y'know, at one time, in the 1970s, a full *one third* of the UK population lived in council houses [[cite](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs)]. 

The whole world didn't fall apart, back then, just because poor people weren't obliged to sleep on the streets.

I mean, don't you enjoy being able to buy the odd videogame or a new computer occasionally? Don't you like being able to run a car, drive an hour to visit your friends, go and eat out? Don't you think stuff like that might be sufficient motivation for people to work?

I absolutely fucking love entrepreneurism. I love that I can decide to make a better piece of furniture, offer to clean your car or design websites, and that you and I between us can haggle a market price for the work I do. That seems fair and useful and it seems to work very well. 

But I have no idea why our ""capitalist"" society bundles that up with allocating wealth to those who have never earned it. And I'm not talking here about the dole, or benefits or the welfare state - that's a piss in the ocean. I am constantly staggered how people can talk about how poor people should have to work for a living, and never consider applying that principle to those who are born rich. Those who were born rich and who, unearned, have an easy and comfortable life account for 10 times, 100 times, the wealth of the idle poor.  They are thus 10 times or 100 times the problem, and it is them that should be the focus of our concern.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I would argue that a ""pure capitalist"" system has been discredited, several times.

I'd agree, although I'd also argue that a pure capitalist system (as envisaged by to-the-bone capitalist free marketeers) has never existed and is frankly an impossibility.  Indeed, employing the original definition of capitalism (use of the State to privilege capital owners, basically mercantilism or rent-seeking - see above), free-market capitalism is an oxymoron - since the market can never be free so long as those with large concentrations of capital use it to secure political and economic dominance.

&gt;I think Communism is a great concept, but I think it tries to pretend that people aren't greedy and selfish.

A communist would probably argue that people are greedy and selfish principally because of capitalism, they are raised from the egg under conditions of ruthless competition and exploitation.  There are certainly societies where such norms aren't normal, or even acceptable, but they grow fewer every year as capitalism spreads.

&gt;Even if you look at countries like China which most would argue are highly successful, you can see that they have a massive amount of corruption and inequality going on (maybe even more than some capitalist countries). 

I don't think many communists would accept modern China as a model of a communist society.  Most traditional communists would say not since Deng Xiaoping took office, and many others, particularly the more anarcho-flavoured communists, would say never.",0,1348925409,null,0,false,0,c6f3tsl,t3_10nv9o,t1_c6f3tsl,t1_c6f3qrh,null,1430020264,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"What a game. Sahin has been absolutely fantastic this week. Once he gets back to full match fitness, I think he'll be one of the best midfielders in the EPL. He already has 3 goals and 4 assists in 4 games. He just reads the game so well. He's not the fastest or most explosive, but he knows where to be at what time. Most importantly, it looks like he's actually having fun out there on the pitch. He's enjoying playing for LFC.

We have 6 solid midfielders (if we count Suso as a winger). I don't remember ever saying that before. Each match day, it will be weird because 3 of them will be left out. Either way, Rodgers will have made the correct decision. It's absolutely incredible.

I think everyone played well today except for Skrtel and Reina. They didn't play poorly, really, but their performances definitely stood out as a whole tier below their teammates. I honestly think that Skrtel has been our worst defender so far this season, which is strange to say since he's been so incredibly consistent in the past couple years.

The youngsters all played very well. Wisdom was a bit out of position a couple times, but I think that's because he's usually a centre back rather than a right back. He's still been incredible considering what he's been thrown into. Sterling was quiet in the first half, but definitely not in the second. I attribute that to the fact that our players seemed to be looking for Sahin a lot more in the attacking third, which is actually good so that there's less pressure on Sterling to be the only creator. Suso has really impressed me in the past week. He even used his right foot a bit. It was nice, yet strange, to see.

We keep performing very well. If we can keep performing like this, I have absolutely no worries about where our team will end up. Did we ever score 5 goals last season? We've already done it twice this season!

true,xeraphine,lfc12,,"Great performance away from home. 67% possession, Gerrard and Allen with 93 and 95 passe attempts apiece, bossing the midfield. Suarez's goals! And 5 total? Let's score 5 against Stoke and another 5 against Reading! 

Some notes from me: 

-I think Suarez is starting to cut out the shenanigans a bit, but I don't think he'll get decisions anytime soon. I do believe it'll happen eventually though, and I believe that Suarez realizes what he's got to do to get there.

-Sahin's playing perfectly in the hole, with much more discipline and incredibly intelligent runs. He and Gerrard were swapping quite a bit, but I felt when Sahin was in the AM spot he was a far calmer presence and a far more incisive, while Gerrard was more incisive from the CM spot. When Gerrard was up at AM he hit a goal and looks to shoot. I think it's a good system. I also don't know how we're going to slot Lucas back into this team, which is a good problem to have.

-Wisdom looked incredibly solid, so Enrique needs to step it up. Can't believe we lose Kelly and this kid steps up and Liverpool doesn't miss a beat. There was definitely more than one instance where he was under pressure from one or two Norwich players and still managed to play it out of the back. I can see why BR likes him.

-Allen isn't going to get much love from Hansen or Shearer after this game, but it's not his job to hit the incisive passes. He was a calming influence, won the ball well many many times, and kept possession with 91/95 passes complete. I don't care if it's backwards or sideways, he always gets himself into space, available for a pass, and is a vital component of this team.

-Sterling was fantastic, as always, while Assaidi was good, but not electric. I think he should be given a chance to start.

-Suso was in the Borini role, and was more involved with the buildup, but definitely didn't get into as many goal-threatening positions as Borini does. I think that's a good spot for him, as when he drifts into the middle we've essentially got 4 midfielders. 

-Johnson, Agger were both solid. Not much to call home about. Johnson was partially at fault for the first goal, as he allowed too much space between him and Agger (maybe Agger should have stepped up a bit too), which gave a Norwich player too much space to shoot. Reina did fumble the shot, but Johnson/Agger shouldn't have allowed that space. 

-Some people are going to criticize Skrtel for his mistake that led to Norwich's second goal, but I think a secondary culprit here was BR's decision to reward Carragher with some PL time. When Agger and Skrtel play together, Skrtel tends to be a bit less aggressive, but I think he feels the need to overcompensate for Carragher's lack of pace when Jamie's back there. He was uncharacteristically aggressive in attacking the ball and came up short, leading to an easy goal.

-Again, I don't blame Reina 100% for the first goal, but I was happy to see how passionate he was about his own mistake. He's definitely got the fire lit, and hopefully he can become more instinctive and comfortable about his role as a distributor so he can focus more on stopping shots.",0,1348935332,null,0,false,0,c6f5g6m,t3_10o4si,t1_c6f5g6m,t3_10o4si,null,1430021101,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

- The back four, moreso than the rest of the team, still seem to be learning when to press and when to back off.

true,panickedthumb,pertwee,Pertwee,"Here's what I want to see, leading into it.

On the fields of Trenzalore, when the question is asked and must be answered, The Doctor's name will be uttered. Hopefully the audience doesn't hear it, because that would take a lot of mystery away from the show. At any rate, since his name is shrouded in such mystery, he used it as a trigger for the time lock. Saying his name again unlocks it. This is the cliffhanger into the 50th anniversary episode(s).

So now The Doctor is obviously pissed off that his work is undone, scared for his life and the lives of everyone in the universe, but hopeful... because now he has a chance to do it right. A chance to end the Time War without causing the end of two species (even though he obviously missed the mark on the daleks the first time around).

But in order to pull this off, he needs help. (If Eccleston is willing) he gets the version of himself who was born out of the Time War. He breaks down the barriers of universes to get his most faithful companion, Rose, and another version of himself who was born in war. He scours the universe to find the man who can't die, Jack Harkness. He enlists the help of UNIT, and Kate Stewart, who has heard all the stories of The Doctor from her dad, and has seen him in action, is more than happy to help. Jack, perhaps, gets Torchwood back in service to some degree (because Gwen is awesome). 

But this, the most important part, he has to go back to get the version of himself that (presumably) won the Time War. Paul McGann. 

If McCoy is available, he should come along too-- he has aged well and still looks mostly the same as he did when we see his regeneration in the '96 movie. Pertwee's and Troughton's sons look a *lot* like them, so they could come along to reprise their fathers' roles. The other actors who have played the Doctor have aged out of looking the part, and since we've seen them regenerate, it might be too jarring to have them come back looking far older than they should.

So we have an epic blow-out with multiple Doctors, fighting again to save the universe from the Time War, and what we get out of it is a return of the Time Lord society. Having been shown how wrong they were through the course of the episode(s) they go back to their old ways, not like they were in The End of Time.

Yeah, I've kinda thought this through.

EDIT: Thanks to the reminder from nanonanopico, Jenny should definitely be back for this. If I recall correctly, and I don't know how much truth there is to it, Jenny was supposed to just die in that episode but Moffat asked RTD to keep her alive.

The version of River from Silence of the Library is one version. All the others are the one we saw being kidnapped in Demon's Run.

Refereeing was terrible though, how we didn't get a penalty for the foul on Suarez was a joke. 

An entertaining game no doubt. But yeah, hopefully we can start to master this style, and attract 1 or 2 more players in January / next summer. I think we'll finish the season really well, but because we've been slow out the blocks (and dropped points due to cheap mistakes.) 

Realistically, i think we could win Europa &amp; both domestic cups because of the faith in the youth is fantastic and our ability to rotate.

But the first time River met the Doctor wasn't his LAST time seeing her. It was in the middle of their story from his perspective (his timeline).

""The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life...

* There are *a lot* of encouraging signs going forward. With each match we play we seem to be showing improvement.

* Love the attitude that Suso and Sterling have. Their youthful naivety coupled with their natural skills and football intelligence seems to give them a fearless quality that other players (ahemDowningahem) do not seem to have.

* I think our next seven matches are in the city of Liverpool (one at Goodison). That's a lot of time for our squad to rest, relax, train (instead of travel) and really get all the nuances of Rodgers' tactics.

It's pretty thin stuff. The scripts require, of course, that no character gets hurt - characters cannot be hurt by the insults: those are the rules, without which the script stops being funny very quickly.
  
So in other words, the characters are wrapped in invisible rubber suits and they're batting each other with invisible rubber chickens, saying senselessly insulting, unrealistic things at each other and making no real emotional dent in each other. I have to admit that I can't understand how this doesn't get really tired to more people. There is so little impact in the dialogue, so little has any actual significance, the emotional stakes are too low. So what are audiences laughing at? My guess it's that this rubber chicken has blue stripes, that rubber chicken has yellow stripes.

The cast, maybe for the first time were on their A game for this episode and it shows. 

I just beg Moffat not to pull an RTD and bring them back in a couple of seasons for a guest show, even for the 50th. This should be the last we hear from them, to see them again would ruin the emotional impact of this episode.

There are ongoing investigations and inquiries being carried out. Anything mentioned before they've gone to trial with the evidence is speculation. The Times investigation also came to the conclusion that the police had possibly ignored the severity of the accusations because the girls were in a care home/of a particular background which had higher incidence of prostitution - which is another speculation.

&gt;Criminals are criminals and should not be able to get away with their crimes because the institutions want to be P.C.

Having said that, discussion.  It didn't feel like a typical episode, but then I suppose it was never going to.  Started out feeling like a David Lynch movie, but then a moment of tension when the trio were shown hanging out in the park like normal people.  From that point on, you just knew it was going to be harrowing.

Good emotions shown by Matt Smith as usual.  River felt like a bit of a plot device rather than a legitimate character in this one, but I suppose they wanted the whole family together for this one.

After the paradox, when they appeared in the graveyard, it was painful knowing that something bad was about to happen - that was real edge of the seat stuff!  And then: when the Doctor is begging her to come back into the TARDIS, there was only ever going to be one choice she'd make, and he damn well knew it.

But now it looks like they can be bronze and all sorts of humanoid figures, so does this mean that they can transform, or maybe take over statues. Maybe they are a conscious that can hop to other entities, because the statue of liberty was visibly built by human and is hollow on the inside showing they dont have organs and bits.

Roller-coaster ride, but if you look at it - it was their best possible fate. The Doctor was always dropping in on them, even when the wanted to get on with their lives, he set-up shop in their living room and found a way to drag them on adventures. 

Not only did he need to be separated from them, they needed a chance for a life together - without all the excitement. They needed their own life - and the Angels gave them one. 

Really sad, but at the same time: wouldn't you want to be either one of them? To live out your life, peacefully and happily, with the one you love? And to die together, not leaving each other until the very end? That's how I'd want to go.

This document shows that in a test area where proactive culling took place there was a respective reduction in bovine TB but a short term increase in the surrounding area, in the ensuing 5 yrs a reduction of 28 % of the cases reported comparatively to a non culled area. It also extols the virtues of inoculation of the badger population which I am not against, the bigger problem is not being able to inoculate cattle because of EU laws. Even though there is an admission that some facts may be missing, as I have stated earlier there is a 10 year study identifying that the transmission and the reporting of new cases of bovine TB is reduced in the short term 5 to 10 years after pro active culling. Therefore freeing up money and time to complete the much needed research. Rather than complaining and making legal challenges, why not in the short term accept that there is a need for this to go ahead and there will be some benefits obviously not to the badgers, but with the caveat that a project will be launched in conjunction with conservationists to investigate the problem to the extent that is needed, i.e badger counts, mapping of tb breakouts current and historical comparison with badger population and infection rates of badger population mapping of culling and non culling and alike. However for the time being the cull is going to go ahead and as much as you want it to fail there will be a reduction in the cases of bovine TB due to the culling once that is identified it may well become national practice to proactively cull. The facts are that bovine tb is spiralling out of control, there are EU restrictions on inoculating cattle, there are methods in place to restrict movement destroy infected animals and control the spread of this disease in domestic animals, yet it still seems to spread there are current investigations into other animal species that are carriers but the most likely source is that of the badger. If it was the case that the disease was being spread by other animals I would expect the same course of action to be implemented and would expect a similar public backlash.

&gt; I honestly hope something terrible happens to her just to show all of you completely out-of-reality troglodytes.

&gt;you give a shit about one family in England but OH NO fuck those families who actually lost a family member, that shit happens all the time.

Now you're making strawman arguments. I never at any point expressed how I felt about anyone else being kidnapped, or anyone else being killed in any situation. I merely pointed out here....

However, there is a whole community in England that knows this girl and the teacher and she was very much alive. The police were merely appealing for information relating to her.

Either everyone gets it, or nobody gets it? Even if it actually helped save someone, they shouldn't get it. As you said...

&gt;I honestly hope something terrible happens to her just to show all of you completely out-of-reality troglodytes.

Enough said.

Also, let's go along with the whole 'baby angels' thing, why did they give them that stupid laugh, that sounded ridiculously like the dolls from 'Night Terrors'?

Amy and Rory's departure was, to me, the only good thing about the episode. I spent the whole episode waiting for them to be offed, and I was so glad it finally came. I didn't care about Amy's performance, which to be honest was pretty 'television generic', it sounded like it could have been on any supernatural/sci-fi/fantasy drama, I didn't care about Rory not getting a goodbye, what pissed me off is that I was so happy that they were finally gone when they jumped off, only to wake up again in the graveyard, to find a 'survivor'. Would it not have been easier just end it with the double suicide, rather than waste another five-ten minutes on that? 

And finally, the Doctor. What. A. Twat. He sees RORY about to jump off as well as Amy, and all he cares about is Amy's death. We don't see him shout his name even though he shouts Amy's two or three times. Not a blink or a single tear about Rory, nor do we see him visit child Rory.

&gt;When I said ""out-of-reality troglodytes"" I was referring to you, and many other people like you who consider this more important

So you still consider that you honestly hope (your words) something terrible happens to this girl, so that you'd be right and I'd be wrong? 

That's still fucking disgraceful.

&gt;You obviously cared more about the kidnapping story otherwise you would have not made a point to have this argument. 

Not really. But what does it matter if I do? I can still follow this story and hope for the best result for this girl and her family, whilst feeling sorry for those who've lost their lives elsewhere. I don't judge life by how TV and news companies tell me too. 

I'm smart enough to be able to make and share my own opinions in a civilised manner without wishing some girl to suffer for it.

As I pointed out, by spreading the story in the UK news, they had a bigger chance of finding the girl. It's pretty simple. By spreading the story of a plane crash, that does nothing but inform.

&gt;Also, saying that I argue like a child and using the term ""strawman arguments""? Yeah, great one there

That, in itself, is another strawman argument. I called you a child for trying to somehow insult me by refering to me liking the DM.

I called it a Strawman argument, because I didn't say what you've attributed me to say. 

Likewise, these are two entirely separate things I've mentioned, and you've put them together into something else.

&gt;***When I said I hope ""something terrible happens to her"" it was purely in the hypothetical manner that I know for a fact it would make the headlines once as again as a more important story.***

***Seriously? Are you seriously saying that after, and I quote...***

&gt;***I honestly hope something terrible happens to her***

***...that you only meant it hypothetically? You hypothetically honestly hope something terrible happens to her? Seriously? Are you fucking stupid?***

***At least have the balls to say your comment was wrong, rather than make up some bullshit like that to actually justify it. Hypothetically? WTF?***

true,NeoMegaRyuMKII,tennant,Tennant,"The idea is good but I disagree a little. Keep in mind that Amy/Rory could easily have written where they ended up knowing that future Doctor will get it and take them on more adventures. 

Further, an interview with Arthur Darvill in Entertainment Weekly in August said that not everyone will come out alive. Now I do not know if that means Amy, Rory, Rory's father, River, or someone else (Darvill did not reveal who it is) but it is supposed to be far more tragic than ""they went back in time and lived happily ever after.""

 I believe that it will be something like this:

The Angels will have arrived in Manhattan from the cracks we saw in Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone in season 5. The Angels are essentially much more powerful since they have time energy but also basically Anti-Time energy from the cracks. One angel manages to attack Rory, turning HIM into a Weeping Angel, with no memories of Amy. Amy is obviously distraught and wants to get to Rory with the common ""touch of a loved one"" trope. It initially seems to work but ultimately Amy realizes she lost Rory. She lets the Rory angel touch her in the vain hope she will be sent little enough back to see him again but she ends up in POMPEII (shortly before events of Fires of Pompeii).

The Sullom Voe oil and gas terminal in Shetland is the largest in Europe and this is where most of the North Sea oil comes in. As part of the conditions for its exploration and drilling, the oil companies give the Shetland Islands a lot of money considering that there are only about 20,000 people there.

Therefore, the council can afford to massively subsidise public services: villages of a few hundred people have their own full-size heated swimming pools and public transport is cheap. The whole trip from Lerwick to Shetland (3 bus journeys and 2 ferries) cost under £10 return and was over 150 miles!

Sure the school won't like it, which is why they'd do their very best to get rib of such a person.

Remember how Amy could remember the soldiers who were erased because she became 'unstuck' from time before meeting them? River was unstuck from time from her very conception. She has no memories from before being stuck of Amy or Rory or The Doctor to be erased, thus she can remember all of it.

Furthermore, as River's entire existence goes, the cracks don't affect causality. The world still exists as if the erased pieces had existed. They just...don't. It's like there's a hole in the universe where something should be. And everything behaves as if it were. But it isn't.

true,bear1,null,null,"Does anyone else agree that the flickering lights and mentions of Christmas were foreshadowing Amy and Rory leaving, and possibly the next Christmas episode? Or was it something else? It was kind of not surprising since Amy and Rory's fate were spoilered a long time ago. Although it does make a lot of sense especially because the episode ended with a fade to black on a picture of Amelia, Winter Quay, and the upcoming Christmas episode. Was Christmas mentioned in this episode? 

edit: Put this in another thread but felt like putting it here too

I think the lightbulb themes were just foreshadowing to the fate of what happened this episode. (No spoiler warnings since it's a spoiler thread?) The ending shot was even a picture of Amelia that *faded to black.* I think that's why they had another mention of the lightbulb, and I think that was even a callback ot the life of Ponds thing that aired before the episode so it served as a sort of bookends. The Angels have a theme of flickering lights, and this is where Amy and Rory's journey ended.

Do you know why they keep mentioning Christmas though? Is it just foreshadowing to the new episodes this Christmas? I thought it was a bit fitting that Winter Quay was invovled in the time paradox but I don't know how to connect it beyond that.

There was also a returning theme of a mirror, when the Doctor was adjusting his hair and tie. I can't tell if those were just coincidental or not though. 


And yeah, if the flickering lights were foreshadowing Amy and Rory's departure....it all ended up pretty moot since we knew about that for months now.

Do you know why they keep mentioning Christmas though? Is it just foreshadowing to the new episodes this Christmas? I thought it was a bit fitting that Winter Quay was invovled in the time paradox but I don't know how to connect it beyond that.

There was also a returning theme of a mirror, when the Doctor was adjusting his hair and tie. I can't tell if those were just coincidental or not though.

I wondered why I had ever liked Rose in the first place, because from hindsight, she was an OAG to the Doctor and an annoyance in so many ways. Then Martha left, and I was devastated, but soon realised she, too, was just a child in love and a burden if she had stayed. Donna entered the story, and at first I didn't like her but later on, I loved her. After her exit, I thought again, ""well, that's bad, I'm going to miss her"", but alas - I was over her pretty soon indeed. 

Long story short - I loved Amy. I loved Rory. I really am going to miss them, but at the end of the day, we'll get over them because face it, Oswin already proved herself to be amazing and we'll get used to it and love it regardless of who is still in the series.

That said, my favourite companion must be River Song. I know many people on here think she's a typical Mary-Sue character with no depth, but I've always thought she had great potential as a character. It seems Moffat is going to use her for exactly that, after the latest episode where she takes up her role as the Doctor's wife, and their chemistry is better than ever.

2. As a youth you'd normally stay they, once you get to the reserve or 16+ and have your parent and guardians permission you decide whether you stay overnight or come home the same day.

3. When the senior team was in Europe (dont know if they still do it) we would go on a European tour during the summer. Every part of Europe plays or specialise in a certain type of style but none of them where near on the standard of English football, our players are quick to adapt and learning.

4. This is a very long and complex question, but quickly BR is the ONLY man for the job, most managers can only do one of 2 things, improve the club or fix the club, BR has some how found the balance and he's managing to do both. With Swansea he preformed a modern footballing miracle and took a side from the championship to 11th(?) in the prem with the second most complete passes in Europe behind Barcelona..Imagine what he's going to able to accomplish with players at Liverpools calibre..We also only have 12 fit senior players, this forced him to turn to the youth players/reserves and look how they have paid off...

5. BUY: Sahin (R.Madrid-LFC), Tello (Barca) SELL: Downing sorry..

6. Train your weaknesses into strengths and ignore anything negative and turn it into fuel. at 13 I showed up a tournament full of 16 years olds, got approached by a west ham scout that then took a job at liverpool and invited me to trials.

7. Yes, your never too old, ever (except 26+) but you need to train EVERYDAY, keep pushing yourself, its sounds like hero bullshit but you need to be able to get focused and get into a mindset that nobody can break.

8. Yes, they starve you for attention, the majority of feedback you get is semi negative, a lot of you did this wrong you need to improve here, but they break you down and it makes you tough. Back when I was there there was virtually no interest in the youth team, nobody had really broken through since Owen and nobody looked to be anytime soon being the newly crowned champions of Europe, now we know everything about everyone.

9. This. the stranded of play today is higher than it has EVER been, players are expected to be outstanding in all areas of their game not just one like in the old days. Everything these days has been scientifically engineered or proven to improve a players performance, the nutrition is better, the equipment is better, the training is superior, they may have been impressive then but very few would even be recognised if they were to play in the era",0,1348959860,null,0,false,0,c6fanr3,t3_10oj01,t1_c6fanr3,t1_c6f9gko,null,1430023548,40,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,40

Will take a lot of time to get used to the more 'Mediterranean' style of play we are trying to adopt, which incidentally is what Roy Hodgson is trying to do with the England team.

edit: it's apparently dickish for me to give a long explanation (due to not knowing how much the parent commenter knew about the series), so here's a TL;DR - the man in the picture is Rory's dad, Brian. He isn't going to see Rory ever again.

----
Original comment:

1) The man on the right is Rory's father, Brian.

2) Rory (and Amy) went missing in the episode, never to be seen again after that point in time.

3) The Doc's apologising to Brian because he (Brian) is never going to see his son and daughter-in-law again.

Now that we've established those facts... someone who hasn't watched the episode can guess that something bad has happened to (at least) Rory. There's the spoiler. It's no secret that the character was going to leave the show, but now someone who hasn't seen the episode will be aware that the character left on bad terms (pretty much, death) and not good terms.

Did I need to spell that out? You're lucky I'm very bored. Personally, I think people who haven't seen the latest episode (of any show, really) should steer clear of their subreddits until they have.

I liked the episode and thought it played out very nicely but I can't help feeling it was a little... undeserved. I am not one to really call for more exposition but this time I wish they had explained it a little better. It felt that they just came up with the fixed time thing to paint over that piece of plot than have it be a plot piece itself. 

The whole there is one angel that survived just did not sit with me as we never really got to know what the angles motives were or why they where running a battery farm. There was a big opportunity to layer some, very subtle, arc point in here and make the Angels slightly more than they are. To me it somewhat cheapened the ponds exit by essentially being bested by a monster of the week. There was no design to it or even all the much plot just a way to emotionally send off the ponds.

I can somewhat understand the need for a clean break before bringing in the new companion but The Doctor looking for *revenge* against the creature, or their master, for essentially killing his friends would have sent The Doctor down a very dark path. Instead he has been set up to be depressed but given the best chance of getting over it, given the circumstances.

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"&gt;I'm not sure if you've mis-quoted, but very few off your responses seem to relate to the quote you've made

I don't quite understand how it can not be clear. Why would I post responses in relation to a quotation I've made? I post responses in relation to things you've said, which have so far been shocking.

&gt; If my so arguments are supposedly ""strawman"", then I deem your entire argument ""strawman"".

That makes no sense. My argument is pretty clear, and straight forward.

1) This is a story of interest to a number of people who currently reside in the UK, and extra publicity of this story could lead to a quicker resolution. Publicity of a plane crash is simply informative, for a larger number of people in the UK. Whether a company makes money from it is irrelevant if it results in a solution where the family is reunited.

2) Saying that you ""hypothetically"" honestly wish someone was to suffer, makes no sense and is a poor attempt to cover what I hope is in fact a terribly clumsy choice of words.

3) A strawman argument relies on essentially changing someone's words to meet your argument. I've extensively quoted you in my posts to make it precisely clear what I'm talking about. I'm not sure how it could be any clearer.

Please explain to me what where I've turned something you've said into something else? And I hope you don't say the 'hypothetically' bit.

&gt;You've resorted to name-calling and abuse, which is sad really considering I thought you were going to be a person worthy of civilised conversation.

Yes, wishing suffering on another person is *soooo* civilized. But that's right, you only hypothetically honestly wished for something bad to happen to her. How can you possibly do that? What does that even mean? You don't wish harm to come to her, but you honestly do? Can you say that with a straight face?

How many ways can that be understood? How would it show up the media? How would it possibly show up 'trogladites' like me? All it would do is extend the story that you apparently hate so much for even longer.

The fact that you continue to stand by this line and haven't retracted it is simply astounding. 

I'm calling you an fucking idiot because this demonstrates it in spades, and I hope it comes to roost and you remember it.

Why you didn't you simply say ""that's not what I meant, I meant that I wish a story would occur that showed the hypocritical manner of the media"" or something like that? Instead you dug yourself a large hole and leapt in by trying to justify it. If I said I hypothetically hope you die of aids, WTF does that even mean? Then throw in the word 'honestly' and it becomes a clusterfuck of a sentence.

&gt;I'm not sure if you just picked out the bits that you thought you could make the most ignorant retort to, but your whole reply is flawed and, in the end, has just shown that you think in a completely illogical manner

You say this, but don't say why or where? I thought you were up for a civilized discussion? How am I meant to respond to empty comments like this? I've clearly responded to the things you've said and pointed out where I think they're wrong or dumb.

&gt;And I didn't say what I said was wrong

Well, you should for the numerous reasons I've pointed out and you've failed to answer. If you do anything, just respond to my TL;DR.

&gt;Absolutely laughable really

Yes, quite. But I've no idea why you think you should be laughing.

**TL;DR, just explain how...**

The episode with the silurians (homoreptilia) - you see rory and amy waving from the distance (and then when rory is erased from time amy is on her own) because they were off reliving memories. How did they manage this? The impression I was given was that they were held captive by the angels. Were they able to leave? It would explain why they manage to be there in their old age. If so, the doctor saw them waving in the distance, so surely he'd be able to go and meet them there - I assume the entirety of earth and its history is not off-limits to the tardis - and meet them one final time (or go on adventures with them again, yaaay!)

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; How far could a physically average kid get with just hard work?

I was that kid and in my opinion all the best players are too.

Natural ability will only get you so far, Im a big believer that anybody can train themselves to do anything, its just how hard you train and mental discipline.

My brother was naturally gifted player, he sprinted nationally, was consecutively the top goalscorer in both the school leagues and local leagues every year he played, was strong, tall, he was gifted.

I was short, skinny, poor balance, slow, if I was a horse they would have put me down. but I wanted to play football at a level where people would talk about me in the same respect as they talk about my brother.

So sun or rain (and i mean a LOT of rain) I would be there with friends or by myself playing football and pushing myself. How many 11-12 years old have you ever seen out by themselves everyday regardless of weather working on their agility or passing and shooting, etc.

So eventually I hit a level that was for my age, almost ridiculous. I used to play 5 a side **teams** by **myself** for fun and for the most part win (if I took them on one player at a time), I would stop, start, change direction, feint, swap feet, turn, its almost impossible to describe it because it becomes second nature you know where the player is going to be and what they are going to do, but I wont lie to you it takes a lot and a lot of practice to get there.

But I take this attitude with anything in life, if you want it, work for it, prove the doubters wrong. 

That being said the players that REALLY get through are the thinkers, the guys that have a brilliant mental diciplines are the ones that make it.

Look at Steven Gerrard off the pitch he's smiling, laughing then on the pitch, he's stone faced thats because he's in his own zone, not a lot of players can do that",0,1348965775,null,0,false,0,c6fbx3h,t3_10oj01,t1_c6fbx3h,t1_c6fa0ls,null,1430024143,26,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,26

**BODHRÁN** = *A traditional Irish drum, a wee bit larger than Griffins waist.*

**FENIAN** = *See Republican** *in addition to this has also been used in a derogatory manor to insult and abuse. Commonly to attack Catholics in the North.* 

**NICK GRIFFIN** = *A physically repulsive, morally repugnant disgrace.

true,AhhBisto,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I wouldn't be sad if any of the RTD companions came back. For me, the story of Rose, Mickey Martha and Donna has ended and does not need revisiting and they are only one chapter in the large story of the Doctor.

The story has to concentrate on the Doctor himself, too many iterations though and the story loses itself and becomes just a cameo heavy piece of crap.

Three iterations maximum will do. 9 (if Eccleston would even come back), 10 (David Tennant would DEFINITELY return) and of course 11 (Matt Smith is signed on until 2014) but if, and it's likely, that Eccleston will not participate, this gives Moffat the opportunity to go and get one of the older guard.

Paul McGann would be a great choice as he's never had more than one screen appearance. Peter Davison too would be awesome, he showed in Time Crash that he hadn't missed a beat and still looks good for his age, some cheeky banter with 10 would be good as they did already meet! 

Having the others is very difficult as they haven't aged well, bless them, and i'm not sure how well the audience would take to a different portrayal like Hurndall in the 20th anniversary episode when he replaced the deceased William Hartnell as the First Doctor.

When Amy goes to touch the Angel, you know that she has to end up with Rory, because how could she not? But this is Moffat, and so you really don't know anything, and to see that they lived together and know that they were truly happy, even if they weren't with the Doctor, that made me happy.

You know, it's rant time. This shit pisses me off.

These actors to stand on the show until it either get's canceled or the actors croak? 

If you had even an ounce of respect for the actors, the writers, or the characters, you'd accept the fact that it's sometimes time to move on.

I just watched ""Angels Take Manhattan"", and sobbed, like a small child. Amy and Rory were MY first companions, and I will love them eternally, until the day **I** die.

o With the amount of noise and shaking of the area where TSOL was walking, how did nobody else look out their window and see it walking miles away from it's resting point?

o Could River Song not use her Time Vortex Manipulator to pull them back out if it's better than a TARDIS and ""less bulky"" to push through tricky time events?

While I do agree that there are tiny details people latch onto that often times don't mean anything (check out /r/breakingbad if you want to see really good examples of this) but the seven thing really isn't crazy or tiny. 

Edit to add more evidence: This conversation plays out between the Shakri hologram thing and The Doctor...

&gt;Shakri: The Shakri exist in all of time. And none. We travel alone. And together. The seven.

&gt;The Doctor: The Shakri craft, connected to Earth through seven portals in seven minutes. Ah. But why?

Clearly we haven't seen the last of the Shakri and you get the feeling that there is a higher power at work here. That a much larger arch has been developing throughout the season.

Alone, 8 activates it, expecting to die completely. He regenerates into the Ninth Doctor, who is angry that he did not die with the activation of The Moment.

true,writesinwhite,null,null,"That's kind of stereotypical. I mean, i get what you're saying, fat chicks can identify with someone that isn't picture perfect more easily than a perfect redhead. But all women, not just ""fat chicks,"" have something about their bodies that they are not happy with and can relate with Rose.

I don't like rose because she is almost always the damsel in distress, and bimbo-like. She was also a huge bitch to Micky.

I liked Amy immediately, because she was sweet as a child, hot and sexy as an adult, but also smart, loving, and adventurous.

I love Tennant because he was, in a word, brilliant. He loved being the Doctor and you just had to watch one episode to know it. He claimed he was the biggest DW fan as a kid and wanted to be the Doctor. He had his biggest dream come true, and his determination and enthusiasm was what i liked. Not because he loved a horse teethed girl, but because he was the walking description of confident.

11, however is slightly (or more so) aloof, awkward and otherwise weird. We got to see a completely new doctor, where when he regenerated into 10, he had this whole unconscious thing going on, and it just seemed like he was the same person in different skin. virtually nothing about him changed. The overhaul of characters, the different look, and the quirkyness that was matt smith poured out of him and i loved him immediately. this was the doctor i was looking for. Though confident, he also was able to separate himself from others, he acted alien, and in that it was fitting. he wore old man's clothes on a young lanky body, and his jutting brow made him look evermore strange. This is the Doctor i pictured since i was told of the show, an out of this world sort of brilliant man that didn't fit in but did at the same time.

That was a little long winded so here's this

TL;DR- not all ""Fat chicks"" are the same. Rose is my least favorite companion in the revived DW, and her massive overbite, though strangely endearing, didn't contribute much to her likableness. Amy is great. Period. And in writing this, i realized that in the last year my favorite doctor changed from 10 to 11, because Matt smith portrays a doctor i envisioned from the get-go.

although i may be an exception to your suspicion in the case that i have no problem with my or anyone else's body, beanpole or not. so i might be biased (or unbiased, as it were).",0,1348976139,null,0,false,0,c6fe2tj,t3_10oyid,t1_c6fe2tj,t1_c6fdg3b,null,1430025227,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Overall, it sucks that during the first commercial they just came out and said that this was their departure.

It's not like they needed to reveal this to increase viewership.  Just knowing that this was a weeping angels episode would have been enough to have a large viewing.

In addition, the Doctor's line from ATCM about ""too many people [having] died because of [his] mercy"" still doesn't seem to fit. If episodes 2-4 take place after this one, which they must since he hasn't met the next companion yet, then what could he be talking about? They didn't exactly die, and the Doctor didn't exactly show mercy to anyone.

On that point, the details of his reverse-timeline Pond-visiting still remains somewhat unclear.

When Amy and Rory jump, everyone ends up back in the graveyard, right? The Doctor goes on about how the paradox created a huge explosion and the Angels were killed.

Apparently, Moffat did terribly with the Angels. When the Doctor and River were standing alone in Rory's room, there were 4 Angels surrounding them, all which were able to move. I guess when the Doctor screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" to Amy and Rory, River may have been looking at the Angel?

A beautiful ending for the Ponds, and a great Angel episode, I'm really glad they went back to the original Angels- none of that Image of an Angel crap, none of the Angel in Amy's eye crap, and none of the outright killing, just zapping them into the past. Those are the Angels that scare me, not the ones that just kill indiscriminately. 

I'd also like to point out that several of our reoccuring themes happened in this episode. 

* The #7 - The room that the first detective found himself in was 702

* The Lightbulb on the top of the Tardis - Doctor and River's conversation about changing it, and having just changed it

* Lights flickering - all the time

* Doctor Who? - So we finally find out that the Doctor has been going around and erasing himself from record, probably got the idea from when Oswin deleted him out of the Dalek's memories. I like that River didn't just get pardoned, because she didn't actually kill the doctor, but because the Doctor doesn't exist- turns him back into a sort of boggy man.

true,Daithi_2024,irish,Éire,"Alright this is all related to the 100 year celebrations of the Ulster Convent which this dick attended.

On 11th, April 1912, the British Prime Minister introduced the Third Home Rule Bill which was meant to eventually lead to granting Ireland self-government within the framework of the United Kingdom, basically think slightly Devo-max today for Scotland only more extensive. Under Home Rule Ireland would have remained part of the United Kingdom but had it's own courts parliament and laws and that stuff.

This massively pissed off the Unionists, who being loyal members of Britain threatened not only their then fellow British citizens as the other Irish people who wanted Home Rule were British citizens but also called for treason against United Kingdom and the subversion of democratic will of the British Parliament and democratic will of the people of Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

To this end they on the 28th September 1912 signed the Ulster Covenant and created the Ulster Volunteer Force on 13th January 1913. Then they armed themselves on the 24th and 25th April 1914 with almost 25,000 rifles and three million rounds of ammunition from Germany through the Larne operation and prepared to go to war with the British Government, it can be noted a 101 days after the Larne operation Britain would enter World War 1 against Germany so the Unionists basically just funded the enemy in a massive and thick way.

Anyway with the outbreak of World War 1 the threats from the Unionist population had forced the United Kingdom to put on hold the Home Rule bill. This then caused the radicalisation of the Irish independence Home Rule movement as it became apparent that democratic movement towards the Irish Parliament would be blocked through the threat of violence from the Unionists. On 25 November 1913 the Irish Volunteers was created and by the 26th July 1914 they too had got arms from Germany landing at just outside Dublin near Howth. The new call being why fight for the Belgian's right to democracy when Ireland was not to have it's own. The democrats were out and the hardliners took control of the Irish Independence movement, full independence and Republic became the goal, in 1916 the Easter Rising turned many parts of Dublin to rubble and in 1919 the Ireland unilaterally declared independence through the ratification of the 1916 Poblacht na hÉireann and our two countries entered a war that probably could and should have been avoided. 

Why today's Unionist population want to celebrate this act of treason against the government they profess to support really I don't quite get. Who exactly do they think those rifles and ammunition was likely to be used against if not their fellow British citizens.

I assume that this is because of the fact that if they were able to send him back to the Winter Quay that it would fix the paradox and set their nefarious scheme back on the rails.  Now, Rory took a different path with the suicide reset,  but it seems that the result was the same.  He was followed back by an Angel after seeing his headstone,  and sent back to the past (presumably 1938 again) to be farmed for the temporal energy the Angels live off of.  I see no other reason for them to target him specifically.  It also covers why The Doctor cant just go pick them up,  or even why he cant just go visit them later on down the line in say the 1960's.  They are trapped, repeating the same year over and over again in the temporal storm that the Angel's created, and without a ""Homing Beacon"" such as River's little tablet,  he has no way of getting back in without potentially ripping apart all of existence.  So,  while they may (hopefully) be together (since there was no evidence the residents of Winter Quay were trapped in their rooms),  they will likely spend the rest of their years together getting zapped back in time every once in awhile to feed a bunch of creepy statues.

Rory and Amy created the paradox, and they were good. They could have gone on. BUT, Rory went and saw his grave that said he died at 82 and was buried there.

So, the universe resolved it by spawning an Angel to send him back, which ensured his death and burial in the grave yard. Amy did not have a fixed point, as she had never seen the writing side of the grave, so she could have just gone on.

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"The Doctor said the Winter Quay hotel was a [battery farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_cage) - the angels ""farm"" time energy by kidnapping people and imprisoning them in a room at Winter Quay. Every time they try to leave they are sent back in time and their energy is harvested by the Angels. 

Amy and Rory's suicides had two main effects: 1) It created a paradox which as a result undid everything that happened because of Rory getting grabbed by the angel but deposited them in a different space (the graveyard). 2) It made those time-space coordinates too unstable to artifically travel (time travel, either by Tardis or vortex manipulator) to. By that, I took that to mean New York, from a start date to an end date, where all the time in the middle is too unstable to travel into.

What I think Mistah_Sh4nks is saying is, when the Angel grabbed Rory at the end, it (presumably) sent him back to the farm at Winter Quay, where he is trapped at those time/space coordinates where the Doctor can no longer travel back to rescue him. There, he would be confined to his apartment. If he tried to escape, or approached the end date of that period, he would be shuffled back in time to the beginning of that period, where he would either try to make a break for it or live to the end of the period and get sent back, or die and be removed from the premises. They never shut down the farm, their suicide created a paradox that broke the four of them free from that time period. It also created the instability, which I assume only affects efforts to travel to that point from the Ponds' departure on which means that after they were sent back to be livestock, they couldn't be rescued.

This could make the ending all the more tragic, as it can now be interpreted differently. What if Amy was wrong? What if Old Rory was the result of being sent back at the end of the episode? That could have meant that she was sent back and trapped in that year, but maybe kept apart in different rooms or something and they ended up spending those 50-odd years apart. Rory died at 82 and Amy at 87, that could mean that if Old Rory was our Rory, during the episode Amy was somewhere in Winter Quay, trapped in her own little room for possibly five more years (once again assuming they're the same age). Although, the age disparity could be explained by Amy being naturally older and/or the additional time she spent traveling with the Doctor without Rory. There's always the implied happy ending though, where Amy's sent back and lives out her life with Rory for 50-odd years in a cyclical 1939.



There's also OP's point, travelling to a space/time coordinate outside the protected area. Since they don't exist alive past 1939, the only way I see it happening is to travel to as close a time before the protected time to a place outside the protected area and go the long way in, by travelling there and waiting.  This is why I think he can't: He can't travel back into his own time stream without disastrous consequences. If he did, 1939 is a fixed point in space/time. He can't pull Rory out because he's already witnessed Rory die of old age at that fixed point. There's the possibility he could save Amy by going the long way in, but I doubt she'd be amenable to that. Considering she got herself into that situation to be with Rory, I doubt she'd leave him there even if she had the chance.


TL;DR I thought about this way too much.

**More Importantly** as scientific study you could say that The Doctor is presented with something that defies what he conventionally knows to exist. It's brand new to him. It's marvelous, to quote another Doctor it's ""FANTASTIC."" However The Doctor doesn't see it as that but a question to his reality which itself is a marvel because He knows, way more than words could justify. This is one of favorite episodes because it does present the possibility of something new, unknown, and yet it exists against all logic (in that universe).

The first/large rock you're looking for is the one between East Drive and The Pond.  I recognized the view instantly, I sat on that same rock back in June.  If you go to Google Maps, run imaginary lines westward from 61st and 62nd Streets and the rock will be right in between and just to the east of the pond.  This is the view with Essex House (160 Central Park South) in the skyline with the Doctor reading to Amy.

The second view with Rory looking up at the Doctor and asking about the book has the distinctive Plaza Hotel in the background (on the southwest corner of 59th Street and 5th Avenue) and an arch bridge with water (northernmost part of The Pond).  This view couldn't be from the first rock, you should be able to find this second spot between the bridge and amusement park/skating rink.

It's a neat camera trick in order to allow shots from two sides of the Doctor/Amy back-to-back that maintain New York establishing views and still look idyllic.

And although Moffat did kind of the same thing with Amy and Rory that RTD did with Rose Moffat did it better because instead of showing us that everything would be alright and how they got along he made it as though they truly died and ended their involvement in the Doctor's story there and made them dead to us as well by not showing us how they were.

Roughly.

Someone further down mentions that Brian is 53 in 2012. I don't know where that info comes from, but I think it's safe to say he's no older than 60, or very early 60s at any rate. Which means he wasn't born until at least 1950... 12 years after Rory dies.

All that said... I'm just going to believe it anyway. Or maybe Rory sent him a letter to be delivered at a certain date, a la Back to the Future 3.

**edit:** Of course, Rory's date of death may have changed entirely, now that the Winter Quay has been paradoxed into destruction, yes?

If he couldn't say that they'd lived a full life, and there was just no way around to admit that as a result of traveling with him, the life of someone important to him had ended?  That would destroy him.

When people were expecting Amy and Rory to just plain-old die this episode, I was really interested in seeing how it would affect the Doctor.  They didn't, so we won't get to.

Where do I even *sniff* begin.

&gt; This is the story of Amelia Pond. And this is how it ends.

Yes, it _is_. Oh dear me it so is.

**Endings**. As befits the star of a show that has refused to die since the 60's, the Doctor absolutely, positively, hates endings. There is an almost childlike simplicity to it: he hates them because they _end_. Endings are what keep taking things *away* from him. They flare, yes, but then they fade too[1].

And most of the time, the show is kind enough to be sympathetic to him. You could argue season 5's finale was a triumph of Amy *not accepting endings*.

But... sometimes, things do end. Amy's learnt that now. She's had to learn it, because she's human, and not a time lord, and she's aging, and she sees her husband aging, and her friends and family aging. And this time around, she accepts.

This is the story of Amelia Pond, the girl who waited. The girl who told the universe that she didn't care what it thought of her, that she knew the Raggedy Man would come back for her. And then he *did*, and she had adventures, and she dragged her husband with her on those adventures, and then she had a daughter, and they all learnt so much about themselves, and about the wondrous, broken figure who led her to these strange places. And then her adventures stopped. 

And she's okay with that.

And she writes an afterword, Amy does. She's trying to get the Doctor to understand that endings can be good things, can be codas, and that while that doesn't take away the pain of the ending, the ending doesn't take away the good times they shared, either.

(It's interesting how many parallels there are between this goodbye and the first time the Doctor said goodbye to Amy, actually. ""We're all stories in the end"", anyone?)

But this time around, though, it's the Doctor who's not okay with it.

Hrm!

---

&gt; Amy, please, just come back into the TARDIS...!

Sure, the Doctor hates endings, but he's still more than a thousand years old. He's handled them well before. What happened?

**Family** happened. Amy and Rory and River happened.

When the Doctor was Ten, he knew he was charismatic, and he knew he was dangerous. He tried so so so hard to avoid attracting people to him, and to avoid loving them, and he failed. And because they loved him back, they were willing to lay down their lives, and more, for him. The Lonely God, they called him, because he could not help but be above them, and because he outlived them all.

So when he became Eleven, he knew that this had to stop. He had to stop being so... so _human_. So he became alien instead.

But that didn't work. Oh, it looked like it was working, for a while, but what happened instead was that Amy, then Rory, then River became his family instead. (And then literally, when he married River.) A quieter bond, and a bond that requires the others to have other things in their life other than you, but a strong bond nonetheless. 

And, crucially, a bond that he couldn't be *above*. He was the Ponds' son-in-law, and River's husband. A family of equals, never mind that one's a time lord and one's an assassin and one was an auton.

That's what happened. That's why he broke down at losing his mother-in-law today, as opposed to quietly, gently saving his companion in The Big Bang. 

I can only imagine how much he must be hurting.

---

God. There's other stuff I wanted to talk about; ""one psychopath per TARDIS"" and Marriage chiefly, and also my suspicion that the new companion is regenerated!Jenny or otherwise related to the Doctor as well, and how much I appreciated a _good_ Angels episode after the stupid Byzantium angels, and how I'm not sure but I think the new time travel quirk actually does make sense... but I can't. I just can't, I'm sorry. This episode left me completely drained.

Moffat can be problematic, but when he delivers, he *delivers*. I am not at all sorry I watch this show.

true,spacemonkymafia,tardis,TARDIS,"Yes, but based on their general ages at the time of the episode and the age/date we know Rory dies, they were likely sent back to right about the turn of the century... and there's a fairly substantial war not too far off that could very well bring at least Rory back to England for a bit.

Of course, the timing is entirely off, Brian wouldn't have been born for several years after Rory's death... if we assume he still dies in 1938. Which may not apply anymore now that the Winter Quay is gone... hmm...

wibbly wobbly.

**edit:** It's been pointed out that Old Rory's death we witnessed in 1938 was a that of a Rory sent back in time *from* 1938, not from 2012, which is what ultimately happened. If we assume that Amy and Rory were sent back to 1938 (which makes sense considering ages), then, well, there's another substantial war looming on the horizon. Rory would be part of it, he'd pretty much have to be, not many men of fightin' age could avoid it unless they were medically incapable (and we know Rory isn't medically incapable of being involved in battle), and I can imagine Amy signing up for one of the women's military options available at the time (WASP, or WAC, a nurse perhaps?)",0,1348991001,null,0,1349024789,0,c6fgjv5,t3_10omez,t1_c6fgjv5,t1_c6fgbca,null,1430026393,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

First off, you need to check on the OS when the tickets are released for general sale. This is generally a week or so after season ticket holders can get their hands on them, but in my experience there are usually still plenty left by the time they go on general sale. 

Then just phone up the box office as early as possible on that date and ask if they have any tickets for that match. They'll ask you for a customer number, if you don't have one already you can get one by registering on the e-ticketing bit on the OS. Make sure you have a card handy for you to pay with, then they'll send out the tickets by first-class post, which usually arrive next day. Easy-peasy. 

I'm on my phone right now so can't post links and such, but if you need any more help just ask. This is the way I got my tickets for Swansea last week, so all the info is right up to date.

Now, in *execution*, I agree with you.  Rose's goodbye scenes have nothing on the graveyard scene in this one, in my opinion.

I think that they constantly play to their lowest common denominator and that results in a continual loss of support.  Keeping their followers in Sandy Row or the Shankill happy has cost and will continue costing them the support of those who 10-20yrs ago would have supported them.

They're of the apparent position that to be a unionist you have to be of some loyal order or more or less be what i'd call a 'knuckle dragger', yes, education is a big part of it.  But I'm not going to vote for people who associate with the BNP, their version of being British is at odds with mine.

And when i've said that there are a lot of reasonably educated prods who distance themselves from it, yes, I distance myself from it because I have slowly grown to despise everything this lot stand for.  I have many friends who are in the same boat who feel that they dont give a shit either way on the nationality debate, simply because they dont want to be associated with people like this.

Also, I dont think its too many miles away from the truth to say that while, 100 years ago the political issues were affecting all social classes, it has slowly eroded to the position where its only those who live in a 'community' who give a shit.  Those communities are generally the most deprived areas... why is that?  Is it that the more educated have decided they can live with their neighbours and they dont agree with how unionism/nationalism has behaved as past 100 years?

So what is the root of what i'm saying? 100 years ago, their cause was a reasonable one, all walks of life and social classes were involved... 100 years on, only the deprived and uneducated give enough of a shit to go marching  where they are not wanted and stirring up hatred wherever they can, evidenced by the fact that mr BNP was there.

""In its analysis of the poll results, IICMER noted that Romanians are far from alone in their generally positive evaluation of 20th Century communism. According to a survey carried out in several Central and East European countries in 2009 by the US-based Pew Research Center, the proportion of people in former socialist nations who take the view that life under capitalism is worse than it was during the period of communist power is as follows:

Poland: 35%

Czech Republic: 39%

Slovakia: 42%

Lithuania: 42%

Russia: 45%

Bulgaria: 62%

Ukraine: 62%

Hungary: 72%

Particulary significant in the results of the 2010 CSOP / IICMER poll in Romania is that, as they aquire more experience of life under the 'market economy' people are becoming more negative about capitalism and positive about communism. In the previous poll in 2006, 53% expressed a favourable opinion about communism; the 2010 survey showed that 61% are favourable towards communism.""

And, naturally we have generally received a heavily propagandised version of communist history here in the West, spun by our own capitalist myth-makers, those in the vanguard of the revolution who wanted to make claims to have achieved communism when clearly they had not, those on the right who led the drift back to capitalism and wished to create a revisionist history of what had gone before, and finally, from those various elites (academic, cultural, monied) who had lost many of their privileges, and often fled to and were lauded and feted in the West.

The angels seemed way too peaceful in this episode. The threat just wasn't there, there were loads of times when nobody was even looking at them, and nobody really had that terrified ""Holy fucking shit, do not take your eyes off that thing"" attitude, it was more like, just ""oh look, an angel."" 

The only time I felt any emotion about Amy and Rory was when they were on the rooftop, and Amy's letter. 

I don't know, maybe I'll like it when I watch more of season 7.  Perhaps I can appreciate the Ponds, and this episode, more when we see 11 without them for a change. This waiting is going to kill me though.

true,Naezwood,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'll admit, I was kindof like that when I first got into Doctor Who.  After the  10th Doctor regenerated I said ""there's no way Tennant can be as good as Eccleston.""  But I loved the show so I watched it anyway, and fell absolutely in love with Tennant.  

Then came Martha.  I loved her too.  She was intelligent, and miserably in love with The Doctor, and he just couldn't see it.

Then Donna Noble.  I dreaded that season.  I had seen Catherine Tate on The Office before ever watching Doctor Who and I hated her.  But Donna Noble really cut me deep.  Somebody who had never mattered before got to travel through time and space, and in the alt universe episode we find out she's essential to the universe's survival.  Then she had her mind wiped and could never remember just how important and special she was.  That season finale made me bawl like no other.  

""I don't want to go.""  Those words still bring me to tears.  I'm always going to miss Tennant, but I'm on my third Doctor now and I've learned that this show isn't about the actors, it's about the characters.  I was fed up with the Ponds, and then I watched tonight's episode and actually teared up for the characters I was so sick of. 

I don't consider myself a hardcore Whovian or anything, but if your co-worker won't watch anything other than Tennant she clearly doesn't understand what this show is about.  We're on our Eleventh Doctor, for god's sake.  One of Doctor Who's major themes is change.  The Doctor has to keep changing, and his companions have to leave.

&gt; THEROUX: Yeah. So why would you say that then?

&gt; SAVILE: Because we live in a very funny world. And it's easier for me, as a single man, to say ""I don't like children"" because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt.

&gt; THEROUX: Are you basically saying that so tabloids don't, you know, pursue this whole 'Is he/isn't he a paedophile?' line, basically?

&gt; SAVILE: Yes, yes, yes. Oh, aye. How do they know whether I am or not? How does anybody know whether I am? Nobody knows whether I am or not.

* Holt needs to play, even when he's not scoring he offers a hell of a lot more than any other striker to the team, I also think that he will start scoring, his finish yesterday was lovely.

* Either Fox or Johnson need to sit deeper (or both), whenever Norwich come up against someone who plays in the hole, the defence is horribly exposed.

* I would have stuck with Bennett and Pilkington as the wide men pretty much week in week out, as last season I thought it provided good balance. Butterfield, Hoolahan and Snodgrass can compete for the attacking midfield spot, Butterfield looks like a good footballer, he also offers a different option out wide.

* Bassong and Barnett can be a good partnership, I'm not convinced by Turner at all. I'm not Barnett's biggest fan, either, but think he's been okay alongside General Bass.

* Harry Kane hasn't started that well but I think once he adjusts to this level he can be a good option off the bench, he's got more guile than the other strikers and I would rather him than Morison, frankly, as I don't rate Morison at all.

* Jackson has started the season quite well but he doesn't offer anywhere near enough in terms of hold up play, he'll play his best footy in a 4-4-2 which is difficult for teams like Norwich to play whilst remaining competitive in the middle three.

Eg: Doctor and Brigadier last say goodbye when Brigadier is like what? 50?

And his visit there, could then change a fixed point.

As for your example, Rose didn't actually die, she just 'left'. So technically, her life is still in flux. Captain Jack visits her a couple of times too. 

&gt;I'm not really sure why knowing that Rory dies at age 82 means that the Doctor can't go get him for a while then makes sure he takes him back to die in New York at age 82.

If my assumptions are correct, it has to do with the interval. The Doctor taking him away from there, could drastically change when he dies and therefore the future = bye bye universe.

I mean there were additional scenes which didn't appear in the episode which I know were filmed so they're probably holding onto some secrets.

I still adored a lot of the elements and emotions of the story and if it had been like The Girl Who Waited or God Complex then it may have been a lot more reasonable but the ending bit...for me...just felt stuck on from something else. It didn't feel genuine. It felt like it had to be there for reasons of ""Don't think about it too much"". A lot of the plots in this series have been like ""Don't think about it too much"".

I loathed pretty much every plot (loved character moments) aside from perhaps Mercy. Each of them needed a full 60 to 90 minute treatment instead of these rush-jobs.

Has Moffat lost his mind since Mid-series 6? Has he lost touch with normal human reactions with how the Ponds shrugged off any chance of Melody in their life? Is he playing a long game with us?

- Amy and Rory are growing up and finding they prefer real life to life in the TARDIS
- Most importantly, Amy chose Rory.  The Doctor begged her to get back into the TARDIS and she refused because Rory came first.

""Good-bye, Raggedy Man"" wasn't just a farewell to The Doctor but a farewell to childish things, a farewell to the friend everyone told her she had imagined.  She broke the spell and, no matter how you try to cobble it back together, it would never be the same again. The Amy and Doctor relationship has always had an element of fairy-tale to it - think about him telling her to dream of their adventures in The Big Bang - and now it's ended.   That is why he won't go back to see them.  Once he read the afterword in the book and was told the Ponds were happy, he had basically been told that he wasn't wanted or needed by them anymore.

EDIT - It just occurred to me that, in thematically, it is very close to Drop Dead Fred.  The Doctor was the childish part of Amy that she clung on to until she just didn't need it anymore to make her happy.",0,1349002386,null,0,1349002914,0,c6fhk2e,t3_10pbnp,t1_c6fhk2e,t3_10pbnp,null,1430026868,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

As we saw, she writes it fairly soon after getting zapped back so there's plenty of her timeline that the Doctor could safely visit without any hint of complications relating to her writing the page or even being involved with the book. Just because she writes it thinking it's the last communication she'll ever have with him doesn't mean it has to be.

The tombstone: it's writing on a lump of rock. If the Doctor saw some graffiti saying ""Amy Williams, Died 1345"" it wouldn't mean equally little as the tombstone. Anybody could have put it there at any time for any reason so it's far from gospel, it's just the the usual reason for a tombstone being there is that said died. Even if they really are buried there and died in that year from the point of view of the general Earth timeline, it tells us nothing of where or, crucially, when they lived the rest of their lives. All they have to do is make sure that they die and are buried there, the rest of their lives are open to interpretation. This effect has been demonstrated already: we know they keep taking long trips (eg: 7 weeks in TPoT) and returning moments later back on modern day Earth, meaning that Amy and Rory's age is greater than what their birth records or even their friends' and family's memories would suggest.

You say that the tombstone isn't a pre-planned deception but how do we know that? It would be very easy for Rory and Amy to say ""Hey, all we need is for there to be a tombstone to see - nobody saw us die, nobody saw a body.""

Buying tickets from Chelsea

http://www.chelseafc.com/fullwidth-article/article/2441717

The bigger the game the harder tickets are to get. But you'll probably able to get some so don't worry about it (as long as you're on the ball). If you're not a member then remember that this is Chelsea's ticket policy:

&gt;
First week - Members only.

&gt;Second week - Members and season ticket holders can purchase two extra tickets.

&gt; Third week onwards - If any tickets remain, these go on general sale to non-members.

For those who need to know, here is how a standard cup of tea with milk should be made, abridged from the original:

&gt; Weigh, to an accuracy of ± 2 %, a mass of tea corresponding to 2 g of tea per 100 ml of liquor (i.e. 5,6 ± 0,1 g of tea for the large pot or 2,8 ± 0,05 g for the small pot described in the Annex) and
transfer it to the pot (5.1).

&gt; Fill the pot containing the tea with freshly boiling water) to within 4 to 6 mm of the brim (i.e. corresponding approximately to 285 ml in the case of the large pot and 140 ml in the case of the small pot described in the Annex) and put on the lid. Allow the tea to brew for 6 min, and then, holding the lid in place so that the infused leaf is held back, pour the liquid through the serrations into the bowl (5.2) corresponding to the pot selected. Remove and invert the lid, transfer the infused leaf to it and place the inverted lid on the empty pot to allow the infused leaf to be inspected. In the case of fine, powdery dust grades, special care should be taken and a sieve may be required.

&gt; Pour milk free from any off-flavour (for example raw milk or unboiled pasteurized milk) into the bowl (5.2), using approximately 5 ml for the large bowl and 2,5 ml for the small bowl described in the
Annex. Prepare the liquor as described in 7.2.1 but pour it
into the bowl after the milk, in order to avoid scalding the milk, unless this procedure is contrary to the normal practice in the organization
concerned. If the milk is added afterwards, experience has
shown that the best results are obtained when the
temperature of the liquor is in the range 65 to 80 °C when the milk is added. While addition of milk is not essential, it sometimes
helps to accentuate differences in flavour and colour.

Likewise, if the gravestone is there because Rory was zapped back and live for 60 more odd years before dying, and then he reads it, interacting with that bit of his future, that bit of his future is now unchangeable. It's not the words or his perception of the words, its that he interacted with a timeline where he was zapped back and died  after living that life. That whole chain of events has been validated.

It's not 100% there for us yet, but this was a good result in terms of confidence, points and positioning, especially with Manchester United losing in the evening.

Once that midfield 3 really clicks (I'd say it's about 70% there) we will be very difficult to live with.

Lampard on the bench was I think the right decision. We needed a higher tempo game at times, and although his mental speed is there, a pairing of he and Mikel just slows us down that bit too much. Ramires was a much better call.

Pleased for Torres. I was disappointed with his work rate last week, did not have that complaint today.

First he complains that the number of publicly traded companies has reduced dramatically, and then he complains that share-holders of publicly traded companies are free to sell their shares at any time. Well, he can't have it both ways. Does he want the shares easily traded or not?

The reason for all the short-termism at the moment is that no-one feels confident. Companies keep announcing profit warnings and everyone runs away. (Look at BRBY's share price recently.)

&gt; The stock market has descended into a casino, served by a vast industry of intermediaries – agents, trustees, investment managers, registrars and advisers of all sorts – who have grown fat from opaque fees.

I think this is closer to where the real trouble lies: the vast sums that can be earned just from being an intermediary to where the real profit is being earned. The big investment banks who started trading on their own account and banks which started inventing products which actually damaged their customers.

true,fquested,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"See, I find these discussions kind of annoying.  I like all the companions, because they each fulfil a different function.  Just covering the new who:
Rose: is moral and loving but innocent.  She needs to be protected and cherished while she heals the doctor from his trauma.  As she loses her innocence she becomes more of a helpmeet to the doctor.

Martha: Picks up where Rose left off and does more as a helper than could be expected of Rose.  The doctor is back to wanting to be challenged, which Martha occasionally does, but doesn't challenge him too much because he still needs to be loved to help him heal from the Time War.

Donna: Really challenges the doctor, without pulling punches.  Attacks his hubris a few times.  Makes him question if he really needs companions.

So the doctor goes companionless.  He comes close to taking on an amoral companion (Lady De Souza), but stops himself...because he needs the moral center that the companion provides.  Without it, he falls into Hubris in such a big way (Waters of Mars).

Which leads us to Amy who gives him the moral center in such a major way.  She is a true companion (yes, she'd bed him, but I don't think it would mean much to her, just a different way of sharing herself with him).

Again, that's not religion, that's science. Hypotheses and answers are never set in stone. We believe certain things about science, but these things change as we do more discoveries.

Take Mithras, the Persian god who gained cult-like status among many Romans by blood, or Sullis Minerva, a God who was a fusion between the Native British god and a Roman God. Moreover, the usage of Natives in the British Empire can be seen also in the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire had to employ barbarian mercenaries to continue to garuntee the safety of its borders. In a similiar way to the British Empire (Indian mutiny of 1857) the non-romans in the Roman Empire were not always loyal.

Thats not what the article is getting at anyway: it is about the political dangers of tearing up the social contract. 

To be more explicit: Greeks are currently having to go to foodbanks and charity clinics in massive numbers. When access to healthcare and food breaks down, its fair to say the post-war compromise is dying on its feet.

And for the reason you note, the creditors in this situation hold the power, Greeks have very little say in the matter, and no politician has the guts to admit that this is a *political* change, not just an economic one.

What goes mostly unsaid in that article is the political dangers of this are massive. In Greece the violence of the streets is spilling out into everyday life. Old spectres still haunt Europe: fascism, communism... they have not gone away.

People really get this wrong about Tucker (and it is something Peter Capaldi in interviews will often correct people on), yes he is self interested to a certain extent and clearly likes power, often mean and arguably amoral in his machinations but not evil, he's not even necessarily a bad person.

However he does it for the good of the party, he does seem to genuinely believe he is doing, if not the right thing, either what needs to be done or what the party wants done (the SEN schools ep and In the Loop and a couple of other episodes so on show you examples where he is clearly not happy with what he is being forced to push) and that they are better in power than the other lot. 

He simply believes the ends justify the means.

Last night's episode showed you he can be heartless and even simply nasty in his scheming (although you get the impression with 2 years of Nicola Murray at the helm of the party you'd be pretty justified in hating her) but he clearly did the right thing by getting rid of someone who was electoral suicide and digging the party into a ditch and another person who was both useless and trying for a naked power grab.

When Rory sees the gravestone the problem isn't that he's reading his gravestone. It's that he's interacted with a timeline where he was zapped to the past and died of old age in New York. For his timeline to work that has to happen. Changing it = paradox.



In the same way, the Doctor reading about Amy's final farewell in the book means that his timeline now incorporates Amy saying farewell to him for the last time in the graveyard. The Doctor's personal timeline now incorporates Amy going back in time to be with Rory and saying goodbye for the last time in the graveyard. He can't change it or it breaks his own timeline.



This is the same reason the Doctor seeing himself dying didn't mean he had to die: because perception isn't the deciding factor, it's the interaction of timelines.

The chapter being titled 'Amelia's last fairwell', to me at least, does not lock that event. He didn't read the chapter itself, just the heading, so no specifics have been revealed. All he knows is that the book has a chapter called that, it's a hint at what could be a far more complicated reality. In the case of River's wrist, Amy actually read about the event so that was entirely inescapable, even then the Doctor made a slight edit in that he didn't break it, he just made the decision not to take the other course of action which, you could argue, was influenced by his prior knowledge. That said, he was probably just accepting the inevitability of it and getting it done a fast as possible.

The event that is unchangeable for Rory is, at worst, that he must die in that year and that location. What is completely open is what he does in the mean time. He could, either with the Doctor or with a Vortex Manipulator or any other means travel absolutely anywhere to actually live out the rest of his life. All he has to do is return to die. That is the ONLY fixed point for Rory, we don't even have a set cause of death as his death at Winter Quay happened in a timeline that no longer exists. Amy is a little less flexible: she has a book to publish, but after that everything is open right up until her death at that time and place. Just because the destination is fixed does not mean that the journey is set in stone - the Doctor's big farewell tour before lake Silencio proves this.

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"This piece is a bit of a mess. It doesn't seem to me to have any unifying theme beyond wanting hugely increased controls over companies. 

&gt;Their [British Companies] competitors in other countries, with different ownership structures and incentives, have survived and prospered.

This is nonsense. Some companies in Germany and the US have indeed prospered. Others have collapsed. This is identical to the situation in the UK and everywhere. 
 
&gt;The stock market has descended into a casino, served by a vast industry of intermediaries – agents, trustees, investment managers, registrars and advisers of all sorts – who have grown fat from opaque fees.

When has the market ever been anything other than a means of making investors money? That's the attraction for them. No small shareholder buys shares because they really want to say how a Peruvian Mining Company is run. They do it (and always have) because they hope to make a profit. Businesses continue to sell shares on the open market because profit-seeking investors will provide them with much needed capital. 

The list of 'bad people' he lists exist because the market will bear them. Their fees are not opaque - they are fees for a service they provide. If people didn't want the service, these people would soon be out of work.

&gt;Any shareholder – from a transient day trader to a long-term investor – has the same standing in law.

Only if the company wants them to. It would be perfectly possible for the company to sell long-term investors a different class of shares with better voting rights and so on. Indeed, some do.

&gt;Incorporation was understood to be associated with obligations: a company had to declare its purpose before earning a licence to trade. There existed a mutual deal between society and company.

There's a very good reason that the requirement to state a company purpose was removed. When company purposes were required, the company could only act towards that purpose. But the boundaries of that were never clear. I set up a company for the purposes of buying and selling lumber. I then decide to buy a sawmill. Is that outside the company's purpose? Better get the lawyers in.

By encountering the grave he's locked in. The whole life from being zapped back and dying alone is now locked in as an event. If that whole life never happened he would not have seen the grave. Interacting with that grave in any meaningful capacity locked in every event that led up to that grave being there. The Doctor and Amy are, sadly, now part of said timeline as well. 



For the book to be written as it was, for it to have 'The Last Farewell' chapter and an afterword by Amy, she had to have been zapped back in time and said goodbye to him one last time. Otherwise, no afterword or sad final chapter necessary. At the start there was always going to be a book, but that was always fixed. Once he read that final chapter title he interacted with a timeline where all of those events happened. The words might not necessarily say for sure Amy says goodbye to the Doctor, but they were written in a timeline where she did, and so by reading it he locks in that timeline. 



The Doctor on Lake Silencio is a timeline that DOES allow for exploration. As far as we've seen, the Amy timeline requires her to say goodbye at the graveyard and then write a heartfelt afterword because she'll never see him again. The chapter title and afterword would be unnecessary if he ever saw her again. Non-Doctor timeline locked in.



Now, we can say that maybe Amy wrote the last farewell and afterword as some sort of insane timey wimey deception to escape her fate, or she wrote the afterword THINKING she'd never see him again, say in 1954, but then he arrives in 1962.

If you think about it, the book.... it just showed up in his jacket. And the doctor mentions something like this, that things just show up. 
so you can either believe that the TARDIS is doing some stuff, you know, getting the doctor to where he is supposed to be, like Idris told him in ""The Doctors Wife"", or it is someone,

(super crazy theory ahead) 

that is living in the TARDIS, like Clara, who is this super genious hacker and whom the Doctor finds in the most unlikely pace ever according to some info... (The exact quote is “The Doctor is going to meet someone very new in the very last place he could ever have expected…”, it is on DWTv's series summmary at Episode  6 [Doctor Who TV ""What we know""](http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-series-7-2012-what-we-know-27371.htm) 

And she puts the book in his jacket because she hacked some database where all this info about the doctor is stored, possibly by the Silence, and and she knows it is importand the doctor finds the book, 

and then she somehow builds a tracker that finds the tardis and then she gets in because the tardis knows she has to be there and that is exactly how it has to be

and we are not getting so many tardis scenes because the Moff didn't want to spoil where the Doctor will find her... and then Clara gets captured by the Daleks, and meets him in the Asylum, and she tells him her name is Oswin Oswald (as a reference to friend of God) not Clara Oswald because she knew that if she did it would create a paradox and that she worked on this Cruiseship because the Doctor and her were there because there was some wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff going on and they got seperated and...


TL; DR the book was put in jacket by Oswin who lives in the TARDIS.

One: Back room deals would have been more prominent with AV, there’s nothing democratic about that. If anything it’s extremely undemocratic.

Two: Which is another good point, one equal vote for everyone in the country, surely that’s the definition of democracy?

Six: Do agree with you on that one

Seven: Let’s be honest, tactical voting would be 10xs worse under AV. Whether that’s a valid point though is debatable.

Ten: Another point I agree with. If you only have one vote you’re going to vote for the person you think will do the best job. The vast majority of people are just going to blindly pick after option 3 or 4, giving votes to people who could be completely retarded for all the voter knows.

These aren’t really mainstream articles though are they? How many people who aren’t interested in politics would look at them? Mainstream outlets on both sides did a pretty poor job of representing each side imo, especially The Mail and The Guardian.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Right, trying to be as brief as possible without writing a novel.

Starting 1955, ITV is established as a federal system of franchised companies, each franchised to serve the local needs of different areas and, in some regions, different times (for example, Rediffusion were contracted to run London's weekday ITV, while Granada were (and essentially still are) contracted to run weekday ITV in the north of England). The ITA, and later on (after 1972) the IBA - Independent Broadcasting Authority - are constituted to oversee this system.

The ITA and IBA are incredibly robust regulation-wise. The IBA assumes the role of broadcaster for ITV, with the individual companies (numbering about 15) each contracted to them to provide programmes for their respective areas. This means that the IBA has large amounts of power and sets quality bars for each of the contractors. Each has public-service broadcasting targets and responsibilities to their viewers, such as the provision of local programming and (for the larger companies) the production of quality programming for the ITV network as a whole. The two regulators are not afraid to monkey around in the mechanics of this system - for example, during the 1968 franchise round, where the contracts for running each ITV region were effectively put out to tender (although there wasn't really a *tender* as such... yet - there was no bidding, just a statement of what each company would promise to do in its respective region, but I digress), the ITA essentially forced ABC Weekend Television and Rediffusion into a merger, forming Thames Television. It could arguably be said that, given Thames' enduring contribution to television programming, this was a wise move on their part. But, again, I digress.

Fast forward to 1990. The Conservative government views ITV as being over-regulated. So the Broadcasting Act is past. The IBA is demised and replaced by the ITC - Independent Television Commission. With this, another franchise round takes place, only this time with a crucial difference. Rather than each company's programming and public service aspirations being the sole judge of whether they will get to retain (or attain) the franchise for a region, the ITC also solicited cash bids, in addition to the programming plans. Some contractors, knowing they had no opponents, lowballed their bids - Central Independent Television for the Midlands bid the pissy sum of £2,000 (no typo - two thousand pounds, total, a year to run ITV for a large part of the country) - while others, such as TVS and TSW, bid such ridiculously unsustainable amounts of money that the ITC had to turn them down flat because they thought both companies would collapse as soon as their new licenses started.

The flaws in this process, and the change from the regulator's concern being for the viewer as it was under the IBA, is exemplified with the demise of Thames. Thames produced some of the best-loved, and most internationally successful, programming on the ITV network. They lost their bid to Carlton Television, a company whose stated plan was to not make any programmes whatsoever themselves, because their bid was lower, and were told that they could not use their long and successful history in television as an overriding factor. Bye bye Thames. Hello Carlton.

We're speaking with hindsight here. But suffice to say, Carlton's net contribution to British television has been worth absolutely fuck all. Compared to Thames' legendary output, it isn't even worth a derisory snort. And it was foreseeable - they outright told the regulator they would contract out all of their programme making. But they bid more money, so they won. So here we have the deregulation of ITV already negatively impacting viewers. This was not helped by the ITC not being the overall broadcaster any more; rather than the regulator being the broadcaster, each individual contractor was now a ""broadcaster in its own right"". Which meant what was the IBA's power to set quality bars and to enforce public-service remits upon the ITV companies was drastically weakened, and eventually removed entirely.

Then it got worse. Another relaxed regulation was that surrounding ITV companies purchasing each other or merging. They did so with gusto. In 1994, Carlton purchased Central. In 1996, they bought Westcountry television too (Westcountry also being another company who contracted out all their programming, taking over from the far more locally-rooted TSW) and later acquired HTV in Wales and western England. Granada went on their own spending spree, buying up five other franchises. Scottish Television bought their neighbour to the North, Grampian, consolidating further. What used to be 15 companies competing against each other to produce television the best they can was now five. Then, in 2002, Carlton and Granada merged to form ITV plc, which then bought Channel Television. The fifteen companies were now three (ITV plc, UTV and STV).

It got worse. Continuity announcers and other staff up and down the country were sacked as the new consolidated ITV streamlined its operations. Whereas each ITV contractor used to have its own announcers, its own transmission departments, its own presentation teams, all of the above are now amalgamated in Leeds. There's some concrete job losses for you, right there.

It got worse. The regulator was now Ofcom, and they amazingly managed to deregulate further, giving the nod to ITV reducing its public-service commitments - may I remind you, partly what the companies were actually contracted to provide - by merging regions into each other, reducing the number of news studios (and local news services) and finally dispensing with any idea of a public service commitment. I can't think of an example of any other regulator so carelessly disposing of one of its own stated responsibilities in so reckless a way. This arrangement is now here to stay, also; there has not been an ITV franchise round in over 20 years. Previously? 10 years' distance between them. Through lax regulation, a single company has effectively assumed control of a large part of our broadcast spectrum, and our media landscape, and cannot be shifted.

Now take a look at ITV as it is now, with the endless stream of TOWIE and bullshit, the reduced local service, the ""television in bulk"" pumped out from Leeds, then take a look at what Thames and TVS and Yorkshire were putting out in the 1970s and 80s, at documentaries like The World At War - a magnificent series broadcast and made by Thames, which would never even come close to being greenlit by ITV plc today - and please tell me again that deregulation of broadcasting is a good idea?

Firstly, there's what the Doctor said about the graveyard in 2012 and 1938 being ""causally linked"" when they bounce off of 1938 and end up in the present day. So there's that link which would could very well work vice versa.

Secondly, the nature of the ""Winter Quay Angels"" is to ""farm"" people by sending them back to the same time and place over and over again. It's why Rory was only moved in space when he was taken by a cherub in the basement; he was already in the right time. Therefore, it can be guessed that the survivor in the graveyard is still automated to farm and send them back to the same time. These Angels seemed much more organised — the Doctor compares their farming operation to the one-off, hit of the Blink-style Angels — than the ones in Blink that were more random (although the fact that Billy Shipton was sent back to the same time as the Doctor and Martha probably wasn't a coincidence).",0,1349015386,null,0,1349016036,0,c6fiucg,t3_10otig,t1_c6fiucg,t1_c6ffdo7,null,1430027473,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,mistyriver,null,null,"&gt; When did Rory stop being made of plastic?

He waited 2000 years in something of a parallel world - kind of like the one that Rose got stuck in. With the Tardis exploding, it took out all of space and time, as you remember, with the explosion itself becoming the earth's sun. When the Doctor stopped the Tardis explosion, that parallel world caused by that disaster ceased to exist. Therefore Rory is back to being Rory, the ordinary nurse from Leadworth - and the other place is like a dream to him. 

It's similar to how in this episode, he dies falling off the building, but doesn't actually, because the ""paradox"" created by his death destroys the Weeping Angels' project there in New York City.

&gt; Another thing, were they literally stuck inside their rooms in winters quay? How did they get food and what not? Also wouldn't they have tried to escape when the doctor was doing any of his shenanigans?

Plot elements that don't get developed in Doctor Who don't always make sense. If you look closely, you'll find logical errors... in the same way if you look closely at a theater set you'll see it's all hacked together out of odds and ends. Furthermore, one must remember that each episode in Doctor Who is written by a different writer... so whereas there is an attempt to draw together ongoing themes and work on them, there often isn't a good sense of continuity across episodes and seasons.

There was a big use of the idea of a ""fixed point in time"" in this episode. This is kind of a trump card that Doctor Who writers can use in order to give permanence to a thread of  plot development, in a world where otherwise the Doctor could go anywhere, and do anything, and change anything. The idea is that they had just witnessed an old man Rory dying in his bedroom, and because they had seen it in person, that event was thought to have become a ""fixed point in time."" If you're interested in this concept, there's a good [episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day_\(Doctor_Who\)) where Rose saves her father (who in real life had died before she was born) from dying and by doing so ""rips a hole in the fabric of space and time.""

Remember that Melody was found to be in the USA in the 1900s after she had been abducted. My personal pet theory is that the Ponds will be given the chance to raise their daughter, now that they've been forced to live out the rest of their lives in that timeframe. Certainly, everyday life in 21st century London was putting a strain on their marriage.

I've been watching the new ""[Leonardo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_\(TV_series\))"" BBC episodes... and mentally comparing the writing style to Doctor Who. Leonardo is much tighter and more coherent with a lot more emotional continuity between episodes and even seasons. Character development and arcs are given more thorough treatment.

Doctor Who has never been written in that way. I think Moffat may have been the one of the first lead directors to try to give some long term cohesion to the series, but he's somewhat hamstrung by the hodgepodge way Doctor Who has always been produced.

&gt; It didn't feel genuine. It felt like it had to be there for reasons of ""Don't think about it too much"". A lot of the plots in this series have been like ""Don't think about it too much"".

My feeling was that this Moffat episode may have been written twice, with the alternate ending added as an afterthought, perhaps because Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill suddenly wanted to move on to a new project.",0,1349016827,null,0,1349018267,0,c6fj2qc,t3_10oeg4,t1_c6fj2qc,t1_c6fhjsa,null,1430027582,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I passionately loved this episode because of all the deep hints about the writing process, and the sense of continuity with the past and future Moffat timeline, and the use of a creative plot element of a novel which actually comes to life. 

I didn't much care for Moffat's ""Asylum of the Daleks"" - it seemed to be hastily written - although I thought it was a cool and innovative idea to have the woman who thought she was a human actually find out she was a Dalek (my pet theory is that was the ""Doctor's Daughter"" from series 4). 

I certainly loathed Chibnall's ""Dinosaurs on a spaceship,"" because it seemed to be only a collection of clichés all jumbled together. On the other hand, I thought Chibnall did really well with ""The Power of three.""

I think there's not a whole lot of point to getting hung up, hoping that hold Doctor Who will keep itself to a solid sense of logical consistency. It's a playful show.
