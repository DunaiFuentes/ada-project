Allows ask for identification.

Never agree to anything they say or give your name, in doing so you enter a statutory contract. 

Without entering a statutory contract they can only use common law, which means they have to have a warrant and the legal right to arrest you.

Always ask on video what is going down, explain to them you study law and will hold them accountable if they fail to act accordingly and ask what law, not statue this falls under. 

If they ask for anything e.g entry, name, stop filiming ect, say am I legally obliged to and under what law, not statute. 

Sure there's more, but its pretty shocking when you research how the system works try this

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"Well interestingly enough, back in 1979, that was exactly the plan. Allow people who lived in a council house to get onto the property ladder without giving up the home they'd be living in for years, and use that money to build new social housing.

One provision was that local authorities had to use the revenue from council house sales to reduce their debts before new homes could be built. But the Labour opposition also tabled an amendment to the legislation on the basis that National Government couldn't force local governments to spend the revenue in a particular way. Thus allowing councils to spend most of the revenue on areas other than providing new social housing.

Also, the right to buy existed before 1980, and was actually first proposed by Labour, not the Conservatives.

&gt;Individual local authorities have always had the ability to sell council houses to their tenants, but until the early 1970s such sales were extremely rare. The Labour Party initially proposed the idea of a tenant's right to own the house they live in, in their manifesto for the 1959 General Election which they subsequently lost.

"" However, the Taylor Report stated that the official cause of the disaster was the failure of police control."" ""The disaster happened because most of the fans entering the terraces headed for the central pens 3 and 4 as directed by the large notice pointing them that way above the tunnel. Normally a police officer or steward would direct fans away from full pens, but on that day this did not happen. There were no stewards in that area at all. The official capacity of these pens was around 2,000, but the Health and Safety Executive later found that this should have been reduced to around 1,600 as the crush barriers did not conform to the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people were in these pens shortly after kick off at 3:00 pm. "" In summary - there were not too many people in the stadium so the lies about fans pushing in without tickets is unsubstantiated and always has been, there was more than adequate room within the whole terrace, but due to the fencing and lack of stewards and police who knew nothing all the fans went into a single pen, once they went down that tunnel (where they could not see what was ahead of them before entering the tunnel) they could not turn back. If the stewards or police were doing their jobs it would not have happened.  Also as for the ground this kind of thing wasn't entirely unknown to them or the FA as crushing occured in 1981, and again in 1985 where people were crushed at the same stadium.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; If someone were to put up a series of adverts on buses saying ""Christians are delusional"", then there'd be an absolute uproar and it'd inevitably be taken down.

well this effectively happened - the ""there's probably no God, now stop worrying and enjoy your life"" ad. That is akin to saying ""christian's are delusional"", but it went ahead, and whilst I'm sure there were complaints, the advert stood.

I actually think a ""Christians are delusional"" ad campaign would not be taken down. I see no reason why it should. I don't like it and I think it would be offensive, but it should be allowed. I don't think the major would block it. It may be forced to be abandoned if christians put enough pressure on the bus companies or something, but I doubt a top-down intervention would happen. 

For the record I wouldn't disagree with groups applying pressure to bus companies or advertisers or whatever, that is their right and if the companies buckle so be it. What I object to here is an intervention, or the idea that the government can tell us which ideas are offensive or derogatory and which are not. 

Also, these adverts seem more to imply homosexuality is a choice/lifestyle rather than an illness (which is what the group believes as I understand it).

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"well I don't mean to be a dick about it, I just think free speech is probably the most important part of a free society. 

Like - personally speaking -  I'm pretty happy that certain Muslim preachers are banned from saying things like ""Jews are responsible for all the world's problems"" or ""the holocaust never happened"". I don't want to hear that, I'm happy they are kept quiet. 

But honestly, I think I would rather they be *allowed* to say that stuff, than the government be making rulings and judgements all the time about what citizens can say. 

It seems pretty cushty now - the govt bans the crazies and all of us in the middle go happily onwards. But what if it became 'crazy' or offensive or derogatory for me to say ""City fans are fucking scum"" or ""Global warming is a lie""? It's not inconceivable. Give *any* government the power over free speech and there really is no limit to where it could end. 

So yeah, I'm kind of torn too, but I just don't like the way some of this is heading. I'm not one of those crazy ""big brother is watching you"" nutjobs. I would just rather people said what they want, and *society* can ostracise them or ignore them or campaign against them, rather than the government saying ""you can't say that"".

Equality is different than dissolution. The possibility for a strong organisation of dominions or an effectual commonwealth was never supported, neigh, was strongly opposed by the United States. They recognised full well that the British Empire was one of their most powerful opponents in the world, and were happy to dismantle it rapidly.

&gt;Your history is broken. The US largely stayed out of it. It was a British, French and Israeli affair. Their lessons have been learned too, history shows.

I'm sorry that no, my history is spot on, and yours is quite clearly lacking if you think that the US largely stayed out of the Suez Crisis. The US determined the course of events in Suez by threatening to completely collapse Sterling. They threatened to collapse our economy because we acted independently of them. This was the day they cut our balls off and hung them in the white house.  I don't see why everyone is fond of yanks and their foreign policy, it's as self serving as modern day China and just as passive or outright aggressive, if not more.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;Equality is different than dissolution. The possibility for a strong organisation of dominions or an effectual commonwealth was never supported, neigh, was strongly opposed by the United States. 

Whelp, the EEC and all the rest must have been a fly in the ointment then.  Makes no difference, the Commonwealth surged, strongly opposed or not.

&gt;They recognised full well that the British Empire was one of their most powerful opponents in the world, and were happy to dismantle it rapidly.

There was no 'They', the fabric of the Commonwealth was already there.  The key nations had already enacted it before the US even had chance to get their teeth stuck in.  There is no 'they'.

&gt;The US determined the course of events in Suez by threatening to completely collapse Sterling. They threatened to collapse our economy because we acted independently of them.

Codswallop; we called the shots in Iran in the 50s, we didn't get involved in Vietnam, we ran our own war next door and won in the same time, we ignored them with the Falklands, we called the shots and pulled them into Yugoslavia (rightly so).  The whole puppet thing is Blair-Blair-Blair.

&gt; I don't see why everyone is fond of yanks and their foreign policy, 

Because culturally we're very similar and as people they're lovely.  Policy wise we understand that we can differentiate and that they aren't their government.  Maybe it's a slim sliver-pool, but all the 'Yanks' that cross the Atlantic that I've met have been a collection of dudes and dudettes.  They laugh at my accent, and more than that my mannerisms and sayings, but they huggably love it at the same time. 

 They even prefer it when I'm grumpy in 'English-mode'.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Whelp, the EEC and all the rest must have been a fly in the ointment then.

The EEC and now EU have nothing on what the commonwealth could have been, what the empire could have been, and what the empire was. The US didn't oppose a trade organisation because it wasn't a threat to them, the British Empire was.

&gt;There was no 'They', the fabric of the Commonwealth was already there. The key nations had already enacted it before the US even had chance to get their teeth stuck in. There is no 'they'.

Just because the white nations had been granted dominion status and the king/emperor met once a year didn't mean that the commonwealth as it turned out was ever set in stone, nor even was the dissolution of the empire. The US intentionally rose on the backs of the British Empire and to an intellectual extent the German Reich.

&gt;Codswallop; we called the shots in Iran in the 50s, we didn't get involved in Vietnam, we ran our own war next door and won in the same time, we ignored them with the Falklands, we called the shots and pulled them into Yugoslavia (rightly so). The whole puppet thing is Blair-Blair-Blair.

The CIA lead Iran, not us. We didn't get involved in Iran, but did we have a say in whether it happened? Aye right. We did get involved in Suez, and the Americans said to leave or they'd collapse our economy, and so we did. Did we interfere when they decided to invade countries that nationalised their stuff? Of course not, we had no reason to. They had one reason and one reason alone to interfere there, and that was to finish the job they'd been working on for 50 years - the destruction of the UK as a world power.

I'm not saying we were their puppet, I am saying we treated them as an ally and they treated us as a potential adversary and someone to hasten the decline of - which they most certainly did.

&gt;Because culturally we're very similar and as people they're lovely.

As a people they're lovely, as a culture they're not really that similar.

&gt;Avon and Somerset Police received reports of a loud bang in various locations in the Force area at about 6.15pm on Thursday April 12.

&gt;It is believed that this was from a sonic boom from jet aircraft passing over the area. The Jets were responding to reports of a Civilian Helicopter that had a faulty transponder; the helicopter completed its journey and landed safe and well outside the Force area with no issues.

&gt;An MOD spokesman said: ""We can confirm that a small civilian aircraft was transmitting inadvertently on an emergency frequency at approximately 6.10pm. Two typhoons Jets from the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) responded accordingly and authorisation was given from them to go supersonic which resulted in the sonic boom. There was no actual threat to the civilian aircraft and they soon rectified their mistake.""

&gt;The QRA are based at RAF Conningsby in Lincolnshire.

&gt;No further information will be released on this tonight.

It's so obvious that the away record thing is just a sop, though.  I think what he's trying to do really, is somehow put the blame onto West Ham fans themselves, in a sneaky kind of way.  Like this idea that because we weren't all 100% behind his reputation, style, history and signings we've caused the players to be crap at home.

Fair enough, the atmosphere seems to be dogshit (haven't been this year).  But there's been endless crap for so long...years I mean. Surely it's positive play and big performances that should be the thing to break us out of the doldrums.

Why should we be overjoyed at season after season of frustration?

I'm always hesitant to accuse a manager with the old 'tactical limitations' tag, because I think they must know more than me.  But for fuck's sake, there were games there we could have bloody won, but the decisions weren't made that way, and then we're told to 'respect the point'.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;The EEC and now EU have nothing on what the commonwealth could have been,

Actually, not only is it the precursor, in many ways it shows the way it should be and it is just as relevant today.

&gt;Just because the white nations had been granted dominion status and the king/emperor met once a year didn't mean that the commonwealth as it turned out was ever set in stone

It meant it was set in law in 1931, and the law was followed, which is as set as stone as you can hope...

&gt;The CIA lead Iran, not us. We didn't get involved in Iran,

Wanna check your history there bud.  Britain was at the forefront.  BP before it was privatised was the owner.  Britain was there before the Yanks!  

&gt; Did we interfere when they decided to invade countries that nationalised their stuff?

Chile!

&gt;They had one reason and one reason alone to interfere there, and that was to finish the job they'd been working on for 50 years - the destruction of the UK as a world power.

You wanna check the businesses that took over after the 1812 war.  You wanna check out what the US said to the breaking of the Monroe Doctrine.

&gt;the destruction of the UK as a world power.

Still a seat on the UNSC so I guess the UN wins that one...

&gt;The US didn't oppose a trade organisation because it wasn't a threat to them, the British Empire was.

And that is begging the question that the Empire failed because of it.  a logical no go because the question has been raised that it didn't fail: so a straw man in the purest sense.

&gt;I'm not saying we were their puppet, I am saying we treated them as an ally and they treated us as a potential adversary and someone to hasten the decline of - which they most certainly did.

Your history is broken.  Britain has as much a history of pulling on US reigns (not saying with total control) as Israel in the 80s,90s, and 20s.



That's looking only at the latter half of the Blair premiership and nothing else.   Thatcher lead.  Major controlled.  Blair in his first term led with Clinton.   Blair went poodle under Bush.  Obama moved politically more to a neutral zone and Cameron has done nothing so far.

&gt;As a people they're lovely, as a culture they're not really that similar.

I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over the language, the music, the movie awards...politically we're different.  Meet the people; we're natural friends and lovies!

&gt;Agreed, I talk of US government and foreign policy here, sorry I should have been clearer up there. I don't mean individual joe bloggs on the street obviously :).

Fair Enough!

But you can't confuse culture with politics.  Culturally seven foreign nations of several nations walk into a bar: all things equal, you have more in common with the Yank, and the Yank knows more where you are coming from.  Culturally you are compliant with the American.   There's enough play hating on them.

Modric is perhaps the only player he was responsible for bringing in who really settled right away, and even then he had a short bedding in period when he had to become accustomed to the physicality of the Premier League.

It was also supposedly Comolli who mooted bringing Juandes Ramos to the club as manager, and that didn't end too well either. So I think, on the whole, most Spurs fans weren't too sad to see the back of him. The one thing that can be said in his favour is that several of his signings have blossomed at Spurs since his departure, so I expect Liverpool will be hoping for much the same thing!",0,1334267289,null,0,false,0,c4bk62s,t3_s6jom,t1_c4bk62s,t3_s6jom,null,1428709001,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"You're essentially asking me two questions: How well do you know the future, and how well can you read Roman's mind?

In seriousness, I suppose my answers would be as follows:

&gt; Who do you want to take charge?

Ideally? Carlo would come back, he was the first coach since Jose to be unfairly fired, and the one that was treated the most unfair, even worse than Jose. He made our offense purr, and our defense was irontight. He made a few confusing substitutions, there were complaints about his inflexible tactics, but he gleamed a hell of a lot of an aging squad that many gave zero chance of winning anything. I think if he had the Torres in the form he's in this season, he could have saved Carlo's job.

There's about 0% chance of that happening, so I would actually be okay with RDM staying on. We all know the influence of the Old Guard, and I for one am in favor of their stay. They look after the club well and are still capable of putting in great games. I think the reason we've stayed so strong despite the coaching carousel is down to them. Until their time has passed, keep a coach who manages men well, makes sound decisions and has the respect of the room. RDM is that. We sell a couple of players, we bring in a couple of new ones and promote a few, overall keep the same spine and the same coach. I think we'll be fine, but someone needs to figure out why the hell we keep conceding in the 80' minute.

&gt; Who will take charge?

Too many decisive games remain in our season - I think RDM has a legitimate chance still. Assume the best, and he stays. Assume the worst and we'll have a new manager next season. Guardiola is unlikely - it's either Barca or a sabbatical for him. Jose unlikely too - I don't see how he could return to Chelsea, but crazier things have happened. Zola maybe? The rumours are starting. I'd love to see him around these parts again but I really do not want his image tarnished - he's too good for it. For his sake I don't want him to be it. Didier Deschamps and Laurent Blanc are both being sounded out...I can go on for a while. I think Deschamps may prove to have the proper qualifications. He was Roman's second choice before he hired Jose after all. 

&gt; Who is the outside candidate you think has a good chance?

Dortmund's Jürgen Klopp. He's done fantastic work there. Dortmund are looking more and more like a big club that's here to stay though, and Germans don't often leave Germany, so I'd imagine it's unlikely on his part, but I think Roman would be wise to give him a serious sounding out.",0,1334269625,null,0,true,0,c4bknpy,t3_s6aum,t1_c4bknpy,t1_c4bk3m9,null,1428709245,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

These ads by the Anglican mainstream have the message that if you think you're gay, you can get ""treatment"" and change that (don't see any other meaning for ""ex-gay, post gay""). That's not a factual statement but actually a very misleading statement that is not backed by scientific evidence. On that basis they should have refused it for false advertising.

Personally I thought that this was pretty great. Gervais answered the critics who accused Life's Too Short of having no heart by handling this delicatly and with alot of genuine care. Carl also worked in his role, which while not that different from Carl's actual personality didn't undo the whole show with a poor performance.

The flaws were an uneven tone, which is probably owing to the fact that it was cut down from a much longer pilot (some say he filmed two hours, others claim just an hour), and the fact that Gervais is unsure if we're laughing at him or sympathising with him.

I would like to see a whole series however.

I don't know how credible that is, but if it's possible to develop sexual attraction for members of the same gender, why couldn't it go the other way? 

As far as I can tell, there's very little research explicitly addressing this -so I'd be grateful if anyone could point me to the relevant research.

That's my point. There is limited scientific info on this and it's inconclusive. Aside from the paper you mentioned (which I'm not going to pretend I've read but I'll just take your word on what it says) you mention anecdotal evidence, not scientific evidence. Anecdotal evidence doesn't cut it if you're trying to make factual statements (which is what this ad is). 

However, I do know for a fact that a sizeable chunk of the world's population are certain they are gay and have been gay for their whole life. This is something that has existed throughout human history and can be influenced by but is not eliminated by geography, culture, upbringing or any other factors. 

I also know for a fact that the scientific community acknowledges homosexuality and is, at best, sceptical of the ability to ""treat"" homosexuality. 

I do think still think their claim that ""ex-gay"" or ""post-gay"" people are ""proudly"" cured is unsubstantiated and misleading. It's not enough to point to anecdotal evidence to support because it's just as easily countered by any anecdotal evidence that goes against it.

true,widgetas,null,null,"The [Atheist Bus Campaign](http://www.atheistbus.org.uk/) (eventually) had the slogan: ""THERE'S PROBABLY NO GOD. NOW STOP WORRYING AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE.""

That doesn't cite any specific group, religion or individual, rather it was an appeal to anyone who might be worried about hell fire, damnation or being judged by an omnipotent being to reconsider the possibility. It attacked no-one, no group and didn't call for, for example, people to rally against those who *do* claim there's a god(s).

This bus campaign is in response to the Stonewall: [""Some people are gay. Get over it.""](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/quick_links/education_resources/4007.asp) campaign that was raising awareness that homophobia is still rife in the UK, and also called on people to accept that homosexuals are normal, natural and aren't going anywhere: a chastisement on their intolerance.

This group copied the Stonewall slogan, colouring and style: ""Not gay! Post-gay, ex-gay and proud. Get over it!"", which to a degree implies that those who (they claim) have been 'cured' of being gay are somehow being marginalised in the same way homosexuals are - as though those who oppose the 'gay cure' are somehow oppressing a minority. It also states that there are people who are ""ex-gay"" as though it is a verifiable fact (though the ASA doesn't pick up on this so perhaps they don't deem it an issue), which only fringe groups (oddly enough usually associated with a religion) believe is possible.

To sum it up: This advert was aiming to promote a 'cure' for homosexuality, as though it is a disease or an illness, made in a climate where gays are still discriminated against daily in the UK.    
The Atheist Bus Campaign was promoting the notion of living a life free from the worry of whether or not a deity exists.

true,dead_reckoner,null,null,"&gt;Aside from the paper you mentioned (which I'm not going to pretend I've read but I'll just take your word on what it says) you mention anecdotal evidence, not scientific evidence. Anecdotal evidence doesn't cut it if you're trying to make factual statements (which is what this ad is).

I never said that. The anecdotal evidence I referred to is the gay bloke I know who's straight now.

&gt;However, I do know for a fact that a sizeable chunk of the world's population are certain they are gay and have been gay for their whole life. 

That hardly counts as conclusive, though. Like I mentioned, there are several accounts of people who *turned gay* late in life. How then, is it not possible for a gay person to become straight? (This has nothing to do with ""treating"" homosexuality)

The training for solicitors' reps is much better than it used to be, you're not going to get the secretary turning up on a busy day as used to happen sometimes, and - if it's at all serious - you're going to get someone who's (at least partly) legally qualified, but be aware that solicitors' firms sometimes employ ex policemen etc.  It's better to have a phone number of a legal aid firm you trust in your wallet and to get the police to contact them.

A 50% hit rate on good vs bad players is terrible if you are director of football. With the amount of money spent at Liverpool or Spurs I think anyone could have done a better job of finding players for positions, which is what he didn't do.

- There aren't too many bigger names than Cruyff in the game, and without the appeal of Champion's League football, he could be a REAL drawing point for some top players to come in.
- He obviously knows his stuff. Has done wonders with youth in Barca and Ajax.
- Spanish and Dutch connection. Two of the biggest capitals of the game right now, I need not say more.

What Lokian Eule is saying is that the box itself is likely just the ordinary weight of a Police Box, as all of the TARDIS's ""bigger on the insidedness"" is in a separate dimension, unconnected to the physical box.

Rory points this out in ""Vampires in Venice"" and this is corroborated by the Doctor. For further understanding of how the interior and exterior are unconnected see [this video of the Fourth Doctor explaining the mechanics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvnKXOGYKM8).

Also, in ""Father's Day"" the TARDIS's interior became disconnected from it's exterior (resulting in a normal Police Box) when the Reapers surround the area. This would further seem to prove that the actual physical box is a usual Police Box, but it merely is connected to an inside housed inside a separate dimension.

Further analysis of the TARDIS falling in ""The Satan Pit"" and ""Cold Blood"" would suggest that although it has a higher resilience to pressures and damage than an average Police Box, it does not have the weight of the entirety of the interior.

I hope this answers any questions in a relatively definitive way. ",0,1334284310,null,0,false,0,c4bnn8k,t3_s76zr,t1_c4bnn8k,t1_c4bngd0,null,1428710643,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"First thing I'd like to do is note my own tardiness. I've put off responding to you, not out of neglect, but of respect. I've had many things to do and wanted to sit down and respond to your points properly, as quite a lot of the animosity here seems to have been bred out of misunderstanding and malformed assumption than an actual divergence in ideals.

Allow me to just take you major points and then (without any opinion or presupposition) address them in a clearer way:

&gt; She didn't leave a note because it's a time machine. And the Doctor did specifically tell her that she could be back at any time- she even asks if they could be back 'tomorrow' and he said absolutely.

To this I respond with contextualization. Even if we were to ignore the fact that the TARDIS has shown unreliability when dropping companions off (Aliens of London, School Reunion) let's just look at the TARDIS from Amy's point of view:

In The Eleventh Hour the Doctor promises that he would return ""in five minutes"" after a trip in the TARDIS. That trip ended up being *16 years*. The Doctor later makes this clear that the mishap was unintentional and that it was a malfunction with the TARDIS.

Once again in the Eleventh Hour the Doctor leaves with the intent of returning immediately, this time being off by *two years*. Again, the Doctor makes this known that this is not his intention and is a byproduct of the TARDIS's unreliability.

Amy's sole personal experiences with the Doctor and time travel is that the Doctor will say that he will return at a certain time and then be off by *years*. She understood that this was unreliable. How could she forget? The Doctor *not* being on-time was one of the biggest moments of her life, one that she suffered *deeply* for.

Now Amy already understands the pain of being left waiting for a faulty time machine, but she does not consider this with Rory, instead choosing to go on an adventure with the Doctor. This is rather irresponsible seeing as her *only* experiences with the TARDIS have been seeing it become *dreadfully* late.

&gt; The Doctor came for her in a random night she wasn't expecting. His arrival wasn't planned. Rory would not make any assumptions because he wouldn't even know about it. It's a coincidence that the Doctor even appeared one day before Amy's wedding. 

This is precisely my point. As I said, Rory did not think that Amy would fly off because such an assumption would be *insane*.

&gt; She didn't stop to consult Rory about travelling because that's the general idiocy of companions in general. Rose didn't think about it, Martha didn't think about it, only Donna planned because she happened to meet him ahead of time. The companions drop everything at that moment and join him.

Ah, but the strange thing is that every one of those companions *did* consider their families. Rose and Martha ask for a phone to contact their families. Donna makes sure that they swing by to let her grandfather know where she's going. All of them managed (at least in hindsight) to let their families know that they were alright. Amy does no such thing for Rory, somebody who has given her an *immense* amount of care and dedication. This is mild and likely more bred from thoughtlessness than anything else, but it is definitionally inconsiderate.

Throughout the rest of your dialogue you refer to the TARDIS as an ""accurate time machine"", but it *isn't*. Amy has experienced this first-hand.

*Twice*.

The fact that she ignores this to go adventuring just shows another level of not thinking about the consequences of her actions. She has seen the TARDIS leave people waiting, but doesn't consider that she would be doing the same thing to Rory.

And let me address another supposition you made: That Amy was whisked away too quickly to confess or apologize to Rory.

However this is clearly just opinion, and there are a host of facts to refute this, several of which I've already pointed out.

In ""Vampires in Venice"" Amy has changed clothes and make-up. It is also assumed that she would have to have eaten and slept (and showered, she shows no signs of the gravel or other nastiness involved in Flesh and Stone) after the traumatizing events of the past episode. At the very least we are given ample evidence that she had time between these two adventures for composure.

So I find it remarkable that the Doctor, someone so irresponsible that the Psychic Paper was unable of lying about him being a ""responsible adult"" (A Christmas Carol), would be the person to get Rory involved and even be the first one to admit to the fling.

The fact that at no point during the ample time her and Rory were alone together did she admit to her ""fling"" with the Doctor (to me) speaks volumes on her character.

Again, it is the lying and deciet that bothers me about her character, and earlier I expound on her actions of violence (shooting the girl, killing Mme. Kavorkian) and intolerance (hating Ganger Doctor) have been vindicated through a self-serving fear: that of losing her Raggedy Doctor. I find that to be a *highly* unnoble motive compared to many of the other companions.

Now allow me to get more serious:

On the subject of rape, this is actually something very personal to me.

My close family member and even closer friend went to a party.

My cousin was drugged, taken away, and raped by two men.

First I want to dispel a lot of myths and really inaccurate presumptions you seem to have. First and foremost being that I said ""attempted rape"".

Rape is when a person attempts to have sexual relations with a partner who has not given consent.

That is *the legal* definition.

I think you seem to have this preconception that rape is a strong man brusquely forcing himself on a woman. Rarely is it ever like this.

Almost all cases of rape is between people who know and are close to each other, often through friendship or family.

Also, and I say this with the highest level of restraint. Please do not assume that 50% of the planet is incapable of rape.

That is, and I am attempting to restrain myself here, a very large leap of logic, and is very sexist.

I *know people* who have been raped by women. Again, it's not a backalley brutal scene all the time. Many times it's someone simply falling asleep at a party and then finding yourself being raped in your sleep.

Please, please, *please* do not make such hurtful assumptions. You assume I don't know how serious rape is, but I have seen it *ruin* lives.  I'm honestly really hurt that you would simply assume such a thing and then attempt to back it up by saying women aren't capable of such a crime, when thousands of people can attest that it is very, very real.

**EDIT**: Here on Reddit there have several popular AMAs of men who have been raped by women. One [by his own sister](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i73gg/iama_man_that_was_raped_by_a_woman_technically_a/), is a particular underscore of how many of these cases are between those who know each other personally.

Listen, I really don't like being upset, and I understand that you're a very bright person (how could we have continued this intelligent conversation for as long as we have if it *weren't* for that?) so I'm sure you understand how very hurtful and presumptuous those words were, so I don't think there's any need to rub it in your face. It was just a mistake caused by me touching a nerve that you said all those things, and for that I genuinely apologize.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"My introduction to Doctor Who was interesting. It, of course, began with the 2005 reboot a few years ago at the *insistence* of a good friend.

I criticized it *to the bone*. The cinematography (a small passion of mine) was distractingly atrocious! That bloom filter was absurd! And Rose was so ridiculously camp I nearly called it quits.

But at Dalek I realized what the show *really* could get to, and I became more and more fascinated.

I go through shows on rapid binges, but with Doctor Who I skipped episodes I thought would be too difficult to bear (this later became a boon to me, as even though I began to enter the Fifth Season, I could still have ""new"" adventures with Nine and Ten).

I ate through the episodes and quickly found myself loving the concept far more than the actual show (not to poo-poo the show, it's great, but the concept, that of going *anywhere* in time and space, is simply the single best concept I've ever heard). I cheered on the show as it's production values increased and the potential for deeper and more interesting topics arose.

I quickly became a fan of Doctor Who, but I was well aware I was missing out on *a lot*. So I tried to muddle my way through Classic Who (starting with the 1992 Pilot).

Although (I sheepishly admit) I haven't gone through hardly enough Classic Who than I'd like. Only a dash of Four through ""Genesis of the Daleks"" and a bit of the others through ""The Five Doctors"". I think my real problem is a lack of a solid compendium of high-quality sources for Classic Who like New Who has with Netflix.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"I don't know that I fit the particular demographic you're looking for, but I felt like speaking up anyway. When it comes to watching TV series, I'm a bit of a ""completionist."" That is, I like to see everything, start to finish. Since Doctor Who is such a well-established show, it was initially intimidating for me to get started, as well as where I should begin. I ended up biting the bullet and starting with the 2005-present stuff. Since I finished that, I've gone back to the beginning and have been working my way ever so slowly through the years.

I've been recommended by many people (including you, I think?) to skip around a bit and watch an episode or two from each Doctor before truly committing myself to the slog that is the first 26 seasons. And I am considering doing so, so that I at least have a talking point for each Doctor rather than being limited to 9, 10, 11, movie version of 8, and a season and a half of 1. But again, the completionist in me is insisting I go in order because, you know, ""spoilers.""

All that being said, the prospect of the radio dramas is wearing down my resolve to go in order. I was intrigued by 8 in the movie, and would love to get more of him. And to most fully appreciate the audio dramas, I feel I'd want a basic working knowledge of the classic Doctors, particularly 4-7.

So, tl;dr - yes, I am very interested in the radio dramas. But, as with all my introductions to fandoms, it's just a question of timing.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well I guess we're continuing on this, so I'll start off by saying that it’s clear that we both take rape seriously, and find each other’s previous usages of it personally offensive. I was offended, because until you said what you have now, it did not seem that you had given much thought to making such a serious claim against Amy besides the legal statement. I was upset that you applied something as serious as rape to what I consider a harmless scene of making a pass at a person. I do take rape seriously, I also have family members who’ve been victims. I was not using indignation to invalidate your argument, but to question how serious you had been considering your statement.

Let’s go back to your legal statement. Besides the fact that there can legally be rape with consent, all legal definitions of rape involving non-consent require a 'forcible compulsion' element. 

“Forcible compulsion is (1) physical force that overcomes such earnest resistance as might reasonably be expected under the circumstances; (2) threat or intimidation, either express or implied, placing the victim or another person in fear of death, bodily injury, or kidnapping; or (3) fear by a person under 16 years of age caused by intimidation by another person who is at least four years older than the victim.”

1. Amy did not use enough force to overcome ‘earnest resistance’. For one thing, the Doctor did not verbally or physically resist. He dodged around her and pulled up his suspenders. And because he was not drunk, drugged, asleep, or any other type of physical incapacitation, Amy’s pushing of him against the TARDIS is not forcible compulsion.

2. Obviously Amy was not going to kill, kidnap, or hurt the Doctor if he did not comply. Because he didn’t comply and she didn’t hurt him. Or even try to after he avoided her.

And three obviously does not apply here.

What happened between Amy and the Doctor was not rape. Also, I know that not all rape is full of physical brutality. I know that many rapes are ones in which one party is incapacitated. But such a situation doesn’t apply to the Doctor and Amy because they weren’t incapacitated.
When I say severe, I do not mean physical brutality. I mean that it is severe in the sense that it is serious or dire.

&gt;Please do not assume that 50% of the planet is incapable of rape.

I don't. I know that women do rape men. But it's a lot less common than men (not that it’s any less serious), and the fact is, is that no companion who is capable of rape is ever going to end up on Doctor Who. My statement that about doubting women would ever even try is wrong. I said that because, as I was typing that message, I was trying to imagine how someone who knew the fear of being raped could ever do the same. The flaw which lies therein is that rapists, male or female, probably do not fear rape themselves. I'm not sexist, I made an error in logic. 

As a last note, you did not say the exact two words “attempted rape” but you said essentially that. You said, “She didn't tell him she had tried to rape him.” “tried to rape” is essentially the same as saying “attempted rape”. I’m not creating presumptions.

As to everything else we’ve been discussing, we could argue back and forth on and on about all the different technicalities of the situation, and whether we believe that technicality A is worse than technicality B. Or whether Amy’s actions are more reprehensible in one situation versus another. We’ve both made good arguments for and against Amy’s culpability.

When I questioned your citation of facts, I described the required citations to be ones of “heinous” acts. I don’t think Amy has done anything so horribly heinous. We agree that she’s done selfish things, but this is the difference in values between us. You think that the reasons you’ve cited *do* constitute as “heinous” but I don't.. i.e. her shooting the girl is a horrible action that proves she is a terrible person. But I personally do not think so because Amy didn’t know it was a kid, all she knew is that it was going to kill the Doctor. Legally, one can kill another person in self defense or in defense of another without being charged. Not that we should bring even *more* legal junk into this (we’ll never end), but it reflects my, and apparently a good chunk of society’s, moral beliefs.

Or another example, your paragraph starting with “You know what really burns me up about Amy?” is full of what, in my personal opinion, are blatant exaggerations of her character flaws. The ganger Doctor situation is easily forgivable for me- deciding whether or not a sentient being who is exactly identical to someone you love is a huge moral dilemma. And fear of losing someone is a perfectly normal thing. I think that your statement of her being full of fear and hate, hate in particular, to be an exaggeration. Well maybe not, if you honestly can’t stand her. Though your statement that the other companions were fueled by noble sources is a broad generalization. As I said before, Rose left her family without any notice. She considered Mickey, but then she ran right into the TARDIS without leaving a message or telling anybody. Just what Amy did. Rose did this again in Doomsday. And Donna does the same thing. And tons of other companions too, really. So many of your statements I just fundamentally disagree with. And if you can’t stand Amy, do you really think I can convince you otherwise?

“as quite a lot of the animosity here seems to have been bred out of misunderstanding and malformed assumption than an actual divergence in ideals.”

The animosity was due to the rape, not our other disagreements, which I strongly believe, as much as I believe that air is a gas or that the sun emits light, are a divergence in ideals. I’ve been suggesting for several posts now that our disagreement is probably one of opinion, personal preference, fundamental ideals, etc., call it what you want.


Why do you think it isn’t? Do you think your ideals exactly match mine? Or that with logic and sound reasoning, you can make anyone agree with your view point? Well besides the fact that morals don’t even operate with logic, all definitions of “right” and “wrong” and whether something is “good” or “bad” or anything else really, all these definitions, are purely subjective. So it should be no surprise if we disagree to the ends of the earth. We don’t even need to go to a different planet to find societies whose values differ from ours. Not even a different continent. It used to be that if a woman was left by her husband, it was the woman’s fault because she wasn’t able to keep her man. Would that belief work in today’s society? Hopefully not! Don’t you think it’s possible that our ideals just differ?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Always happy for more input! I understand the completionist urge, but if it makes you feel any better, there are no real spoilers from a future Doctor that can ruin a previous one's story. Well except for the story where you find out that the Doctor is a Time Lord and can regenerate.

Yes, I did suggest you jump around. But since you're already dedicated, I don't think it's necessary. I suggest that route for people who aren't committed to watching it straight through. It should inspire confidence.

Well, since 4 is only just coming into the dramas, you don't have to worry about him (good, because he's got 7 seasons in the show).

Do I have any advice? Well, when I discovered the show, I jumped all around the new stuff. But then once I became committed to the fandom, my inner completionist emerged, and like you, I balked at the sheer amount of *stuff* in this fandom. Just thinking about all the books and comics and episodes and drams freaked me out. And all the spinoff dramas/shows/books (yes, they exist too).

My advice is to bite the bullet. It probably ruins the benefit of sequential development, but it's fun to gather tidbits scattered throughout the Whoniverse and make broad connections. Plus being completionist is very restrictive. I started random episodes of classic before I decided to go straight through. I'm listening to all recommended radio dramas before I go chronologically and fill in the blanks. Besides, you can always go back later and see it sequentially (me jumping around classic sure didn't hinder that). I jumped into the middle of the 8th Doctor Divergent arc and it still blew my mind (though it made the finale a lot harder to understand).",0,1334292393,null,0,false,0,c4bp8jt,t3_s7d13,t1_c4bp8jt,t1_c4boh2u,null,1428711389,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Yup, I've got tons to recommend. Jubilee, which is the better/more sophisticated version of *Dalek* whose perspective on the Daleks is interesting and not 'unfeeling monster gains emotions'. EDIT: The first few minutes of it are also funny.

Then the villain trilogy, all brilliant. *Davros* (6th), *Master* (7th), *Omega* (5th).

And the *I, Davros* special series which is an origin story outlining Davros's life from a child up to Genesis. One of the most culturally layered stories and brilliant with great tie ins and references. This series is what gave me confidence in Big Finish. I didn't realize how spoiled I was. It can be a little tough to get all the characters in your head at first (there are many) but it's wonderful.

And *Spare Parts* which is kind of like I, Davros in that you see the society the Cybermen came from before they were Cybermen. Also interesting tie-ins here and I love that they used the original sing-song Cybermen voice from *The Tenth Planet*. My favorite.

There are great timey-wimey stories like *Flip-Flop* which will blow your mind. Holy Terror is another amazing and kind of eerie story with 6. Fires of Vulcan is a great purely historical story (not like Fires of Pompeii).

And then I ranted about how wonderful two stories from the 8th Doctor's divergent arc were, and you really can jump in with minimal foreknowledge of the arc. Just know that they ended up in an alternate universe and they're having adventures there, and they're really weird.

Our troubles from that period may not have had as much to do with Comolli as with the idea that we should be profiting from player sales.

I've only watched one classic episode, and that was a Tom Baker episode. I liked him, but Tennant is still better in my opinion.

This all peaked during the Thatcher era in the early 1980's, where Liverpool's unemployment rate hovered around 17%. To put that into context, Detroit's current unemployment rate stands somewhere around 11%. So Scousers began to develop a reputations as all being either criminals or on the dole which still lingers today. People often make jokes about getting their car's hubcaps stolen at Anfield, and of course, Herry Einfield's infamous characters ""[The Scousers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qamVB4ixxGs)"" portray stereotypical caricatures of Liverpudlians.

I'll be in a white button down and a maroon bow tie and suspenders sporting a camera bag, sonic and one (or both) of the pictured reddit aliens my roommate made for me to take into NY as an identifier. 

Any questions? Trying to find me/us? Email my reddit email address pixenfaye@gmail.com and it will get to my cell phone!

If for some reason I get to NY and Who isn't filming, I'll be exploring the Kill Your Darlings shoot (confirmed for tomorrow) which is Daniel Radcliffe's new movie, or White Collar's shoot (also confirmed for tomorrow). I can't confirm that the stars will be there, but someone obviously will. 

A friend traveling with me is a *fantastic* cosplayer so at the very least we'll be taking pictures in Central Park trying to recreate the past two days of filming in pictures :D

I personally think that studies which look at race rather than cultural norms are looking at the symptoms rather than the cause. Your typical British Indian or Chinese kid will end up working in the family business, but that's due to how they see the family unit rather than the colour of their skin.

Ah, but were we? Of the players we bought, Adam had 1 season of PL experience, Henderson had 2, with only the second being as a regular starter, Carroll had about 1 season across 3 years (he played 14 games in the season Newcastle were relegated, and 19 before we bought him). Downing, Enrique and Bellamy were the only 3 who you'd say had significant PL experience - of the level you'd expect when pushing for an instant return to 4th.

&gt; I don't think the signings were particularly bad at the time, just overpriced.

They were definitely overpriced, but equally better signings could, possibly, have been made, either for that price or less.

&gt; I'd put a lot of blame on Dalglish for their failure

Yeah, he's not blameless; Carroll in particular seems to get better when he gets a regular run, only to be dropped straight back to the bench. It's bizarre. At the same time, the team's lost its balance without Lucas. I remember how your midfield was overrun early in the season before you signed Scotty Parker, and I see the absence of Lucas as a similar blow. Adam in particular has really struggled without Lucas to do the defensive work next to him.

No because Sheva was bought when he was already around 29/30 years old and was already starting to fall from his peak when he was sold, whereas Torres was around 26/27 and, barring injuries, was still banging them in on form for an albeit plummeting Liverpool.

Some of them did not even bother getting back to me"".  7 jobs in 6 weeks when you are applying for low skill work does not sound like a lot to me.  One then went on to blame Poles for coming over and being willing to work for £6.05.

To me it did not sound like racism but lack of understanding of how things work.  Lesson 1 of getting a job is you keep going, it does not matter how many times you get knocked back, how many people don't get back to you.  I would think that lesson 2 is to take what you can get and move up from there.  If £6.05 is the best you can get, take it and then maybe you can find something better in the mean time.

I don't think these were bad guys.  But I think a lot of people have no experience of getting a job.  God knows, I didn't when I started.  But over time you get to know how it is.

 - Build a tree house.
 - Chop down trees, then
 - Build rafts out of the logs with 2l coke bottles strapped to the underside and go adventuring down the local river.
 - Take BMX's to the local golf course and ramp over the tee off spots and into the dams.
 - Run like hell when the care taker comes after you in his van.
 - Tie a rope to a branch, then swing out over your local river before dropping in.
 - Fish in a farmers dam. When he spots you from the hillside above and starts shouting, pull down your pants and moon him then run like hell. Take my advice and try not to hide in a patch of nettles when he drives past looking for you.
 - Steal a farmers oranges, but expect to get chased down by a red faced bastard carrying a shotgun.
 - Climb a barbed wire fence and scale your local cell phone tower. (Bring a pillow case with you and tie it to the top as a flag when you get there)
 - Take long adventures. Set off on a Saturday morning and only get back at dusk.
 - Take your sleeping bag and camp out in an open field, under the stars and alongside a fire. Bring loud fireworks for mischief making.
 - Sneak up on a couple getting frisky in their car. Throw mud. Run like hell.

Why should a Muslim business be unable to trade for more than a few hours on a Sunday, when their holy day is a Friday?

I think this comment left on the article pretty much sums it up. 

*I suspect Sara Malm's inexperience has been exploited by the paper on a trolling exercise. This is a despicable way to treat trainee journalists. I would fail a student for submitting an opinion piece lacking in any journalistic skill: the piece is poorly-researched, ill-informed, juvenile in tone, and shows no understanding of politics or the strategies and processes involved in industrial disputes.  I genuinely will not buy the ipaper again - not because I disagree with the article but because this isn't journalism. It reads like the rant of a GCSE student and shouldn't have been published without the writer undertaking some research to support her argument. I would recommend Sara Malm join the NUJ - she's likely to need the support of her colleagues and some legal advice at this rate.*

Just to be clear, I in no way am suggesting to sell him. I haven't really put much stock into the idea that we can make a good judgement on our number 9 because I really think we're still trying to settle on what our long term goals in terms of tactics will be. I like the different options a pairing of Suarez and Carroll can provide us with - it gives us the ability to beat just about any type of defense, at least on paper.

After reading the Tomkins Times articles when DC was sacked and the one linked today on moneyball's impact on the squad, I wonder how our style will change when his replacement will be brought in. For instance, let's say Cruyff actually joins - will his philosophy match Carroll's style of play? The tika-takka, Dutch-Spanish style, whatever you want to call what he's famous for, seems to require more of a Suarez style forward than a Carroll style forward. So like I said, I've almost got to the point where I think we can't even make a proper judgement - good or bad - on his transfer until next season ends at the earliest. At the end of the day, this seems to be more of a Lucas situation, where we'll have to let a few things play out before we can come to a solid conclusion, so that's why I was curious about people's thoughts were when valuation was thrown into the mix of things to consider.",0,1334322529,null,0,false,0,c4bsd8r,t3_s7tj4,t1_c4bsd8r,t1_c4bsa09,null,1428712941,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Modric on the bench of course, but I haven't been to impressed with him. I do realise he's still a very good contributor to the team, because he's good at passing. Alternatives could be Parker/Kranjcar. But I've been very impressed with Livermore (yes, I know you all think he's been poor, but try getting more out of this uninspired team...)
Van der Vaart seems like one of few players who actually stills enjoys playing football, and I don't think I need to explain why Lennon is so important...
Adebayor, for his good workrate and ability to keep the ball up. Saha wouldn't be a bad choice in my eyes either, but generally, I'm a little more confident with Ade up top. 
Nelsen has stepped up and started playing better and better over the last few games. 
The combination of King and Nelsen as CB could leave us quite exposed due to lack of pace, but Gallas wouldn't improve upon that, sadly. 
Having Livermore/Parker keeping up the midfield, would allow Van der Vaart to play very freely. On top of that, I think that both Parker and Livermore can be very good on the attacking side.
Parker has been making a lot of good attacking runs, either pulling away some defenders from the rest of the (more creative) team, or helped creating decent chances. 
On top of that, I'm a very big admirer of Livermores passing game, taking the simple, yet effective things, has created a lot of good opportunities, and much more than for us to score, It'll help a lot in keeping Chelsea from scoring.",0,1334323974,null,0,false,0,c4bsktt,t3_s7uu5,t1_c4bsktt,t3_s7uu5,null,1428713031,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

Lescott and VK have been so damn good together!?  Look at our goals against.  Just a decent backup please.

Want to sell Dzeko and Nasri? Then you haven't looked at the Bosnain's scoring record or Nasri's assits.  Sure their form has been up and down but they ahve both produced some enough good games for me to think we should keep them.  Selling the strikers out on loan makes sense and I wouldn't mind seeing Tevez go on his way.  As good as he can be his attitude is obviously shit.

Aside from a good CB who is okay to not get regular first team football, we just need to sign some width, like Eden Hazard.  Not saying it should be Hazard because we may not be able to get him, but someone with his qualities would be nice.  And if it does end up being EH, good for us!

If we go down, then Sandro comes off for VDV and he pushes up to just behind Ade. I think Chelsea will try and constrict us in midfield, hence the two holding players, with Sandro slightly ahead of Parker in the formation. Ade will cause the joke that is Luiz problems with his movement, opening up the channels for Bale and Lennon, with Modric operating as a natural CM, not too far forward.

true,Kalivha,eng-warwickshire,Coventrry/Edinburgh,"&gt;Well, come to East Asia, where you will see far more nationalism and ethnocentrism than you will ever see in the UK. It can't be too unrealistic. And I think this benefits the inhabitants of those countries.

I was aware of this; doesn't mean I think it is right or makes much sense in the world I grew up in (where it has just been normal to look for jobs internationally to begin with, for example). I don't see how it benefits anyone. Please enlighten me on that.

&gt;Well, they don't think of you as one. Japanese people will treat you well as a guest, but it stops there. They would most certainly not consider you 'one of them' or 'part of the family'.

Oh, I'm aware of that. To a lesser extent, it's also true in the UK. Maybe that is actually why there's a problem with integration in the first place? As a European, it was much easier for me to get welcomed into Arab, South Asian and South East Asian communities here than British ones - not that I'm not integrated, I just found those people *even more welcoming*. I know part of it is that they have some issues with their own cultural identity, but that doesn't change how I am treated.

&gt;And then where is the native family supposed to live?

I don't think this should even be a question. For the native family, it's much more likely to be a question of cutting down on their commute (as it was for us).

&gt;Also, I think you would encourage more asylum seekers to come to the UK, rather than any of the any other countries in the world they could try. South Korea is legally supposed to take asylum seekers as the UK is, but in practice they don't, and there's no comeback on that for them.

I don't think this should even be an argument. It's not like the UK is the only country taking in asylum seekers, either.

&gt;a) Immigrants tend to be more religious.

And half the reason for that is that religion is a pretty good refuge when you feel unwelcome in a country. Don't get on with local groups? Go join some religious events with people from your country of origin and feel welcomed! I've seen it happen.

&gt;b) They have different moral systems to ours.

I haven't actually seen this affect anything. They don't tend to act on it if it's so different it poses a problem. They might be vocal about it (and I hate that sometimes), but their moral system isn't a complete 180 from ours to begin with, so they seem to get that they are supposed to live by the rules of the land (as it were).

If you are referring to ""honour killings"", I'd argue that's just crazy people and not *actually* a cultural thing.

&gt;c) Immigrants are on the margins of society and do not have their extended family or an established reputation in the UK to keep them on the straight and narrow. Their disadvantageous economic conditions may make them part of a growing 'underclass', who are more likely to be criminal. Their communities are likely to concerned about the community or ethnic group, and not so much about other ethnicities, or the UK itself.

I don't think immigrants usually are marginalised, and if they *are*, it's not really their fault, now, is it?

And I'm pretty sure a lot of them actually *do* have extended family in the UK, for better or for worse. When I first came here, I certainly did; they've all since moved on to other countries. 

&gt;d) British people are already here, and it is their birthright to be here. We can't just tell Japan or whoever to take them -- South Korea will say 'NO'. Do you think we live in a world where anyone can just move to and live anywhere they want, and the UK is the exception? 

I don't. I do think that it's not true that anyone can move to the UK (we *do* have immigration restrictions here, too) and at the same time I get annoyed at people in the UK/US moaning about their domestic job market when looking for graduate jobs because I've just been raised on the premise that it's unrealistic to expect to find good work without looking internationally. I realise this isn't true for everyone and every profession, but it is for some (and I personally only try to limit myself to ""anywhere but my home country"" - it would be anywhere but I've got some issues to work through). 

&gt;e) Immigrants do not share so many genes in common with us, and do not share our culture and language. This means that they do not care as much about us as they would do 'their own people'.

And it's reciprocated. It's not like they all come to the UK and hate the British and then the British are righteous in hating them back.

&gt;Also, the presence of immigrants makes natives more criminal, in that they are taking jobs.

Last time I checked, a lot of British don't work out of choice (consciously or not) and a lot of people don't even get visa extensions to do graduate jobs in the country. Take my flatmate, who is working a job that could arguably be done by a British person. He's just doing it for a few more months, mainly to support his sister-in-law, and then he's gone. It's not a big deal. This isn't really an argument. ",0,1334325397,null,0,false,0,c4bstay,t3_s30lx,t1_c4bstay,t1_c4bsa64,null,1428713141,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,M2Ys4U,null,Euro candidate,"&gt;I'm curious the degree to which you'd extend this logic to other industries.

Not very far at all, for two main reasons:

1. Pharmaceutical R&amp;D is already overwhelmingly paid for through public money anyway. As I cited above, 93.4% in the UK and over 80% taking the European average.
2. Public health is an exceptional sector. It is fundamentally important to everybody. Patents do a job (incentivising R&amp;D), but they do it in an inefficient, anti-competitive and extremely costly manner. Considering point #1, we're all paying for it, it shouldn't bleed so much public money.

&gt;Every time there was an expensive failure, it would become a scandal in the press, equivalent to the overspend on Wembley, or budget over-runs on the Olympics (the cost of commercializing a drug is about $1.7bn, which is about a third of the original Olympics budget, more than the cost of Wembley, and about ten times the cost of a normal stadium).

I'll answer this along with

&gt;There would be politicization of which drugs were developed (although that is arguably a good thing)

I don't think that would be the case, as long as it is kept (preferably by statue) away from governmental meddling. Funding should be awarded by an independent body, based not on political motivations but based on the advice of medical professionals and on public health grounds.

&gt; The link between demand for a drug, or for pharmaceuticals in general, and the ability for researchers to meet that demand, would be broken, and research funding, which has increased in Europe from 7 billion to 35 billion in the last 20 years (p9 of the report you quoted), would become subject to political whim.

To the first part, the break between demand and research, I'm not sure how much of a divergence there would be. The funding bodies should take in to account the demands for pharmaceuticals when allocating funds.

To the second, yes you have a point. There would indeed be a political influence on how much money was spent on R&amp;D. One would hope that reducing funding would elicit the same reaction as reducing funding for the NHS itself (i.e. it'd be politically unwise to do so), or it could be drawn from the NHS budget itself. Something to think about at least.

&gt; There would be huge public pressure to end animal testing, even if it was necessary for the development process.

There already is pressure to end animal testing, I don't see how it would change that much in that regard.

&gt; There would be pressure to use 'our drugs' within the NHS, in order to justify the expenditure.

Again, I doubt this. I don't think that people would play not invented here when lives are literally at stake. Efficacy and cost-per-unit are the only measures that should be taken in to account. That's why we have NDPBs like NICE.

&gt; What would happen is that the research would be pursued for a little while, and then slowly dropped as politicians realized it was more trouble than it was worth, and liable to damage their re-election chances.

""We're going to reduce healthcare spending!"" doesn't exactly sound like the rallying cry of a political party at election time to me.

&gt; Also, when you talk about 15% of the expenditure going on R&amp;D, it looks very bad, but it's more or less reasonable if you roll the figures around. Firstly, the data is skewed by generics sales- the more money a pharma company makes from generics, the lower its R&amp;D percentage goes. Secondly, it ignores reasonable costs of doing business- for instance administration, management and production costs in feedstocks, manufacturing plants and so on. It bears saying that pharma has one of the highest R&amp;D percentages of any industry.

This is all true, but I don't think it really has any baring on our argument. The generic-only pharmaceutical companies have these costs as well, and still turn a profit.

&gt;The final, I think fundamental argument, is that, if it was more efficient to do this through taxation funded research, couldn't we outcompete private companies in a mixed market? Set up a publicly funded pharma research company, that simply gets the drug to market, but which does no licensing or production, and the money saved through buying its products, when they are developed, would be sufficient to justify its continued existence. If this sounds like something which would never happen, because of the difficulty of setting it up, the level of public expenditure necessary, and because the benefits would only be felt a long time in the future, whereas the next election is in three years, well, there's exactly your argument why you need to keep private pharma companies around.

We're not saying that we have to get rid of private pharma companies. They can still exist, they can still do R&amp;D (and be paid for doing so). One of the issues at the moment is that researchers have to develop a treatment T, with patents P R and Q available to them while avoiding their competitor's patent C. While sometimes being forced in a new direction can be good, this forces work to be duplicated and sometimes the existing patented formula is just more effective.

With no patents, there's no incentive to hoard knowledge; research can be done in the open, one can reuse ideas, methods and formulae freely. Even with a publicly-owned research company, they'll still be constricted by patents and an information vacuum.",0,1334329664,null,0,false,0,c4btmj0,t3_rru2p,t1_c4btmj0,t1_c4avwi4,null,1428713524,2,false,PiratePartyUK,t5_2rhop,2

Presumably he's referring to being nice to people, being gentle, kind, helping those less fortunate than yourself etc. Funnily enough I'm an atheist and do all of those things and have never thought of them as ""Christian teachings"", but prefer to think of them as ""not being a dick"".

Presumably he's NOT referring to the ""Christian teachings"" that promote homophobia, circumcision, not eating pork or shellfish and having the village elders stone your children to death if they're cheeky to you. I don't *think* he's wanting those ones shouted about.

Physically, all those player examples are something completely different compared to Carroll, different type of attacking players. Gomez, Ibrahimovic, Janker, Crouch, Tore Andre Flo, Drogba, Jan Koller, Alen Bokšić would make a bit farer comparison...albeit physically somewhat similar to Carroll, Crouch and Flo are a different type of players, imho.

Any reasoning drawn from the incident with Shelvey could be challenged with [Andy's goal against us last season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5aHzVPtJRU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=148s). Which leads to one of things that really bug me: not utilizing Carroll's monstrous left foot. It might be because he lacks in the football-brain-department (I somewhat agree with you on this), because of our tactics or that the team lacks creativity but he's not getting enough shots. I could see him scoring couple of those kind of goals like against Exeter and Oldham. Yes, they were lesser teams but still...

Chelsea's default move when there's not much on is to pass it back to Cech and have him hoof it up in the air. With Drogba's physical presence and chest control, this was a legitimate out ball. With Torres, its just a waste of possession.

true,nethertwist,null,null,"I see a lot of negative opinions towards this article in the comments, which is to be expected on reddit - a largely atheist, secularist demographic, as is most of the UK. I am a UK atheist myself.

On the one hand, I agree - religion has no place in government policy, campaigning, etc, and I shudder to think of a British Santorum gaining support (though such a thing is improbable). However, I think some of what Cameron says here is perfectly acceptable; he's certainly not proposing theocracy.

One thing that needs to be considered is that Britain, unlike the US (which as we know has a heated secularist debate) is arguably, and certainly used to be a Christian nation. You can't point to the wording of the original constitution here and say our country was founded upon secular government. For a long time now the monarch has been the head of a British Christian foundation and you can't attack a national idea like that, for the same reason you can't attack a big idea like personal freedoms in the US, right to bear arms, etc. It's a principle of the nation - don't like it? Then get out.

Of course, we're not a monarchy any more and certainly in recent years you wouldn't say we're a Christian nation. What I think Cameron is saying here or implying with his support of Christianity is his support of traditional British culture - something many (including myself) feel has been diluted and somewhat lost by several generations of immigrants from different areas of the world, including a large Muslim population. To be a bit more personal here, it's not that I want all the immigrants to bugger off back to their own countries - for many, this country is as much their home as ours, which I accept. But our government, the core of our nation, should stay strong and rooted in our own, fundamentally British, yes, even Christian culture; not pander to and avoid stepping on the toes of immigrant culture and religion. Tolerate other cultures, yes - but don't let them supersede the national ideas and people. 

I may have gone off on a tangent somewhat but I had a point I came here to say and I felt I should do it justice.

true,keizersozei,flair5,,"Jermain has gone quiet about this since Capello took over. I guess he fancies his chances of making the England team once Redknapp takes over whatever club he's playing for next season (hopefully Spurs).

I'm also a bit confused about Liverpool's need for Comolli. A lot of their purchases being from the Premier league has its own reasons. Liverpool were struggling with the new 25 man rule where at least 8 players were home grown. Together with the fact that Torres had just been sold for £50m - the whole world knew that this money was going to be spent on new players. 

At Spurs, Comolli was ok. Levy is a big fan of Arsenal's system, and so during Comolli's time at the lane, there was an influx of young potentials through the door. Quite a few of them were just too raw for us like KPB, Taarabt, Dos Santos etc. 

Although I heard that Bentley and Bent were signings made by Comolli (2 of our worst signings from the last decade), I think this reflects his hunger for commission. It wasn't a big gamble to think that both players would sell for more than their £15m price tag at a later date. Unfortunately, we didn't need them at the time they were bought. I think if a club sign a player for £10m+, the manager HAS to WANT to play them. 

If Comolli was responsible for half of the good signings he made during his time at Spurs, the above mentioned mistakes cancel his successes down to 0. ",0,1334337550,null,0,false,0,c4bvaok,t3_s6jom,t1_c4bvaok,t1_c4brhfo,null,1428714314,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Reasons?

- Modric, if it didn't happen last season when Chelsea weren't in crisis and had CL football, its not happening now.

- Hulk, non starter. Porto will not sell for less than the release clause.

- Higuain, RM don't need to sell. Only reason it would happen is he wanted out. And frankly I could see better destinations for him than Chelsea right now.

- Pereira, AVB wanted him. No one else. Not happening.

- Gotze, New contract. Not happening.

- Azpilicueta, The only one thats actually possible. Still unlikely because he's overpriced and we'd probably look to concentrate our resources on sorting out AM and wing positions rather than backup RB.

- Cavani, Possible if we really want him, but with Torres, Lukaku and Sturridge (a combined outlay of around 75m over the last 3 seasons), do we really?

- Hazard, Everyone wants him. And we're not currently the most favourable destination for players.

_______________________

What I'd like to see..

McEachran get an active role. De Bruyne starting on the wing. Kakuta brought into the first team setup (not an automatic starter but definitely an option). 

- Sign Kagawa for depth in the Mata role. 

- Sign a good deep lying playmaker. Doesn't have to be a big name or a rising star like we seem to be looking for in every signing. Think more along the lines of Ballack, experienced pro at a snip.

- A young backup RB who won't mind being 2nd choice to Ivan but has the potential to mature into a starter.

- Another winger wouldn't go amiss. Take your pick from Jovetic, Lavezzi, Muniain, Susaeta, etc

&gt;Sharia law

I actually hate this argument. Apart from the fact that it's not bad in itself (as it is merely a very loose framework for lawmaking), it is also islamically required (as per Sharia) to obey secular law ([Qur'an 5:1](http://quran.com/5/1) refers to it, actually). I am pretty sure that this will only apply to those who choose to have it apply to them, in any case (unless you break the law itself) but I don't want to post something when I'm not sure I'm interpreting it correctly. It boils down to [""Let there be no compulsion in religion""](http://quran.com/2/256). Obviously there is a whole world of problems because extremists don't really tend to care for Qur'anic evidence unless it suits them, but that's an issue that I would not want to call ""Sharia Law"".

&gt;Whereas Samsung...

I am not sure how this is a good thing.

I think it's impossible to determine whether isolationism is good or bad. I'd say it strongly depends on country. Germany is doing really well with an economy that is very internationally focused; the UK isn't mainly because we import but don't export. 

&gt;But are there enough council homes for everyone in the UK who wants one?

&gt;What if there are some troubles in Africa, and we get twice the expected number of asylum seekers for a year. Are there still enough council homes for everyone?

Again, I don't think preference here should be given to people based on their nationality. Also, I think part of the reason this is an issue at all is that the council housing system in the UK is a mess. I'd rather go about fixing that than denying people asylum. The only ""asylum seekers"" I've dealt with personally are people who came to the UK for education and are now stuck here because their home country turned into a mess since. It's more of a bad coincidence than anything.

Plus, ultimately this reflects positively on the UK - we want to be here because there's so much awesome, simply put.

&gt;Well, I suppose some other European countries are taking in some. But why isn't every developed country in the world doing their bit? We are disadvantaging ourselves with a burden some other countries do not have. And how are so many asylum seekers getting to the UK without having travelled through a safe country first? It's not like we are next to a warzone.

Air travel? I'm not saying the UK should take in more asylum seekers than other countries. I am, however, also not saying that just because others aren't doing what they should, the UK should stop, too. 

As mentioned above, I've met people who came here for a year to do a postgrad or something, and ended up being asylum seekers by the end of the year. The world is messed up, wars start even if people are abroad for a while.

&gt;Well, I was thinking of immigrants from Islamic countries (and Catholic Poles), but I guess there's that too. I don't think that's a good thing.

Oh, I agree. The thing is, I've migrated multiple times, I know how it feels. Back home I actually lived with some people who were like ""hurr durr, we're away from our family, let's be the worst possible Muslims we can and spend every day drinking vodka and eating bacon!"", so it kinda goes both ways.

What I was mostly referring to is that I know people (mainly from Pakistan) who were completely non-religious back home and have kind of found a bit of comfort in going to one Urdu language religious event a week while otherwise living a perfectly normal, well integrated life. Of course, this potentially opens them up to influence from some hateful extremist people, but I think it's not like Islamic extremism is the only source of senseless violence and hate crime in the UK - or even anywhere near the main source.

When I moved into a more urban area within the UK and had this plan to start socialising more, I tried out all sorts of groups and ended up sticking with Islamic societies (and actually becoming Muslim, *horrible, right?*) because they were the only ones whose activities were the sorts of things I enjoy (curry, debating, henna and lots of hugs with no alcohol or other distractions I'd like to avoid). 

&gt;But they have a holy book that tells them to do that. And they take their holy book pretty seriously.

Which also tells them not to kill people. Like, say, [here](http://quran.com/5/32). You can interpret *anything* to be hateful. 

The bits which ""tell them to"" do violence of any form are actually very clear about the circumstances (which actually entail a public display of whatever thing is being punished) and even the death penalty for murder (which is prescribed in the Qur'an) is discouraged right thereafter. [Source](http://quran.com/2/178)

Obviously there is a lot of messed up cultural stuff, but you get the same thing happening in Western culture, it's just not called ""honour killings"". Maybe we should do a better job teaching people how this stuff is wrong. 

&gt;Aren't there Islamic priests in the UK who have called for 'fatwas'? Have any Anglican priests done anything like that recently?

1) Nothing wrong with fatwas per se. You get similar customs in Jewish communities but they don't have a word for it we take issue with, so they're cool. I mean, obviously you get some fatwas that are clearly bad, but I don't think the solution here is to stop all immigration, it's to educate and/or remove extremists who have credentials and/or rhetoric skills.

&gt;And I'm also thinking of immigrants of Asian origin being loyal to their ethnic group or creed. I spoke to many Asians at my UK university about the unfairness of 'Asian Graduate Recruitment Fairs' in the UK, and they all agreed that they were unfair, but that didn't seem to stop them attending, and I didn't hear about any protests from Asians, not even the 'Asian Society' in our university.

Why would they protest about something that benefits them? Plus, a lot of companies in the UK prefer not hiring Asians.

Also, I've looked into those before and a lot of them seem to actually focus on jobs in Asia which non-Asians don't usually want to take. We're talking about South Asia here, right? I've never seen anything like that for East Asia.

And being loyal to a group isn't really a bad thing, either. What I've mostly met is that if you actually are nice to them, they'll reciprocate. That's how people work. It's actually kind of funny how much free food you can get out of saying Pakistan Zindabad once. 

It's also perfectly natural to want to have things in common with people. I don't think having different communities in one place (as long as measures are in place to minimise animosity between them) isn't great.

&gt;Depends on how you assign blame, if at all. If they can't speak English properly, whose fault is that? If they don't have childhood UK friends, because they didn't grow up here, whose fault is that?

I only have one friend in the UK who doesn't speak English; she doesn't because she's just a simple person and she keeps out of the way. She doesn't take anyone's jobs or money (apart from medical emergencies), her husband is a PhD student with 3 jobs on the side. He's contributing, I'd say, and I know she went to the doctor once in the past half year, I don't feel like anyone should deny her that. 

Most people I know who come to the UK with very poor English take a semester, or a year, to learn it once they're here, which again actually puts money into the system (in many cases GCC government money!). I realise that I'm not really familiar with all *kinds* of immigrants we get here, and I did know the other kind back home, but I still felt that we should make an effort to help them be in Europe because it's pretty cool here and I just really don't believe in birthrights. 

&gt;&gt;And I'm pretty sure a lot of them actually do have extended family in the UK, for better or for worse.

&gt;Yup. Can't say I'm overjoyed about that either, of course.

Well, yeah, I'm not surprised. I don't think there's a point in me arguing this separately.

&gt;So, South Korean and Japanese graduates can get graduate jobs in the UK. Can Brits get graduate jobs in those countries? Only as English teachers; never anything else. (This is also true for academics: South Korean professors can be employed in the UK, but extremely rarely can a professor get an academic job in South Korea.) Why on earth do we disadvantage ourselves when we don't have a mutual agreement to do so? Or when there is a mutual agreement, why aren't other countries held to it?

I honestly don't know enough to know if they just produce better graduates there (it didn't seem to be the case when I looked into universities to apply to). I do know that I have an uncle who held a professorship in China for a while - I am not sure it's comparable, but it's always seemed like they had similar HE policies. 

Why I'm saying this is because there *are* countries (which are less advantaged) that actually prefer UK graduates over homegrown professionals.

&gt;OK, but I don't think this is good for us. I think it is 'divide and conquer' by our ruling class. We were divided along class lines before, and now we are also divided into 'ethnic communities'. When some of these ethnic communities vote, they will vote based on what is good for their countries of origin (see George Galloway and the Respect party), not necessarily on what is good for me or the UK.

I don't think this is much of a problem as those votes don't count; and again, I fail to see some of the distinction here. Lots of people in Scotland vote SNP, understandably, which is not exactly good for the rest of the country. Does this mean you're also saying Scottish people should leave the UK? Not that I'm trying to start a debate on whether Scotland should secede...

Furthermore, there is this miraculous thing that I've seen happening that ethnic lines blur a lot. Usually British people don't really care about the plight of people in other countries, or even of other groups. The same is true for people who are in their home country pretty much anywhere. But immigrants (or generally minorities) tend to actually go and make things happen. We're doing events for Syria and Palestine here mainly - the Syrian events are mainly organised by Syrian nationals and have people from everywhere helping (Malaysians, Americans, Kazakhs), the Palestine ones I haven't really been to but I don't think they're even organised by Palestinians. We have random stuff going on for other places and causes, too, these two just sort of stood out in the past few months.

&gt;Well, that's what's going to happen when you have a system that pays you not to work (not much alternative here admittedly) but then punishes you when you get a part-time or temporary job, and when almost all unskilled jobs involve getting treated like crap and cheated out of wages and benefits, while barely making enough to live on. It is also what happens when you have a culture of joblessness, because the main employer in town has shut down. Some places have generational unemployment. People will only prostrate themselves before potential employers in the job search for so long.

I live in one of those places. Most people in our street seem to be unemployed. Most Asians in our street work full time. It's not like they work nearby, either, they are just more willing to work. That said, I know Asians who are so lazy and display such an utter lack of seriousness that it kind of infuriates me, but at least around here they seem to be the only people who work at all and it's probably not because employers prefer them...

&gt;If immigrants didn't come, wages, benefits, working conditions, recruitment practices, and societal participation amongst native Brits, would be better. British people would have more work experience too, and be more motivated to prepare for a job they want (because employers would be friendlier and jobs would be better).

Wages, possibly. Benefits, I don't think Asians actually have a right to them? I'm European and I don't, as far as I've looked into it. Recruitment practices? I'm not sure what you mean by this. 

I don't understand why a lack of immigrants would make employers friendlier toward native Brits. Please explain.

I don't really get the part about work experience personally because I've just been raised on the premise that early on work experience should be abroad, anyway. And it's not like Pakistan is the only place with jobs for white people. There is some room to be picky. 

I do get why people would want to stay in their home country/area, sort of, so I suppose they should have the right, but I think people should equally have the right to go to wherever they please. I'm not saying everyone should be let into the UK, I'm saying everyone should be on equal footing as far as possible - like how I can go to Dubai to go party for a weekend or whatever but most Asians can't without buying a visa. What? it's illogical.

&gt;a lot of people don't even get visa extensions to do graduate jobs in the country.
&gt;
&gt;If so, I'm very glad of that.

This is actually something where we somewhat agree, although probably for different reasons.

&gt;It is a big deal, as a British person is unemployed because of that.

You can't just say ""one immigrant working here less, one more job for a British person"". It's often not as simple as that. Maybe no British person will take the job; maybe they won't hire anyone who won't work extensive overtime or something; and maybe the employer has a quota of non-natives to hire (which I'm not claiming is actually good for unskilled labour because it just reinforces the idea that people are somehow separated like that in any significant way).

I say let's stick him on the right wing for a Carling cup/FA cup game next season and see if he can do a Bale. I think/hope that his close control is as good as the other parts of his game. Or at the very least for the sake of my ranting argument......

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I'm not trying to make someone agree with my viewpoint. You've obviously got a different perspective than I do and I certainly wouldn't want to try and bleach that diverse opinion out of you simply because I don't share it. That would be rude and presumptuous, and it's not what I've set out to do.

Ideals can (ad I frankly think oftentimes *should*) differ. Variety, as they say, is the spice of life. However a lot of your opinions of Amy seem to be propped up on misunderstandings or flat-put fallacy. I can accept you have a different opinion than me, but many times throughout our conversation you've either ignored facts or created suppositions without reason.

I'm going to go through here and address things in a concise and manageable manner:

**Bachelor Parties and Amy's Flight**

&gt; [Bachelor Parties are] one last fling before they're [men] ""chained"" for life. **Guys have bachelor parties but Amy can't make a pass at someone else who she knows she's never going to have a long term relationship with anyways[?]** [...] Amy is seriously getting your hate for doing the same thing that many guys around the world must do. [... I'm comparing] the idea that it's okay for males in society to have bachelor parties and why it's suddenly horrible for Amy to have her own version. **I was not comparing Rory's bachelor party with Amy's ""cheating"". [...] I'm not comparing bachelor parties to what Amy did!**

(Contradictions are in bold)

In here you create a strawman to both assert that bachelor parties are meant as flings before being ""chained down"" and that Amy's actions are equivalent to this, and that I would be hypocritical to find Rory's party acceptable and Amy's flight unacceptable.

You fail to correct yourself after I point out the fallacy in several ways, namely that Rory's Stag Party is a clear breach from the ""one last fling"" model you erroneously applied to the idea and that the two events are done in *very* different ways.

It is only when I point out that there *actually* is a distaff counterpart to Stag Parties that is *literally* the equivalent and the fact that Amy already had one that you say ""your hands are up"" but at no point do you admit the fallacy you made. I've highlighted how your presupposition that Amy has a right to have ""one last fling"" because men ""have one last fling"" in the form of Stag Parties, justifying a specific with a general. you say so right here:

&gt; My point about bachelor parties is that Amy, just like any guy, should be allowed to 'have a fling' likes males can.

And even though I point out that Amy is indeed allowed to have a fling (and she very much did) and that any inequality you're perceiving is not in the actual show and is in fact imagined by yourself you still do not admit the fallacy. Instead you try to shift the act of running away from being ""one last fling"" in retaliation for her deprivation of such right (a presumption you formed earlier, see above) to being a non-romantic voyage taken because he's ""the Doctor"".

**Amy's Leaving and Time Travel**

&gt; She didn't leave a note because it's a time machine. [...] There was no special situation of dire need except for the wedding which Amy wasn't going to miss (accurate time machine).

As I've stated Amy had no assurance nor prior knowledge that this would be the case. In fact there is a consistent trend that should give her cause to believe *the exact opposite*.

Every time the TARDIS had promised to return at a brief date it has been off by *years*, not just in New Who's history (which has been shown multiple times in Aliens in London, Parting of the Ways, and School Reunion) but in Amy's personal history *twice*. It is fallacious to assume that Amy had no fears of being late, when she is given every reason to not trust the Doctor on this matter.

Her actions do make internal sense, but they aren't based on logic (if she had based it on logic she would assume she would be late) but rather on her selfish desire to run off with the Doctor.

**Rory's Homophobia**

&gt;  Rory wasn't respecting the Doctor by looking away, he's straight, he has no interest in watching the Doctor. And if he did watch (with or without disinterest) he could be accused of being gay, and heaven forbid someone is gay in our society...

This is opinion stated as fact, and it's fallaciously formed. First you presume that Rory (a med student and therefore someone who is very much used to both sex's anatomies who is also a nurse whose shown confidence in his own sexuality and masculinity) would not be alright in watching the Doctor because people would believe him to be gay. Not only do you have no evidence to place this as his motive, but you make the *further* presumption that this means he wasn't watching out of respect (something that makes no sense, as Rory has consistently shown respect to every stranger he meets *to a fault*. See The Hungry Earth for a strong depiction of this). 

And just setting aside how ridiculous it is to A.) presume Rory is afraid of being called gay and B.) Rory's motivations for looking away could not be out of courtesy and let's move onto the second part of your statement ""heaven forbid someone is gay in our society...""

Presuming that this is sarcasm I infer that you are making a judgement on the show for shing away from depictions of homosexuality or anything resembling it.

To which I say: Seriously?

New Who has *consistently* portrayed homosexuality in a positive right, portraying it not as a negative, but as a unique character attribute. Se: the entirely of Capt. Jack Harkness's appearances, The Waters of Mars, Day of the Moon, A Good Man Goes to War, Closing Time and so *so* many other episodes of Doctor Who portraying homosexuality as something that's not to be shied away from.

Really, this is probably the single least logical argument you've put forth, but let's continue...

**Time Between Flesh and Stone and Vampires in Venice**

You attempt to say that Amy's deceit in not confessing her attempt to bed the Doctor to Rory is not, in fact, deceit because:

&gt;Think about the speed of the scene. Amy snogs the Doctor and then they immediately rush off to tell Rory. There was no cool down time, Amy didn't even know where the Doctor was taking her, she was thrust from snogging, to the TARDIS, and to Rory. [...] [S]he didn't even get a chance to get her thoughts together. That's the point- she had no chance before the Doctor took her relationship into his hands and did it for her, as if she's not an adult who can tell Rory herself. There was no deceit because there wasn't even any time for deceit to brew. The chance to decide how she'd take account for her near-cheat was taken from her. No deceit.

In here you assume that there is ""no deceit"" because Amy's transition from trying to have sex with the Doctor and the Doctor bringing in Rory was too abrupt to collect her thoughts, to which I say that the facts show this to quite likely not be the case.

Amy changes wardrobe and makeup between Flesh and Stone and Vampires in Venice. She also is not tired hungry, or covered in sweat and gravel, implying that she also slept, ate, and bathed during the mediation between the two episodes. This is ""cool down time"", something you claim wasn't present.

Further, there was enough time for the Doctor to *also* change wardrobe, ask who Amy was about to marry, learn it is Rory, locate where Rory is, go to where Rory is,  meet a stripper, learn the strippers name and get to know her, hide in the stripper's cake, get wheeled in, pop out, wait for the shock to die down after admitting he's been travelling with Amy, convince Rory to come with him, leave the party with Rory, and go into the TARDIS.

During all of this time Amy does not step out of the TARDIS to help the doctor get Rory, and further acts as if his inclusion was not her choice.

Then at multiple times long after Rory has joined the group she is alone with him to talk. This happens on multiple occasions throughout the episode and long after it as well, after having *days* to think about what she did.

At absolutely no point does she tell Rory what she did. And she certainly doesn't apologize.

This *is* deceit, as it is Amy hiding a secret from Rory despite the Doctor's clear intent for Amy and Rory to speak with each other again.

For comparison the Doctor is so irresponsible that the Psychic Paper could not convince a child that he was certified as a ""responsible adult"" (mind you this same paper is able to show people certification from the Archbishop of Wales among other ludicrous lies), and yet *he* is the one to get Rory involved *and* is the first person to confess what happened, while Amy had not.

**Amy's Violence**

&gt; But I personally do not think [Amy shooting a child is wrong] because Amy didn’t know it was a kid, all she knew is that it was going to kill the Doctor. Legally, one can kill another person in self defense or in defense of another without being charged.

Self-defense. Otherwise known as defense *of the self*. Amy has no certification that this Astronaut is the Astronaut that kills the Doctor, this is merely her suspicion. 

The Astronaut is also unarmed. You can't kill someone simply because you *think* that in some undetermined point in the future they'll kill *a friend of yours*. And you certainly can't shoot an unarmed person and claim it as ""self-defense"". What she did *was* out of irrational fear (the Doctor said that his death must happen and to not interfere, but she just wouldn't listen to him and let go) and it *was* an attempt to murder someone because of it.

Legally she attempted to murder an unarmed child. Whether she knew it was a child or even knew that it was armed is irrelevant. If the case had gone to court she would have been jailed, there's no defense for her actions other than ""done out of irrational fear"".

**Gender Bias**

&gt; This wouldn't be a problem if the Doctor was female.

You make several statements showing how you assume that it's alright for one gender to do something, but it is not okay for another gender to do so. This is not only inaccurate, it shows a horribly skewed perception of the world. You claim that somethings (like bachelor parties) are alright for the opposing gender to do but not the other, despite all evidence to the contrary.

But just for an exercise's sake, let's picture the gender's reversed:

A young boy meets an amazing woman who promises to come back for him. He spends sixteen years in therapy pining for her, making dolls, painting pictures of her, and getting his girlfriend to dress like her.

Then she returns. He handcuffs her to a radiator without a key and impersonates a police officer. After she frees herself and questions whether he is the same little boy he slams her tie into a car door and further intimidates her.

The Doctor saves the day and Male Amy watches her while she's dressing desipte his girlfriend asking if he was going to turn away. 

The Doctor disappears for two years and he is engaged to be married to Female Rory, whom he often makes fun of and punches (but makes sure to let know that he loves her). He then leaves (without leaving a note) to go off with this other woman he spent his childhood obsessing over (and who he watched dress). 

Food for thought on that, as that seems to fit the mould of a womanizer to me.

**Putting Words in My Mouth**

&gt;  I described the required citations to be ones of “heinous” acts. I don’t think Amy has done anything so horribly heinous.

Ctrl+F.

""Heinous"".

Please note that at no point do I call Amy's actions ""heinous"". Selfish, self-serving, thoughtless, inconsiderate, immature, irresponsible, mean but not ""heinous"". All of the adjectives I have used have been on the proper scale, I didn't even refer to her attempted murder or successful murder as ""heinous"", even though *murder* is pretty bad.

I don't say ""unforgivable"" either. All of Amy's actions could easily be rectified by owning up to her actions and taking responsibility. She does not formally so this.

** Companions Thinking of Families**

&gt; As I said before, Rose left her family without any notice. She considered Mickey, but then she ran right into the TARDIS without leaving a message or telling anybody. Just what Amy did. Rose did this again in Doomsday. And Donna does the same thing. And tons of other companions too, really. So many of your statements I just fundamentally disagree with. And if you can’t stand Amy, do you really think I can convince you otherwise?

This has nothing to do with Amy, this is me stating facts:

In ""End of the World"" Rose wants a connection to home and receives an upgraded cell phone, which she uses multiple times to stay in contact with her family (we see more of the extent of this in ""Love and Monsters"" about how much she cares about her mum). This was not immediate, but it did indeed happen.

Martha specifically requests the ability to speak with her family and has a *very* close relationship with them, which she maintains (sporadically) across her travels.

Donna's first thoughts with the Doctor are of letting her grandfather know where she is and that she's travelling with the Doctor, and they fly by his telescope to let him know this.

All of the companions thought about their families a few episodes in. At no point does Amy think of getting in touch with Rory without serious prodding from the Doctor. This is just a fact.

**In Summary**

This isn't an issue in ideals. Had you said that you think going off for weeks with someone else is just fine and that not telling your spouse about it is alright, I would have (quite begrudgingly) accepted it.

But that's not what you did, is it? You attempted to justify those opinions through faulty logic.

Basically, I'm a bitter, defeated, cynical bastard who is convinced that the crystal maze was in reality a tiny studio and the 'maze' was a product of fiction - each room being knocked up on the fly, while the contestants, press-ganged into some fledgling 90s 'team-building exercise' sat around in shell suits, mooched around waiting for the floor manager to tell them to look excited. Whereas my friend is convinced that a warehouse actually existed with 4 different 'zones' and a bit in the middle.

I'd love to think like that, and that the show was conducted in real time, and there would have been all sorts of awkward things happening - like getting 'locked in' and having to spend the rest of the filming session pacing around a tiny room going all stockholm (espescially funny if you got locked in with one of those 'extras' that posed questions, like 'granny') but I know it's bollocks.

With that in mind, I'd, in hindsight, get locked in on purpose then fuck off to the canteen for a coffee in a sausage roll. Alas, my friend says I'm full of shit, and if you is locked in, you stay there till rich or ed turn up and offer you sweet crystal freedom.

Tim Vine is the king of the rapid, staccato, mindfield one liner. Why would that translate into a heavily scripted, bland, tired sit-com format? And even if it did, why adopt such a fucking boring premise.

River Song's an overplayed character. Once a mysterious and wise character who safeguarded so many secrets with a heavy heart and an iron will, River's devolved into this generic gun-toting flirty, sexy cougar that Moffat's pumped out. Virtually all of her intrigue has been drained as we've seen [Series Six SPOILER:](/s ""her birth, her childhood in a Florida orphanage overtaken by Silents, her regeneration in New York, her rebirth as a black toddler, her somehow getting to London, her entire childhood, her other death, her becoming River Song, her first meeting the Doctor, her becoming an archaeologist, her gaining her doctorate, her meeting the Doctor for the last time and her death""). There's really nothing left to tell without feeling superficial. We already know everything that matters about River, so there's really no need to delve deeper. The well's been dried.

And make the Master return? After [Series 4 ""The End of Time"" SPOILER:](/s ""he had such a meaningful departure? He was dying, at the end of his life and chose to spend it throwing Rassilon back into hell with a vengeance""). Bringing him back *again* would just feel incredibly cheap after all that.

true,MisoSoup,lfc50,,"&gt;This is a unique and factual account of Everton's early history, the only downside being it gives equal coverage to our cousin's from the dark side. 

&gt;There are some fantastic black and white photo's from the 1950's including on page 145 a pitch invasion at Stamford Bridge when Everton were the visitors and two middle-aged manic looking spectators complete with long raincoats are about to confront the Everton 'outside-left' Laverick with a view to throttling him.  Who said pitch invasions are a curse of the modern game?

&gt;There is also a full and scripted account of the celebration dinner at the Adelphi Hotel in August 1892 to mark the opening of Goodison Park.  The ground was officially opened by Lord Kinnaird, president of the Football Association, along with Mr G Mahon, president of the club. Interestingly, in his reply to the toast of the club, he stated 'that it was his endeavour to save the game from the taint of rowdyism and betting'.  Sky Sports, watch out!

&gt;I'm sure there would be sufficient interest if anybody decided to publish a re-print of this book.  If you're lucky enough to get hold of a copy then do so; it's the definitive early history of Everton Football Club. — Steve Hogan

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I'm not saying that you're trying to make someone agree. You're persuading. It's like the difference between an argument and a debate. I don't think anyone with any common sense would try or be able to 'bleach the opinion' out of someone. But I also never said that you had umbrage with my opinions. You seem to think that having a difference in values or opinions means that I think you’re overly aggressive or something. But that’s not it. It just means we’re different.

As for the bachelor party, I'm not perceiving inequality in the show and I'm not using fallacy. I was perceiving inequality in your condemnation of Amy's fling (which I do equate with bachelor parties) and Rory's party. Whether or not he chose to have a fling at his party, he could've had one, and that's the point: that both of them had the *opportunity* to have a fling without being condemned for it. The fact that Rory did not take his opportunity doesn't make Amy worse than him. The show itself has no inequality.

Besides the fact that the Doctor told her it would be on time (and see how she trusts him every time) and that it malfunctioned the first two times because it was repairing itself, as you say yourself, her actions make internal sense. She thought that she'd be able to make it to the wedding. She took it into consideration, and with what information/beliefs she had about the TARDIS she went. Because as far as she knew, she'd be back. So her decision is not any more selfish than any other companion.

And as to Rory's homophobia, you misunderstand me. Rory is not afraid of being accused of being gay. But audiences in real life could accuse him. As for promoting it in the show, that was RTD era, and until series 6, Moffat had not done any promotion. And no matter how progressive the show is, that's not going to stop people from lambasting it. Also, yes, Rory looked away out of courtesy, but conversely, had he looked at the Doctor, that could be taken wrongly. 

Vampires of Venice- Yes, there was time for her to tell him. Of course, then you wonder why Amy wouldn't even leave the TARDIS why the Doctor would do all of this. In fact, why would the Doctor do something so silly about something serious? It's irresponsible. Plus, it doesn't make sense. That's very insensitive of the Doctor, and you think, if Amy knew what he was planning, she would've stopped him (whether she was going to tell Rory herself or not)? My own speculation is that the Doctor did all this while Amy was sleeping and cleaning up. He could've landed the TARDIS and planned it all out. While this is no definitive evidence, there is also no evidence to suggest it didn't happen. This is the problem with the off-screen gaps. We have no idea of the circumstances.

I'd like to assume the above about Amy. But if we were to assume that Amy just didn't tell him, or even, didn't *want* to tell him, I don't think I care. I know couples who wouldn't want to know if their spouse had a one night stand, but would want to know if they were having a secret long term relationship. I understand this for reasons we've discussed before. So I'm saying that we have no knowledge of the kind of circumstances Amy was in between scenes, and if she did decide to leave it out, I am fine with it because what Amy did was a mistake. So if you had a spouse, I guess you would want to know about every mistake your significant other made. For me, I don’t care. It would just breed mistrust and anger when it was a mistake. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. It's just my opinions.

And also, for all we know, Amy and Rory had their own 'talk' and apology on Amy's part later between each other in an off screen story/discussion. We don't know if Amy actively hid the truth, just didn't really mention it, or was going to tell him and was beaten to the punch by the Doctor. Again, either way, I don't care.

Astronaut: Besides the fact that, well, how many people happen to be walking in astronaut suits at the site of alien activity that is linked to the Doctor's death which was caused by a person in an astronaut suit, it was not some undetermined point in the future. It was 5:02 PM, 1969, in some month, May was it? Also, you can technically kill someone who you think is going to hurt your friend. You shouldn't, it's wrong, but you could. And you would go to jail for it in this case. My point isn't that it's OK, because murder isn't, but that it's *understandable* under the circumstances. And that I can *forgive* her and not think her a terrible person because of it. Again, my own opinions.

And as for the quote ""This wouldn't be a problem if the Doctor was female.""

I was saying that you would not be condemning Amy's travel with the Doctor, if he was a female. I said this because I think you're creating a romantic relationship between them when there wasn't one. Only the five minute fling. And you wouldn't have condemned her if the Doctor was female because Amy is straight. This isn't me being sexist, this is a logical thought process that isn't ""fallacious"". Don't accuse me of sexism, please.

As for you swapped gender situation, I imagined a guy who looked like Eccleston and a friendly girl like Penny from Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog and the female Doctor from the Fatal Death story. And it works. Don't think that it changes anything. It does sound bad, but just like Amy, you have to look at it under the circumstances. This male-Amy was totally obsessed with the Doctor from his childhood. Plus, when he came onto the female Doctor, he had nearly died, he wasn’t thinking clearly. He made a mistake.

Also, for the ""heinous"" thing. I said that, not you. I asked you for ""heinous examples"" of Amy's deceit. You told me you had provided examples. I said that this is a difference in values, because the examples you provided aren't ones I would consider ""heinous"". Via this thinking, I was to infer that you do believe your examples to fit my request of “heinous examples”.

And for Amy's contacting Rory, I say again that she wouldn't have done that because she thought she would be back at any time. The other companions wanted to call their family because while they could be back anytime (so they thought), they missed their family.  So Amy didn’t miss Rory in the time while she was travelling. Doesn’t mean she’s bad. Besides this, I use the other companions as examples for why her decision to travel isn't selfish. And lastly, that besides Rory she has no other family, since they were eaten by the crack.

My logic is not faulty or ""distorted"" or ""fallacious"". I think that there is a lot of misunderstanding and misinterpreting going on from both sides here. And on your part when it comes to calling me sexist. Really, please stop, it bothers me.",0,1334353314,null,0,false,0,c4bysdt,t3_s1j0m,t1_c4bysdt,t1_c4bw5ve,null,1428716024,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"That's an enormous relief. I was afraid I had come across as pushy or intolerant of your beliefs, of which I mean to be neither. All I want to do is help point out and mend some of the more egregious breaches in logic you've committed, your actual conclusion after that fact really isn't of my concern, and if that endpoint differs from mine there's no real call for me to fault you on it. In fact I feel differing perspectives (if founded on sound logic) are a thing to be celebrated and shared, so you can see by worry that I perhaps came across as intolerant when I really don't wish to be.

&gt; I was perceiving inequality in your condemnation of Amy's fling (which I do equate with bachelor parties) and Rory's party.

Surely you understand that these two situations are vastly different. One is a ceremonial celebration of marriage (and not everyone celebrates it as you presume, as a ""one last fling"". In fact all bachelor parties I've been to have been more a party for the groom's single friends under the guise of giving him a pat on the back than anything else) and the other is running away in the middle of the night with another man. I think one of the key differences is that there's no secrecy in Rory's party, he has shirts made and calls Amy from the bar to tell her he loves her for crying out loud, there's no secrets there while Amy doesn't so much as let him know what she's done, both before and after the event.

&gt; Whether or not he chose to have a fling at his party, he could've had one, and that's the point: that both of them had the opportunity to have a fling without being condemned for it.

Oh come now, this is pure fallacy. Everyone has the opportunity to do anything without others finding out. If I'm away from home and my spouse is as well and I choose to snog some old flame while they don't, does that mean neither of us have committed an unscrupulous act simply because one didn't do it themselves?

Honestly, this is a terrible argument in terms of logic. Firstly you presume that Stag Parties are opportunity for flings (which several of them, most notably Rory's, are not) and that said flings withing them are suddenly impervious to criticism or reprimand and you secondly presume equal amnesty from consequence in Amy's flight. This is an entirely fallacious presumption.

And referring to my first point, it isn't the *opportunity* for unscrupulous action that is being criticized here, but the *choice to execute* said action.

Picture two people on a street corner and on the sidewalk there is a stand, unmanned, that says ""Free Scones"".

One person has the *opportunity* to take all the scones (there is not limit imposed, nor any law set), but one takes just one while the other clears the whole stand.

Now one of those persons has done something selfish while the other has not. Are you to say that I judge both parties equally simply because they had the same opportunity?

On Amy and time-travel, she was *pissed* at the TARDIS's tardiness (hey, that's serendipitous!). It was one of the single most traumatic events of her life, something she never forgot and didn't forgive the Doctor for *for sixteen years*.

And then the Doctor does the same thing to her *again*. Remind you that this is *after* the Doctor claims that the TARDIS has been fixed and works like a charm.

Her *only* memories, her only *concept* of the TARDIS is that of a machine that never arrives on time. It is all she has known it as for the past two years.

She *knew* that the TARDIS is unreliable. She had been given warnings to such in the most personal way possible *twice*.

And yet she didn't think of that and just leapt on without question. That's not thinking. That's being thoughtless and inconsiderate of the *horrifyingly probable* outcome that you are not only late, but *years* late. That's an enormous risk that she just did not care about. A risk that would have surely shattered Rory's heart, but one she simply did not care about.

The Eleventh Hour was made immediately after the RTD era. Literally all anyone had to go on was RTD's past works and Moffat's writings (Moffat, the man who *wrote* Jack's pansexual character in The Empty Child/Doctor Dances and whose other works like Jekyll proudly show homosexual characters). It's a safe bet (an even safer bet with the hindsight of knowing how cool with homosexuality Moffat still is in his run) that homophobia never entered the equation to the slightest degree.

&gt; My own speculation is that the Doctor did all this while Amy was sleeping and cleaning up. He could've landed the TARDIS and planned it all out. While this is no definitive evidence, there is also no evidence to suggest it didn't happen. This is the problem with the off-screen gaps. We have no idea of the circumstances.

I like this theory. And it makes sense too. Although it is odd that although Amy seems indignant about Rory coming along, she doesn't act all that shocked at his presence. In fact, she doesn't really act nearly as emotionally overheated as I would suppose one would facing their fiancee after having snogged another man. Keep in mind that the Doctor has already told Rory that Amy attempted to kiss him.

Perhaps there was an apology, but I fell that would be a vital scene for the rest of the episode's mechanics, if not at the very least a very vital scene in the character's development, and yet it's just ignored. I've always found that aspect of Vampires in Venice to be wholly disappointing and a bit out of place.

&gt; So if you had a spouse, I guess you would want to know about every mistake your significant other made.

Firstly, please don't presume. I mean, we're good friends and all but I hardly think either of us could form accurate suppositions of the opposing party's marital lives.

Secondly, I've got no problem with letting mistakes lie dormant. No one wants to drudge up every little mistake they've made over their lives like that time I nearly ran over a brigade of cheerleaders with a van during a parade just as we were in front of the Governor (among my single biggest and most embarrassing mistakes in my life). Some things should just be considered as irrelevant mistakes no one intended for and realize there's no point on dwelling on them.

But Amy running off with the Doctor and then snogging him was no ""mistake"". A bad move, one that she regrets, sure. But it was a move that she deliberately *chose* to make. One that's fresh, one that actually involves Rory because it's an action that's important to their relationship. This wasn't something like the time I shunned the attempted friendship of a kid in my freshman art class and then found out that his father had a heart attack and fell down a flight of stairs to his death just a month later, and then Tyler himself died in a car crash on Christmas of just last year. Those are just terribly painful, painful regrets that are pointless to keep bringing up, but this is a pertinent issue, one that's still relevant right then.

&gt; It was 5:02 PM, 1969, in some month, May was it?

No, remember that Amy and Rory travel to Utah by plane and that Canton Everett Delaware III was there as an old man. The Doctor dies not in 1969 but in the present, some thirty-odd years *after* their encounter with the Astronaut. Key mistake you've made there.

Didn't call you sexist. As you said (and as I stated) I was just pointing out a logical fallacy you were making. As you said ""I'm not sexist, I made an error in logic."" I'me merely pointing out that error.

Similarly there *was* sexual attraction to the Doctor from Amy. You can see it *very* clearly through out the Eleventh Hour, and the most potent case of this is her deliberate choice to voyeuristically watch him undress. If you were to negate that you would not be making parallel, you would be massively altering the dynamic of the situation to serve a point you're trying to make.

Oh, then the ""heinous"" thing was simply a miscommunication. I find much of Amy's actions to be unscrupulous, thoughtless, immature, self-serving, and inconsiderate but I really can't say that it's ""heinous"" (except, again, the murdering bit).

If you love someone, even if you know you can go back to them at any time, you do miss them when you go through days without them. If you really love someone and you're suddenly away from them you do start to miss them, no matter how much fun you're having and *especially* if you're burgeoning pre-newlyweds.

If she has no family, then that would seemingly increase her thoughts for Rory *more*. He's all the family she's got, and yet she doesn't miss him throughout *any* of the Doctor's adventures with her. That's pretty self-centered and careless of those who care about you, to not even in passing reciprocate a similar desire to be with them.

You've made quite a few mistakes, at least you can admit so much. And a lot of your stances are propped up less on opinion and more on said faulty logic designed to vindicate opinion.

Really you're asking so many different things with so many different flavors for answers. You're asking several things:

You're asking how we feel about the show's current artistic direction, it's standard and themes of writing, it's acting, it's direction, it's characterization of the companions, and the acting capabilities of said companions.

To keep it brief I'll say that I'm no real fan of how they're handling the focus on Amy and Rory and leave it at that. Although I personally can conceive a Doctor Who in which the Doctor shares screentime with equally engaging and interesting partners (and many Classic stories are able to incorporate this to some degree).

But the one thing I have to disagree with you on is the score. Fully orchestrated, higher throwbacks to the classic theremin sound, bolder use of the brass section.

AFAIK no.

&gt;Because TfL not running their ad campaign is no more a free speech issue than me not inviting in some Jehovah's witnesses for a chat.

TfL is a public run organisation though, and hence this would ammount to the goverment (local/national) prohibiting certain forms of advertisement based on content. This is censorship.

Personally I'm of the mind that the government shouldn't be using advertising as sponsorship. I'm all for private organisations accepting or refusing advertisements as they please.

It was thought up, not to ""*extend the war*"" as some people think (who read a single Cracked article), but to finish it. The thinking was, Russia will ally itself with Japan - Russia, will then use the twin might of Japan/Russia to attack Poland and all the other countries Hitler had just left. World War II wasn't over, WWII in Europe was. Russia was a very very real threat. This was before Hiroshima et al, so the war was still on. 

As time has gone on, Operation Unthinkable has become a way to go ""well churchill was great... but still a tory.."" when really, in context, it was a risky yet very much needed contigency plan. The whole story has been moved from it's time and into a ""the war was over, everything was fine Churchill just wanted to fight for-fucking-ever"" which it really wasn't that.

 Seeing as you seem to give a shit I'll direct you to the 'Ontological argument for the existance of God'.  Just wiki it I guess - I'm not going to rattle it all off, there's nothing but downvotes to be had for a man that is willing to humour anything but stringently documented scientific theory in this community.  Just look it up.  And a word of advice (the first paragraph of a wiki article is unlikely to educate you on depth and history of an argument that has been evolving for hundreds of years).  Although tbh, you seem like a reasonable man that doesn't need reminding.    

 I'll say again, I'm not a religious man, but it really does get my back up when legions of 18 year old American physics students dig their heels in and fight tooth and nail for a point of view in just the same way as every other bigotted arsehole on the planet.  It's just a shame really.  I always assumed 'truth' was the destination - most the time the destination actually seems to be 'fight for the side that is currently winning', or rather 'fight for the opinion that has the most follows in the community you are currently in'.  Such a sharade.  What we know changes so often, and what we know is changing faster now than at any other point in history.  I think one of the biggest mistakes we make is to teach people that we must have clear cut and strong opinion on everything, even things you cannot possibly know the answer to.  If you don't have and opinion, if you're not 'on a side', then you must be an idiot, or lazy, scared.  And then people wonder why everyone is pissing everyone else off.  

 You seem like you may also enjoy this:  The problem of induciton.  It's a theory that prety much pulls the rug from under scientific theory, and the only ingredient, is reason.  There is perfectly logical method to totally unhinge science.  A lot of people onn reddit would take this as some heinous and unfounded attack on science.  I just think it's funny.  How weird that the epitome of logical knowledge consolidation can be silenced by it's own methods.  

 I feel I should say again - I am not religious - I enjoy science very much and have huge respect for it.  But it really isn't a black and white issue as people believe.  People want it to be simple, but it isn't - and y'know what.  That's just awesome.

I also had two more friends working lesser kitchen jobs (kitchen porters). It took them 2 and 6 weeks to find their jobs (about 3 years ago).

One guy who has already used the ""come back from death free"" card over and over again. 

And in The End of Time we have a definitive end for him, his life-long obsession coming to a close and as he degenerates to skeletal nothingness he forces Rassilon and the Time Lords back into the hell from which they came.

true,HydraCarbon,null,null,"You probably wouldn't be the main character in either. It's just a numbers game. So you just have to go off of the general universe. I've never watched Doctor Who, but I understand it to basically be this universe, with a dude who can kinda deal with the timey wimey stuff. So your life would probably be an average citizen in an average place.

In the Star Wars universe, however, if you were an average person in an average place, it would seem you are basically fucked. Warring factions controlling the entire galaxy, the possibility of just being vapor seems pretty high. I may be oversimplifying and only remembering the homes of the main characters, but I just don't remember too many people being in a reasonable situation for too long.

So either way, your life would probably be defined by a major war, be it intergalactic or a world/civil war involving your homeland. I think I'd choose what I know at least a little better, so I'd go with Who.

If I could pick any universe, it would probably be Pokemon. I could live with being a shopowner, a daycare worker, whatever. I'd probably be able to mass up a decent group of pokemon, but be blissfully ignorant to the injustices around me and how to use type advantage. A nice, simple, cute life where a 10 year old boy has saved me countless times but nobody even recognizes him. Celebrity doesn't really exist, so that's cool. The downside would occur if I missed the timing a little and took part in whatever wiped out every man who wasn't a scientist or a war hero. Some shit obviously went down.

If I must have a second option, I would probably go with the universe of the Big Bang Theory. My world would be essentially the same but that show would have never aired.

Each Doctor is so different from the one previous there is bound to be things that rub you the wrong way. I feel the new show's budget provides more options for things they can do and because of that maybe Moffat has went a bit crazy with power. Having said all that, there is much I like about the Moffat/11th run so far. I feel the average episode is better written. No more Aliens of London or The Idiot's Lantern garbage. Matt Smith is a fine actor who can show the inherent sadness of the Doctor one moment, and lead into the fun and flamboyant Doctor soon after. They have really built the characters of the companions on this run more than any previous. I am glad to know that they are leaving after or during this season to hand it off to a new companion.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I'll just give you the usual induction :)

Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like.
Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1334378474,null,0,false,0,c4c37ip,t3_s93d2,t1_c4c37ip,t3_s93d2,null,1428718114,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

I think the Star Wars universe offers the best choice since even if you're an average person it would still be amazing. Alien life, interplanetary FTL travel, subservient droids.

Even in a worse case scenario, you grow up as a moisture farmer on an outer rim desert planet, dreaming of the possibilities that await when you can finally afford to get off-world. One day, while chasing down a particularly feisty wayward droid, you linger too long while investigating a small party of tusken raiders. One of them catches you off-guard, and, bashing in your skull, prematurely ends the life you had hoped would one day be filled with adventure on distant worlds.

true,spacegirl8,null,null,"I think many people are misunderstanding the implications of this ruling. Abu Hamza is the most famous of the cases. He has been charged with inciting murder and racial hatred in the UK. However, all of the other people facing extradition have been incarcerated without charge, in the cases of Talha Ahsan: 5 years, and Babar Ahmad for 8 years - the longest in British history, and a hugely significant breech of human rights in itself. Their individual cases differ from that of Abu Hamza's and have more in common with Richard O'Dwyer in that their accusations are website related. 

People have not recognised that this ruling opens the door for the extradition of Julian Assange from Europe to the US. Abu Hamza is an easy figure for people to hate, and I think he has been used as a cover, diverting people's attentions away from a situation where people only have to express viewpoints distasteful to the authorities, to be held indefinitely in prison without trial, before extradition.

Here are some articles which explain what I am trying to say more eloquently:

My family were upper middle class all throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th century and each person lived to about, on average, 60ish I would say.

As a whole too, my family didn't exactly drink heavy on the alcohol, sure some wine here and there, whisky too, but not downing the stuff, nor did they smoke, and also ate proper, decent meals (got quite a few silver fish knifes and forks), and drank tea...xD

But anyway, I've rambled on. You're right, it is a common misconception. Queen Victoria lived to be 81; King William IV, 71; King George IV, 67; all those were people who lived in fantastic, clean, healthy conditions. The poor in their disease ridden, cramped, damp conditions with someone little food to have will have definitely died sooner, regardless if they drank or not.

true,spacegirl8,null,null,"I think many people are misunderstanding the implications of this ruling. Abu Hamza is the most famous of the cases. He has been charged with inciting murder and racial hatred in the UK. However, all of the other people facing extradition have been incarcerated without charge, in the cases of Talha Ahsan: 5 years, and Babar Ahmad for 8 years - the longest in British history, and a hugely significant breech of human rights in itself. Their individual cases differ from that of Abu Hamza's and have more in common with Richard O'Dwyer in that their accusations are website related. 

People have not recognised that this ruling opens the door for the extradition of Julian Assange from Europe to the US. Abu Hamza is an easy figure for people to hate, and I think he has been used as a cover, diverting people's attentions away from a situation where people only have to express viewpoints distasteful to the authorities, to be held indefinitely in prison without trial, before extradition.

Here are some articles which explain what I am trying to say more eloquently:

While people are free to do as they choose (to an extent) something that the ""pray the gay away"" groups never seem to address or acknowledge is why people are uncomfortable being gay in the first place. It's a circular (sort of Catch22) scenario. If we're talking about religious homosexuals - they feel uncomfortable or unhappy because their religion teaches (often) that homosexuality is wrong or 'sinful'. The reason they're sad is because their faith frowns on it and fellow religious people are often homophobic (to an extent).

As such the argument ""We're just helping people who are unhappy!"" is ignoring the fact that groups such as this are making those people unhappy in the first place! Similar to (can't think of a better analogy) ""Dammit the kid is unhappy again, moping about the place. I'd better beat him until he cheers up."" It should be obvious why the child is unhappy in that situation.

You might have heard anti-homosexual groups point out that gays, lesbians or transgender people tend to have higher rates of depression and suicide than heterosexuals and non-trans people. They cite their ""sexual deviance"" as being the reason for their depression, when in reality it is the lack of support or rather the anti-gay (etc.) resistance from many people that cause the problem. Like smacking a homosexual in the face and then saying ""Look! Being gay results in a bleeding nose.

It was incredibly cheap when I first moved here (semi-)permanently around the turn of the millennium, although it's increased dramatically since globalization caught up with this part of the world and Vietnam signed ""free"" trade deals with the WTO etc. (and inflation remains worrisome).  It's still not at all bad generally - [here's a CoL index of countres](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp) and Vietnam is still well towards the very cheaper end, but it's more than a tad misleading - central HCM prices are ridiculously inflated by the influx of international investment and corporate activity.

&gt;And why do you live/work in vietnam?

Why not?  The West was becoming uniform, ugly and unfree.  I was running away from global capitalism and, at the time, _the Economist_ had called Vietnam ""beyond capitalism"".

It didn't.

Cartoons like Ren &amp; Stimpy, Spongebob, Flapjack, Adventure Time, et al, are parodies of an adult reality.  They are engrossing because you are able to see the wit and the eccentricities of the story-writers, while not having to tense up if you're in a room of mixed company.  They're safe to watch.  They hit on mature themes every so often in a non-threatening way.

It's fascinating to see how they pull punches while still letting you know where they were aiming them.  I do not even watch these shows religiously either, but I appreciate them.

MLP, on the other hand, is flat.  It does not even pretend to be layered.  If you want television promoting family values, friendship, kindness, loyalty, honesty, etc, there are other programs available that deliver these messages much better and also offer more than that.  I do not understand the religious following of MLP, other than to say these people have been duped into liking a show because they think it's the new, hip thing.

But that's wordtobigbid's problem as he originally stated that - whether he can come up with one *for* secularism is another matter entirely!

However, just in case anyone was wondering: a secularism system doesn't (or shouldn't) 'exclude' religion as such, but rather it does not treat the religious angle as any more valid or important than other argued or stated positions i.e. An MP proposing a law or amendment that is coming from a religious point of view must convince that that position is worthy of implementation, based on other factors.. An example of how the reverse happens at the moment, one might take a look at various votes lead by Bishops in the Lords over the last few years.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The US didn't start with two directly elected chambers. The House of Reps was always directly elected but the Senate was created with the purpose of being a voice for the state governments. This is why the Senate has 2 members for every state regardless of population.

The senators could be chosen by the state government in what ever manner that state saw fit. However this lead to a lot of cronyism and corruption so the constitution was amended to state that senators too should be directly elected. This is to a degree what has caused the stalemate of American politics.

The point of House of Lords reform (which I assume you're talking about) is that the House of Lords just now isn't answerable to anyone. Members are either Life Peers who are appointed by one of the three major parties with almost no clarity as to why or how they were selected, 'elected life peers' who are elected by those who used to be entitled to a heriditary peerage and bishops of the church of England.

I think that there isn't really any justification for having a body of like this with influence over government policy. I think that to hold poer in a democracy you should have a mandate from the people, so i favour elections.
 
Furthermore, if the Lords Reform Bill passes and the lords becomes (mostly) elected by STV I think it would be very healthy for democracy in the UK. The Commons is elected using a meathod that is very unrepresentative of parties that do not have their suppor concentrated. if the Lords were a PR chamber it would mean that the Greens, UKIP, the Lib Dems and yes the BNP would at least have some voice in government. Such a system would also make the creation of parties much more vaible (whch I'd support because the selection we have now is pretty grim).

It's important to not that one of the reasons that opponents of lords reform give is that an elections to the lords would give the chamber legitimacy and so would threaten the primacy of the commons. This can be broken down as saying that a chmebr which did more fully represent the population would undermine the unrepresentative commons. I suspect that many MPs who oppose reform agree that a chamber truly representative of the population would render the other one pointless, and that they do not want to see the commons rendered pointless.",0,1334417415,null,0,false,0,c4c6xm7,t3_s9frq,t1_c4c6xm7,t3_s9frq,null,1428719930,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

Well, that's a much debated point.  First we had the ""wisdom of crowds"" thesis, then the contrary position was posited and voters (for example) were viewed as irrational and now the evidence seems to be [switching back the other way](http://reason.com/blog/2009/07/19/the-madness-of-crowds-is-an-ex).  Nonetheless, you either allow a power hungry minority to to take that power and do as they have always done - to make decisions in their own interests, or you trust that the majority of people are similar to yourself and will behave better the more freedom you afford to them.  If I don't trust people in general to exert their own individual power, why on earth would I trust a small minority who actively seek power to have the entire nation's power at their disposal?

&gt;For example, in California, the state has had many financial problems due to people being incredibly short sighted and blindly vote for populist propositions, e.g. Limiting property tax and subsequently making it hard to pass new budgets and taxes while simultaneously voting for increased spending in Education, Policing etc.

This is a very specific and limited example.  There are many many problems with California's model of direct democracy.  I think even DD's fiercest proponents would acknowledge that.",0,1334418015,null,0,false,0,c4c712z,t3_s9c7t,t1_c4c712z,t1_c4c6vod,null,1435721073,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"&gt;Alexander Boot

&gt;Boris Johnson is a long-standing champion of sexual tolerance – at least that’s what he seems to expect from his poor wife.

&gt;This time he has shifted his innermost convictions into the public arena by banning from London buses a Christian campaign aimed at reforming homosexuals.

&gt;‘London is one of the most tolerant cities in the world and intolerant of intolerance,’ he said. I agree.

&gt;London is so tolerant it could be twinned with Sodom – or alternatively with our neighbourhood French villages called Orgy and Anus (I’m not joking, they are both next door to us).

&gt;True to his word, the good mayor found nothing wrong with the blatant propaganda of homosexuality launched earlier by Stonewall, the charity devoted to promoting homosexual agendas, such as same-sex marriage.

&gt;The thrust of their campaign was the probably correct message that homosexuality is innate and therefore irreversible.

&gt;In response, Christian groups created a campaign typified by the ad saying ‘Some people are gay. Get over it.’ That’s where Mr Johnson drew the line on his tolerance.

&gt;‘It is clearly offensive,’ he thundered, ‘to suggest that being gay is an illness that someone recovers from and I am not prepared to have that suggestion driven around London on our buses.'

&gt;Our erudite mayor is a writer, but he’s clearly not a reader. For anyone who actually read the ad would know it says nothing of the sort. Any reasonably educated person will be aware that homosexuality isn’t a disease. It is, however, an aberration.

&gt;Now before I’m tarred and feathered as yet another manifestation of the prevailing tolerance, I hasten to add that I use the word ‘aberration’ strictly in its dictionary definition: ‘a departure from what is normal or desirable’.

&gt;Since only about one percent of us are that way inclined, homosexuality is obviously a departure from the norm. Surely, 99 percent are in a better position than one percent to judge what is normal?

&gt;And, indulging in a bit of reductio ad absurdum, reversing that proportion would spell the end of the human race, which is clearly undesirable. So the dictionary definition applies in its entirety.

&gt;It may well be true that a propensity for homosexual, which is to say aberrant, behaviour is innate.

&gt;And it’s indisputable that people ought not to be reproached, much less punished, for the way they are born. They can, however, be legitimately asked not to act on their aberrant tendencies.

&gt;A kleptomaniac only becomes reproachable when he actually steals. A man who’s violent by nature is on safe grounds until he commits a violent act. We aren’t responsible for where we begin in life. But we are responsible for where we finish.
Boris Johnson was said to have intervened himself as chair of TfL when he became aware of the controversial campaign, which mimicked a previous Stonewall initiative .

&gt;The campaign that offended the Mayor enunciates the traditional Christian attitude to homosexuality. Rather than regarding homosexuality as a disease from which one could be cured, Christianity regards it as a sin from which one should abstain. It’s only in this sense that a homosexual can ‘get over it’.

&gt;Abstaining from sex for moral reasons is tantamount to heroism, and most people can’t be expected to be heroes. That’s why I don’t think homosexuality should be banned, or homosexuals in any way abused.

&gt;But Christianity would be remiss in its mission if it didn’t call on them to adhere to the absolute moral standards stipulated by the founding religion of our civilisation.

&gt;And all of us, Christians or otherwise, ought to be wary of the systematic campaign to destroy everything our civilisation stands for.

&gt;It’s not only our religion but also our constitution, our aesthetic sense, our education and our general morality that are being smashed by the battering ram of PC modernity.

&gt;That propaganda of homosexuality can be used in this capacity is beyond question. Witness the fact that the first European country that liberalised homosexuality was Soviet Russia between 1917 and 1934 – neither the time nor the place known for an all-consuming love of Western civilisation.

&gt;In parallel, the Bolsheviks, who were almost as tolerant as Mayor Johnson, abolished marriage, and Lenin’s mistress Inessa Armand likened sex to drinking a glass of water.

&gt;The Bolsheviks were aware of the destructive potential of sexual licentiousness in all its forms, and they were out to destroy.

&gt;Boris Johnson doesn’t want to destroy. He just wants to be re-elected – as a Conservative (!) candidate.

&gt;To establish his conservative credentials, he is flaunting his moral relativism, what he calls intolerance of intolerance.

&gt;In doing so he denies the right of free speech to a constructive campaign asking homosexuals to reform and suggesting it’s possible – while affording this freedom to a campaign that’s utterly deterministic and destructive, in effect if not in intent.

&gt;I’m willing to accept for the sake of argument (and only for its sake) that, rather than simply indulging in full-time electioneering, Mr Johnson really does disagree with the sentiment expressed in the ‘Get over it’ campaign.

&gt;But that’s no reason to ban it. For freedom of speech to mean anything at all, it ought to cover the freedom to say things we don’t like. After all, allowing only those statements that please us involves no hardship at all.

&gt;Judging by his action, Boris Johnson is rather vague on our constitutional liberties, Western moral and intellectual tradition, and the boundaries of his remit as a politician.

&gt;His response to what the ads actually say also betokens a need for a remedial reading class. An ideal future candidate for Prime Minister, I dare say.

Granted, although the current state of politics and politicians is somewhat questionable, the wisdom of the population, given enough emotional encouragement, is even more so (an example of which being the petrol panic buying).

&gt;This is a very specific and limited example. There are many many problems with California's model of direct democracy. I think even DD's fiercest proponents would acknowledge that.

I concede it was quite specific and may not really apply to the UK, but the general idea of short shortsightedness still applies.

On the subject of excluding religion - We have to look at the system already in place. I don't think anyone can argue that religion at present is marginalised in the UK particularly in parliament/government, or that it has ever been really. Not with our current system. In fact religion - or rather one particular branch of Christianity - enjoys privilege not afforded to any other group: First, before every parliamentary session (I believe) there are (Christian) prayers held. Second, there are 26 *men* who have positions in the Lords on the virtue that they hold high office in the Anglican church. No other reason - they don't have to have any particular qualification to be given those seats, save for some internal process in the CoE.

Removing these 26 from the Lords, or prayers from either chamber etc., removes some overtly religious anachronisms from parliament. But it does not *exclude* religion. There's no law in place, nor should there be, that states: ""A member of religion X cannot be voted as member of parliament or ennobled"". No-one is excluded from government due to their religion, so far as I know.

Many of the Lords are Christian. Many MPs are Christian. Some MPs and Lords adhere to other religions. They are not excluded from debate or law making. Their personal views surely have an impact on how they think and vote. If they are to raise a particular issue then it is generally, at present, thought about and debated from numerous points of view particularly in the lower chamber - the fact that their motivation might be religious is, to a degree, irrelevant. Look at Dorries - Anyone who knows anything about her and the issues she raises *knows* that she's being backed by Christian groups. There's documentary proof! But her amendments are weighed against evidence (and usually found wanting). In the Lords, however, the Bishops have managed to [shut down debates in the past by raising their flag](http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/01/secularism-and-the-assisted-dying-debate) (4th para.) on the comparatively rare occasions they show up to vote. They have a power which I would say no other group enjoys.

Removing overt religion from government will not *exclude* religion from parliament, rather it will ensure that any historical privilege is removed and all groups are given an equal footing.

Sure.  Although I think the two things are related, and the debate on voting rationality and crowd behaviour more generally still rages.  At one level, it's the old human nature debate: are we good people twisted bad by a corrupt system, or are we bad people kept caged by the necessary constraints of society?  Competition and violence versus mutual aid and cooperation.  I'm firmly in the Rousseau camp, others believe Hobbes had the right of it.  But what's interesting is that few people apply the Hobbesian worldview to themselves - they don't view themselves as vicious, brutish, over-emotional, irrational beings, just all the others they don't know.  It's the anonymous crowd which is scary.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Bravo, sir.

 I would worry that excluding religion entirely in one foul swoop would not be the answer.  Change, when concerned with things of this nature, is best to be done gradually.  I think the best way about this would be just to make sure no extra power is granted at any point, and simply allow the slow degeneration of Christianity - that is already in motion as far as I am concerned - to do the rest.  

 It will of course sound like I may be 'siding with *them*', but I think it is simply an historical fact that Christianity has played a huge part in the construction of our society as it is now - It is not a case of whether this was a good, or a bad thing, it is simply the case.  I think rubbishing something so suddenly is just never the answer.  Rapid change in society is a recipe for the spread of mistrust in the state and general disorder and a 'non-clarity' as to what people are meant to be doing/how they are meant to be acting (you may disagree here, and argue that man is entirely rational when left to his own devices - i would not entirely disagree - that is to say, I do not entirely agree either - I think to assume things of this nature when your desire is to castrate power structures that have existed for centuries, would actually be naive - again, you *may* believe this, you may not).    

 I do think that in time the genuine truth value of what Christianity preaches will be shown to be what it is, false, it is essentially a mythology (and quite frankly that is really no big deal to anyone who has had the privilege of consideration of this point) - but I think there is a real danger behind that being unveiled in a dramatic and rapid fashion.  Mythologies are used as a tool not just to oppress, but also to teach, they can be a method to help people understand the world around them, and they're place in it - not everybody is receptive to raw, dry factual data accumulated by the sciences.  And there of course is the enduring question of meaning.  Science, due to it's very nature, will never be able to step up and tackle the question of *meaning* of/for man.  

 I like you, I like your style, and I think you're exactly the type of person that may need to be reminded very occasionally - that it is unlikely that anyone has in fact 'got it right'.

It's important that one house has the final say in matters (usually the lower house), aka more powerful.

Then at 1:40 we get this entirely different theme with the strings. It's got this subdued energy that gradually builds in this elegant but fun way that just feels so sweeping.

Then at 2:48 we get a much lower taste of the horns giving this melody that brings to mind a widespanning trek through space that marries with the strings.

Then at 3:22 we get this powerful and deep rendition of the Doctor melody, with a strong heartbeat that drops with a powerful weight and builds into this epic crescendo.

Then at 3:58 we get this sudden swing into vocals and a tinkling piano that implies a distant and magical waltz among the stars.

What difference is that? Churches/Temples serve a purpose, and are part of a working organisiation, plus they own it. And if asking the government or the public for money is an issue, better close all charities down then. It's not as if churches do anything for their communities at all.

Many houses sit dormant. Many offices sit dormant. There are literally thousand of shops that now lie dormant. Bulldoze the lot of them too? Hell, there's a few remnents of a castle not far from my house. We don't need castles anymore do we? You could fit a couple of houses there.

&gt;Bulldoze them, and do something more worthwhile with the land, like building new housing, homeless shelters, youth centres, libraries and other USEFUL things

Should a person be expected to enter a potentially irrevocable plea (it's only changeable at the whim of the Court) without access to the full evidence against them, even if subsequent evidence might be fatally damaging to the prosecution case?  How is a defence counsel supposed to prepare a case and know which witnesses s/he requires when s/he might never have had the opportunity to review their statements?  In your comment above and the original one, you appear to be assuming the only thing which matters are the ""feelings"" of guilt of the defendant, but feeling guilty and being guilty in law are clearly not the same thing.

There are any number of reasons for this - not understanding the law is merely the most obvious.

The point really is that The Doctor, The Widow, and the Wardrobe was *very* expensive to produce. And the episode went over *exceedingly* poorly, resulting in a significant loss for the BBC. That was really the key motivating factor.

Yes, the Series will remain the same length, but the year's production of episodes was drastically lowered to recoup cost.

And there are a great host of ""children's shows"" that receive consistently high ratings. If renaissance-era Disney and Pixar have taught storymakers anything it's that quality has no demographic. Saying that it's for children does not excuse poor quality or low reviews.

Also, Doctor Who is categorized as a *family* show by the BBC and not, as you say, a children's show.

Amy only was ever in danger when she walked out of her safe zone. She was in control from the point that she found out where she could go to be safe. And as I remember (seeing as I just watched it, I remember quite well) she found that out on the first day.
