Where abouts in Poland are you?  I've visited Krakow, and work with a colleague who lives in Warsaw.  I found it a really nice place.

[Manchester (my home town) is currently seen as a burgeoning location for graphic design](http://www.buzznorthwest.co.uk/manchesters-booming-digital-and-creative-sectors-should-encourage-exporters/#.UD-TE5Zv9Cg), and is considerably cheaper than our capital.

We have a pretty good and ingrained Polish community - more *Polski Skleps* than you'd think ;)  As a lot of other people have stated, the anti-eastern-european vibe has faded over the last few years.  A large part of this, I believe, is that hundreds of thousands of Poles went home during the recession to find a better life back home!

There's plenty of data round the savaging of apprentice schemes simply because small companies aren't able to sustain them in the current climate. 

It may be an age thing, but I do find myself increasingly feeling as though working to earn money is positive. In a society where more than a third of girls under the age of 14 genuinely believe ""model"" is a viable career option, I tend to the view that encouraging the young to exchange labour for recompense is a ""good thing"". This doesn't in any way detract from the numerous and detailed examples where this broad stroke approach is wrong, but sadly that's what governments tend to have to do: play a numbers game and try to introduce the soilution which will benefit the largest number of people. 

Obviously the Tesco exmaple is a bad one, although as I recall we've already had that scandal this year. It seems unlikely that they're going to go down that road again after the fuss the Guardian et al made last time. If they do, I'm happy to be proved wrong. But off the top of my head there are more than 300,000 registered charities in the UK, and it shouldn't be beyond the wit of even Boris to find a few thousand of them in London that could do with some help. 

The liberal in us will react by saying it's blackmail for benefits, and I can see the argument. This is the sort of thing major corporations, with the connivance of politicians (on both sides, sadly) have taken advantage of in the past. If we take it at face value, though - which we have to do until we have more info - then the argument that doing something, rather than doing nothing is a good thing has to be the outcome.

true,teaprincess,eng-Eastanglia,A country bumpkin in the Big Smoke,"&gt; Yeah, it's awful when I'm in foreign lands and women are fawning all over me because of my British accent ;)

People do it to me, too and it's good for the ego, of course... but there are positives and negatives. They seem to have this image in their head of a prim, proper ""city princess"" because of my accent and education but they don't realise that I have a crude sense of humour sometimes and that I like to just relax and have fun like everybody else. If they pursued a relationship with me because of a stereotype they would be pretty disappointed.

I'm in a long-term relationship with a non-British guy, but he hasn't really ever made a big deal of me being from England. He understands that I'm just a human being. I am moving to his country to be with him eventually, so I guess I will continue to face the experience of being ""that British chick"" for a while yet...

&gt; I can only think of one person who got on my nerves, similar thing to you ""oh that's so British"", but she was just an annoying person. I think she'd have pissed me off if I was British or not.

Yeah, the girl I am talking about in the OP was much the same. I could write an entire book about how fucked up she is. She did it with other people as well, such as my friend of Pakistani/Indian descent ""omg you look so *Indian* today!"" ""it's because you're brown"" (when something bad happened to her.)

Initially, I enjoyed the reaction and I still do when it doesn't get creepy and repetitive. That's why I have such mixed feelings about it - even some of my closest friends are fanatical about British things but they aren't retarded about it.

&gt; Offloading Carroll key to Rodgers rebuilding

&gt;Brendan Rodgers wants Andy Carroll to accept that his career at Anfield is over as the Liverpool manager tries to cash in on the out-of-favour forward to step up his interest in Theo Walcott and Clint Dempsey.

Charlie Adam looks set to join Stoke City while Jay Spearing will leave on loan, with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bolton Wanderers interested in the midfielder. Those deals will free up the funds for Liverpool to reignite their interest in Dempsey, having previously ruled out a move for the American, 29, because of his age and Fulham’s £10 million…",0,1346350901,null,0,false,0,c611ycf,t3_z37fr,t1_c611ycf,t1_c611s39,null,1429775515,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Anyway, I'm feeling slightly less nervous, so here're my slightly less sad thoughts:   
I was planning an away game, so I'd be glad to visit the Bernabeu, it's a beautiful stadium. But the Amsterdam Arena is so tempting.. [Oh well](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqz9k71fNG1qhqc6no1_250.gif).    
Judging from last year, we'll do great at home, I'm hoping for 7-9 home points, which would be fantastic. Away, we're not so great, but we've improved, so I'm hoping for a good 4-6 points, knowing that the RM game away will be **really** hard to draw, not even thinking of a win there.     
BVB didn't really impress last year in an easier group, and looking at them now, with a slightly different team, knowing the lost midfielders and brought in strikers, they might be a harder opponent than last year.   
Ajax has always been a great match, home or away, they're good, and they're tearing apart the Eredivisie so far, last year they beat our neighbours (who have a really hard group again), so I'm looking forward to seeing how this year's CL unfolds.

A lot depends on other teams, and quite a few of our direct competitors are in periods of transition. On the other hand I believe we are on the way out of a transitional period, with the new additions this summer being incremental changes that are just tweaking things that were already there. For example, last night showed that we are now capable of fielding 3 interchangeable attacking midfielders behind the striker, something that really adds the edge to out 4-2-3-1. 

However, an injury crisis would really take its toll on us, so hopefully the couple of loanees that are rumoured to be coming in tommorrow will bulk out our squad. If we show the consistency that we showed during the latter half of last season all the way through, we'll have a real chance of ending the season somewhere special. I also think we have a realistic shot at the cups, as not only are we hard to beat, but now have that killer instinct that will really give us the edge in knockout games.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As a general rule of thumb, anything over 16 hours of study is going to lose you benefits, same as it does with 16 hours of work. However the hours cannot conflict with work, and you must be willing to quit the course for a job.

Take a look at [chapter 30 of the DMG](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/dmgch30.pdf), page 39 onwards deals with eligibility of FT students, and everything rests on the way they define full-time study, so it's worth reading the definition from p33 onwards.

Anything that doesn't fit the definition would be classed as P/T, for which they state:

&gt; P/T student means a person who is attending or undertaking a course of study,
&gt; who is not a F/T student. Such a person may be able to claim benefit if they are    
&gt; 1. a prescribed category of person , for IS see DMG Chapter 20 or    
&gt; 2. **available for employment** , for JSA see DMG Chapter 21.    

[Chapter 21](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/dmgch21.pdf), page 73 onwards deals with P/T students in depth, specifically:

&gt; Claimants may follow P/T study or training during their pattern of availability. They are available if they are willing and able to   
&gt; 1.	 confine their study or training to times that would fit in with any employment
they might obtain or    
&gt; 2.	 abandon their study or training at once to take up employment.   

But it goes on to list a ton of other considerations, so it's worth reading.

eta: just to add that the above applies only to study within your 'pattern of availability', which is the hours you agree to with the JSA. It goes on to say: 

&gt;  If claimants are undertaking study or training at times that are outside of their pattern of availability no question on availability arises (see DMG 21434) .

And hitting the ball up to the big man as a strategy needs every bit as much preparation and training as passing the ball. We were shit at it when Crouch was our big man, and didn't exactly do well last season either. Not Carroll's fault: I think he's the best target man I've seen since Les Ferdinand, possibly the best in the world and still young and likely to improve. But last season, the *only* player we had who seemed to know how to play off a target man was Bellamy, and he's gone.

To use Carroll as a plan B would mean taking a lot of time away from training for plan A, and that just doesn't make sense.

I believe we shouldn't have a plan B, but rather a responsive plan A. Things not going well? Stick to the passing game, but make changes to open up space in different parts of the pitch. Make the front 3 wide or narrow, have the full backs cut in or overlap.

1) Suarez's shirt ""Be Strong Lucas"" was class. So glad he scored today.

2) Reina has been in bad form for a while now.  I know its early days but lining up a replacement may be needed next summer.

3) The Downing left back experiment doesn't seem to be working. He is alright in the attack but I feel like we really lack defensively because he doesn't come back quickly.  

4) Steive still tries to start something too quickly, often giving the ball right back to the opposition.  He showed he is still a great player, he just doesn't quite fit the system.

Reina - nothing major to talk about apart from the goal. For me this was the final straw, and we need to seriously start to look into someone to challenge for his spot. Not take his spot mind, just give him incentive to be at the top of his game, or face being dropped.

Sktel/Carrah - pretty solid nothing to complain about

Downing - Caught out of position a few times, there was a long portion of the first half were we couldnt get out of that left corner of the pitch because he kept fucking up. Otherwise did as well as to be expected given hes a LM.

Shelvey - admiring his passes too much, not moving into space after he passes, otherwise good performance.

Allen - Excellent again

Henderson - Started lively, good passing and energy 

Gerrard - Average game for the skipper

Suarez- very poor, trying to run through players far too much, just play it simple and he'd benefit the team more. Took his goal well and rescued us though.

Morgan - Thrown in at the deep end, looked overwhelmed but did okay considering

The Ref- Fucking awful, the amount of clear fouls we (liverpool) got away with right under his nose was shocking. If the tables were turned, id be fuming.

true,goodguysteve,null,null,"Pros: Although he had a shaky start Morgan really settled in and almost grabbed himself a goal. Definitely one for the future.



Some good spells of possessions and there were a few instances of a series of lovely short passes leading to a chance.




Sterling looked bright as ever when he made his cameo, showing great work ethic and the technique and flair to match it. If we can hold onto him he could definitely be one of our future stars.





Cons: Where do I begin? Firstly our inability to score goals is something that worries me to no end. We're after loaning out our only genuine no.9  and there were a good few crosses sent into the box that seemed directed to nobody in particular. Very anxious to see who Rodgers brings in to replace him.




Despite maintaining the majority of possession (as was expected) there were more instances of sloppy passing than I would have liked to see although I presume that's all about getting used to the new system.




Pepe Reina's blunder: that's two howlers in two games for him now and while I love the man a ridiculous amount there will be a time (in the future if this continues) that something will have to be done. Obviously this is an overreaction because it's probably just bad form although I hate seeing a man who has been so reliable between the sticks for years make so many mistakes and last season wasn't his best either.




Also the atmosphere was pretty poor for most of the game too and that's something that we pride ourselves in as a club.




I am totally aware that we are in a process of rebuilding and all that but when we can't manage to get a comfortable victory over a team like Hearts then improvements need to be made.

It really doesn't end up being more offensive minded, it just ends up being less about putting a winger into a defensive position and expecting them to play those different spots. I know that 4 at the back has been the dominant style in the Premier League for years now, but 3-5-2 and 3-6-1 have worked well for teams in other leagues (I am thinking of Italy specifically). 

Man City are the only team that really ever try it, and that is because they have De Mancini. But they've used Kompany in more of a sweeper role and put more bodies in the midfield... and it has worked for them.

~~Finally, since the friendlies, someone apart from Downing has scored this season from open play for Liverpool.~~ Disregard that, my brain is full of waffle.

Gerrard doesn't seem to have the pace to burst through defences anymore, he still tries and seems to give it away, and his balls were off today. I hope he gets a bit better than the last few games.

Suarez was a bit off, and we looked poor because of it, we need another striker very badly.

Morgan Looked competent for someone of his age.

The commentators were terrible, confused as to why Liverpool were backpassing, couldn't remember who did the early Liverpool foul that deserved a yellow, and kept badgering on about how Carroll needed to be on the field.

Reina.. He has looked awful this season, I'm not sure what has happened.

Shelvey has such a damned good boot, but I'm not sure if I like him trying to be Gerrard v2, but I spose it's good to try it on from those distances.

The biggest thing for me: Liverpool plays differently against ""weaker"" opposition than big game opposition, this needs to be fixed, it's clearly a mental thing. We can't compete for top 4 without cruising through these games.

Finally, I do however think Rodgers needs to be given another month till we can really see how Liverpool will go playing this sytem, because currently they still clearly don't quite ""click"" into the system, and once that happens, we will see more fluid play.

There was another chance that Suarez tried to go himself instead of passing it to a player in space which would have been a certain goal but it escapes me.... He became greedy in possession and he left his first touch at home until around the 80th minute. Something I don't like about Luis is that when things don't go his way he gets very stroppy, you may not like that fact, but it's true. As a Liverpool fan, I can see it, fans of other teams can see it, take off your blinkers. Not a great display by a player who is **A LOT** better than what we saw tonight. Obviously I still have to give him huge respect for being the hero of the night, great finish for the winner and when I saw the BE STRONG LUCAS message I got the warm fuzzies and went all ""OH YOU! &lt;3""

Downing was good at left back, made some good forward runs and held off Templeton well for the most part. His crossing was still terrible though and I'm not going to get carried away and say ""Oh this is the resurrection of Downing! He's found his niche!"" lets see how he fairs against a Premier League side first, yeah?

Henderson looked right up for it. I'm glad to see that. I thought he would come good last season but it seems like he's just taking a bit longer. Showing real signs of development and when he said ""I feel like i've become a man at Liverpool."" I believe him. He looked a lot more grown up tonight. Think we'll be seeing a lot more of him in Europa League and domestic cups. A midfield 3 of the Dark Lord, Allen and Henderson is tidy!

Adam Morgan is great. I love his passion, he's so happy to be playing for Liverpool. He was definitely a bit too excited tonight but he was getting in the right areas, it was just lack of experience and composure on the ball I felt that let him down. He was like an excited pup biting everyone's ankles.

Overall, it wasn't a terrible display. We wasted chances, we need to work on our finishing but it was all Liverpool in possession for most of the second half.

Oh yea... and Reina's clanger? LOL He nearly dropped European football for us like he dropped Templeton's shot. He owes Suarez a massive thank you.

true,securitypodcast,null,null,"Yeah, I guess now that I'm actually looking at a episode list, I'll have to give you that a lot of the stories tend to fall flat.  

Beast Below was a great concept, but the ending of ""Oh, the whale wants to help"" kind of deflated a lot of the tension the story had built up.  But on the plus side, the scene where you see the Doctor's internal struggle with killing the whale is fantastic.

Victory of the Daleks i would say probably is one of the most underwhelming Dalek story.  

The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone could have easily been edited down to one episode.  Plus, it changed the rules Blink had established which it always feels weird when a series violates its own rules.  

Vampires of Venice is completely forgettable.  

Amy's Choice was another great concept that was deflated by a bad ending.  Seeing Amy realize that she doesn't want to live in a world that doesn't have Rory is what finally makes their relationship believable.

The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood also could have been edited to one episode.  Also, more of the focus should have been put on the twist where in this episode, it's the humans that are the bloodthirsty attackers who the Doctor has to stop.

Vincent and the Doctor had an amazing ending scene which tends to make people such as myself forget that the bulk of the episode was rather forgettable.  

The Lodger introduced a great character, but the story itself was a bit underwhelming.  

The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang got a bit overcomplicated.


I guess overall, now that I look at the actual stories and break it down like this, the plots themselves are rather underwhelming and forgettable, but there's quite a bit of great moments and the focus turned more towards character rather than plot, which hurt in some instances, but also lead to a lot of great scenes that focused more on the characters' internal struggles.

I had my first broadband connection with ntl and stayed after the switch. At some point, we made the mistake of switching the account we paid our direct debit with and our biggest problems (barring the shitty install job) started there.

They began cutting off our service for non-payment, and every phone call seemed to bring a different answer. At one point, I had to pay on my own debit card as a 15 year old to get the internet back up so I could do my homework.

Eventually, we grew tired of the BS and pushed our way up a few levels on the phone. It turned out they'd been trying migrate databases, and somehow this led to an error which caused us to be billed from two separate bank accounts (my dad should have noticed) and still be cut off for non-payment.

They owed us something to the tune of £400. Which was credited.
No goodwill. I hope I never use their service again.

But, Donna is my favorite.  I hated her first episode.  By the end of her tenure, I was heartbroken to see her go.  

Watching Tennant and Tate together was exciting - they seemed like best friends.  They had such chemistry, and none of it romantic, which was refreshing (not that Rose &amp; Martha's romantic angles weren't appreciated, but it was good to finally have someone where that wasn't even an option).  And as an added bonus, they were funnier together than any of the other combinations in New Who so far!  

I loved the storylines Donna got.  Bad Wolf is good and all, but Donna's dream life and the beetle on her back were awesome.  Also, without Donna, there'd be no Wilf.  And Wilf is great!

This is patently untrue. Even if you were to ignore the relationships he had with Sarah Jane and more noticeably Romana there's still the blatantly romantic relationship he had with Charley Pollard. I mean he explicitly states that he loves her, for crying out loud!

How others react to characters does not make them good characters. If everyone fell in love with Wesley would that make his character ""something special""? No, it would just make him poorly written and executed.

&gt; Donna is bitchy &amp; mean.

So we're calling fictional characters names now? You really aren't helping your case.

&gt; While she becomes a better person by being with the doctor she's still shallow, rude and obnoxious most of the time.

She's no more shallow then Rose or Martha was. Just like them she starts from the mundanity of normal life to a willingness to sacrifice her life for the good of humanity.

Some of the midfield play and ball retention was very good, but we also looked clueless in the final 3rd yet again, were wasteful, didn't create many good chances and at times invited pressure at the back. Also wasted too many set-pieces. Suarez was having an off day, so that definitely took something out of our attack but we still don't have enough people who can make the difference when we're not creating. Nice to have Sterling and I'm optimistic about Assaidi, and Borini will get better because he's got a lot of talent that just hasn't quite clicked yet - but we could really, really use a good goalscorer in the next 24 hours.

Dorium mentions that Lake Silencio was chosen [spoiler](#s ""as the location of the Doctor's Death"") because it's a still point in time, so it can become a fixed point more easily. An assassin capable of sensing still/fixed points could choose to kill someone at that point, and it would be impossible for them to be resurrected.

And while there isn't any inherent knowledge that comes with being a Time Lord, it seems like there's a greater capacity for learning  and knowledge (hence why Donna melts down with the Doctor's consciousness in her head - a Time Lord brain can ""store"" more than a humans)

Plus Time Lords have other biological tricks - like when the Doctor manages to reverse his own poisoning.

I think that Billie's acting capabilities were beyond her years (many forget she began at just 19) and that her chemistry with Eccleston was superb. I also think that Catherine acted the great range of Donna superbly and had excellent banter against Tennant.

They're both expertly performed characters, the real question is how they're used. Donna was used in an interesting and atypical way. She wasn't used as a typical ""damsel in distress"" or a ""one true love"" and provided the foil to the too often brooding Ten.

I personally feel that Donna was allowed more room to grow as a character than Rose, who was hampered by a particularly disappointing second season. I think that Second Series ""falling in love"" Rose was a far less interesting and realistic character than First Series Rose, and that dampens her character in many ways for me.",0,1346373563,null,0,false,0,c617r50,t3_z3id7,t1_c617r50,t1_c617kbe,null,1429778322,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Jay should be able to make a big contribution at Bolton and in their bid for promotion.  Bolton need a player like him, especially since Muamba is gone now.  And he just wasn't going to get the playing time at Liverpool, and we made a number of signings that push him down the pecking order.

I do feel a bit bad for him - you could never question his commitment to the club.  And he was *so close* to being a really valuable squad member - just lacking that extra little bit of height (so he missed a lot of defensive headers), that little bit of pace, and that little bet of technical skill.  

That said, he's definitely PL quality - I've seen loads of midfielders worse than him.  But he's just not quite good enough for a club with our ambitions. 

Hope he has a great year at Bolton.  And who knows?  Maybe he WILL end up blossoming at Bolton and he'll have a long career here after he comes back.

I believe it was put in place to keep the Time-Lord race from becoming literal gods. Arguably the Doctor could still have to adhere to this based solely on a safety protocol in the TARDIS perhaps. I think the idea of River Song giving him her regenerations means that essentially she restarted his hearts and gave him all of her remaining energy. Being that she only had a time head, as it were, and she doesn't live in a TARDIS near a time vortex she doesn't get her regeneration energy back. 

Some of that is speculative of course, I just know that there have been Time-Lords that have been granted more regenerations by the Council.

true,tinyphotographer,tennant,Tennant,"I see Rose's reaction to Sarah Jane in a completely different light. 

Rose was young and naive at the time. She was completely unaware of the fact that the Doctor had had other companions until she met Sarah Jane. It probably never crossed her mind. Maybe it was silly of her to feel like she was so special but the Doctor had never made mention of anyone from his past, which is standard Doctor.

Now that Rose does know that there have been others before her, she's grappling with the idea that one day her adventure will end. She had probably never thought about that, seeing how she wasn't planning on leaving. And on top of that, she realizes that the Doctor will continue on and find someone new. So at this point, I'm assuming that she feels like a *very* small part of the Doctor's life. The Doctor has, up until this point, made her feel incredibly important as is standard Doctor. Her entire understanding of their relationship and her place in his world has just been shattered. 

Also, this episode was fairly soon after the Doctor's regeneration. She just experienced a great loss, even if there technically wasn't one. She saw this man that she loves (platonic or romantic, take your pick) ""kill"" himself for her and turn into someone else, she had to feel a huge sense of loss. So when she gets her Doctor back, undoubtedly she is going to cling tighter to him. And cling even tighter after she realizes that she can't stay with him forever, like she planned. So I feel I can't blame Rose for being jealous of Sarah Jane.

After another few episodes I realized I loved Tennant as The Doctor.  Then when it came time for his regeneration, I was again worried that the change in actor would ruin it for me.  And again I was wrong about Matt Smith.  He's an excellent doctor.

Assuming they don't try something radically different (no sexism intended, but for example, there's been rumor that the next Doctor could be female), I have no doubts that whoever they choose to play the character will be done wisely and cautiously, and the actor will fill the role perfectly.  Unlike some TV series where a character is replaced with a new actor and it ruins the show, I am completely sold on the story they have created that the Doctor is genuinely the same person throughout his regenerations.  Yes, his personality adopts a few new quirks with each regeneration, but the actors have done a great job, at least for me, at keeping the Doctor's soul alive.",0,1346382297,null,0,false,0,c619v7x,t3_z3fjh,t1_c619v7x,t3_z3fjh,null,1429779318,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

He was on the verge of signing for Arsenal and AC Milan before he went on a free to Ajaccio. America wouldn't budge on the transfer fee for Arsenal, the greedy bastards. And AC Milan waited on him to prove himself in South Africa. Except Aguirre preferred an older keeper over him for ""experience"" and effectively screwed him over. He's proving himself at Ajaccio by keeping them up last year. Their defense is like a colander trying to hold water.

Evolution isn't linear. We know this through recent experiments done using organisms from our early genetic lineage.

But, Gallifreyans look enough like humans to be similar. They must have a similar genetic makeup to us, perhaps slightly more advanced (considering they were around longer). Now we also know that Time Lords came about through continued exposure to the time vortex. We already know that a big contributor to genetic mutation on our planet is cosmic radiation.

The Doctor always talks about the potential of humans, perhaps his fascination, and the reason he brings companions is because he had always believed that humans could reach the same level of evolution of Time Lords using the same process.

A legitimate criticism: Your perspective is off. Pick a point off center of the page, and have all of your diagonal tardis lines point to that point instead of being parallel. You'll end up with something that looks a little more realistic, because that is how we see the world. Also, your tardis is 3d while your Dalek is 2d. A little shading and the addition of some perspective lines would help with that. Otherwise you have some very clean straight lines and the silhouette of your dalek looks very well thought out. Using a couple of these little tricks will improve upon your art a great deal, with very little effort.

Also, since it is a line drawing, you may want to make the lines thicker where the object is close to you (the viewer) and thinner as they travel away from you. This is an easy way to give the illusion of depth, and will get rid of that pesky 2d feel.

If you youtube or google drawing with perspective points, line drawing, and chiaroscuro shading (sounds harder than it is), you'll get a better idea of what I mean.

I do think generaly it appears there has been an absence of a coherent strategy. Fabio and Nelson were due to be our only defensive signings, which was a joke as all of English football knew we had defensive weaknesses.

No matter what QPR owners and manager say, the buys of the past week or more were not planned and were either opportunistic or came about due to poor preparation for this season and without relevant game plans for each of the 2 first matches.

Before the last signing we had a net spend of £1.5m, reported wages have apparently been grossly exaggerated by the press and Fernandes says they are lower than last season - though I find that difficult to believe.

Green will be sent out on loan to a Championship club or overseas. I saw him against Swansea, he's a broken man.

The only signing I don't like is Johnson, I don't see the point of a striker that demonstrably doesn't score more than 3 a season.

I guess 3 years isn't unreasonable.""), and there's a small gap in terms of driving standards between ""not prosecuted"" and ""convicted for dangerous driving"", making it feel capricious when you sentence those who are convicted to long sentences.

As a driver, I'd argue that the fix is not heavier sentences on the few who get convicted; it's more prosecutions, firstly to frighten people who are basically law abiding but are letting their driving standards slip into straightening up, and secondly so that when we sentence people, we have a nice pile of recent case law to compare sentences to, so that we can see whether the sentence is fair.

Side note - strict liability offences are ones like speeding or using a handheld mobile phone, where the mere fact that you were seen doing something is proof of your guilt, as against offences like dangerous driving, where the prosecution also has to show that what you were doing was dangerous in the opinion of the ""average reasonable man"".",0,1346399942,null,0,false,0,c61d7um,t3_z2nvs,t1_c61d7um,t1_c60wy8u,null,1429780897,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Coastal communities in the Highlands and Islands are becoming increasingly frustrated by the intransigence of the London-based Crown Estates Commission, and are calling for the assets and income managed by the Commissioners to be devolved to Scotland and to the communities themselves.
&gt;
&gt;There is growing anger at what many view as a snub by the body, who administer large swathes of Scotland's coastline and offshore assets, after it refused to hand over control of resources to local communities despite recommendations to do so.
&gt;
&gt;In March a damning report by Westminster MPs said that the Crown Estate Commission operates with a ""lack of accountability and transparency"" in Scotland and accused the organisation of acting like an absentee landlord.
&gt;
&gt;The report said: ""At best, [the Crown Estate] has little regard for those needs and interests other than where it serves Crown Estate Commission's business interests.

How can I introduce you to QPR in one Reddit comment post? I guess I can't. I'll have a little attempt here and see what happens.

During the 80's and early 90's QPR was often the top London football club. In fact, in the early 70's our stadium was considered an example of how modern stadiums should be built - difficult to believe that now. In the 80's we were the only professional club to have a plastic pitch, which we used to great affect.

Much of QPR history has been about emerging quickly from the lower leagues, doing well at the top level, being mis-managed, then falling back to the lower leagues to return again some day.

Our greatest players have included, Stan Bowles, Rodney Marsh, Les Ferdinand, Mark Lazarus, David Seaman, Gerry Francis [others here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C._players).
We won the League cup in 1967 and have been in several cup finals, including the FA cup final in 1982 (when I started supporting QPR) and the Milk cup in 1988.

The QPR stadium (Loftus rd) is set in amongst residential housing and there are plans to replace it in about 4-5 years with a 45,000 seater stadium, which is a big jump considering our current stadium only holds 18,200 people.

Squatters rights have never been about giving the homeless shelter. They are a terrible idea for that as well. 

Squatters right is a legal concept from ye olden days. Back when there was no register of property and a person's claim to land depended on a deed and circumstantial evidence.

A huge issue at the time, going upto the 1990s, was that if ownership of land was difficult to prove, people would not use land as they couldn't be sure they had right to it. You wouldn't build on a plot of land that you weren't 100% sure about because the actual owner could pop up, sue, and have your building torn down.

As land is one of the most finite forms of property, this is unacceptable.

So if someone possessed land for several years without incident, the property would become his through squatters laws.

This was almost overwhelmingly used for minor plots of land. A fence put up a foot further than it should have, for example. The 'actual' owners, if they existed, were protected so long as they were vigilant enough to keep tabs on the property and action against any incursions.


Then in the 2000s, the land registry, a government agency since the late 19th century that helped solidify property claims by putting them on a formal register, started a process called **compulsory registration**.

Today, any property, registered or not, must be re-registered or registered for the first time when it is conveyed. That means that over time all land in the UK will be registered, meaning everyone knows from an authoritative source who it belongs to.

Which makes squatting, a remedy to mismatches between ownership claims, utterly redundant. ",0,1346401620,null,0,false,0,c61dexk,t3_z4i9g,t1_c61dexk,t3_z4i9g,null,1429781055,52,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,52

true,LeoKhenir,lfc92,,"Here's my point of view on the Charlie Adam transfer (both us buying and now apparently selling/loaning him out):

I, as many others, were excited to see him play with Stevie and Lucas last season. He was easily one of Blackpool's best players the season before, and his freekicks and shots looked like we had an uglier version of Stevie G on the way. As it turns out, this was not the case. While he certainly showed some of the qualities that made King Kenny want him so, he for the most part fell through. Horrible late tackles, weak defensively, and the passing/shooting accuracy seemed reduced from what we saw him do at Blackpool. This might be due to him being an outstanding individual in a poor club before, and now being a mediocre at best individual in a better club.

For me, it became apparent that Charlie Adam and Liverpool was not a good couple. With this season's squad additions (Allen and Sahin) we are loaded with central midfielders. BR decides to stick with the two world class players (Stevie and Lucas), his new signings (obviously) and the two talents (Henderson and Shelvey). Perhaps we might even see Suso play this season. This means the mediocre, almost 30 years old midfielder is surplus to requirements. Rather than rotting him in the reserves, we sell him. I too certainly hope he will succeed - I like the lad, just not as a Liverpool player.

The ""unfortunately, Stoke is the perfect club for him"" is a bit tongue in cheek, that did not convey well over the internet - not without a longer explanation, at least. I predict he will do very well under Pulis - Stoke is a very physical team that also play a very direct style of play. What I'm fearing is his horror tackles on Suarez/Borini/Gerrard/Allen/Sahin (who's notoriously injury prone) rendering them out for the season. It's almost blind luck that Adam hasn't ended another player's career yet. This is the part of him I don't like. I don't think he does it by intent, but he just has bad tackle timing.

&gt; During the Third Doctor's tenure, producer Barry Letts was adamant that the device not become a cure-all for the series, and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it.

&gt; By season 18, both script editor Christopher H Bidmead and producer John Nathan-Turner were eager to downplay the device as much as possible.

&gt; On the basis that a device that could help in any situation was very limiting for the script, Nathan-Turner decided that it would not return.

&gt; In contrast with Nathan-Turner's attitude that the sonic screwdriver should not be used as a cure-all, the new production team gave it even more functionality than previous versions which has given the series some criticism as it seems to be a deus ex machina, a literary device that is generally avoided.

For example, couldn't the law protect homeowners, but also recognise that in some cases, squatting is justified.  Squatters  could then be divided into 'beneficial squatters' and 'detrimental squatters', depending on how they've treated the place.

This would have the effect of, when a homeowner discovers one of their properties is being squatted in, but the squatters have maintained or improved the home, then a defined process would then kick in whereby the squatters are given time and some government assistance in moving on.

Detrimental squatters would then lose any shred of credibility in their argument that they have a right to occupy anothers house, because they have trashed it, and as such would have no right on a claim and could be evicted and prosecuted.

I feel the overarching effect of such thinking would be to offer some protection to people like the teacher that was talking on the radio this morning who couldn't afford anything in her area as she wasn't a contracted teacher, whilst coming down hard on the nasty ones we sometimes see in justiceporn.

No, I've expounded quite clearly the moral reason for rights - if one builds something, or works to pay for the building of something, or ones parents did and wished their children to have that property, then it is quite moral that that person would have rights over the property.

Also most land ownership is founded on conquest and seizure and is the real root of the 'dependency culture' (alongside private ownership of the means of production) indeed one common Victorian slogan was 'Give us back the Common Land and keep your Poor Relief' following the acts of Inclosure.

Likewise the foundation of feudalism can be seen as when the Lords seized control and monopoly over the mills essentially privatising the means of production.

This creates many people unable to earn their own livelihood with no recourse left but to sell their own labour at the whim of employers with the constant threat of unemployment.

Yes it has, there's been a need in society for property rights to be properly enforced, and this law has taken care of that need.

In GY, where I live, a 3 bedroom terraced house costs £125k, with a £15k deposit you can pay only £600 a month back over 25 years which is very affordable for most couples. The deposit is the main concern, this is why you can rent, but the rental value of a place like this is probably around £800, still very affordable for a working couple.",0,1346406483,null,0,false,0,c61dwyc,t3_z4i9g,t1_c61dwyc,t1_c61dshi,null,1429781291,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Also social cost - many people won't be rehoused (waiting lists are long - there's a housing shortage remember), some people will die on the streets.

So I have to ask - was there a huge problem with squatters? Horror stories of little old ladies getting thrown out of their homes? We're currently enduring historic rent rises, a lack of housing and a continuing recession - this leads to a lot of people in precarious housing situations and desperate. The fact some of them can squat (until a civil claim is completed) is *that* the biggest problem?

Yes there should - but that's hugely different from just taking someone else's because you've justified it to yourself.

Already protected as the occupier under existing rules, even if they're not there for a while.

&gt;It isn't so rare - remember the spate of people coming back to find romanians living in their houses? The point is that people shouldn't have to justify why they should be 'allowed' to use their own property as they see fit

These people, under the existing rules, could use force to remove the squatters and the squatters committed an offence by remaining, and so the police could remove them, by force. Any suggestion that it would take 3 months to shift them is wrong, and any lawyer or officer who suggested to the occupier that this is the case ought, in my view, find themselves facing misconduct charges.

Indeed, if you've got the builders in between tenants, this still counts as occupation.

true,sdtp,cnty-england,Southern Fairy,"The point isn't about property, it's about criminalising people who should be *helped*, not put in jail. It's a classic case of the 'scales of justice' being tipped in the privileged's favour.

Don't get me wrong, I agree that squatter's rights should be gotten rid of. If the Police rock up to someone's house and a bunch of homeless people are living there, they should be removed. And then taken somewhere safe where they are sheltered from rain and cold. There are 4 basic necessities that every human being needs - water, food, ~~shelter~~ warmth and protection from the elements, and it's a fucking TRAVESTY that in England we are not able to help everybody who doesn't have these 4 basic necessities.

Now some may bring the argument that some of these people are 'good-for-nothing drug addicts/alcoholics' or whatever, and so do you really think criminalising these people is going to help them on the path to becoming a contributing member of society? Fuck no.

As people have said before me, there are citizens of this country, and even people who aren't citizens, who are sitting on hundreds of empty houses. And sure, we're a democracy, that's their right. If they have the money to own 20 houses, fine. But I feel that to evolve as a species we need to look at the needs of many rather than the needs (greeds) of the few. We should be aiding, not criminalising, people who have hit rock-bottom. As Russell Brand said on Newsnight (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsMU77TwYM0), ""Drug addiction is a disease that needs to be treated, criminalisation is not a deterrent,""
Likewise with homelessness. It should be treated appropriately, with empathy and compassion, not with the 'firm hand of the law'.

With regards to squatters who do it for fun? Fuck those people, stick them in jail. (I once knew a girl who once spent her summer with her friends squatting in a house getting fucked up. Fuck her.)

S6 creates the offence of 'securing entry by violence', but S6(1a) exempts the occupier, or intending occupier, from this offence.

S7:

&gt;Adverse occupation of residential premises.

&gt;(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section and to section 12A(9) below, any person who is on any premises as a trespasser after having entered as such is guilty of an offence if he fails to leave those premises on being required to do so by or on behalf of—

&gt;(a)a displaced residential occupier of the premises; or
(b)an individual who is a protected intending occupier of the premises.


If you are the occupier (*not* the landlord), or are an intending occupier, it is a criminal offence for trespassers to remain once you tell them to leave. 
Further, you have a common law right to remove trespassers from your property using reasonable force. Don't forget that S6 allows you to use force to reenter your property to exercise both your common law and S3 'any person' powers regarding use of force.

The real cause of 'dependency culture' isn't single mothers, or moral deterioration but the private ownership of land, resources and the means of production. 

It has created inevitable dependency from the feudal peasantry denied access to the mills, to the factory workers forced to sell their own labour after the common land was seized by the Inclosure Acts. Left with no other means to secure a livelihood they are always under the threat of unemployment and this continues today not just with blue collar workers threatened with mine and factory closures, but even white collar workers left ruined by outsourcing and recession.

true,Anzereke,null,null,"&gt;You expand too far. I've done no such thing. All I've claimed is the right to own property and hold exclusive rights over that.

Funny because you just said;

&gt;I put morality and my rights above the claims of others that they have need because I owe them nothing. 

That would seem to be a pretty clear cut contraction yet again...you really don't understand the idea of sticking to the same arguments do you?

&gt;No, I've expounded quite clearly the moral reason for rights - if one builds something, or works to pay for the building of something, or ones parents did and wished their children to have that property, then it is quite moral that that person would have rights over the property.

Not in this post you didn't. Actually you don't in this post either. You just say it's moral and make no attempt to define why...aren't you claiming to have read philsophy? The way that works is you have to actually explain why it's moral not just say that it is. 

Especially considering your position is contradictory due to the mention of inheritance. The child did nothing to earn it, what right do they have to something they didn't earn?

&gt;I know you have a computer, so I know you don't yourself live in poverty of the global sort, so that aspect of the argument is over before it started.

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That's hilarious, you ever actually met someone in poverty? Or heard of internet cafes? Libraries? Wifi spots?
Or do you think that the poor are this amorphous mass that feels no need to hit up the internet and enjoy their life?
Personally I'm shit poor, this computer is almost a decade old and if it breaks I will not be able to obtain another. But hey, your magic internet vision means you already knew all that right?

Again, ad hominem claims are not arguments. Saying that the other guy has a computer and so has not yet given his shirt to someone else is both hyperbole and ignores the distinction between personal and private property without argues against it...which again makes your claims of studying philosophy a tad suspect.

&gt;I have, as I said elsewhere I'm broadly deontological with influences from Kant, while accepting the necessary evil of very limited utilitarianism.

Kant, Mill, Nietzche, Locke. Oh look, I can quote philsophers' names too. Care to actually provide an argument, or are you going to keep on giving vague references to one and not actually providing it?

Especially since broadly deontological is such a wide position as to mean almost anything. All you're saying is that you generally base your thinking on innate values rather then long term consequences. With no further information you could hold any moral position from facism to christian paternalism to anarchism. Deontology versus Utilitarianism is what you learn in standard grade RMP. It is not a moral basis, it's a category.

&gt;You're going to need to improve your quality of argument and stop assuming **justified** expansion on the things I say to what you claim I say if you wish us to progress, because currently you're taking what I say, making assumptions based on that, and then attacking those straw men. It is not productive.

Most of that paragraph is completely unnecessary. You basically just said strawman fallacy. And show no sign of explaining why I committed this fallacy since I quoted your position, you make claims of saying things you didn't in that post and have failed to give more then vague claims of arguments.

The interesting part is your phrasing here as the word justified (aI bolded it) would in this case mean this is no longer a strawman fallacy. Assuming a justified expansion would mak it into a logical counterpoint, not a strawman. Which undermines you even further but I'll be nice and assume you just mistyped. Perhaps don't try so hard to be overly verbose next time and you won't stumble so hilariously.

Yes, indeed - and there are several ways to address this without finding the nearest empty property and then coming up with some cod-justification about the owners' circumstances to legitimise your actions.

&gt;It's not fascist

Actually, it is.

&gt; depriving people of a reasonable life is a fascist attribute 

Someone else owning more than you does not give you an automatic right to what they have. It's really that simple.

&gt;far more then allowing people to horde property irresponsibly. 

Overlaying your own assumptions about why someone owns X, Y or Z does not automatically make it fact.

&gt;Look at the number of root sources our mass media uses for their journalism.

And now we move onto assumptive generalisations. Lots of 'our mass media' have their own reporters, their own journalists, and so on - sure, they also buy news off of each other, but you're now using the journalists/ 'mass media' themselves to ignore the actual people in these stories, by suggesting that all these stories are somehow engineered by Gov. or business.

Of course there were some students who's parents had really scraped together what they could, but a lot of the students were spoiled rotten. One day I was doing a class on things people like, things they appreciate and things they regret (or something along those lines, this was 4 years ago). One girl got up and said she liked her birthday, she appreciated her parents gave her money but regretted they didn't give her more.

When winter came (it's between -5 and -10 in Beijing) I needed a nice warm coat. I went to the army surplus store and picked up an army coat; [it was like wearing a duvet](http://janetong.com/image_gallery/data/P1420544_renamed_26308.jpg).

You're right, it's not as black and white as some make out, but you have to look at it from both sides. The landlords often aren't rich, they need the rent to cover mortgages or risk losing the houses and all the money they've put into them.

To make a claim against someone you have to go to small claims court which costs £800, if you try and evict someone they often just refuse and make it incredibly difficult.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"This isn't strictly true.  The best figures I can find on the ONS website seem to suggest that verses 1970 the average household income when inflation adjusted is hasn't quite doubled, but this period should certainly see a lot more women starting work full time.  In the same period the average house price has more than doubled.

However, things to note.  Childcare costs have increased vastly, since you suddenly don't have a stay at home mother to look after the kids (not an insignificant expense).  In real terms utility bills have increased vastly over the last 40 years, cost of transport  is hugely up (and lots of these families will have 2 cars).  Insurance costs are up a lot over the last 40 years, too.  I'm not sure about the tax burden, but I believe it's increased for the average household overall (things like VAT, NI, council tax more than offsetting long term decrease in income tax).  The long and the short of it is that, even with 2 earners, people don't have twice as much money to spend on a house verses 40 years ago.

Mortgage rates have actually declined since the 70s, but they smaller interest rate won't make up for the fact that you're taking out a mortgage for much more money, so end up spending more paying off debt too.

But why does everyone need a lawnmower? They obviously don't.

Indeed with exception of personal property which is individually required. Toothbrush, computer (if you want to work/learn/exist in the modern day), bed and so on. We can point this out about a lot of things. With automated cars there's no need for everyone to own a car when you can just have a public network of them. etc etc

If we all want to be greedy children then we're all fucked. Reality does not car what capitalism says, it doesn't have infinite resources for ifinite growth and greed. But there's no need for that in order to have a comfortable life. All I need is to be able to pick up whatever tool (lawnmower in this case) I require from some central location somewhat easily.

**We need the utility of an object not the object itself.** *I don't need a lawnmower I just need to cut my grass.* So if I can pick up a lawnmower, use it and then put it back, that works much better then having to keep one around all the time. Which also breaks the 'everyone needs one' issue.

That could explain why so many Chinese (and other SE Asian) students attend British universities, yet make no attempt to integrate into the social life of the other students. Of course there are exceptions, but they have a tendency to be cliquey and don't hang out with the home students all that much.

It reminds me of one of the Victorian protest slogans: ""Give us back the common lands and you can keep your poor relief""

It's also just inefficient as Attlee found: 
&gt;""From 1906 to 1909, Attlee worked as manager of Haileybury House, a charitable club for working class boys in Stepney in the East End of London run by his old school. 

&gt;Prior to this, his political views had been conservative. However, he was shocked by the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with slum children. He came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty, and only massive action and income redistribution by the state would have any serious effect.""

It just leads to a patchy and unfair network of services so that someone in the North might have no provision whilst someone in the South has plenty, and also it is making fundamental human needs subject to the whim of the rich - who would often rather support an opera house or Eton College than a soup kitchen.

As for why we 'need' it in the first place:  [this comment](http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17740519) puts it better than I ever could.

To me the defining thing about charity is that it isn't aid between equals, there is someone who demeans themselves to receive it and someone who takes the glory of giving, it has a twisted moral sense to it so it carries guilt.

Money has been shown to inhibit creative thinking, which frankly is the only thing there is any good reason to do with a human being.

He carried out extensive repairs to the properties he used, and always paid for the bills in the same way he would as a legal owner. Once, a TV station paid him to use his squat as a set for a programme that was set in a squat. They then proceeded to rearrange it and make it look like a mess, because really it just looked like a normal home. 

Some squatters will be like your friend, some will be like mine. At the same time, some legal homeowners will live in hazardous and dirty conditions, whilst some will be responsible occupants. There is no eternal law that says someone who lives in a building but doesn't own it will treat it badly. In some cases, the presence of squatters will be better than the building being simply neglected.

There is one major problem I have with the new law. Residents were already protected under previous laws. Those ignorant to squatting sometimes see it as a matter of them going on holiday and coming home to a house full of junkies, who the law then goes out of their way to protect. In reality, the (old) law meant that any residential property which was lived in, or was intended to be lived in in the near future would have any squatters removed quicksmart, for obvious reasons.

A squatter's claim to their 'rights' (actually not rights but simply a space in the law; the point where the rights of occupant vs. owner are blurred and must be settled in a civil court case) only applied when the building was genuinely empty. One could not simply start living in a house which was occupied by it's owner. Now, occupying a house that has been empty for years and will remain so into the future, even if taking care of it in the process, will be a criminal offence.

They remake them because there's no money in showing someone else's TV show, you have to buy the right to show from the creator, but once you've shown it and sold the advertising space there's no more money for you as you don't own the show.

If they instead buy the rights to make an original show, they can take a formula they know has already proven to be successful, and in some cases use scripts are already written. they make it themselves in their own studios for what i imagine in TV world is not really that much, and then the whole thing is theirs to sell.
If it's popular they can sell that show all over the world, even back to the country the original came from. That includes merchandising DVD rights and anything else that comes along, as the show they remade is their property. 
The investment is slightly higher but the income for a successful show is enormous.

Your claim is that you can waste resources how you like and there is nothing wrong with this. Further you have no responsibility to another suffering person.

Objectively there is no difference between you and that person, self interest is primitive and non-applicable. You would take some enjoyment in wasting resources perhaps, in the long run I would argue that such pleasures and transitory and unsatisfying, but more importantly we are not talking about something you need. We are talking about something you want.

Conversely without the thing they need (in this case a house) that person will continue to suffer. There are houses available, you are simply stating that you a) Have a right to withhold and b) Have no obligation.

a)-the right to property is nonsensical, ultimately amounting to an agreement with an authority that you will give them x and in exchange they will defend with violence your claimed property. Should they wish it the authority retains full control it should be noted, property can be ceased without some magical claim stopping that happening. Thus what your claimed right amounts to is that you have violence on your side should the person wish to use your property, personal possession or use does not apply. It's nothing more then a claim by violence.

b)-as stated previously there is no difference between the two of you. No inate difference that made this state of affairs happen, we are products of our enviroment (I hold that free will exists, but to claim that we are anything other then a product of our biopsychosocial factors is to ignore well established science) and thus you have no more inate right to be happy then the other person. That is to say you both possess that right (glass half full thinking) or neither does. In either case, as someone who has you have no right to deny something to someone who doesn't have, especially not given a lack of real suffering to you at the loss.

&gt;At least from my position - to go back to the main point - you can let people live in your house if so choose, or deny it, instead of having no choice in the matter.

What gives you the right to tell someont ehy cannot live in that house? You aren't using it. You just lay a claim to it. They conversely need it but have no claim.

Yes, guess what. Paying a bunch of people fuck all is cheaper then maintaining machines when your goal is not to create a good product but to create an adequate product that will last the minimum time before forcing repurchase. That being the case, automation remains an inevitable crawl, we just slow it down a lot due to obselescence being a major factor in our production.

&gt;You don't work ""all the time"", you work about 40 hours a week (out of 168), and it is good for you to work to an extent, look at how many retired people only seem ""old"" when they retire.

40 hours a week do I? Nice psychic powers there. I assume your statement overrides reality then?
Also good for you to work to an extent? I suppose you hav some nice science to back up that insane claim then?

Old people seem old when they get old. Because they are old. Which sucks but negligible senesence is not an easy thing to achieve.

Now tell me please where I said that people shouldn't work? I just don't think that they should be forced to when we already have the technology not to need that any more. At the very least we should be automating dangerous shit (construction for instance, wherein a lot of money goes towards shooting down automation becuase we're a stupid species) and stuff we don't want to do. And don't get me started on the bizarre amounts of make-work in this society.

If you had all you needed without working. A society that actually provided for you, you have food shelter transport etc, access to items you want and so on, all of which is entirely possible with current tech. Are you honestly telling me that you'd never work again? I'm a lazy bastard and I still can't see myself being okay with doing nothing.

On my own, in the back, diagonally across from the driver. Two? Both in the back. Three? One up front, two in the back. Four? Three in the back, one in the front.

I'm sure there's a dirty joke you can make from that somewhere, but that's how it works. 

For hackney carriages (i.e. black cabs you can hail off the street), you typically can't get in the front, so everyone goes in the back.

As for tip, journey from the center of town to my house typically costs £8-9. So I just hand over a £10 and be done with it. If it's some other amount, hand over the next highest note, and when the change comes back, just pick out coins to leave a pound or so behind. I know a few taxi drivers, it's sucky job and they have to spend a lot of time with drunkards or idiots. Tipping is nice, but at the very least be courteous and friendly.

Private hire companies keep notes on you if you ring from a land line. After the first time you book, you typically don't even have to tell your address, they know. Also, tipping does seem to be noted, and you get a taxi quicker as taxis are keen to pick up tippers.

Also, if he had stipulated no dogs in the contract then he had plenty of time to evict them for breaching it, instead of leaving them in it for 2 years and allowing the property to deteriorate.

&gt;&gt;""And therein lies the problem. Here we have another Guardian article in which jobs are seen as an extension of the welfare system. Workers have a ""right"" to a job from the job tree. No questions asked about added value or productivity

&gt;&gt;The key to economic growth and increased employment is for people to realise that they have a responsibility to develop a skill that employers will need, or that they can market on a self-employed basis. Having secured employment, they have a responsibility to deliver value, generating wealth to justify their earnings.""

&gt;Your attitude is repulsive. The general public didn't decide to strip themselves of the ability to share this planet and it's natural capital. They didn't decide to limit themselves to the opportunities other people allow them to have, instead of using a share of our resources to create their own. They didn't decide to hand massive power and privilege to an unelected minority they then have to ""compete"" with.

&gt;This is a situation produced artificially by those who think other people exist to indulge their sense of entitlement. It has serious consequences for the people who find themselves disempowered and at the mercy of those with the control.

&gt;It's rather like an abusive husband keeping a tight grip on the household finances so he can control his wife - letting her have some cash when she ""deserves it"", and reminding her that she's worthless all the time to make her feel she can't complain. That's another thing this system's supporters like to do - demonise the jobless and accuse them of thinking too highly of themselves if they complain about their exploitation.

&gt;People have a right to a job because nobody should need the permission of anyone else to be active in our economy. Anyone who wants to work should have their share of our resources to do that with. They shouldn't have to go begging to people who think they deserve special rights to control our resources and opportunities.

&gt;But that's the point isn't it? If people had to co-operate with others instead of having power over other people's lives, they wouldn't be able to sit back and leech off vulnerable people's hard work.

This results in conflict, and arising from conflict comes laws and rights made in order to stop conflict occuring again.

Let's step back into reality for a moment though, accept that property rights are something that we have (and something that in my opinion would result in absolute chaos if we didn't), in which case, the right to tell someone that they cannot live in your house comes by virtue of *owning the damn house*. If you are going to let the state decide that someone can own your property as long as they *need* it more than you (in this case, something the squatter decides for themself, with a huge personal bias), then yes, get rid of property rights altogether as they are now redundant.

I'm not even going to go further into an argument over personal ownership of natural resources, as I don't have all day for a debate on two ideologies so incompatible a result will never be achieved.

Similarly, as other posters have suggested, we could instead try building *up* more instead of out.  Or, yes, people could consider moving outside of metropolitan centres to far, far cheaper housing (and lifestyle) if it were available (and where does this silly idea come from that there are no jobs anywhere in the UK apart from London?).

Plenty of people live quite comfortably outside of London.  If you want to live in London *and* so do lots of other people *and* town planners quite understandably want to reduce urban sprawl then obviously you're going to get butthurt about high-priced housing... but only because you're the kind of person that the town planners are *explicitly trying to discourage*.

The point is that nobody on this thread is talking about greenbelt apart from you, because it's completely irrelevant to the topic of conversation.  We're talking about a *general shortage* of housing across the country... and aside from the fact you apparently can't comprehend how people can possibly live or find work outside of central London, I assure you it's possible.  Milllions of us do it.

Greenbelt restrictions are not a problem for anyone apart from a small minority of blinkered people who think it's impossible to live anywhere outside of London.

The second being that it would take generations for this to occur, yet we as a country have an immediate problem with housing shortages and homeless people. 

Wouldn't it be better just to ignore the top 1% and their houses and instead close tax loopholes that are so widely used, and using this money to build more low income state sponsored housing. Then there would be no excuse for homeless people to be, well homeless if there is cheap housing for them.

It is seriously big business and he is a prized asset for inter. he has so many interests tied into him right now that they would probably need to hit £20M just for some of them to make a profit.

there is just no way that a deal of this type could be initiated and then finalized on deadline day. that is before taking into account the simple math that there are only 12 hours left and Brasil is further away than that by plane and i am pretty sure we don't have our medical team down there already and nor is he here",0,1346420988,null,0,false,0,c61fugu,t3_z4nte,t1_c61fugu,t1_c61fkzc,null,1429782201,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,"I work for a charity (not in fundraising directly) so I'm not likely to be impartial.

Charities do this because it works. It raises money for the cause that wouldn't otherwise be raised. You're not just paying for someone to go off on a ""jaunt"", the money donated supports the chosen cause and the event, if properly publicised, raises awareness of the charity. I don't actually understand why you've put ""for charity"" in inverted commas - what else are these things for if not for charity? The fact that it might be an enjoyable, challenging or rewarding event for those involved might leave you with a bad taste, but it's also the best way to incentivise raising money to someone who's perhaps not directly affected by the charity's cause. 

There are obviously costs to running events. It costs a fair amount of money to enter a high-profile yet high-return event like the London Marathon. Running the Three Peaks for example involves booking a night's accommodation near Ben Nevis, at least one local guide (you'll do at least one of the hills in the dark), a minibus with two non-climbing drivers (driver/work regs/etc...).

If the climbers don't make their targets, which cover the cost of their place plus a small profit, they fund the difference themselves. This ensures that the costs of the event are met and further incentivises the fundraiser to actually raise money. 

The people who would donate to a charity without this stuff will donate anyway, either on their own or when asked by a fundraiser. But getting people to sponsor their friend/colleague/etc to do something difficult/stupid/etc is a great way to access support from people who wouldn't donate off their own bat. A lot of the people who donate are generally just supporting their friend to achieve a personal goal. Occasionally you'll even get support from people who say they don't agree with or support the charity's mission, but they're more than happy to sponsor Tubby Jeff from IT for a tenner as he loses 4 stone and does the Three Peaks, because they know Tubby Jeff from IT.

Of course, if you don't want to support someone off on a ""jaunt"" then don't. Equally if you don't want to donate to your favourite charities, then don't.

true,Godhatesfats,null,null,"I'd like to add that it is my (perhaps unshared) opinion that our stadium is still built the way stadia are meant to be built: it's small; it's tight, you have barely any space for your legs; and the fans are very, very close to the pitch. Our 18200 fans make a hell of a lot more noise than the fans at some stadia that are 2x, or even more than that, the size of ours. 

I'm Swedish: I started supporting QPR when I moved to England, and at that time, QPR were in the shit: threat of relegation, liquidation and bankruptcy. I lived in the north of England then and got to see us play in some really crappy towns: Doncaster, Barnsley, Burnley, Scunthorpe, Blackpool, Preston... Those were unhappy days, but then came the good times. It seems almost absurd that I just happened to move to London as soon as we earnt our promotion to the PL. 

We had an absolutely superb season when we were promoted to the premier league. Taarabt was the vanguard of that promotion. I'm not expecting you to watch [all this shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpmvyu2VSfU&amp;list=PLE8D08EC35B3942FB&amp;feature=plpp_play_all), but you can skip to literally anywhere and you'll see Taarabt beasting. He had a poor start last year but he picked up a lot towards the end of last season. 

That improvement in form was much needed, as our run-in was hellish: Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal, WBA, Stoke, Swansea, United, Sunderland, Liverpool and City, in no particular order, from the top of my mind. No one was predicting we would stay up: but we beat Tottenham thanks to a Taarabt free kick, Liverpool thanks to turning a 2-0 deficit into a [3-2 win](http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2012/03/21/qpr-vs-liverpool-3-2-highlights-2012-derry-cisse-buzsaky-kuyt-coates-goals-video/) in the space of 12 minutes, we beat Arsenal at home too and perhaps most importantly, we beat Stoke thanks to an [89th minute Cissé goal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2waDz1DCWw&amp;feature=related), and despite losing at City, we managed to stay up by the skin of our teeth thanks to a draw between Stoke and Bolton, sending Bolton down in our place.

But now we're back, we're off to a pretty shit start after losing 5-0 at home to Swansea and it's likely to get worse as we play City, Chelsea and Tottenham in our next three games. Hopefully César can help us take at least a few points, as we're aiming for a mid-table finish this season :).

So this is how it all started, I used to play FIFA 98, way back when in 1998. Right, my team then was Liverpool. I'd always play as Liverpool. 

Cut to 2011, when I started playing Fifa again. After 13 long years. I started playing as Chelsea. Then Liverpool, etc etc. 

Now, everyone I used to play against was invariably either RM, Barca or MCFC. I was like, man, this MCFC is the most irritating team ever. I hate them and all the people who play as MCFC....


Then one day, I played as MCFC and was completely blown away by the bench strength that we have. Blown away. What an assembly of players this team has. I fell in love.

Went to the Etihad to watch the match against West Brom, we won 4-0. My first every match in a stadium. Awesome. Fell in love all over again.

Cried when we were losing on the last day. Anyway this is my team now. I've got tickets to tomorrows' match :-)

It has a population of around 100,000, yet it's still surrounded with greenbelt because it's in the northwest near Liverpool, Preston and Manchester. All the young people leave towns like this one because there is no university, no industry, no jobs, there's no future here. The only young people here are eastern European migrants, the only industry is the carehome industry and some leisure. It's a complete dump and I'm moving away too as soon as I can, probably to a population centre that is affected by greenbelt.

At no point have I even mentioned London, even the guy I originally responded to didn't mention London.

&gt;Does Britain build enough houses to give a growing population reasonable access to an affordable home? No, it doesn't. Average house prices are 6x average salaries, instead of 3.5x - the historical norm. Why?

House prices are retarded everywhere, but most people want to live in the economic centres. People gravitate to population centres, we have done since the industrial revolution. Seeing as how greenbelt effects the places where most people live and want to live, it's silly to say that greenbelt is irrelevant to a discussion about housing.

Sure we should build up although we did try that, again inthe 60s, and increasing density leads to lots of other problems like demand on infrastructure and crime. However flats are the worst selling types of property, nobody seems to want to buy them. Living in the city centre can be convenient for some so long as you've got parking,and all trends seem to point to the UK becoming more like continental Europe in that we'll be renting our homes rather than owning them. 

Still there are going to be people who want to raise their kids in a house with a garden and to be that nice little nuclear family, so building up isn't an option for them, and I don't really see why the market shouldn't be allowed to cater to that kind of demand just because some people want to appreciate privately owned land that nobody can build on.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"A landlady, not a Landlord. 

Couple moved in downstairs and brought cockroaches with them, within 3 months the place was completely infested. The landlady however refused to do anything about it  even after environmental control got involved. She lived there too in the ground floor flat. She was a completely useless lazy alcoholic.

Two of the other tenants moved out because of this and she let her completely untrained dogs run free around their flats and the rest of the house. 

The dogs then decided that these ( open ) flats would be a great place to use for a toilet which she blatantly refused to clean then up.

So... we had cockroaches and dog shit everywhere. Not a good look. 

After many arguments over this I lost it one day, took a bin bag and a mask, cleaned up all of the dog shit up and dumped the bag in front of her door in protest. The dogs then proceeded to rip the bag apart and drag the contents all over the hallway, which she also refused to clean up. 

I moved out not long after that. I knew I wasn't going to get my deposit back on this so I kept the last two months rent.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Charity is just a pathetic measure to placate the poor whilst reducing them to a state of guilty dependency.

It reminds me of one of the Victorian protest slogans: ""Give us back the common lands and you can keep your poor relief""

It's also just inefficient as Attlee found: 
&gt;""From 1906 to 1909, Attlee worked as manager of Haileybury House, a charitable club for working class boys in Stepney in the East End of London run by his old school. 

&gt;Prior to this, his political views had been conservative. However, he was shocked by the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with slum children. He came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty, and only massive action and income redistribution by the state would have any serious effect.""

It just leads to a patchy and unfair network of services so that someone in the North might have no provision whilst someone in the South has plenty, and also it is making fundamental human needs subject to the whim of the rich - who would often rather support an opera house or Eton College than a soup kitchen.

As for why we 'need' it in the first place:  [this comment](http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17740519) puts it better than I ever could.

To me the defining thing about charity is that it isn't aid between equals, there is someone who demeans themselves to receive it and someone who takes the glory of giving, it has a twisted moral sense to it so it carries guilt.

If you take a very restricted few of charity then you will only see it in the 'alms for the poor' that became necessary whenever people were stripped of the means to secure a livelihood for themselves, from serfdom to the Inclosures to modern wage labour.",0,1346423850,null,0,false,0,c61ghpo,t3_z4n65,t1_c61ghpo,t3_z4n65,null,1429782506,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,"&gt; it seems like a weird culture where people sideline what should actually be the focal point (the work of the charity, and what-not), for the slapstick or totally unrelated work of someone.

It is a bit of a wierd culture. The people who donate to Tubby Jeff's Three Peaks JustGiving Page *just* because they work with him and can see that he's making a real concerted effort to get fit, are partly missing the point. But they're missing the point in a profitable way. Events are a great way to raise awareness and therefore more funds/support, so most people raising the funds for a charity they like will try to spread the message. Not doing so kind of misses an opportunity.

It all seems a bit mercenary because... well, it is. Charities don't run for profit, most only have a few months to a year's worth of funds put aside for emergencies/etc and so they have to work constantly and consistently hard for every penny they can get. Of course, shoddy fundraising methods can damage a charity's image; I've seen what I consider to be some fucking shocking things - totally unrelated to my workplace - that have really put me off supporting a group.

&gt; I guess the real question is why do people have to be coaxed into donating to no-doubt good causes by financially inefficient displays of entertainment. 

Partly, I think, because money raised through events comes from a different group of people. This is where my knowledge gets fuzzy - I work in the handing-money-out side of things - but as I said above, the people who would happily donate without being coaxed do so anyway, purely on the strength of the charity's message, cause, etc. A lot of events money and the sponsorship that Tubby Jeff raises comes from people who might need a bit more persuasion to part with their hard-won cash, like a friend doing something difficult and out of character.

Another reason would be because events reach new people who might not have heard of the charity. Tubby Jeff might be really good at publicising his Three Peaks page on his twitter, blog, internal company intranet, noticeboards, the pub, etc... This is a lot of extra reach for a charity.

true,furiouspanda1,lancashire,Lancashire,"Having done a big charity thing which fits this bill, here's my perspective.

Overall, I found people are much less likely to donate spontaneously than they are if they're given a reason.  Whereas people *do* directly donate to causes, there's usually a reason behind it.  Either they've been directly affected by whatever that charity does, or they know someone who has.  It's very rare you'll get someone donating to a completely arbitrary charity out of pure altruism. As coldhearted as it sounds, it's just not the way we work.  As humans, we need a reason to part with our cash.  Yes, I understand that dying kids or sick donkeys **is** a fantastic reason, but we need something to bring that to our attention.  Something that we can relate with, and something we're happy supporting.

Even if that thing is completely unrelated to the charity, it still helps.  As an example, take the Poppy drive each year.  Your argument would suggest that we should scrap the paper poppies and just get people to donate.  It wouldn't work as well - people need some kind of tangible cause to part with their cash - *that's* what climbing Mt. Deathkill or jumping from the moon or eating a thousand hotdogs does.  It gives people that reason to donate their money in a way they're comfortable with.

If someone gets a fun experience out of it, then why not?  The charity are still collecting money they wouldn't otherwise see from people they wouldn't otherwise reach, everyone's a winner!

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"&gt; The article you posted is a clear example of how that landlord, and yourself, have no ability to reason with a situation. The course for renting out property is very simple: sign contracts, check references, acquire a security deposit.

I'm curious if you have ever rented property before or been a landlord? If you seriously believe that it's as simple as that you're sadly mistaken, consider what happens when things *do* go wrong. Even if you have a security deposit money doesn't solve every issue with no time investment, it can cover (most) costs associated with issues caused by tenants, but it certainly doesn't cover the cost of putting time into rectifying the issue.

My entire point revolves around the idea posted by E_mE, the idea that if a property is left empty because the owner doesn't live there then obviously that landlord is rich, and if they're not living there because of temporary personal choices (such as a holiday) or through a temporary change of circumstance (eg: being in hospital) then they should rent that property out and if they don't then it's fair game for squatters to take because they're refusing to occupy the property.

The idea that renting a property out is either a cheaper endeavour, or an endeavour that requires no time investment is completely wrong. Yes the example posted from the Dailymail is an extreme example that came with negligence on the part of the landlord but it's an example that being a landlord is not easy, it's not something that you can casually decide to do.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Firstly I made no comments about squatting.

Indeed - not aimed at you specifically, but your summary is being used generally in this thread as some sort of excuse to legitimise invading someone else's property in the first place.

&gt;Secondly those clearly were not in the context or theme of what I was going for.

This does not change your statement from being unfair and incorrect.

&gt;However in pure asset terms if you own/can afford a property in greater London you are basically asset rich by most standards across the country 

So if I owe £450K via a mortgage on a place, I'm still asset-rich? If I rent a Jaguar for a weekend, does that mean I'm rich because (for that weekend) I own a Jaguar? There's a difference between owning a place outright and owing a lot of money because you borrowed in order to buy it - both mean you're 'asset rich', but only one of them generally means you *might* have riches.

&gt;and if you can afford leave it unoccupied outside of a few specific circumstances such as sickness or while gathering death duties or some such thing you are richer still.

There's the rub - there are *lots* of circumstances that could put you in that position. That's not to say that there *aren't* any properties that are empty simply because someone wants to speculate on house prices, but even then; that doesn't mean they're rich. I could state that having the luxury of going on holiday means you're rich and can therefore afford another car, because I'll be taking yours - this is what happens if you allow others to determine how wealthy you are *by their standards*.

He has been my MP for my entire life, I've written to him 3 times and emailed him a dozen he has yet to write back to me, even when I supported him over more intelligent sentencing for prisoners rather than the normal right wing tory mandate of ""Lock 'em all up forver!"".

I know where his wife volunteers, I've seen him at the cricket and I know where he lives but I'm yet to be made angry enough to cross the line of allowing politicians the dignity and respect of a quiet private life away from their job (a bloke from 'fathers for justice' trespassed on to his property in a batman costume, all I could think was 'you prick'). Some of the draconian attempts at controlling the internet in the name of protecting children, piracy and terrorism may challenge this view. 

I'm tired of people in my area voting Tory because its what they've always done regardless of their awful, and I'm sick to death of hearing Clarke's apologists 'he's very liberal for a tory you know?' despite his years of service to the tobacco lobby. The first past the post system has essentially silenced the 60% of people in this constituency that don't vote for him like mortgage value obsessed zombies.

It's quite different from what I thought it would be, and really focuses in on how to actually create, balance and refine mechanics instead of programming. You actually aren't taught any programming language, and instead use 'MMF2' to create demos and ideas. 
It's a little jarring at first because it's not really used in the industry, but it is a great piece of software for quickly and efficiently portraying ideas and mechanics. It's also incredibly versatile, and it capable of doing pretty much anything outside of 3D. A lot of the course is  about how to create great, *original* games, as well as learning about how to get employed (70% employment rate last time I checked), and delving into the history and theory behind it. 

We also have a great bunch of lecturers with actual industry experience, and plenty of guest speakers including Peter Molyneux in the past. 

We also get access to a really great common room with a bunch of PCs and consoles in so it's really easy to meet other coursemates. I'd also recommend joining the Facebook groups and saying hi there!

It's a social nightmare.  However if i'm drunk then all bets are off and i always sit in the front and always talk bollox.   

As an aside but taxi related anecdote i once sold my car to a cab driver when drunk.  We were talking cars (being a ""safe"" topic with a cab driver, not like broaching the situation in the middle east) and when we pulled up i casually (as far as i remember) mentioned my car was for sale (it was).  He said he'd buy it, we didn't haggle (again as far as i can remember) he offered me near enough asking price and i accepted.  I told my wife on crawling into bed that ""iii fink iii've sold myyy carrr"" and then fell asleep.  Next day first thing in the morning the cab driver turns up (obviously he knew where i lived, directions or formal communication were unnecessary) with 3k in cash. I filled out the forms and handed over the keys.  It was all a bit weird, i couldn't help thinking i'd been conned but then i had the cold hard cash.  My wife was mildly amused and took the money off me, i went back to bed to sleep of my hangover.

Shops usually have better CCTV, the transaction can be stopped, shops take part of the risk, etc.

&gt;The limit is 250 quid so if you try to think what you need to spend a less exaggerated amount of money on then you might come up with a few things. Also banks are closed all day Sunday, not just Sunday night.

The limit is usually standard £250 however I know from having worked in a bank you can call and get this raised, usually to a higher limit of £500.

Most plumbings, men with vans, drug addictions, etc aren't going to cost more than £500 a day. And those that do I bet most would accept a £500 deposit.

There really is no need for an unlimited withdrawal. The other argument being ATMs can only be refilled so often, if the limit were raised and people took more out the ATM would be less useful to others. Of course this assumes more people would remove more money and thus there is a demand for this and so the bank should accommodate it and I successfully argue against my own point.

I have never come across the problem of hitting my withdrawal limit, I worked in a bank call centre for a few years and never had a customer complain about hitting a withdrawal limit and only a couple of times did they ask to increase it, which was done.

I don't really see any hypocrisy in what the 'PM' office boy tweeted.  If in one breath it is inspiring to see what people can overcome, then the next breath should be to re-evaluate disability benefit.  If someone is able to overcome disability then why should they be treated as if they still have it?  Certainly the ability to work with a wide range of disabilities has changed drastically in the last ten/fifteen years.


This government was been tasked to address a £150bn annual deficit.  As well as hiking capital gains, stamp duty, freezing pensions, raising the retirement age, creating fresh revenue streams, introducing a bank levy, making cuts, it'd be crazy if they didn't also look at one of their biggest expenditures: welfare.  Obviously there are going to be people that will need a little extra help, but I think it is fair to question that if people are getting their healthcare covered and can retrain why should they be treated any different?

true,the13thhour,null,null,"You are correct there, your history is still your history though it is lost to you through time travel. 

The Timelords and their relative point of temporal origin is actually hidden away for two reasons. Firstly through the action of time travel it is inaccessible to themselves, and through the creation of the Timelock it becomes inaccessible to everyone else. 

To travel to your own past is to destroy your future, as your own human writer Ray Bradbury displayed in his short story ""A sound of thunder"". 

I believe that we do not (and may never) know where in relative history the Timelords ascended on Gallifrey for one reason. They have been spoken of as ancient but this may not mean to say ""deep in the past"" as much as ""a very old culture"". They might have developed in the last four or nine billion years of time left in the universe, a single living culture that lasts eons, unchanged. This would make them ""ancient"" compared to humans even though they chronologically appear much later humans. Theoretically they could also have evolved and developed time travel very early in relative time, who could tell? In a way the Timelock makes Gallifrey and perhaps Skaro as well, places that exist completely out of time. Theoretically no part of the history of those worlds should be able to touch our universe, except for one thing because of this very specific case. In this case a part of that history (of both worlds) was standing on the other side of the gate when it closed, was in fact,the one responsible for closing it. 

If the Doctor lives, then Gallifrey can be freed, and as time travelers if they are ever free at all, they are always free throughout all time.  


The greater reality is that time, like some Gallifreyan writing, is circular. 

I have another theory. Once a time travelling race exists, in a universe where causality shows this much wibble given enough force applied at the proper point, they are destined to alter their own history and so rewrite it, either directly or indirectly.
The Doctor will go home some day and Gallifrey will begin again as it has many many times before.

Basically, the reason for vilifying the Prime Minister and bashing him over this tweet is simply that all of these athletes are disabled (thus can participate in these games) but if they were in the system none of them would be eligible for any assistance because they're para-olympians and thus not disabled.

Lots of Liverpool fans have been in touch, asking for news on Clint Dempsey and Daniel Sturridge. To be honest, if the Reds don't sign a striker soon they will be in touch asking if there is any news about signing Dean Sturridge.

Anyway, don't despair Reds fans. Brendan Rodgers has been seen leaving the club's Melwood training ground but that does not mean he is going home to watch Ice Road Truckers.

Before he left, Rodgers said: ""The business people at the football club are looking to put deals in place. As a manager and a coach the earlier you can get it done the better. But I've always said if we can get the players we want in by the end of the window then I can be happy. There's still a bit of time left and a bit of work to do, and hopefully we can get things done.""",0,1346434109,null,0,false,0,c61jax4,t3_z4nte,t1_c61jax4,t3_z4nte,null,1429783830,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

It's essentially the means to those ends out parties often disagree about. Every party in this country is so center you could easily swap half the MP's about.

He's functioned best slightly behind a striker in a forward partnership and can be cover for Gylfi in that role if we continue a 4-2-3-1. However, AVB hinted at a possible system change to his preferred 4-3-3 at his press conference yesterday (which I believe hinges on the Moutinho transfer, but could happen regardless with the Dembele addition). In my opinion, he can be emergency cover in the midfield in a 4-3-3 but I think he'd be best as cover/starting as the lone forward with Adebayor, especially with Dembele in that 3 man midfield.

Skydiving has nob all to do with any charity but if I have costs of £150 to pay for the skydive + promotion and I get someone to raise a minimum £500, which often turns out to be more, then we get £350 we wouldn't have otherwise. That person would struggle to raise £350 / £500 whatever it is without some kind of incentive / reward whatever you want to call it and almost definitely wouldn't have that themselves. People generally get sponsored to do something difficult (marathons) or something others wouldn't want to do (bungee jumping) and it is a great vehicle to raise cash that wouldn't happen otherwise. Charities are essentially selling experiences. I've done it, I didn't have the cash to pay for a skydive, but knew I could raise fund from friends and family and raise a few hundred for a good cause too, everyone wins. Charities are not shy that they have costs, just ask them. All fundraising comes at a cost whether it is people in the street, tv adverts, cake sales or anything else and it works.

Mickey was a nobody. By the end of his run, he was a hardened badass who'd seen the front lines of war. He went from being a push-around boyfriend who didn't even belong in his own relationship, to finding himself (taking Ricky's place), and then returning to a home/universe where he didn't have anyone left.  

Martha was probably the most capable of the new companions on her way, except emotionally she wasn't very far ahead where Mickey was at the start. She loved her family, but they weren't the best fit for her. She traveled with the Doctor, but where she would have come into her own was when she traveled the world alone for a year. After leaving the Doctor, she had a very hands-on role in UNIT (where presumably Mickey joined her after he came back to this universe).  

Mickey has no one besides his new friends and colleagues in UNIT. Rose was gone and his gran is dead. Even Jacky's on the other side too. He's in a completely different world than he used to be, and it's not like he could just call up his old mates from school the way he used to. Things are different now.   

Martha didn't fit with her fiance (forget his name) either. All the stuff she'd seen and done, she can't tell him. He'd think she was crazy; it's not like she could even prove it to him. He doesn't know this huge thing about her that her entire life is based around. 

Mickey and Martha, they're working together, fighting together, protecting the Earth. They know what it's like, they get it. They get each other.

I don't think for a second they focussing on making lives worse, and I wouldn't make a statement assuming these people already have 'shit lives'.

As for ""there aren't enough jobs for the fit people"", I'm going to come out and say that in many cases disabled people may be considered equally 'fit' to do a job.   Some jobs they'd be ruled out of, some jobs their disability won't make any difference.  There is also an aspect of a victim complex because for centuries people who couldn't find a job made a job, and it's a dynamic that has been embraced by countless immigrants spanning generations.  It's also never been cheaper or easier to set up a business in the internet age.

&gt;But selling it wouldn't produce more food for them in itself. If we already have the food and means available then that is a separate problem.

&gt;Besides, one act of charity does nothing to solve the systemic problems.

One act of breaking and entering and squatting does nothing to solve the systemic problems either (a lack of affordable housing and homeless accommodation).

&gt;But there's a difference with denying people access to the Earth's land and resources by private property, which no-one has any right to.

I don't agree. Humanity lives by a system of land and property rights which are consented to by every democratic society (and most non-democratic ones). People aren't denied access to land, but if they want to do something then they shouldn't be doing it on someone else's property.

&gt;It's certainly not the choice of most people. We spend our entire lives working, giving up the vast majority of our life to it, and the value of our work to the shareholders and landlords.

So don't? I'm not sure what you're unhappy about here. If you don't like that then become a shareholder or a landlord.

Saying it has been marked up by over 50% is not misleading when it was at 18% for the rich, and now it is at 28%.  That is an over 50% increase.

Interest rates are having to be kept low because of the austerity measures, because they're having to reduce a deficit at a time of economic downturn so the debt can be serviced.  The BoE might set interest rates but they do so as a reflection of government action, and it's that action that's hitting savings.  

&gt;Thats an obvious statement. Austerity affects everyone. That isn't the point being debated. Exactly how is it the rich are being taxed ""a lot more"" than under Labour?

Nobody who is not in the lower income income brackets is getting taxed at 18% any more, they're now on 28%.

Landlord would turn up unannounced, just let himself in with a key. Central Heating packed up in the dead of winter, he couldn't be arsed to fix it. When i called out British Gas to repair the hot water, he went mental, telling us we'd be liable for the bill.

Wallpaper peeling in the bathroom &amp; back bedrooms, black mould &amp; water staining in them as well. Master Bedroom had rotten windowframes and he wouldn't replace them. Carpet Tread came off on day 2 of our tenancy and we got shouted at for that, too.

Cooker was a festering disgrace, should have been condemned. Freezer smelled of rotten food, despite it being cleaned thoroughly. 

The phone wiring in the house was a nightmare, old, shitty stuff from the days of the rotary dial phone. Took a BT engineer three DAYS to figure it out and plumb in DSL. We lived nearly opposite the exchange and could barely get 5mbps. 

Despite this we cleaned the place from top to bottom before moving out. We never got any deposit back due to 'extensive property damage' - all his fault for refusing to acknowledge the damp/rot etc - we got a little bit of our own back by posting him a shoebox full of cat shit with a note saying 'if you're keeping our deposits, here's another deposit you can keep'.

It was one in a million. 

This miserable excuse of a performance the first half justifies everything I've privately thought here. The manager is responsible for inspiring the players. They put out a performance as lackadaisical and lazy as any of the worst ones I saw under AVB. They didn't give a shit, and that was compounded by the fact that the tactical setup stacked with creative but not-hardworking players left us with insufficient holding mids leaving us completely vulnerable on the break. I could have put out a better fucking XI. We don't need a manager who gets sacked by West Brom. The very best managers always do well, even if they are at a small club. Di Matteo wasn't some diamond in the rough--he is a small fish who was in the right place at the right time. We need one of the top 5 managers in the world, if we want to genuinely compete against the worlds best. Mediocre managers do not win championships. Pep or Mou for me, that's it.

I'm trying to break this down as logically as possible for myself...

* LFC needs a goal scorer.
* We've identified Dempsey as a player we want.
* Dempsey doesn't want to stay at Fulham (he's essentially downed tools).
* Dempsey wants to go to Liverpool and not, say, Aston Villa.
* Can Fulham afford to have a Tevez-like situation? Likely not.
* Can Liverpool afford to do nothing else as the window closes? Likely not.
* At the end of the day, the clubs are quibbling over a few million quid.

Seems to me that LFC/FSG want to change the perception that we're suckers who will overspend and Fulham don't want to seem like they've just given away their best player for peanuts.

I *have* to imagine at the end of the day, Clint Dempsey will be in a Liverpool FC shirt.

The fact that his government (and the previous one) was happy to piss away money on anything and everything didn't help (billions spent on ID cards, tons spent on fire control rooms, why? that's the tip of the iceburg), neither did his absolute incompetence, neither did Labour's need for surveillance of everything. Labour were in power for 13 years and they needed to go.

There were and still are a lot of reasons not to vote Labour, more than I have listed. I don't support the Conservatives and I don't support some of the things they are doing, but I would definitely consider voting for them before I vote for Labour. (my actual political leanings are closer to the Lib Dems but I didn't vote for them in 2010 either)

I don't rate Brown's financial acumen whatsoever. Darling I have some time for, but you could see that he mostly had his hands tied by Brown.

BTW - calling them toffs is quite immature. You're aware that there's very little of the Labour front bench that hasn't had a privileged start in life? (and unfortunately too many politicians are in it for a career and all have PPE degrees from Oxford or Cambridge, but that's a cross party issue).

I also seem to recall that under Labour the rot started regarding private involvement in the NHS, they also demolished the remnants of the grant system for university education, brought in fees, hiked up the fees, and then commissioned the report that recommended £9k fees today. Labour also contracted with Atos in 2005 for the services they are criticised for today - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/atos-contract-does-not-offer-value-for-money-says-national-audit-office-8056412.html",0,1346444137,null,0,1346444478,0,c61m3k1,t3_z4zon,t1_c61m3k1,t1_c61l7pi,null,1429785218,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Dempsey will help with the clubs popularity in the States, but it is going to be limited going by how well supported Fulham is over there. Also, while there is no doubt he is popular, he isn't going to help sustain popularity as he has a maximum of 3 years left. Still, there will be some financial benefits. 

Now, let's move to value to the club as per on the pitch. There is no guarantee that Dempsey is going to perform well at Liverpool. Carroll didn't perform at Liverpool after scoring 11 goals in half a season. Downing didn't perform at Liverpool despite being relatively consistent in his career. 

The club is owned by some of the most astute business minds around. It is currently being managed by one of the most highly rated managers in the Premier League from last season.

true,spudboyblues,present,Mata,"Right. Well. Here goes:

Pretty shit game all 'round. Starting at the back: Cahill and Luiz looked lost. Without the leadership of Terry, the defense looked in shambles. The two of them couldn't communicate, but it didn't help that Luiz was stumbling over balls. The Geezer left his head in London, it seemed. Awful game for him. But the fourth goal, I think, epitomized the entire game for us at the back. Set piece into the box, AND EVERYBODY STOOD STILL. Nobody attacked the ball, we looked like statues. Piss poor. 

CDMs: Mikel had an okay game, but was oftentimes overwhelmed by the pace of the Madrid players. He certainly couldn't keep up and was made to look clumsy by their skill. There wasn't much he could do, really, because Lampard...can't believe I'm writing this...really had an awful game. I hardly heard his name mentioned by the announcers. He was never on the ball, he wasn't back helping transition, and more often then not was up with Torres, offering no link between defense and attack. And as a result Mikel was swarmed and a lot of our possession was cut off. Meireles looked excellent last game, and to be honest, Lampard didn't even come close to pulling off the double pivot as well as he did. This should be a concern going forward for the team. 

Attacking Mids: Weren't helped by the Mikel/Lampard situation. Because Mikel was left isolated in the midfield, there was no transition play and no way for attacks to develop. The attacking half of the team played as such. They looked stifled, and gave away possession incredibly quickly, which is something that will have to be worked on. It's clear that there is potential, but that the players haven't quite gelled as much as our first three results might have suggested. 

Lastly, Torres did look active, but with everything else falling apart he didn't really get any service or any chances on the ball. He was tracking back to help defend, which is more than I can say for Lampard. As an aside, the ref today was fucking terrible. 0 consistency between fouls, and I thought he had several missed calls. 

TL;DR: Lots of work to do. Hope this is a big wakeup call and we go on to kick the living shit out of QPR. Forwards have to gel, we still need Captain Leader Legend, and that fucker Falco (nice work, American commentators) is an absolute beast. He's the real deal. /rant. That was an aggravating two hours.

&gt;This is my letter, based on a previous comment here, in particular having added a point about being an IT professional.

&gt;&gt;I am raising my concerns about the proposal for network filtering of adult content and default blocking.

&gt;&gt;I don't believe that this bill is at all a necessary or effective step to protect children from pornographic images. There are many effective programs available, both free and commercial, that a parent can use to block these images while their child is on the internet.

&gt;&gt;I also know that any such block performed by a ISP is rendered useless with a quick google search. Take for example the block placed on The Pirate Bay; after the block was implemented TPB received millions of new hits. The block was immediately rendered useless and the money spent implementing it completely wasted.

&gt;&gt;As an IT professional, I know that there is no effective filtering solution for any content - there will be both a false positive rate of legitimate information that becomes inaccessible, and false negatives where something within the scope is overlooked - the latter also prompts complaints if parents see this proposed system as a replacement for their own responsibility when it inevitably misses something. I must also reiterate my previous point here, that any system takes minimal technical knowledge to circumvent, and that children will always be curious - if something is blocked, they will not give up but will redouble their efforts to access it and ultimately succeed. Pretending to children that adult material does not exist is not a valid strategy compared to education and promoting understanding.

&gt;&gt;In addition, censorship is vulnerable to scope creep - once such a far-reaching and comprehensive system is in place, it will become too easy for organisations to lobby for their own views to be enforced on others who do not share them.

&gt;&gt;I believe it is the parent's responsibility to know what their child is doing on the internet and to educate them about these images and why they exist. Money and time would be better spent teaching children about the images they will inevitably encounter rather than ineffectively trying to shield them from them. Such a system will promote a false sense of security among non-technically minded parents - they will think it can do their job for them while this is not the case.

&gt;&gt;Parents should not try to offload their own responsibility for their children onto others - the internet is not a babysitter, much like TV is not, and if they feel their children may access something they consider inappropriate, they should be actively involved to prevent that - this goes for any media, be it television, the internet, radio, books, or any other.

&gt;&gt;Finally, I believe it is incredibly unfair to place tens of millions of grown adults into the position of having to make a potentially embarrassing phone call to their ISP simply to negate a block a vocal minority with many other options wants.",0,1346446411,null,0,false,0,c61mphp,t3_z4p40,t1_c61mphp,t3_z4p40,null,1429785506,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"Wow, I'm late to throw my two cents into the ring, but my thought on your question is that it's a bit strange that the main/official *Doctor Who* subreddit was 99% made up of memes and 1% of discussion. 

Both forms of expression are celebrations of the show, and I'd be okay with memes existing, in proportionate regulation with discussion. Unfortunately, this precedent has shown that won't happen, as it's easier to post a Rainy 10th Doctor picture than, say, talk about whether the Valeyard will really make a reappearance in the series (my money is on no). 

Since /r/doctorwho is ostensibly the first place that people will go to for *Doctor Who* on reddit, I like the idea for the subreddit to offer *both* an outlet for creative expression and discussion. It always seemed strange to me that if a newcomer wanted to *talk* about *Doctor Who* on reddit, they were better served by going to a smaller, off-shoot subreddit, than attempting to get a conversation going on the larger subreddit, only for it to be buried by countless reposts of the ""Does time always pass this slowly?"" image macro. 

Now, instead of us always telling people ""Go to /r/gallifrey instead"", we can say, ""Yeah, sure, post your question or idea to /r/doctorwho. There's actually a chance it will be seen now.""

It's hard not to blame Kenny.

Kenny and Comolli set this club back multiple years with those signings. Because if you look at what H+G did, they spent huge their first summer as well before going back to the 12m/summer game. Luckily Rafa bought decent players that one big summer...Torres, Skrtel, Babel, Benayoun. But Kenny+Comolli wasted that opportunity on complete shit British players. Now the owners have a bitter taste at basically wasting that money, and are reluctant to spend again.

It would have been nice to get Dempsey but at the same time it probably wasn't the smartest move if we are planning for the future. We brought in 3 young forwards--Borini, Assaidi, and Yesil--who still have their future ahead of them. Not to mention Sterling and Morgan who obviously have great futures. Then we added Joe Allen to our midfield with Shelvey and Henderson. And we could see Sahin join permanently as well.

We don't need Walcott or Dempsey on this team. We need to focus on building around youth and let them be the ones to put us back into the top 4.

After watching the game tonight, I can't help but wonder which of these trophies are we actually &amp; seriously in contention for. 

Half-hearted defense, disjointed offense, missing midfield and a keeper who looked completely isolated/lost off his line when Atleti counter-attacked. 

How can you allow Atleti to have a 5v3 on the counter? How can you have 7 players on offense, 3 on defense and none bothering to track back? How can you allow Falcao the time and space to look at the goal, line up his shot and time his kick when you are standing a few yards away? Heck, how can you allow ANY of the opposition players ANY amount of time on the ball when they have scored just 7 minutes into the game? What? They were faster? Well, you were STRONGER. Or, at least, you were supposed to be. What happened to the concepts of marking and pressuring your opposition into misplacing the pass? Wasn't this the same defense that stood rock-solid against Bayern &amp; Barca? What happened?

Oh, this was a glorified friendly? WRONG. 

This was a trophy, a piece of silverware we were hoping you'd bring home - symbolic though it may have been/seemed. Actually, more than the trophy itself, it was the bragging rights we were looking forward to. (Yeah, we're kinda pathetic and selfish that way.) It was a hope that we'd finally get the haters to stop with all the 'anti-football' and 'parking-the-bus' drivel and show them that we play football the way it should be played - tactically &amp; smartly.

More important - I'm diagnosed Aspergers (since 2001, when I was 30) so I'm pretty aware of social incompetence jokes. Sometimes I get pissed off, of course, but guess what my favorite kind of jokes is...

If social incompetence is a symptom of a disability, and disability jokes are discrimination jokes, and discrimination jokes are evil, can anyone tell me *any* kind of humor that is funny to anyone yet never risks causing offense to someone?

Maybe we'd better ban all those socially awkward penguin memes for a start? Or maybe not.

I think it was the South Park guys who said if anything is valid, it's all valid. Personally, I agree.

Sure, that means that racist and disablist and everything-ist views get aired. But that's a fact of life anyway. You can't solve prejudice by restricting freedom of speech - people will find a way to spread their hate, but along the way you've given the authorities excuses to restrict freedom of speech, and you can be damn sure they'll find a way to abuse that.

OTOH, e.g. racist humor can also ridicule the racists - for an example, see [Alf Garnett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Garnett).

Basically - feel free to get pissed off, that's freedom of speech too, but don't ban it.

Everyone is remembering Dembele's great game against United and his good game from two weekends ago. That's fine, but that's his *best*, he won't always play like that. Even on his best day he still falls a bit short of Modric. 

Dempsey is underwhelming. He'll sell a lot of jerseys in the US, expand the US fanbase, and be cover for the wings and AM (maybe even striker). He wasn't crucial, though. I would be happy with this signing if we had closed on Moutinho. 

Lloris was a good signing. It's not often a superb, world-class keeper is willing to come to you for such a low fee without CL play. This should have been closed.

Gylfi was also a great signing, similar to Lloris in that he young, but already a great player, with room for imporvement as well.

Verts is a brilliant signing as well, one of the best we made I feel.  Played very well last week and should be a starter for the long term.

Dembele was also a nice pickup, and has the versatility to play the deep-lying role or play a more advanced role, depending on how AVB lines us up.

I feel like we're all a little disappointed with Dempsey,, if only because we see him as a reactive buy after Moutinho fell through.  If you look at it as a stand alone deal though, great value for the money.  He's consistently improved over his time in England, and though I doubt he'll better his year last season, I think he's got the experience to be a great addition.

ALL OF THEM!(Even considering Suarez's amazing performance he was gone for 8 games)) We don't see the full effect of financial side such as total number of money we paid vs what we have accumulated based on the players we purchased alone. Salaries we pay out make our 16 mil signing of Henderson look like a walk in the park. 

Hence what we have done in the window was get rid of that burden. Carroll was the ONLY signing we should have (arguably) kept based on the shortage of strikers. I would give away the rest just like BR did just to rebuild the squad. This year is transition stage and everything else is a bonus. There are way more positives than one loss of Dempsey and shortage of a striking force right now. Fans (me and you) want instant impact, but sometimes being patient is all we can do.

I think the whole team just mentally signed-off after Falcao's hat-trick. We really should have lost 6-1 or 7-1, judging by their missed sitters and our defensive woes. 

Mikel has improved by leaps and bounds in this off-season. I'd like to see him paired with Meireles/Ramires more regularly in the future.

Lamps, on the other hand, has gone the opposite way. He still considers himself an attacking midfielder and refuses to adapt to the (defensive/holding) midfield role. If he continues to play like he did today, he will cause some major heartburn to a lot of us in the future.

We need a leader on the pitch when JT is off it - someone (anyone?) the team looks up to, someone (anyone?) who can command the lines and order the silly little fucks around. Lamps isn't a leader.

  - Spend money on players for the future to build into the system.

I'll admit that I was made to look foolish by predicting Oxford to win last time, but I'm struggling to see a Leeds win tomorrow - even at home. I say this because Blackburn actually seem like a similar team to us: they get ahead with a goal (more often than not through luck, some people have been saying) and they seem to be hard to break down. This is why I could easily see both teams cancelling each other out, or Leeds going ahead and getting pulled back. The latter seems quite likely with Rovers signing Jordan Rhodes. He probably won't start - I don't think he's had more than a day's training with his new team - but I highly suspect that he'll be on the bench and I have a sneaky feeling that he'll just get on the end of a flick-on at the end of the game and score.

I'll go for 1-1.

Here's the Leeds team I'm predicting; for shortness, it's pretty much the first-choice with Brown in for Norris - whom I suspect might be out for this game (though I wouldn't mind: I think Brownie can fill in for a couple of games and Austin was immense in a more advanced role!) - and Diouf on the wing.

&gt; What is the 'deal sheet'?
The deal sheet was introduced two years ago. Clubs sometimes conclude deals at the last minute and it is not always easy for them to get everything completed and sent over by 11pm. The deal sheet allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached in order to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation.
The sheet cannot be used prior to 9pm and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes. Once the sheet arrives, clubs have got until 1am in which to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, it still has to comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"Listen, it's bad. We have no strikers in the squad. Let's hope we get at least a little money in the January window in case we need someone (Walcott/Sturridge). Until then, we may sign a free agent but I think Rodgers will expect Yesil and Morgan to step up. Also, I can only hope that Rodgers starts play Gerrard in the false 9 role rather than Suarez. As good of a play as Suarez is, I truly believe Stevie is a better finisher. He'll have a midfield of Sahin, Allen, Hendo/Shelvey behind him so it's safe to play him up there unlike last year.

But, to be honest, we've had a pretty good transfer window. We've picked up Allen (for cheap it's looking like with his quality), Sahin (sure it's a loan, but he'll be immense for us this year), Assaidi (reports from Melwood say he's faster than Sterling), Yesil (sure he's young but he was given a first team squad number at Bayer, perhaps he is ready), and Borini (makes good runs, feel like he needs a couple goals to get going). Also, we've cut anywhere from 250k-350k from the wage bill. I'm sure we'll find a way to compete, but I just can't see this being a top four type of season unless Suarez goes on an absolute tear, which I do believe he is capable of doing.

Edit: Oh, and on another note, last summer's transfer window set us back ridiculously. This years window, I believe, helped us. Now teams know that we don't have money to waste. It could be a blessing in disguise, but it's looking more and more unlikely that we'll win that trophy for Stevie...",0,1346454921,null,0,1346455398,0,c61oqs9,t3_z5q33,t1_c61oqs9,t3_z5q33,null,1429786465,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

We've lost/got rid off 10 players; Adam, Aurelio, Bellamy, Carroll, Darby, Kuyt, Maxi, Toni Silva, Eccleston, Spearing. And Aquaman. 

Bought in 5 new guys; Allen, Assaidi, Borini, Yesil. Plus Joe Cole and Pacheco returning from loan and Sterling/Morgan possibly becoming regular first teamers. 


To be honest the only thing that has annoyed me is getting rid of Carroll. If we had kept him (or at least signed a replacement) then I'd say this was a good transfer window. 

But the fact is we didn't. We let Andy go without having a striker guaranteed to take his place. We should never have done that. And there was no reason to from what I can tell. It's just sloppy and very amateur. So for that I am disappointed. God knows how Andy must feel. It's like we're saying having no striker is better than having him in the team. 

The Dempsey deal should have been sorted weeks ago - if that was road the club wanted to go down. We should have learnt from when we lost Torres on the last day and panic bought Carroll that we should have used the time to set up backup plans.

Still we have Suarez and Borini who are capable of scoring. And some promising youngsters in Yesil, Morgan and maybe even Ngoo. Plus Pacheco and Cole are still around so could be some use to us if they sort themselves out. 

Basically what I'm saying is while it's not ideal (An injury/ban to Suarez could be deadly) it's not the end of the world. 

And on the plus side we've bought in some great players like Allen and Sahin and  kept hold of Agger, Skrtel, Sterling and Suso. 

And it wouldn't surprise me if we did end up with Owen (or even Fowler?) on a pay as you play contract. Not sure how I'd feel about that though... :\",0,1346455695,null,0,false,0,c61ox31,t3_z5q33,t1_c61ox31,t3_z5q33,null,1429786547,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

true,YNWAlone,null,null,"Absolutely right .. And what we  have now is (I assume) mutual understanding that club just fell short of funds asked for Dempsey. No doubt Carroll was a gamble, a player that was a huge investment and that wants to play who doesn't fit the style of BR, for a player that does fit for a reasonable offer/wage. Given that next year our financial position should be better than now it was a risky but probably well planned move. What I recon happened is fulham saw right through it and fucked us over on the required down payment.

According to reports they have asked us for more than spurs or villa. Given dempseys desire to move here an our constant chase they decided to screw us over. As far as putting out extra funds to transfer I can imagine a call was made and a firm NO came from the owners. Reason? I can only speculate is that after paying off Kenny and getting BR they have established a rigid budget and possibly have pushed the boundaries already with purchase of Allen. That's why the loan of Carroll. it's all about freeing funds and playing on the edge. I can't blame FSG for sticking to their budget, god knows they lost hugely last season, I can only blame fulham and a risky move that didn't pay out. On the other hand if it did I would look back at it with pride for our managerial team!

I think we had an above average window. We brought in some depth, brought in some great young players, dropped the average age of our squad by at least a couple years. We have some great new talents and we loaned out some players that really need first team play. Moutinho was a necessity but since that's fallen through I think we need to put all our faith in AVB and hope he'll be able to make it until January with what we have now. 

Then again, Dembele could turn out to be better than Moutinho. We'll just have to wait and see.

I know keeper wasn't an ""immediate"" concern, but how would we have felt if (forbid) Brad picked up an injury this season and we all had to watch Gomes trot out there. I don't want those days back. Fantastic investment.

I think we have already seen some great quality from Vert. It is easy to get swept up in the deadline day drama and forget that we added him and Siggy long ago. Siggs showed great quality at Swans even if he hasn't impressed here yet. Hopefully he can mitigate the loss we feel for Van der Vaart.

Ade isn't a change from last year, but getting him back was pretty big even if it wasn't exciting.


Let me mention that Modric was my favorite Spur. Everyone is stuck in this mindset that ""we need to replace Modric."" Yeah we need a CM, but we don't need the exact same thing. I haven't seen him much, but it sounds like Dembele could bring creativity and extra solidity to our midfield.

Finally, Demps. Uhhh, I can't explain it. Why am I not excited that we just grabbed a player who netted 23 goals last year, and we got him on the cheap? I'm thinking that AVB might try him in Lennon's spot. Demps could spend most of his time closer to the center with midfield/walker covering duty by the line. Has negative and positive potential.
