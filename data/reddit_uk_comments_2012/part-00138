(Amniocentesis may only be safely performed after the 15th week, though sometimes earlier at the 12th or 13th.)

The good news is that we finally have subs like Marin and Oscar. With that being said the same could happen to Barca as it already has with Pique and Puyol being out with injury.

Just a lot of things. It just really, really seemed that the Doctor had some specific knowledge about their futures that no one else had access to. It doesn't make sense that it wasn't addressed in TATM, but it would be lazy writing if all that turned out to be nothing. 

Just my opinion, though!

&gt; but it sounds like you are one of those twats who sail along in the first overtaking lane thinking that it is the lane for people doing seventy, that the lane to your left is for lorries, and the one to your right is for speeders.

No. I stay in the slow lane when it is free and I don't have to constantly slow down to pull out because no one keeps even close to a safe stopping distance.

&gt; and if you compound that by leaving such a massive gap that somebody can undertake you, you are being an even bigger twat.

Three words, safe stopping distance. Do you know what they mean? Read the highway code.

I’m afraid it just won’t happen. Why would he want to leave? Chelsea have had a great start to the season, if they continue into Christmas they will be in the running alongside Utd and City. He knows this, so why would he leave what he left Liverpool for? Competing for honours! He has a chance to win the league. And then there is the other thing, Champions League.
As much as LFC need him, he doesn’t need them anymore.
I have no doubt he loved playing for Liverpool, but, like it or not, he made a smart career choice and he saw that leaving LFC to be the best thing for his career. He isn’t Gerrard, born and bread Liverpool, he left his boyhood club to move to the Prem and win honours, if he could have done it with Atletico then he would have stayed there. And lets face it, Atletico look more likely to win something than Liverpool do. If he will ever leave Chelsea, it will be to go back to his team, Atletico Madrid.
Im a Liverpool fan just being realistic.

EDIT what I forgot to say was, Rush, Fowler and Bellamy all left reluctantly under far different circumstances and when Liverpool have been at their best.
Rush – Sold to Juve to try and heal some of the Haisel wounds
Fowler – Sold to Leeds after bust up with Phil Thompson
Bellamy – Sold to West Ham after bust up with Riise and being surplus to requirements.

We're told that everyone will feel the strain - but it's common sense to realize that those with less will feel the weight of cuts more than those who have more. That's not spin... it's simple logic. 

That's not to say the benefits system in its current guise is perfect. 

However to stand before a nation where so many are feeling the weight of the price of petrol, housing, unchecked utility costs and so on and so on - and to say that another £10bn needs to be found from the benefits end of things - is nothing short of a kick in the teeth. 

Unless you're about to argue that being a millionaire is a difficult lifestyle, I think a great many would agree that folks at *that* end of things should feel a squeeze before everyone else - the premise being that they can afford to live more modestly, more easily, where others are planning their car journeys so as to conserve fuel.

For example, if I think it's funny to dress in a nazi uniform and recite a Hitler speech at a Jewish funeral... should I be permitted to under the guise of free speech?

There is no such thing as 'free speech' because people have a right to live in peace without fear of emotional abuse; a joke like this while it may not offend the masses could be seen as emotional abuse on those who care for and love this little girl.

One local told the BBC that on the day following a defeat of the English football team by their German counterparts, ferry workers had let cars bearing German registration plates travel for free. In the bridge's first year of operation it recorded traffic of 612,000 vehicles, a third more than the ferry's official numbers.

1.  Find someone else to buy with.  If you haven't got a partner, see if any of your friends want to go in with you.  You will be doubling your income at a stroke, allowing a bigger mortgage.  If you are buying with a friend, see a solicitor and get agreements done in a legally binding fashion.

2.  Location is everything.  Look for locations that are currently under the average price but are in up-and-coming areas.  You might have to live in a bit of a shit area for a while, but if the area is improving it'll be worth it.  Once you own a house, rising house prices are your friend.  Every 1K increase in your house's price is another 1K on the deposit for your next house.

3.  Move when the opportunity presents itself.  Bear in mind that the costs of moving could be around 15K, but if the right house in the right location comes up, don't be afraid to move to take advantage of it.  Keep a constant eye on the market.  If you feel the time is right to move, make friends with estate agents that deal with the sort of houses you want to find out about a new instruction before anyone else.

4.  Buy knackered houses.  Do them up while you live in them, doing as much as you can yourself.  It's hard work but buying a crap house in a good area moves you up the ladder.  This can be difficult as knackered houses are popular with builders and developers.  This might not be possible with your first house as you need money to do them up with and banks aren't willing to lend over the sale price to people with small deposits.  See point 2 for how to increase your deposit.

5.  Mortgage yourself up to the hilt.  As long as you have enough money to avoid defaulting, you can live on beans on toast for a few years.  As time goes on, inflation will make your mortgage payments effectively shrink.

6.  Be willing to live in squalor and poverty, labouring every night after a full day's work, for the sake of a comfortable life later on.

This is basically what worked for us.  As I said, I'm earning 28K, the wife is currently in full time education and we are about to sell our house for 368K.

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;The amount of young, jobless potheads littering my city versus the genuinely unemployed, seeking work people. That's evidence. 

So you've counted them then? How many of each?

&gt;The unemployed mother that lives nearby, hanging out of her flat window at 7am smoking a joint while her 3 year old (inside the flat!) cries for attention and food.

Anecdote.

&gt;If you had ever had a taste of actual jobless UK, you'd see that there's not much else to do except get high.

Grew up and still live in one of the most deprived areas in the country. 

&gt;If you're an unemployed pot smoker that took offence to my comment, maybe you should take a look in the mirror instead of attacking my view of the country.

Nope, happily employed professional and regular toker - and I know many others just like me. I simply take offence to the 'hurr lazy pothead' stereotype that Daily Mail types like you bandy about so often.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"A DNA server? How futuristic...     

Unblock US is a web-proxy service. You point your computer to DNS servers that they operate; these DNS servers then send requests directed at Netflix.com to servers operated by Unblock themselves. Unblock then forward your requests to the real Netflix.com but it appears as if it comes from a US localised IP address (so instead of You-&gt;Netflix, it goes You-&gt;Unblock-&gt;Netflix).    

Upside of this is:    

 - It is easy to set up    
 - It works on damn near all devices (e.g. consoles, TVs, whatever)    
 - It is relatively inexpensive ($5/month)    

Downside:     

 - It won't work as universally as a VPN (i.e. it works for sites that they support, like Netflix, but it won't work for all US restrictive sites or services, a VPN will)     
 - Your privacy and security is potentially being violated (i.e. they can see everything you send, including passwords, and they can alter what is returned from the sites. This impacts more than just Netflix as you're using their DNS servers).     
 - One day Netflix MIGHT crack down on people logging into Netflix US with Netflix UK accounts (i.e. You're at risk of having your account terminated; but that is entirely speculation).    

I myself won't use Unblock US because I simply don't trust them. But the same is true for VPN hosts. You have to trust the route your traffic travels, or else you cannot use any secure sites (e.g. read e-mail, login to Reddit, whatever).     

I operated my own VPN server in the US and log into that. It is more expensive but I also don't have to worry about my security or privacy. I use Amazon EC2 right now so it is free for the first year.    

I will entirely grant that for the technically illiterate Unblock US is much much easier to use than a VPN. Like night and day easier. VPNs are a PITA at the best of times (even if you DO know what you're doing).    

I would also recommend Strong VPN as an alternative. They charge you $7/month. You get a fully comprehensive VPN service but even with them consider the privacy/security parts I said above.

I've used both BT and Virgin. Not Bethere, but I did look into it. Virgin is cheaper because I wanted TV too.


If you have a cable line (i.e. virgin) you don't need any kind of call package. Or indeed a phone. But you will pay for line rental or the equivalent.

If you are with BT, they will automatically sign you up for their stupid package as well as line rental. If you don't use it to make the minimum calls you will be charged £4 every bill. (Oh how I wish I was making this up). Furthermore, if you have a phone plugged in, you may find BT have charged you for phantom calls.

Additionally, each step of the process (cancelling old line, installing new one, adsl/cable setup) will take approx 1-2 weeks and you will need to physically be in the property.

**My advice would be to simply run for the hills if BT is involved.**

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Hmm,  I just got back from a summer course on Plasma Physics and Fusion at the IPP in Munich.

As you might expect, I agree with you completely, and to be fair we are moving ahead on ITER (albeit very slowly).

The UK actually isn't _so_ bad in these areas - for example we have JET and MAST, imho we should build a Stellarator like Germany is as Stellarators lack many of the instabilities of the tokamak concept and now that we have modern plasma heating techniques (the tokamak was largely chosen because it could heat the plasma well via the plasma current) we don't need the plasma current and can use the stellarator approach.

That said - the situation can still be improved, as it is funded PhD places are pretty few and far between given the importance of the research and the stipends are painfully lower than what one can earn in industry (this is the same for all of science really). Of my graduating class most of the people with the top grades are looking for jobs in finance/actuarial work/programming etc. (indeed myself I am drawn to programming)

The problem isn't just that the PhD doesn't pay very much as you get a qualification after all, but it's the poor prospects after that due to the lack of academic positions and the opportunity cost of spending 3-4 years getting a PhD rather than having job experience if ultimately you will just end up working in industry anyway.

It's a shame because it means that many of the best people don't choose to go into science.

I'm thinking along the lines of a personal licence for alcohol, or the basic food safety cert here, where you have to demonstrate that you know all the risks before you can serve it.

If, on the other hand, this is the only demonstrable case, then it's a tragic accident, and I don't think that one can legislate away all risk - otherwise cars would be banned!  It's quite likely that, on the pack of this case, everyone else will tighten up their safety procedures, and that might well be suffcient to prevent a repeat.

I am reminded of the ~~fab~~ fad for cans of oxygen that went around in the late nineties - all very hip and trendy, and then someone did themselves an injury, and then the fab disappeared.

* Education is the future, if our economy is hurting now imagine what it would be like if we had even less qualified workers.
* Health. Fuck the tories, they aren't trying make the service more efficient, they're trying to get money to their pockets. The NHS needs to stay as it is, and increase funding in the short-term to hire people to figure out ways to decrease funding in the long term without effecting the quality of service. This is what the businesses interested in running the health care system privately would do, so why do we need to sell it to do that? So fucking dumb I have to resort to cussing.
* Telecommunications. Everywhere in the UK needs 50mb-100mb connections, just too many future services will depend on it. Be it watching high quality videos, downloading/playing games via steam or potentially the fact that things like Microsoft Office could eventually be a web based service (see office 365). At the moment you either live in/near a city or are completely disregarded. Right now I'm downloading at 300kbs, I cant even stream 720p without the occasional stutter, let alone have 2-3 rooms of the house watching their own hidef video. This isn't neccessarily a sustained cost either. With foresight this should be a one off investment that lasts a number of years.
* Power. The population is growing thus the demand for power is. We need more nuclear power plants. Thorium is extremely safe compared to uranium (and if i remember correctly has little to no waste), the problem right now is that thorium based power plants are not available, nobody has tried. How about the government does that creating jobs things and fund a university coalition to research and develop a thorium based reactor, create jobs for engineers and labourers to build them, and leave qualified work for people to run and maintain them? Instead of having a few windmills here and there that do little to cut the energy deficit?
* Transport. I won't argue that it needs cash but it's not a case of lack of money, it's a lack of the government sticking their foot up the arses of the businesses that run the transport system. Our spending is already equivalent to that of France and Germany, why isn't our service as good? Worst comes to worst, hire the French/Germans to run it.
* Housing. In my opinion this will fix itself. If there is any government influence that is stopping houses from being built, sure look in to it. However, the current house price problems are an issue of the economy, not a lack of a houses. People don't want to sell at a loss and people cant afford to buy at a premium, eventually one of these will change and it will likely be that the economy will stabilise and people will start buying again.",0,1349697797,null,0,1349698044,0,c6jbm1s,t3_113ncg,t1_c6jbm1s,t3_113ncg,null,1430093317,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

True. But on consoles you cannot flick it on and off so trivially and you'll almost definitely wind up sending for example your X-Box Live credentials to them.     

Also you assume that people won't forget it is on, or leave their e-mail client running, or similar layer 8 problems.    

&gt; Besides which, running a VPN does not guarantee you access to all US sites - a few block known VPN IPs     

It gives you greater access than Unblock US does. Plus if you run your own then that is a non-issue.

true,PuddleOfCrud,null,null,"&gt; The Communications Act 2003 section 127 covers the sending of improper messages. Section 127(1)(a) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and emails. Section 127(2) targets false messages and persistent misuse intended to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety; it includes somebody who persistently makes silent phone calls (usually covered with only one information because the gravamen is one of persistently telephoning rendering separate charges for each call unnecessary).

&gt; If a message sent is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing or false it is irrelevant whether it was received. The offence is one of sending, so it is committed when the sending takes place. The test for ""grossly offensive"" was stated by the House of Lords in DPP v Collins [2006] 1 WLR 2223 to be whether the message would cause gross offence to those to whom it relates (in that case ethnic minorities), who need not be the recipients. The case also said that it is justifiable under ECHR Article 10(2) to prosecute somebody who has used the public telecommunications system to leave racist messages.

&gt; A person guilty of an offence under section 127 CA 2003 shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine or to both. This offence is part of the fixed penalty scheme.

&gt; It is more appropriate to charge bomb hoaxes under section 51 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. See Public Order Offences, elsewhere in the Legal Guidance.

&gt; Section 127 can be used as an alternative offence to such crimes for example as hate crime (including race, religion, disability, homophobic, sexual orientation, and transphobic crime), hacking offences, cyber bullying, cyber stalking, amongst others.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I didn't see it on his Facebook wall and I doubt you did either... but we've both still seen it, he posted it in a public space and that has snowballed into the national press.

Why is it his fault that it snowballed? That's how the internet works. Regardless of privacy settings he loses all control over that information the instant it goes on Facebook. 

He did the responsible thing and posted it only on his wall. He didn't direct it to anyone with the intention of causing offence, he placed it somewhere only those who expressly agree to see his content could see it. 

The fact somebody else went and put it in a place that would cause offence is nothing to do with the originator of the content. 

&gt; anyone who can't see the hurt they can cause with such 'jokes' is as vile and heartless as they are.

**can**. 

That's the important word. Lots of things *can* cause offence but they don't because the person who says them is careful about the reach of their words but there is a limit to which you can control that message and beyond that limit you should be absolved of responsibility. 

Why is it his fault when something happens that he can't control, just because he was the originator?

Let's say this happened in a pub, in a group of friends. A group of friends he knows aren't going to be horribly offended by it and know he really means it as a  joke. Then let's say one of those friends (We'll call him Gary) decides to take his joke and tell it at work, in a group of people who really do find it offensive and report him to police for it. Is it still reasonable to arrest the original guy for this? He took all the precautions he could to not cause offense. It was Gary who was the dickhead who went and repeated it in a place where it was not appropriate and just because he was copying content rather than creating his own offensive content doesn't make it any less of **Gary's** fault.

&gt; Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, is to highlight official figures showing that only 283,080 households north of the border – 12 per cent of the total – pay more in tax than they receive in public services. 

It's unclear what numbers they're comparing here, and it's almost certainly not the amount of benefits paid out. I suspect what Ms Davidson has done is compared ""taxes spent per household"" to ""tax income per household"". This is equivalent to comparing the tax from each household to the average tax paid by a household - which is of course going to show much more than 50% of people pay less than the average amount of tax, because a) the UK's tax system is designed to be progressive; b) some rich people are very rich indeed, and some can easily contribute many-fold more tax than the poorest members of society (not to mention this figure apparently includes students, pensioners, etc); and c) much of the tax income derived from people's work is *not* paid directly by households (business taxes, duties, etc) and it's unclear if these figures were accounted for at all in the household figure.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; It has identical overhead.

Nope. Because it's a transparent proxy. Which means the stream you are accessing may already be cached in their server. If so, it will use the cached version, removing at least one major hop.

 Bizarrely you may get a faster service from unblock-US than a native netflix user experiences.

&gt;  But on consoles you cannot flick it on and off so trivially and you'll almost definitely wind up sending for example your X-Box Live credentials to them.

All traceroutes have consistently shown the same thing. Sites they support such as Hulu are redirected to the proxy, everything else - banking, xbox, whatever  go straight to the correct site, because the IP address their DNS service provides is the standard expected IP address for the site in question - the DNS behaves as normal.  Your xbox password is not being passed to them. It's libellous to make that claim.

It's no more risk than using your ISP, or OPENDNS, or GOOGLE  for DNS queries. 

Any thing going through the proxy generates certificate warnings as you would expect, so they aren't attempting any MITM attacks.

VPNs are awesome, but there is nothing wrong with unblock-us. It's based in Canada not some third world nation, it obeys the law, and it doesn't poison DNS queries other than an [ explicit list](http://support.unblock-us.com/customer/portal/articles/291570) of sites that is easily viewable.",0,1349702658,null,0,false,0,c6jc8h8,t3_113nmx,t1_c6jc8h8,t1_c6jbm8p,null,1430093607,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"&gt; Nope. Because it's a transparent proxy.     

I don't think you understand the meaning of the word ""transparent"" in that context. It has absolutely nothing to do with performance at all.     

&gt; Which means the stream you are accessing may already be cached in their server.     

It doesn't ""mean"" that. In fact no cache software I'm aware of (e.g. Squid) can cache a segment from a stream in the way you're suggesting. If it is a progressive download (i.e. not a stream) then it can be cached but most streams cannot.    

Flash video typically cannot be cached.    

&gt; All traceroutes have consistently shown the same thing. Sites they support such as Hulu are redirected to the proxy, everything else - banking, xbox, whatever go straight to the correct site     

That might very well be the case but there is nothing stopping them from changing it in the future. They could also change it for selective users or someone could break into their servers and redirect particular users.    

A better argument would be just to check the SSL certificates and to use Chrome since Chrome has known valid certificates cached locally.   

&gt; It's no more risk than using your ISP, or OPENDNS, or GOOGLE for DNS queries.    

You have to implicitly trust your ISP. You have no choice in that. Although if you didn't a VPN into a server you control (or a DNS server you control) would guarantee it.    

I disagree that it is ""no more risk"" than Google. It is more of a risk. Google are a massive company with a reputation to protect. Who is even behind Unblock US? Is what they do even legal? They're shady and their business is shady.    

It is like saying - so the dude selling me fake ID is ""no more risk"" of stealing my wallet than the train conductor...    

&gt; there is nothing wrong with unblock-us.    

I didn't say there was. I listed pros and cons.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"This seems a win/win for companies.    

They will force employees to take the new shares instead of real income and in-exchange the employee get nothing, except that one day the shares might be worth some money (or entirely worthless). The employers on top of a pay reduction also get to reduce those annoying employee rights that always get in the way of profit (damn those silly laws!).     

If I was a large company (Company A) I would spawn off another company (Company B), and then move my employees under that umbrella. I would then have Company B take out a loan from Company A so that Company B was in debt, I would then pay employees very little and trick them into taking out ""shares"" in Company B (their employer) instead.    

I would eventually collapse Company B and with outstanding debt owed to Company A the employees would get nothing. So Company A gets all of the profits, with a lower employee bill since they're taking lower pay and also aren't costing you money with their silly employment laws (like unfair dismissal).   

PS - The above example where shell companies are used with fake ""loans"" is a very real thing that companies often do. A lot of people have been tricked when a profitable company transferred a lot of assets to a shell company and then the original company collapses with nothing but debt.

Read up on adaptive bit rate videos. Modern adaptive video streaming uses progressive downloads to send a tiny chunk of video to you, and progressive downloads can be cached.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; I have to admit though, 12% figure is too stark, even for direct taxes. 

I wondered about this, so I went to check. If we assume that that tax is proportional to income, and the mean income represents the mean tax burden, we can do some quick numbers. Stats are taken from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom), so, pinch of salt and all that. From it, though, we can get that the mean household income is about £38,500:

&gt; (In 2011) the after-tax earnings of the median household was around £26,000 per annum[9] while average net household income (after tax) stood at £38,547.00.[10]

So, we need to work out how many households earn more than this, to count the ""net contributors"".

The wiki article also has a table for income ranges by household. It's from 2005, but good enough for a benchmark. It lists a total of just over 30 million households. 1.68 million earned above the 30-50k band, so are definitely above average and net contributors. Lets say 50% of the 30 to 50k band also earn over £38,500. That's a further 2.05 million households. So, in the UK, 3.73 million households earn more than the average income, and would be counted as ""net contributors"" under this analysis. out of a population of 30.03 million households, that comes out at.... 12.3%. 

Admittedly that's a very rough-and-ready analysis, and doesn't take into account all the complexities of the tax system. But I think it's sufficient to highlight that the vast majority of people in this country earn less than the mean income, and that the 12% figure is probably pretty representative of the UK as a whole, not just Scotland.",0,1349706627,null,0,false,0,c6jcyz3,t3_114v4i,t1_c6jcyz3,t1_c6jcdd8,null,1430093961,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Lots of people would argue that figure also, as it break ups up some things along percentage of total UK population as opposed to location and region. And includes things like Trident.

I suspect the figure quoted by Ruth Davidson includes *all* public services and not just benefits - it's purposely worded to be ambiguous. So it includes things like the cost of Policing, Education, etc. It would have helped if she quoted figures for other regions of the UK and the country as a whole. In addition she discounts some sources of income, it would be like working out the contribution of London and not including the financial sector.

""Ok if the replay shows i was wrong, then i will amend my decision in the report; but from where i was positioned / what my official told me, i made the decision i thought was correct"".

How long until we get sick of this.  We all know officials get things wrong, what frustrates us is when they consistently get things wrong with regard to the same player (Suarez) or just repeatedly not getting what you feel you deserve, a succession of penalty appeals not awarded etc.

Interviewing the referee isn't going to change that, i agree they should be held more accountable, they should be scrutinized and made to explain decisions, there should be replays there using the technology they use in the studio's to show his viewpoint, but doing this to the general public I think is not going to work, people are angry and don't think objectively when they're upset about a decision, it's just going to make them rage.

It's pretty obvious the referee made / makes the decision he thinks is correct at the time, having him say that doesn't help the situation.

edit:  The simple solution is to have a video referee, they do it in rugby league, the game is stopped anyway in most situations whereby you would want to use the video ref, and we the viewers at home usually see a reply during that time anyway, is it that big of a deal to have an official watch that reply and say yes thats a penalty, no thats not a penalty?",0,1349710118,null,0,1349710851,0,c6jds1k,t3_114sh5,t1_c6jds1k,t1_c6jbca6,null,1430094335,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Actually, ""The End of the World"" and ""The Unquiet Dead"" didn't do it for me either, but eventually you'll want to watch them, or read a synopsis so you understand plot points.

From season 1, start with ""Aliens of London"".  You can go back and watch the first 3 episodes later.  Aliens of London is a 2-part episode with ""World War 3"", and it's a bit campy, but it's still a good episode.  ""Dalek"" is next, and one of my favorite episodes from that season.

""The Long Game"" isn't a favorite, but it sets up an important plot point for the season finale.  ""Father's Day"" is good, but a lot of people like it more than I do.

""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" is, no doubt, my favorite story of the first season, and one of my favorites of the entire series.

""Boom Town"" isn't that great either, but it wraps up a plot started earlier in the season.

Even with the help of the PR vote in the Scottish Parliament elections  they only have 15 SMPs (out of 129 seats).

true,easytiger,cnty-ni,London,"This is not taxing an increase in property value... that would be fairly impossible to do. If it where what would it be? An annual tax on the delta of purchase price Vs current accessed price? If that's the case why does the government exempt capital gains if you sell a dwelling which is your main home? That is the closest they could get to actually taxing that delta.

Don't forget all taxes are arbitrary anyway. The only reason we sustain them is, bluntly, because the government will take away your personal freedom if you don't pay up, being as they are armed and staffed with enforcers.

This argument is as old as the hills. King William III introduced a window tax in the 17th Century in order to levy a tax roughly proportional to the value of people's property, not unlike this one. That is where we get the phrase Daylight Robbery, apparently. The French had this till the 1920s.  King Henry VIII and Liz I introduced/reintroduced a tax on beards. There was a tax on wallpaper which existed between 1712 and 1836 (and faking the wallpaper stamp was punishable by death). Pitt the Younger introduced a hat tax because the wealthy were fond of having many hats. We had a long standing candle tax and as part of the enforcement it was made illegal to even make your own for your own use without declaring it. A tax on soap outlawed anything but industrial levels of soap production. Income tax was invented to fund the campaign against Napoleon. Even the very bricks were subject to a specific tax. Modern organisational and communication infrastructure allowed us to levy a consumption tax we call VAT. This allowed a natural layering mechanism to tax large arrays of products and services efficiently.

In short, yes taxes give us good things if we have an administration who is using the money wisely. But be under no illusion, all taxation is a heist. We willing participate because as part of our altruistic understanding of a greater social good that can be enabled by their judicious use.

We are dangerously approaching an *effective taxation level* in this country that is approaching a critical level which will render average individuals unable to save for their future or to make an effective economic contribution with the money they are now giving to the government.

The real reason the car was the ""chosen one"" was because it just couldn't be brought to a stand still by any strike.

What got me was there was a special on BBCA i wanted to see and some how during the show the remote went missing. Eventually I gave up looking and did chores/cleaning/intensive remote searching and an eppisode of the 11th (current) doctor came on and caught my interest.

It had a better story and good effects. It got me curious and I started watching. I find I liked a lot of the stories and the better effects. There are still the occasional weird story and campy effects but it's tolerable given the context of the show. If I were to label it, it'd be an action/sci-fi/fantasy/comedy/drama

Since then I've been able to go slowly back and watch the 10th doctors episodes and I'm still going through them. They are a bit more quirky and the effects a tad cheesier at times but I still find myself enjoying it.

You made some wild claims about them gaining access to your xbox password (oh noes!) which I corrected because it was FUD, based on imaginary what ifs. They have the power to poison DNS, but with one click that power is turned on or off.   

People with Xbox gold are not going to fuck around with their network settings just to watch netflix, they'll use a PC to do that. Ping rates are more important to gold gamers than watching movies on a media centre than sounds like an aeroplane.

So for most people their games console will never go through their servers, because it will still use their ISP DNS.

But even if they did route their games console through their DNS server, it still wouldn't mean the password would go through their servers. To do that would require them to deliberately poison DNS for sites not on their list, which would be a crime.

&gt; I am trying to give people factual information about the upsides and downsides of three different options

Except it's not very factual. The VPN you recommended ends up being called shady as you dig yourself into a libel hole. You make claims about games consoles that are scare mongering and so on.

I should moderate this by pointing out I dislike both Conservatives, Lib Dems and Labour with equal measure. 

But it seems very common practice for every *current* government to go to great lengths to point out how all of their changes are only in the interests of fixing the mess the *last* government left behind. 

But here we're looking at what is being said now - their solution to national debts seems to be to focus on the ""have-nots"", rather than the ""haves"". There's no talk of finding £10bn from the top 10% of earners in the country after all, is there?

For whatever the reasons, whatever the mess left behind, whatever outside influences on national and international scale - that's what they're looking at doing and that's what we must evaluate.

Britain already has exceptionally high taxes, especially compared to America but also to many other successful economies. We also have comparably high house prices and a high cost of land. If someone has a large house or any land, there is practically no chance of being able to fix it up or change it because of council regulations. You may think otherwise, but compared to other countries, Britain isn't too favorable to the rich. 

Now many rich people own companies. They have large amounts of capital to invest, and also experience with businesses, developments in technology, science and design. They understand domestic and global markets. Whether you like it or not, they make this country run. Unless you are self employed, your job is very likely to have been made by a rich person deciding to invest in the British workforce. They make investments in stock markets which, despite misguided opinions in the media, do work to our benefit most of the time. They loan to small businesses who need it to grow. They create the opportunity for us to export our ideas and products and reap the benefits in lands that most people in Britain wouldn't be able to spell, let alone point to on a map. 

Now you might think some of them are smarmy aristocratic cunts who don't deserve their fortune. You may well be right. But that number makes up a very small amount of the people who would be affected by the ""mansion"" tax. The absolute worst idea in a bad British economy is to start taking more money from rich people. We already take half their money before they've even got it. 

All you will achieve in doing is driving away the people who provide the vast majority of jobs, investment and money in Britain as they can and indeed will go and live in America or Australia or Germany, have a larger salary, get taxed less of it, and be able to enjoy the fruits of their labour more. 

Unfortunately, people seem to forget we are in a shit economy. Whoever is in power will have to make decisions which look bad whatever he chooses. The media isn't going to report anything Cameron, Clegg or even Ed Milliband if he was in power as ""well it was the best decision he could have made because otherwise we would be in worse shit"". They will pounce on anything and everything he does because it sells newspapers. Cameron has the unfortunate position of residing over a crisis he had no part in creating. People are very easy to forget the Iraq war started under Labour which we are still paying for, or the gold we sold for next to nothing under Labour, etc etc. 

I'm not rich, and I'm not on benefits either, but I hate it when people get riled up about things which are just bollocks. Yes, it isn't a good thing that we have to cut benefits, though the system is widely abused and needs sharpening. But when times are tough, we have to be calm and prudent towards our solution rather than loud and ignorant.

The owners own 750 of those shares and the employees are granted 250.    

The owners can increase the pool size from 1000 (total) to 2000 (total). They can then buy the free 1000 shares (at the company's current value) which essentially decreases the employee's stake from 25% to 12.5%, or effectively halving their stake.    

In theory share holders should be notified about this re-issue and offered the chance to buy the additional shares but that often doesn't happen or the employees couldn't afford to do so.    

So if we jump forward and suddenly the company is sold for 10 million, instead of the employees getting 2.5m, they get 1.25m.

true,Mepsi,null,null,"Well the cerebral palsy joke conviction actually makes sense under the law, I wasn't aware it was a disability joke: 

&gt; If a message sent is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing or false it is irrelevant whether it was received. The offence is one of sending, so it is committed when the sending takes place. The test for ""grossly offensive"" was stated by the House of Lords in DPP v Collins [2006] 1 WLR 2223 to be whether the message would cause gross offence to those to whom it relates (in that case ethnic minorities), who need not be the recipients. The case also said that it is justifiable under ECHR Article 10(2) to prosecute somebody who has used the public telecommunications system to leave racist messages.

&gt; A person guilty of an offence under section 127 CA 2003 shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine or to both. This offence is part of the fixed penalty scheme.

&gt; Section 127 can be used as an alternative offence to such crimes for example as hate crime (including race, religion, disability, homophobic, sexual orientation, and transphobic crime), hacking offences, cyber bullying, cyber stalking, amongst others. 

Just like an ethnic minority, people with cerebral palsy are being falsely labled as ""not working properly"" which can cause great offense regardless of who receives it.

For the level of public services that we as a country want (universal healthcare, free education to age 18, universal pensions at age 67, 2.5% GDP spent on defence, etc.) is currently costing more than we are raising in taxes, by about £121bn every year. We need to cut spending and raise taxes to solve this. They are looking for an extra £10bn for 2015-16, and the question is how to balance this between cutting welfare and increasing taxes.

In my opinion, the coalition's deficit reduction policy is pretty much pushing the limit of possible spending cuts to welfare, to the point where it will stop being an effective safety net for the disabled and unemployed if they go much further. I think they could find the money in the ""non-safety net"" part of the welfare budget (child benefit, free TV licenses/bus passes etc.) but I don't think they have the balls to do something so politically unpopular.

So if we can get a few extra billion in tax rises, we can reduce those benefit cuts down to say £6-7bn. If you accept the argument this far, the question boils down to how can we take money from people in efficient way that isn't easy to evade?

Raising income tax or NICs just tends to encourage avoidance, and also disincentivises work and taking on new employees. VAT is about as high as we can really push it, and raising it further would be hugely regressive and unpopular.

Taxing property is an obvious choice because a) owning a £2m+ mansion is highly correlated with ability to pay, b) you can't move your mansion offshore to avoid tax, c) it's not a tax on jobs or work, so is less harmful to the economy and avoids disincentivising working hard and d) it can be implemented through the existing council tax system so will be relatively easy and cheap to administer.",0,1349725488,null,0,false,0,c6jhwuc,t3_114s4t,t1_c6jhwuc,t1_c6jh0gi,null,1430096349,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

They're actually the [RU Atheist, Humanist &amp; Secularist society.](http://www.rusu.co.uk/societies/RAHS/) Sorry if that comes off as nitpicking, but like I say I don't know of any exclusively atheist groups or groups that exist with 'atheism' being the sole reason. There's a very strong argument to be made from the secular point of view with regards to the pineapple.

But I've been interested in seeing the reaction to that story. It's easy to conclude, on first impressions, that the group were just being dicks and it's fair enough if people want to call them that. Yet they were told to leave for the simple reason of labelling a pineapple Mohammed. Of course we know *why* that's a problem, but not enough people are focussing on whether or not it should be. It seems that many people have decided that that particular sort of jest should have a free pass. I find that incident interesting as, given the huge number of human rights abuses that go on in some countries using Islam (and other religions of course) as an excuse, would anyone think a non-religious (or anti religious) group was justified in complaining about a religious organisation setting up a stall at an SU fair?

Back on top though, I'm fairly confident the vast majority of UK Muslims wouldn't complain even if they did think the atheists are tossers.

Sorry, I've got all discuss-y and I'm not sure you're interested in the subject. I'm gathering my thoughts on this at the moment, and have a propensity to type out loud.

edit - Sorry I've just realised that in this particular instance the example I give (of issues overseas) can't be directly related to the pineapple incident as human rights abuses aren't taking place in a hall at an SU and not by the people in that particular society. But then again my old SU banned Nestle for things they were doing overseas... and groups like the BNP don't often get a voice.

true,doeboy73,null,null,"Disclaimer: I'm not in a position to know what's happening behind the scenes. The following is based on rumor, hyperbole and years of inexperience.


The 2 biggest factors affecting QPR at the moment are *The 2 I's*....


**1. Instability**

Many managers, owners and huge volumes of players have passed through QPR in the past few years. This makes a poor basis for any football team, no matter what their level of skill and experience.

For several reasons Hughes does not know his best eleven; one reason is that the best eleven probably haven't appeared on the pitch together yet.


**2. Injuries**

I think at one point recently we had 10 players injured. Again, that is a recipe for disaster at any club. Our fortunes will not begin to change until this damage is repaired.


**Hughes**

Let me state the obvious: Hughes has changed too much too soon. I think he's been dogmatic about ripping out old players who were reliable enough to get a few goals in each season and could be trusted upon to scrape a successful, if unattractive, defensive performance when backs are against walls.

All of the football world knew QPR had a poor defense in need of strengthening and depth. Hughes left it until the dying days of the transfer window, after being f**ked by Swansea,  to acquire some defenders (aside from Nelsen &amp; Fabio).

I see a football snobbery to Hughes' player selection, a desire to play top-level football before the team can even walk, using highly paid players from top-flight teams and old friends, rather than taking reliable talent, perhaps even from lower leagues. It shows a real lack of pragmatism that the likes of Warnock survive and thrive on each season.


**The Facebook crazies**

I am of the opinion they are casual supporters who don't often go to games and seldom watch a game on TV. Amongst other things they call for players who aren't even in the named 25 to start games(?). It's easy to type trash on a social media site - as many football players know - I just leave it at that. 
When I go to a game the supporters I speak to seem sane and level-headed. I've only once heard an older long-term supporter call for a manager to go (that was when an old workmate called into TalkSport after our 1-1 draw to MK Dons).


**Park**

He's obviously not captain material. He doesn't speak. Speaking is a basic requirement of a captain. Having said that, neither Warnock nor Hughes seem to give two hoots about the captains' armband, yet it usually seems to protect the wearer from being subbed - it wasn't until Barton was so bad, he became just too embarrassing, that he was taken off. At least Hughes has so far subbed Park once.


**Derry**

Won't score goals but is a captain of defense. We all know he was the practical captain during our promotion year. There are Facebook crazies who seriously believe Taarabt marshaled the team to success. I call that view retarded as I have no other explanation for it.
Derry has a very level head, very vocal and has a footballing brain. I suspect it is only Hughes' dogma that keeps Derry out of the line-up.

**Barton**

I don't care about his tweets, his personality or the music he listens to. I care that Barton was mostly sxxt last season. He single-handedly lost us at least 2 games by being pure sxxt. All our current midfielders are better than him. If he did anything slightly good in a game, many people watching TV would sing his praises. There's no reason on this earth to take him back into the fold during the January transfer window. I'm glad Beard has said there's no way back for him.",0,1349727052,null,0,1349734448,0,c6jicl7,t3_114yrk,t1_c6jicl7,t3_114yrk,null,1430096565,3,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,3

true,naich,cnty-uk,Cambridge,"&gt; If you buy a 100k house and prices go up 10%, you do indeed have an 'extra' 10k. It also means that the 200k house you intended to move to is now 220k - so you're actually worse off

Except you've got an extra 10K deposit, which means you might get a better rate, pay less for your mortgage and can thus borrow more.  The point was that you buy a house in an area where the prices are rising faster than other places.  House prices do not rise by the same amount in every location.  You are also adding value to your house by improving it.

As for the second point, you've chopped out the bit where I said that you should make sure you won't default.  And a 0.5% increase will increase the mortgage payments (25 year mortgage on 150,000 at 2%) from 635.78 to 672.93, a whopping 37 quid, and hardly 25%.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"a) I do understand progressive taxation, ""half their money"" is hyperbole in a rant, not a referenced point in an essay.

b) Lets use your wikipedia page and find these ""other successful economies"" which tax individuals less than us. Well on personal income tax, lower economies are indeed Russia, Canada and the US. 

There are others, by we can factor them out by their high cost of living. There are reasons for UK citizens to go to Australia, Germany as well as others but lets focus on the US and Canada. 

Both have a lower income tax, and have a [lower cost of living](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp), so are favourable. Canada has a very similar average wage to the UK, the US has around $7000 higher on average. Therefore in real terms, the income tax rate for both countries is  significantly lower than the percentages given.

Ergo, there is a reason from taxation to go to the US or Canada, particularly if we were to raise ours without either of them doing the same.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"A Tory with a conscience is called a Lib Dem.

Most people over 35 can remember Scotland being the ""testing ground"" for the tories in the 80s.  

So who the fuck, in their right mind grew up in the 80's, watching what happened in the North and Scotland and thought ""when I grow up I want to be a tory""?

Everyone in the south who thought ""you know what, I'm a bit right of centre, but I don't want to be a cunt about it"", became a lib dem.

Equally everyone in the north who thought ""you know what, Nu Labour are cunts"" became a lib dem.

So OP is correct the only people in the tory party, are people with no social conscience.

And you know what - when a tory gets up and claims 9 out of 10 scots live off the state, because clearly the 47% bullshit Romney spouted worked so well for his campaign, while calmly ignoring the huge oil and gas wealth in Scottish waters that is ""shared"" with the UK and not providing data on VAT and alcohol taxes, nor the savings to the NHS and pensions because Scots die younger than southerners, then yes, I think the OP is fully entitled to call them a cunt.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"While I am not arguing that there are benefit cheats, and people who game the system, I'm not sure it's fair to blame them entirely for their situation.

Firstly, there's an issue of motivation - if you could get money for doing very little, it seems - from a dispassionate point of view - perfectly stupid that you would not choose this option. Those of us with ambition, social loyalty, and a desire to further ourselves would disagree - but we are the peculiar ones who have allegiances to such bizarre concepts to such an extent that we willingly make our lives *more difficult* for a greater reward that is in no way guaranteed. If we acted that way at a casino, we would be profitable for the casino, yet still poor and stupid.

Secondly, there's the issue of education. These bizarre loyalties that we have are instilled in us by our parents and our education systems. A lot of the people about which you complain see no value in education because it sees, or has seen, no value in them. In an age of metrics and exam results, the lowest-performing are marginalised and discouraged by schools. Educating all people to a sufficient standard is difficult given the limited time and resources of our education system, and the regimented nature of the all-powerful National Curriculum. Some schools were so poor that they offered no schooling or education whatsoever; during the 80s, my parents moved to a rural-ish area of Kent where there was only one primary school, which had no teachers, no classes and no lessons - they had no money to pay teachers and had to rely entirely on non-teaching (or poorly-teaching) volunteers. If my parents had not had the money to pay for a primary school education and further tutoring, my life would have been a whole lot different - I would have been behind for my whole life. Only 30 years ago, our education system was failing, and it took a lot of people down with it - people who are now passing on that mistrust to their own children. A single mistake made by the Conservatives for one generation can take 4 generations or more to fix. That is just how society works. 

Thirdly, looking at someone else's situation and comparing it against your own is considered immature; it is not the way an adult is expected to act. Unless you are in complete possession of all the facts about their lives, any comparison will be shallow, meaningless and lacking any nuance or understanding. Furthermore, the way to become a happier person - as I have been taught - is to avoid making comparisons with others around you and to focus on improving ones own situation. Judge who you are today by who you were ~~tomorrow~~ yesterday (Edit: ahem, I clearly have time-travelling issues), and you will remain on a steady path, untroubled by jealousy or anger.

Fourthly, I would point out that unemployment is not necessarily a bad thing. If it were not for the fact that we still have money, and that said money has to pass through all our hands, much of what we do today could be automated, and a fraction of the manpower required for the financial industry would be required for different forms of resource allocation. Do you remember the various magazine articles published 30 or 40 years ago about 'The World Of Tomorrow' - where people had a lot of free time and robots did all the work for us? If we don't get over the attitude of meaningless work being somehow worthwhile, that future will hit us hard - and we won't be lounging around with ample spare time, writing sonnets or researching the secrets of the universe, we'll be scurrying around rubbish dumps looking for food. Make no mistake - full business automation is coming (I have been contracted by several companies in the past to write software that, essentially, puts swathes of middle management out on the street) and we will have to adapt to that. With more and more out of work, there will be fewer and fewer consumers - it's obvious and yet many companies continue with automation oblivious to the role employment plays in our economy. As such, we are going to see a need for a vastly increased benefit state, rather than a smaller one - it is possible, almost probable, that the benefit state will be the primary driver of our economy after the automation tipping point. Needless to say, those who you have issues with will be the ones who have no problems adapting to the new reality. I would imagine that such benefits would be paid for by granting sufficiently 'intelligent' automated systems a kind of limited citizenship (or slavery contract, if you will) whereby they are considered 'employees' and their wages are paid to the state for the benefit of all - a sort of 'no human worker tax.' This may sound far-fetched, but it is already happening and, by current estimates, business automation is outstripping job creation (jobs automated vs. jobs created) so we may very well be all in the same boat as those who game the benefit system before too long. Can a computer do your job now? What about in 2 years, given the current rate of technological improvement? Ultimately, work for a wage and for self-esteem is becoming obsolete, you could say that benefit cheats are just ahead of the curve.",0,1349733636,null,0,1349736469,0,c6jk7kr,t3_114s4t,t1_c6jk7kr,t1_c6jg3e9,null,1430097434,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,naich,cnty-uk,Cambridge,"&gt; It's just a bit galling that, given the cyclical nature of the market you're telling us (just off peak) that all we have to do is what you did, when you started in a trough. Anyone buying a house today outside of central London is buying into a depreciating asset.

This advice is for someone trying to buy a house in a rapidly rising area.  I can't offer advice based on personal experience for other situations.  If prices are falling, the only thing I can advise is to hold off buying a house and invest your deposit money until they bottom out and start rising again.  The following advice is for someone wanting to get into a rising market.

In the present climate, it's likely that interest rates will remain low for the next few years so now is a good time to get a mortgage.  The ""living off beans on toast"" is obviously hyperbole but if the aim is to own a house then you will need to be frugal and sacrifice many luxuries that a young single person might have got used to.  If the rates go up you will need to find other ways to cut your living costs -  cycling, rather than using a car to get to work, going on holiday in a tent, stop buying ready meals and do the cooking yourself.  Make sarnies for lunch rather than eating in the canteen.  These are all things we've done in tough times and it all adds up to real savings.  Also, these days most banks *won't* lend you colossal multiples of your salary so unless you lie to them you should be OK.  Ultimately, it's a gamble, but that's the nature of the game.

&gt; what happens if/when you need to move back to an area where prices are rising faster?

Some houses and areas will always be outside your reach and will never return.  Accept that.  But there are bands of houses in areas which have the same sort of prices and attributes.  If you can get a house in a band which is on the edge of an expanding bubble then you can ride the bubble as it moves outwards, moving to larger houses in the same area but maybe a couple of streets further out.  Literally, two streets further away from the bubble's centre can mean a price difference of 20-30K, or to put it another way, an extra bedroom.

If you start off in the highest band you can, with the shittiest house you can get away with, larger and better houses within that band will become available to you in time as your finances improve (generally, your wages will be going up), your deposit increases and you can borrow more money at lower rates.  The trick is to see which areas the bubble is moving out in and pick a shit house in a good area.  We had to rip out the kitchen in two of our houses (back to bare brick in one), staying round a mates the first time and turning the bathroom into a makeshift kitchen the second time - that was fun with a 2 year old.  But selling your lovely house and buying a shit house with an extra bedroom for the same amount, gets you a nice house with an extra bedroom once you've done it up.

The point is that once you are ON the ladder, you are being taken up with the price rises - maybe not at the same rate as the most desirable properties, but at least you aren't being left behind.  

I know we got lucky initially, getting the right sort of house at the right time, but we've been very calculating about our movements since then and it has paid off.  We have managed to find a bubble and ride it outwards.",0,1349734383,null,0,1349734564,0,c6jkeny,t3_1139rh,t1_c6jkeny,t1_c6jjk92,null,1430097533,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

For example, he was critical of the UK's half-hearted welfarism and statism, where a piecemeal settlement had occured, where people want things to be one way but not necessarily pay for it, meaning that the state could not provide a quality of service but instead enough of a service, and employ enough people, that it provides succour without stimulation or quality of life. In other words, we came out poorly against social democratic countries with better commited state services, or in Germany's case local services (as Germany, naturally, is more suspicious of statism rather than regionalism).

At the same time he criticised the country's fear of following a more liberal agenda, meaning that the UK economy lacked efficiency and the productive means to grow besides credit bubbles, as although we had jettisoned loss-making industries, we still pursued a semi-statist approaches and lacked the side-benefits of a non-state orientated system- in other words a more highly developed charitable sector, more societal and corporate support and funding etc that is seen in some other countries such as the USA, Japan and South Korea. The UK also thus lacked the means by which the poor could move up and fulfill the potential of liberal systems to redistribute opportunity and wealth through labour-market and educational dynamism.

In other words, in his comparison of Anglo Saxon, Rhenish and East-Asian models of capitalism, he felt the UK needed to shit or get off the pot.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I think the bigger problem is the way the public and the law are totally failing to make a distinction between messages that are addressed to the public and messages that are addressed to individuals. It should be illegal to abuse individuals, but I don't think it is actually possible to be abusive towards the general public.  
[This is the logic I've been using:](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/10i0th/uk_prosecutors_finally_acknowledge_the_need_for_a/)
&gt;*(Disclaimer - I don't actually use twitter or know much about how it works so I might be mistaken on some things. I'm just putting my opinion out there to get the discussion going.)*

&gt;As far as I can tell one of the problems is Twitter's tagging process falls somewhere between public statements and directed messages.

&gt;If I was under the impression that ""OP is a fag"" then I could leave a comment somewhere on reddit saying ""EquanimousMind is a fag"", and I'm pretty sure free speech would mean I'm not breaking any rules. If I sent EquanimousMind a PM saying ""You're a fag"" then that could be seen as needlessly offensive/abusive, and if I overdid it I might be prosecuted for harrassment and bullying.  
AFAIK most of these ""twitter arrests"" occur when someone tweets using the ""@"" symbol, which sends the tweet as a message to the tagged person. So I could say ""You are a fag @EquanimousMind"" and EquanimousMind would recieve that message, and everybody on twitter would be able to see it.

&gt;In my opinion, that is where the line should be. Just because twitter (and youtube and facebook etc.) makes it cheap and easy to send direct messages doesn't change the fact that it is still a direct message. Just because the message is available to read by the general public doesn't change the fact that it's a direct message. I think it's fine for a comedian to go on TV and say ""Tony Blair is a tosser!"" as a joke, I think it is quite different for a comedian to go on TV and say ""Look at this letter I sent to Tony Blair calling him a tosser!"" though.

true,Mepsi,null,null,"Sorry about a dump of text but I think it's important to understand where the law comes from:

&gt; The test for ""grossly offensive"" was stated by the House of Lords in DPP v Collins [2006] 1 WLR 2223 to be whether the message would cause gross offence to those to whom it relates (in that case ethnic minorities), who need not be the recipients. 

Here are details of that case: 

&gt; C telephoned his MP’s constituency office on a number of occasions over a period of more than two years. He would speak to whoever answered the phone, or would leave a message on the answering machine if no one answered. Three people who worked in the office spoke to him or heard his messages. In these conversations and messages, he would often speak of his dislike for “wogs”, “Pakis” and “black bastards”. None of those who heard him were a member of an ethnic minority. One found his language upsetting. C was charged with sending, by means of a public communication system, messages that were grossly offensive or of an obscene character, an offence under s.127(1) Communications Act 2003. Magistrates acquitted C on the basis that a reasonable person would consider his messages offensive, but not grossly so. The Administrative Court upheld the acquittal. The DPP appealed. 

Continued: 

&gt; Allowing the appeal:

&gt; S.127(1) was intended to prohibit the use of a public service to transmit communications which contravened basic standards of society. The actus reus was the sending of a message, regardless of whether it was received. It did not matter whether or not the person receiving the message was offended. It was a question of fact in all the circumstances whether a message was grossly offensive, applying the standards of an open and just multi-racial society. The test was whether a message was liable to cause gross offence to those to whom it related. The mens rea was that the defendant must have intended the words to be grossly offensive or be aware that they might be taken to be so. This would ordinarily be found where a message was couched in terms indicating an intention to insult, or where facts known to the sender made the message offensive to the recipient.

&gt; C's messages were grossly offensive and C should have been convicted. 

&gt; Their Lordships clairified that the purpose of this provision, making it clear that an offence will be committed whenever a public communications service is used to send a message which the sender intends is, or knows might be taken to be, grossly offensive. Their Lordships held that Article 10 was complied with by the mens rea requirement.

&gt; C's case turned on whether his messages were 'grossly offensive' to a reasonable person. Their Lordships reluctantly disagreed with the Magistrates, Lord Carswell attributing this to the Magistrates having been influenced by the attitudes of those who heard the message, which was a factor their Lordships held to be irrelevant.

* Take a jelly or cream [log roll](http://www.littledebbie.com/products/StrawberryShortcake.asp) for your base
* Use [white icing](http://www.bettycrocker.co.uk/product_detail.aspx?range=5) to glue on a [resses peanut butter cup](http://extreme-couponing-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/extreme-couponing-tips-reese.jpeg)
* Use some [chocolate icing](http://www.bettycrocker.co.uk/product_detail.aspx?range=5) to glue on a cream puff cookie/ [Whippit Cookie](http://www.taquitos.net/im/sn/Whippet.jpg)
* Use [Runts](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3321188211_91152f1fc5.jpg) and push into the log roll for the rivets
* For the arms use [After eight sticks](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_LusykVkAUBs/TBFG4nciBWI/AAAAAAAAAHM/b02kbJ-JN1s/s1600/Nestle+After+Eight+90g+Straws.jpg) and break in half
* For the head/eye thing use a [candy cigarette](http://wharble.com/sites/default/files/Popeye_Candy_Cigarettes.jpg) and glue(with icing) on a Runt for the eye
* I would add an [oreo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Oreo.jpg) in between the cream puff and peanut butter cup to get more of a vent effect
* Then add [gum drops](http://chicohomesearch.net/files/2007/12/blog-pics-gum-drops-resized.jpg) for the ears on top of the cream puff
* Also you might want to start with a [Wagon wheel](http://www.darefoods.com/Img/Flavours/WagonWheels_Fudge.jpg) for the base ""skirt"" mentioned earlier.
* Finally both arms arnt the same on a dalek so maybe use a [candy corn](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Candy-Corn.jpg/250px-Candy-Corn.jpg) for the shorter arm

&gt; Using prevailing corporation tax rates at the time, this translated to savings worth £961m to Vodafone, either in reduced taxes, or by generating tax credits to offset future profits.

Though I'm sure its not easy to determine exactly where the line is, I dont think its hard to roughly see where it is. Non-sustained, non-threatening, offending words are a societal problem, not a criminal problem.

I think we need more focus on a core, precise, constitution and lots of reasonable, common sense judges. And a lot less legislation. The [law has become too sprawling in the past and has had be be consolidated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law_consolidation_Acts_1861).

His death was never the fixed point, it was always the destruction of the Tesselecta. All the reports of his death, as Mark Twain would have said, were greatly exaggerated. Everyone *thought* The Doctor died at Lake Silencio, and The Doctor knew he would have to adhere to this. However, at some point during The Wedding of River Song, he realized that it wasn't in fact his death. And, who knows, perhaps the reason why he invited Amy, River, and Rory was to ensure his own fixed version of his death. Since River witnessed herself killing the Tesselecta, it insured his fake death as a fixed point.

My running theory is that he realized that he wasn't supposed to die with the more he found out about The Silence. Since they couldn't know about the Fields of Trenzalore if his death was a fixed point(Which would mean the Fields of Trenzalore would never happen).

its REALLY unfair to compare a low budget scifi tv show to our modern megabudget blockbuster scifi movies. they just dont have the resources. that said I am on season 5 right now and still loving it despite the fact that every time i hear a dalek go ""EXTERMINATE"" i cant help but uncomfortably laugh and hope maybe the daleks will go away(though 5 seasons in they are almost endearing to me now because they are portrayed as this monster to-be-feared race and they usually dont actually DO anything but make awkward remarks).

Secondly, and this is the main reason, it fits with Wilfred being the Doctor's companion.  Donna had previously been the Doctor's companion until he ""lost"" her, and her grandfather Wilfred is serving as a temporary companion in her place.  Similarly, the Doctor had lost his granddaughter Susan to the time war.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Are British people really as reserved as some people say they are?

Some and some.  We tend to be more reserved than North Americans and Southern Europeans, but we're certainly not usually the cold, unemotional, repressed and aloof people we often get stereotyped as.  We just take a bit longer to warm up to strangers.  There's also a difference between people in London, who, a bit like New Yorkers, tend to be busy and self-absorbed on a day to day basis, and people who come from the north/Scotland or more rural parts of the country.  Having said that, Londoners are as friendly as anyone if you take the time to get to know them in a business or social context.

&gt;What are some cool places that foreigners have not heard of?

Depends what your definition of cool is.  Nightlife-wise, some of our northern cities have pretty good scenes for towns of their size, as does Brighton on the South Coast.  Belfast, in Northern Ireland, is a surprise on that front too (or at least, it was to me).  I'm not sure any of these are really ""secrets"" though, and you might have something else in mind?

&gt;What is the best part of being British?

Hard to come up with a single one, but I'd plump for taking ourselves less seriously than most nationalities.  There are plenty of jingoistic idiots in Britain, of course, but in general terms we see the irony of our position in the modern world and it makes most of us smile rather than cry, or go red faced and shout a lot.

&gt;Is the weather really gray most of the time?

'Fraid so.  Though we get the odd few weeks of good weather most summers and the occasional spring or autumn.

&gt;What's the normal middle class life outlook in the UK? Here in the US, it's go to college and get a good job, and that's basically how you win at life. Is it any different in the UK?

They *have* to find flaws, whether because 'I have so much experience in television now' or 'I took literature classes at my local community college'. I've seen excuses far and wide, but I don't see where the conflict really lies.

At the risk of becoming one of 'those' people, I myself have spent my lifetime studying literature, film, and photography. I've even gone to film school with an emphasis on writing/directing. Not once during Doctor Who, at least during the Moffat era, have I ever thought there were mistakes, errors, what have you that were so glaring that they took my focus off of the writing. Or that the writing was ever too terribly bad to begin with. Even with a lot of writing in the RTD era, which I can't say I agree with quite so much, I can still find myself 'letting go' long enough to have at least watched each of the episodes once, and found some way to enjoy myself.

I do not get this attitude where people feel the need to critique every little aspect, try and bring up details about the story that were obviously not meant to be focused towards(IE. 'The episode focused on X, when it really should have focused on Y. Such horrible writing!'), or attempting to call out the writers as being 'wrong'.

There's also an interesting flipside. Straight people cannot get a civil partnership. If you, for whatever reason, wish to enjoy legal privileges with your partner without subscribing to the historical (and religious) connotiations of ""Marriage"", then you have no option. It's a marriage. Tough.

There are also some extremely irritating consequences for trans couples who marry before transisition. Say Andy and Bob married while Andy was still legally Alice. They must get ""divorced"" to get a civil partnership since they couldn't be married anymore. That's a bit dumb.

Participation plays very little in the marks you receive, unless an assignment involves a group presentation. Whether you speak up in class a lot or don't even attend, you can still receive a high grade. 

Professors are similarly accessible and if you cannot get to them, they will gladly communicate via email. 

Classes are labs, seminars and lectures. A lab is a practical session, usually just your class. Seminars are similar in size and are more discussion based. Lectures can be attended by your entire framework in some cases, reaching numbers of 100+ students. In a lecture it's more professor talks, students listen. 

There is homework, usually it is to your benefit that you do it as it will likely tie in to one of your assignments. 

Email is very popular for communication. 

Students have the same level of library access and in some cases a great digital library accessible from home. 

When you say homework do you mean work that counts to your final grade? For us we have our assignments that contribute a percentage to a final grade, as well as being given work to do between sessions.

I believe he needs to mix it up a little more so that the defenders starts guessing again. He showed some excellent signs of this in the Norwich game. Instead of shooting from a difficult angle, he plays it to Sterling, misses, doesn't shoot but plays it to Sahin, instead of dribling all the way to the 11 meter mark he put 2 shots in the back of the net from just outside the box(excluding the goal where the defense made a huge mistake).

The reason he managed to put these shots is becuase of the extra space he is given from the defender who is certain he will dribble and not try to shoot. Just look at the space he is given on the third goal he scored.

As an example; I'm a married man. If I go to the USA and fall ill, and they need my next-of-kin to give consent, my spouse will be the default next-of-kin if the hospital treating me doesn't have my next of kin on file, because the UK has treaties with the USA requiring them to recognise a UK marriage as exactly equivalent to a US marriage. If I were in a civil partnership, US law would ignore my civil partner and contact my parents, as we only bothered to get those treaties in place for marriage. If we had gay marriage, the US would have to contact a gay man's husband, as that's what the treaty requires, even if the bit of the US in question doesn't recognise gay marriage or civil partnership itself.

As another example, if I get a title which comes with a courtesy title for my spouse, my wife receives the courtesy title. If I were in a civil partnership, my partner would get nothing.

Yes, these are paper-cut level problems, but there are lots of them that would be resolved by gay marriage - and some of them require us to go and renegotiate international treaties (not easy) if we want to keep this ""separate but equal"" thing going on.

Finally, a meta-problem: it's relatively easy for a future government to privilege a married couple over a civil partnership by mistake or on purpose (while acting like it was just a mistake if it ever comes to light), because we made the two ""same but equal"" by amending all existing law with the Civil Partnership Act 2004 to cover both marriages and civil partnerships, and now rely on people drafting new laws affecting marriage to remember to include civil partnerships.

are we renaming civil partnerships as 'marriage' or are we renaming marriage to also mean 'civil partnership'?

The opposition to this move is from those that believe 'marriage' doesn't *mean* civil partnership. You may believe it does. but it is a re-definition of a word that has traditionally meant 'man and woman' and many people will continue to use it that way.

true,DrellVanguard,null,null,"First of all I would say that UK universities are as different from one another as they are from other countries, even different departments/facultys will do things differently.

My experience firstly at Liverpool Uni studying physics went like this:

Participation in lectures could vary from lecturer to lecturer, some liked to ask questions and would not move on until they were answered, some liked to foster discussions, other just doled out the facts and explained how to use them.

Office hours were advertised, there was an 'open door' policy, so you could ask any professor about any course.

Most classes were the same, 3 hours of lectures &amp; '6' hours of personal study.

We were examined twice a year on each module individually, these were also quite tough exams.


Lots of homework - there were usually 8 modules on at a time, and each week 2 of them would set homework, which was then submitted and discussed in a small group (3-5 student) tutorials, each with a professor.  Once a month then you would get intense instruction and practice with each module.  These homeworks were hard, often it would take trips to the library to find help with them.

E-mail wasn't used much back then, but this was a few years ago.  We had the 'Blackboard' online academic thingy.

We had access to any books on any subject.


Now again studying medicine at another Uni,  things are different.

Every day I had 2 hours of lectures &amp; 1 hour of small group work on one module in both morning and afternoon.

Not really office hours from Professors but the junior doctors who were employed as educators.  

E-mail could be used to ask for help from professors though, who might arrange to go over stuff with you in office.  They usually have clinical commitments though so that limits time.

E-mail is used massively for class wide notifications.

We could access any book on any subject, including online full text articles.

In the clinical phase of the course now, so this applies less.

**Edit:** Okay. Rather than reply to the posts below individually, I'll save myself some time and clarify here.

No, I don't support burglary. I am however, a critical thinker, and I'm intelligent enough to understand the reasons why burglary exists, and why excusing vicious attacks on intruders is a bad move. 

Crime flourishes where poverty exists, and poverty exists where people are shut out of the economy and exploited. Widespread poverty is a result of living in an unfree economic system where our resources are controlled by an unelected minority.

You don't have to love burglars to understand why giving people a free pass in committing violence is a bad thing. You also don't have to love burglars to understand why a party of sociopaths values human life so little. That, and the inevitable increase in crime due to rising poverty is what my post was about.

While it may be tempting to think of burglars as one-dimensional comic book villains who deserve to be beaten to a pulp, you can't get around the fact that they are still human and have reasons for their behaviour, whether we wish to acknowledge them or not.

I have no more love for burglars than I do for the people who support or enforce the injustices in our system, strip innocent people of their equality and rights (and lives in some cases), and create poverty. 

My opposition to violence against burglars is matched by an opposition to violence against aristrocrats, conservatives, and other self-entitled types who thrive on the abuse of other people. Am I wrong? Should the poorest be pulverising our overprivileged types in self defence? Poverty kills, so it's a legitimate question. People die on our streets every year.

Quality of life here really isn't that good. The poor get a safety net, but it's not really a good standard of living, shoved into a council estate with 1000s of other similar familes. It creates a bad environment, and we can see that generation to generation. 

Even the middle class generally struggle to get by, mostly living paycheck to paycheck because taxes and cost of living are so high.

It's quite hard to break through and get into the upper middle. The best way to do this is to run your own business, but it's hard to run a business here - huge amounts of regulation, complicated (and high) tax and so many laws about employing people make it hard to generate profit. You also generally need a good chunk of cash to risk before opening, which most people don't have. End result - a few enormous businesses owning almost everything. Look at a typical british highstreet for evidence - Phillip Green and big supermarkets own a huge percentage.

So we have high taxes, but a welfare state which isn't really that good but everybody relies on.

How do they know the person in the house with the gun is actually the house-owner? Establishing identity beyond doubt is not a simple process.

How do they know this was a house invasion and not a feud between households? 

How do they know the person shot in self defence and was not attacking the burglar as they attempted to flee? 

The answers to these questions (and many many more) may seem obvious in hindsight but when the police turn up to a house with a body and a person holding a gun/knife they have absolutely no reason to trust the word of the person holding said weapon.

The article also states that Woods was arrested for his own safety after about 50 people descended on his home.

According to The Register, ""He posted some bad taste jokes culled from Sickipedia on a support group for April Jones's family and friends"".

The variety is huge. In my experience (see remark above) science-based courses have much larger class sizes, and less participation (unless you count lab work). 

Arts courses (""liberal arts"") involve more seminars and discussion in smaller groups, and (ah, fuck it, it's true) require considerably less intellectual vigour, as actual knowledge is less important providing you are sufficiently articulate to make a plausible argument. 

By ""homework"" you presumably mean ""coursework"" - there's an awful lot of it. But it's not ""homework"" like school, where you hand it in every lesson - more like a number of essays to be completed each term.

Not all lecturers are professors. Let's call the lot of them ""academics"". They vary *massively* in their knowledge, ability to teach, willingness to deal with undergraduates and so forth. I know fantastic lecturers who still show up at seminars and meetings in professional life from time to time, and are widely respected. And I've had lecturers from barely coherent time-servers who frankly would struggle to hold down a job in McDonalds. 

IMO the key to understanding academic life in Britain is as follows (this is as explained to be by a psychology professor many years ago - I'm sure someone will correct me if this is wrong): an academic's usefulness to their department can be boiled down to the number of undergraduates they can teach, and the number of publications they produce. 

So the ideal is an academic (NB doesn't have to be tenured) who can lecture large groups in popular subjects, and shits out lots of publishable papers. Their ability to *convey* information to students, or *enthuse* them about the subject matter, is entirely peripheral. 

And that is the sort of academic the *system* conspires to produce! Of course there are dedicated people in (hopefully) every department who are genuinely committed to education and helping students. But a higher education version of Dead Poets Society isn't going to happen often. 

edit: apostrophes, how do they work?

Also - this is something that bugs me about UK universities: I used to work as a trainer in professional life. I was expected to be qualified and experienced in the task I was training on, *and* qualified in professional training techniques. Fine. When I was at uni, very few of the lecturers had received *any* formal instruction in how to teach. And they were teaching hundreds of undergraduates every term.

My experience in the UK has been vastly different from Canada. I am currently taking two classes while I'm in Scotland and the credits are equivalent to five classes at home, one would expect the work load to be equivalent, but it is significantly less. 

This semester I only have a presentation, an annotated bibligraphy, and two essays. Then I will take the final exams for these classes in May, even though they end in December. At home I would have upwards of 10 essays, 5 midterms, smaller quizzes, and probably presentations too. 
At home, taking 5 courses I would have upwards of 12 hours of class time per week, and here I only have 4. 

One strange thing I've found is that the professor lecturing is different every week for both classes, but you have a smaller seminar with the same instructor every week, which is helpful, but I find it leads to less continuity during the lectures. Participation counts for these smaller seminars and attendance is taken every time. 

I am used to 3 hours per class/week with the same professor and I appreciate this much more now. I usually get to know my professors and I feel like we cover all the material with plenty of discussion and question time. Here I feel like we rush through all the material. Additionally, I'm used to my professor or perhaps a TA marking my assignments and here it is centralized.

The strangest thing I've found in Glasgow is that they expect you to put in huge amounts of extra, personal reading that will never be tested on, and often rarely discussed. Perhaps it's the lazy college senior in me, but I find this ridiculous. 

Emails are usually answered though, professors are accessible for office hours, and the facilities are quite nice.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; My point is you're specifically fighting for one definition that comes from the same place as many others (and that is the only place the specific man+woman definition comes from), while ignoring the others.

that doesn't make sense, because as you point out I'm not fighting for those *other* definitions. so there must be something about man+woman that transcends the bible, and that is obvious in the history of marriage. 

and by the way I'm not 'fighting' for this definition; it *is* the current definition, legally. I'm pointing out why I think its ridiculous to change it for the personal feelings of the very few gay people who care, but I'm actually pretty resigned to the fact that this is inevitable anyway. I'm not opposed to gay marriage, I've neither for nor against it. I do think the change is unnecessary and pointless (and a tory PR exercise), but such is a lot of what our government does. 

&gt; My point is that these things have changed before, and will change again.

probably. but that doesn't mean your average guy or woman on the street will start calling a man and a man 'marriage'. you can legally redefine the word, it doesn't change what 'marriage' means to people (man/woman). 

&gt; My point is that adhereing to things specifically for the purposes of tradition is not a valid reason to do things.

perhaps, but changing things specifically for the purposes of 'not tradition' isn't a valid reason either. why bother? 

&gt; Your assertion that is has NEVER included same-sex couples is incorrect.[1]

ok, it perhaps did in some instances (hardly overwhelmingly) in Rome and Greece, over 2000 years ago. 

&gt; Yes, a ""redefinition"" (in the minds of some closed-minded people, but it's actually an expansion) is necessary and will come about - no matter how hard anyone campaigns against it. 

sounds a little authoritarian. ""you will obey!""

you could legally redefine the sun to mean the moon, it doesn't change the underlying facts. forgive me if this approach makes me a little nervous...I don't like to see people celebrating the government enforcing what words mean...

&gt;  If we have to wait for the bigots to die out we will do so, but it would be so much less stress for everyone involved if they'd recognise they are on the losing side of history and step aside gracefully. All they're really campaigning for is the propagation of misery in the meantime.

true,DoctorOctagonapus,cnty-uk,Ex Southerner in Yorkshire,"Graduated last summer. My experience:

* Classes consist of a mix of lectures and seminars depending on the subject. Some seminars give a mark for participation, some don't. Lectures don't generally have a mark for participating.
* Professors usually hold office hours unless they are busy doing something else but can always be contacted by e-mail any time of day.
* Class styles depend on the subject. For more technical subjects the material is generally taught by lectures and practical labs, for arts or vocational subjects there tend to be more seminars.
* Announcements are generally made via e-mail but there are noticeboards with things on. Timetables are available via noticeboards and via the local intranet. At the end of the year or degree a list is put up on the noticeboard saying what degree classification you got (1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd, Pass or Fail) but the individual marks are either posted to you or you collect them in an envelope. You are told via e-mail when this happens.
* The amount of coursework vs. exams depends on the course. In my course for example I had a total of six exams the entire three years and everything else was submitted coursework. Other courses are mostly exam based.
* The library is open to everyone who wants to look up information but a book must be borrowed before it can be taken out of the building. There is however a section called Key Texts, which must be booked out for a certain time (usually four hours or overnight if booked at the end of the day) and can only be borrowed at the booked time and returning it later than the specified return time incurs heavy fines.
* The system of fraternities and sororities in America doesn't exist at all in the UK. The closest thing we have in some universities is colleges, such as my uni but there you pick a college that you want to live in. There are however special interest societies that you can join for discussing common interests (Harry Potter society, Medieval Re-enactment society, Gaming society, etc.), common faiths (Christian Union, Islamic society, Atheist and Agnostic society, etc.), common skills (Juggling society, Bellringing society, etc.) and sports teams.
* Generally only first year students live in halls, after that they get into groups and move into private accommodation nearby but there are special student lets geared up for that.

If I referred to my partner just as my partner, you don't know if it's male, female, a casual boyfriend or whatever.

However, I think it is a retaliation against the hypocrisy of the church. That being that a non-religious couple can have a non-religious wedding, but they are still ""married.""

Yet the church (and government it seems) seem to forget about that whenever they address the concept of gay people getting married. I wouldn't have any issue with it if marriage was reserved for the religious version, and everything else was a civil partnership, but if you can have a non-religious marriage, then why stop same-sex marriages? It's not like it's desecrating the church, and by the same token, why CAN'T straight couples have civil partnerships? It's true, they're not allowed to.

true,destria,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I think it depends on your degree subject, in particular, I think sciences/arts-humanities have a very different experience.

Just for context, currently in my 2nd year of studying philosophy at UCL, here's my experience:

* Modules consist of a 1 hour lecture and then a 1 hour seminar. Minimal participation in the lecture (though you can interrupt a prof). Constant interaction in the seminar, which are basically small discussion groups about the previous lecture led by either the TA or the prof. The format largely depends on the leader of the seminar, but I've had ones from presentations each week to just open discussion to group discussions based on handouts.

* 
Professors have office hours. Classes might be cancelled but in my experience, only very occasionally.

* Class schedules are found online. Most information is disseminated online through either a 'Moodle' site or via emails.

* No homework (exception of logic classes) but assessment is either by one formative essay at the end of each module or an essay-based exam. It's very all-in, generally only one piece of work is assessed. You have the option of doing non-assessed work half-way through a module though to get an evaluation of your progress.
* Library books are free to borrow and take out. However some have a 1 day/1 week loan limit.
* In total I only have 8 hours of contact time a week, which is on par for other arts/humanities subjects. I know people in the sciences can have like 20+ though. 
* 
Because of my small number of hours, most of my work is expected to be done independently of university. So I am set readings to do which take me several hours to make comprehensive notes on. I guess this is homework, though obviously it's not graded or goes towards anything; it's just an expectation so that you can participate fully in the seminars.
* The overall emphasis on my course is not historical, i.e. we're not just here to learn about old philosophers and their views and parrot them back. Rather, to do well, the emphasis is on original thought and arguments. Obviously this requires an understanding of a philosopher's viewpoint, but to score high marks, you either demonstrate that you have a very unique take on how you understand a philosopher and how you can support their views...or you rip the philosopher to shreds and criticise and point out flaws in their argument.

As I'm about to go shower for a lecture in a bit probably I'm better placed than most to answer, not that knowing how it was just 5-10 years ago is not interesting

* Classes mostly consist of 1-2 hour lectures. Participation not generaly part of the grade (with some exceptions in other courses
* Professors/lecturers do hold office hours normally once or twice a week for at least an hour, with very rare that they cancel classes.
* Students go online for a personalised timetable. 
* Announcements and lecture slides normally go on Blackboard, Moodle is another popular one.
* Surprisingly little homework, although I expected a more american style as you described. Generally towards 1-2 exams with 1 or 2 coursework assignments spoken is rare but seems quite a comeback in 3rd year
* Very good physical library slightly lacking a digital side

I think scale may help so 

*  Average class size ranges from 350 taking one module in year 1 meaning two split lectures filled the largest lecture room on campus.
* Year 3 size ranges from around 200 down to a few dozen for smaller, non compulsory modules.
* Ignoring maths subjects there is a trend to avoid coursework, and if any written work is given it is normally max 1500 words, 3rd year there is a project of 4-5 people where one spec is a min 3000 word document.
* Timetable wise I started 9am Monday and didn't finish until 5:30pm today I start at 2 and will be back at 4:40 and then two days off before being in Friday afternoon.

England: I only have about 6 hours of classes per week but I am expected to do a lot of background reading. Very much left to your own devices with only 1 or 2 essays for the whole year and then final exams which are an accumulation of the whole years work. I am in a small department so can easily meet with tutors but I imagine larger departments have less time for each student.
 
America:
I found it a lot more like high school. Classes were small and people felt more comfortable with speaking. I had a lot more classes per week and with each class came homework. The work load was much greater but the actual work was easier and shorter such as a one page response paper or a pop quiz the next day (as opposed to a 2000 word or 5 page essay in England) You seem to be spoon fed a lot more, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel students in England are more mature because if the independence they are given.

In America I was much more likely to attend classes as I was registered and had constant homework. In England it is easy to fall behind if you don't have the willpower. 

The libraries in both England and America are great with massive collections both on and offline.

Also every university and department varies so if I did chemistry I am sure my experiences would be very different.

Responding to your points however I would say generally that:

US:

* Student participation is encouraged within reason. Most classes grade students on participation. *Most professors encourage participation because it's good for the class, but I have not heard of being graded on it here.*
* Professors must hold office hours and generally be accessible to students. *Hmm, I'd say this is generally the intent however in practice profs are often busy with other things e.g. research, so tend to post a notice of specific hours when they promise to be in, and welcome you if they happen to be in when you turn up at other times.*
* There's a diversity of class styles. Usually, the more advanced the class, the smaller and more discussion-based it is. *Yes, though it is common to mix huge lectures with small tutorials even for year 1 basic courses.*
* There's a lot of homework. *Kind of. There will be some ""homework"" in the highschool sense of turning in papers, but the vast majority is being told what to read etc to prepare for the next class. It is generally said here that you ""read for a degree"" i.e. most of the learning you do yourself, with the classes giving guidance and going over the rougher bits.*
* Email is used heavily for class-wide notifications. *Varies entirely by the professor and the department's admin staff*
* Students have open access to library books except in special cases (e.g. rare manuscripts). *Depends on the library. At mine we had a section of very popular books which could not be taken outside even a specific zone, until 8pm or something at which point you could sign them out but must return before 9am. These were mainly the books people were supposed to buy. Books less in demand were open access and typically could be signed out for a few nights.*",0,1349783180,null,0,false,0,c6jtvsy,t3_116psi,t1_c6jtvsy,t3_116psi,null,1430102139,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That it was more convenient for lawmakers way back when? That it's endured because it's the most reasonable of all the above definitions? I mean, we don't keep slaves or PoWs anymore. The law changes to reflect the values of the society it exists in; mostly this has involved discarding practices that have fallen from favour, this time it's adding one to reflect that gay people are allowed to be openly so these days.

It's not unnecessary or pointless if it brings happiness to someone at the cost of nothing, is it?

&gt; probably. but that doesn't mean your average guy or woman on the street will start calling a man and a man 'marriage'. you can legally redefine the word, it doesn't change what 'marriage' means to people (man/woman). 

Oh, they will. Not everyone is as stuck in their ways as you seem to believe. And **obviously** not everyone subscribes to that incredibly bigoted and limited view, or this issue wouldn't even be on the table.

&gt; perhaps, but changing things specifically for the purposes of 'not tradition' isn't a valid reason either. why bother? 

But that's not why we're changing it. We're changing it in the name of real equality, as opposed to the fake compromise we're given now.

&gt; sounds a little authoritarian. ""you will obey!""

&gt;you could legally redefine the sun to mean the moon, it doesn't change the underlying facts. forgive me if this approach makes me a little nervous...I don't like to see people celebrating the government enforcing what words mean...

It's simple fact. The younger generations are far more open and tolerant than the older ones. They will win simply by outliving the bigots. There is nothing any of the older generation can do to stop it -- they WILL die eventually, the definition and the law WILL change.

What you think is, quite frankly, irrelevant.

&gt; wow ok. ""change your opinion bill"" passed by Tory government, 2013. 'less stress'? I suppose it would be less stress if everyone adopted my personal opinions overnight.

The point I am making here is that they cannot possibly win. This is not going to go away even if you defeat it once, twice, a hundred times. We will simply wait for you to die off and do it anyway. You will never ensure a lasting legacy of your outdated definitions. As soon as you're in the ground everything you've worked for will crumble like the pathetic house of cards it is.

So what can be done? To be honest there isn't a lot that can be done. The two political parties are both anti-offensive/pro-PC moderates who are doing what the public wants them to do. You have a handful of almost-retired conservatives who are still more freedom of speech but these people are rare and dying (literally).    

There are a few minority parties like the Pirate Party who view freedom of speech as an asset but due to the UK's electoral system and lack of PR they will never get a seat. ",0,1349784937,null,0,false,0,c6ju2yd,t3_116vf0,t1_c6ju2yd,t3_116vf0,null,1430102229,65,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,65

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; It's ridiculous to protect the rights of a much victimised minority? That's a strange whine from someone who claims to be christian.

it's not protecting the rights of gays; they already have identical rights as pointed out. 

It's redefining a legal term to mean something else, so that those few gay people who want it can feel good and so that David Cameron can get a boost in the polls. 

&gt; And anyway, I'm not gay and I do care. The implicit homophobia is not pleasant and has no place in law, even if it's just in the language and not in the terms. I find your idea that only gay people care about homophobia and discrimination to be a bit odd tbh.

far from it, I don't think I've *ever* discussed this issue with someone who was gay. It always seems to be people who aren't gay. I understand they feel they are fighting for the rights of a victimised minority. I simply think the fight is over and I really don't see the need for this gay marriage debate at all. 

&gt; If it's important to a religion that marriage be restricted in a way that's not compatible with society, then it should not be able to provide legal marriages. Instead make everything a civil partnership that is recognised through the state, and make ""marriage"" a religious concept with no basis in law. Simple. Then you can be happy and I can be happy.

well yes this is the point. I don't really have a problem with this, but the government does and would never go for it. 

The way the cookie crumbles is that by defining marriage you must force the CofE to at least *allow* the possibility of gay marriages within its premises. CofE doesn't want to do that, so either you force them and they do it, or you disestablish the church from the state.

are you sure about this one? would you be interested in a life long wager? 

put it this way, do you think in 50 years people will no longer use the term 'gay marriage'? 

&gt; I'm eager because it shows you that you can never win. Let me repeat that. It is inevitable that the change that we are discussing will come to pass. The only difference is whether you will live to see it. There is a light at the end of the tunnel for me, one that serves as a train running you down.

yes, yes, mr. 1984. I get it. you will win at all costs, behind us marches Germany, in front of us Germany, Germany Germany over all. but if you're so confident why are you so animated? do you ever stop and wonder if you're having to talk yourself into this?

we have same sex equality and it has taken nothing away from me.

It is easy when you demagogue dissenters, it's just not effective. If I could offer you a slither of advise; avoid this approach.

""Free speech is sacred"". Bullshit. That's an American line of bullshit. You can't punch someone in the face and expect to get away with it. Why should you be able to do the psychological equivalent and get away with it? Are you guys saying psychological harm is no harm? Well it is harm. People take it very seriously.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2639959/Emotional-pain-hurts-more-than-physical-pain-researchers-say.html

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/charting-the-depths/200912/physical-pain-and-emotional-pain-more-similar-you-think

This free speech is sacred line is a myth. It's not sacred. We have laws governing behaviour and we don't get up in arms about them. Speech is behaviour. Speech is communication. Communication is very powerful. The thoughts and words of other people have a powerful effect on us. We're social animals. Words can be incredibly powerful. They have incredible power to wound. They demonstrate the intentions of others. It's naive to think we should be allowed to say whatever we want, whenever we want, regardless of how much harm it does to others. That is just another stupid aspect of the American constitution. Just because American gets a fucking hardon over free speech and proclaim it a sacred principle, it doesn't mean it is. They're wrong.

And don't come out with the slippery slope, Orwellian argument. Laws largely keep in step with social consensus. This law is not draconian, the arrest of this man corresponds with the outrage felt by millions of normal people. Sorry, but we have to respect those people, *even if we're not like them*.

Let me point out, I don't have a problem with trolls on the internet. I don't get all agitated over things people say. I don't worry about what people think or get offended by it, because I don't think it's necessary, I think it's stupid. But I recognise that that's unusual. It is human nature to get offended when people, even complete strangers, insult you. Particularly when someone's died. Because of the strength of feeling of the majority of people, I don't think this particular law is unjust, neither is the arrest, because that is what can be expected when you break the law. This law is not Orwellian, because it reflects the will of the public, it reflects the social mood.

Sorry, but that's my view. I am a liberal person, but the reason I am liberal is because *I respect the feelings of others*. That is what makes me liberal, I care when someone is upset, that is why I stand against unfairness. But in this case the unfairness of arresting one man is smaller, in my estimation as a caring, liberal, empathetic human being, than the emotional hurt and outrage caused to the family of the girl, their friends, and people around the country who are concerned for the girl. If you can't see that, then you are discounting the feelings of all those people. You are saying that the feelings of those people are *unimportant*. That they *don't count*. All those people, really? The feelings of all those people are not important? But the right of one man to be a dick on this internet is? His right to be a dick on the internet is more important than the hurt feelings of millions of people? To me, that doesn't add up.

That 9% (on everything over £21k) is totally worth it if you go on to get a good graduate job.

Language otherwise insulting may be used in an unpejorative, even affectionate, way, or may be adopted as a badge of honour (‘Old Contemptibles’).

Had he made the comment in real life, my reaction would have been rather more serious than how I reacted when someone told me yesterday that ""Nirvana is music to blow your brains out to...""- a derisive snort, groan, shake of the head, and an ""oh dear, not cool"", but depending on the context, chances are we would remain friends, although my respect for him would drop.

That's exactly how ***in an ideal society*** (I'm well aware this doesn't really work in real life), free speech moderation should work; sure, he should have to face consequences for saying something so horrible, but putting him in prison as a stretch rather far.

I mean, free speech is very good, but where should the line be drawn on this grey subject? Because you can't have people being outright racist or deliberately attacking others and then claim, ""oh free speech"" when it was an attack against someone or a group.

Do we consider hate, only hatred when violence is involved? 

The fact is, when you voice an opinion online of hate, people have a choice. You have the choice to ignore the statement or ignore the person altogether. You are not obliged to read it. But in person the situation can be different, because if someone walks up to you and is directly offensive towards you and making extremely offensive vocal points, this is no longer free speech, this is an attack which can not be avoided besides walking away (which you can't necessary escape from) or retaliating.

I think Suarez is trying hard when he shouldn't at all because it's there. 

There's no doubt the contact is there, we all know it (i.e. Norwich). I don't think he just dives to dive (Stoke pissed me off when he did that), but he's on a magnifying glass. He's either got to keep his legs moving like Messi does or choose his battles wisely to the likes of Ronaldo.

With a player of his class, he's going to get the contact regardless - I just want the calls if he's going to be on the ground and out of the play.

&gt;Marriage doesn't belong to people like your parents for them to have any right to decide what does or doesn't sanctify it.

I also don't understand what you mean by this; since when can a given person claim 'ownership' of a given word? This is an issue of social definitions, isn't it? In which case if a sizeable group of people disagree with another (roughly) equal sizable group of people, then you reach a compromise. That's democracy, after all.

&gt;The system's inefficiencies could be tolerated in a period of high growth, but not in today's climate of economic stagnation...By 2035 health care's share of GDP will roughly double, according to McKinsey, a consultancy. The burden falls on the state, which foots two-thirds of the bills. Politicians are unwilling to raise taxes, so they squeeze suppliers instead: more than three-quarters of public hospitals operate at a loss...income is partly determined by numbers of tests and drugs prescribed, and there are fewer of these for children and pregnant women. Doctors are worked to the bone for relatively low pay (around $125,000 a year at mid-career). One doctor in his 30s says he works more than 100 hours a week...The Japanese are only a quarter as likely as the Americans or French to suffer a heart attack, but twice as likely to die if they do...The system is slow to adopt cutting-edge (and therefore costly) treatments.

I've studied law in Scotland, Sweden and the Netherlands and my experience of them has been that they are all pretty much the same (except for the first two years in Scotland which were the mandatory courses and included lectures of 200 people - the two years after that it was seminar groups which is more the norm in the other two, although the Netherlands has lectures too, albeit a bit smaller).

They all encourage discussion in the seminar setting - I'd say Sweden is more relaxed about it and it is very much a *discussion* rather than something structured around pre-agreed points. ""Homework"" hasn't really been a thing in any of them, although assignments are far more regular in the first two years in Scotland than any of the others, followed by the Netherlands and then Sweden last. The variety of exams varies a lot more outside of Scotland - take home exams, presentations, oral exams and *long* (8 hour) exams being used in the Netherlands or Sweden, while Scotland was very much stuck with normal, three-hourish exams supplemented by some written papers done over the year. I've never had ""participation"" as something contributing to the final grade though.

The structure of the year is very different in Scotland as well - sometimes up to 8 courses on the go at once (in the first two years, only two or three at a time after that), for a whole semester or year, while in Sweden it's one or two courses at a time for half a semester, and in the Netherlands likewise.

Law libraries are always pretty well stocked so I think the comparison there is pretty meaningless - they're all good, anyway, especially online.

The Netherlands has been the most organised in my experience - regular updates on special online noticeboards and through email. Scotland second - a noticeboard and email also used but much easier to miss things. Sweden was incredibly disorganised (can you see a pattern? They seem incredibly laid back about education there) - most updates just through class or an email in exceptional circumstances.

Professors were pretty accessible in each - much more matey in Sweden but perfectly friendly in the others as well. No such thing as ""office hours"" but you could easily make an appointment or drop by hopefully in each place.

Or is it the fact that this opinion was 'communicated *electronically*'? If a citizen were to e-mail a friend telling them that they believe ""All soldiers should die and go to hell"", is that illegal? What if one of us voiced this opinion on Reddit right now?

Secondly, SRS also brands itself a circlejerk - it's right there in the sidebar.

Thirdly, your insistence that they should simply just 'get off Reddit' seems remarkably hard line.  Reddit (unlike /b/, i would argue) has become a wide reaching and multifaceted shared space on the internet, from which people can take what they choose.  Asking them to leave is like suggesting to people relaxing in a municipal park that, should they see a man defecate into the duck pond, they should find somewhere else to spend their time, rather than offer reproachment.

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"Just wrote to my MP in Parliament:

&gt; Dear Bob Ainsworth,
&gt; 
&gt; Apologies in advance for the long email. I have endeavoured to remain concise in my writing.
&gt; 
&gt; It has come to my attention recently through various news outlets that people in England are being jailed for various offensive comments made on the Internet, through various social media websites, including that of Facebook and Twitter.
&gt;
&gt; Comments such as ""all soldiers should die and go to hell"" by Azhar Ahmed of West Yorkshire and tasteless jokes regarding recent child abduction events by Matthew Woods of Lancashire to cite two examples. Both of which received a community order and was jailed for 3 months respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that these punishments are too severe. The ""all soldiers should die and go to hell"" comment is simply a matter of opinion. Whilst some may view soldiers as the bravest of the brave, sacrificing themselves for their country, others may view them simply as killers and detest them for what they do. I think it simply ridiculous that a man should be punished for expressing his opinion on Facebook of all places, even if he did so untactfully. Anybody sensible in parliament knows there has to be a limit on Free Speech, but that should only be for extremely limited circumstance, such as for protection of the country and its people, for which legislation already exists that excludes protection for simply being offended by somebody's comments.
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew Jones' ""jokes"" are extremely distasteful and would naturally offend people, as they are jokes designed to offend. Countless jokes exist like this so much so that they have their own designated category. People were so outraged by this, a 50-odd mob collected outside of his house in retaliation with intents unknown at least to me, but presumably not kind ones. Surely this mob's reaction is a far worse offence than his jokes? But this young man receives a 3 month jail sentence to appease the public outrage?
&gt; 
&gt; A very significant point of this is that these messages were not directed toward a single person in particular; that is the nature of most social media posts. These people did not write a letter and post it deliberately to people in order to solely cause offense, upset and/or harass. They were publically available posts that one must purposefully navigate to in order to view and are easily ignorable. If these men purposefully and directly messaged the subjects of their comments with their comments, then that shifts the paradigm of how their actions should be viewed. In this case, there is no harassment and no apparent specifically targeted malice. I am certain many will agree, but it has not yet reached a point where most people are bothering to shout about it.
&gt; 
&gt; In closing, I believe that the public reaction to a person's comments is punishment enough. Being disliked or detested by your community as a result of your actions is a punishment by itself. Additional punishment from the government is wholly unnecessary and sets a bad precedent for people when they consider sharing their opinion to others, particularly over social media.
&gt;

As for being non-profit - you're right that hospitals themselves can't profit, but the healthcare industry does still thrive on competition and reputation, and the companies make money from extra activities - like you can pay to upgrade to a nice room with a big TV and en-suite, and you can go to a recovery spa after your operation.

As for the stats - there's so many ways of interpreting them. i.e. maybe we have more heart attacks in the West and so we are better at spotting them and dealing with them.

But he was a famous person and they were teenage girls so they weren't believed or taken seriously. Remember this is in the days before police databases, one police force wouldn't necessarily be aware others had investigated the same man before. Oh and the internet rumours didn't come from no where.... people at the BBC and in the police and the press gossiped about it plenty and they hinted at it as far as they dared (Simon Hoggart calling him 'Britain's most popular celebrity paedophile' in off air whilst recording The News Quiz, Colleen Nolan, Louis Theraux, et al.) but without proof he probably would have won a libel case so no one risked a direct accusation. In retrospect we know the weight of evidence as others have come forward but before his death it was much more murky.

I don't see compelling signs of a big conspiracy at the police or the wider BBC other than incompetence and lack of moral courage.

Marriage predates, and has not always been, a religious institution. Until the mid-17th century marriage was a civil affair (ie purely legal), and it was not necessary to have any religious component.

The way I see it is this:

Marriage is a legal contract. If two (or more I suppose), consenting adults want to enter in to that contract, that's fine. If they want to go through a religious ritual at the same time, that's ok too.

If a religious group doesn't want to let gay people have a religious ceremony with their marriage, then that's their right. I don't have to like it, but I can't force it on them either.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"First of all, it is highly likely that privatised healthcare will cost more money!  More, not less, more.  The shareholders will want their nice, big, juicy slices of the pie.  In some fantasy Britain, the government would cut taxes, but in the real world, any savings made in the NHS will be unlikely passed onto the tax payers.  Cutting the amount of tax money towards healthcare doesn't magically make it cheaper, we'd end up paying the shortfall and then some out of our own pockets.

Secondly, the [NHS is one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the developed world](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/07/nhs-among-most-efficient-health-services)!  The constant complaints about it costing too much is unfounded and based entirely on political ideology.  Healthcare costs a lot.  It's an inevitable consequence of modern medicine.  If we go private, the perverse incentive is to cut care and quality to boost profits.  Read [Road to Serfdom by Hayek](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_serfdom.html) on private markets and capitalism, you seem incredibly ignorant and naive about these things.

&gt;squeezing doctors, drug companies and suppliers - great!

How is it great to have poorly paid doctors working ridiculously long hours (100 hours a week)?  One of the main complaints The Economist makes is that Japan has a massive shortage of doctors.  I seriously doubt the drug companies and suppliers will be squeezed.  In a private market, they'll have much more power over smaller healthcare entities in comparison to a national behemoth.  If anything their profits will soar at our expense, but that's alright because many politicians bought shares in those companies before privatisation.

The other point.  No, money isn't the only issue in the entire world.  There's the quality of life.  Quality healthcare should be the primary objective, not keeping Stalinist gummit out o' my healthcare.  It's worth paying money for the most important needs in life.  This year we spent good money on the olympics, the royal wedding, the royal jubilee, but apparently there's no money for healthcare - one of the most essential things in life? 

As I've linked elsewhere, a study has found that increasing competition in healthcare leads to lower quality and higher death rates.  Only a complete idiot would prioritise omg big screen TV over that.

When it comes to cutting costs, you should know that tens of billions are lost due to tax avoidance by large corporations.

**Elitist England: Shelvey the latest proof of the big-six bias holding Hodgson back**

The Liverpool youngster is the latest of several players from the most glamourous clubs rushed into international duty prematurely ahead of more deserving candidates

COMMENT
By George Ankers


There was a joyless inevitability about the news of Jonjo Shelvey's call-up to the England squad.

People called for the side to be refreshed, infused with younger blood after Euro 2012 and that remains the right thing to do. Players should be picked at the start of a qualification campaign who will be in a position to excel two summers later.

There is a difference, however, between picking new players who need to use those two years to learn their way around international football and picking new players who still need to learn their own game.

Shelvey is clearly going to pick up his fair share of caps for England in the years to come but he is some way off being ready for senior international football. He has yet to define and secure his role in the Liverpool team, yet to mature personally and professionally – witness his startlingly immature behaviour in the wake of his red card against Manchester United.

Regardless of whether or not Jonny Evans should have walked as well, lashing out at Sir Alex Ferguson and then following it up with a lunge-tackle goal celebration in a subsequent game betrays the fact that the 20-year-old has a lot of growing-up to do.

If Shelvey had put in his handful of promising recent performances (and they are promising) across the city for Everton, his inclusion for the Three Lions would be seen as a joke. Why pick an obviously raw young talent off the back of a few good games when many others have proved more on a regular basis for years?

Shelvey is not the only one to be called up having done very little, seemingly only because he has done it at a top-six side.

Already in Roy Hodgson's short tenure, Martin Kelly, also of Liverpool, made it in to the 23-man squad for Euro 2012 as cover at right-back. He had played just 20 games that season, performing encouragingly for one of his age but already clearly needing to be moved to centre-back.

Tony Hibbert, a specialist right-back, reliable and capable, with over 250 Premier League games to his name, could consider himself a saint not for making a Grant Holt-like outburst. The Everton man is not the next Gary Neville but, if Glen Johnson had got injured, there can be no argument as to which of he and Kelly you would have preferred in a major tournament match there and then.

Again, Kelly may well go on to pick up many caps for England, but bringing a youngster along for the experience at a European Championship who may not even be able to dislodge Martin Skrtel and Daniel Agger at his club in time for 2014? There was no sense in it.

Again at Liverpool, Raheem Sterling's recent introduction to the senior set-up before even a single Under-21 match was ludicrous. Some exciting stepovers and one excellent cross against Manchester City were far from a case to bring the winger in ahead of Nathan Dyer, so outstanding for Swansea City last season.

Sterling is another who would do well to be developed enough for a role in Brazil in 2014 but the slightest hype at Anfield and into the squad he comes.

An encouraging counterpoint to the 17-year-old's call was that of Adam Lallana. At 24, the Southampton captain fits the bill exactly of a player who is young enough to play a part for many years to come but has done the work at club level to prepare himself for international duty first.

Over three increasingly impressive seasons, Lallana has polished his game, blossoming into a player clearly far above Championship level, and matured enough to earn the skipper's armband at St Mary’s Stadium. He offers freshness to England but is also a complete player, a ready-made option for Hodgson.

So why, when Frank Lampard gets a knock, does Shelvey get the nod? Lallana goes forgotten and Leon Osman, another unsung player in a similar position to the Liverpool youngster, is overlooked once again as well.

This is not only a bias towards Liverpool. Look at Manchester United's Tom Cleverley. Again, the midfielder has obvious ability and potential but only made 15 appearances in 2011-12, a season which should have been key to his growth had he not been injured.

His rawness was obvious against Ukraine in September when, in the No.10 role, he was skittish and ill-composed. Cleverley will have a role to play going forward but both he and England would be better served if he concentrated on learning at Old Trafford first.

Hodgson is not the first to exhibit this bias towards players from the ""big six"" but is on track to take it further than before. As well as those mentioned, Ryan Bertrand is still yet to do anything of serious note at Chelsea. James Milner runs around perfectly well but so do countless others in the Premier League.

Danny Welbeck has not disgraced himself for England so far but will clearly struggle to continue his development with regular first-team action in the bolstered attacking ranks at United. Meanwhile, in Scotland they decry Celtic goal-machine Gary Hooper's absence from the international reckoning.

Holt's rant was brash but he had a point - his demonstration of all-round ability and goals against the league's best warranted a test in a friendly or two. Rickie Lambert of Southampton's ability has been clear to regular watchers for some time. Danny Graham of Swansea City must be knocking on the door too. And that is just up front.

Scott Sinclair: Overlooked this summer for Stewart Downing. Leon Britton: Ignored in favour of Jordan Henderson. Jonny Howson is at the very least no further away from the required level than Henderson, nor Newcastle's Danny Simpson compared to Kelly. Dyer. Lallana. Osman. Hibbert.

Rather than throw youngsters in before they are ready, when fans will expect results immediately, Hodgson needs to look beyond the small splashes in the big ponds and put some faith in those thriving in smaller waters.",0,1349802194,null,0,false,0,c6jxsgq,t3_116wle,t1_c6jxsgq,t3_116wle,null,1430103986,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,roodammy44,cnty-expat,Norway,"That's not quite true. What happened is that the government allowed private healthcare in addition to the state funded healthcare. We already had this situation in the UK in the time of the NHS.

In England it was the opposite - when healthcare was nationalised, our infant mortality went down. This is because people could go to the doctor whereas previously they could not afford it. In India, shortages of govt care were inevitable because of the extreme poverty. It's such a different situation that I don't even know where to start, although the per-capita spending on healthcare would be a good place.

It's not quite right to compare management by the British state with that of the Indian state, which is one of the most corrupt and bureaucratic in the world.

She got a text from them today saying they are increasing the monthly charge w.e.f. November 1st.

It is only a small increase, but as it's less than a 10% increase and lower than inflation, it is legitimate for them to do so without us having the right to bail out of the contract.

Which? have complained to them, and need more pledges - details on my link.

I've already said in other comments that I don't think he should have been jailed. But I wasn't *quite* so outraged as everyone else here that he was. I think the reason is that I took some account of the sensibilities of the public, whereas nobody else here seems to have done that. Everyone here seems to have taken a strongly one-sided view of the matter, completely discounting any injury done to anyone who was offended by the jokes. I've tried to point out that people do take these things quite seriously. Consider, for, example, that the outrage felt by many members of the public might be just as strong as the outrage people on this subreddit feel that Woods was jailed. There are probably millions of people around the country who would have punched him for the jokes he told. We may think they are overreacting, but we'd probably find that we're in a minority. I've also said, in fact I said it in the comment you were replying to, that I think it's stupid to take offence at things people say. But that doesn't mean I see this case as completely unjust. Millions of people have been deeply offended by one guy, he ends up going to jail for twelve weeks. I don't think it's going to ruin his life. In an ideal world, people would not have taken these jokes so seriously. But we don't live in a ideal world. We have to face up to the reality of human nature. We can't just make everyone suddenly stop being offended by things like this. The judge took account of the public outrage in his sentencing. I mean, the public outrage was significant. Can we really just dismiss widespread public outrage? And can we do it in order to protect something which doesn't seem like it really needs to be protected that strongly, i.e. silly jokes like these? I'm not saying the jokes shouldn't be told between friends. It's just unfortunate that they got out into the wider world, but they did, and that was a risk Woods must have been aware of, or should have been, really.

true,wubblewobble,eng-sussex,West sussex,"&gt; Would you defend the right of far-right groups to publicly make racist jokes at minorities? What about bullying jokes which drive schoolchildren to kill themselves? All fine are they?

That would be harassment which implies a repeated nature. I support laws protecting against a harassment. I don't support laws against telling crap jokes or for ""causing"" offense.

I find plenty of people offensive as in ""annoying / irritating / causing displeasure"" every day on my journey through life for various reasons. If I find them especially annoying I might make a mental note ""avoid that guy when possible and don't do him any favours due to him being a gigatic cunt"". 

Should it be a crime to offend people? No because essentially at the root of it, there's a strong correlation between ""offensive"" and ""has different opinions"", and learning to play nicely with the other kids is a big part of growing up.

Should it be a crime to harass people? Yes, because that's repeated and its only purpose is to try to make the target's life hell.

&gt; When laws against racist speech were enacted, for example, was that progressive, or not progressive, in your view?

Not. Equality comes from treating everyone the same. Not making up rules specifically to cater for minorities. It makes harassment of the racist flavour suddenly worse than harassment of the non-racist flavour where in fact they're exactly the same thing. It kind of implies that there's a good reason for harassing people and that some how ""harassed because his skin is a certain colour"" is somehow morally worse than ""harassed because he looked at me strangely"" or ""harassed because his sister turned me down"".

You are entirely wrong, they *do* give marriage rights. All legal, Social, and Fiscal rights are exactly the same as marriage.

Difference but not necessarily inequality. A black man and a white man are different, but they are equal.

There are no differences.

#1 It's not ever said directly to the person, it's 'shouted to the world' so to speak - but it's not ever said directly to the person. If it's directed at one particular account/person, there is still a barrier of anonymity &amp; a barrier of digitalness to the real world that doesn't exist in the street.

#2 Body Language &amp; the way things are said are critical as to distinguish whether what's said is meant in a malicious way or a stupid/non-aggressive way. Just look at the John Terry case if you want a high profile example of this, body language is far more important than the words in my view &amp; there is no body language on a facebook post.

#3 What's said online is obviously going to be more harsh than what's said on the street, this is due to the veil of anonymity &amp; the fact there's no social obligation to behave. You shouldn't consent to view the offensive material by accepting the t&amp;cs of the website &amp; subsequently loading the page to view the offensive material. It's not like you can't **stop the abuse** at any time by pressing a big red X on the top right of your screen. Just compare what is said on 4chan.org (specifically /b/) to what is said by that quiet guy in your office, one of which is really polite whereas the other is vulgar but funnily enough they're the same person, the only reason they do it online is because it's anonymous.

#4 This specific ""joke"" and this specific case was actually written on a semi-private space, as outlined by the article:
 &gt; A teenager who posted explicit comments and jokes about April Jones on his Facebook page has been jailed for 12 weeks.

These were on **his** facebook page, not an April Jones memorial page. This was his own joke (well, it wasn't even his joke)/view in his own private circle of friends &amp; wasn't broadcasted to thousands of people &amp; wasn't directed at the family of April Jones. **Do you seriously advocate the arrest &amp; jailing of those who make politically incorrect jokes on semi-private web pages which will never be viewed by the AJ family or anybody associated with them?**

It shouldn't be *illegal* to be offensive. It's enough that it's *offensive* and a mature society should be able to discuss *why* it's offensive. 

Because not far down this road, it would be illegal to insult soldiers. Or to discuss how the definition of ""mercenary"" applies in the context of a professional army.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"&gt;First of all, it is highly likely that privatised healthcare will cost more money! More, not less, more. 

Which isn't the case in other countries, but that doesn't matter. We aren't talking about disbanding the NHS. I was saying in my original post that knee-jerk ""private - bad"" sentiment is silly. It's a problem of implementation, not ideology.

&gt;The shareholders will want their nice, big, juicy slices of the pie. 
And what's wrong with that? If the service is better for customers/patients, who cares?

&gt;In some fantasy Britain, the government would cut taxes, but in the real world, any savings made in the NHS will be unlikely passed onto the tax payers. Cutting the amount of tax money towards healthcare doesn't magically make it cheaper, we'd end up paying the shortfall and then some out of our own pockets.

You might be right, but at no point did I say we should privatise the NHS.

&gt;Secondly, the NHS is one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the developed world! The constant complaints about it costing too much is unfounded and based entirely on political ideology. Healthcare costs a lot. It's an inevitable consequence of modern medicine. If we go private, the perverse incentive is to cut care and quality to boost profits. Read Road to Serfdom by Hayek on private markets and capitalism, you seem incredibly ignorant and naive about these things.

Again, at no point did I suggest replacing the NHS. I'm saying that private involvement isn't always bad. Pharmacies, GP surgeries, many dentists etc are good examples of well-functioning, private, parts of the NHS. They're heavily regulated by the government, and they function great.

&gt;How is it great to have poorly paid doctors working ridiculously long hours (100 hours a week)? One of the main complaints The Economist makes is that Japan has a massive shortage of doctors. I seriously doubt the drug companies and suppliers will be squeezed. In a private market, they'll have much more power over smaller healthcare entities in comparison to a national behemoth. If anything their profits will soar at our expense, but that's alright because many politicians bought shares in those companies before privatisation.

What matters is the service. It isn't public concern how many hours doctors work. They choose the job, and know the score. The public don't whine that truck drivers work long hours. This is a silly point. And if hospitals want to recruit more doctors, they can raise salaries. Look at the UK - our doctors don't earn much compared to in the US, yet trying to get a place on a medicine course in the UK is extremely competitive.

As for bargaining power, you are right. The NHS actually does get decent prices, but similar things can occur in other countries. For instance in Germany, groups of pharmacies (which are almost 100% privately owned by individuals - they don't have chains like boots/lloyds) get together to form buying groups to get better deals from importers. The exact same thing would happen in a private system (which again, I'm not proposing outright..)

And yes, I agree that the royal wedding, jubilee and olympics etc should only be funded if they bring in a net gain for the country. Our taxpayer money should be used to improve the country for everybody, and these events should be treated like investments and designed to give a good return.

And yes, I absolutely support clamping down on tax avoidance and not having wars in countries we don't care about.

Just to reiterate my original point - I'm not saying the NHS should go private. I'm saying that not all private involvement is bad. If done correctly, integrating private elements into the system can work well, delivering more than a government-run system could, at less cost. It really isn't that complicated, but nobody seems to be able to grasp this and just gets all angry about the thought of somebody profiting from healthcare. As I said originally, the NHS is a dynamic organisation which continually develops - we shouldn't resist all change, but rather we should assess each proposal on it's own merit and not oppose things based on ideology alone.",0,1349812083,null,0,false,0,c6k0ivt,t3_116tru,t1_c6k0ivt,t1_c6jx25p,null,1430105265,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

**Democracy** = political system under which the government is decided by a fair election amongst the entire population.

**Captialism** = economic system under which people are free to bring their capital into competition with the capital of other people in order to get more capital.

What this is, is a right-wing government trying to erode the rights of the people in order to line their own pockets and the pockets of their benefactors. It's about changing the rules of capitalism to give more favor to those who have a lot of capital, and pretending it's about ""fostering enterprise"" or similar nonsense.

true,ViamnotacrookV,null,null,"Honestly I think the Spain's False 9 would have worked a lot better if they had a more attacking player than Xavi in that 10 role. In my opinion, take it for what it is, the False 9 should operate such that when the ball is passed to the CF (the 'False 9') he should back track as the CAM runs up and the Wingers pinch into the box. His job is to then find the pass to one of those 3. (This is pretty different from the standard model of 'the false 9 gets the ball and turns into the #10 role player looking for ANY pass) Note, my 'False 9' relies heavily on the Wingers being in the right place. Spain played it such that Fabregas would get the ball, pass it backwards, and then run forwards. I think Torres just made their play simpler because they knew he would be going forward and looking to get on net.

That being said, I think with Mata and Hazard as our Wingers, with Oscar at the #10 spot and Moses/De Bruyne able to play a 'False 9', we could conceivably perform it better than the Spanish side.",0,1349813540,null,0,false,0,c6k0xwv,t3_117jym,t1_c6k0xwv,t1_c6k0ps0,null,1430105461,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,kraftymiles,green,Sports&amp;Annexe,"You see the letter from a Mr Robert M Attack to George Ferguson?

Dear george, I am a great admirer of your regenerative projects in the city.
I read your campaign leaflet and am considering voting for you, so I hoped you might answer a few questions.
As you are running for a public office, I thought an open letter appropriate.

Can you truly describe yourself as an independent candidate, while being a member of the merchant venturers, an exclusive club that have many business interests in the city.
Even if you were to leave such an organisation, wouldn't your personal relationships with individuals and companies in the group present a potential conflict of interest? Considering that, if elected you would have enormous political influence over the future planning and development of Bristol.

As a 'national and international roving ambassador for the city', do you believe that being a member of the Merchant Venturers, who played a major role in the Anglo-African slave trade, Making a vast fortune from the abduction, exploitation and in many cases murder of over 3 million Africans, is the best way to represent Bristol in the modern global village?

As a champion of the arts , will plans for art funding extend to the working class and multi-ethnic areas of Bristol?
It was disappointing in a year when that the Cultural Olympiad made cash available to inspire projects that reflected Britain's cultural diversity, the St Pauls carnival, the city's only historic and authentic multicultural event, was cancelled due to poor organisation and resources.

I am hoping that with your history of opposition to the seemingly relentless supermarket proposals within Bristol, that you may be able to affect change in the area of planning proposals regarding this issue. Particularly in the way that the big franchises manage to open predatory ""Metro' style stores in independent shopping areas, at times without explicit notice, offering the local community no opportunity to contest.

The only thing you can do in situations like this is tell the person how much of a dickhead they are for saying something so offensive. If you don't want to do that, then just ignore them. If this guy posted the joke for attention DON'T GIVE HIM ANY!

&gt; (a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character; or

&gt; (b)causes any such message or matter to be so sent.

&gt; (a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network, a message that he knows to be false,

&gt; (b)causes such a message to be sent; or

&gt; (c)persistently makes use of a public electronic communications network.

true,tachyons22,null,null,"Hi, I'm an American (Connecticut though, so other side of the country, but just as hoity toity and prententious), and I'm at my first year at UKC, but I'm doing my full course here.

Food: I'd suggest Cafe Mauresque, La Trappiste, Deeson's, and the Forge. Deeson's is the most expensive out of all of them, and I think the main course is around £18 average. I've eaten at all of them and they're all amazing. If you like dim sum, Supernoodles is the closest I've found that has dim sum meals. The best dim sum I've had in England was at a place in Worthing, though that's pretty far. Supernoodles is kind of expensive, but the chicken feet isn't bad. For Indian, I really like this place called The Ancient Raj. Pretty cheap, very delicious. Plus, free delivery on orders over £12! I haven't found a good French place, but then again I'm very picky and spoiled with French food, so I tend to cook my own French food.

Groceries: If you like Trader Joe's, check out Waitrose. It's on the other side of town from the uni, but it's like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. A lot of organic, delicious fruits and meats. Closer to the uni, but more expensive, is the Goods Shed. It's a farmer's market in an old barn and it's incredible. It's the most expensive place for food that I've been to in Canterbury, but well worth it.

Alcohol: I'm partial to a wine shop called the Wild Ferment. It's up past La Trappiste and the guys that run it are amazing. Very kind and helpful. The Goods Shed is also a good place to check out, but more for beers.

Shopping: Whitefriars is about it. I like Fenwicks, which is like a more expensive Nordstrom, and Marks and Spencers, which is like a Nordstrom/expensive Macy's. Zara is nice, and they have pretty good sale stuff. Topshop is okay, but they seem to be a little on the cheap side in terms of quality. Monsoon and Jigsaw are great for dresses. French Connection is kind of hit and miss for me, like Express was back home. There are quite a few used bookshops in town, but my favourite is Chaucer Bookshop down on Beer Cart Lane.

true,mr-mistoffelees,cnty-wales,Wales,"29 years old, pretty much where I want to be although looking. I've always been employed. Left school at 18 with two crap A-Levels. Had a job lined up starting the following September. I've not been unemployed since.

I'm employed in the public sector and have a good, secure job - I'm at managerial level now, and as a result have sat on a number of interview panels. 

The following is personal opinions, but those opinions seem popular across others that I've also sat on panels with:

Do: Personalise your CV, but within reason, and also try and check what's acceptable. We receive photos with CVs. We have to immediately remove these as we're not allowed to make any choices before interview based on the person's appearance. I know that this is quite popular on the continent, but check to see if this is a problem. Got a degree and some experience? Great. We're not terribly interested in your GCSE results now. No need to list them all, one line at a time. 
Keep is to two pages. No more! 
Don't: Use lots of colours, use bizarre fonts (Comic Sans and you're straight in the bin). Also, check your e-mail address. hunglikeahorse83@hotmail.com? Be professional.

Learn something about the place you're applying for. I actively try and catch people that are scatter-gun applying for everything. When I ring up to offer an interview, I ask *then* something about the place I work at. You'll need to have done your research at that point. I will try and catch you out and I will remember that at interview. 

Interview itself: Read the wikipedia pages (if available); read the website, get an idea of what the organisation does. You don't need to know it inside out, but my God it sets you miles above some candidates. Actually turn up, on time, wearing something approaching clothes. This also sets you above some candidates. Be confident, but not arrogant. Be relaxed. 

Know what you're about. 

It's entirely likely that you'll get an aptitude test. I try and set these so that they really give you something to think about - it won't be an MCQ or somesuch. There won't necessarily be an obvious answer. 

I'm happy to answer any questions if anyone has any...

Quick edit: The position I'm in now, I was headhunted from elsewhere within the organisation. I'm happy to provide proof if required (ideally to a mod, IAmA style?) but earnings are significantly above the national average.

true,SirSeuss,uk,Luton,"My situation doesn't make for fun viewing and it's my first time posting about it so bare with me. I left college two years ago and have been unemployed since. My last year at college I finished the year with about 35% attendance due to my ever worsening social anxiety issues. I was signed on to JSA for about 6 months after college and applied to various jobs and in that six months I only got about 5 interviews, all of which I totally messed up, stuttered, went bright red in the face and just perspired until they said we were done. I actually became used to getting rejected and it didn't bother me. After about 6 months of getting JSA I got my weeks mixed up and basically have been off JSA since. I wanted to call up and say that I missed it and I sort it out but I couldn't bring myself to - I'm terrified of speaking on the phone. So the next 6 months pass and I am basically just a layabout at home. I do nothing productive, I eat unhealthily and get quite unfit. I also had a very terrible sleep pattern and would wake up at 1pm and half the day would be gone. 

Eventually (after 6 months or so) my mother, who is generally quite passive and doesn't poke her nose into my life, gets my to come around and they both try to talk to me about what's going on because they think I'm depressed. I say that I'm not depressed but my mum said she'll make a doctors appointment for me and I went to the doctors and he said I was depressed and offered me either anti-depressants or the chance to go to counselling. I chose counselling because I though it would be good for me, get me out the house and get to talk to someone about something. The first session was quite good and I left feeling good about it. The second one wasn't that good, she asked a lot about my childhood which for some reason irked me - I think because it's a normal childhood and I didn't find it relevant at all. Then the following week I woke up late and missed my appointment with the counsellor, and my phone rang shortly after and I knew it was the counsellor finding out why I wasn't there but I couldn't bring myself to answer it. So I fell into another little slump. I fell into the same repetitive routine, sleeping late and doing nothing. 

Then one week my dad, who is a practice manager at a GP's, said that he had arranged for me to come and work in the office with him for a week doing basic administration work so for just one week I worked there and woke up at 6am and worked 7am-4pm every day and it actually did me a world of good. Suddenly my sleep pattern was decent again, I also started running a few times a week to try to get fit again. This is basically where I am right now. I really want to push on and keep improving. I am slowly making improvements and I want to go to the doctor and get help with my social anxiety but for the past two weeks I've been trying to get myself to make a doctors appointment but I can't bring myself to use the phone yet. I've written up a fresh CV but haven't applied anywhere yet, I want to wait until I'm right in the head. I still lack a lot of confidence and get depressed about not having an direction in life sometimes but I'm better than I was. I've also lost lots of friends over the past two years. The thing I'm most worried about is the Jobcentre and how they'll treat me after 18 months of not signing on and doing nothing and I will inevitably get a lot of rejections and I worry about how it will effect me. So that's my story.

After a year or so I decided to move to somewhere with more techy jobs and found my employer had offices there dealing with ecommerce, my manager was supportive and got in touch with them and got me an interview for a tech support role.

Worked there a few years and developed a good reputation and ended up applying internally and getting a software engineer position in the same company, finally where I wanted to be (and with ~5 years continuous employment under my belt for redundancy security!)

&gt; In November 2000, ABU HAMZA requested that a co-conspirator (“CC-2”) escort another co-conspirator in London (“CC-3”) to a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. ABU HAMZA introduced CC-2 to another co-conspirator (“CC-4”) in order to facilitate safe passage and transportation to Afghanistan, including via safehouses and other lodging in Pakistan. Thereafter, CC-2 and CC-3 traveled from London to Pakistan. CC-2 and CC-3 then separately entered Afghanistan. In March or April 2001, ABU HAMZA conveyed instructions for CC-3 to contact a commander of the terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, who was expecting CC-3. Additionally, from the spring of 2000 through late 2001, ABU HAMZA provided goods and services to the Taliban by, among other things, urging his followers to donate money, goods and services to Taliban-sponsored programs in Afghanistan.

I would put a drop of a color on an index card covered in duct tape (yes, this whole thing was rather ghetto) so I could use as thin a layer as possible of each color. Using a tiny bit of the wrap I dabbed a color (usually started with silver or white) in a small area on my nail, where I wanted the nebula to be. Then I'd dab on more color in tiny amounts (I used different colors on each nail but in all, purple, blue, yellow, pink). Play around with it, see what you like and what works, usually I'd just add white to a dark color and then apply different shades, dark to light, with just a blended spot of white where I wanted the center of the nebula to be. Once that was done I dabbed glitter on...big sparkles look coolest, use it sparingly so it doesn't cover the nebula area. At the very end I took a thumb tack (I'm a professional clearly) and made the tiniest dots known to man kind on each nail and then some larger ones. Once all that dries, put a clear coat over the top because the sponging makes the nail not shiny. 

As for the tardis, I decided it was a good idea to do it with my off-hand. I used blue for the base and then white to make the windows with a thumb tack (using a pointillism-esque technique). Once that was dry enough I used the thumb tack to apply the appropriate black.

true,LightningGeek,eng-staffordshire,Wolves,"I'm 24, left university just over a year ago and only managed to have two jobs in that time. Neither have been to do with my degree (History &amp; English) and both jobs have been more of a stop gap while I try and get into the forces. Especially as a job is infinitely less depressing than having to go to a job seekers meeting.

The first was Christmas last year for the Royal Mail. Despite the pay problems, which will be sorted this year (agency last year who were shite, back to being paid directly by RM), they were pretty decent to work for. 6am till 2pm shifts every day for 4 weeks at minimum wage (£6.08 per hour at that point.)

I'm now working at a document scanning company. Again was only temporary to start with, and I started midway through the exam period with an 8 week/till we had completed the exam scanning, contract. Got lucky and have been kept on. Even been given a chance at a slight promotion (more responsibility but possibly no extra pay) ahead of a couple of guys who have been there longer.

Can't really offer tips on how to get a job other than dress smartly, even for group/casual interviews, ask questions and don't act like an idiot. As for keeping a job/getting promotion offers, just make it look like you're a hard worker. If you have nothing to do, make it look like you are busy, or go ask if you boss/section leader needs anything done. Yes it will make you look like a suck up, but it'll at least keep you busy and help the day go by quicker, as well as giving you a good name when it comes to keeping temps on/when there might be a promotion in the works.",0,1349819249,null,0,false,0,c6k2jtp,t3_117fwc,t1_c6k2jtp,t3_117fwc,null,1430106286,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
