true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; The default position of a fair number of UK Redditors is to disbelieve, discount or discredit anything protesters claim, and to defend the police. Some scepticism is fine, I understand that, but I think it goes beyond that in this sub at times.

In all fairness, protesters claim a lot of things that turn out to be incorrect, poorly interpreted etc all the way through to complete lies. There is also a tendency to report something like a cop pushing someone out of the way (who is repeatedly yelling in their face) as a brutal assault on a totally peaceful protester, and a misunderstanding about the level of force they can use. After all, if they try and arrest you, and you fight back they can punch you and no laws will have been broken. So at least some of it is probably apathy when it comes to watching the right-on-man crowd crying wolf every chance they can, and we all know how that story ended.

&gt; Not my point, believe what you like, and I am not referring to you specifically, and my comment about this thread was more of a throwaway really. Just saying that DBs point, about the default beliefs of the ruling elite and their supporters is very much still the case. I has reduced slightly in recent years, I can't find it now but have seen stats showing trust in the police has declined in recent years, but it is still very high.

For the most part the police can be trusted by most people, if you've had your house broken into you can generally trust the police to turn up, collect evidence and make a stab at catching whoever did it. Same if your mugged, your lost, or someone steals from your shop. And for the majority of people the only time they will come into hostile contact with the police is if they get pulled for speeding, or are being drunk and slightly disorderly. And the police do take a lot of shit from society, be it from passive aggressive neighbors moaning about each other though to repeat offenders who are constantly committing low level crime yet never seem to be dealt with by the justice system.

Then there is the Met. They aren't the same as the rest of the countries police forces and I struggle to think of a big police scandal which hasn't involved the Met over the last few decades. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with the Met but if I had my way the force would be split up into a few different forces, the top 3 layers of management would be put under review and the national policing role they have would be rolled into SOCA.",0,1332114750,null,0,false,0,c42eslt,t3_r1d1j,t1_c42eslt,t1_c42eid1,null,1428549742,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Anyway, I think you're basically right. There's those stupid cases like that one a couple of years ago when a guy tweeted that he was so frustrated with an airport that he was going to blow it up. I think to any sensible person it should be obvious that no harm was intended nor done. Sure, you can't trust the police to be sensible, but I would have thought the judge would have dismissed the case immediately. But, in a decision that still defies belief, he was not only convicted but also [lost his appeal](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/nov/11/twitter-joke-trial-appeal-verdict).

That's a bullshit ruling if ever I've seen one. Who did the judge think she was protecting? What harm was being done? Any idiot could see it was a joke, yet the judge chose to punish him anyway. The only reason I can imagine for that is that the judge decided that she did not like that sort of thing being joked about.

&gt;That is why no amount of cajolery, and no attempts at ethical or social seduction, can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for the Tory Party that inflicted those bitter experiences on me. So far as I am concerned they are lower than vermin. They condemned millions of first-class people to semi-starvation. Now the Tories are pouring out money in propaganda of all sorts and are hoping by this organised sustained mass suggestion to eradicate from our minds all memory of what we went through. But, I warn you young men and women, do not listen to what they are saying now. Do not listen to the seductions of Lord Woolton. He is a very good salesman. If you are selling shoddy stuff you have to be a good salesman. But I warn you they have not changed, or if they have they are slightly worse than they were.

Bevin, 1948.

&gt;If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn you. I warn you that you will have pain – when healing and relief depend upon payment. I warn you that you will have ignorance – when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right. I warn you that you will have poverty – when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won’t pay in an economy that can't pay. I warn you that you will be cold – when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don't notice and the poor can't afford.
&gt;I warn you that you must not expect work – when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don't earn, they don't spend. When they don't spend, work dies. I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light. I warn you that you will be quiet – when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient. I warn you that you will have defence of a sort – with a risk and at a price that passes all understanding. I warn you that you will be home-bound – when fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up. I warn you that you will borrow less – when credit, loans, mortgages and easy payments are refused to people on your melting income.
&gt;If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday, I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to get old.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"I'm fully in agreement with you over the bill being rushed- that's why I instinctively think that it is not good policy. There will need to be changes in the NHS as the UK's demographic shifts, and as different health issues come to the fore, but you're right, the urgency of this bill seems misplaced at best.

I think you also have a point regarding the implications of allowing private treatment of NHS patients, as it does not follow that the private sector will always be more efficient. However haven't Treatment Centres also been regarded to have had a positive effect on the NHS as a whole? There is an interesting, if anecdotal, consideration on the effect of Milburn's Blairite reforms of the NHS market (passing over treatment centres) in the BMJ a couple of years back, which contests that treatment centres had a massive effect as units, but had a highly positive effect systemically: http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7526/1193.extract 

Another argument posited regarding opposition to *those* reforms is that (obviously) NHS staff have a vested interest in protecting their own positions and job-sphere from private-sector provision and efficiencies, which could go some way to explaining the high level of union and staff activity against the bill. Again, the Guardian wrote an article a while ago about how 'anti-privatisation' groups were damaging what could have been a positive step for the NHS: http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/dec/02/private-companies-delivering-nhs-treatment

I completely agree with you that this legislation is going through too fast- that is why I feel that the government should drop it, although now I doubt they will as if the coalition were to stage this climbdown, they'd be sunk in 2015. That being said, I also think that it is their fear of losing the next election that has sparked this rapid attempt at legislation and reform.

My reservations for the opposition to the bill consist of the fact that I feel that people have not considered the good of the NHS or the country, but the political expediency of giving the Tories a kicking. The fact that most of this reform is an extension of Milburn's and Blair's ideas for the NHS 5 years ago, when nobody raised a fuss, reminds me of the student fees thing- where even though Labour introduced them, and promised (like the Tories) to fully implement the findings of the Browne report (which the coalition did, and as Labour would have), most people kept quiet, but when it is the 'nasty party' they get up in arms without considering effective policy. I feel that it is behaviour like that that encourages both parties to formulate bad policy, which we can see in action now and as we saw too with different policies under Labour, in order to satisfy the loudest and least willing to engage, rather than the true needs of our public services and civil society.",0,1332120641,null,0,false,0,c42fug3,t3_r1xcf,t1_c42fug3,t1_c42eg42,null,1428550225,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JimYamato,davison,Davison,"The previous post exactly. The problem is we experience the season linearly along with Amy and Rory up until the Doctor drops them off after The God Complex. We then travel with the Doctor linearly. This Doctor is the one catching up to the older Doctor in the first episode. After dropping off Amy and Rory with a new house and car, he decides to check in on his old flatmate Craig in Closing Time. Craig gives him a big vote of confidence, specifically in that for him, the safest place to be in the face of amazing terror and uncertainty is at the Doctor's side. Plus he sees that Amy and Rory have moved on and are thriving. Before he leaves, Craig gives him the Stetson. At the start of the next episode, he's going all over the place searching for information on the Silence and how to deal with them and why they want him to die so badly they would do the things they do, kidnapping, murder, etc. Soon he realizes he's reaching the point where the timeline records his death in Utah. He refuses to go until he makes a call for his old pal Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. (This tribute got to me.) Upon finding out his old friend had finally passed, the Doctor decides to go to Utah. He meets the Tesselecta crew so they can deliver the envelopes without his crossing his own timeline and he goes to Utah. 

I hope that helps?

&gt;THE REALITY CHECK–LIST 
 
&gt;Anti-Tampering – Powers to make changes more difficult to the engine and drive train of motorcycles
 
&gt;Myth busting reality:
It will not be illegal to change components on a motorcycle
There will not be spot checks of motorcycles on the road
It will only apply to new motorcycles
 
&gt;ABS - Commission wants powers to specify minimum safety equipment for motorcycles including mandatory ABS on larger bikes or CBS on smaller bikes as well as Automatic Headlights On (AHO) on all bikes
 
&gt;Myth busting reality:
Original text excludes enduro and trail bikes
Off switch probably up to manufacturer discretion
AHO already on nearly all bikes sold in EU
 
&gt;On Board Diagnostics (OBD) - will be compulsory in two stages OBD 1 and 2
 
&gt;Myth busting reality:
Not an onboard tracking device – only shows component failure or component out of tolerance
Will not stop bike working
 
&gt;Emissions - Bring pollutant limits for bikes in line with cars in three stages over the next decade. Bikes must remain compliant for 50,000km (less for smaller bikes)
 
&gt;Myth busting reality:
Bikes release a much higher amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons than cars
Catalytic converters can be fitted to motorcycles and routinely are
Bikes over 7 years old will not be banned from entering town centres
 
&gt;Measures Outside of Type Approval
 
&gt;There is nothing in the proposed regulation on the wearing of compulsory high visibility clothing; town centre bans for old motorcycles; power limits or European wide MOTs. Some other EU countries have proposed such things, but not the EU and they are not being proposed in the UK either says the BMF.

true,sealiontamer,null,null,"Season 3 is not as good as seasons 1 or 2. It simply isn't. Nathan's exit left a huge void in the show, and while the writers have found a willing replacement in newbie Joseph Gilgun, it's just not the same — I really wish they'd taken his character a bit further away from Nathan so he'd seem less like ""Nathan II"". Also, after two seasons, we know our characters and setting and the tone of the show has long been established. It's going to take a great plot to keep us hooked — the initial novelty has worn off a bit. 

Sadly, this season has barely touched on the Future Simon storyline (which also means less Alicia and you know, boo for that) so ""what may be a plot hole"" might also still be explained at some point. People will have to wait to see exactly where that arc goes, and prepare for ""the season of Kelly, Curtis, and New Guy"" (plus the power-dealer guy). If you love Kelly, you're going to love season 3.

That said, season 3 is worth a watch. The introduction of ""power-switchin"" in season 2 was a great one (long term) because it allows our heroes to experience/use/adjust to new powers, opening up new story possibilities. Season 3 contains some really memorable and well-done episodes, particularly a time-travelling story involving Nazi Germany. On the whole, the season felt a bit uneven and struggling to recover from Robert Sheehan's departure, but really picked up towards the end after the new subplot has fully formed to pay off a bit of foreshadowing in seasons 2 and 3.

**TL;DR: Watch it. There's only 8 episodes, and they lead me to believe Season 4 might be pretty excellent. Why stop now!?**

As for how it's held up and the engine heat questions. It was done about 2 years ago (it'll be 2 this summer I think), and it's gone through 2 Wisconsin winters (2010/2011 and 2011/2012). The only imperfections I've noticed is a small chip/crack in one part, and I'm not sure what could have done it but I'm sure it won't be too difficult to fix (probably just another coat should do it I would think). 

The engine heat doesn't much seem to affect how long/well it holds - it all seems to come off pretty easily. That being said, the best way to clean it up would probably be to just hose it down without using too much pressure - I wiped some small things away with a rag and it resulted in paint transfer to the rag (though I'm sure some shout or spray and wash or bleach would take care of it), and once the water dries up when using a rag, it leaves a slight residue behind.

true,LimeGreenFwooper,eccleston,Eccleston,"&gt;10 has my favorite personality, but I love 9 in a completely different way. I think in a way, I like 9 and 10 equally but for different reasons. 9 was darker and a bit more ruthless (like when he stands there and watches Cassandra just die with no emotion) which is incredible to watch, but 10 has more of a fun, quirky personality.

I totally agree. I loved the darker personality that Eccleston played and was rather sad to see him go. What I absolutely loved about Eccleston was that you could feel how emotionally hardened he was from the events surrounding the end of the Time War. He dark ruthlessness was what made him a great Doctor but I think it's also what caused him to be more overlooked and underrated because he didn't have much of a softer side to connect with. Now when Tennant became the Doctor, I found him to be silly and rather missed Eccleston. However, his ""No second chances, I'm that sort of a man"" line was an ""okay, now there's some of what Eccleston had"" moment for me. Ultimately, he ended up being my favourite, with Eccleston a close second.

I'm on the fence about Matt Smith. At times he can be witty and clever but he also comes across as more of a self-important asshole than the other two. Like, Eccleston and Tennant were able to command the Doctor Who authority more with their attitude than their words. While Smith is confident as the Doctor, he doesn't have the strength of character to command the DW authority without having to say it. He basically has to say ""Stop talking and listen to me, I'm important,"" whereas Tennant and Eccleston could reflect that in their personality. I also find him more difficult to understand than the other two. He's rather mumbly at times and sometimes I'll have to rewind my episode three or four times to catch what he's said... that rarely happened with Eccleston or Tennant.

Overall, since Smith became the Doctor and Moffat took over writing, the show doesn't seem to be as Doctor Who-y as the previous seasons. While the season-long storyline is interesting, I miss the mini-stories and small adventures... it kept things more dynamic.

Sorry for the small novel... I just watched all 6 seasons in the span of around 1-2 months and no one really IRL to share my opinions with (bf doesn't watch DW).

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"If you want to try classic Who.. 
First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only, reconstructions are in place for the missing episodes).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His era is mostly missing so its hard to get a grip his era. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

Note: If you can find reconstructions that are accompanied by narration then your life gets much easier with them.",0,1332142806,null,0,false,0,c42j7au,t3_r21wc,t1_c42j7au,t3_r21wc,null,1428551945,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

So, you have a service provided at a reasonable price that offers a necessary rate of return for the investor, revenue for the hospital and doesn't ruin the finances of the user.

The value of the service will be proven by whether it is used by customers - or not.

It is worth possibly noting that thanks to medical issues, it is rare for companies to be able to install conventional off-the-shelf hardware into wards/rooms and they will need to buy specialised equipment. That will automatically push up the cost to the user as well.

How many people here discriminate against the religious for their beliefs, quite a lot of you, 5 minutes on reddit proves that.

Gay marriage should be legal, but the church should be able to refuse performing the ceremony, would an atheist group allow religious extremists to join? Atheists speak out against religious people ALL THE TIME, but this is seen as fun nd acceptable, because atheists think they are right and think religion is wrong, this might be true, it might not, but as soon as a Christian speaks out about anything the are shot down, how is that equality? Atheists treat the religious like the religious treat homosexuals, I just wish everyone could see the hypocrisy here.

again so I'm not misquoted, I am not religious, I have no problem with homo sexuals, I believe gay marriage should be perfectly legal, but that doesn't mean the Church has to let it happen in its walls if it doesn't want to.

And here I will surprise you and ... agree. It's obviously something that isn't that rare (as in it's seen in all countries), and it's certainly not something that anyone would choose.

However, whilst I would argue that it's a natural phenomenon it certainly can't be allowed to happen because it causes harm to others (innocent ones at that).

So let's put aside the kneejerk fire-and-pitchfork reunion for a moment and consider the actual facts of this plan.

1. This will only cover A roads and motorways, so you can rest assured you won't be charged to get out of your driveway.
2. Tolls will **NOT** be placed on existing roads. Tolls on *upgraded* roads is a matter of contention.
3. The contractor will recieve cash from the treasury annually to pay for the maintenance of the road networks, under the eye of an independent regulator (hey guys, it's that word 'regulation' that you love so much!)

So how will the contractors benefit from all this? They're not allowed to toll existing roads, so all they can do is build new ones and toll them instead. New roads that would either never get built under government supervision or take twenty years and billions of pounds. The current road infrastructure, compared to the rest of Europe, is a national embarrassment. It takes over two hours to drive the quickest route from Swansea to Aberystwyth, just 75 miles, the vast majority being along winding countryside B roads with potholes and signs warning about the number of casualties claimed by it over the last ten years (due to its shitty, 100 year old design). The M25 is one giant clusterfuck where the only time that isn't guaranteed to make you late is between 2-4am. What the hell is with that?

Compare this to the situation in France where you could drive from one end of the country to the other before it gets dark, or the fact that they built tunnels *through* the goddamn Alps to get you through there without embarking on some winding World Rally Championship journey around the peaks.

The fact is, guys, that if you want a half way decent road network that isn't the complete shit-steak we have now, somebody is going to have to pay for it, and neither this government nor the next is going to want to to shell out money on a redevelopment that will be in construction for the whole of their tenure at Number 10 at least four times over.

I have a better solution.  Move the entire civil service out of London - all of it. 

MPs can use video conferencing to talk to their departments.

In the economically poorer areas you can recruit a higher calibre civil servant due to the lack of jobs. You also save all that London weight pay, and expensive office buildings.

Kenny even says in the article that they have always had special dispensation from the FA and UEFA, I doubt that will change now.

Taken from the Echo:

&gt;Dalglish also confirmed that he expects the semi-final to be played on Saturday April 14, so as to avoid a clash with the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, which falls a day later.
&gt;
&gt;He said: “We won’t be playing on the 15th. The FA and UEFA have always been exemplary and very supportive with regards to Hillsborough, so I don’t think it is even worth suggesting that we might play on the 15th because we won’t.”

And for every £2 over £100k you earn, you lose £1 of your tax free allowance. You end up paying 60% tax, and closer to 70% if you consider NI a tax.


If you have income of £100,000 you'll be taxed as:

- Income £100,000
- Personal allowance -£7,475
- Taxable income £92,525 
- Basic rate tax £35,000 @ 20% = £7,000
- Higher rate tax £57,525 @ 40% = £23,010

Total tax payable = £30,010

Now compare this with someone who earns £115,000.

They'll pay tax of:

- Taxable income (no personal allowance) £115,000
- Basic rate tax £35,000 @ 20% = £7,000
- Higher rate tax £80,000 @ 40% = £32,000

Regardless, before contract negotiations even begin, business proposals are written up and submitted from multiple companies which will note in detail their plans for the road network and the prospective costs of these plans. Once a company is chosen (after a lengthy decision process), further plans are written up and funding will be negotiated as part of the contract. 

Clauses for requests for increases in funding may be put in but will have a limit, and at this point it's the government/DoT's responsibility to negotiate or put the contract back out to tender if they feel they've had a bum deal. If the contractor suddenly demands more money as you say, they should have agreed better terms. Besides, contractors won't start work on a new road unless they have secured the funding, so you won't end up with cancelled contracts and half-finished roads unless a serious fuckup occurs.

Religions also have sets of rules. One rule followed by many religions is that homosexual couples cannot marry within the church.

Yes, of course. I wasn't trying to say that it was 60%+ on all earnings.

What it does, though, is make it almost worthless to bother earning over £100k unless you are going to earn significantly over £100k. What many people do who earn £100k-£125k is ask their employer not to pay them the money over £100k (sacrifice the salary) and instead get the employer to deposit the money into a pension fund on their behalf, which doesn't attract tax. The government loses tax revenue, nullifying the point of the tax free allowance tapering.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The 40% tax rate is relatively new, though - it was only dropped to 40% in 1988 under Thatcher. Prior to that, the rate was 60%, and about ten years before that it was _83%_. Complain all you like, and I'm sure companies aren't happy about it, but 40% as a top tax bracket is historically very low, it's just that Geneva is lower.

In addition to that, the 50% tax rate is a _personal_ tax - it's a stimulus for individuals to move to other countries, not for companies. Minor issue, but regardless, income tax doesn't affect businesses, it affects individuals. If those individuals are so offended by paying a small amount more tax that they decide to actually move their firm out of [one of the top two financial centres of the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre), then that's their business.

As a simple example, comparing how much more you'd pay under the 50% bracket than you did under the 40% bracket:

Income|Extra tax paid
:---|:---
£150,000|£0.00
£200,000|£5,000
£300,000|£15,000
£500,000|£35,000
£1,000,000|£85,000

Now, it might seem like that's a lot to pay, if you make a million pounds a year. By my reckoning, if you made £1,000,000 in a year, you'd take home £523,969. ""What a rip-off,"" you cry! Well, perhaps. Previously you'd have earned £608,969 - a bit more. Honestly, though, what would you have done with it? What difference is that going to make to your quality of life? [The average income in the UK, depending on how you measure it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8151355.stm), is between £20,000 and £30,000, so forgive me for lacking sympathy. Personally, I like having a well-funded NHS and a good education system, but as an individual earning £20,000 a year, I don't have much that I can contribute to that.

Maybe it's just because I'm in a relatively low income bracket, but I have very little sympathy for those who earn more than £150,000 complaining that their tax has gone up by a few thousand a year. I'm lucky enough to be able to live comfortably on £20,000, as a single young man, but thousands have to support families on salaries not much higher, and in many cases lower than mine. I guess there's no real way to see if I'd stick to my guns should I move up the tax brackets, but I sure as hell plan to.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"In British Gas, the government made a lot of money selling that off. The subsequent opening of competition means that although Gas and Electricity is more expensive it's still possible to get electricity and gas for cheaper than solely from British Gas.

The privatisation of National Express means that you only pay for the buses you use, when you use them. You're still free to drive to where you want to go, take reasonable shorter distance buses, take the train, cycle, walk or use other long distance coach companies. If National Express were still publicly owned it would be publicly funded whether you use it or not.

British Coal was dying long before privatisation, and bringing that to the private sector was bad for people who had jobs there, especially when it was asset stripped. Still, in many respects it was good to cut the losses as the reason it was asset stripped was because a large part of it was unprofitable. I don't mean there was a large predatory profit making part, I mean there were large swathes of the business dragging down the rest.

British Energy's privatisation brought cash into the treasury and had a similar effect in terms of power generation to the British Gas. At the moment BE is part owned by EDF and Centrica (who own British Gas).

Consignia was a wholly state owned plc that handled letter delivery, parcel delivery and post office management. The creation of a wholly state owned plc gives governments the opportunity to maintain control of divisions of the company with commercial freedom to enable competition in the market while letting the government raise funds through rights issues if needed. Eventually Consignia became Royal Mail Group.

Of the lot above, British Coal and British Energy have the biggest impact. There's no doubt that British Coal's privatisation and subsequent asset stripping cost jobs and caused problems, but the government of the day would've been effectively forced into either paying people to dig holes and fill them in, or losing those jobs anyway. With British Energy we've effectively had a brain drain for years when it comes to nuclear, whereas EDF have a huge amount of experience in the field. The investment in maintaining and building new power stations will largely be driven through EDF as put simply, we lack the ability to build new nuclear power stations ourselves.

So long as you have extremely concentrated economic power (as a result of privately owned land, resources, factories, etc.) then you will have concentrated political power - as they can finance their own media, election campaigns, etc.

And even if you did somehow avoid this political corruption, what use is the government when all of the resources and services are privately owned? What could the government even do? They are crushed under the iron heel of the capitalists, who can always threaten to pull out their resources and move the jobs to other countries which will follow their demands. There's no greater example of this than in Greece, where the government doesn't even pretend to have any sovereignty anymore.

Democracy is dead because it was never alive. It must be economic as well as political.

To quote Lenin:

&gt;Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slave-owners. Owing to the conditions of capitalist exploitation, the modern wage slaves are so crushed by want and poverty that ""they cannot be bothered with democracy"", ""cannot be bothered with politics""; in the ordinary, peaceful course of events, the majority of the population is debarred from participation in public and political life.

And Einstein:

&gt;Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.",0,1332173312,null,0,false,0,c42mea0,t3_r3hzd,t1_c42mea0,t3_r3hzd,null,1428553463,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I believe some services must remain nationalised as to benefit society in the whole. So what if some of us where paying a few extra pennies from our taxes to fund bus journeys for the less fortunate in society? I'd rather pay that, then let low income earners suffer.

On regards to British Coal, why is it then that thru the choice of government that so many people where laid off in areas of the country which was primarily a mining town, yet the government did little to nothing to help these people pick up there life's?  If you are going to action state level adjustments, then the people who are directly affected should be the very first consideration since they're paying taxes too.

How is it cheaper sorry? A nationalised system allows for all profits to be re-injected into society, not a few peoples pockets. Now as a nation we are paying more money into this privatised system because of the energy allowance for the older generation, surely thats more expensive and they money is being lost to private firms, not being injected into society. 

In conclusion, my major problem with all this is that the government is submitting to corperations for all essentials services which will only become more expensive because the current economical model strifes for ever increasing profits, not for necessity of society.

The other thing that affects investor confidence is government stability. The reason that so many investors support right wing governments is that they know their money will be safeguarded and this encourages them to invest. If you are worried the government might raise tax by 40% half way through an investment, it is a risk that needs to be considered.   

Well, yes they like it or lump it but we need them to like it and use it or the economy will shrink. The options for investors are not restricted to dividend paying businesses, they can invest their money in anything they choose anywhere in the world or just hold the cash if its a safer option.
When a business pays a 5% dividend return on your capital taxing it 50% makes a big difference. An example might be an oil sheik who has 200m fund to invest and is seeking a 4-6% return a year through dividends. Currently he will be taxed 10% of this due to non dom status meaning if his investment returns 5% a year he will get 9m return a year (4.5% total). If he was taxed top rate this would be 5m a year (2.5% total). In this case he would just invest elsewhere where his return would meet his target.

&gt;If you don't know the full extent of Britain's military involvement in the past 20 years 

I take this to mean that you think that you do know the full extent of Britain's military involvement in the last 20 years.  You are utterly delusional if you think this is true, which wouldn't surprise me considering how frivalelously you talk about afghanistan with bobby on the beat and football analogies.  

You seem to be grandstanding over the fact I've told you I don't know about a specific area of a vast landscape of information as evidence that you can talk about it and I can't. 

But I mean, you're trying to conform the entire military history of the UK over the last 20 years into a generally ""good"" or ""bad"" thing, which is such an incredibly ridiculous thing to try to do when you are talking about the same entity that invaded afghanistan in the fact of the predicted deaths of millions.  You are trying to affirm a world view that is so ridiculously simplistic that I struggle how you can even believe it.

What I originally said is that we should feel guilt for the wars in afghanistan and iraq, because as citizens we each hold a responsibility for actions done in our name, what was my point.  If you want to challenge that, do it, but you haven't done it once yet.  Everything about this substanceless conversation could have been avoided if you listened to me when I said that I don't know about Kosovo and so on, and so you should ask someone else.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"There's so much fail here I'm unsure where to start.

&gt; And the social benefits are where? This is all relating to money (somewhat temporary cash too) and greed, nothing more.

There are social benefits in some cases. Not funding people to dig holes in the ground at a loss means that the money put aside for that can be put on other things.

&gt; I believe some services must remain nationalised as to benefit society in the whole.

I agree. I suspect we disagree on the details but in principle I agree. However I'd also say that running things by the state is the least efficient way of doing so, whereas running it by the private sector makes it difficult to balance any social benefits a service may provide with profitability. On the whole I'm more in favour of privatisation and smaller government than larger government and less competition, and I suspect you may hold the opposite view.

&gt; So what if some of us where paying a few extra pennies from our taxes to fund bus journeys for the less fortunate in society?

Are you honestly trying to tell me that a state run bus system would be free at the point of use for low income earners? Does it not make more sense that instead of running a state operated bus system to have the private sector cover all the overheads and just give low income earners bus passes as we do for pensioners?

&gt; On regards to British Coal, why is it then that thru the choice of government that so many people where laid off in areas of the country which was primarily a mining town, yet the government did little to nothing to help these people pick up there life's?

Because, and it may come as some shock to you, the government is largely ineffective at creating jobs. The jobs mainly come from... shock horror... the private sector. In fact, the jobs come almost exclusively from growing businesses (i.e. not big established ones, but new ones founded locally). These mining towns were being artificially kept alive by a resource-driven economy. When the resource became too expensive to pull out of the ground they were shut down and no forethought in terms of investing into an ecosystem that could survive that was considered. Imagine for example, a mining town that makes steel using it's own coal? That then goes on to have engineering firms that build things? That then goes on to have firms that support that manufacturing industry but can exist in their own right? None of that happened because successive governments took the easy way out.

&gt; If you are going to action state level adjustments, then the people who are directly affected should be the very first consideration since they're paying taxes too.

Once they're laid off they're no longer paying taxes, and if they're in a town that doesn't vote the way the government of the day likes they will be fucked. That's why Wales was screwed over so much, the same for Liverpool, Sheffield and the list goes on. However, at no point did the government plan for the inevitable decline of these industries, because it's incapable of doing so, even when you know you only have so much raw material in the ground.

&gt; How is it cheaper sorry?

Are you actually stark raving mad? Go to uswitch.com, put your numbers in and see where British Gas comes up. When it was a state monopoly (the gas board) your uswitch site would've consisted of one option. No-one would work for Powergen, E-on, Scottish Power, EDF in residential power because they wouldn't exist. No-one would work for uswitch dealing with gas because there'd be no choice. There'd be no uswitch if it was all state run. There'd be no quidco either to give people extra cash back on changing as no-one would work there on sorting out gas deals. It's cheaper, you have more choice and when things go wrong you're not stuck with one shitty provider that doesn't care (and this happened with British Gas and British Telecom before privatisation).

&gt; A nationalised system allows for all profits to be re-injected into society, not a few peoples pockets.

No. A nationalised system allows for all profits to be re-injected into the treasury. If you think that the government's interest is providing the best possible Gas prices I have a bridge to sell you. The government should have no interest in the running of residential gas services, boiler support, retail or wholesale banking, betting, parcel delivery, home phone services, credit cards or travel money exchange, yet aside from the first two for some reason it does.

&gt; Now as a nation we are paying more money into this privatised system because of the energy allowance for the older generation

Do you really not think we'd be doing this on a nationalised system? Does a nationalised system mean free energy for all that need it at the point of use? Are you living in the 21st century with $100 a barrel oil?

&gt; In conclusion, my major problem with all this is that the government is submitting to corperations for all essentials services

Wake up and smell the coffee, this has happened since the East India Company was established. The government is an instrument of the Crown, not the people. You are a subject, not a democratically free citizen.

Unlike every other Doctor, Eccleston's seemed the most... human. He felt like a real person with a sense of humor and a set of feelings and just a real mind. He felt like flesh and blood. Not like some oddball genius plot-device but as a real man with a real past that haunts him.

When Nine beamed, you beamed. That smile could just light up a room. And when he got serious, you knew things really were getting serious. In just one season he made an impression greater than most Doctor's manage in several.

And that has a lot to do with Eccleston's capabilities as an actor. If you take a look at his other works he really shows a superb level of just brilliant talent. Frankly I think he's the best actor to take the title, but I know that this isn't the major opinion.

Bottom line: Eccleston was able to sell a 900-year old Time Lord who travels through space and time in a little box as a person you'd really love and want to be around and as a real living being.

The Movie's meant as a pilot for an American TV Show on FOX. It is (technically) the single most watched episode of Doctor Who ever to air (which I find shockingly surprising, seeing as I'd never heard of it) and chronicles the Seventh Doctor carrying the ashes of the Master to Gallefrey when the ashes turn into a snake-thing and send him to L.A. 1999.

The Doctor accidentally exits the TARDIS in the middle of a gang war and is shot to shit. He's brought to a hospital where Dr. Grace Holloway fucks up his hearts and kills him.

Dazed by the anesthetic the Doctor regenerates, but has no idea who he is. Meanwhile the Master finds one of the gang members and gets him to sneak into the TARDIS as ""the TARDIS likes him"" with the intent of opening the Eye of Harmony and doing... something. He also wants to steal the Doctor's lives, as his body is degenerating.

The Doctor teams up with Grace Holloway and they work together to stop the Master before the clock strikes 2000.

You said:

&gt; Infertility is unnatural yes, it doesn't mean they chose to be...

Given the opinions of those against homosexuals, who imply that being gay is sinful etc. I think it's a reasonable area to ask for clarification. Your wording left the option open that you thought homosexuality was a choice. How? I mean ""Where the fuck am I getting that from?"" - because you brought it up, that's where. I made an analogy with ""unnatural"" infertile people (which by the way I don't think is unnatural, seeing as infertility occurs in the animal kingdom too - it's a great way of stopping dodgy genes from spreading) and you then made it clear that you weren't of the opinion that infertility is their fault etc. Why mention ""they don't choose to be that way, are bad people..."" if not to imply gays do/are? I'm not saying you are saying that, you've just told me the opposite, but it's a bloody strange thing to even mention as a possibility. Do any religious groups even say that?! I've never heard anyone (whatever nutter) say that infertile people are 'bad'.

Calm down. I asked whether or not you were saying that, didn't I?

I copied and pasted you saying that infertility wasn't a choice. Meanwhile you're advocating religious people discriminating against homosexuals. If you think there's no possible implication...

&gt; How many people here discriminate against the religious for their beliefs

Oooh because religious beliefs trump equality laws? Bollocks, no. And can you bring up an example of anyone actually discriminating against a religious people in a real world scenario. No, not what someone says on a website which you think demonstrates it, but an actual court case where someone was discriminating. There might be some, but they are really rather rare when compared to racism, sexism etc. (in the work place).

By the by: ""quite a lot of you"" - Us and them? No, thank you. I'm a secularist and my comment history makes that quite clear. I'm an active member of my local secular society and also the NSS. [I attended this on Saturday.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/03/peter-tatchell-named-secularist-of-the-year) My point? Not everyone who campaigns for religious people to treat everyone equally (and vice versa) is discriminating against religious people. In fact quite the reverse.

&gt; Atheists speak out against religious people ALL THE TIME

Hey. Guess what? You have a bias. No really, you do. You're missing a MASSIVE part of the picture here, and not looking at all the facts. Facts like this: [100 Clergy for civil partnerships.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2095251/Nearly-100-clergy-revolt-Church-ban-gay-weddings.html) And facts [like this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8177536.stm). The first isn't gay marriage as such, but it should give you an indication as to how a large number of people feel. The second is to demonstrate that some religious groups want to allow gay marriage, full marriage, and hold ceremonies in their places of worship. The legislation being proposed by the government won't give them that option. Sound fair? Effectively I would say that religious group is being discriminated against.

&gt; the church should be able to refuse performing the ceremony

And so they should be allowed to refuse to marry a black woman and a white man. Why not? Give me a good reason why not, that can't be used to justify gay marriage too. And I'm talking about undermining their religious arguments, not coming at it from a ""Well it's illegal in the UK"" direction.

&gt;  would an atheist group allow religious extremists to join?

Do you not realise that there are gay Christians who want to get married in churches? Do you think it's atheist/non-religious gays who ""want a nice place"" to get hitched? Lots and lots of homosexuals are also religious, and accepted in their churches. Those churches, of which I have a feeling there are many, are happy to marry a gay couple. But aren't being given the option.

As for your opinion that:

&gt; ""this is seen as fun nd acceptable"" 

*Applause* Yes, of course. It's because it's ""hip and trendy"". No, thank you very much. Would you say the same thing if a church was refusing to perform an interracial marriage? That is a *wonderful* analogy, though many people don't agree, but they fail to acknowledge the history of how such relations were dealt with by religious groups. The bible justifies treating black people differently and avoiding interracial marriage. It really does - See such issues in the US in the recent past for full details.

As for the dismissive ""Oh you're rebelling"" idea - You want to correct that, thanks. I've been an atheist my whole life - I don't speak out on issues like this because I want to be popular. To denigrate causes like this in such a way is rather insulting.

&gt; atheists think they are right and think religion is wrong

SECULARISM. SEC. U. LAR. ISM. Do you know what it means? No, really. Do you actually know what secularism means? Because many people don't - the general public agree with secular principles, but the religious right have twisted the word into some kind of ""evil atheist plot"". Ever heard the phrase ""militant secularism""? Of course you have. But it's a terrible misnomer and you seem to have bought into the idea that it's atheists out to get the church. No.

&gt; Atheists treat the religious like the religious treat homosexuals

Bullshit. Absolute and utter bullshit, and it's demonstrative of your own problem with atheists that you would think that any snub by non-believers comes anywhere close to the discrimination gays and lesbians have and still suffer at the hands of religious groups. It's disgusting, in fact. [Find me the atheist, the prominent atheist spokesperson, analogy for this.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556131/Floods-are-judgment-on-society-say-bishops.html). Where are the legislation in the UK that allows institutionalised atheism to discriminate *legally* against religious people *because* of their religion, or lifestyles? Oh wait! It doesn't exist. And yet [it's LAW the other way around](http://www.secularism.org.uk/teacher-discrimination-challenge.html), with some Bishops refusing to alter it. Do you think the 'atheists' were coming from level ground and building mountains against religious people? Christ no. The religious groups are up on the hills with SECULARISTS working to bring them down to the level playing field.

r/atheism does not extend to the real world - you've bought into the propoganda from the religious right, lamenting their loss of privilege as they fight to keep the right to discriminate. If 'atheists' were discriminating against religious people, then SECULARISTS would be there to slap them down. Why? Because secularism calls for anyone and everyone to be treated equally no matter race, religions, sex or sexuality. And more.

&gt; I just wish everyone could see the hypocrisy here.

I just wish everyone would get their facts straight and look at the bigger picture and stop believing the continued lies from the religious right here.

I know you're not a homophobe and I know you're not religious, to be clear. I would imagine you're an atheist, though I have a feeling you don't want that label. I'm going to rewrite something you said, slightly, to try and make you understand the issue:

&gt; again so I'm not misquoted, I am not religious, I have no problem with black people, I believe interracial marriage should be perfectly legal, but that doesn't mean the Church has to let it happen in its walls if it doesn't want to.

See what we're driving at? But even if that analogy weren't possible, there are lots of churches that want to allow the ceremonies. The extreme right, and the hierarchy, don't want to allow them the option. I'm not even saying that churches should be forced to perform the ceremonies - I personally think that they shouldn't be made to, but should have their licences revoked: everyone's a winner! But I still want to make people understand the bigotry involved.

""like normal British couples"" - No, I was putting in my own quotation marks to demonstrate that if you were campaigning against such people then you'd be implying they weren't 'the same' as the rest of us.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Typical science really, if it can't be understood by scientists then it has no validity

Something that is repeatable, and comes up with the same results is valid. That is what science is. Homeopathy is not repeatable therefore not valid. See it doesn't take much to understand it. 

&gt;The thing which sticks in scientist's craw about homeopathy is that it works, more so than the placebo effect, but not by much though.

Actually the thing that really baffles us is why the NHS spend 4 million a year on it while subjecting patients to a postcode lottery when it comes to getting medicine that is not on the NICE recommended list. 

**Homeopathy works by placebo effect, nothing more nothing less.** There is no triggering the bodies own healing, or anything such like.  

&gt;They reject it as they do not have the mental template to understand it, that is their problem, not homeopathy's.

Actually we reject it because it is bollocks. You know all the plants and herbs used in homeopathy? Well the stuff that was used for hundreds of years, got tested and became the basis for the medicine we use today. Pharma companies are always looking into the plant world for new compounds with novel biological activities. The reason they haven't taken homeopathy on board is that it **doesn't fucking work.** Maybe the 'mental template' of those proponents of homeopathy is what keeps it a flourishing business. 

The place for homeopathy is on the shelves at Boots, or in private homeopathy businesses, not in the NHS.

""Wars waged in the last few decades"" 1990-2012. Gulf war, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan

""that is something that I personally feel guilty about and I think it's justified""- This suggests you think it is justified to feel guilty FOR ALL THE WARS named above.

Add those three together and you can understand where the general guilt came from.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;However haven't Treatment Centres also been regarded to have had a positive effect on the NHS as a whole? 

No. The ISTCs took easy operations and their funding away from the NHS hospitals, which made the NHS hospitals less viable. They also  compromised the training of doctors. [This is why Norman Tebbit thinks they are a bad thing.](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/norman-tebbit-savages-david-camerons-119665)

Our local NHS trust recently brought their ISTC back in house when the contract expired. 

I haven't got a BMJ subscription so I couldn't rad the paper you posted.

&gt;Another argument posited regarding opposition to those reforms is that (obviously) NHS staff have a vested interest in protecting their own positions and job-sphere from private-sector provision and efficiencies, which could go some way to explaining the high level of union and staff activity against the bill. 

The GPs have been offered a 25% payrise if the  bill passes. There would be winners as well as losers. 

I've worked in the private sector for too long to put ""private sector"" and ""efficiency"" in the same sentence. The bigger the organisation, the less efficient it usually is. This is why I think decentralisation might have more mileage than privatisation.

&gt;The fact that most of this reform is an extension of Milburn's and Blair's ideas for the NHS 5 years ago, when nobody raised a fuss, reminds me of the student fees thing- where even though Labour introduced them, and promised (like the Tories) to fully implement the findings of the Browne report (which the coalition did, and as Labour would have), most people kept quiet, but when it is the 'nasty party' they get up in arms without considering effective policy.

Certainly the media  has an axe to grind. The Guardian didn't object nearly as loudly to private sector provision when it was a Labour policy, while nearly all the rest of the media took the opposite view. With the exception of the Daily Telegraph, which has roundly slated the bill.

For myself I'm probably some sort of social democrat. I want to see well funded public services. I'd prefer to see these services delivered by the public sector, but in the end if the private sector could do a better job so be it. Pragmatism FTW!

2. About the church, if you work for the church and think gay marragie should be accepted in church, then obviously you need a new job, if a police officer decided heroin should be legal all of a sudden the police won't change the law, just as the church don't need to chage the rules they've had for thousand of years.

If the church deiced not to marry black people....its their business, it doesn't matter if it goes against popular opinion, it doesn't matter if its unfair, if they aren't hurting anyone then they have every right to make their own rules as much as that seems to pain everyone.

3. I say this and I mean it, no word play, if you are gay and want to be married in chruch, then you're an idiot, you knew the rules of christianity, they are thousands of years old, if you are gay and decide to be part of a religion that actively hates you, then you're an idiot, even if your own church accepts you, the book you live your life by says you're wrong, so either accept you aren't allowed to be married in chuch or leave religion behind.

4. I've already covered interacial marraige, popular opinion and morality doesn't mean the church should have to change it's rules, again if interacial marraige  and homo sexual marrrage where treated the same and you where part of an inter racial couple who wanted to get married in a church, what are you thinking? you knew the rules, if something says black tie only and i turn up in tshirt and jeans they won't let me in, it shouldn't matter what I look like or what I'm wearing but unfortunately for me, rules are rules, I knew the rules and decided not to listen, it doesn't mean the people planning the even need to change their rules, if i bought 5'000'000 signatures saying I should bne allowed in with tshirt and jeans, it doesn't mean they have to let me in.

5. I don't ask people about religion in real life because I don't give a shit it, but as far as here on reddit is concerned, atheists are right, religion is wrong, and the bulk of atheist posts that occur on here are out attacking the church or it's people.
I answered a question on reddit, in the context of reddit, what gays, religious people and atheits do and say in the real world is their business.


I don't even know if any of this is making a point so ill just have to summerise my opinion again.

As long as the church isn't harming anyone it can have what ever bat shit crazy rules it wants simple as. If members of the church don't like it, then they'll have to leave because the rules aren't going to change any time soon. Does it mean its right? Nope, does it mean people have to like it? Nope, it doesn't mean they have to change. Interacial marraige, gay marriage, christening people called Oliver, not play D chords on a organ on Wednesday, its their religion, their beliefs, their rules, simple as unfortunately.

[spoiler](/s ""I'm assuming you got as far as knowing there's 2 universes and they've visited each other. Blue Olivia was captured and detained in the Other Side while Red Olivia was infiltrating our world. She got pregnant with Peter's child while she was here. Both Olivia managed to get back to their respective universes. Blue Olivia was emotionally very hurt by Peter ""cheating"" on her, even though she mentally understood that's not what it was to him. Eventually they worked it out, but this is why Peter at present is so hesitant to do anything with this ""Yellow"" Olivia, out of fear of hurting ""his"" Olivia."")  

[spoiler](/s ""While Red Olivia was here, she was trying to collect the last piece of ""The Machine"", a gigantic device whose origin and purpose were unknown and thought to potentially be a weapon capable of destroying universes. Both sides had discovered that the machine responded to Peter and Peter only. On the Other Side, Walternate took blood from Olivia's Baby, Henry, in order to single out genes inherited from Peter in an attempt to be able to wield the machine's power with the partial DNA. Meanwhile, in some serious mind-bending mental time-travel sort of scenario, Peter looked some 20 odd years into the future and saw that the war between the two universes had ruined them both. The Machine was actually created by him and Walter to *heal* the universes, some 20 years in the future, and they sent it back through time so that they, their younger selves, could discover it and use it to fix things. Peter awakens from his vision and uses the machine to create a permanent bridge between the two universes so that they can work together to fix them."")  

[spoiler](/s ""Immediately after doing so (and explaining such to involved parties in both universes), Peter disappeared. Whether a direct result of his bridging the universes, or interference from the Observers is unknown. Nobody recalled Peter, but somehow the scenario where the bridge existed still made sense to everyone. History had been rewritten so that many things were much the same, minus Peter. This is the ""Yellow timeline"". Peter, to the Observers' befuddlement, managed to resurface back into existence. The Fringe team in the Blue verse was originally very suspicious of Peter, but now sympathetic to him and trying to help him get home to his timeline/universe. Yellow Olivia, though, started to ""slip"" and knew things that only Red Olivia should know and started to act like her. Eventually, she had full out memories and emotions that she shouldn't have."")

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans along. We've had approximately 780 episodes but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in anywhere. 

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a person will like.
Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 then relaunched in 2005. 

By no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

* Anecdotally I'd say it rains a lot. April/May/June are normally the best months of the year and then July/August are a mixture of hot one day, rainy the next.

* Coverage of the royal family doesn't really intrude on your life. It might get mentioned on the news, but no more than Kim Kardashian might get mentioned in the US. Just ignore it if it bothers you.

* Job market is pretty weak at the moment. No idea in your field though.

* London, maybe Manchester.

* Tuition for foreign students is pretty high - think $15-20k per year.

* Not sure on what laws are specific - you can Jay walk, you need a license to watch TV, you can't turn left on red, you can't say racist things.

* Fish and chips are good - but you can get whatever you like here. Indian/Chinese/Italian/Japanese etc etc should all be covered in a major city.

* Politicians in the UK aren't as crazy as in the US. They disagree, but they don't have the Christian fundamentalists to pander to which helps. 

* Immigrating is probably tough unless you have a specific skill set - you'd have to look up how in demand neuro-science is.

Tuition for university is expensive, though again, I don't have much comparison.
No exciting laws, things are pretty normal. Obviously no guns, like, ever.


Social customs, nothing special. Everyone will call you mate, people don't really make much small talk in cities, complaining about the weather is a good start if you do want to make small talk! In my little world, sport is completely unimportant - not sure I've ever heard anyone talk about sport other than world events.


I used to watch cartoon network, the Internet exists nowadays though, so not sure it's as relevant. Cable TV seems to have lots of channels, though I don't really watch TV.


Fish isn't eaten as much as other countries. Food is pretty normal, we have a lot of emphasis on homemade proper food, rather than processed food.


Politicians are a lot more sane than in the US - we focus on how to spend the budget, rather than on sexual issues.

Depends where you go: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16963717 In general, the further south you go the nicer the weather.

&gt; Is the UK post-secondary educational system reputable or mediocre?

We punch far above our weight in terms of population or GDP with the results we get from our universities. UK physics has more citations than the USA, despite having less people, less universities, and less money. Yes, it's very reputable. 

&gt;I can't stand the incredible royal Drama I constantly hear about in the News. I couldn't care less about some Prince marrying a Commoner. Is this a big cultural phenomenon, or do people usually just not care?

I think this was a bigger deal in other countries that it was our own. Most people enjoyed the day off work and had a street party, but in general we just ignore the royals.

&gt; Any idea what the Job market is like? Specifically for (Neuro-) Scientists?

No idea, that's not my area of expertise.

&gt; I love living in big, urban cities. New York was wonderful, for example. Any idea what cities I should look at?

London, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle.

&gt; What are some social customs I should adapt to? I don't want to embarrass myself on the first day.

Don't be a crass, loud, yank, that complains because everything is different in Britain. If you do that, you'll be fine. Don't try and do a British accent. Don't try and use the slang.

&gt; This is obviously not that important, but what's British TV like? Do you have an equivalent of Cartoon Network? What are the major Networks?

We have Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon. UK TV is pretty good, most people in the country has access to [Freeview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_terrestrial_television_channels_\(UK\)), which as the name implies, is free. Depending on where you are, there are up to 50 SD channels, plus five HD. There's also national coverage from satellite operator Sky, and about 50% coverage from cable provider VirginMedia. Both Sky and VM are premium services - you pay for them, but you get hundreds of rubbish channels with lots of repeats.

&gt; I heard you all love Fish. I hate Fish. What's the British Cuisine like?

* Considering how far North we are, we have a surprisingly warm climate (we're at roughly the same lattitude as Newfoundland yet have winters milder than DC.)  That comes with a price exacted by the North Atlantic jetstream; prevailing westerly depressions bearing rain feature heavily in our weather.

* Some UK universities are excellent, some are not so good.  The big league players are world class.

* The Royals don't feature much in daily life.  Easy to tune out if you're not interested.

* Social customs: we're not a very tactile people.  Shaking hands is good (but no limp, damp handshakes!) but hugs and stuff is generally reserved for close friends and family.  We queue like nobody else.  If you're in a queue, jumping is very bad form (I think you would call it ""cutting line"").  Politeness is always welcome but is less prevalent in the larger metropolises.  There is quite a lot more!

* Native British cuisine is pretty bland.  Meat and veg with a little salt and pepper.  That's not very prevalent any more though and if you're in a city you'll be able to find pretty much anything you're after.  Even the smallest town has Chinese, Indian, Italian etc in addition to good old fish'n'chips.  You'll also find plenty of KFC and McD's but sadly very few  of your more varied, smaller fast-food chains.  You have to check out some of our stuff though.  A real Cornish Pasty is priceless, as is a Melton Mowbray pork pie and a hot Scotch egg.

* Politicians?  At a first glance our Conservatives (blue) = your Republicans and our Labour (red) = your Democrats as opposites in a bipartite, bicameral government but both of our main parties are actually centre to centre-right parties with very little on the real left any more.  They pretend to be opposites but are more like a slightly different view of the same thing, quite unlike the extreme polarity of US politics.

When Meireles signed under Hodgson, he was guaranteed (or promised) a pay-raised after one season.
Hodgson left, FSG and Henry came in, Dalglish came on as manager.


Dalglish and Co. did not honour the agreement the previous management granted Meireles. Meireles decided to stay with Liverpool but there were doubts whether or not he would actually stay.

Chelsea came knocking at the last hour and Liverpool eventually agreed to sell Meireles. The only problem was if they sold Meireles, they would have to pay him a loyalty fee or something like that. Meireles was asked if he would like to join Chelsea (meaning a massive pay bump) and he agreed.

You can also set up charitable foundations in different countries and move them around to avoid tax havens but still effectively pay no tax.

* Its pretty reputable. There are some poor choices that you could make but there are a few university's that are leaders in there field. Like you would with any university system, you have to be selective and do your research.

* The American media seem to have a greater fondness for the British royal family than even we do. When we do celebrate them its for there hard work and service to the country.

* Job market is pretty bad for low skilled jobs. If you are in an elite academic field then it is probably a lot easier to find a job as a scientist as the UK science industry is really productive with a lot of research being funded.

* London. Birmingham. Leeds. Manchester. Off the top of my head they are the 4 biggest city's in England. I think London is the only one of the city's that approaches New York in size but what you will find is that it is not nearly as organised as the citys have grown organically.
EDIT: I live near Leeds and I would say that its probably not the best place to look for places in a science industry. Leeds is becoming the northern base for finance centric corporations and from my knowledge most of the science industry's are concentrated towards the south of England.

* UK tuition fee's have increased quite a bit in the last couple of years. You can get grants to reduce the cost of school and you only begin paying off any student debts once you are earning a suitable income. From what I have seen of the American university system the debts are not towards the $100,000 scale but I did not go to university so I could not give you a good gauge as to what a typical British university student pays for there education.

* We have a lot of small laws that you might fall victim to. You can be fined for not putting your rubbish in a bin and letting your dog shit in a public area without cleaning them up. Smoking is banned in all public places. A lot of these might sound draconian but it just stops the environment turning into a cesspit of food packets and dog shit.

* Smoking will alienate you, unless you also smoke. Racism and homophobia unless around similar minded people will have you condemned. We also hate spitting and binge drinking.

* British TV is like American TV. The 5 ""free"" channels have pretty good programming overall. The best stuff is on the BBC channels and on Channel 4 with pretty good documentary's and entertainment shows.
All of those have online on demand catchup services that are ad driven with some even being mirrored on Youtube for even easier viewing. The an obsession with celebrity like in America especially on Cable tv but theres also hidden gems that require some discovery. We have Cartoon Network.

* We do have a great history of sea food but the UK is such a multicultural place now that you can pretty much any type of cuisine that you may desire. London is a culinary mecca with some the greatest restaurants in the world being there. Indian cuisine is rather popular here but theres so many ethnic groups that now reside here that you can be spoilt for choice at times, especially in the citys.

* The politicians in the last 15 years have been trying to sit in the centre while still falling back on there party ideals when it comes to matters of Economics and employment. After Tony Blair who was winning landslide elections appealing to the centre left the right wing party's have begun to occupy the centre and opposing party's tend to be a bit more selective with policys that they choose to vehemently oppose. A lot of the politicians, which you will see in the house of commons during Primeministers Questions, get along quite well and have a laugh and a joke even if it is at there expense. It is all good fun and rarely does it turn nasty.

* If you are skilled or are coming for an education then I would imagine that it would not be very hard at all. When I was in college we had students come from all over the world to study various things.

* When it comes to crime you will find that the UK is rather tame. Gun crime is incredibly rare with most anti firearm police retiring at the end of there careers having never fired a single bullet in service. Knife crime and other violent crime is a problem, it is falling but it does not help with the London Riots and other high profile cases skewing public perception.

&gt; You're speaking of the market economy in action, not what should really happen.

I'm speaking of what really happens, not what moral judgements suggest might be possible to happen under some magical circumstances that have never existed in British civilisation. What should happen is that money shouldn't exist at all and everyone should share equally, but not only the current world system but everything that led to it has been based on greed, avarice and currency. In light of that fact, the market economy functioning correctly is the fairest chance we have. When it functions incorrectly it's a terrible thing, but for the most part increased competition has been a good thing.

&gt; Why should private entities be allowed to potentially bankrupt the country because a few one excessive wealth?

Privatised public sources didn't threaten the country. A complex interwoven network of interests based on financial services led to a situation where financial services companies were allowed to potentially bankrupt the country.

&gt; The example of the money going back into the treasury, isn't that then just a masquerade for possible corruption then?

You're beginning to get it, you're not quite there though. Corruption in the traditional sense does exist in this country, but the big corruption scandals aren't with dodgy local authorities. Of the money going back to the treasury some is reallocated and some is used to pay bonds. The thing is that a lot of HMG departments are told that if they don't spend it they lose it, so they fund frivolous schemes and bizarre activities to make sure they don't lose the funding for next year. Add to that ministerial and party interests being more important than what's right for the people and you have the real corruption in this country, but that's only a problem if you believe that the government represents the people instead of paying lip service while bending to it's real masters, the Crown.

&gt; A lot of the points you raise are the failure of government and power greedy leaders, not failure of the system

The system functions perfectly. The system is why you have to work to pay debts you took on to buy shit you don't need. The system loves you. The system gives you page 3 tits, X Factor and polarising debate in which there is only black and white, red or blue and labour or tory. The system is that which enslaves you, nurtures you, brainwashes you into thinking it's accountable to you, when all you are is a source of revenue and a cost centre.

edit - Sorry I forgot to correct your description of the NSS etc. as ""anti-religion"" (taking your comment as a whole). [Secularism calls for the equal treatment of everybody, regardless of race, religion, sex or sexuality and more](http://www.secularism.org.uk/what-is-secularism.html). It calls for no automatic and privileged place for religion in government. Religious people, we know from polls &amp; surveys, are by and large secular in their thinking, as are most people. This is because it's a very obviously sensible stance to take. I imagine you yourself are secular in your thinking. Secularists have actually worked in the past to uphold the rights of (minority) religious groups, you know.

However you distinguish yourself from people who campaign - ""outspoken secularists"" - because you somehow think that speaking about the problems and making wider issues know is ""boring"", and is ""pathetic"".

Did you know that the founder of the NSS, [Charles Bradlaugh, was barred from taking his seat as an MP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bradlaugh#Parliament) more than once because he refused to say the (religious and mentioning 'G'od) Oath that all MPs had to swear before they could enter the House of Commons (He was also imprisoned, fined and beaten up for his trouble). ""Outspoken secularists"" are the reason that non-religious MPs can now sit in the House (without lying) and why when you go to court you don't have to swear on the bible.     
The way the country is now is not how it used to be and religious influence has waned due to the work of ""outspoken secularists."" Do you really think that it would have happened, that religious influence such as that in some US states - ""No atheist can hold office"" - would have simply fallen out of law, if it were not for secularists making waves?

If you think that's a trivial and boring matter, then I suggest you do some research into what ""boring"" ""pathetic"" ""outspoken secularists"" have done for the minorities past in this country and continue to do today. Because people like myself - an ""outspoken secularist"", you might have guessed - are doing a hell of a lot of work to combat the influence of people who would rather like to see everyone live under and by their religiously motivated rules. Those rules are often divisive, unfair, exclusionary and intolerant. Most of us do it for free - in fact the NSS has only about four members of paid staff.

No, I don't downvote because I'm not a prick - at least not when it comes to things like this. But it's always interesting to see who decides that ""a debate in forum X is not as important as debate in forum Y"", as though the fact that someone is anonymous somehow undermines their line or argumentation or automatically means their reasoning is flawed.

The act of downvoting a comment you (one) simply do not agree with is indicative to being unable to defend your position, and wishing to silence the opposition: downvoting because you don't agree is putting your fingers not only in your own ears, but everyone else's too. That's why I don't downvote, because I'm not scared of my position being challenged. I either strengthen that position by discussing it, or I see where I'm wrong and change my mind.

The karma doesn't matter, of course, and I would have thought you'd have seen where I was coming from by mentioning the voting. Either you don't and hopefully now you do, or you did anyway and are trying to somehow make out like ""lol this argument doesn't matter because it's on the internet"". If it is the latter - I hope that works out for you.

But I imagine you know all that and so are clouding the issue that you've been slapped around this place but trying to pretend you're not feeling a little bit of a mental twinge by having had so much counter to your position. Cognitive dissonance, of a sort, ftw.

Tbf I am parroting a lecturer I've had this year on the ITSC thing largely- I'm sorry the BMJ link didn't come up, I didn't know it was behind  a wall- must be because I'm on the university network at the moment that it's working. The gist of the article is that the treatment centres did possibly have a detrimental effect on some aspects of funding, but that they also had a positive sum effect on reducing waiting lists and getting public departments to improve quality of care to prevent patients and funding bleeding into the private sector.

I've only worked in the NHS, not private sector, and even then only for 6 months, so cannot compare efficiencies (and even then not as medical staff but in the NCRS). Having worked privately in other industries, as well as publically in the prison service and local government, I have seen more efficiency in the private businesses I've worked for, but of course this experience is anecdotal so I would never project it upon my argument- plus any fool can see examples of highly inefficient private organisations, so I would never contest that the private sector is a magic efficiency bullet! I definitely see your argument, and am largely playing devil's advocate.

The crux of what I was saying, or perhaps meant to say (if I was unclear) is that I feel that many people haven't done their homework on the bill and are rejecting it for the wrong reasons. I think that it has been rushed, much of it badly thought out, and some of the good aspects fudged by essentially bad politics. I also feel that the NHS needs to be kept public, but I think it is daft for people to react to competition and aspects of privatisation as some kind of boogie man, when some of the most positive steps under New Labour were the result of bringing in competition, as it keeps management on its toes. I also think, and maybe you'd agree, that if this bill is smashed, or continues to be badly administered, that positive aspects, such as the decentralisation and devolution of decision making closer to the patient level may be politically put back years until it is much harder or even too late. I worry that lack of thought both by the coalition and opponents of this bill have come together to create the worst of all possible worlds for the NHS.

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

tl;dr of it all is basically that too much sugar is bad for you, and sugar in moderation is fine if it's HFCS or otherwise. HFCS is a bit worse, but *all* sugar is bad for you really, its an unnecessary component of your diet. However as long as you keep an eye on calories from sugar then you don't have to worry too much about HFCS either.

The big problem with HFCS is not that it's unhealthy, but that in the US especially they put a lot of it in a lot of things (because it's cheap) - any type of sugar would be super bad for you in those amounts anyway, but it's hardly like a bit here and there will have any adverse effects at all.

How can effective competition work roadways? You would need to routes going the same way, what is the solution to that? Double decker lanes? I can think of one toll road (though hazy, iirc it's the M6) that is barely used due to the charges. How do you force users off one road onto another and how would that be fair or reasonable? Roads are a natural monopoly. It's as near to impossible to privatise as you can be got. Even, iirc, Friedman thought natural monopolies believed in natural monopolies and considered them to be a problem!

The danger for the Tories is this:  

Because this law is so well publicised and is considered a massive change, *any* problem with the NHS in the next few years *will be blamed on directly the government*.  Now the government may get the blame anyway for NHS failings anyway, but in enacting this law, they are going to be held *directly* responsible for everything that goes wrong, whether it has something to do with this law or not.  This is not smart as there's going to be some horror stories about the NHS in the coming years because:

a) it's a massive organisation, as such, it's statistically likely there's always going to be some kind of terrible thing happening

b) it's a time of austerity and cuts anyway.  This will inevitably impact services, both directly and indirectly.  The economic downturn will lead to greater demand for services as poorer living conditions and diets lead to poorer health.  There will also be less money to pay for those services.

c) any bureaucratic change will necessarily have a cost in terms of efficiency

d) the law has genuine problems which will lead to negative outcomes.

The main principle of the Time Lords was non-interference and neutrality, to the point where they became aloof and even decadent.  They would act against other races that threatened them, but wouldn't interfere in the universe purely for the sake of doing good.  

It might be that the Time Lords didn't protect time so much as protect themselves, and would let other races develop time travel technology so long as they weren't a threat to Time Lord superiority.  So you could be onto something here: maybe the Time Agency became more powerful than it would have become while the Time Lords were around to keep them in their place.

It’s very often forgotten what he was doing in that case was sending to prison a group of Yiddish speaking socialists, whose literature was printed in a language most Americans couldn’t read, opposing Mr. Wilson’s participation in the First World War, and the dragging of the United States into that sanguinary conflict, which the Yiddish speaking socialists had fled from Russia to escape.

He also battles humans who have the ability to bring dinosaurs forward through time, as well as send things back to roughly that far within a small section of London (invasion of the dinosaurs)
The 4th doctor discovers a menace from the 51st century in the Talons of Weing Cheing. The time cabinet the villan used has monstrously transformed him though.
The fifth doctor confirms the Daleks now have the ability to operate time corridors, but these seem to be poor constructions (resurrection of the daleks)
Fuzzy on the details but there is some time travel involved with Cybermen in Earthshock as well. Was a one shot thing by the cybermen I think. 
The 6th doctor encounters a madman with a time corridor in Timelash.

In classic Who, none of the other time travelers could move with the ease and accuracy of a 'modern' Tardis. And only The Master, The Rani, The Warlord, and the Meddling Monk had these. All Time Lords. All villains. 

The Time Lords were not the good guys. They fought three time wars, sure, but only against the three largest threats in the universe--from it's start to their finish. Only to save themselves.

The Libs are not protecting anyone from anything at this point in time, there are 'sweeping' reforms in the offings, and at play, and at this moment in time the Libs are enabling a tory agenda, with the socialist vote (which is allowing the tories to claim a mandate for change - c.f HCR). 

I remain unconvinced that a general election in forced by the libs pulling out would result in a tory win outright. They've done enough to show the general populous what will befall them under their guidance already. Regardless of both predicted and actual outcomes, a country gets the ruling party it elects, ***and we did not elect conservative government***. A new election would at least force a honest representation of party politics, not this forced, unnatural and unwelcomed (by the lib voters) cozying of the Conservatives and LibDems. 

Honestly, I'd rather see Labour back in, and I dislike them only marginally less than the Tories. The Libs on the other hand have lost my vote for life.

My sister recently posted 2 birthday cards to the same address.  Both were posted at the same time from the same place. They were both roughly the same size, shape, weight and had the same postage applied.  One (in a white envelope) arrived the next day, the other one (in a coloured envelope) never turned up.  She happened to mention it to her postman.  He advised her to never send any cards in coloured envelopes.  Not because the sorting machines have trouble reading the addresses, or anything obvious like that, but because the staff working at her local sorting office (Kingston) routinely open any cards that they think might contain money. Apparently they are blatantly open about this, opening hundreds of cards, day in, day out.   Everyone connected with the sorting office knows it's going on but the staff are protected by a militant union and no-one can do anything about it.

This is all 3rd hand hearsay, of course.  But I totally agree with your advice on never sending anything valuable via Royal Mail.",0,1332235053,null,0,false,0,c42wpt6,t3_r45xi,t1_c42wpt6,t1_c42s66x,null,1428558615,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Other investments can be anything from currency, commodities, bonds, shares, property, infrastructure to name a few, but the important part is the tax not the return.

Parker's also a more physical type of player who is unlikely to play on for as long - Berbatov's style of play could easily see him carry on at the top level for another four or five years.

Striker's also demand higher fees in general, don't forget - Levy finding 6m for a 31 year old midfielder objectionable doesn't necessarily mean he woudn't consider 8m for a 31 year old striker a bit of a bargain.

&gt;**Continental shelf:  If Westminster retains control of Shetland, Orkney and Rockall, Scotland will have no oil resources.**
&gt;
&gt;If Scotland becomes independent Westminster won't be able to hang on to Shetland, Orkney, Rockall or any other part of Scotland (see: Shetland and Orkney). 
&gt;
&gt;However, even under the hypothetical circumstance that this occurred, Westminster wouldn't be able to retain control of the oil fields anyway, so ya boo sux.  These matters are regulated by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which the UK is a signatory.  International law specifies that a state controls the continental shelf and associated mineral and fishing rights up to 200 nautical miles (230 miles or 370 km) off its shores.  When another state possesses an island within the continental shelf of this state, special rules apply.
&gt;
&gt;The continental shelf off the Atlantic coast is Scotland's to exploit and develop, even if Westminster clung on to Rockall like a plook on the face of an adolescent sociopath.  According to the Law of the Sea: ""rocks which could not sustain human habitation or economic life of their own would have no economic zone or continental shelf.""  Westminster could pauchle its way to keeping Rockall, but as far as oil and fishing exploitation rights are concerned, they'd be entitled to rockall.  
&gt;
&gt;Neither would Westminster gain much by holding onto Shetland and Orkney.  When an island belonging to one state sits on the continental shelf of another state, the islands are treated as enclaves.  This matter was discussed in detail in a legal paper published by the European Journal of International Law:  Prospective Anglo-Scottish Maritime Boundary Revisited
&gt;
&gt;Most of the rights to the continental shelf would remain Scottish, [Map 2](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/images/stories/maritimeboundaries.png) on page 29 of the legal paper shows the most likely sea boundaries.  Westminster would be entitled only to a small zone around the islands, and the waters between Orkney and Shetland.  This area contains no oil fields.  If Shetland and Orkney were to remain under Westminster's control, Shetland would no longer have an oil fund.  The map is reproduced here, so you can do a reverse Jeremy Paxman and sneer derisively at Westminster's pretensions.

In fact, I would hold that Kropotkin’s basic argument is correct. Struggle does occur in many modes, and some lead to cooperation among members of a species as the best pathway to advantage for individuals. If Kropotkin overemphasized mutual aid, most Darwinians in Western Europe had exaggerated competition just as strongly. If Kropotkin drew inappropriate hope for social reform from his concept of nature, other Darwinians had erred just as firmly (and for motives that most of us would now decry) in justifying imperial conquest, racism, and oppression of industrial workers as the harsh outcome of natural selection in the competitive mode.""

And given this behavior seems to be repeated all over the planet in a variety of cultures (so not something you can blame on capitalism and ignore), I would have to say that it is a part of human nature.

I'm not sure how an Independent Scotland could deny them (if it was requested by a majority) without looking hypocritical. The last time they formed a coalition, they got the [best result at the time for a candidate not from one of the four main parties in Scotland] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney_and_Shetland_Movement) - granted, this was in 1989, but then in those days, nobody in Scotland was talking about devolution/ independence either and their results still showed a bit less than 99%-for-Scotland. I would therefore suggest that, if Scotland's independence rests on oil revenue, it would be a serious concern if those revenues could potentially disappear within a few years. You can't label something potentially damaging like this as merely FUD; these MP's may be crazy, but that doesn't mean their points aren't valid.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Why?  No ideological mechanism for the organisation of a complex modern society has ever been specified with clarity in a precis.  That's inevitably more the case with anarchism because it's fundamentally about giving people the choice about how they want to live and how they want to organise their society.  Noam Chomsky puts it this way:

""I tend to agree that anarchism is formless and utopian, though hardly more so than the inane doctrines of neoliberalism, Marxism-Leninism, and other ideologies that have appealed to the powerful and their intellectual servants over the years, for reasons that are all too easy to explain. The reason for the general formlessness and intellectual vacuity (often disguised in big words, but that is again in the self-interest of intellectuals) is that we do not understand very much about complex systems, such as human societies; and have only intuitions of limited validity as to the ways they should be reshaped and constructed.

Anarchism, in my view, is an expression of the idea that the burden of proof is always on those who argue that authority and domination are necessary. They have to demonstrate, with powerful argument, that that conclusion is correct. If they cannot, then the institutions they defend should be considered illegitimate. How one should react to illegitimate authority depends on circumstances and conditions: there are no formulas.

In the present period, the issues arise across the board, as they commonly do: from personal relations in the family and elsewhere, to the international political/economic order. And anarchist ideas -- challenging authority and insisting that it justify itself -- are appropriate at all levels.""

If you, or anyone else, really wants to read a practical, down-to-earth, grounded in reality vision of what anarchism might look like in practice, what works, and what problems remain to be solved, I'd recommend getting hold of a copy of Anarchy Works by Peter Gelderloos.

&gt;**Yes.** Christianity has a clear and distinctive creation story which is relevant to *all* areas of the curriculum. We know that ‘some people think differently‘ so we will be sure to give full weight to other views of the origins and purposes of life.  Our science curriculum will be broad and well-balanced, looking at the assumptions, evidence and interpretations behind scientific theories. Michael Gove’s  view that ‘teaching creationism is at odds with scientific fact’ will be taken into account. (Note: **80%** of our pupils achieve GCSE grades **A\*-C** in Science courses)

Obviously there would be many merits in switching to a more proportional system. But that's basically off the agenda for the near future.

National share of the vote is a really nice statistic, and a great benchmark for how the election turned out in general; but it is also a fundamentally useless statistic because it does not represent how our electoral system works.

The ultimate flaw of looking at our FPTP system through national vote share goggles is that you start thinking along the lines of ""23% of voters voted LibDem, therefore 23% of seats should be LibDem"" - whereas really, that's meaningless, since seats are not decided by individual voters, or by national share; they are decided by the share of the vote in each constituency; which does not correspond to the national vote share.",0,1332258104,null,0,false,0,c42z9dp,t3_r3qce,t1_c42z9dp,t1_c42y2ic,null,1428559822,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"I think this is a point often overlooked.  The placebo effect is, in some cases, the only effective treatment that can be given for things such as long term chronic pain where the cause is not apparent.

The high effectiveness of the placebo effect in homoeopathy comes down to the very detailed consultations that are held and the sense that the patient is getting a 'bespoke solution'.  It also helps that homoeopaths are generally smiley, happy purveyors of woo who have tie dye wall hangings and aromatherapy candles and the like and are a million miles away from the big scary hospital that couldn't do anything for you.

Now, in a perfect world we would be able to have all of the above, without the accompanying nonsense about super dilution and shaking it just so before hitting it with a bit of wood.  There are clearly some very cynical (or deluded, but probably just cynical) companies making a lot of money off of homoeopathic remedies.  But as things stand, doctors can't just send people off for a nice chat and then tell them that they're going to take a sugar pill that will make them better, because medical ethics dictate that you can't come out and tell bare-faced lies to your patients.

So by offering homoeopathy, the NHS is basically making the placebo effect available to people who need it.  People criticize homoeopathy for not being able to perform better than the placebo effect in double blind trials, but don't stop to think that the placebo effect is still something important and desirable, but which otherwise cannot be delivered by the NHS with their commendable dedication to provable science and medical ethics.",0,1332258114,null,0,false,0,c42z9g1,t3_r50yu,t1_c42z9g1,t1_c42yuz1,null,1428559822,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

3. Indeed, I moved there from living in the city for thirty years, and I'm still gettinging used to woods and fields over concrete :-)

Even so, I'm not so sure things are that politically limited any more. Remember, the last time we went as left as possible, we ended up in a virtual war between the unions and the government. I grew up with piles of rubbish (dustmen strike), electricity going off at 8pm  (another strike)...and the Government's solution to this was to ask 'who really runs the country?' in an election and we got a hung parliament. I think the time of American-style polarisation (you're either left or right) is over, we have to take the best bits of both.

the most typical ones for me are:

* the Welsh being sheep botherers
* the Whippet racing, flat cap wearing simpletons from Yorkshire
* the perpetual pie eating people of Wigan
* the thieving twats from Liverpool
* Boring Brummies who are as interesting as the city they live in (ie. not very)
* the west country folk who all be farmers and speak like they're a member of the wurzels oo arr
* Soft arse southerners in general who complain at a bit of rain or when it's a little cold, bloody pansies
* Scots are drunken louts who are as likely to be sober as a priest is to be drunk

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"Yes, bollocks. If you count 07 to 09 only then it's still only a 1250 increase. This is totally ignoring the fact that the reason it went up 800 quid in 08 is because the 10p rate of tax was abolished. 

**edit** for a clearer picture let's look at percentage increase. 

* '01 3.4%
* '02 1.7%
* '03 0%
* '04 2.8%
* '05 3.2%
* '06 2.9%
* '07 3.8%
* '08 15.5%
* '09 7.3%
* '10 0%
* '11 15.4%
* '12 8.4% 

So, in the 10 years from 2000 under labour it went up an average of 4.1% a year. 

Under the current government it has gone up an average of 11.9% a year. 

Even when you cherry pick your dates the only year that increased more than either of the last two years is 08 when the 10p rate was abolished. 

**edit 2**

Well, firstly all anarchists worth the name would support a universal healthcare system free at the point of use under currently existing capitalism.  Secondly, as I've said before, in dismantling the State the order is important, so we wouldn't be fucking with the NHS now - there are plenty of privileged relationships with the State, where capitalists are exploiting us and working people are getting a shitty deal currently which we need to be dismantling or addressing first!

Anyway, to the point, [here](http://libcom.org/thought/health)'s an anarcho-commie response which makes some points I agree with.  But in general terms, I'd choose to turn our current State-run system into something more [mutual](http://c4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/C4SS-The-Healthcare-Crisis-A-Crisis-of-Artificial-Scarcity-by-Kevin-A.-Carson.pdf) in the longer term.  Carson is clearly coming at it from the ""other end"" (opposing a hugely distorted and State-protected system of corporate healthcare) and I've no problem with people paying for their healthcare directly rather than via taxation, so long as poor people are guaranteed a better deal than they are currently via the NHS and it's not just a revenue generating scam for pseudo-private cronies as it clearly is under the Tories proposed scheme.

But they have to teach the National Curriculum, go through the same OFSTED inspection as the community schools, and their admissions policy has to be acceptable to the local authority. 

This is quite different from the new ""free schools"" which are allowed to teach what they want, have their own inspection regime, and run their own admissions policy. 

In our county an evangelical denomination is starting its own school on these lines. All the kids will come from their church. So at home and at school the kids will be raised in a bubble with few outside influences. That can't be healthy.

Anyway... you forgot Martha.  The sequence is more like this:  The Doctor falls in love with and loses Rose (with a brief detour over to Madame Pompadour who tragically dies before he can run off with her in the TARDIS... dunno how she and Rose would have got along).  Picks up with Martha on the rebound and basically ignores her until she dumps his sweet butt.  Actually tries to go sailing off with the Master, except the Master has other plans (that look remarkably like ""I'd rather die than be your companion!"").  Tries to start something with Astrid, but she dies.  Ends up with Donna whether he likes it or not (fortunately ends up liking it).  Thinks for a moment that he's going to settle down and play at being a ""dad"" to his daughter, but she also does a convincing imitation of dying.  Loses Donna tragically and spends a bit of time with her grandad, Wilf.  Dies, regenerates, and crashes in Amelia Pond's backyard.

And from what your suggesting, that the level of centralization and sheer scale of the NHS is more of a problem than a good thing given that it requires more management, it's not that different from my arguments against simply spending more on the NHS.

Big Finish have released a Doctor Who audio play every month since July of 1999, each with an average runtime of around 2 hours. As of February of this year, they're up to 157 releases in the monthly series.

Additionally, they've produced four series of Eighth Doctor adventures for BBC7 radio, each of which was approximately an hour in length: A total of 32 episodes so far.

They've also produced a robust selection of spin-offs, lost stories, and ""Companion Chronicles"" two-person audiobooks, but for purposes of these calculations, I'm only counting the main lines of full cast audio dramas.

The classic series of Doctor Who includes 686 episodes of approximately 22.5 minutes apiece, plus 13 episodes of 45 minutes apiece, plus 90 minutes for The Five Doctors, plus 90 minutes for the Paul McGann movie.

So, the entirety of Classic Doctor Who totals around 302.25 hours of runtime.

Only counting the monthly series and the Eighth Doctor ongoing series, Big Finish's output totals around 346 hours.

true,ScoWeazy,lfcflame,,"I think, and this is just a wild guess, that most of the anti-Dalglish sentiment comes from Rafa supporters. Rafa, to some people, was a manager who could do no wrong. Dalglish tends to have the same effect to some degree. Should there be some criticism? Sure, but not to the point of saying he should be fired.

The primary focus on Dalglish has been the money spent on the squad. People tend to forget that the Liverpool setup is now different and the manager does not have absolute control over player transactions. If you are upset about the books, point a finger at Commolli and Ayre. But nevertheless, you can't complain about players like Adam, Henderson, and Carroll while overlooking the successes of Enrique and Bellamy. Under Dalgish, youngsters like Kelly and Spearing have also been given a chance and have proven they can shine.

It would be nice to be doing better in the league, but ""fans"" have already forgotten the club spent most of the season without Steven Gerrard, no Lucas, and had Suarez absent for 9 matches. Yet, we still managed to end a 6 year trophy drought and are back at Wembley in the FA Cup. With as much adversity as the club as faced with new players settling, injuries, and what not, I wouldn't write the season off as awful and would not want another manager.

I wish the BBC would have checked the facts, here. Someone who earns £116,210 will get **no** tax free allowance, as for every £2 you earn over £100k, £1 gets deducted from your tax free allowance. 

This means for this portion of income, tax ends up being over 60%, and if you add NI to that you end up taking home less than 1/3rd of money earned in that particular wage bracket.

Stinks.

**Edit:** Why the downvotes? It's just **fact**. Tax-free allowance starts to get removed when someone earns more than £100k, and is completely gone when you earn £115k.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"I'm a bit confused as to your thesis here. Are you suggesting that Doctor Who was directly inspired by American consumerist culture, or that it was created to appeal to the American consumerist culture that was setting the tone for popular culture in the latter 20th century?

If the former is your thesis, I'm not entirely sure that it bears up. Your plot summary, for example, states that it is:
&gt;A time traveling space alien that is able to save the world, stop Hitler, and make sure that humans never have to live through that kind of strife again.

Now, going back to the very first few episodes of Doctor Who, the fact that the Doctor was from another time and place was strongly alluded to, but was not specifically identified as an alien until much later. [This source](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Stories_set_in_World_War_II) has a list of Doctor Who stories set in World War II, and [this one](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Hitler) details the times Hitler has appeared in the Doctor Who stories; neither provide any evidence that an anti-Nazi sentiment was behind the conception of Doctor Who. Additionally, the Doctor didn't really get around to the whole saving Earth thing until later in his life; I'm going through the 1st Doctor's stories right now, and have just started *The Dalek Invasion of Earth*, which is the second story in the second season. And while the first two seasons were released without much time in between, I don't know if it can be said with any real certainty that the idea of the Doctor as a planetary hero and defender of the Earth was at the core of the show's foundational characteristics. Finally, in the earliest days of the show, the story began on Earth in the 1960s, but did not return to that same spatial/temporal setting for quite some time, and many of the stories were set in the very distant past, such as the time of the Aztecs, the Romans, or even the discovery of fire in the very first story. In fact, the inability to change history is a strong theme in the story *The Aztecs* and would seem to indicate that history will do whatever human nature dictates.

Now, if you meant the latter thesis, that Doctor Who was created to appeal to the increasing trend of the American consumerist culture, then I am again unsure of how you are drawing this connection. The rise of consumerism and the prosperous economy in addition to other contextual historical and cultural factors brought the United States into the Cold War, which in turn begat the space race, which fueled interest in science fiction as a genre... and I follow your argument thus far. But to make the next leap is a bit more tenuous, since you are attributing the creation of Doctor Who to, basically, an attempt on Britain's part to captivate an American audience. And this is problematic, because Doctor Who did not start being aired in the US [until 1965, three years after it began in Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_in_Canada_and_the_United_States).

From my understanding, Doctor Who was originally conceived as an educational show for children, and using the veneer of science fiction would teach lessons about history and science. I will admit, my understanding of the history of British educational television is extremely limited, however I suppose one could argue that the focus on history and science was also influenced by the Cold War and the space race, which in the US at least increased the emphasis on science education in schools. But far be it from me to make such an argument.

In short, I think that while you have a strong grasp of history and its intersection with popular culture, the link to Doctor Who is much less clear. Out of curiosity, how much of Doctor Who have you seen and are familiar with? As I mentioned earlier, I'm watching through the 1st Doctor's stories right now, and there isn't a lot of evidence in the first couple of seasons to substantiate your claims.",0,1332282398,null,0,false,0,c434dar,t3_r5bi5,t1_c434dar,t3_r5bi5,null,1428562287,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

They weren't poor until Scargill decided to wait until the coal stockpiles were high before calling a strike. They were poor for the next year though until he decided to cross the picket line, and then left mining. I remember being next to Scargill and his entourage at a rally in my home town - there was a lot more going on than protecting miner's jobs. My wife's uncle became quite rich however due to all the overtime he got being a copper. It was a complicated strike, not worthy of being reduced to a one line editorialisation.

And what happened a year after the strike ended ? Evil Thatcher signed a deal to open up Nissan at Washington, bringing those jobs and all the ones at the suppliers. Please don't try and oversimplify this region and try to paint it as hard pressed Northerners dicked over by manipulative Southerners. Face it - mining was finished.

In both cases you would need a second ISDN point to call.

If you are going for the ISP route, I would make sure you can call with the bundled lines (charged at twice the rate, of course), as otherwise you will have quite less than 64 kbit uplink to work with due to the TCP/IP overhead and variability.

Archives are great with scene and usenet and all that as that's down to retention and not depending on seeders. It's also automatic decoding and extracting with scene. The downside with it with torrents is that, it's a pain in the arse (having to extract each and every single one...and that's if it's archived bit by bit) and takes up twice as much room if you want to keep seeding, thus, making the torrent less popular in the first place as it is incredibly annoying and 2)preventing many from seeding it properly. Also, if you archive it up all in one (or all in one archive split into multiple parts), then you can't prioritize!

Avoiding compression (which it would barely give here), the only other plusses for archives are checksums (which torrents provide anyway) and split archiving (which is...well...useless in torrenting!).

You also stop thinking that mincing around London in a Guy Fawkes mask looking for places to camp is going to do anything, the same goes with yelling at the police. You start talking to people where you live, you start organizing, and you start finding ways to make your protest appeal to people who happen to read the Telegraph or the Mail. You might not like all their views but you need to go out of your way to engage with people you've never spoken to before and get them interested in subjects like this. Quite often you will find some common ground on issues like this, even if they are someone who is ""concerned"" about immigration and "" benefit cheats"" they will care about the NHS. 

And other stuff like this. Essentially the point is that politics in the UK has become something which most people ignore aside from elections, and current activism something which most people find very annoying. Politicians aren't scared by the counterculture anymore, most of them were into that stuff when they were younger. The media won't cover it because it's simply not interesting, unless they are smashing stuff or having the shit kicked out of them by the police. So political activism needs to adapt and become relevant again by expanding it's appeal.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only, reconstructions are in place for the missing episodes).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His era is mostly missing so its hard to get a grip his era. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks.

The whole idea of the 2nd Amendment was that if there was ever a government in the US that would sell out its people to foreign interests, private individuals or organisations which would sellout the peoples liberty then the people would have the means to remove said government by force.

It is meant as a means of last resort when all other options have been used such as removing the main parties by voting etc (that however replies on the elections not being rigged or even held).

However this does require a informed, uncowed, and self-reliant population; this doesn't always work. With the right socioeconomic policies,expliotation of real threats, creation of perceived threats, distractions and bribes a population can be made to sell itself down the river(through fear or laziness) and distracted enough for the government to sell out their people behind closed doors.

Even when the public find out, and are outraged if you have played your cards right they will complain and moan but not take an active move to stop you because they perceive you as powerful and themselves as weak.

(I hate using this but bugger it)  
Post WW1 Germany is a prime example of this and what the outcome can be.

Keeping upto date, look at new the anti-terror laws.  The US patriot act which includes the words ""other purposes"" which are not defined and has been abused to buggery. The problem is both main parties support it and use it,  so how do you get rid of it? Right now its ""vote in someone who will get it removed"" the problem there is you need to ensure you have an honest election that isn't tampered with (which if you look at US media is having problems with) or you end up with what recently happened in Russia.

Now an informed public that is willing to take action? Well thats a different story since any politician will have to think ""do I really want to anger them?""

true,bluefold,null,null,"The 'licence fee' is not a catch all WE OWN IT BECAUSE WE PAY FOR IT!!! what it does is give the BBC the right to buy the licence to broadcast shows on our behalf and also to produce original drama that falls within one of these categories: high quality, originality, innovation, to be challenging and to be engaging. Non of this stops them brining it over to the US.

However there are some difficulties. The slightly lesser ones are the BBC does not make all the shows it airs. Take Hustle for example that is made by Kudos Film and Television for BBC One. Which mean that the BBC throws a bunch of money at them but they don't nesecarily buy the show outright but rather the right to show it. Kudos Film and Television most likely retain second airing rights and these are then sold separately. This can very often happen through the BBC but this is completely separate from the part of the BBC that has bought the rights originally.  

The other difficulty is that any action with a foreign government or anything overseas has to got through the Foreign Secretary which adds a whole bunch of extra logistical and bureaucratic problems.

However the main problem is the BBC trust are incredibly old fashioned formed of a group that average age is about 50+. They have been incredibly slow in adopting the internet and seeing the potential there. The BBC digital team wanted to provide ALL of the archived content 10 years ago and the idea was shot down as being too expensive for the amount of people who would use it and it is something that has come up time and time again each year. The have tried to push through other innovative things like Project Canvas to no look and it is only through blind luck and optimism that BBC iPlayer eventually got Ok'd. 

However this is changing. No one is denying that the internet is not here to stay and the UK streaming market is one of the most active and competitive in the world atm - which clears the major hurdle that the BBC offering their content would choke out any other competing service at the market is pretty strong now. 

You may have heard of Project Barcelona which is a new BBC initiative  to offer any content they have lying about (for a cost) on a download-to-own basis. They have not made it clear but it will either be £2 per episode (which seems a bit expensive) or £2 per show (which seems a bit cheap but gets my vote as I will buy a crap ton).

How is this good for America? Because with this service comes money. Both from the licence fee and any profit from sales. Which makes infrastructure much easier to put in place and potentially expansion into new markets. 

Here is my prediction:

By the end of the year there will be two new services. 

1. Project Barcelona - Which will be a UK only service for the first year which teething problems are ironed out and the market is tested/content digitised. 

2. A subscription service for non-brits to access iPlayer. You will have the same restrictions as the UK with perhaps a couple of extra weeks to watch stuff and it will be around the $5-10 mark. This would serve a dual purpose: It tests the market for Barcelona being released in America, from both a technological and financial stand point, and it also brings in more money for both projects at very little outlay.

Hope that helps a little and if the BBC don't end up doing something similar they are stupid as there is so much money to be made and original programming can only benefit from it.",0,1332292309,null,0,false,0,c43681m,t3_r5883,t1_c43681m,t3_r5883,null,1428563174,4,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,4

I didn't say that America created the US, I said that I don't think America's society was the main *influence* for its creation. The show became wildly popular without the Americans thanks to the Daleks. In fact, the Daleks brought on an entire phenomenon called Dalekmania in the 60s. I'm pretty sure the show could've stayed afloat without Americans. At best, the Tom Baker/Pertwee years were aired in the US in the 70s on PBS. I know several baby boomers who went their whole lives without ever hearing of DW. So really, America did not support Doctor Who's franchise in any immense way. It's still a largely obscure show here in the US (though gaining popularity since Matt Smith).

Also my details are important. I read your post and its content, please pay attention to mine.  Doctor Who was never meant to be science fiction originally, so the fact that ""the birth of a massive Sci-Fi concentration"" came from America is irrelevant. My other point about it being a link between two genres is a reason for why the show was *actually* created.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"Thank you for your reply. As far as Doctor Who being the culmination of several ongoing historical forces, I certainly agree with you. But the particularly American influence on the show's founding is what I was unclear of; would it be fair to say that the Soviet Union was just as interested in space as America? After all, they managed to launch Sputnik, which terrified most everyone west of the iron curtain and opened the real possibility of a war in space.

I greatly respect your goal to encourage others to consider the broader perspective. History is very much everything that happens, and we are the products of history, to take a Hegelian view. And I think that everyone here could agree that Doctor Who itself is very much geared towards encouraging people in a similar way; as the Doctor notes in *The God Complex*, ""Not all victories are about saving the universe,"" and this is something very easy for us to lose sight of.

I agree, nowhere in your post are you aggressive, and I hope that you don't find my replies offensive. Words are indeed powerful, but I wouldn't say they bring out the worst in people, merely that words alone are insufficient, and it is meaning and context that gives them power. The quotation from Doctor Who, for example, would not have its weight if we did not have a shared understanding of its original context.

Anyway, I'm still curious to know your background on this subject.

Streaming Engineer from Tone Radio (University Of Gloucestershire) here. We've found that provided you've got an ok 3G signal you'll get plenty of bandwidth. It's cheaper and will be easier to set up. You're also unlikely to be able to get an Internet connection through thier ISDN line for a day. So my suggestion would be 3G tech.

Good luck

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's mind blowing, and complicated, but this is my brake down (or how I see it):
We are first introduced to River Song, an Archeologist who seems to know EVERYTHING about the Doctor, in Silence in The Library/Forest of the dead, and we watch her die to save the doctor.
The Next time we see river is at the Byzantium, The Doctor has figured out that they have a future together but is unsure how, River and the Doctor are married after this point, and River has already 'killed' the Doctor at this point in time and has shared many experiences with him.
We next meet at the Pandorica, River does not know nearly as much about the doctor, but still familiar, the Doctor seems to trust her at this point but has only seen her a few times.
All that seems easy to infer, this is where it gets complicated
We see the older version of the Doctor, who knows that he is about to die, and that it is River that is about to do it, in this timeline he dies to River, and his body is burned, but not before he sent an invitation to his former self to keep himself alive.
Day of the Moon/Impossible astronaut happens, and some time during this or perhaps a bit before Amy, who is pregnant, is captured.
The next time River and The Doctor meet is before River's regeneration, and she is known as Mels. Mels is Amy's friend and has been for years, at this point Mels has been trained by the silence to kill The Doctor, but has escaped their control (as seen in Impossible astronaut). She is killed as Mels and regenerates after forcing the doctor to travel to Germany Pre-WWII.
She regenerates into River, a Woman the doctor already knows very well, able to use his knowledge of her The Doctor woos River song into saving him from Herself.

true,widgetas,null,null,"If you'll indulge me for a few minutes, I have to correct the misconceptions of my less well learned fellow r/ukers. Forgive their ignorance, but that's comprehensive education for you.

In the middle ages there were severe problems with public waste. I won't get too technical, [but this scene from Blackadder II should give you an idea of what I mean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=dvyRrYE5vJA#t=311s). Sewer systems were somewhat primitive, generally being left to the natural course liquid matter tends to find for itself when introduced to a muddy street.

The more well heeled folk of the city (we're talking London) found that going about their business was often interrupted by the business of others, either falling from above and adding unwanted adornments to overcoats or cloaks or sullying expensive footwear beneath.

An ingenious way of avoiding these fecal follies was devised by the master architect Sir Thomas Throbbitson in 1678 and was an immediate success. He realised that it would be a simple matter to utilise the existing close packed buildings' over hanging upper stories to support an aerial walkway above the rancid roadway below, to allow for the clean and sewerage free passage of pedestrians. This ""High Street"" as it became known was not funded by the tax payer, as we would expect now, but rather a toll was charged for its use. Obviously this meant that only people of means could afford to use the 'High Street' regularly and it became a somewhat exclusive thoroughfare. It was not long before upper storey rooms were being built atop rooves, or bedrooms converted and rented out to businessmen who flocked to set up 'exclusive' shops that only the posher inhabitants could afford to even visit in the first place. In consequence ""High Street"" shops have always been know for being notoriously over priced.

Thus, though the aerial ""High Streets"" of the past are long gone - mostly destroyed in the Blitz or torn down as part of the rejuvenation of the city of London when streets were widened to allow for the now defunct nuclear-trams of the 1950's - the name lingers on, as the rest of the country quickly followed London's lead and named their main retail thoroughfare after the fashionable and well-to-do clean rooftop streets of the capital.

Incidentally, the term ""Peeping Tom"" arises from the legendary tale of Sir Thomas refining his invention which he'd built on the outside of his home. Early one morning he was checking the supports and inadvertently peered in through his neighbour's window and caught the lady of the house in her birthday suit.

Most of the time the Doctor and River have a first or a last, they are opposite, but their timelines are not specifically running in opposition to each other.

As with any diet you have to watch your overall intake and take all types of calories from whatever you eat into account. If you limit your diet to 1500 calories per day (or whatever is suitable for you) then you're not going to end up obese... regardless of if those calories are all from anything from turkey+brown rice to donuts to pure HFCS. Of course you should be making sure you get all the other nutrients etc. you need, but the ""problem"" with HFCS is supposedly obesity/diabetes/etc. which is just simply nonsense unless you are eating too many calories due to it.. just read the freaking wrapper before you stick it in your mouth :P

Thing is there's absolutely nothing wrong with it as part of a balanced diet - but balancing a diet is something a lot of people seem unable to do. I cook 90% of what I eat myself from raw ingredients, including bread, pasta, etc. so I know exactly what I am eating - the rest of the time a few so called ""unhealthy"" snacks are really not unhealthy for me in even if they are imported from the US and full of HFCS (unless I binge on them, but the same is true of pretty much any food, haha).
