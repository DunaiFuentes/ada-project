Lampard has never gotten the credit/attention that he should, and Gerrard has always gotten more than he deserves. 

I guess this is probably because he can be a bit more of a 'flash' player at times. And also because in the eyes of the media Liverpool is generally revered and Chelsea
is generally despised. 

Neil Ashton wrote a good piece about Frank recently: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2137983/Frank-Lampard-deserves-better-fans-abuse--Neil-Ashton.html

Articles of this tenor regarding Lampard are exceedingly rare however, whilst the Gerrard media love-in regardless of his steady decline into premier league irrelevance, continues unabated.

I know I'm a Chelsea supporter, but I would objectively argue that Lampard has just as much quality, about double the football-ing intelligence, and quadruple the work-rate that Gerrard has ever, and will ever have.

true,Dossena,null,null,"Obviously part of the reason for wanting him staying is due to his history with the club. He has a connection with the club and the city. He gets what we're about and I believe his experience can help a new generation of players reach the greatness we once had. 

If you look at how the team played the majority of the time thoughout the season and compare it to how they were playing under Hodgson it's clear there is a big improvement. The players have been playing with more passion and determination. Sure it hasn't got the results but even when we've lost a lot of the time I'm usually proud of how they played. Unlike before Dalglish was in charge. So I assume he's had something to do with that. I know the blaming ""bad luck"" got tiring, but to a degree he's right. I'm not sure if you can blame the amount of times we've hit the woodwork or had super shots saved on the manager. 

The signings may have not been the best. I don't blame him for the amount we spent on Carroll (we were forced into that by Torres being a prick and leaving it to the last moment to leave us and Newcastle for seeing their chance to make big bucks). Hendo was expensive but is a long-term signing which if works out (i.e. he gets played in the right position more often) could end up being well worth the cash. Downing has had a poor season - though when it comes to finishing most of our team have, it just reflects worse on Stewie because he didn't get any Goals or Assists (in the league). Would be interesting to see the amount of goal-scoring opportunities he created though. 

I'm not saying his tactics have been flawless. He's annoyed me quite a bit (mainly since the new year) with who he's decided to play etc. 

As for Public Relations... well I actually respect him for how he's been. He's stuck up for his team and players which is what you want from a manager. He doesn't care if it makes himself look bad (I personally don't think he has really) with his no bullshit approach. He makes many fair points about how the media like to stir things for headlines. 

And lets not forget he's had to do all this with us missing our most important player (Lucas) for most of the season and Gerrard and Adam (not as bad as people make him out to be) being out for significant amount of times too. 

He's got us European football back (albeit Europa League) at the first time of asking by way of our first trophy for 6 years. I know you say the players are already motivated for Cup games without any help from the manager but then why haven't they won (and reached another final) a cup in so many years under previous managers?

I just think he deserves longer to prove himself. This has been a transition period for the club. You can't expect instance results. ",0,1337132200,null,0,false,0,c4oj5u3,t3_to5zm,t1_c4oj5u3,t1_c4ofao0,null,1428933508,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

And then when we got to Parliament Square we were let in but not out again, which built up crush and a nice head of steam for some. And once I had managed to talk my way out a couple of hours later a bunch of riot police swept down Whitehall beating people that were leaving and any passers-by back into what was now a riot.

Jim Moriarty was not a lesser man.  The shadows aren’t scary once you own them.

“What I find fascinating is how a man of your power and position has turned to me for help.  The risk of even having this meeting to you personally, not that I am trying to dissuade you at all I’m more than happy to do as you have asked for such a generous payment but imagine if the press found this out.  The scandal.”

“It does not concern me.”  The reply came with the same underlying level of confidence that the entire conversation had, normally with these deals the other party wavers here or there revealing little things.  Weaknesses, chinks in their armour.

The gentlemen stood before him half in shadow spoke with the assurance of a man who knew his own future almost.  Moriarty felt nearly bothered.

“I have brought only myself and what would I have to gain from leaking to the press of my meetings with the criminal element.  As for you, you trust the people you have brought and none of them would be stupid enough to double cross you.  No evidence of anyone who has, has ever been found”, the voice from the shadows paused letting that last thought echo around the room so that all attentive ears would hear it “and you are a smart man, a man with many connections.  You hear things.”

The man stepped forwards into the dim light.  Somehow he seemed even more menacing now despite his slight frame.

“You know Mr Moriarty that I wield great power and influence far beyond that which the British public know.  I and my associates can think up some quite extraordinary punishments.”

“I am aware”, Moriarty cut him off “that only a fool would think twice to cross, I know quite what you are capable of.”  

In truth Moriarty had no clue.  Just rumours.  Ghost stories almost, told by grown men who’d looked death in the face many times and were frightened by what they heard.  What he did know was the shroud of mystery around this man was too great to be ignored, such a challenge.

“Rest assured everything will proceed as planned and no-one will ever know of your involvement.” Moriarty bowed a little.  The thought of acting subservient to someone sickened him but he swiftly reminded himself of the eventual payoff to this sycophantic behaviour.

“Good.  After all death and mayhem on this scale is hardly toeing the party line Mr Moriarty.”

“Absolutely Mr Saxon.”

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Doctor Who is Sci Fi is the *loosest* sense of the term. The vast majority of episodes are nothing like traditional science fiction.

Doctor Who is a fantasy, a western, a period drama, a space opera, a swash buckler, a horror, and a comedy. It can be all these things because it's not bound by time or space. It's total freedom.

That said, here are some episodes (in order, mind you. Watch them in order) that are the least like traditional science fiction **in bold are the most like fantasy** *in itallics are ones that are less like fantasy, but are still great*:

* **The Unquiet Dead (Charles Dickens and ghosts)**

* Dalek (Not really fantasy, but it's a more personal adventure that doesn't focus on science)

* **Father's Day (Vicious bat-like creatures from the edges of time act as baddies, but this episodes all about time and death)**

* **The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (Brilliant episode, not very sicency if you think about it. Brilliant themes of horror)**

* *Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways (Plot important episode. Make sure to watch this one)*

* *The Christmas Invasion (Tribal creatures invade Earth by controlling the blood of humans)*

* **Tooth and Claw (Werewolves!)**

* **School Reunion (Essentially vampires)**

* *The Girl in the Fireplace (Clockwork men stalk Revolutionary France)*

* Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel (Plot important, also alright episode)

* **The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit (Satan!)**

* *Army of Ghosts/Doomsday (Plot important, also good)*

* *The Runaway Bride (Plot important, also good)*

* *Smith and Jones (Not very sciency, plot important)*

* **The Shakespeare Code (Witches!)**

* Gridlock (Plot important, not very sciency)

* 42 (A firey death posses members of a ship. Not very sciency)

* **Human Nature/Family of Blood (*Very* not sciency, a period peice of sorts)**

* **Blink (Weeping Angels! One of the series best, you may want to start with this to whet your friend's appetite)**

* Utopia/The Sound of Drums/The Last of the Time Lords (Plot important)
 
* *Partners in Crime (Brilliantly hilarious episode. Seriously, enjoy this one.)*

* **The Fires of Pompeii (A Grecian cult of psychics want to silence warnings of the city's upcoming destruction)**

* Planet of the Ood (A peaceful race of slaves finally have their mysteries unwraveled)

* **Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (Shadows eat flesh)**

* *Turn Left (Plot important, brilliant, not very sciency)*

* *The Stolen Earth/Journey's End (plot important, finale)*

* The Waters of Mars (It's a bit sciency, but very good)

* *The End of Time Parts 1&amp;2 (plot important, other finale)*

* *The Eleventh Hour (Plot important, very fun)*

* Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone (Plot important, also Angels)

* **Vampires in Venice (Oh, what could be in this one?)**

* Amy's Choice (All about dreams)

* *Vincent and the Doctor (Not sciency at all, rather good)*

* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang (plot important)

* **A Christmas Carol (it's a Christmas Carol. Also, the best special of Doctor Who, IMHO.)**

* The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon (Rubbish, but plot important)

* *The Doctor's Wife (A living Planet and the TARDIS gets a body)*

* The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People (plot important, also good)

* A Good Man Goes to War (rubbish but plot important)

* Let's Kill Hitler (total shit, but plot important)

* **Night Terrors (I don't like it, but it's very fantasy-ish)**

* **The God Complex (Minotaur, rooms that hold fears)**

* *Closing Time (because it's brilliant)*

* The Wedding of River song (plot important)

true,ax4of9,null,null,"So you agree that he has poor management skills, that Aquilani was a poor buy (even though it might or might not be forced by circumstances), and that he did not perform very well in interviews. Kenny wearing the Suarez t-shirt is comparable in the terms that it was a similar debacle, but the circumstances were that the player, and the club, was coming under immense pressure for a case that was eventually never conclusively proven. (By conclusively proven, I mean that it was beyond reasonable doubt.) Rafa's ""meltdown"" was down to purely football matters. 

So let's get to the crux of the matter: Why I chose Martinez over Rafa. I'll tell you first why I don't want Rafa: because he will bring with him pressure and expectations. People will look at him as the guy who brought us the Champions League, FA Cup and a 2nd placing in the league and expect him to do the exact same thing with a squad that isn't ready for that. The media will be on his case all the time, repeating all the gaffes from his first reign over and over again. They will raise expectations sky high and watch him fall. 

If our team has shown one thing this season, it's that there is next to no confidence. All the pressure that Rafa brings along will not help with their confidence. It will make it worse. Also, what if Rafa doesn't do well after a year? We'll end up with the same moral dillema as we do now with Kenny. There will be people calling for his head, pointing to his failure at Inter and saying that we're letting his past glories cushion his failures. And there will be people saying we should give him more time based on all that he has achieved with the club. It will be Dalglish 2.0. 

Why Martinez over Rafa? Because he doesn't come with any pressure. No one will look at him and expect him to win the title. I strongly believe that our squad played well this year, but had poor results. This means that without extenuating circumstances, it will be difficult for Liverpool to end up in a worse position next year. Maybe not Top 4, but at least Top 6, and this is with the current squad. Martinez will likely be able to improve on our league position without people (media and fans alike) expecting him to pluck the moon from the sky. 

By the way, choosing Martinez over Rafa by no means imply that I want him as our next manager. It is my firmest belief that Dalglish should be, and will be, in charge for another season. No more than that. He will possibly even bring us to Top 4, but he is not our manager for the conceivable future. By the end of next season, he will only have 1 year of his contract left, which basically means it's time to end his reign and bring in someone new. The squad took last year to settle. Next year will be one where they need to, and rightfully should, perform at a respectable level. This means that whoever takes over from him at the end of next season will have a relatively stable squad of players who are comfortable playing with each other, one where he does not need to make wholesale changes and only needs to improve in bits and pieces. 

However, as I told devineman yesterday when he asked me who I would choose if I **had** to, a realistic choice would be to promote Steve Clarke to manager and put in Carra as a player/coach. This allows for continuity in our squad and football. A dream appointment will be Klopp, but this will not be possible until the 2013/2014 season.

Seeing as every time the Doctor's regenerated he's not been in control (all of his regenerations have been unwillingly activated due to bodily harm) and he has consistently become male each and every time it's difficult to say if he even *could* become female. Yes, Eleven panics ""I'm a girl!"" in Eleventh Hour, but he was delusional at the point and didn't even know who he was, hardly a sober source.

Things go bad with Hodgson, so people begin to demand that Kenny is brought back.

Kenny fails to deliver after 1.5 seasons, now people want Rafa back.

What happens if Rafa fails? Are people going to try and resurrect Shankly?

Now is a time of moving forward, not backwards. People seem to forget that Rafa had his problems, too. People see the silverware and assume that it was all brilliant, but the fact is that it wasn't. It will be easy to place all the blame with Gillette and Hicks, but the situation is far more complicated than that and Rafa has some fault in the state of the team he left. 

Winning the CL in his first season was an outstanding achievement, but 12 months later almost every single one of those players was gone. He was able to strengthen the side, though, most would agree, but he also made some terrible transfers. When the owners insisted that he would have to sell players in order to buy new ones, things went completely off the rails. He sold the wrong players and replaced them with even worse ones.

Some of the stories are amazing and interesting, even if they are thousands of years old.  In fact, the thousands of years make it even more interesting!  There are large sections dedicated to a ""law"", but the new testament says it needs to be understood in a certain way - so the bible actually says that we should not be killing people for those sort of things.  So we don't ignore those passages, but the bible explicitly says they're not for now.

&gt;Now if you relate in a moral sense, then I can understand that (for the new testament) but in terms of being able to apply a lot of the lessons to modern life?

I relate in a moral sense for both the old and the new testament.  Basically the lessons we have to apply are to do with how we relate with each other, and how we relate to God.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; Suggested that theres an argument that a rogue officer who ""went native"" was acting as an agitator.

A rogue officer?  Really?

""A seventh undercover officer, Simon Wellings, was exposed by Newsnight in March. **All seven spies shared similar modi operandi: they appeared out of nowhere, often had access to vehicles and showed an unflinching willingness to help run the logistics of protest organisation.** Unlike undercover officers who penetrate serious criminal gangs, typically for no more than a few weeks or months, agents deployed in protest organisations are authorised to spend years living double lives as campaigners. ""

If someone suggested that the police were infiltrating protest groups, sending people undercover for years at a time, they'd be called a conspiracy theorist.

If someone suggested that those undercover police officers were providing the vehicles and logistics expertise to actually aid the protest rather than simply observe, they'd be called a conspiracy nutter.

If someone suggested these officers had sexual relations with protestors in direct contravention to undercover rules, meaning their handlers were also ""rogue"", the claim would be laughed at.

If someone then suggested the evidence collected by these officers would be withheld in order to secure unsafe convictions, meaning that senior officers and the CPS must have also gone rogue along with the handlers and the undercover officers, then the person making such a claim must be on a one way trip to the looney bin.

I have no idea whether MI5 or ACPO or the Met employ provecteurs on protests. I've seen some interesting youtube footage but nothing that completely convinces me.

~~As I understand it, from [here](http://www.hansonwealth.co.uk/policefed/pps/pension.html) and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11446830), under the scheme that closed for entry in 2006, police could retire at age 50, after 30 years work, having paid in 1/60th, and then later 2/60th of their salary each year, to receive a guaranteed pension at 2/3rds of their final salary.~~ 

~~I mean, what can you say? They were basically paying in 2-3% of their salary for thirty years, and then receiving back 66% of their salary for however long they live after 50, which you'd expect to be about 25 years. That is genuinely insane.~~

~~The post-2006 scheme does seem slightly less mad, but that is not saying much.~~

Edit: As an aside, you can see details of the other grievances [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/18018990).

Edit 2: Really, that scheme is not a contributions-funded pension, it a method of deferred payment of wages. Or in other words, a way for the government to have staff now, but transfer the cost of employing them onto the next generation. The Unions are happy because of employment goodies, the government is happy because it can spend its budget elsewhere, the elderly are happy because someone else is picking up the tab, and everyone else gets squeezed.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"You make a good point about the added pressure, many of our current players are mentally weak, both cup finals showed this, we really should have beat Cardiff comfortably in the cup and we had the jitters against Chelsea. 

We need a team thats mentally tough and can handle this pressure, perhaps Benitez's (are any high profile manager for that matter) added presure could expose the mentally weak players and give us a good idea of where we need to improve, thats what would ideally happen but its by no means a guarantee, it could completely backfire and, like you said, make things worse. If Kenny stays or Benitez (or anyone else) comes in, the pressure next season is going to be increased regardless. Even Kenny staying could have more pressure than if Benitez came in, the owners goal this season was top four, if Kenny doesn't get it next season heads are going to roll, he'll be sacked along with the coaching team and depending on how the season goes it could harm his reputation, just look at Souness, absolute legend of the club but whenever his name is mentioned people immmediately think of his time as manager (bit extreme example I know and everybody loves Kenny, but it's a possibility)

I'm not trying to say anything you've mentioned is wrong, any managers a risk and brings their own positive and negative aspects to a team. You make some good points but I just simply think choosing Martinez would be a huge gamble over choosing Rafa. If Rafa could end up being Dalglish 2.0, then Martinez has every chance of being Hodgson 2.0, he's flavour of the month currently due to Wigans performances towards the end of the season and that is the only reason he has been linked to the job, Hodgson was in a similar situation when he got Fulham to the Europa league final.

As for someone else besides Rafa, I don't get to watch too much of the Bundesliga so I can't say much about Klopp, but based off his record and what I hear about him, I wouldn't be unhappy at all with his appointment. Another appointment I wouldn't be unhappy with is Villas-Boas, his time at Porto was impressive. He's young and would bring fresh ideas to the team, he tried to instill these ideas at Chelsea but he was treated unfarily by trigger-happy Roman and seemed to be undermined by the more senior players of the squad.

true,Sell200AprilAt142,english,"England (Liverpool, City of London, Bournemouth)","Not quite.  It's a muddled thought but it comes from the fact that public sector workers receive their salary from the treasury and also pay taxes back to that treasury.  They might as well not pay income tax at all and have their salary reduced by the equivalent amount.  It would make no net difference to either the treasury (down the same amount each month) or the worker (up the same amount each month).  So public sector workers don't contribute to the burden via income tax.

e.g. why pay someone £10 regularly and expect them to give you back £2 each time when you should just readjust the payment to £8?

That's not to say they don't contribute to the economy, of course they do, they provide essential services, infrastructure etc.  But the _value_ of their contribution is much harder to pin down.  Some public work aids wealth creating business (e.g. roads etc) and so those public workers' contribution is realised in the profits of every business that made use of the roads to generate wealth.  Other public workers do not (e.g. elderly care).

I imagine public workers are kept as tax payers mainly to

However it does have to be admitted that some of the roundabouts were getting into difficulties at peak times coping with very high levels of traffic.

-most of the media pressure last season came from the racist incident. We are unlikely to see the same amount of attention next season with Kenny.

-pressure about his job might galvanize the players to better performances. Many of our players are great fans of Kenny. Gerrard practically idolises him. 

-sacking Kenny immediately gives us added media attention about how we didn't give one of the greatest heroes at the club enough time. 

-Rafa didn't have a good relationship with the media the last time he was here. 

-Gerrard and Carragher dislike Rafa. I doubt many of our veterans like him very much. 

-choosing Martinez over Rafa was a forced choice. I chose him cos he comes with a clean slate and is underrated. Rafa will definitely come with baggage. 

-Martinez is also young. Someone young and hungry suits our owners better. 

-my most realistic scenario remains to keep Clarke as manager, then promote Carragher to be player/coach. It gives us stability while having a clean slate. 

-the best case scenario will still be to keep Kenny for another year then have him retire at the end of the season no matter what. Kenny doesn't need a career in football, he's done very well the last 10+ years outside of it. 

-Klopp plays the same way we should be playing. Lewandowski knocks the ball down for a fluid attacking force of Kagawa and Goetze. He is good at getting the best out of players while having a good relationship with them. A non-robotic, friendly version of Rafa if you will.

E.g. public road construction is given £10million to buy materials and produces roads that enable business to complete £20million more of business.  In this case the public road workers were _enablers_ and acted just like a wealth creating business.  They spent X but increased overall trade by 2X.

The truth is that the private sector pays its taxes into the treasury, but some portion of those taxes were due to the work performed by the public sector.  The argument is over how much.  E.g. do public nurses doing 24-hour elderly care contribute to the economy.  Well.  If you want to look short, no they don't.  Their time and effort is spent on someone not economically active.  But if you take the long view, they are; most people would find it hard to live and work in a country that let old people wither away and starve to death on the street.

In principle I agree we need to separate retail and investment banking.  But in practice I don't think we can.

As I see it, retail banks are meant to provide a place to keep your monthly pay check until it is spent, to let you buy a pension or get a mortgage and to maybe give you a credit card or an unsecured loan and things like that?  And if one were to be allowed to fail it would mean chaos for the customers as their pensions vanished or their house was re-possessed even though they were making their payments or cash card stopped working.

The problem is that most of us are deep in debt.  Our mortgages outweigh our savings and pensions, our credit cards are maxed out on pay day and we use the salary not for the expenses but to bring the balance back to zero so we can spend another month putting everything on the card.

Now this is an oddly sensible way to live because it tends to make people more productive.  Getting a car loan to buy a car to go to work is better than sitting on your arse right?  Better for you, better for your new employer, better for the tax man, better for the guy lending you the money.  So credit is good, at least when used to make/save us money.

But then that brings the big question:  Where the fuck is all the money coming from?  If my mortgage is not being covered by 10 other people's savings/pension pots where does the money come from to pay for the house I bought?

The answer is investment banks.  We get a lot of cash from places like Saudi Arabia and China and they pass it over to pay for mortgages and collect the repayments.

So if we let investment banks fail we loose access to those funds, at least for a while.  So although current accounts will still ""work"", mortgages will become unavailable and interest will rocket, the same on credit cards and car loans and 100 other things.

So even with total separation the conditions would not be tolerable for most people.

What we need is better balance in the world economy.  Nations like China and India need to stop over producing and we in the west need to stop over consuming.  But try selling that to the public.  At the same time we need to persue things like energy independence because the number one nations with cash piles are places that do nothing but export oil.  When you look at the nations that fared best post the crash it is nations with a balanced economy, neither big borrowers nor lenders.  Places like Canada with a mixed domestic economy (some services, some manufacture, some oil).  That is what we need.

But then that would require long term planning, sacrifice and the acceptance of no more booms...

&gt;Student loans demo Dec 2010, escort for my nephew to keep him out of trouble.

       ""1.10pm: We have the first skirmishes between 
        marchers and police, minor stuff so far. TV footage
        shows shoving matches between protesters – who are 
        seemingly trying to break away from the main route and 
        escape possible kettling – and yellow-vested officers. 
        In another context it would be known, I believe, as 
        'handbags'.

        1.46pm: 1.39pm: Esther Addley is biding her time by 
        parliament, and sends in a photo of lots of police doing 
        the same:

        2.15pm: An email from one marcher, Simon:  Protesters 
        broke down the barrier into the green of Parliament Square.
        There are now literally hundreds of police approaching. 
        At the back we are not quite sure where to go.

Hint: don't go where they are breaking down barriers.  They who are doing so, or those that are supporting it are breaking the law and constitute illegal protest.

        2.33pm: There's lots of shoving against the barriers on 
        Parliament Square, with a few placards being thrown, 
        TV pics show. The pic here was tweeted.

Even shoving the barriers is illegal and attempting to break route.  The organisers have an obligation to try and stop this but the law understands that this may not be within the ability and they are not obliged to put themselves at risk.  This is now turning into an illegal protest.

        2.37pm: Polly Curtis, watching from the Commons, says 
        she saw the centre of Parliament Square taken over in a 
        matter of moments. She's tweeted one photo of a 
        near-empty square, and another taken just three minutes later.

It's still illegal, still no kettling.

        2.58pm: It seems there is at least one idiot on the march. 
        Adam Gabbatt tweets to say:  This was just thrown into 
        the crowd beside me. Thankfully didn't hit anyone. 
        It's heavy.  In case you can't see the small crop of the 
        photo very well, it's some sort of large industrial battery.

Walk away!  At this stage you shouldn't be there but the crowd is escalating it.


        3.20pm: I've just had a very noisy chat with Adam Gabbatt
        from Parliament Square where – brave lad – he was just a 
        few metres from the police lines as some marchers threw
        placards and missles and tried to break through. 

If you're in that crowd you're now part of an illegal protest.  If they are coming under attack and barriers are bing broken they are going to have to kettle soon.

        3.29pm:   However, there have been some isolated 
        skirmishes, mainly protesters using barriers to try and 
        force back police lines. Some placards and flares have 
        been thrown.   Scotland Yard says that so far there has 
        been just one arrest (for drunk and disorderly) and no 
        reported injuries, though both could change.  Police have
        seemingly not been able to contain marchers as they had 
        hoped. A large nunber have spilled onto the green of 
        Parliament Square, painting a giant ""No"" in red paint.

        3.45pm: Ladies and gentlemen, we have our kettle. 
        Esther Addley has telephoned in to say police in 
        Parliament Square confirmed to her that a ""containment"" 
        (their term) is in place. They add: ""This is due to the 
        level of violence that our officers are facing."" 
        They won't say how long it might be in place.

No shit Sherlock!

So at 2:15 they broke down the barriers going off the official route, at 2:33 they started pushing against police barriers, at 2:58 the police are being attacked and the crowd is turning, at 3:29 there have been skirmishes with objects thrown but still there has only been one arrest, and only at 3:45 was the kettle introduced.

An hour and a half after the protest turned illegal, and 45 minutes after the police were starting to be attacked in earnest was a kettle introduced.  You attended an illegal protest and you're a terrible chaperone.  I said you were either an arrogant or an ignorant minority and I'd tell you which.  It sounds like you were ignorant as to what happened.  You had an hour and a half to get out of dodge once it turned illegal before they introduced the kettle.

40,000 people attended the protests that day.  40,000 people weren't kettled.

I'm happy Carroll is in. He's young, in form and could be important to England in the future. Crouch has shown he can do it before so he's unlucky, but I think it might be a bit much for Holt. G. Johnson should be in, but I'd have Richards over Jones. Having Jones provides cover for CB if required too though so I can see why.

Again, Henderson can play CM and wide right (although not to great effect as we have seen) so maybe Hodgson is looking for versatility out of a small squad. The squad does lack a central playmaker though, such as Scholes or Carrick.

Downing can only be in because he's naturally left footed. I'd have found room for Lennon somehow myself to play on the right. A. Johnson is the one to have missed out because of Downing, and he hasn't been great this year either, he tends to run down blind alleys.

If it's the latter, I would suggest having a very serious talk with her. She is not in the position to ""allow"" you to do anything. Just because you live together doesn't mean she can dictate what you can and can't do. She can ask you not to watch the show when she is around, but if it's something that is important to you, she needs to recognize that. A relationship isn't supposed to be one-sided, and if you are genuinely upset that she won't ""allow"" you to watch Doctor Who, you need to talk to her and let her know your needs aren't being met.

It's not like I was saying Timelords shouldn't be able to change gender because it's wrong and that everybody is the gender they are born, no exceptions. I was just saying that changing a character's gender after 50 years is a fucking horrible idea.

If the Doctor was a real person, I wouldn't have any problem with him regenerating in to a woman. But he's not. He's a fictional character created for our entertainment. Restricting him to a single gender isn't being oppressing, sexist, or transphobic, it's about good writing. The writers have to attempt to make us believe that a character who has been played by 11 different actors spanning 50 years is the same character, and not 11 different characters. Changing genders would easily be the thing that splits ""The Doctor"" from all the other Doctors, ruining the illusion in a big, ugly, TV-show-cancelling mess.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"You weren't there then and are relying on the Guardian. Yet you are going to tell me what I saw and insult me in the process? Wow. 

Before I start though, a brief word on the nephew situation. He was going to the demo anyway, regardless of what adults said. If I didn’t go with him he was going with his friends, which I judged to be too risky. Better to have me with him and a few years’ experience than his idiot mates. So please stop jumping to conclusions.

I am not going to argue with the timeline, I don’t doubt its broad accuracy, but it is partial in what it covers. Here is my take on the day.

An officially declared kettle at 3.45pm and police attempting to block and contain protesters are very similar things, the difference being just the name. In fact as your quote said, people were trying to escape ‘possible kettling’ at 1.10. At sometime before 2pm our section of the march was approaching the junction of Horse Guards and Great George St. There was no aggression or trouble and it was on the official route. This was out of sight of any trouble in Parliament Square and people seemed unaware of any events there. Police blocked the route just inside Great George St and appeared to be attempting to encircle (a kettle in effect if not designation) the march at that point. The crowd flooded backwards faster than they could encircle us and we spread out into St James’ Park (my mistake earlier, I said Green Park, they are right next to each other and I always thought it was just one park). To avoid further blocks we went round side roads into Parliament Square, so yes by that point we had been driven off the official route. Mounted police allowed us into Parliament Square and no trouble was apparent at the point where we entered. It turned out that this was after the barriers onto the Green had been broken down but police were still letting people into what you describe as being by this point an ‘illegal protest’. 

The description of events in in the square seems reasonably accurate, there were large numbers of people milling around aimlessly, with nowhere to go, some were dancing to sound systems and a growing number were having a rumble with the Met. The nice mounted police that had let us in were by this time riding their horses backwards and forwards at an angry crowd who were pushing and shoving back, or vice versa, so I concentrated on checking exits and teaching the neph what to look out for, to stay aware of potential flashpoints and to always have somewhere to run to get out of the way. Other exits out of the square were held by police lines the whole time, well before any official kettle was declared. After an hour or two standing around the kettle was made official and being stuck became being officially stuck. Sometime after that I showed the neph that talking to a policeman one-on-one with a calm, polite middle class accent can be a very useful skill and we got out of the kettle onto Whitehall. After a cup of coffee at Trafalgar Square he wanted to see if anything was happening before we got our train. We went down Whitehall as far as the MOD building and could see flames and police in Parliament Square so stopped. Google maps puts us at least 280m from any trouble. There were tourists and passersby wandering about, as well as a few people leaving the demo, but no trouble. As we retreated a line of riot police appeared across Whitehall between us and Trafalgar Square and charged towards us wielding batons and shields and driving everyone back towards the riot, which seemed bizarre. Instead of running in the direction they were driving people we moved sideways fast which got us over a fence, a wall and down a side street without being assaulted or forced back into the kettle.

So does that agree with your internet facts and conclusions?

Oh, by the way, one last thing. Another internet fact. No MPs in kettles you say? [How about this one](http://www.liberator.org.uk/article.asp?id=167304099), kettled on the same day that Ian Tomlinson was assaulted by a police officer and died.

No, it wouldn't. You a) can't and b) wouldnt frak near a site suitable for nuclear waste.

&gt;Plus, seagull crap in Sellafield is radioactive

Basically horse shit, there is a low risk and steps have been actively taken to reduce any risk from wildlife. 

The thing is we don't have better alternatives. Nuclear is vital as part of a mixed range of energy sources. Renewables arent reliable enough and provide energy at all the wrong times (when it is hot, during the day etc) and does it unreliably at that. If we wanted to really depend on them we also need to invest in very large scale energy storage which shoots cost way way up or we have the lights go out when we need them. Renewables will make up a large proportion of energy production but by no means all and fossil fuels on a large scale arent acceptable.

If you are not here for very long then it is a great way to see the city and the guides will usually be able to offer you both the normal tourist spiel (which is usually interesting) as well as their personal thoughts on what to do and see

I would strongly suggest going on a ghost tour, edinburgh is famous for them, I am slightly biased as I work on one but I still think they are one of the best things to do. I always put friends and family on one of our tours when they come up here. 
I work for the Cadies and witchery tours and could not recomend them more if you want a lighthearted tour of spooky edinburgh.
Mercat tours also offers a really good service, they tend to offer a slightly scarier/ more serious experience so if thats what you are looking for then go for them. 

As for pubs there are loads but the 'last drop' on Edinburgh's grassmarket is one of our favourites. They do some decent beer and whiskey and the bar tenders are just grumpy enough to make it an awesome little place. 

As i said I am slightly biased but tours are one of the best ways to see the city. They show you loads of back alleys and provide some wicked stories that make the old town so much more interesting.

In terms of ghost tour you have a few options:

- Mercat tours: One of the longest running, serious/scary historical presentation
- Cadies and witchery tours: Another of longest running, light hearted/funny + historical (with jumper outer to scare you)
- Old Reekie: underground/ scary. Avoid, terrible tour
- Burke and hare free tour: run by an odd little man, like his storytelling style but not best tour (expect to tip)
- City of the dead: (not sure)

Based on living here and working as a tour guide thats best overview i can offer

But there's very few natural left-footed wingers about to challenge him from the spot.

Glen Johnson is getting a lot of unwarranted hate. I assume from people who haven't actually seen how well he's played this season. Pretty sure I read that statistically he is this seasons best English RB. I do think Richards should have been included ahead of Phil Jones though. 

I'm most annoyed about John Terry getting into the squad. Even taking away the fact he's utter scum as a person I don't think he's had a great season. Far too many mistakes costing his team. Would have taken Rio or Jagielka over him. 

Bit wary about Oxlade-Chamberlain going. Could be too much for him at his age. And I though Walcott was injured? Would maybe have picked Lennon, Adam Johnson or even Nathan Dyer over them. 

Would have liked to have seen Grant Holt or Crouchy get one of the strikers positions. Crouchy because I just like him (and has had a decent season with Stoke), Holt because of the amount of goals he's had this season. Celtic's Gary Hooper could also have been a contender.

* FSG needed a figure to steer the ship out of the darkness of the previous regime and Kenny Dalglish did this.
* However it is quite common for new ownership to find their ""own guys.""
* The quick/easy decision is bring in a legend to manage the club for as long as possible but - hindsight is 20/20 - the writing was on the wall when a lot of LFC execs were clearing house.
* The key - and this to me is *essential* - is to find a Director of Football and a manager (who are effective and can work together) as **quickly** as possible, no need for this to drag out deep into the summer when we have so much work to do.

Now... on a more personal note:

* I love Kenny Dalglish, he will always be a legend at Liverpool FC and I hope FSG will treat his dismissal/resignation with class.
* Dalglish, I hope, will still be part of LFC in some way.
* In spite of a frustrating up/down season, we won a Carling Cup.

But yes, mostly people are fine.

In fact there once was a time when the megabus was positively luxurious. About 10 years ago they used to run a Leeds/Manchester service that no-one appeared to know about. It cost a quid and there were several times when I was the only passenger. I used to sit up front with driver and get mega pissed on the M62 (the driver was always remarkably sound about that... They're not so alcohol friendly these days). Eventually they got wise to this and stopped that service but it was great while it lasted. Ahhh... The Golden Age of the Megabus.

If you can, try to avoid services that stop at Birmingham airport because it's a totally pain in the arse that adds about an hour to the journey for the sake of the one person who gets off there.

I'd argue that but fine lets use the words humanism and rationalism instead.

&gt;Secondly, we learn about the Bible in schools because it is part of our history and cultural heritage. We also learn about other religions, which is great too.

Then why not simply learn the religious history of Britain, there's nothing about the Middle Eastern parables in the Bible that relates to British history, the interpretation of those parables by others and how it affected their lives and influence their decisions - those in Britain, and possibly Europe - is what we should study.

Kids TV is so full of mindless rubbish, with the exception of the odd interesting drama and the occasional magazine show. Blue Peter has an opportunity (saying a responsibility is a bit daft, although I bet some would say that the BBC has a responsibility) to provide education; not the kind you get in schools.

Blue Peter used to travel the world, and open children's eyes to interesting and unusual things. What the content was wasn't the point, but the type of thinking and the thirst for exploration/knowledge of the new that it communicated and encouraged was very important. It was a window which showed that the world and its people are varied in many different ways, and that we aren't all here in pebbledash houses.

Add to that charity appeals, which while sometimes greatly successfull in raising money, made children think about issues, and want to do something about them. The same thing was encouraged with things like wildlife surveys, and science reports/discussions. Kids were invited and encouraged to get out of the house, for a reason. The reason might be that there were fewer worms than last decade, but an afternoon digging for bugs makes a good change from Call of Duty and Dick and Dom shitting on each other, or whatever they do.

Viewers were encouraged to get involved, writing in letters for the presenters to ask guests, show off artwork etc. And the Blue Peter Badge, an exclusive club entered upon undertaking a task of skill or alturism.

Sure, a Carling cup is great, but it isn't enough to displace a eight-place finish. 

I wouldn't have minded seeing him have at least another half a season to get the team back on the track, but it just wasn't in the cards.

&gt;Then why not simply learn the religious history of Britain, there's nothing about the Middle Eastern parables in the Bible that relates to British history, the interpretation of those parables by others and how it affected their lives and influence their decisions - those in Britain, and possibly Europe - is what we should study.

Because these cultures remain very strong, and active today. It is important that people know how to engage with them. Students essentially learn about humanism in PSHE, which is all about engaging with your community, other people, and basically making sure they're not a total failure with a bit of ethics, and sexual health thrown in too. I argue this because the premise of humanism is to essentially be a worthwhile human being. Which is great.

Students also practice rationalism daily through mathematics and sciences.

&gt; I'd be happy to quote passages

and im sure you could. However as Atheism is as mentioned, a ""lack of a belief"" rather than a belief, the nature of Atheist books are purposefully critical of religion. Religious texts tend to promote the interests of their own religion, and whilst this isn't perfect, it is important we have understanding of contemporary religions.

Lastly, to suggest that most cultures aren't entirely based around religion is pretty disingenuous. I mean, I'm an Atheist, but I identify as a Cultural Catholic because of, well, everything about my family life.",0,1337187038,null,0,false,0,c4orp5n,t3_tosi7,t1_c4orp5n,t1_c4orfzl,null,1428937615,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ideal signings this summer - A right back (Van Der Wiel), and another winger (Hulk, Lavezzi) we have already signed Marko Marin but another one is needed

Time Lords used to have 13 lives."" In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate ""507"" times. Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations.[10] Writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary.

Just a quick google shows that this ""Sputum Test"" the author reveres could be one of a couple of things - microscopy or culture.  Microscopy would be positive in some 60% of patients that will go on to grow TB from their sputum (more likely to be positive in severe infections), but growth from sputum would take up to 8 weeks.

Essentially a large aircraft carrier should be used like an airfield, to launch heavily loaded otherwise (relatively) conventional warplanes against the enemy. The F-18, Mig29, and most other naval fast jets can only operate from these vessels. It means having a big ship, because even with a catapult, these are fairly conventional aircraft. It allows for cheaper planes which are also ultimately just better, though.

Our last carriers were rather small, so we used Harriers which were smaller [STOVL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOVL) aircraft, they carried less of everything and were lighter and smaller, but could take off from a really short runway and land verticaly. Great for a small ship, but nowhere near as capable as the sorts of things you launch away with CATOBAR ships.

Essentially, if we're not using cats and traps, and we're instead just going to use another STOVL aircraft, there's not much point in having these huge carriers. The 20,000 tonne Invincibles carried about 20 harriers, along with their various helicopters. If we're only buying 50 STOVL aircraft, then having 65,000 tonne carriers is really a bit pointless.

*""Dear Sir/Madam, 

I found the comments of your contributor to the discussion of the suspected murder of 6 children in Derby on the This Morning Show beyond repulsive.  That you would employ someone to air such savagely insensitive remarks about the death of children in what is being viewed by the Police Constabulary as a multiple murder is shocking to me.  

Who produced this?  Who edited it? Who was the floor manager that allowed someone to make such a series of offensive and senseless remarks on live television?  

You will know of course, that this is already all over the internet, and that that means that the mainstream media are just about to pick up on it.  

This is the death of 6 kids that we are talking about here.  One or more of the individuals on your staff thought that it was acceptable to give air to these poisonous remarks by Ms. Malone. 

What were you thinking?  

Was there no-one in the office, or on the floor that thought, "" this isn't alright?"".    If there wasn't then you need you have a big deep look into your heart and ask where you career in TV went so wrong.  

6 children died in a suspected crime.  And you gave airtime to a woman who believes that ""this was an accident waiting to happen"", apparently because the family was on benefits. 

It's not Malone's fault.  Everyone with half a brain knows that she's a semi-literate bigot.  But you guys?   Really?   

Who produced this? Who booked her?  The buck's gotta stop somewhere?  

To their credit, the presenter's of the show looked appalled.  

Is there any chance that anyone will be brought to account for taking charge of a piece of ordure like this?  

Perhaps the series producer or commissioning editor could reply? 


Is this what you got into television for?

Most Promising Youngster- Lucas Piazon

Best Moment of the Season- Ivanovic goal at home vs. Napoli to seal the match

Worst Moment of the Season- Getting throttled by Arsenal, 3-5

Ideal Signings This Summer- Hulk (striker), Modric (midfielder), Van Der Wiel or some other player from South America that I don't know about (defensive cover at RB)

As for your understanding of what the budget was, how it was funded and who made the decisions on target, im laughin my arse off.  The guy they employed for 'his vision and talent at spotting value in players' negotiated the deals.

You may think the sun shines out of their arses but I certainly dont.

Police officer he was sitting in the left lane doing exactly 40 so I was breaking the law by overtaking him. He fucking went on some maniac tirade and would not hear 1 bit of sense. I was following 3-4 other cars and we overtook him at a crawl. He must have not like the look of me and my friend or something.

Anyway I've got 6-7  other stories where I feel I was mistreated by the police for no good reason. I've never been warned or cautioned or even arrested.

true,Toxication,1986,Frank Lampard,"**Overall Grade**: As other people have said, it really depends on Saturday's result. I'd have to say A if we win it and a C if we don't.  
  
**Best Player**: I'd say Mata for the first half of the season and Ramires for the second half. Since the second half has been more crucial in the defining of the season as a whole, Ramires.  
  
**Worst Player**: Kalou. I just really don't rate him. Never have. Having said that, FloMo hasn't been great either, but I find it hard to hate on him after 09/10.  
  
**Most Improved Player**: Torres or Ramires. Ramires' improvement has been more gradual and under the radar, though, and I don't think he was too bad last season, he just didn't get as many chances to play. So Torres.  
  
**Most Promising Youngster**: Bertrand. He definitely looks like the heir to Ash's throne and the domination of the LB position for Chelsea and England.  
  
**Best Moment of the Season**: Torres' goal against Barca. I've never celebrated a goal like that in my life. It was incredible.  
  
**Worst Moment of the Season**: 'That miss' at Old Trafford. It was awful. I couldn't stop thinking about it, replaying it over and over in my head, thinking ""Why?"". It was like witnessing a traumatic accident. The above 'Best moment' makes up for it, though, and the Barca goal wouldn't've been as satisfying without the miss!  
  
**Ideal Signings This Summer**: Van der Wiel to sort out the rightback problem, Hulk would be fantastic on the wing for us, and Hazard would be the icing on the cake, but it looks like he's City-bound. Truly ideal/dreamworld/not going to happen in a million years would be Ronaldo. How amazing would that be!?

a)  Your link is broken b) an idiotic exception to the rule is hardly evidence contrary to the argument as a whole.

They were breaking police barriers and attacking the police long before kettling was brought into play.  When people are breaking barriers and getting violent the police have an obligation to limit the abuse to protect everyone else.

Megabus is cheaper if you get in really early, but once you're up to around £10 per ticket National Express can be as cheap if you get one of their funfare tickets, which are usually better if you're buying closer to departure date.

I personally won't use Megabus again though, after being screwed by them for 6 hours once when the snow was causing chaos, they managed to send 4 or 5 1/10th full coaches to Cardiff, then at 12:30am tried to say ""come back tomorrow"" when we'd been waiting since 6:30pm. Arriving into Exeter at 5:30am was pretty shit, and the customer ""service"" was a joke. We had no idea what was going on for the whole 6 hours.

That said, my friend won't use National Express for a similar reason, coming home from Reading Festival the bus never appeared, him and about 10 other people were told ""the bus went through, you must have missed it"", then refused to even admit they'd fucked up.

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"**Martinez** would be an enormous gamble.  He had a good run at the end and avoided relegation, I hardly think this is a qualifier for gaffer at LFC.

**Rafa**, I agree, would be moving in the wrong direction and would be seen as a huge gamble by the owners.  The owners already took a gamble with Kenny because if he didn't perform adequately it was never going to be easy letting him go.  Rafa is the same, he has some good history with the club but I doubt the owners will want to risk tarnishing that history and causing more fallout with fans by bringing him back.  

**AVB** is an interesting prospect but if the rumours of him going to Roma are true then there might not be much point discussing this possibility.  I am sure he would love a chance to come back to the PL and prove Abramovich wrong though.  He had what it takes at Porto to win a title but wasn't given time to see out his vision of transformation, nor the support from senior players.  I find it hard to swallow that FSG would want a man who essentially did exactly the same thing as Dalglish did at Chelsea (good in cups, very poor in the league) during his time but with a fresher face.  

**Rodgers** name has been thrown in the mix by sports betting agencies, but other than rumours I haven't heard anything indicating he is looking to leave.  All interviews I have heard with the man seem to indicate otherwise.  He seems like a manager capable to getting the most out of his men which could be exactly what we need.  Seems like a long shot though.

**Steve Nicol** - as someone else mentioned in a different post, he was a former red in the 80s and was at the helm of the MLS team from New England for a decade so is definitely on the FSG radar at least.  That said no European managing experience but he was pretty succesful in the states with the Revolution. 

**Martin O'Neill** a possibility.  Is under contract for another year and a half and has had some success with Sunderland.  

**Other Long Shots:**

* Capello
* Hiddink
* Klopp - under contract until 2014
* Guardiola

Simple distance to market does not reflect the totality of how energy efficient a product is, and people need to consider the overall sustainability of a product assuming they're concerned about the environment/global warming.

There needs to be more transparency and self/peer-regulation otherwise people will just go for the simplistic and potentially counterproductive approach.

In food though, it's not that hard to understand that, buying produce grown in Britain which is unsuited to our climate is likely to be energy inefficient, compared to the same produce grown where it can naturally grow without heating/cooling.  Generally, the more exotic the food, the greater the energy cost.

He said often they would deal with agents and not even reach the player himself, but being a charity that opperated a lot in African countries, a lot of the Premier League's African players were happy to help, and would coordinate everything themselves (he made it sound like they were very respectful and several players were fine giving up an afternoon or two). As they knew he was a gooner, they'd show him some of the private e-mails they recieved from footballers. Some players weren't up for it, and some didn't respond - which is fair enough.

Adebayor APPARENTLY responded to an e-mail himself, but they'd never recieved an answer like it. He was APPARENTLY very short, and asked how much he would be paid for his time......

&gt; Plus, were the police, or at least the met, not confirmed as being institutionally racist a few years back?

The Metropolitan police is one group out of many county police groups. Yes they were reported as institutionally racist, which led to changes being made as far as I know. I'm Northumbria police area, so its a mixture of city and rural, but I haven't experienced nor heard of any racist policing around here. Its more 'oh shit the Newcastle vs Sunderland match is on... bugger.'

&gt; What about the 300 people who have died in custody over the past ten years without hardly a prosecution? 

I guess you're [referring to this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/03/deaths-police-custody-officers-convicted). I don't condone it at all, but it is not a reason for me to not continue with my application, if I can be one of the good ones, then I'm making a difference rather than sitting at home complaining.

&gt; Again, the police have treated the public with contempt for years and you reap what you sow.

I speak from my own experiences when I say I have only had positive dealings. Journalists will glorify things and make things sensationalist. I have a few friends in the police, and they don't condone when things are blatantly wrong.

&gt;You'll remove someone from the protest for being stupid? Under what law exactly? Probably doesn't matter actually, police do do exactly that and then just release them later without charge. Look up what einstein had to say about common sense.

This is just bitterness, really. If you're having a party and someone starts a fight do you just let them continue? No, you kick them out because you don't want them there. In a peaceful protest do you want someone burning a car to make their point? No. As a shop owner trying to just make a living with their trade do you want someone to smash up your shop front 'just because anarchy lol'? No. There's a difference between protest and riot. Riots are when people are super pissed, and require a different style of policing - I agree that some police get a bit carried away at peaceful protests and turn to riot mode... which is wrong. Again, if I can be the change, then good!

Problems in society? There are many, racism, drug abuse (I should qualify this. Recreational, to me, is cool. I'm fine with that, hell, I smoke weed now and then. Drug abuse, to me, is someone stealing to sell and fund their drug habit, these people don't need arresting, they need helping. As police I could (and it has been done before) help channel this person into the appropriate rehab to help them.), general hate crimes, football hooligans (although I'd probably have to avoid this as they just boil my piss), opportunistic thieves, irresponsible drivers (this is where I want to focus, I want to be traffic. I lost a very VERY dear friend in a collision due to a drunk driver, who had stolen a car, and that car owner didn't even have insurance. Triple whammy.).

I think I've put in there how I can see police able to resolve them, the problem I see with the police is that they aren't using their powers properly, what they need to do is channel people into the correct paths for appropriate education. Drug addict? Don't lock them up, get them help. Repeat offender? Don't repeatedly lock them up, get them into some form of education system that is geared around them and motivates them rather than condescends and belittles them. The whole system at the minute is still quite draconian and very 'right, you're nicked. End of' kind-of thing, it needs modernisation.

I hope I haven't come across as a complete tool / dick / cunt to you, as you have sparked a great debate and made me think quite hard!

I watched quite a few of their games and their form was pretty good for a while.  Like us, they were having problems finishing chances but were creating a lot of them.  In the past few months they sorted out that problem and ended up avoiding relegation pretty easily.  They were seven points clear of Bolton... and only nine points behind us.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Let me preface this by saying Huddlestone has been my favorite Spurs player to watch since I started getting interested in football (4 years ago). He's exactly the type of player I admire: nonchalant, elegant, technical, intelligent. Criminally underrated ability. 

**That said, I think there are some real hurdles in his way.**  


-He sort of falls into that category of not quite being a DM and not quite being a playmaker. If his defensive reading of the game improved, I think he could really be an Alonso-esque player for us before his career is done. 

-This is compounded by the fact that he's not the most mobile player in the world. I think this attribute gets overstated at times, but in a two-man midfield (which we predominantly employ) energy and mobility are very important traits. Tom works hard, but he doesn't have that tenacity of someone like Sandro or Parker and doesn't have the agility of Modric. 

-Our game has evolved a bit since his injury issues. I just re-watched the 3-3 Arsenal game from last season and it was staggering just how much of a direct team we were compared to this year. Yes we still mix it up and slam diagonals down the pitch, but not even close to the level we did it last year. In a fast-paced pass and move attack, Huddlestone is not at his best. If anything, he is the type of player to slow a game down and give us some composure. That can be a good thing, but it can also stagnate us. 

-The emergence of Sandro and Livermore means he really needs to impress to start getting games again. Jake Livermore was almost like our Michael Carrick this season. He wins the ball back with positioning and reading the game rather than brute force, and he's a 90+% passer. He started to gain confidence and expand his passing range as the season progressed. If Jake can make that aspect of his game consistent, I'd be worried for Tom. Livermore is already miles ahead in terms of defensive ability, even though he's a few years younger. 

-Building a team around Huddlestone would potentially cripple other aspects of the side. The proposed lineup a bit lower on this page is...troubling. Bale at left back and Modric wide left just to accommodate Huddlestone seems pretty ridiculous to me. But that's the lengths we'd have to go to to protect him. He would need to be paired with an energetic destroyer and a wide midfielder who will drift in to help out. I don't think it's worth it, when we can simply stick Parker or Sandro next to Modders and go to town. We should build our team around our best players. Hudd, again, is perhaps my favorite player to watch, but he is not our best player. It's incredibly difficult to build a team that includes Huddlestone, Modric, VDV, Bale, Lennon, and one of our destroyers in their preferred positions. Shit, probably impossible actually. 

**Solutions**

[Possibility 1](http://this11.com/boards/abCEXA3ahC.jpg) (Sandro and Parker interchangeable)

This gives Huddlestone two things he needs: space and protection. He has energy around him, true wide players to pick out, and ideally lots of time to sit back and read the game and make things happen. Almost sort of a Pirlo style deep-lying playmaker role. 


[Possibility 2](http://this11.com/boards/abCEXGbaom.jpg)

This is our ""if Modric leaves"" option. Personally, I don't like it so much. I think we'd need to replace that dribbler going forward and I'd probably rather see us bring someone in.

That being said, pretty awful that a second person was stabbed (luckily this guy hasn't died) and it seems obvious that that particular area has a problem with violence and 'gangs'. That being said, i think we need to look at the bigger picture here which is summed up nicely in the article:

Yeah this is a terrible incident, but to treat it as a problem with the 'youth' of today (as if they're the only ones going around stabbing people anyway) and not treating this as an isolated problem which isn't indicative of a larger issue is a bad thing to do, at least in my eyes.",0,1337212366,null,0,false,0,c4ox9p4,t3_tqrf0,t1_c4ox9p4,t3_tqrf0,null,1428940224,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Best Player: Toss-up between Ramires and Mata. Mata's been more influential in league games and Ramires has really shone in cup games. I guess since our whole season's success is/will be based on cup results, I'll go with Ramires.

Worst Player: Malouda. I cringe every time he goes on thee field. He just seems like he doesn't know how to work with any of the other players anymore. 

Most Improved Player: Mikel

Most Promising Youngster: Bertrand. I'm excited for Piazon, but I haven't been able to see much of him. Bertrand's played excellently when Cole's out. Definitely a great replacement for LB in the future.

Best Moment of the Season: Torres's goal against Barca. I literally jumped out of my seat and did a few laps around my house screaming at the top of my lungs.

Worst Moment of the Season: I'd have to say giving up that 3 goal lead to Man U. That was just disheartening.

Ideal Signings This Summer: A sort of fuse between Mata and Ramires. Someone who can run up and down the left flank but still be a creative midfielder. Some reinforcement at RB/CB is definitely needed as well.

Uhh... you do realize that Time Lords have *thirteen* lives. I think you're confused because there are twelve regenerations but twelve lives (his first life isn't a regeneration).

&gt; This new doctor is female

Uhh... I would say this is a big enough leap to alienate viewers but you also say later...

&gt; She is however a near total amnesiac, originally thinking herself to be a human companion she even begins looking for the Doctor.

A human companion? What? No really, *what?*

Not only are you suddenly changing the Doctor's gender for no reason, but his totally mindset and memories as well? Do you even *want* this to be Doctor Who?

And furthermore we've already used the ""Doctor has no idea who he is and thinks he's a normal human"" in *Human Nature*/*Family of Blood*. To retread this ground is a bit redundant.

&gt; She will of course realize who she is at some point in the series, go all Timelord Super-Saiyan and that will be incredibly badass.

Oh dear god.

Do you realize that Time Lords do not ""go all Super Saiyan"" like in Dragonball or whatever. Seriously, don't so stuff just because it's like some other cool thing you like, do things because it's good for the story.

&gt; Though the characters are unaware as the season starts, in truth we have skipped forward in the doctors story, over an entire regeneration. THE VALEYARD.

So you are... skipping over... the Valeyard.

Why?

&gt; The Valeyard is Midnight. He could also be known as The Bad Wolf.

That is not what Bad Wolf means.

&gt; We will also see his story in this season but not from his P.O.V.

Then how? Flashbacks? We already know he turns into a ginger lady. His end is already known by the audience.

&gt; The Valeyard sees the 13th Doctor as his ultimate enemy, as her life is indication of his death.

No, her life is the indication of his life because (and I cannot stress this enough) *she is him in the future*.

&gt; The great chase begins as the Valeyard persues her looking for the secret of his eventual demise.

How is that a ""chase"" exactly?

&gt; We go far away and deep into the future spending very little time in the UK during the season. The Valeyard would look for The Doctor there, and also during most of earths history a female Doctor would be unheard of.

So she thinks he's a human... in the future. 

And the TARDIS is where, exactly? Does that come into play?

Nevermind, I'll quit with the logic because you're next point is...

&gt; The Marry Poppins connection is finally established as one of her (probably early) adventures could leave her stranded in Wales with a young P.L Tavers.

***YOU'RE MAKING THE DOCTOR GODDAMN MARY POPPINS!?!***

***ARE YOU FUCKING BONKERS!?! YOU'RE TURNING THE DOCTOR INTO A MUSICAL CHARACTER!?!***

&gt; The whole episode could be based around a gag of the TARDIS being stuck as a handbag.

Fuck.

No.

The TARDIS's Chameleon Circuit never goes off Police Box for *any* circumstance. *Never* change it.

&gt;  As the new doctor leans against the console she accidentally starts a process that returns the TARDIS to a previously marked destination- ancient Gallifrey, a place she recognizes despite her lack of personal knowledge.

What the fuck are you doing!?

You don't go back to Gallifrey, ***nobody can**.

Do you understand that? The thing's time locked, and even if you got to it it would be devoured in the Time War. Don't you understand that there's no going back there? 

That's kind of *the entire point of the Time Lock*.

&gt; River Song returns. Come on... That would be awesome. Just imagine that episode.

Dear god, no.

I wrote this for fun, thanks for being a dick about it. Now I will try and counter your points.

1. You are right about the thirteen lives and twelve regenerations, I overlooked that. Nonetheless it is only a side thought and not central to the idea or any story plot.

2. The super-sayan comment is hyperbolic description, I just meant she gains immense insight upon realizing who she is. I didn't literally mean she glows and flies. Legit in that I was not clear at all about that.

3. I'm not skipping the Valeyard, I'm making him the villain. I just think it would be hard to watch a show were he is the central character.

4. She still travels in the TARDIS and would realize she's not human before the end of the first episode.

5. I'm not the first person to make the Mary Poppins is a timelord comment, and also Doctor 13 would just become the inspiration for the BOOk Mary Poppins, having had an adventure with the author as a child.There would be no singing, that was a Disney addition to the story. 

6. You really think they will never, ever, ever, play with the chameleon circuit again, even temporarily? I would say that's getting rid of a story option for no good reason.

7. Obviously I'm less than sure about the permanent nature of the time lock and you are not. I'm fine with that.

8. It's already cannon that time lords can change gender (The Corsair) why couldn't The Doctor? I disagree that it would alienate viewers.


9. You didn't have to give such a horrible and patronizing assessment, you chose to. I'm not surprised that the idea of telling the story this differently rubbed someone the wrong way, just that they were kind of a jerk about it. The Doctor would think you were rude.

I'll add that the Valeyard could still see 13 as evidence of his ""death"" if by ""death"" I meant end of his part of the Doctors life which is exactly what I meant. Perhaps he feels that it is not a fixed point and he can change it since it still lies in his future. 

I'm also fully aware of what Bad Wolf is already all about. I'm just presenting an opportunity for a sort of call-back, one bad in a pack of 13??

Rafa selling Xabi for 35 million doesn't impress me. Finding a talented holding midfielder to take his place, or keeping Xabi, would impress me. There's been a lot written on why this season's failure was largely motivated by the lack of a defensive midfielding presence. 

Aquilani was never a class player in the premier league. It was a bad buy, and the effect of Rafa leaving us without a decent holding midfielder (besides Lucas) is still crippling to the club.

I guess? I see the logic behind that, sort of. It sounds amazingly simply and obvious when you say it. However, you have to consider that many ""petty"" criminals would reconsider committing violent crime in the first place if they felt their victim might have a means of defending themselves; the idea that criminals would just start shooting people instead of assaulting them is preposterous. It's no secret that Britain has a *much* higher rate of violent crime (assaults, muggings, robberies, etc.) than America or almost anywhere else in the world. In both our countries homicide victims are almost always hardened criminals themselves... however victims of violent crime are usually just ""regular"" people going about their daily lives.

Now that I've said that, allow me to get to the major points I wanted to make:

**A Female Doctor**

First off changing the Doctor's gender is a huge leap. The Doctor's gender is something that you're not really meant to pay attention to. It's something that just fades away into the background. He's not a man or a woman, he's an archetype, he's the Doctor. 

If you change a major character's gender after eleven consecutive male regenerations you *will* look like you're pulling a cheap gimmick, jumping the shark as it were.

What once was an overlooked and detrimental facet of the Doctor is teared from the background and thrown into the limelight, but how do you handle this tastefully?

The best way to do it would be to not make gender a big deal, but you can't just ignore it because *you've made a male character female*. That's a big change you have to address but by the same token you can't make a spectacle of it otherwise the character will just be known as ""the woman Doctor"" and have her sexuality define her (which far too many women characters on Doctor Who already have. Even the TARDIS is ""sexy"" under Moffat's tenure).

For example, making an episode all about how people treated woman badly in the past only makes her gender define her character *even more*. The Doctor's clothes don't draw attention and Martha's race (and gender) was rightfully glazed over in most stories because it's detrimental to the overarching story process.

Essentially, if you make the Doctor a woman you tread a very thin line of making it look like a garish stunt. To say ""we've run out of ideas, make him a lady"" is such a waste when you could explore a host of other more interesting facets of the character.

But that's just exacerbated by...

**Making the Doctor an Amnesiac**

The Doctor's lost his memories before. He lost them breifly in the 1996 American TV Movie, but more importantly he was made into a human in ""Human Nature""/""Family of Blood"".

Not only is it a very poor idea to introduce the audience to a random woman and say ""she's the Doctor"", but it's *even worse* to point to some random woman who has none of the memories or experiences or mannerisms of the Doctor and still saying ""she's the Doctor"".

Seriously, no one would buy into that. They simply would not feel that this character is the Doctor, and without the Doctor it is simply *not Doctor Who*. Fans would have no reason to watch a show that has no Doctor (at least, no Doctor they know of, or who even knows themselves) and no TARDIS (that she knows how to work *or* looks like a Police Box) is simply not the same show. They have *no* reason to watch that, and it's a terrible way to kill Doctor Who.

But the audience will be disillusioned further (if that's even possible) because of all the issues that are caused by...

**Skipping an Entire Doctor**

Seriously, not only is this an unnessecary pain to have to explain to the audience, but it drains so much of the mystery and intrigue of the Valeyard.

The Valeyard is meant to be the uncertain dark side of the Doctor, a possible evil in his future.

To put that in his past makes the Valeyard a foregone conclusion. We already know that the Valeyard dies and turns into a ginger lady. There's no mystery or threat anymore.

To make the Valeyard in the Doctor's past is to totally misunderstand the point of the Valeyard. The Doctor has been struggling with the wise man and healer he wants to be and the Time Lord Victorious he could easily turn into. To show the audience the Doctor getting past the Valeyard is to totally defeat the purpose of his character.

Additionally we have another problem. Unlike other Doctor's we have no continuity  from Eleven to Twelve. We don't get to see a ""passing of the torch"".

Another major reason people won't connect this strange lady to the Doctor is because you cannot show the prior Doctpr we know turning into this new incarnation (a vital step to transitioning).

You can't show the Valeyard turning into her because that would A.) confuse the shit out of the audience and B.) spoil the ""twist"" of this series.

The way you have this structured it's keeping the audience in total darkness with no connection to familiar themes in Doctor Who *at all*. What's their incentive to tune in?

**Murray Gold’s lyrics	**

Vale Decem,
Ad aeternam,
Di meliora,
Ad aeternam,
Vale Decem,
Di meliora,
Beati,
Pacifici,
Vale Decem,
Alis grave,
Ad perpetuam memoriam,
Vale Decem,
Gratis tibi ago,
Ad aeternam,
Nunquam singularis,
Nunquam,
Dum spiro fido,
Vale…	,

**Fan translation**

Farewell Ten,
Eternally,
Heaven send you better times,
Eternally,
Farewell Ten,
Heaven send you better times,
Happiness,
Peaceably,
Farewell Ten,
Heavy with wings,
To the perpetual memory,
Farewell Ten,
I give thanks,
Eternally,
Never alone,
Never,
While you breathe, trust,
Farewell…,

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Oooh, now I am having fun...

Honestly I don't like the idea of having a female Doctor, especially one that starts off with no memory, TARDIS, or proper regeneration scene. Frankly that's the biggest thing I'd change.

You can probably have a new Doctor with no memories, etc. etc. but having him suddenly becoming female on top of all that seems to be just too much.

That aside, here's how I'd handle it:

The Doctor wakes up post-regeneration present-day (or very near future) in the middle of the London Underground with no recollection of who he is.

He wanders and finds a companion who reluctantly houses the stranger.  The Doctor slowly regains his memory but throughout the pilot calls his new friend by the wrong name.

Slowly, gradually, the Doctor regains memories. He starts to remember his childhood on Gallifrey, his best friend the Master (whose name he doesn't remember). He remembers his family and Susan.

He remembers building the screwdriver, which he realizes he doesn't have. However while checking his pockets he finds an ordinary Yale key that's providing the faintest of warmth.

He relives memories amidst twitches, spasms, and belches of regenerative energy. ""You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!"", he exclaims. The TARDIS!

He desperately needs to find the TARDIS, and that's the goal of the pilot, but the TARDIS is in the hands of the U.S. Government who in turn is being infiltrated by several different alien groups who want their hands on time travel.

The Doctor relives moments of his life. He manages to save him and his companion from attackers just in time as he remembers Venusian Akido and gains a hankering for Jelly Babies.

Then he remembers the Master turning on him. He remembers the Daleks and the Cybermen and the Sontarans. He remembers losing Jamie and Victoria and Adric and so many other friends.

He remembers the Time War and losing everything. He questions what sort of man he is to bring death to everything he loves. He *doesn't*, however, remember dying as Eleven or how he actually got back to Earth. In fact there's a major hole where he has no information.

They retrieve the TARDIS after some brilliant and heroic escapade, but just as the Doctor believes to have won and offers a trip amongst the stars to his new friend his companion is fatally shot by a barely surviving enemy and collapses before the Doctor.

But I hate specials that introduce companions and kill them off for angst, so I say the Doctor clenches his teeth and says ""No!"".

He's tired of blood, tired of death. He wants days where everybody lives. He never wants to say another goodbye.

He takes his companion and brings him to the far flung future where technology allows people to be brought back from certain death.

My aunt has one now in Cirencester, Gloucestershire (she doesn't drive tractor but that accent made me laugh) and she's going to be my half partner so we are going to be somewhere within a hour or so of her.

Thinking Cheltenham, Bristol, Oxford, Gloucester, Bath, or any of the villages in that area that have a place that will be available come February-March. 

I'd prefer a bigger city.

Oxford is probably my first choice, her first pub was there so she has some knowledge of the area.

Looking for a city center type of place on the circuit.

Will be doing a food offering, but it won't be traditional British fare because while I'm knowledgeable in the kitchen, I don't know much about British food.

The idea is to to do something good, organic, and fairly inexpensive. Maybe upscale pizzas with a farm to fork mindset.

Late night food availability is something I go back and forth on. Will probably start off offering it and see if it's worth it.

Thoughts?

true,Impedence,null,null,"Running a pub these days is not easy. You really have to have your niche tailored to the local market, and the market can be very local. The smoking ban, highly changeable taste in beverages, and high alcohol taxation all contribute. In my opinion, stereotyping regions won't get you far. There are rich, poor and everything in between people of every type all over the country, the locality you're in is what is important. A major phenomenon of course is the big ""chains"". These used to just be brewery owned pubs, but now quite often it's the chains like Wetherspoons (at the lower end) or All Bar One (slightly higher end), which can make it very hard for independent pubs to compete.

When choosing a pub to go to, here are a few of the factors I think of:

* Is your pub going to be have sky sports running? Or be one of the pubs you go to to avoid the sports crowds?

* Are you going to have a pool table, darts etc? 

* Are you going to only serve light meals at certain hours, or go big on serving good food, or nothing except bar snacks? 

* Are you going to have wi-fi? 

* What are you going to do to get customers on weekday nights, quiz, cheap food? Student nights (if in uni town)?

* Are you going to play music? At what time of day? what genre? how loud? Will there be live music?

* What kind of seating? Lots stools at the bar? booths? densely packed tables? tables for meals? Lots of standing room? sofas and coffee tables?

* Are there newspapers available if you're waiting for something/someone, or taking a break?

* What smoker facilities, if any? Shelter outside if windy/rainy, heater for winter? Plenty of outdoor seating?

* What drinks will you be serving? Quality beers from small breweries? Or are you likely to be running a brewery chain pub? Or lots of cheap familiar brands? Will you be doing a good selection of wines? Good selection of fresh ciders? Cocktails none/basic/complex?

* What will your transport links be? Near a train station? Nearby bus runs late &amp; regular? Whats the parking like? Are taxis easily available/likely to cost much?",0,1337242271,null,0,1337242925,0,c4p2edx,t3_trcox,t1_c4p2edx,t3_trcox,null,1428942703,41,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,41

For those like yourself saying we should start him more, I direct your attention to the 1-0 losses to Everton and QPR, and 2-1 loss to Norwich, the only league matches he's started since February. Or the 1-1 FA Cup draw with Stevenage that he started. Or the 1-1 league draw with Stoke in which he came on at half time and gave us very little.

Obviously he wasn't the only player at fault in these matches - the team as a whole played woefully in some - but there's plenty to be said for his presence and playing style having been a large factor in those poor performances.

true,Variola13,null,null,"Just a couple of things:

* Like others have said you need to look at your area before you decide what type of pub to run, and see what is needed. I can say for pretty much certain, that many of the town centers lack a decent pub. They all tend to be aimed for younger folk, with cheapo shots and loud music. That is fine for that age, but often people tend to want a quieter background with decent drinks etc. 

* Please please please, if you are going to do draft bitter and ale, please learn to clean your pipes properly, and keep the beer properly at the right temp etc. If you are going to focus on being a 'regulars' pub, then offering guest ales is always a bonus.  Good beer,served properly will keep regulars coming in. 

* Food wise, you need to decide how much of a focus food will be. I think the late night option of food is a good one, perhaps do a before 9 full range menu, nothing too fancy just good solid food with an emphasis on homemade rather than processed. And then a 'after dark' menu which is lighter and more snack based, pizzas, cheesy chips maybe a toasted sandwich, that sort of thing. 

* Consider doing midweek deals on your food, buy one get one free or two meals for X amount tend to bring people in, or maybe free bottle of wine when you buy 2 meals from this menu etc. 

* Depending on your location you may want to be family friendly, or do something to positively encourage families in. Family friendly would at least include a baby change facility ( can be put in normal toilets) and offering to heat babyfood/bottles up. Above that would include provision of childs playthings in the garden ( if you had one) and including a childrens menu, availability of highchairs, maybe some cheap drawing books and crayons etc. You would have to consider insurance premiums though if you were going to put play equipment outside, but everything else is fairly doable. 

* Beer garden, if you can find a place with a beer garden that is a big attraction in the summer. Especially if you can then do BBQs outside and sell food that way. 

* Surroundings, sofas are always a bonus, people like that, and real fires too. However they do take up room, you can get more tables and chairs in for the same room a couple of sofas take up. Personally I would not have bar stools, they are nice because people do still like to sit up at the bar, but it is a pain in the neck when busy. Perhaps you could have them there during the week but not weekends as some pubs do. 
Decor wise, you need it bright enough so people can see what they are doing, but not too bright and loud. 

* Decent toilets, seriously this is a much neglected area of pubs IMO, nothing will turn me, and others off more than shabby messy cramped small toilets. This may not be as much of an issue for me, but for women definitely so. 

* Sports pubs, personally I bloody hate them but I know they can be popular. If you have the room, a good compromise would be to have a section of the pub set aside with large TV to show big sports events for those that want it but not make is a sports focused pub. 

Well that ended up as more than a few! Hope it all goes ok for you :-) If it is of any interest in live in the South East, I am very left wing,  I am the daughter of a publican and I worked as a bar steward for many years.

Family friendly would at least include a baby change facility ( can be put in normal toilets) and offering to heat babyfood/bottles up. Above that would include provision of childs playthings in the garden ( if you had one) and including a childrens menu, availability of highchairs, maybe some cheap drawing books and crayons etc. You would have to consider insurance premiums though if you were going to put play equipment outside, but everything else is fairly doable.

I find this whole bit really funny.

It's just standard fare here.

Not having a baby changing station or a high chair available could potentially equal lawsuits in the States.

Britain is one of the only countries in the world with completely unarmed civilians... and you also have the highest rate of violent crime. In contrast, the US state with the lease amount of gun control (Vermont) is also the state with the lowest rate of violent crime. I think that's saying something. Clearly the British belief that ""more guns equals more violence"" is completely incorrect. Have fun over in Merry Olde England where a ""chav"" can stick a knife through your throat knowing you don't have any means of fighting back; he also knows that if he's caught by the police he'll only spend a small amount of time in a ""prison"" that's more similar to Disney World than prisons elsewhere in the world.

He is out of a job, which means no need to buy out his contract. He is young and hungry for another chance to prove himself in England, after being unceremoniously and unfairly booted out. He doesn't have a huge reputation or strong clout with our fans, so it will be easy to boot him out if he fails. He is still considered as one of the most promising young managers in European football, so he doesn't come with too much bad rep. Most importantly, being young and unused to having absolute power, he will be easier for a director of football to work with. 

Obviously not the best option, but not the worst either. He has experience in winning a league, which is better than the mid table managers we were linked with. He is easier to sack than Rafa, and almost definitely less stubborn. And if he runs into locker room politics from Gerrard and Carragher, I'm sure the owners won't hesitate to sell them. I mean, they've sacked one Liverpool legend,what's another two more in their eyes.

I'd say a big difference between UK and the US politically is that it seems you have it the other way round and back to front: your south is right-wing and poor and your north (or coast) is more left-wing and rich. Your countrys a fuck of a lot bigger so I'm aware how ridiculously over-simplified that is. Our right-wing isn't nearly as crazy as your right-wing also: religious fundamentalists don't get any say by and large in politics. A good example would be your abortion debate: here the state provides abortions, and the idea of having it any other way seems ridiculous to most people.

Personally, my ideal pub is in the traditional style: not too flash with mostly wooden tables and chairs but a few thick comfy padded benches. There are amusing signs all over the wall. The smoking area is a roof-top patio with heaters. The bar-people are well trained enough to draw a shamrock in my Guinness, and maybe for the sake of my girlfriend they do a few cocktails (I'm not too fussed about this though). There is a wide selection of ales to taste if I'm feeling adventurous. There is a pool table, a dartboard, a selection of boardgames and a jukebox which has the best of rock throughout the ages on it, from Led Zep to the White stripes. No TV. No flags. There is a stage where bands can play or other performers do their stuff. I would be friends with the landlord, so lockins would be frequently encouraged: during these lock-ins it would be okay to smoke inside: tobacco or weed. 

I'm getting carried away now. I generally just want a nice refreshing pint and a puff on a cigarette in a non-pretentious environment. I like Samuel Smiths pubs because they are cheap and cheerful.

Seeing as though the facebook group was called 'Welcome to Israel, only kidding you're in Giffnock' leads me to think that there **is** a little more to the story. Facebook groups which seek to target specific groups like this often have racist hate speech on them, many of the posts on these groups also seek to incite violence.

Also:

It's important to note that (from a little googling) it seems that there's been a history of people racially stereotyping the Jews in Giffnock:

http://217.18.90.33/news/uk-news/55137/herald-editor-says-sorry

&gt;In his column, he wrote: ""If Newton Mearns was Nazat Issa, residents would not be allowed to travel up the road to Waitrose."" He also made comments about how residents would find it hard to get to the private Hutcheson's Grammar School, and would be upset about their house prices.

&gt;Ephraim Borowski, director of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities said: ""His references to Waitrose, private schools, and house prices simply show that he can't resist another age-old stereotype.""

Now, I'm not saying that I think white people should be treated better, and I still think it is out of order that people should be going about making anti-semetic comments, but I think the treatment is unfair.

It makes me think back to the [MP Diane Abbot Race Row](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16423278), where in responce to the media usage of 'black community leaders', she said 'White people love playing ""divide and rule""', before ending with the hash tag '#tacticasoldascolonialism'. After she said this, after a bit of a furore, nothing really happened.

Now, while I don't think people should be arrested for making racist/offensive comments (as long as it doesn't come down to threatening), I think everyone from every background should be treated fairly on level ground.

The story I posted yesterday about LFC going in for AVB was from a person who works in the industry who told me that the phone calls and text messages between agents and others went nuts with the news of AVB being approached. This was within minutes of the first rumor of Kenny being gone.

FSG are familiar with AVB because they scoped him out while he was at Porto. There are a couple of issues with the AVB deal:

1. Roma want him. But Tocapina, the new Roma owner is an LP and partner in the NESV fund and vice-versa, so there is a financial link between the two clubs that most people don't know about. AVB would prefer England and would prefer Liverpool. Apparently FSG cleared with then that they want to make an approach

2. Every permanent Chelsea manager has a no-shop clause in their management deals where they are not allowed to join another Premier League club after they leave Chelsea. From what I understand, FSG think that this clause isn't valid and that they can challenge it.

3. Nobody else has been approached yet

4. FSG want to get a manager in place as soon as possible, talking hours

5. Apparently AVB was in Liverpool two days ago before the KK announcement. I found a photo of him at the airport but haven't been able to confirm the details of it yet so haven't posted it. I got in touch with the person who took the photo and he insists it is from two days ago.

As a side not I don't know where I stand on the raising of tuition fees, as it stands it makes little difference to access to higher education due to the loan we have but it does make it more of a choice for people going to university.

Tiscali were horrendous. Hugely severe traffic shaping during peak hours, and remarkably poor connection speeds outside of them. Blamed the connection issues on BTs hardware, only when presented with tables, were they shown otherwise.

DirectSave... Eh, not that bad, if I'm being honest. Not an LLU provider in most exchanges though, so if BT have an issue, then you have an issue. Technical support was handled by Eclipse, who were brilliant.

BT... Can't say much for the speed (Mum uses them, and I live about 100 or so miles from hers), but for setup and troubleshooting without calling, they're reasonable.

Sky... Current provider, and I'm having issues finding anything wrong with them, other than the fact that it's a pain in the ass getting your username and password to use a 3rd party router. Not that there's anything wrong with the DLink one they gave me, but it's always handy to have them for troubleshooting. Connection-wise, actually unlimited, which is always nice.

The way a business reclaims VAT is that they charge VAT on things they sell. Then at the end of the quarter they submit their VAT return to the taxman saying ""we took £X in VAT on our sales, but we spent £Y on VAT on our expenses; therefore we owe you £X-Y"".

This applies where X &gt; Y.

You can't reclaim VAT if you haven't earned more VAT in sales than you've paid on VAT in expenses.

""Reclaiming VAT"" only really applies to businesses - it might apply to a charity if they had stores in which they sold books or t-shirts on which they collected VAT. But that probably wouldn't apply to Guide Dogs For the Blind because they don't sell anything and are probably supported mostly by donations (I'm guessing).

I don't think you get to be exempt from paying VAT just because you're a charity.

To put it another way - if these paedophiles are not known to the police, the newspaper has a duty to report them, not publish their information.

Actually, this would be a very interesting hypothesis to test. Let's design an experiment. Something to do with posting links. Our afferent variable should be population. Our efferent variable should be link karma, of course. It should involve making several test accounts (the larger the sample size the better), each commanded by a different person. And each person should be handed a list of subreddits (constant across each person), and spend a given number of hours browsing each subreddit. Then, they should post a link in each subreddit at exactly the same time of day as the other people posted it that they think would garner the most karma; something that conforms to the general perceived hivemindedness of each subreddit. Then, as the numbers roll in, we put them on a scatter plot (x is subreddit population, and y is percentage of the truncated mean of the first 25 top submissions of the subreddit) and draw a best-fit line.

""Rich"" seems to be an undefined amount of a ""Jewish person""'s X possessions. The person saying this statement does not know the amount of money(?) he/she Jewish person has or how much they got the car for.

""Every X drives Y"" can only be known if the person making the statement asked all of X in their social circle. The current sentence to me sounds of certainty when no evidence and size of X has been provided / defined. This is why I suggested the word ""often"" be used.

Well obviously not racist, but maybe consider the current case of disabled people. Careless comments for political gain by the current government has led to a substantial increase in the bullying and victimisation (including violence &amp; intimidation) of disabled people. Similarly you could organise a hate campaign against a particular estate that led to people getting killed. Claiming innocence because you didn't do the violence is pathetic, and our law acknowledges that.

&gt; talking shit about someone and risking them getting killed is a hell of a stretch.

Eh?! Have you just ignored the whole of history?

&gt; Similar? It's exactly the same.

Not it's not. Like I tried to point out, it's about context and consequence. Fanbois rants don't lead to violence, intimidation or a raft of societal problems. Therefore, who cares except fanbois.

&gt;Are you denying that tribalism between rival football teams doesn't escalate to violence?

Absolutely it does, and the most famous and currently worst of it in the UK is in Glasgow. Where hate speech laws are very much active and part of the solution. Until those disgusting chants are ended, the violence will not go away - along with a whole bunch of other things that need to be done. Obviously just dealing with the words is not enough.

You're right, it can. Every freedom has a cost.

&gt;So you have the balance the rights of an individual to express the disgust they feel for homosexuals with the rights of a homosexual to go about their day without being harassed or threatened.

This is partially true. You do need to make a choice, but the choice is not one of degrees, it is one of absolutes. Either you ban the right to offend and verbally abuse, or you ban freedom of speech. Take your pick.

&gt;It's really not a simple debate when your dealing with abuse or insults, at least not compared to political free speech such as voicing ones opinion that the Prime Minister is a bit of a twat and his cabinet are a shower of bastards.

You've said something else, which means you must have a completely different definition of what equality actually means. If you can't answer that then we are gonna go round in circles.

The very idea of taking into account other factors in your quest for equality means that you are not practising equality in my opinion. 

Let's say the country was 50% white, 25% asian and 25% black. If we wanted to have political equality should we then half the number of votes that white people get so that between the 3 races, there is equal voting power?

The only thing Gerrard does better than Lampard is the rare flash of amazing-ness like some random 50 yard volley or a crazy bursting run. 

Super Frank on the other hand, keeps everything under control most of the time. Going about his business and to be honest, I doubt he gives a crap what the media says about him, as long as those close to him know what hes about. 

Heck I remember an interview for England he did a year back or something where he said he didn't want the permanent captaincy because he was too old and he wanted the younger lads to have it. If he wanted that captaincy, Roy would probably have given it to him over Gerrard, if there wasn't any bias from Roy with Liverpool of course.

Last season wasn't his best but that was also the season where he missed the most games if I remember through injury.

Journalists will never favor us over the more 'esteemed' clubs like Liverpool or Utd and Arsenal. Heck, I respect Utd because SAF is still winning shit left right centre barring this season. 

The lot I can't stand are the Liverpool supporters who haven't won the Premiere League once since it was made in 1990, hey guess what, we have 3.

They say we are never a top club until we win the Champions League. Hey at least we are still in it (hopefully we win this season and stay there).

Soon enough they'll just be rounding up people they dont like the looks of or people that try &amp; expose the various crimes our leaders frequently commit. (I find it amusing that I am working class &amp; was brought up in a ""poverty zone"" or whatever they call it , yet the Prime Minister, who is a rich posh guy thats never worked a day in his life knows and more importantly WORKED WITH more confirmed criminals than I do! Why is everybody OK with that?)

At the end of the day logic dictates that punishing someone for saying something racist or ignorant has the OPPOSITE effect, The actual hate behind racism is not a real thing, there is no ""racism center"" in the brain. Racism is caused by ignorance and/or lack of education, punishing someone for being stupid is helping no one and in some cases it only reinforces some of the ignorant / stupid beliefs these people have, but of course they know this better than we do and that is the purpose of this in the first place. While we're busy hating &amp; mistrusting each other these cunts are taking us for everything we're worth!

Education stops racism, punishment only makes it worse.

Some people would not like it, and quite rightly I'd get called a twat by a lot of people, that's par for the course, but there should be no reason for the law to get invovled.

&gt; Hmm. I'm not sure what to think. I was sad to see Dalglish go - for all the many mistakes this season, ably chronicled on /r/soccer, I didn't like the idea of us having a 4th manager in 4 seasons, and I thought Dalglish deserved one more season to see how his squad shaped up.
But I might just prefer Martinez over AVB, the other name being bandied about. While AVB's ideal football is attacking, attractive, and successful at Porto, at Chelsea he didn't show the flexibility to adapt it to the squad at hand. Liverpool's defensive unit might cope better than Chelsea's under AVB, but we don't have enough attacking players to fit his vision.

&gt; Martinez, on the other hand, strikes me as more flexible. Sure, he hasn't had any 'big name' successes or proven trophy haul, and neither did Hodgson and that worked out horribly - but nobody's going to really suggest that Martinez's style of football is the same as Hodgsons? Wigan outplayed us at Anfield.

&gt; What we need at the moment is a manager who will look to get the best out of the squad that - rightly or wrongly - Dalglish has assembled, give or take a few new (relatively cheap) signings.

What does he have that other managers lack?
He won't come with huge demands. SC seems likely to stay, other managers might demands overhaul of staff, require 50m to get their ""own"" players, play in a way that will make our last summer and Dalglishs work useless (henderson/adam/kuyt/maxi in a 4-3-3? imagine). Demand full control, whereas FSG will want DoF. Willing to compromise with players when it comes to playing style, knows the PL.


AVB,Benitez,Cappello etc. are all big egos, the team cannot afford to risk it yet, Mou works for teams when they open them self up in desperation for trophy, imagine him at LFC, boardroom fights, huge demands, putting himself over the club. That is what it looks like when people talk about other big name managers, they are too big for LFC, we need a humble but talented, we aren't about buying the best, sometimes the best has to come through, this is calculated risk and Martinez has come out on top.

2 years ago AVB was huge risk, klopp, Ferguson, moyes and KK. None of these boasted of great experience when they were first given their jobs before becoming big name.

If he becomes our manager, please show your support and let him prove himself, YNWA isn't just about players and fans, managers are included in that deal when they sign.",0,1337289114,null,0,false,0,c4p9xia,t3_trx2m,t1_c4p9xia,t1_c4p725a,null,1428946319,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

 * You get £8,105 tax-free allowance a year. Any tax you pay on this you can reclaim.

 * Your employer *should* calculate how much you would hypothetically earn in a year, and then you pay tax on that. If this comes to less than the £8,105 you shouldn't have to pay any tax.

 * At the end of the tax year (April), you can calculate how much tax you paid and how much you should have paid, if there is a difference then you can claim that back. 

 * You'll be paying national insurance, (NIC). There's nothing you can do about that.

Just to emphasise point 2. If you are earning more than £155 per week, you can expect to pay tax on that, even if you are only working for the summer. If you are working all year round, then the calculations are most likely to be correct.

Rafa

Martinez

Klopp

AVB

Bielsa

Allegri

Capello

Rodgers

Pep

Mourinho


That's 10. I can't think of any more at the minute.

Breaking them down leaves us with:

**Why on earth would they come here**
Klopp - just won the German league for the second time in a row. Has unfinished business with the Champions League.

Bielsa - Just took underachieving Athletic Club to the Europa League final, absolutely demolishing some top teams along the way. Likely to be Barca's next coach.

Allegri - In a stable Milan team, who have Champions League football and are probably going to win the league next year.

Mourinho - Self-explanatory.

So the list becomes:

Rafa

Martinez

~~Klopp~~

AVB

~~Bielsa~~

~~Allegri~~

Capello

Rodgers

Pep

~~Mourinho~~


**Unlikely**
Pep - Wants a year out and is a man of his word. Plus we are sinking quite quickly. Maybe an ego boost for him to drag us up but I doubt it highly.

Capello - Wants to manage a top flight club in the Prem but I can't see him coming here, ~~considering certain players' views on those who can't speak English~~. Edit: Also, the owners are said to want a manager who can speak English.

Rodgers - Far too soon for him. If offered the job I suspect he'd turn it down.

Moving on:

Rafa

Martinez

~~Klopp~~

AVB

~~Bielsa~~

~~Allegri~~

~~Capello~~

~~Rodgers~~

~~Pep~~

~~Mourinho~~

**Finally:**

Rafa - Certainly would be the most popular of the remaining candidates *for the majority of supporters* - but there are some deep, deep divides over Benitez. Personally I'm a pro-Rafa person but there are too many people who don't want him back. Plus I suspect FSG are looking for something of a yes man - someone who will toe the company line, act sensibly in press conferences etc., won't demand control of transfers and so on. That's not Rafa.

AVB - See OP. Talented coach but not without substantial flaws. Holds an advantage over Martinez as he would know the foreign markets at a higher standard.

Martinez - Performed well when his back was to the wall, and generally has his team playing good football. My major concern is Wigan wouldn't be in the position they are in if they had a decent back line, the majority of which was assembled by Martinez. He doesn't seem to know the defensive side of the game at all, and is very inexperienced.

There. Choose for yourself.

The trouble with letting upvotes/downvotes dictating content is that (and I have said this before for anyone reading) lurkers then dictate content.

true,RedSquaree,,Belfast,"Indeed. Here is an excerpt from one of the articles I was talking about for anybody interested. I think it's interesting *anyway* and if people wish to engage in the discussion of paramilitary policing in Northern Ireland they should read the research. Loyalist/Unionist community organizations (LCOs) and Republican/Nationalist community organizations (RCOs):

To digress slightly, it is a notable feature of Northern Irish society that levels of recorded crime have tended to be (and still remain) significantly lower in comparison with the rest of the United Kingdom ( NIPB 2007 b ; HMIC 2007 ; PSNI 2008 b ). Unlike the often compared transitional democracy of South Africa, which suffers from ever rising and extreme levels of violence, the people of Northern Ireland appear to have relatively little to fear (Altbeker 2005 ; Shaw and Shearing 1998 ). Though, in returning to our main point, a clear lesson has emerged from the research within both the police and the community contexts — that such sustained levels of social control and reduced crime within the post-conflict transitional space are not due to the successful implementation of any overarching (community) policing policy. Indeed, it was generally recognized through the fieldwork with the PSNI that their ability to conduct community policing (and manage crime more generally) would be significantly attenuated if it were not for the level of community-based security governance that provides both supplemental and parallel ‘ policing ’ at the local level. Indicative of the community sector attitudes across Republican and Loyalist areas, one group simply noted ‘ it [crime] would be a hell of a lot worse off I can tell you … if this place was England, it would be a tinder box … ’ (RCO). Interestingly, it was also evident from the research within the diverse community levels that, in many cases, the PSNI were also happy to ‘ sit back ’ and allow such ‘ others ’ to do their work ‘ because it was doing their [PSNI] job for them ’ (LCO).

There was much more to the rebellion than high taxes. The British government wanted to impose laws on the treatment of slaves, outlawing harsh punishments that were commonplace in the West Indies and Americas, such as forcing slaves to deficate in the mouths of the slaves that did not work hard enough. This is why the British offered freedom to any American slaves that defected to fight for the British army.

Mikel has been IMMENSE the back half of this season - i was his biggest critic for a couple of years but he's been brilliant since RDM came in. Solid, good in possesion, positioning and tackling better than ever! Romeu is great, but Obi's stepped up and locked down that spot for himself.

Plus the Mata chat?!?!?! He's a winger? Really? I think we've got ourselves a beautifully creative attacking midfielder who could do a job anywhere, even as a striker. Sitting in the hole Mata is untouchable - at times this season the link up play between him and Torres has been breathtaking, although until late there's been the well publicised no end product from Fernando. 

Mata is a wizard with the ball at his feet, it's a pleasure to watch - those of us who are a little older will fondly remember franco zola dancing around with the ball at his feet in a similar manner. 

IMHO you shouldnt pigeon hole someone as creative as Mata - but i feel he's most involved in the game (and therefore most effective) when he's in the hole.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"My thoughts...

* **Jurgen Klopp:**  This would be my dream appointment but it isn't going to happen.  He has unfinished business with Dortmund in the Champions League.  In the back of my mind I was thinking that if Kenny stayed one more season then it would open up this possibility because Dortmund are going to start breaking up their team soon and I though maybe we could come in for him next summer but that would be unfair to Kenny and you can never intentionally stagnate your team like that.  He's brilliant, Germany are producing great young players, but it's a year too early.
* **Fabio Capello:**  He's 65 years old, would demand enormous wages and probably has no interest in a club that is years away from competing for the title.  I can't see interest from either he or the ownership.
* **Rafa:**  It's hard to see the ownership doing this.  They want to make this their club and going backwards like this, again, would be a strange decision.  It would certainly be interesting if it did happen, though.  He's spoken about how his biggest lesson from his time here was that it is better to invest in fewer, sure thing players than in lots of mid-priced, established squad players.  That is a good lesson.
* **Andre Villas-Boas:**  He obviously has a preferred tactical system and it just didn't fit with the team he had at Chelsea.  I think parts of our squad, especially our back six (Reina thought Lucas), would benefit from his system but I don't know how Carroll would work in it.  I think he would absolutely need to sign a left footed mid-fielder and a different type of center forward.  I worry that his system is too rigid and that his success at Porto came when he had the best talent in the league, which he won't have here.  Still, this would be a progressive appointment with the potential for a very high upside.
* **Roberto Martinez:**  This has always seemed the logical choice and he appears to be one of the front-runners.  He has done some good work at Wigan by brining in players that fit his style and trying to instill a new playing philosophy while not being so rigidly tied to it that the team suffered too much during the transition.  Wigan played good football this season under less than ideal circumstances and it is worth remembering that they were one point shy of being as close to us as they were to relegation.  His best work came at Swansea, though, where we now see the fruits of the type of project that he was trying at Wigan.  This would be a big step up, but he may be ready for it.  If it works we could have our long-term solution.
* **Brendan Rogers:**  This one makes no sense to me.  Just sign Martinez if you are considering Rogers.
* **Paul Lambert:**  My favorite among the Premier League managers.  He has done absolute wonders with Norwich, he is ambitious and he has the background as a player that gives him credibility with other players, even if he doesn't have all the coaching achievements.  Norwich play really good football, he has very modern tactical ideas and has shown a flexibility in style that would benefit a team like we have, which has a roster that I think does not fit into any particular dominant system at the moment.  I would be very happy with this appointment.
* **Luis Enrique:**  He just got fired by Roma (owned by a former FSG partner) and they had a disappointing season so I don't think he would be considered but he has a similar profile to some others who we are being linked with.  His history with Barca and clear, preferred playing style would make him an unsurprising, if marginal, candidate.
* **Non-starters:**  Guardiola and Bielsa are even less likely than Klopp and Capello, who are already out of the question.

My personal ranking after eliminating Klopp as unrealistic:
1. Villas-Boas
2. Lambert
3. Martinez
4. Rafa
