&gt;The print edition of the paper is edited by Paul Dacre, who is regularly praised by media types for knowing what his customers want, and then selling it to them. This is an extraordinary skill that puts him on the same rarefied level as, say, anyone who works in a shoe shop. Or a bike shop. Or any kind of shop. Or in any absolutely any kind of business whatsoever. Whatever you think about Dacre's politics, you can't deny he's got a job to do, and he does it. Like a peg. Or a ladle. Or even a knee. Dacre is perhaps Britain's foremost knee.

There are endless examples of managers who *don't* know what their customers want.  As abhorrent as what Dacre is peddling may be, he is clearly brilliant at doing so.  He is more than ""just a knee"": given the Mail's success, he is like an advanced bionic Olympics-winning knee.  Albeit regrettably so.

What I also find sinister and brilliant and vile is the way that the online version manages to bait and troll its readers.

Now the writer of that article doesn't personally give a shit either way whether the celebrity is thin or fat (why would they? - unlike the political commentators who do in many cases believe their right-wing hatefulness) but they do know how to press readers' buttons for maximum sensation.

The advantages of the iPhone was that it was a cross between a phone and an iPod and I reckon most people still use it for that.  It still beats my Desire in that respect because the memory is so much smaller on the Desire (although you can plug in more).  Plus it has by far the easiest way to find and buy music from a mobile through iTunes.  I also think the touch screen is better on the iPhone than the Desire (although why is harder to put into words).  However the camera on my Desire HD is better than the iPhone 4 (although the 4s is a significant improvement.).

Work out how much you'd spend on a music player and a digital camera, then take that off the cost of an iPhone.

Having said all that, the iPhone's downfall will eventually be its closed system.  At the moment virtually all apps are made (or updated) iPhone first, but I don't think that will continue ad infinitum.  More Androids are being sold now, so it is only a matter of time before the apps for androids overtake the iPhone ones.

They had an article recently discussing how poverty stricken  Greeks were dumping their children on the streets because they could not afford to look  after them.  
And they had a picture of a gypsy boy in the street (which may/may not have been taken in Greece.)

That article was incorrect.  Some people were placing their children in the care of the Church/orphanages as they could not provide  - but they were certainly not dumping them on the street.


A better an more honest version of the article was on BBC and the Guardian .


DM sensationalises and distorts  - and it is a celebrity gossip filled tabloid.  You cannot compare it to the Guardian.

The only figures that suggest the Royal Family make a net contribution to the UK coffers are the ones released directly from the palaces (who, incidentally, refuse to provide full and transparent accounts and are not required to fulfill FOI requests);

* The estimated total annual cost of the monarchy to taxpayers is £202.4m, around five times the official figure published by the royal household (£38.3m last year).
* The official figure excludes a number of costs, including round-the-clock security, lavish royal visits and lost revenue from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.
* Civil List expenditure has increased by 94 per cent in real terms over the last two decades.
* £202.4m is equivalent to 9,560 nurses, 8,200 police officers and more than the total annual Ministry of Defence spending on food. The total cost is also equivalent to a number of high profile government cuts, including cuts to the Sure Start programme.
* The British monarchy is 112 times as expensive as the Irish president and more than twice as expensive as the French semi-presidential system.
* Britain's royal family is the most expensive in Europe at more than double the cost of the Dutch monarchy.
* Taxpayers are kept in the dark about the exact cost of the monarchy, due to the royal household's exemption from the Freedom of Information Act and widespread misunderstanding about the nature of the royal family's finances.

I get the train home.  If the it brakes down and can't be re-started or cleared, then 1000 people get off and go to the bus stop.  That is not an exaggeration.  12 carriages full of people have to get off and go to the bus stop.

So the first bus comes and maybe 50 people get on.  That is all that can fit.  Then the next bus and the same happens.  I am young and fit and healthy and all that, so I stand around and let the old and pregnant and people with kids and crutches get on.

Buses are spaced 10 minutes apart so it will take (I know) about 3 hours for the 1000 people to be moved off.  TfL know that too.  So they send more buses.  But people are cowards and lazy and selfish.  So they board the bus but they don't want to squeeze up or go upstairs.  So the board the bus and stop.  There is plenty of space and it is now raining and I am cold and bored.  But I have to wait an extra hour because some prick won't move up and the driver wont force them to because that is ""not my job""?

How is that justice, well how else should we proceed? Should every case go to a full trial at the tax payers expense just in case they are lying in their guilty plea? As long as there is strong evidence against (which the text itself qualifies as) that should be enough.

Whether he knew about the riots or not (very weird coincidence if he didn't) doesn't matter, the law isn't dependant on current affairs. Either he knew about them and wanted others to join in, or he didn't but wanted people to start one anyway.

A school that sets the children homework in order to encourage them to learn, and gives them something to do outside of school hours.

They teach your kids how to read and write.

&gt;The Director noted on the referenced memorandum, ""I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the La. {Los Alamos...?} case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination"" 

So, does this mean that the army found a flying saucer and withheld it from other interested official agencies - in this case the FBI - who wished to analyse it?

**Some quotes:**
&gt;""All Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin - flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that name. Every time it occurred, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute silence."" 

*Maurice Chatelain, Former Chief of NASA Communications Systems*

-

&gt;""At no time, when the astronauts were in space were they alone: there was a constant surveillance by UFOs."" 

*NASA Astronaut Scott Carpenter*

-

&gt;""Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary. The cumulative evidence for the existence of UFOs is quite overwhelming and I accept the fact of their existence."" 

*Air Chief Marshall Lord Hugh Dowding, Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force during WWII.*

-

&gt;""The phenomenon of UFOs is real. I know that there are scientific organisations which study the problem. It must be treated seriously."" 

*Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev*

-

&gt;""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe that unknown flying objects are nonsense."" 

*Roscoe Hillenkoetter, Former CIA Director in a public statement, 1960.*

-

&gt;""Of course it is possible that UFO's really do contain aliens as many people believe, and the Government is hushing it up.""

*Professor Stephen Hawking*

-

&gt;""I've been convinced for a long time that the flying saucers are real and interplanetary. In other words we are being watched by beings from outer space."" 

*Albert M. Chop, deputy public relations director, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,(NASA) and former United States Air Force spokesman for Project Blue Book.*

-

&gt;""I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth"" 

*President Harry S. Truman*

-

&gt;""I don't laugh at people any more when they say they've seen UFOs. I've seen one myself!"" 

*President Jimmy Carter (1976)*

-

&gt;""I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, have you ever seen anything like that? He was shocked and he said, ""Nope."" And I said to him: ""Let's follow it!"" We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it."" 

*President Ronald Reagan*

-

&gt;""I'm not at liberty to discuss the governments knowledge of extraterrestrial UFO's at this time. I am still personally being briefed on the subject!"" 

*President Richard M. Nixon*

The fact is, people don't want to read bland news screened by a bipartisan mediator to remove all opinion or catalyst for discussion. They'd much rather read something which caters to their worldview so they can feel justified in themselves. Take your 'occupy' example: 

&gt;Protestors gather at St. Pauls Cathedral in London to voice their disregard for what they believe are 'unethical' business practices of banks and large corporations which they believe caused the current financial crisis, causing a danger to public health and disrupting business at the Cathedral.

Now that is as unbiased as I could make a news headline on Occupy London. Would Redditors like that headline? Hell no! They wouldn't want to hear any criticism of a movement they're fawning over. Would pro-Wall St citizens like that headline? Nope, it's not the banks' fault. Nobody would buy that paper.

Newspapers exist to sell themselves and make money, and they do that by finding an angle that they feel enough people will agree with, and write for it. This is how capitalism works. If nobody agreed with that viewpoint, nobody would buy the paper. The alternative? State-controlled and owned media, which doesn't bear thinking about. You want people to be more critically thinking when it comes to their news sources? Don't ban partisan reporting, get people to consider viewpoints they disagree with (Not just Daily Mail readers. Reddit would be a good starting point...).

How does the government here in Wales expect to carry out this policy? Are police going to check every car where the driver or a passenger is smoking, to check there aren't any children on board? Are police going to be capable of fining people on the grounds that people might have smoked while kids were in the car, because a car they pulled over smells like tobacco? What if the car is stopped and someone in the car is smoking out the window, are they causing a problem?

We shouldn't stand for laws like this, they incriminate the wrong people as a result of the minority. They don't tackle the problem, they don't aid people. This law won't make who aren't aware of the problems of second hand smoke on children realize the damage they're causing. They're just a binary means to an end that purely try to prevent then resolve the problem. 

Did you know Window cleaners aren't allowed to use ladder here anymore? Fucking stupid right? As a result they're profession has been compromised because they're forced to use equipment that doesn't match the standard they once had when they were allowed to climb up to the window and clean it properly. Why does this law exist? Because some meat head in an office somewhere probably noticed a rise in accidents surrounding window cleaners using ladders, and decided the best solution was to call an absolute ban on window cleaners using them. Ignore how incompetent window cleaners have been allowed to perform their job without correct training, lets just harness the professional window cleaners from doing their jobs.

Basic line upgrades arent enough. Despite the cost rail travel is still going to increase substantially according to most estimates and current lines cant cope.

The best way to describe HS2 is it is essentially a train motorway to the a a nd b roads of current lines, the increase not just in speed but in volume it will be able to take is massive.

 Using that argument against it is like saying we should never have built the M1 because the roads in the rest of the UK at the time needed improvement and people could still get to those places. HS2 is the M1 of the rail network and like the M1 and other motorways of the 60s/70s it is absolutely vital for keeping the infrastructure viable in the longer term. 

The london to birmingham link is the first major part but still part of HS2 is it then expanding to manchester and leeds from birmingham as phase 2 of HS2 in the budget and from then on it should be the first part of a HS network connecting all the major cities and the UK to the continent's high speed lines via the HS1/eurostar lines.
 
London-Birmingham is key because it is a route that is currently at capacity and straining under the number of people using it. It also acts as an ideal starting point that links up the north and the south and that will be optimal for linking the lines to other cities.

I also dont think the costs are that insane considering a) the cost of infrastructure projects in general and more importantly b) the huge long term benefits both social and economic it will bring.

true,kris_lace,null,null,"&gt;If what you're shooting at here is that all news channels and newspapers should be totally bipartisan and report only the facts, you've just killed the media industry stone dead, which is bad for everybody.

Let me reply in three points:

1. My issues are more toward corruption, manipulation, exploitation, misrepresentation and stations disregard for ethical responsibilities. Not just the bias and headlines style.

2. But regarding my expectations from the media, and you asking me what I expect them to do, not write biased headlines etc? I don't care so much. The point I'm making is to put the media and news stations aside and let them do whatever. If you want to know the truthful news, I'd recommend self informing. Now I know that many people don't have the time and resources to thoroughly do that, much to my dismay. I'm making it an important goal of mine to tackle that.

3. Regarding the *even if a good company just reported news, they wouldn't be successful* . I take a systems theory approach to this. As stated in the post even with good intentions a news company wouldn't succeed very easily. As long as news and media is fuelled by profit - it will be subject to conflicting aims. Do we report the truth, or do we sell papers. That's an issue with the system, which I tried to address above. The good thing about self informing, many bloggers post articles in passion and dedication with no monetary incentive. When we have passionate news stations willing to do the same - I'd be a much hopeful guy.

In addition, if people actively stop buying and watching unreliable news, the media's approach would have to adapt to that and they'd be forced to whip into shape if they want our custom.

true,mao_was_right,cnty-wales,poverty,"&gt;Do we report the truth, or do we sell papers.

You're spot on here. Despite the fact that papers are legally obliged to report the truth (or at least, if it can't be *proven* it's not the truth...), papers first and foremost have to keep circulation by printing what their readers want to hear - which can involve manipulation, misrepresentation et al above - in order to keep going. But who's more at fault: The newspaper which exploits its power as a dictator of popular opinion, or the guy who picks up the paper, tuts under his breath and says 'I can't believe they get away with this' while handing over 20p with his other hand? Do you legislate against a market which is all above board apart from bad ethics? Should law dictate which morals are bad and which aren't? It's a mire of bear traps and unseen consequences.

Bloggers making informative articles with no monetary incentive dodge this particular swamp, but fall into one of their own - they will always have a bias. Imagine everybody turned their TV on to Guido Fawkes in the morning. Sure, he can often be right, but manipulation and misrepresentation of the facts are fundamental to this form of reporting. It's swings and roundabouts.

For everything else, you may as well just follow Reuters on Twitter.

The BBC reported that ""thousands"" of people showed up and many news networks emphasised on a few select few who after the days peaceful protests started engaging in anti-social behaviour hours after most people went home.

Until you see what is fundamentally wrong with that statement you have no idea. If you think drug and treatment costs in the UK and US are the exacts same and the only difference is who foots the bill, you lack the understanding to even have this conversation.

Go read up on rights issues in the production of drugs which drugs are available for production in Europe by anyone as opposed to a single rights owner in the US. What effect this has on drugs prices. The sort of collective bargaining that NICE can do on behalf of the NHS that isn't possible outside a social healthcare setting.

Seriously, I'm not trying to be rude, but you're about as naive on these issues as I've ever seen, and that in itself is fine, but it's the fact you *think* you know what you're talking about and are quite forceful about it that baffles me.

Also, that's when the episode discussion begins, which brings me to my second point.

You have the choice of voting for two or three rich white men with remarkably similar views on all of the key issues - europe, monetary policy, education, nhs, transport, immigration, endless wars etc, there is no choice here. Added to that is the worst electoral system in all of Europe including pissing Monaco and Andorra that ensures that the majority of people in each constituency are not represented at all, not even a little bit. Add in the unelected house of lords (i'm aware of the argument for them, I just disagree), the fact that we are subservient to the unelected EU commission and that we have a press that maintains this theatre means I think voting in it's current form is a waste.

- Visual Certexam suite and all the braindumps were quite good
- I concur with knowing your subnetting, I initially started with Jeremy's pretty long (but concise) method of subnetting
-Jeremy Ciora is an absolute legend, I would start with his subnetting method to really crucially understand and gain the binary mindset for looking at subnet masks but after that I was shown by some colleagues the most awesome method of subnetting using just counting on your fingers, and you can literally get to the correct answer of any subnetting question within seconds. It really was brilliant. subnettingquestions.com was pretty good to. I also found it wasn't just to learn HOW to subnet, but once you've got it down you can just look at the network address and CIDR notation (/stuff) and just pretty much get a pretty accurate guess of the number of hosts, ranges etc straight away.
-I also bought Boson Netsim ICND1 (if you want I can find the actual code) for about £60 just really for their simulations to get a feel for what i'd be like in the exam, and I reckon it was worth it, not sure if i'd buy the one for ICND2, but if you can afford it the ones for CCNP I reckon would be well worth it because that's when you really need to know your shit.
- There is nothing like hands on physical experience, however I pretty much cruised without it but I do work around the networking field (hoping to get my foot in the door of that team in the very near future) so have real world experience and i'm used to handling and seeing the real deal.

That's a pretty sweet lab you've got there, i've pretty much only used this dodgey java-based networking simulator software somebody gave me and a touch of GNS3, although my benefit is that I can logon to big boys like 6500 series and 3750's (L3 switches) and see real live access lists and VLAN configurations. I've been working a lot with VLANS at work at the moment, and no doubt it's certainly helped me to avoid the textbooks and just do the real thing. Bit rusty at the moment as i've avoided it for 2 months though... feeling the burn..

Problem I found with packet tracer is a whole bunch of things such as all the cryptography stuff is basically not supported, and with GNS3 it's basically for routing, so to simulate a switch it's a ""router on a stick""

....also just noticed your fishers comment in another thread. good choice. You are right, the one in leith is way better. :)

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"&gt; Football players have a lot of control over their feet, and he wasn't anywhere close to the ball. 

I don't know where you're seeing this. He kicked Parker square in the stomach and Parker was standing right below the ball as head headed it. Naturally his midsection is right below his head, which was right below the ball. Looks to me like Suarez would have struck the ball had Parker not been there. 

&gt;still pic or not why are your hands around someones face?

Like I said, I didn't see video so IDK. But he was likely grabbing at him to try and get around him, just judging from the still picture. Likely not going for his face, but he possibly was. It's dirty play, sure, but it's way different than intentional eye gouging. It's once again the same thing as the first - reckless. And it's also something we see so many players do - even elite, world class ones. I could list two dozen off of the top of my head. 

&gt;I'm just saying I am starting to see a pattern here.

Look hard enough and you can see more patterns. I thought Skrtel was more ""dirty"" today than Suarez. Imagine the reception that Suarez would have gotten for Skrtel's performance. He body checked Bale off the pitch. He clipped Bale's leg on a studs-up challenge. He was very physical all game and was clearly trying to intimidate Bale.

Football is a physical sport. It's full of grabbing, pushing, and shoving. It's not all inherently dirty and most people want to still see it be a physical sport. 

I'm sure you've played sports and likely have had a moment where you've done something reckless or dangerous unintentionally. I have hit many players in the face playing basketball - never intentionally. All I'm saying is that things happen at high speed when grown men are playing hard. I think we're really putting Suarez under an unfair microscope and over-analyzing a few mistakes. 

As far as the ""reverse elbow"" - I still don't see any evidence to say that Suarez even hit him. And even if he did - do you really think he was targeting Parker's head? Maybe he was trying to grab him to impede his progress. Maybe he was trying to feel where he was going. Once again, it's an issue of recklessness and not dirty play.

true,ultrasupergenius,english,A Yank in Jolly Old London,"From reading your response, it almost seems like you are under the impression that purchasing a product or service based on the fact that the seller of that product or service intentionally annoys you is a demonstration of a greater intelligence than purchasing a product or service based on the fact that the seller has produced an entertaining (although historically inaccurate) feel good message invoking patriotism.

Is that really your sentiment? 

Secondly - and this is really surprising to me - it seems that you are under the impression that the 'average' American would not be able to identify the historic inaccuracy of using a 2012 automobile in the late 1700's.  

I propose the following:

* The 'average' American viewer of this commercial would identify the contradiction of using a modern vehicle in the revolutionary war, and would in fact identify that as a noteworthy and entertaining aspect of the advertisement.

* The 'average' British viewer of this commercial would identify the contradiction of using a modern vehicle in the revolutionary war, and would in fact identify that as a noteworthy and entertaining aspect of the advertisement.

* The 'average' British viewer of this commercial would not have been able to identify whether or not Sir Jeffery Amherst, Commander in Chief of the British forces during the American Revolution, was portrayed or not.  Further, I propose that they would not be able to choose Sir Jeffery Amherst from a lineup of depictions of British General throughout time.

* The 'average' American viewer would be able to identify the driver of the lead vehicle as being a portrayal of George Washington, Commander in Chief of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary war.  I would also propose that the 'average' American viewer would be able to identify a portrayal of George Washington from a lineup of American Generals throughout time.

Given the above proposals, I still come to the logical conclusion that it is farce and folly to use a television commercial as a method of determining the 'average' intelligence of a population or culture.  It is flawed, to say the least.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; He's talking about tech entrepreneurs.

On the surface perhaps, yes.  But the way I read that article was that it was all building up to this:

&gt; We need to stop wasting our energy in hating the disgusting affluence of the top 1 per cent

I don't buy his argument that anti-capitalist protesters would be popping up their tents on the lawn of a British Mark Zuckerburg.  He seems to have missed the point that the Occupy Wall Street (and elsewhere) protests started in the US and I don't see any tents popping up on the real Zuck's lawn.  People in both the UK and US are engaging in ""banker bashing"".  They're not targeting the rich and/or successful in general, they're targeting a particular subset of the rich and successful people who are fucking things up for everyone else.

&gt; We have that, in London. 

Sure, to a degree. I've worked for a number of companies over the years that were all based around Old Street so I'm not disputing what you're saying about London having the ""right stuff"".  I personally gave up on working in London because I found it too depressing, but I still work as a freelance consultant for startups based in London and various other places around the world.

So I accept that it was wrong of me to say ""we haven't got places like Silicon Valley"", because we have.  But they're just much, much smaller than what they've got in the US.  Everything in America is that much bigger and so statistically speaking, if for no other reason, they're much more likely to be where the big startups come from.

&gt; The UK is not a place that generally admires success - especially not financial.

I'm not disputing that either.  Compared to the US we're much more reserved about wealth.  But I don't really see how that actually stops anyone from succeeding in business, particularly as a tech. entrepreneur.  You said it yourself that London is ""definitely one of the very best places in the world for doing a tech startup"".

The title of the article is ""Britain won’t create a Facebook until we learn to praise success"".  I think that's nonsense.  Britain could very well be the source of the next Facebook, but it's just unlikely because we've got far fewer people working on the problem, so to speak.  In my opinion, it's got little to do with the fact that we're culturally reserved about praising financial success (which we are), and even less to do with the fact that people are engaging in ""banker bashing"".   It mostly just comes down to the numbers and there's more of them (in the US) than us. 

Boris is adding 1 and 1 and ending up with 11.  I maintain that he is talking out of his arse.

Plus repairing even a small bump to a nice car can easily cost a few thousand these days, as accident repair places specialise in making cars perfect, including a total respray so you can't see the edges of the patch.

There's not much you can do in a month except pay by installments. If I were you, I'd look around for a car in a lower insurance group and see if you can do a training scheme like 'pass plus' or the IAM that might reduce your premium. Or a scooter...

If you've been on your parent's insurance for a year without a claim, some people will count that in your favour.

I see no reason the human brain (or any other brain) can't be reproduced in electronic form.

You wouldn't be able to watch television as it would just appear as a slow progression of still pictures. How quickly such creatures could move is debatable due to physical laws-certainly not 3 million times faster than humans but perhaps several orders of magnitude faster. Humans may someday move into electronic-mechanical bodies and beyond but I doubt if they'll retain the human brain as in the Cybermen-that'll probably be the first thing to go. Human or robot, aren't we just flesh robots? Watching Destiny of the Daleks the other day I was surprised to hear both the 4th Doctor and Davros refer to Daleks as robots. Maybe it doesn't matter. And if human thought can be reproduced electronically, there may be other forms or matrixes stable yet malleable enough to allow for consciousness. Energy matrixes seem more problematic but who knows? This was all dealt with at the end of the novelization of 2001 A Space Odyssey. I remember reading somewhere about civilizations trying to survive during the last stages of the heat death of the universe. They depended on subtle variations in temperature, a few thousandths of a degree above absolute zero, to survive.

There is that old chestnut that our universe is just part of a simulation someone is running. And how do we know that the simulation they are running isn't part of another simulation someone else is running? And so on. Turtles all the way down.

true,ThisBoysGotWoe,null,null,"Really? You have no idea what level of ball I've played. Though I'm certainly not the most skilled player, I played on some pretty decent club teams with some pretty decent players. While that doesn't mean anything in the context of this argument, I'm not some guy who just recently became interested in the sport. It would behoove you to not make assumptions about someone you don't know. 

Also, I never said that it wasn't clumsy or reckless. However, a reckless tackle warrants a yellow card, not a red. If you're saying it's violent conduct, then you have to make the case that he wasn't challenging for the ball. While that argument could be made, I think it doesn't hold that much weight considering that he would've actually volleyed the ball if Parker hadn't headed it. If you're claiming it was a challenge that constituted serious foul play, then the question becomes whether or not Suarez used excessive force. Personally, I don't believe that he used any more force than a normal side volley. In fact, I think Suarez used less force than most side volleys, being as he didn't really torque his upper body at all. The argument could be made that he endangered the safety of Parker, but honestly, you're not going to really injure someone by half-kicking them in the gut with your instep. The most you'll do is knock the wind out of them and maybe leave a bruise. 

&gt;But it doesn't matter what the reason is - when you kick a guy in the stomach when he's jumping for a header - IT IS A STRAIGHT RED.

I've been kicked in the stomach before on an attempted side volley, and no red was produced. I had to step off the post to get a head on a cross. The guy crashing front post lined up his side volley without seeing me and nailed me in the gut. Granted this was Sunday-league football, but let's be honest: regardless of the level, many players lose focus on their surroundings when a good chance presents itself, especially if the ball is in the air. Honestly, I wasn't pissed that the guy didn't get sent off because I recognized that there was no ill will and that it's not that unreasonable for a player to focus too much on the ball in that situation. Sometimes you take knocks like that in the course of your defensive duties. 

&gt;We know Suarez has incredible awareness, and is one of the sharpest players in the Prem.

Let's also not forget that Suarez did just serve an 8-game ban, during which he didn't really play any top-flight matches. He didn't start, and he missed an open header in the final minutes that he normally would've buried. I think it's safe to say that Suarez isn't completely on his game yet. 

&gt;It's often frustration rather than malice.

You're absolutely correct, except in this case, Suarez was only in for maybe 5 minutes. How many times in your career have you gotten that frustrated in only 5 minutes?

These are just my observations and experiences. As a lot of my views are subjective, I have no problem with you questioning them. Just lose the condescension, unless you're ready to provide anything more than made-up statistics and unsupported opinions on the Laws.

true,33rpm,flair8,,"&gt;However, a reckless tackle warrants a yellow card, not a red. 

not necessarily true. two foot studs up tackles are ""reckless,"" the players don't necessarily want to injure their opponent, but it's still reckless, dangerous, and a straight red. 

&gt;I think it doesn't hold that much weight considering that he would've actually volleyed the ball if Parker hadn't headed it.

de jong would have kicked the ball had alonso not been there in the world cup, did that not warrant a red card either? (i know he didn't get a red, but pretty much everyone agrees he should have). your argument is completely invalid here because of course *had he not been there* he would have kicked the ball..but he was, and suarez is either a) blind or b) knew he was there

&gt;  regardless of the level, many players lose focus on their surroundings when a good chance presents itself, especially if the ball is in the air.

so why don't players try vicious side volleys every time a corner is put in if the worst case scenario is you kick someone in the gut and miss the ball, with no punishment? if a ball is in the air, every semi-competent person knows that it will be headed before it reaches the ground if there's *anyone* remotely near you (especially in a defender's own fucking box), which there obviously was in suarez's case. 

it was indefensible, in my opinion.

Most people fizzle out with husbands, wifes, boyfriends, girlfriends because they get into those relationships with expectations, entitlements and other fantasies without knowing the person they're with.

If you can remain friends with someone for 15-20 years and you happen to both be single, I can promise you you'll get a chance.

This one is a little harder to explain via text, but at bar 46, instead of just the two D quarter notes in the left hand, it should be more of a progression: D, D-E (bar 47) F, F (bar 48) F, F-A (bar 49) G, G (bar 50) G, G (bar 51) Bb. A.(bar 52) G. F. After bar 52, jump bar to bar 36 and repeat.

Lunging tackles warrant a red when they are executed with excessive force and significantly endanger the safety of the opponent. As such, they are considered to be serious foul play. It's not enough to claim that a challenge was reckless and thus deserved a red card. 

&gt;de jong would have kicked the ball had alonso not been there in the world cup, did that not warrant a red card either?

De Jong deserved a red card for serious foul play, as he went up for the challenge with his spikes up, thus very clearly using excessive force while posing a significant danger to Xabi Alonso. I was addressing the argument that some people were making that Suarez was guilty of violent conduct. My point was that violent conduct (again according to the Interpretation of Law 12) is only applicable when not challenging for the ball. The case could be made that Suarez' kick was a facade of a challenge and that he was not really challenging for the ball. However, I don't buy that because he attempted to push Parker out of the way beforehand and because he would've in fact gotten his shot off if he had been successful in pushing Parker. 

&gt;so why don't players try vicious side volleys every time a corner is put in if the worst case scenario is you kick someone in the gut and miss the ball, with no punishment?

This wasn't exactly a driven cross with defenders at the ready. He pushed Parker beforehand for the explicit purpose of clearing space for his volley (/so that Parker couldn't clear it). Was his choice to attempt a side volley reckless? Absolutely. But it's not as if he went into it thinking that he would just kick Parker for the sake of injuring him. Also, Suarez didn't escape without punishment. He was in fact carded for his poor choice. ",0,1328646695,null,0,false,0,c3oum0f,t3_pek52,t1_c3oum0f,t1_c3otkfq,null,1428312559,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The trouble I've always had with these statements is they exist in a way that they can never be proven without a slavish pouring over every criminal case in the UK looking for data that was probably not taken.

How would you prove or disprove this? It's perfect. You can say it safe in the knowledge that the mere absence of evidence is evidence enough for what you want to get across.

Simply, every crime isn't reported in the news. In fact every racist attack isn't reported in the news (there are *thousands* a year and we see a few in the press) yet people will, with confident authority, state they **definitely** know that not one of the unreported (in the press, not to the police) cases that are tackled every year was of an ethnic minority attacked by a white person that didn't end in a race hate conviction.

I myself went to school in Bermondsey. I had fights all the time, and in one I *was* set upon by two white boys (one would go on to famously have a nightclub brawl with Chelsea footballers John Terry and Jody Morrison, with his older brother) The attack was not racist, we just didn't like each other. But in your World I and the many people who are attacked by white people without instantly grabbing the race crutch don't exist.

If you're saying (as i think you are) that a race crime does not need to have some form of racial gesturing/language included, then what **does** constitute a race crime? We need to figure that out before we go any further in the discussion as to whether or not this was a race hate crime.

And if we take a step back and even try to define a hate crime, how can we determine what is or isn't a hate crime without the criteria set out for us? Without clear definitions this will (as is) dissolve into an argument about semantics.

Sure.

In general textbooks were not required although there was *one* we did have to buy. I bought books of my own accord. I still have several of the programming books I bought at the college library for 99p each when they were selling off old books (Without EMA I wouldn't have had any money).

Travelling meant being able to do something with friends. Skateboarding, cinema every 6 months or so. The accommodation was 5-6 miles away from the previous family home. I've heard many people cry ""That's not essential!"" but these people are robots that seem to think social interaction is not a necessity of life. And yes, many times I did the 2.5hr walk to and from instead of paying for public transport.

Did you know the temporary accommodation we lived cost over £400 *per week*? This of course was paid by council benefits to my mother then to them. They do it because they know it's the council paying. We didn't get the child support we were owed for a period of 2-3 years also (and even then, it's completely fucked with CSA).

Do I think the state should have paid? No. But I'm glad they did. It kept us as a functioning family and let us continue our education (During this time my mother trained as a Nurse and has worked as one since). Its (benefits) purpose as safety blanket should always be there for those that need it. Since that time my mother/siblings and I have paid tens of thousands in taxes (all work).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;First, would an independent Scotland be able to use the Pound as its national currency? or would it have to mint its own alternative currency? or would it have to join the Euro?  
  
In all likelihood, this issue would have to be settled before official independence began, but I imagine they would either use the euro or a Scottish pound.  It would be very simple for Scotland to issue Scottish pounds at a 1:1 ratio with English pounds and let the currency fluctuate after that, and would be only a little less simple for them to adopt the euro and ensure they had an ample supply at the official date of independence.  Currency is mostly a logistical issue, and one that would not be all that complicated to overcome.  It's just a round of discussions, followed by some sort of decision, then deciding on a conversion rate from the old currency to the new.  
  
&gt;Second, the UK's entire nuclear deterrence is based in HMNB Clyde which is in Scotland. What would happen to this base? Where would the UK relocate its nuclear submarine base to? Would Scotland have to form its own military? or Would the UK continue to defend Scotland?  
  
Given that they are UK military assets, I think the most likely scenario is that they would move to another base, probably in England.  Either that or Scotland could allow the UK to continue using HMNB Clyde and possibly charge us for it, or negotiate some sort of trade deal.  
  
&gt;Third, Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch have all said that an independent Scotland would not receive the same AAA credit rating the the UK has, this would mean higher borrowing rates for the Scottish government and higher rates for the consumer in Scotland. Would this ultimately negate any economic benefit from independence?  
  
Scotland may well garner its own AAA credit rating.  They'd be likely to keep more than their population's proportion of North Sea oil, and would probably inherit a relatively small percentage of the UK national debt, putting them in a reasonably good economic position going forwards.  
  
&gt;Fourth, would an independent Scotland be able to join the EU?... the EU has brought many economic benefits to Scotland, such as free trade with other EU nations. But an independent Scotland would have to apply for membership, (and we all know how long those take). What about NATO, UN, IMF, WTO membership?  
  
I suppose it's possible that Scotland could be fast tracked into the EU - but I don't know if a member state has ever split in two.  I don't even know if this is an issue that the EU has ever considered, so it would be very interesting to see how they handled it.  
  
None of the issues regarding an independent Scotland are all that complex on their own - the only problem is getting them all sorted out before they split.  It would mostly be a matter of taking the time to sort them out, rather than any particular issue making independence a non-starter.  If they vote next year and decide on independence, it could take a decade before it actually happens.  
  
And for the record, I'm English.  I have no vested interest one way or the other regarding Scotland - whatever the Scottish people want to happen is what should happen.",0,1328651830,null,0,false,0,c3ovndm,t3_pf87r,t1_c3ovndm,t3_pf87r,null,1428313043,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There's debate as to wheather this was racially motivated. **This** incident I'm talking about specifically.

What I'm saying is if the victim was &lt;insert any colour/race here other than white&gt; and was set upon by a gang of white guys then it would be portrayed in the media as a racist attack regardless of it being racist or not.

The media are reporting this as a racist attack by a gang of Asians (knowing the area it will be Bangladeshi) on a white youth but there's some people in this thread saying ""Well, you can't say that"" or words to that effect when if it was the above situation it would be perceived as such.

Lets us also assume we agree that police and prosecutors can't read minds. They can again only go on evidence put before them, including statements from all parties involved.

If you hit some black guy, unless *he* tells the police it was a racist attack, but you said nothing, they would investigate it, find no evidence of such and you'd at most face assault charges. If you decided to call him a dirty spade while throwing your punch, then it would come down to that evidence again...maybe this time someone overheard. If some third party corroborates the victims story that you said that, then you'll face the same assault charge, racially aggravated. Your sentence will be stiffer.

Now, I'm not sure what point your trying to argue, but surely you can see the difference? Even if in your head during the first silent attack you were saying ""nig-nog-nig-nog-nig-nog golly"" in your head, there would be no evidence for anyone to go on to make the assault racially aggravated no matter what the victim said.

Conversely, you'd be hard pressed to convince the prosecution that your utterance of a racial epithet whilst carrying out your attack was no indication of your feelings towards black people.

Now in this case we have CCTV footage of the attack. What we don't have are third party witnesses...the *only* people who could corroborate the use of racial slurs. In fact we only have the word of the victims that any racial slurs were used. *That* is why that portion of the charges were thrown out. the police investigated it as a hate crime but the CPS didn't accept it happened.

What is it you want to happen? The simple say so of victims to be ""good enough"" in a British court of law? Come on man. 

Look for one of my first posts on this topic today. In there is a link to white men walking free from court after an assault, just like the Somali girls. Was that some insidious race bias also? It was white men Vs a white man.

The justice system needs fixing, but the racial element needs to be left out. You're fighting the wrong battle. In fact, here you've shown evidence you'd rather like it to be worse!

Yes, unless you can *show* me evidence to the contrary. What shocks me is your inability to accept that your *word* is not a good enough argument. So far your arguments have simply been ""there are cases all the time"" of which you can't seem to cite any, and ""there are cases all the time"" again with nothing to back this up apart from the fact you decided to type it.

I had it included in all of my offers for University and although I didn't need it in the end, it was a nice feeling to know I had that to fall back on if necessary. 

To be honest, if you're that against the welsh back you never should've gone to Cardiff High as they state that they are a Welsh Bac 6th form and expect every 6th form pupil in CHS to take it regardless of whether they agree with it or not. 

However, I do agree that the way in which they approach pupils criticism of Welsh Bac is appalling. One of my friends, got into rather a lot of trouble with a senior member of staff for ""voicing her opinion of Welsh Bac on her facebook page"", which the staff should not have been on in the first place, never mind the fact that it was in fact her twin sister who had been saying stuff about Welsh Bac, not her and the member of staff didn't even bother to check if they had the right person before punishing her.

Look, I don't want to argue with you. The way I see it you're very different to the two other twits I've argued with here, i_want_to_be_an_ant and brianstewey. They are truly beyond help.

You on the other hand, you just seem to be operating under some misapprehension which easily just looks like fear of something others have told you is happening to you. That's easy to do. I'd just implore you to take more than one source into consideration.

I can tell the ""bad"" ones from the ones that kind of lose the way sometimes. I'd never go as far as say you were racist. i_want_to_be_an_ant clearly is, and nothing can be done for the lad. I only argued with him to reveal the eventual logical collapse that was inevitably coming. With that sort of person they usually descend into racial slurs and innuendo as their argument becomes untenable. He's now embroiled in an attempt to tell me, a Nigerian, about the apparent Arab influx to West Africa as opposed to the East. It's riveting stuff!

Anyway, I digress. You seem to have some fears, and to you they're real. I respect that. But you have to respect my perspective. I read daily about how society seems to be leaned towards giving me some sort of advantage, or that, despite black males being over represented in the legal system, the judiciary is apparently bending over backwards trying their hardest *not* to jail them. I can't help but being confused. 

Surely you understand that if someone says ""If X happened the papers would 100% do THIS"" and X *did* happen and the papers did nothing of the sort I have to question you? You say it's a feeling, but there are actual cases you could look at to see if your feeling is right or not. When that opportunity arises and you flat out refuse to assuage your own fear, it's hard to sympathise. This story is no different to the Asian guy who was shot around Christmas, and right here in this subreddit people *did* question the paper reporting it as a racially motivated crime.

I hope you actually go out and have a look. Life is better when you're not needlessly rapt with fear put in your head by the sorts that would gain from you viewing the world as ""us Versus them""

I work hard in any job I've had, but I can't stick them if I don't like it (I don't burn bridges and just quit etc).  I've had one long period of unemployment and I'm now back there after being laid off from my last job (""orders are down"", when in reality they'd just got another 4 no wage slaves from the job centre)

It took me the best part of 10 years to realise I like hands on manual work, but most of that kind of work pays very little to wreck your body, so I'm in college now training in electrical installation, so hopefully self employment is in my near future.  Because at the moment, I can't even get an interview, never mind a job.

The only grouse I have with these numbers is these are reactive data - as in, the numbers reflect reactions by the referee. Nowhere in these data-sets is there a provision for events that did not get a reaction or got an incorrect reaction. 

Allow me to explain. 

Rooney escaped a yellow while Lamps was shown a yellow against QPR for dissenting. Similarly, Scholes escaped a red for a two-footed lunge - in fact I don't think anybody noticed it in the heat of the game. However, recently, a player got sent off (or was it just a controversy?) in a Man City match for a similar lunge. (It was Adam Johnson on Lescott, I think.) Cahill escaped a booking on the edge of the area. I'm not even talking about incorrect offside calls because that's the linesman job/fault and we're looking at refs, currently. However, what I am definitely saying is that all these 'missed' incidents weigh on the game to some extent. 

And that, precisely, is my discomfort with Mr. Webb. Yes, these 'missed incidents' happen to both sides but they end up costing us the game more often than not. 

This is NOT meant to take away anything from the magnificent work you have done with the available data. Multiple kudos &amp; rah-rahs about that! I'm simply thinking aloud, wondering if there's a way to track/acquire a dataset of dubious refereeing decisions. :-)

Re a general pardon, it would not be pointless at all and it is not something one should do for every repealed law.  I actually dealt with situations where going back into the jurisprudence makes sense and where it doesn't in my post, but, again, you didn't read it so you wouldn't know that.

The first Doctor introduced the curiosity and eagerness to explore. 

The second Doctor added whimsicality and upped the level of deception a bit (by having the enemy underestimate, though Hartnell sometimes tricked people). 

The third Doctor added real panache and action-y, he also felt as close as the Doctor has ever gotten to an establishment character (though still very anti-establishment). 

The fourth Doctor added the zany-brained version of eccentric professors. 

The fifth brought in the flippancy and the ""Here we go again"" take crap from companions selflessness. Like all Doctors he would risk his life for others, but this incarnation was particularly altruistic. 

The sixth brought the flamboyant melodrama and bombastic conviction. He was probably one of the closest to be bipolar-ish. 

The seventh Doctor really brought home the mystery. He's always been mysterious, but this is like Time's Champion more-than-just-a-Time-Lord mysterious. There was a whole arc at work. He's also more mercurial and manipulative than the previous Doctors. He looks at the bigger picture rather than the details. that makes him seem more ruthless. 

The eighth was very much about the celebration and beauty of life. He talks about the support of his friends and whom he loves. He's very human in a different sort of way. (mind you I haven't heard all the radio dramas). 

The ninth Doctor brought on the hurt and anger of post-Time War while still being tragically happy at some points- mostly conveyed in the quote, ""Go on. Do what you've got to do. Save the world."" The way he says it is *very* 9. 

I have to disagree with the OP, i think ten really brought the emo on. He was different from other Doctors in that he felt things so intensely. It was probably like a Time Lord puberty in that hormones were really getting to this one. He was very manic and celebratory about life like 8 but differently. 

Eleven is different from other Doctors because he's getting pretty dark. Pretty close to 7 but in some ways darker in a bad way. He also has a lot of guilt, and not just for the Time War but for all of his newer companions.

Nobody took him seriously and he wasn't much of a leader at all. He took a lot of crap.

I don't think that the ninth is totally about alone-ness. It's definitely a new aspect to the character, but not really because of his new incarnation so much as the whole Time War thing.

GK: Hart - Will be our keeper for the next 10 years. I loved Weaver and will always remember his penalty saves at Wembley but Hart is just so, so, so good and will lead us to great things.

LB: Danny Tiatto - Absolutely loved everything about him as a player. He had pace, could score a cracking goal, took set pieces, could tackle and was as mad as a hatter. Almost kept us up singlehandedly under Royle.

CB: Andy Morrison (C) - Dragged us out of division 2 kicking and screaming. A real leader who was probably the best bit of business City ever did. Real captain material.

CB: Vincent Kompany - The best defender I have ever seen play for us. If he leads us to a title then he will be the captain. Incredible.

RB: Micah Richards - 4 years ago he would have been a lock for centre back (that derby performance under Sven!!!!) but he lost his way under Hughes. Mancini came in and transformed him. He is phenomenal going forward and gives everything for the team.

CM: Yaya Toure - Took a while to convince me just how good he was (lazy bastard!!!) but is the best midfielder in the league. Scores vital goals and is an automatic choice for Mancini.

CM: Kevin Horlock-  Keegan transformed him into a great holding midfielder in the 01/02 season. He wasn't the quickest but did his job oh so well. Also loved club.

CM: Ali Benarbia  - Best debut from a City player I have seen (Birmingham at home in 01). Him and Berkovic together were phenomenal.

AM: Georgi Kinkladze - I don't remember that much of him but I do remember silky skills and wonderful goals. One of the most popular players we have ever had.

AM: David Silva  - Has to be included. Imagine him, Benarbia and Kinkladze together, now that's entertainment.

SC: Shaun Goater - With good service he scored goals galore. This team would provide good service and then some.

Subs;
Weaver (incredible in his day), Van Buyten (played maybe 5 times but was brilliant, I wish we had signed him), Balotelli (such a wonderful player to watch), Aguero (goalscorer defined), Elano (Ego? Yes,lazy? yes but a fantastic player and could take a penalty), Edghill (loved the guy and he was a massive City fan too, didn't deserve the shit he got from fans),  Milner (I think he is the most underrated player we have, has been immense this season and can play pretty much anywhere)

Not the most balanced team or bench but I think they would beat any of your teams hands down :).

I fantasize about The Doctor and Sherlock Holmes having an episode together all the time.

To go off on a bit of a tangent here, I hate almost every single companion The Doctor has ever had. My favourite episodes are the ones where he is by himself. I believe the show is far more entertaining when it's just The Doctor bursting into a clueless crowd and saving the day from something; leaving jaws agape in wonder at who he is and how he just did that, without having some nag whine about something or question him despite having witnessed his brilliance a few hundred times already.

I feel Sherlock would be a far greater, far more competent companion for The Doctor to have. It would also be hysterical to see them interact.

true,woadgrrl,scottish,Western Isles,"I think you're misunderstanding the situation.

First, what's actually happened is that one state, California, passed a law some time ago to allow same-sex civil unions.  (In the U.S., these civil unions are generally synonymous with 'marriage,' for legal purposes.)

After this law was passed, there was a huge campaign (mostly by out-of-state donors) to add a ballot referendum to overturn this law and amend the California state constitution to legally define marriage as being between one man and one woman, which would prohibit same-sex unions/marriages.  

This referendum passed, but was almost immediately challenged, and the appeals court has ruled that the referendum itself was unconstitutional, so the original law goes back into effect.

A couple of key differences between this situation and that in the UK:

For starters, this is only one state, and one that's pretty well-known for being quite liberal.  There are a handful of other states that have legalized same-sex unions, and they're also heavily liberal states.  At the same time that these states were legalizing same-sex unions, dozens of other states were passing amendments designed to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying, or receiving any benefits equivalent to marriage.  

The U.K. already has same-sex civil unions.  Unless I'm mistaken, these unions carry the full set of rights and benefits that marriage does.  For all practical, legal purposes, it's the same thing.  So the difference between those civil partnerships and marriages is primarily a symbolic one.  

So, if you're suggesting that the U.S. is in any way progressive with regards to same-sex marriage rights, you're sadly mistaken.  

Also, while I completely understand why people in the U.K. continue to push for same-sex marriage, and completely support them, I can also see why it's maybe a bit harder sell for the public.  It's really not a case of actual civil rights being violated or denied, as it is in the U.S.  Gay couples already have all the practical, civil benefits of marriage.  

So, while you're getting plenty of conservatives campaigning strenuously against it, it's harder to drum up support from the general public, because to people who aren't being directly affected, it must seem like a largely semantic argument.

TL;DR:  The UK is so far ahead of the US in terms of gay rights that they're barely in the same galaxy.  Since gay people in the UK already have full legal benefits through civil unions, it's harder to get the general public to care too much.",0,1328663237,null,0,false,0,c3oxqw5,t3_pf7hp,t1_c3oxqw5,t3_pf7hp,null,1428314030,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Again, that was added later.  Before the TARDIS interior just changed without any in universe mention.  It wasn't until the 5th doctor that they acknowledged any of the changes in universe and not all of them after either.  There's a long history in who of just quietly replacing and updating things as the series progresses.

&gt;at the very least the one that Nine used had been mass produced at a factory for sonic devices

No.  Jack's sonic blaster was from a factory that mass produced guns, some of which were sonic. The doctor destroyed that factory and replaced it with a banana orchard.  The quote from the episode you're referring to is

&gt;Captain Jack Harkness: Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks, ""Ooh, this could be a little more sonic""?

&gt;The Doctor: What, you've never been bored? Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?

Which implies the doctor made it sonic himself.  Then in A Christmas Carol the Doctor explicitly states me invented it

&gt;Kazran: I've never kissed anyone before. What do I do?

&gt;The Doctor: Well. Try and be all nervous and rubbish and a bit shaky.

&gt;Kazran: Why?

&gt;The Doctor: Because you're going to be like that anyway. Might as well make it part of the plan and then it'll feel on purpose. Off you go then.

&gt;Kazran: Now? I kiss her now?

&gt;The Doctor: Kazran, **trust me. It's this or go into your room and design a new kind of screwdriver.** Don't make my mistakes. Now! Go!

As for your claim that because people recognized the sonic, it wasn't unique to him, we're talking about an infamous centuries old time traveler.  The fact that someone recognizes something he has doesn't mean he didn't make or invent it.

&gt;What I'm trying to say with all of this is basically that even though the changes were just different props in real life, all but the TARDIS exterior could be justified in universe fairly easily, even if you have to stretch it a bit. 

It wouldn't be that easy.  The whole ""The Chameleon Circuit has been broken since 1963"" has been established and reestablished as recently as between the 11th Hour and Beast Below. It's explicitly stated that it's broken and cannot change appearance.

Add to that the fact that Liverpool is making nearly all of their points in tight defensive matches.  They don't score goals often, but they also don't need to.

And then, of course, there's ""Time Crash"". 

I wonder if, as *Doctor Who* continues on, there'll be a gradual shift towards more...anti-social (for lack of a better word) Doctors. The kind who would rather be off seeing the universe than having Christmas dinner with friends and family. I doubt it, since it was that anti-social slant that eventually killed off the classic series, but it would make a nice antidote to the warm and fuzzy Doctors we've had recently.

I can see both sides of the argument when it comes to 'forcing' churches to perform both heterosexual and homosexual marriages, but I find myself coming down on the 'should be forced' side.

This if for the simple reason that many different things can be justified with religious text if you want it to and I don't see the that religious opposition to homosexuality should be entertained just because of this. It's not a universal objection for one thing, and there's much support for gay marriage among UK Christians. As an analogy to why I don't think religious institutions should be 'allowed' to oppose gay marriage: Although we didn't really see it in the UK, over in the US there was a good real of obvious outspoken opposition to interracial marriage and of course much of this was religiously motivated - in a similar way to slavery being justified through biblical passages. Indeed there are verses in the bible which speak of avoiding marriage ""outside the tribe"". It doesn't matter where they are or what context in which they 'should' be read, the fact is that they are there. So, if we were to give religious reasoning credence for not allowing gay marriage, should we also 'not force' churches not to marry interracial couples? What if the majority of the congregation didn't want it either, not just the guys in charge?

I doubt anyone in the UK would think twice about condemning *anyone* for saying ""Marriage should be take place between a black man/woman and a white woman/man. It is against [my/our] god and it says so right here."" Such people would possibly face prosecution depending on how they phrased it - that's how far anti-racist feeling has come. This would be because our society has progressed considerably, of course, but though the feeling expressed in that case (racism) is slightly different in discrimination, the justification is still essentially the same (even if it's perfectly clear something else it at work): ""My god/religious book says so.""

There are numerous churches/congregations in the UK that want to, or have a majority that want to, offer gay marriages. In fact there was recently a letter sent to the General Synod by nearly [100 clergy from London urging them to change their mind.](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/clergy-rebellion-over-gay-church-weddings) If 100 clergy in London feel that way, then I have no doubt that there are loads elsewhere etoo. I have a feeling that, given the support of the general public too, it is the hierarchy, the blokes in frocks, that are against the idea more than anyone else. In that respect, [Rowan Williams seems to have shifted about in his support of the gay priest Jeffrey John(http://contact-online.blogspot.com/2012/01/ill-sue-church-of-england-if-it-bars-me.html), alternating from supporting his application to be a Bishop to backing someone else.

There is an option I can think of which will both show that the religious bigotry (I use that word carefully in this case, and I think it's right) is not being supported and ensuring that churches that don't want to perform gay marriages don't have to: Revoke the marriage license of any church that doesn't support gay marriage. Of course, there will be much opposition to this and people will see it as 'blackmail', but I'm not sure that it is. For one thing, a church doesn't *have* to perform marriages in order to function and it's not like couples can't go elsewhere. That could be levelled at gay couples too, of course: ""If you want to get married why don't you go to Church X? We don't want to do it at Church Y."" but it's easy to counter that example by bringing up the race analogy again. We don't allow a shop not to serve blacks because they don't like them, even if there's another shop next door the black people could go to. Similarly, if a church told gay people to go elsewhere they are essentially treating the gays as 2nd class citizens and that's what this is all about.

I've seen it argued before, and I imagine that many people might think similarly: ""But why do gays want to get married in a church? They're obviously not Christians."" Well, to respond to that: very often a couple will want to get married in a church but are't regular members of the congregation. As such they have to have meetings with the priest to make sure they are suitable and often the couple have to attend worship for a while in order to show they are committed. I believe this is true for christenings too and very often people do it to get their children into the faith school attached to the church. This is so well known that there's no way a clergyman can't spot these people, but I doubt very much that they ever think of confronting these people or refusing them any particular service because of this obvious deception. I would imagine it's encouraged, actually, because for one thing you have a large congregation to hand and also there's the obvious retention factor. But of course many homosexuals are Christians, or should I say many Christians are homosexuals, so that point is wrong from the start. The person who argues ""they can't be Christians"" is presenting the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy, of course.

So, to sum up my *very* long comment (sorry about that):

**TL;DR** Overall I see this issue as whether or not the state will sanction religiously motivated (or justified) prejudice.

2. The first half of Season 1 is a little rough.  It gets substantially better after that, around ""Dalek"" or ""Father's Day,"" and ""The Empty Child"" is one of the best of the entire series.

3. Don't forget to watch ""The Waters of Mars"" and ""The End of Time"" after you finish Season 4.  Netflix has them, but they're listed as their own movies, not as part of the series.  ""Planet of the Dead"" should go in there before ""Waters,"" but I don't think Netflix has that one on Instant.

4. If you're having a hard time getting into the show during Season 1, try starting with Season 5 instead.  But if you can stick it through to ""The Empty Child,"" I'd recommend watching it all.

5. Don't concern yourself with the pre-2005 stuff until you've watched all the new episodes.  Some may disagree with me there, but I think it's much easier to get into the modern show, then go back and watch the old stuff if you want (but you don't have to).",0,1328676386,null,0,false,0,c3p08n1,t3_pfdkr,t1_c3p08n1,t1_c3ozhnb,null,1428315276,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

This means that in all the times and places that the Time War existed, the war is still raging, but it can only have those moments, and they are inaccessible to creatures outside of the timelock. 

BUT, when Rassilon realized what was about to happen, he found a way to circumvent the timelock.  By using the Master as a beacon to connect the world of the Time War with the world without the Time War, the Time Lords could escape the lock.  Imagine the participants in the Time War like a fleet of ships out at sea.  They can see only the ocean in which they battle until someone fires up the lighthouse on the shore to guide the warring factions to the land.

The world of HP is based only around Magic. Mostly to make things easier, etc, but it's really just a different lifestyle from that of technology, futuristic or otherwise. Pretty much anything the magic could do you could do with pokemon and a little elbow grease or good training. Fly on a broomstick? Why not your favorite large flying type? Need light? try a fire or electric type. Need protection underwater? Bring your favorite water type. Thus pokemon win.

The Star Wars universe has a more limited scope of abilities than most of the others. Some mind tricks based on how strong or weak the will of the opponent is, some manipulation of objects without touching, and space travel, which, while interesting, probably is really expensive unless you have a lot of start up capital. Plus being bound into service for or against the jedi would get boring. So much bureaucratic bullshit. In any case Pokemon would negate everything but space travel, which wouldn't be nearly as prolific as some people would believe in the SW universe, I think. Pokemon Wins

As for traveling with the Doctor, sure you get to see a bunch of fun stuff for a year or two, but then it's over. How do you go back to normal life? Don't pull the ""if you could be with him forever"" bit, you all know it never happens. In any case, Pokemon would be more permanent, and so, win.

&gt;So, if we were to give religious reasoning credence for not allowing gay marriage, should we also 'not force' churches not to marry interracial couples?  
  
Personally speaking, my answer is yes, they should be legally allowed  to do that.  People should be free to do business (and marriage ceremonies are definitely business) with whoever they want, for whatever reasons they want.  If a church refuses to let me have a wedding there because I'm atheist, or fat, or white, or tall (and I am all of those things), then I feel that while I have a moral complaint, I shouldn't necessarily have a legal one.  If they decide to let me do it and then proceed to mistreat me because of those things, or if a place of employment won't hire me because of them, that's when I think legal protection should kick in, rather than when choosing who to enter into a contract with.  
  
I absolutely 100% support the notion of it being socially and morally unacceptable for them to make that decision, and I think it would be a better world if they just let gay marriage happen, but I believe quite strongly in their legal freedom to not allow it on their premises.

But I'm from the U.S., and where I used to live, we had ridiculous winters:  -20, several feet of snow, ice storms.  So I'm very familiar with winter driving preparations.

So, here's a list of things I'd recommend:

* All the basics I mentioned above, but make sure you've got plenty of it and that, for example, your jumper cables work and your spare tyre isn't flat.  Also, invest in a long-handled, heavy-duty ice-scraper, with a brush on it.  

* Stuff to let you survive: A warm blanket (or two), an extra pair of thick socks and gloves, a water bottle and maybe some snacks (e.g. a couple of energy bars)

*Stuff to get you out of a ditch: a snow shovel, de-icing salt, cat litter (the regular, cheap clay sort. It's for traction.) 

* Stuff to make life easier, generally:  lock de-icer/Isopropyl alcohol (for un-freezing locks, car doors and windscreens).  A cheap plastic tarpaulin or plastic painters' dropcloth (put it over your car when there's heavy snow expected).

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; the Chancellor said that the economy ""must be built on rewards for success"". 

The whole concept of rewards for success is really addictive, its how call of duty works. You get a massive kill streak and so they send in a helicopter and nukes to help you win even more. It makes it fun if you're playing against noobs or if you're really amazing but playing it competitively sucks, it sucks hard. The guys that are already rich just get given more stuff and the plebs are stuck with their regular pea shooters trying to fight against someone with nukes and helicopters. 

Ok, to be fair, it kind of works in COD because everyone is on a basically level playing field at the start of a match (there are slight differences but its still pretty good I think); if you think the game of life is anything close to a level playing field then you're either deluded or mentally deficient in some way.

Why should we reward successful people? This statement makes no sense, its pointless. ""Success is its own reward"" that statement doesn't need abstract evidence or even an argument to support it, its a Tautology (i.e. an unconditionally true statement).

What he means is ""we shouldn't punish the successful"". Which, if we read between the lines given that he is a free market Conservative,  basically means he wants to cut taxes for the rich. Which almost certainly won't do anything except make income inequality higher, which will lead to more crime, lower life expectancy, a less trusting society and a mercenary culture.

Tax isn't a punishment; its a leveller. It has the potential to make us all better off, gives us opportunity and allows us to live closer to our ideal freedoms. ",0,1328697115,null,0,false,0,c3p2ql1,t3_pg10q,t1_c3p2ql1,t3_pg10q,null,1428316455,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

 * Hi-viz jacket. Being seen while working out what went wrong with the car is important.
 * Mobile phone and car charger. Lets me call for help if needed; charger ensures I don't run out of battery at an inconvenient time.
 * Good warm blanket. If you're trapped in the cold with a broken down car, being able to wrap up in a nice blanket and keep warm is essential.
 * Small torch. Lots of uses once it gets dark.
 * Membership card for a rescue service (RAC in my case). If you're broken down, and it's not an easy fix, knowing that *someone* will come and get you (eventually) helps keep you sane.
 * CDs or other non-radio entertainment. Sod's law has it that if you get trapped by someone else breaking down, there will be nothing on the radio worth listening to.

In adverse weather conditions (snow, for example), I add the following - most of which are unnecessary, but if disaster hits, I want to be ready to cope with 6 to 12 hours waiting time for rescue:

 * Shovel. You never know when you might need to dig yourself out of trouble.
 * Thermos full of hot water, instant coffee (substitute something you're happy to drink without milk), sugar and travel cup. Again, useful if you get stuck - things can seem a lot more manageable after a hot drink.
 * Sensible snacks that won't go off. If the rescue services are overloaded, you can be stuck for hours.
 * Change of clothes. If you get soaked (e.g. coated in snow that then melts) while trying to repair the car, being able to change out of your sodden clothes into dry ones helps keep you warm.

Also in adverse weather, I refuel (to a full tank) at the 1/2 tank mark. If I'm stuck, being able to run the engine for heat and power without worrying about running out of fuel is nice.

Personally, I would like to see power given BACK to the monarchy so that there is a larger relationship between the monarch as the government.
You can say that we all vote for the Prime Minister and therefore he is a much better person to be in charge of our country, but every Prime Minister (except Thatcher) has gone to Eton, and thus had a similar upbringing and education as a member of the Royal Family. The only difference is that the Royal Family expect to be put in charge and are educated to do the best for their subjects. Most people in government however have chosen to be there, and for many that means paying and campaigning and generally telling people why they need to vote for them.
I'm not suggesting we demolish democracy but some of the power does need to be taken away from the Prime Minister. It scares me just how much they can do without much regulation. The know the idea is that they will be voted out if they fuck up but they can do a lot of damage in 5 years.

I did actually try and post the link from the MEN but it was flagged as spam for me??

Like I said in the other thread my concern is that this is quite near where I live and the bus I get home goes down Churchill Way.

Someone in the other thread mentioned about how it was all harmless fun and no harm came of throwing snowballs. They neglected to mention the part where the gang lifted up the bonnet cover of the bus and used the emergency stop button to prevent it from leaving.

They wanted to intimidate those people nothing less. I still believe these are the same people who will grow up to throw bricks at trains, drop rocks off motorway bridges and throw a dog or cat in a bag into a river. Same mentallity as I see it.

What can be done? Nothing unfortunately it's a viscious cycle as far as I'm concerned. They were brought up this way therefore they will bring their children up the same way...not knowing right from wrong.

It has nothing to do with ""bored youth"" or any other PC buzz word to explain this. I grew up in a small village with no ""youth centres"" or anything like that and not once did I throw bricks at buses or stand outside a shop at 12 years old trying to get people to buy me fags and booze. 

They're brought up by brainless thugs, they will become brainless thugs.

What will happen if they get caught? Nothing. They'll get community service or a slap on the wrists. Only to go out and do it again.

Spain have a better case than Argentina and that seems to be what they are banking on.

An unstable strategy is one that will eventually fail; if money is the only incentive based utility you think is worth measuring then you choose to live in a very strange world. A government can offer incentives in a multitude of ways that improve peoples lives that aren't directly related to how much things cost; free education is a great example of how society can be improved by individuals pursuit of knowledge yet we see academic institutions as big pits of money people should have to pay for because paying for things is how market believers think the world should work.

I'm not anti-making-money, It just needs to be balanced because income inequality is so harmful to society as a whole that individuals suffer as a result of the tax relief based strategies people cling to.

Norway, whilst not perfect, is a great example of a society that has high taxes, high rates of welfare and yet, somehow, they have lots of start-ups. If bonuses work for business, fine, but they are still salary and should be regulated and taxed as such. In fact, we should regulate and tax the shit out of them because, otherwise, we end up with huge income inequality.

Free market conservative politics finds the entire notion that welfare and high tax and enterprise can co-exist paradoxical. They are wrong in their assumptions and data from other western societies proves this. 

Competition certainly drives people, and people will compete for any resource they deem to be worth competing for with a strategy they think will succeed, money most definitely isn't the only resource (You could even argue that it isn't even perceived as an actual resource, its just a representation of other things) and it certainly isn't the most important resource; I argue we shouldn't build a society around competing for it but, rather, aiming for something better.",0,1328711004,null,0,false,0,c3p3tv4,t3_pg10q,t1_c3p3tv4,t1_c3p34xg,null,1428316964,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But when you start to talk of 'levelling' - to make everyone the same level - and later in your comments basically how governments should tax and use that to organise the resources of a country - well lets just say that it has never ever worked out for anyone when they tried. 

Your thoughts on how and why to reward successful people are total bull as well - of course money isn't the be all and end all, but you can't remove all incentives. Again, communism provides the example here - when there is no wealth incentive the whole model goes to pot, and corruption becomes rife.

Your ideas - although admittedly perfectly pitched for the reddit audience - are really confused, do you really know what entrepreneurs are like and what drives them? The answers are probably very simple: We need wealth incentives, just not too much. We need taxation, just don't go overboard and have the state redistributing everything. We need the social care system (esp health), just don't use it in place of working for a living. 

PS Comparing everything to Norway is silly - they have huge resource wealth per capita and a small and middle class demographic. Very different circumstances to most countries.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; But when you start to talk of 'levelling' - to make everyone the same level - and later in your comments basically how governments should tax and use that to organise the resources of a country...

I mean levelling in the sense of reducing the skew, variance, and spread of the distribution of wealth. I deliberately chose not to use statistical terms, though, because I don't have a reliable data set to formulate my arguments from.

&gt; Your thoughts on how and why to reward successful people are total bull as well - of course money isn't the be all and end all, but you can't remove all incentives.

Where did I talk about removing all intensives? Competition for a resource is the nature of all living things; what that resource is varies from system to system. Free education, for example at all levels has a significant economic cost to the individual (they could be out in the ""real world"" earning money) but allows people to change their lives in dramatic ways. 

&gt; Again, communism provides the example here - when there is no wealth incentive the whole model goes to pot, and corruption becomes rife.

Ok, I'm not a communist and I despise the idea of dictatorships as much as the next person but let me point this out:

Communism turned Russia from a oppressed peasants into a super power in a very short period of time. If you're arguing about what would give us a ""strong"" economy you have no further to look than this. So if you're using this to argue that state based systems don't work; the first man in space, and a hugely oppressive immensely powerful regime disagree with this. They could quite easily have won the cold war. 

If I were to argue for socialism, though (which I'm not doing), it wouldn't be that socialism is state control; Its not. It is about workers control, it is about individual worth within a community and escaping the oppression of those with large amounts of property. Wealth redistribution is the means by which this is achieved but it is not the desired goal state for the individuals that advocate socialism. 

&gt; PS Comparing everything to Norway is silly - they have huge resource wealth per capita and a small and middle class demographic. Very different circumstances to most countries. 

Ok, the other great example is Japan which has similar low levels of income equality to Norway but, instead of taxation and welfare, people are paid less at the top end this is a massive cultural thing related to a sense of responsibility. We're never going to be able to force executives to take a pay cut (or even make them act with responsibility to their work force as opposed to their shareholders) so higher taxes and lower levels of welfare seems like a pretty good example to me.

Yes. At no point was violence the response to what happened. There was a semblance of sympathy when there was a community lead march to the station and nothing else.

&gt;This all started when the police shot and killed someone. The locals were pissed but the general public heard the reports of him shooting at police and felt all was well. Turns out he did not shoot at the police, had no gun and the only shots fired were by the police. **Funny how this kind of fell off the radar isn’t it**.

No, it's not funny at all, and it was the violence that distracted from this and knocked it jarringly off the radar. Now contrast this with Doreen and Neville Lawrence. They stayed the same decent upstanding pair and beyond reproach in the public eye for near two decades, still able to draw on the nations sympathy long after people wanted to forget about the whole thing.

All the halls on the campus are catered in terms of food and cleaning, and there are a number of room types you can go for: shared study, shared room, en-suite, etc. These depend on your preference and budget. Mine worked out at about £135 per week. For the past couple of years I've rented a house, at £60 per week, but obviously not including bills, food etc. I'd recommend a catered hall as they are conveniently placed and reliable for a meal.

However, I read in another of the comments you have diet requirements, study law and use gyms. In this case, I would recommend Broadgate, located just to the west of the campus. The law building and the gym are on the west side of campus, so that will suit your needs just fine. Broadgate is self-catered, so your diet is up to you too, and is cheaper than catered halls! Broadgate is located near the suburb/town of Beeston, a delightful little place, which feels separated, but not isolated, from the main city yet is only a bus ride away. In Beeston there is a large Tesco and Sainsbury's for food, a number of bars/pubs/resturants, and places like Argos, and a few clothes places. It is also a relatively safe area, unlike some others in the city (Radford, St.Anns, Hyson Green, The Fields).

Another self catered hall is Raleigh Park in Lenton/Radford area. However, this is quite a trek from the Uni gym and Law building. And remember how I said about rougher parts of town, Raleigh Park is adjacent to one :/, though the rooms themselves are nice.

true,andyrocks,cnty-scotland,Kingdom of Clapham,"Do you mean air support or air cover? I think you mean air cover (the protection against enemy air forces).

I'm not (nor have ever been) in the military, so everything in this comment is pure amateur speculation.

Air cover would be much less of an issue in a future war than the previous one, due to the Type 45s. They really are exceptionally powerful warships, with much more ability than the old Type 42s. They can throw up a protective ""bubble"" around a task force to protect against air attack. [According the the NAO](http://www.nao.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docId=7bd5fcf1-c728-456f-8923-10d07ef2d170&amp;version=-1) one T45 can track and engage more targets than 5 T42s (and we sent 5 to the Falklands in 1982), and we have around 5 Type 45s (3 active, 2 fitting out) built right now, as well as 5 old Type 42s.

Also, our ships have much better ""point defense"" against missiles and attacking jets. The Close-in Weapon Systems (CIWS, the big Gatling guns you see on modern warships) were introduced after seeing what Exocets did to the Fleet in the Falklands. The short range AA missiles are also much improved from 1982.

The Argentine air force has been more or less untouched since 1982 - they have done little to maintain, never mind to enhance, their combat capability. They are more or less equivalent to the air force engaged in 1982.

As far as air support (i.e. aircraft involved in attacking ground targets), don't forget we now field the Apache, that can be flown from HMS Ocean. It was flown from Ocean in 2011 in support of the Libya campaign. They are much more powerful than the GR/3 Harriers we had in 1982, with much more powerful sensors and weapons. If we had an environment where they were able to operate safe from aerial attack, they would be devastating to ground forces.

One final thing to consider is the Tomahawk. We can launch these from submarines, and they can be used to disable runways in a manner unavailable in 1982. This would allow us to at least interfere with air operations from the mainland.

One thing that works against us is after 1982, we built RAF Mount Pleasant with full-length runways capable of operating fast jets. In the last war they could only operate smaller aircraft from the Islands, and this made a crucial difference as the fast jets had to fly in from the mainland, and by the time they arrived they did not have much fuel to fight. If Mount Pleasant was taken intact, we would likely have Mirages based there. 

As I've said, this is all my own amateur opinion. If anyone with some professional knowledge of these matters would like to comment I'd very much like to hear your opinion.",0,1328726054,null,0,false,0,c3p6kpz,t3_pfeh3,t1_c3p6kpz,t1_c3p5xu9,null,1428318326,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Our main concerns relating to the Bill and the Government's wider approach to NHS reform are:

*Speed of change and implementation*: The timetable for reform has been over ambitious. Major changes are taking place on the ground before the Bill has been passed.

*Complexity*: The Government is attempting to create a legislative framework for its NHS reforms whilst pursuing other policies in parallel that are separate from the Bill. There is complexity and a lack of coherence.

*Knock-on effects*: Unanswered questions remain in many crucial areas such as practical implementation and how individual components within the reforms will work together.

*Mismatch of reality and rhetoric*: There has appeared to be a divergence between the Government's overall stated direction of travel and what has transpired in reality.

&gt; Republicans claim that the total costs to taxpayers including hidden elements (e.g., the Royal Protection security bill) of the monarchy are over £100 million per annum.[22] The Daily Telegraph claims the monarchy costs each adult in Britain around 62p a year.[23] However, this figure does not take into account royal security, nor the money paid by regional councils to fund the costs of visits by members of the Royal Family, and assumes the ""official"" figure of £34m per annum to be divided between every man, woman and child in the land. Republic also argues that the Royal finances, which are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, are shrouded in secrecy and should be subject to greater scrutiny. Although monarchists argue that this does not take into account the 'hereditary revenues' which generated £190.8 million for the treasury in 2007-2008, republicans assert that the Crown Estate, from which these revenues are derived, is national and State property, and that the monarch cannot surrender what they have never owned.[24] The monarchy is estimated to cost British taxpayers £202.4m, when costs such as security are included, making it the most expensive monarchy in Europe and 112 times more expensive than the presidency of the Republic of Ireland.[25] The argument that tourism benefits from the continued existence of the British monarchy is refuted by Republic, who suggest that the reverse may actually be true - if the palaces were open throughout the year, tourists would be better able to visit them (as has happened with the Tower of London)[26]""",0,1328729336,null,0,false,0,c3p78zw,t3_pfz58,t1_c3p78zw,t1_c3p6yuo,null,1428318642,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Please tell me, what were the reason for the summer's riots? Was it oppression? … Lack of democracy? 

brunt2 may have a different opinion on this, but I think the recently-aired interview gives us a *really* good insight into the minds of these rioters.

One of them said [*""I wanted to see policemen being attacked, I wanted to see them being injured, I wanted to see them being treated the way they treat us. This was going to change society. Hopefully for the better.""*](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9050289/Wonderland-My-Child-the-Rioter-I-feel-as-though-I-lost-my-son.html)

I don't believe this was by any means a unique view. Urban youth come into contact with the plod *far* more frequently than you or I do, and I suspect their experiences average *far* more negative.

A London copper did an IAMA here shortly after the riots, and talked casually of how [he stops-and-searches young lads hanging out on the estate](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jh7f6/iama_police_officer_who_was_working_during_the/c2c3a9j?context=3). How is that fair or right? You or I can enjoy a beer in peace, politicians can enjoy a glass of wine or brandy as part of the Islington dinner-party experience, but if you're a teenager from Tottenham or Salford then your choice of intoxicant gives the police the right to hassle, arrest and imprison you. And whilst they do that, these cops can talk down to you and treat you like shit because they have the power, and you don't. 

Add to that wealth inequality: the richest 1% of the UK population have 21% of the nation's wealth - we can't even compare that to the poorest 1%, because the figures don't go down that far [[PDF](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/personal_wealth/13-5-table-2005.pdf)]. All we do know is that the poorest 50% of the population have only 7% of the wealth between them - let's get that straight, that's on average *one hundred and fifty times poorer*, and we haven't approached the council estates yet - in the poorer 50% are still many who have a car and a job and prospects, you and I, perhaps. We can only guess that the richest 1% are 1000x wealthier than the poorest 1%, and most in these two categories are born to it. 

These kids are not *entirely* stupid - they can see they're getting the shitty end of the stick here. 

So, yeah, we might not be talking about Syrian levels of oppression, but I don't think democracy is representing these kids. If you're here on Reddit, fortunate, reasonably well-educated - maybe you have a second property on which you derive income, or you have a degree, maybe these are merely things you aspire to - then maybe you feel that our democracy represents you very well.

As far as these kids are concerned, they may be lucky if they know both their parents, school didn't really work for them, either because they were troublemakers or because everyone else was, making for such a distraction the teachers couldn't get a word in edgeways. So what do they have to look forward to? 40 years of stacking shelves at Tesco, if they're lucky - the rest of their life is a choice between that &amp; the dole. Not very exciting, is it? Not when you can turn on daytime TV and see how the other half lives, property hunting on the mediterranean. 

Democracy doesn't represent these kids, because they have a choice between the tories and the Tony Blair brand tories - the same political status quo that has been running things the last 20 or 30 years, since before they were born. Maybe they can't articulate that, but I really do think that's what's going on here.",0,1328729344,null,0,false,0,c3p791v,t3_pg7gs,t1_c3p791v,t1_c3p57bl,null,1428318643,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For instance, we were stopped once when I was with my friend in his car. There were three of us in total on our way to the cinema. We're all young males, about 19 or 20 at the time, and the car was a Peugeot 206 (basically, we probably fitted the stereotype fairly well). Anyway, there was absolutely no actual reason to suspect us of anything, but one of the coppers still proceeded to breathalyse the driver while another came around to the passenger side to talk to me and my other friend. He asked us where we were going so I told him we were just on our way to the cinema. Then he asked what we were going to see and because I said we didn't know yet (which was the truth), he started trying to insinuate a load of bullshit in a rather accusing tone: ""That's very spontaneous, isn't it? You know spontaneity can lead to speeding..."" or some shit like that. I was just like k mate.  
  
Meanwhile, the other copper is trying his hardest to find something wrong with the car. My mate had custom tail lights (those clear ones you always see on 206s) and he was trying to suggest they were illegal. Failing that one, he moved onto what is the most minor criticism I have ever heard about a car; the little boot handle that overhangs the rear licence plate lamps was partially broken, meaning that the light could supposedly glare at following drivers. Of course that would be a legitimate issue, but we're talking about a tiny bulb and the handle/cover thing was only broken at the end, so he was drastically exaggerating the problem. The next thing he said was simply golden. After instructing him to make sure he gets that fixed ASAP, he asked my mate where he lives and warned him that ""he goes through that road all the time"", and that he'll keep an eye out to see he gets  it sorted. Here's the kicker: THE ROAD IS A CULL DE SAC!!!

Hundred per cent - don't disagree with this at all.  He never rejected non-violence; but he certainly qualified it:

&gt;""As I have walked among the desperate, rejected and angry young men I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they asked -- and rightly so -- what about Vietnam? They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today -- my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.""

But, meanwhile, the FBI were busy putting down the violent protestors who they genuinely feared whilst MLK was in pacifist mode.  Indeed, declassified documents make this point quite clearly:

&gt;“Prevent the RISE OF A ‘MESSIAH’ who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement. Malcolm X might have been such a ‘messiah;’ he is the martyr of the movement today. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael and Elijah Muhammed all aspire to this position. Elijah Muhammed is less of a threat because of his age. King could be a very real contender for this position should he abandon his supposed ‘obedience’ to ‘white, liberal doctrines’ (nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism.""

&gt;“This is of primary importance, and is, of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should also be a goal of the Counterintelligence Program to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence”

.

Time will tell on that one.  I certainly don't think shopping with attitude is particularly anti-capitalist, but I don't dismiss the anger.  It just needs more focus.

true,andyrocks,cnty-scotland,Kingdom of Clapham,"&gt;  but they can't protect the marines/paras on the islands from airstrikes if they're miles away guarding the rest of the fleet

Sure they can. They're designed to do that - check out the NAO link in my comment - ""can extend its protective air-defence shield over British 
Forces engaged in a land battle"". Granted it's not in the same league as proper air cover, but it's really pretty good against Argentine technology.

&gt; If they're inshore, ground clutter negates the long range of the radar keeping them virtually blind unless an obliging aircraft flying low actually comes within visual range

Why would they be inshore? They are air defense destroyers. Their job would be as picket ships to intercept attacks before they made it to the islands - more or less the same role as the Type 42s had. In 1982 the ships that closely supported the landing tended to be the smaller frigates. The Type 42s were stationed on approach routes.

&gt; Of course, if we still had short range AWACS planes flying from a deck nearby, it would help; but we don't have any. I would love to be proved wrong BTW.

All we had in 1982 was Sea Kings, no proper AWACS. I have no idea if we still fly the early warning helicopters.

However I do think there needs to be some proportion. Racism is very undesirable but we have to keep it in perspective. Firstly whatever he said to another player it is just that. Words. Are we really to conclude that saying something to another player is worse than head-butting them? Would Terry have been stripped of his captaincy if he had head-butted someone when playing for Chelsea?

I think the risk we run here is that we get so blinded by this idea that saying something racist to someone on a football pitch is so bad that it creates animosity with people who are borderline racist and isolates them on the wrong side of the fence. 

I'm not sure that hanging Terry out to dry will convince people. When I do see racism in the UK, which is certainly not rare, it's done in a context where the person knows they can get away with it.

The fact is the police are often cunts to many people especially the MET.

The police (as a force) also repeatedly asked the Labour government to re-classify cannabis back to class B (cunts) , this now means that someone 'can' get up to 5 years for possession of a herb - they so daily sweeps of train stations in London under the guise of fighting terrorism whilst knowing they will mainly find just dope (what a fucking waste of MY money that is)

They repeatedly try to influence government policy (they should never do this) and supported the loss of various rights under the Labour government.

If anyone has watched any of the police camera action type programs that just reaffirms the typical view of the police as nasty, uneducated wankers I always knew they were.

I grew up in these environments.

[Why would they be inshore? They are air defense destroyers. Their job would be as picket ships to intercept attacks before they made it to the islands - more or less the same role as the Type 42s had.]

4 destroyers, (assuming any 2 were in refit), are going to intercept airstrikes from any possible direction around the Falklands AND cover the rest of the fleet when their radar will cover only a 30 mile radius for low flying aircraft? I don't think so.

Don't forget, most S. American countries will assist Argentina with technology and hardware, (Peru handed them a squadron of fighters in 1982).

""It's been a while since I checked in, and considering my current major work project I thought I'd drop a post in too. I'll probably get a clip round the ear, but what the hell. I'm the lead technical implementer of this.

I'm first going to say, it was announced on Facebook as Easter, this happened unbeknown to me. It was based on an initial time scale set last year before procurement happened, spending public money is hard and at that point we had a delay.

I was talking to my boss this afternoon and we've decided to still target Easter for the initial installation of the new equipment (was meant to be December on the initial plan). This may or may not include ResNet at the installation point, we need to sit and work through a lot of things first. The primary issue is what do we do about your Quota's, by default in the brave new world all your web and iPlayer would start to count too. We need to address this one way or another, that being said I don't go through 30Gb/month at home, I buy two or three games a month from Steam and watch a fair bit of iPlayer (well let's be honest, my partner does).

To give you an idea of the scale of work we're essentially restructuring and reimplementing our entire network security architecture for nearly 18000 wired clients and 8000 wireless clients. So a disclaimer if it doesn't happen by then, don't blame me, I'm working on it... In the long run:

Things should return to the same speeds they used to be at, the web will probably fee a little less latent then it did before. The web caches will be gone, it won't just be transparent. The same TCP connection your computer makes will be the one that arrives at the server. It'll still being inspected and logged, but other then NAT we wont modify it.

We will still have the ability to block sites that pose a threat (malware, phishing, etc.), connections headed to these sites will be intercepted, I don't know exactly how that works at the moment. I've only started to configure that bit of kit today. Those connections might be meddled with, but in all likelihood it wont effect much legitimate stuff.

So yes, anything without a proxy setting or anything that does any strict IP checking should start to work. People can guess and stab at what it might fix, I don't want to say in case people take it for gospel.

We'll be taking our connection to the internet up to 2x10Gbps as well around install time, our current connection is not why you're going slow though, we don't average near our 3Gbps limit atm. 2x10Gbps is just a big ""wow"" number.

LU does a lot of data intensive research, did ya see we recently helped discover a new particle? The uplift in speed helps us get data from places like CERN about a lot quicker.

The new infrastructure will not fix the ""Strict NAT"" problem which can affect Xbox Live, I think the problem will lessen a little bit, but it wont be gone. I've said it before, I'll say it again, we run enterprise kit, it doesn't do consumer stuff like UPNP. There isn't a piece of equipment that does that runs at the speeds we need.

Please believe we do care about the student experience, in fact that term comes up in most conversations we have these days, but we're bound by the speed at which we can change things, buying stuff and changing policy is slow and very frustrating (policy in particular). If we identify something we need to buy and it's costly we may have to put it in a budget for a year or two away, etc.

We're also bound by what's technically possible, many things are easy when it's for a single house or maybe 20-30 people, but once you factor it up to 6000 residents it often becomes a very large problem to solve. A good example of this is the ""Strict NAT"" issue.

I would release a boring picture of the equipment in the test lab I took this evening, but I probably would get into trouble for that. Being a set of security devices we probably wouldn't release the info via an FOI request, so probably shouldn't give it away on a forum either. I'll error on the side of caution, don't want to be told never to post again.

Honest we're working on it!

Now really tongue in cheek... ""you young whipper snappers don't know how good you've got it, back when I were your age, we had 2mbs between 600 of us, and we had the original Napster to deal with""... 12 years ago... fond memories.

I would of course be one up'd by people in my office for this, one of them would claim they had to go to labs for internet, another would remember having to ship a large operating system from University to Home on 720k floppy disks. There is also the story of the Pendle Floor Drillers, a bunch of guys who lived above the Pendle lab drilled through the floor and ran their own data line into the comms cabinet when ResNet didn't exist. Yes they got into bother for that one.""

Personally, i think if you're not planning on committing a crime, you've got no reason to cover your face (at a protest; i dont want to see local paper boys arrested for covering their faces from the cold in winter). This is the view that the police take and that's why they work as closely as possible with organisers to stop faces being covered.

Take football matches as an example. They have a famous history of fights and riots. For this reason, you aren't allowed to cover your face, at high risk games you must have your name on your ticket (so they can look at the records later and find out who went), you can't drink alcohol in view of the pitch, and people with a history of rule breaking or known associates of the old 'firms' are thrown out. This has stopped all but very rare instances of fighting. The rules have worked, and as at protests you simply can't get details of who is there with a record, you need to be able to see faces.

I will, however, agree with you to an extent on it being stupid for it to be an offence simply to be there. I fully supported the protest camp outside of St Pauls, because they worked closely with the cathedral to ensure the church could operate normally. Let people protest their views, let them chant and march down the streets of London- it's their right to, but they must follow rules, and if they can't follow them, they'll get punished, and covering your face so you can't be identified is rightly a crime at a protest.",0,1328741368,null,0,false,0,c3p9r2o,t3_pg7gs,t1_c3p9r2o,t1_c3p9gtw,null,1428319826,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Really? How? As I recall, the proto-Pakistanis threatened civil war if the British left India unpartitioned. Would you have preferred Civil War? Have India's wars with Pakistan still not convinced you that they really do want their own country?

&gt; Also Churchill's policies were responsible for two of the biggest famines Mankind has ever seen during WW2 in Bengal. While you treat him as some kind of a hero in UK.. 

I've just had a [read](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943#Background_and_possible_causes) about this. What do you think he is responsible for, exactly? The tidal waves? The cyclones? The fungus epidemic? Or the loss of rice-exporting Burma to the Japanese? 

Churchill did a lot of morally dubious stuff during his life, such as forming the Black and Tans, the Gallipoli campaign, the deliberate loss of Coventry, or the fire bombing of Dresden.. so I don't think you actually know just how just how the British feel about him. He *was* voted out of office immediately after the war, you know. 

&gt; ..don't ever forget this fact that your country prospered and funded their entire War budget using India's resources. 

No, it was mainly funded by massive loans from the Americans, which the UK only just finished paying off. 

You don't fund a war with direct taxation during the war, you fund it with loans and war bonds, which get paid off over the years after the war has ended - and as India left the Empire shortly after the war, it didn't have too much to do with paying the bill.

&gt; Thousands of Indian Soldiers died fighting for the British during the World Wars without having even given much credit.

Indian soldiers were largely confined to fighting in India and the far East in campaigns such as the [Burma campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Slim,_1st_Viscount_Slim). Unfortunately, even the British soldiers in that theatre referred to themselves as ""the forgotten Army"", as the fighting there was not seen as important as that going on in North Africa or Europe. So, if there is any truth to the claim that Indian soldiers didn't get much credit, it's not because they were Indian, it's because of where they fought. 

EDIT: Ah, I just found this [Time article](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2031992,00.html). If accurate, there is another morally dubious set of choices to be laid at Churchills feet. It looks like the famine was going to happen anyway, but Churchills actions made it far worse.

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance.

Moffat works for BBC Television in London/Cardiff. The movie is being developed by BBC Worldwide, a Los Angeles-based company whose job is to license BBC properties to American studios and networks to distribute or make American versions of. If a big budget blockbuster movie is going to happen, it's going to be a joint production with a big American studio, probably Warner Bros since Yates has a working relationship with them. If so, they're going to be calling most of the shots. Yates and BBC Worldwide already said that they don't want the movie associated with the TV show, which means it'll be Yates' baby and Moffat will have jacksquat to do with the production.

I don't even think the movie's going to happen for at least another 5-10 years since it sounds like one of those projects that's bound to be stuck in development hell while they decide which direction to reboot it to. Hell, it might even be scrapped in 3 years. But thinking that it's just a rumored phantom project *because Moffat says so* is silly.

Of course parents should be asked for consent for this, just as they are for everything else. And as with vaccinations, the only ones who would refuse consent would be the idiots who follow some twisted moral code. However going behind parents' backs on this is both unethical and dangerous as they need to be aware of this in case of any side effects.

Sexual education should focus on the importance of preventing STDs, the need to remove the device when they decide to try to conceive and the fact that no method of contraception is 100% reliable so it's best to use a condom. No abstinence bollocks, that's just wishful thinking by deluded fools.

The problem is given the chance these people will do more than just offend.  We know this because we've seen it happen.

There are plenty of people around that will have fond memories of black/white taps, total segregation, being able to beat the shit out of niggers and having no worries about being arrested.  Lynching was an acceptable practise not that long ago.

There's a reason it's such a touchy subject, there's a LOT of nasty brutal history of treating none white people as less than human and it's still rampant today here and across the world.

It's bigger than just simple name calling.  And while no law will stop morons being racist, thankfully it might shut them up.  They spread hate, fear and violence with this so called ""sticks and stones"".  Can't say I have any pity for racists being convicted.

Their friends, wives, husbands, children, parents, don't you think they rely on services, the NHS, schools, universities too?  

The disgusting debacle that followed it however, the students and the troublemakers that turn up with anything from Molotov cocktails, pooltable balls, throwing paint and fireworks, making bonfires in London, you name it, breaking shop fronts,  they were at an illegal protest and the 'students' that broke away from the official protest, and in direct contrast to it, behaved shockingly.  The police have a duty to protect the people not protesting too and these 'protesters' showed their contempt for not only the law, but for other people and the law abiding protests of earlier in the day, and apparently you were one of them.

53 protesters were treated for injuries, another 13 were police officers.

Watch your own frustrating video link.  She doesn't make a sensible argument, she comes across badly, immature even when a comparison is made to the protests in Egypt, and the video footage that she did take - I'm not surprised she didn't show much in her rant even though she would have had her phone with her all the time - backs up what I've just said, as does this BBC article.
