In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule, you see. Why should we change now, when it's worked so well?


**Hacker**: That's all ancient history, surely?

**Sir Humphrey**: Yes, and current policy. We 'had' to break the whole thing [the EEC] up, so we had to get inside. We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn't work. Now that we're inside we can make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing: set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch. The Foreign Office is terribly pleased; it's just like old times.

**Hacker**: But surely we're all committed to the European ideal?


**Sir Humphrey**: [chuckles] Really, Minister.

**Hacker**: If not, why are we pushing for an increase in the membership?


**Sir Humphrey**: Well, for the same reason. It's just like the United Nations, in fact; the more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes.


**Hacker**: What appalling cynicism.

They might not even realise they are disturbing anyone. If i was in their situation I would pissed off and resent you for going straight to the police/council with an official compliant before even trying to communicate your grievance with me. 

Think of it this way - what would you respond more positively to? (think from their position) 

Example A:

They are casually playing games, oblivious to disruption - then they get a police visit and complaint because some neighbor complained, now they have a warning/fine or whatever - this would piss me off and make me want to find out who the neighbor was.

Example B:

They are casually playing games, oblivious to disruption. Then a friendly neighbor stops by - engages in some conversation, gets to know them and mentions that they don't mind them playing CoD (and that they love the game as well) but it's just a bit loud and asks maybe they could turn it down, especially the base.

What would you respond better to? Influence them into making them not wanting to disturb you because you are a friend/neighbor.

The sad thing is that conversationally, I can't distinguish between a 16 year old and a 20 year old, for the most part. That's possibly due to where I like to hang out, but judging by the other bars / clubs around where I live, mine's above average.

While I understand that, for lack of a better word, intelligence isn't likely to be truly represented on your first encounter with somebody, people in clubs as a whole are pretty dumb. They live in a never ending cycle of social politics, with little to no foresight as to what they want in life.

15 year olds buy into this (what I call the high school mentality) and it just perpetuates throughout university and onto their future workplaces.

&gt;T-Moible and Orange do but they're still utter shite. I had to call five different people to get my internet working when I tried to use my iPhone on T-Mobile. Similar deal with Orange.

Haven't had a problem with T-Mobile CS (whose first line support is in the Phillippines I think), although I don't like Orange's CS because they wouldn't talk to me as they thought I sounded ""too young"" to be me. That's surprising considering I have a pretty deep voice and people often think I'm much older than I really am. This was, IIRC, their Plymouth call centre.

Doesn't even touch on how she does almost the same thing to her mother...

Having a moral compass when it comes to randomness out in your fantasy universe (imagine if you could travel like in doctor who, things would seem completely unreal to you, you could become almost a character in your own life.) is one thing, but it really is how you treat those closest to you that matters most.

Just the way she treats her mother and Mickey is enough for me to not like her but when I start to look into the story more I like it less and less. 

She seems to only fall in love with the doctor after he gets pretty, opting to flirt with other characters in the show in favor of the doctor before his transformation. Choosing to disregard consequences in order to gain something for herself in just about every example.

And then we have acting that I don't like, but I don't like to use that as an arguing point against a character. Though it does make it harder to like Rose in general.

When you claim expenses back against your tax bill, you're avoiding tax. You could not claim and thus pay more tax than you have to. But again,  people don't. Hell, even buying duty free when you're going on holiday is tax avoidance.

If anything we should resist the pressures from the commercial industries, housing etc.. that say we must buy our own place or rent as soon as we get the chance.

You look at most places in the world, including mainland Europe, people stay with their parents much longer anyway.

That's what the Tories are saying, and it doesn't make any sense to me.

I keep Cameron using the word ""fair"", but we cannot have a fair society when we have some people born rich and others are born poor.

If you had been arrested for some idiotic teenage mischief, you'll have had a very different experience if your parents can afford a decent solicitor than if you were born on a council estate. Not only is that unjust in itself, but experiences like this shape our lives and the consequences of them snowball. 

""They should have to work for a living"" is a Tory narrative so ingrained in us that we no longer question it. You read that now, and you don't even have to question who the sentence is referring to - benefits scroungers.

2 was trapped when attempting to save his midget companion from Cybermen, who grabbed a hold of his PJ's and injected him with some vile liquid that instigated regeneration. The Cybermen would have killed him, and his regeneration energy not overloaded the circuits. His companion had already been turned. The key for unlocking the midget was on a shelf high above him.
3 was killed by Sontarons when they detonated a nuclear warhead the size of a planet (spoiler, the planet that the TARDIS landed on was the warhead) as the TARDIS was escaping, causing systems to zero out and have 3 crash land. During this, his mother has been thrown into the TARDIS's timey-wimey areas, causing her to be lost for a bit.
4 dies when his socks give him fungal infections (from lack of being washed, but actually turns out that the fungus is only deadly to Time Lords and it was planted in his shoes by a Cyber Mat.).
5 dies when he ends up saving a Republic Star Cruiser from an evil menace aboard a large ship; he destroys the reactor bay and the radiation initiates regeneration. (I'm thinking Star Wars special)
6 has a love interest with this male companion, but it turns out that he was a slave to the Daleks about mid-series. At the end, the companion comes back, and stabs the Doctor in the back and wounding one of his hearts, both physically and emotionally.  The companion dies because he his hit by the regeneration energy.
7 dies when he encounters acid rain on the forest planet, when the weather control system malfunctions causing chaos and natural disasters to wreak havoc on the planet. His companion saves his body (thus allowing him to regenerate) by running into the control room and shutting everything down, but in the process he must combine his neural energy with the computer or the computer will shut down (leaving the disasters to keep occurring). 
8's girlfriend ends up being that one lady who tries to raise Adipose babies. After she is trapped by the Adipose overlords, he goes to save her-but finds out that she has been sent back in time to tell her younger self not to raise Adipose babies. Knowing that this could cause a paradox, the Student goes back to stop her-and it's too late. The paradox overwhelms the TARDIS, and he crashes (again). Barely after his girlfriend tells her younger self not to raise Adipose babies, he arrives, and they hug each other. This causes a crack to form in space-time. He separates the two, and when he does, they both disappear (because the universe has just fixed the paradox by erasing her from history. Because the Student was there, he still remembers, but technically none of it ever happened).  8 dies when the TARDIS, still recovering, lands him on a water based planet and suffers from Pressure Sickness (his body couldn't handle the difference in pressure from above water and below).
9 comes to, and awakens to find a much older version of his mother hovering over him, caring for him in a bed on the water planet (they are now in, basically, Atlantis). Because she was trapped in the TARDIS, she didn't really ever die, so (if the actress was still around) she would be the same-looking. They end up travelling back in Time to pre-Historic Earth, land of the dinosaurs (with references to Dinosaurs on a Spaceship), because they receive a distress call...from a Time Lady. They encounter his sister. The Silurians are none to happy to have ape-like creatures on their planet, and in the end all three of them regenerate in a battle with them-but the sister is killed mid-regeneration.

In comparison, Barca dropped points against Betis, Villareal, Espanyol, Getafe, and Sociedad - all bottom half teams. 

So, yes, the EPL has more teams clustered around the top - but the top teams usually lose to each other, not to the bottom half of the league. La Liga is a two-horse race, sure, but the rest of the league is much more evenly matched - the difference between third place and relegation was 20 points, as opposed to 35 in the EPL.

I don't think it is incorrectly labeled.  I actually think it is pretty well labeled.  The three Doctors.  Well let's take a look shall we?  How many men are in this picture?  Three.  And (we are all Doctor Who fans, otherwise why would we be here) we know all three of them were/are the Doctor in some form of reincarnation.  So, my question is a two parter for you.  How exactly is it incorrectly labeled?  (He did say The three Doctors, not The *only* three Doctors).  And how would you correctly label it? (I mean maybe you could say ""The three new Doctors"" or ""The three Doctors since the Reboot"" or even ""10,9, 11"" because they aren't in order here.  But all of this, aside from the last which is kind of silly sounding, are long and verbose and no one likes that in a subject line of a Reddit post.)  So how would *you* label it in order for it to be ""correct""?

OC?  Not aware of this term.  But no, I wasn't defending it as PC.  I was defending it because it's really obnoxious that every time someone says anything about the three new Doctors and doesn't mention 1-8 there is inevitably that person (or people most of the time) who flip his/her (their) shit because ""don't you know there was Doctor Who before 2005?"".  Of course we know.  It wouldn't make sense for a show to make up that much history and start with his 9th reincarnation and have us suspend our disbelieve that much.  Just because we say something about the Doctors we know doesn't mean we aren't aware of the history.  You calling this guy out about that is like, hmmm....let's see.  It's like someone telling you Hitler was an evil dictator and you saying, ""Well, so was/is Stalin and Tojo and al-Gaddafi.""  Absolutely they are, but that wasn't what that person was talking about.  And if you are talking about or referring (maybe not explicitly, but come on, we are smart enough to understand context) to the reboot then you aren't really talking about Doctor Who prior to 2005.  

And lastly guy, stop being butt hurt when you know it's the truth.  Go onto any thread with the three new Doctors and you will see over and over again, ""stop forgetting about 1-8"" in some form or another.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"Well you'll have to be very intelligent for a start (believe it or not). You'll have to be likeable enough to be elected as an mp for a major party and then do a good job at being an mp (sorting out your constituency etc). You'll then be a backbencher in the house of commons. You then have to do all sorts of powerplaying, persuading, intimdiating, probably blackmailing to become a prominent member of your party with support from fellow MPs. You'll then have to either wait for your leader to step down or challenge him for leadership. In either case, you'll have to be extremely ruthless in attacking your opponents whilst appearing to be nice, clam and polite to the media and the rest of the party. If you can do this, with a huge heap of luck as well, you can become party leader. Now you have to wait for a general election whilst making the current prime minister looks as terrible as possible (without appearing mean or vicious), run your election campaign as wella s possible and hopefully win. You are now Prime Minister. 

This will take many years, you won't win the confidence of your fellow mp's until you've been a member of the cabinet a few times. In the distant past, when there was a smaller electorate (only wealthy men could vote), it was easier (Pitt the Younger notably got elected when he was 24). But David Cameron was the youngest prime minister for around 200 years when he got in (aged 43). So it takes quite a while.


EDit: Basically you have to be all things. You have to be kind, but strong. You have to be ruthless and cruel enough to ruin your opponents but able to spin the media and your party to appear kind, honourable and full of integrity. This isn't just when you are in a general election, this starts from when you decide to become an MP. You'll have to appear humble to people who haven't worked a day in their life when you work 24/7. You can't swear, make rude jokes, do anything which would ruin your reputation. You have to have an incredible eye as to who you appoint as main supporters (who would become your cabinet) as they can't have any issues, problems or mistakes either. You'll have to suffer the media hounding you all the time. You'll have to suffer your opposition and your mp's questioning you constantly. You'll have to suffer responsibility for things completely out of your control. You'll have to break most of your moral principles because its necessary for the well being/security of the country, and even though it was the right decision, you will be cursed for it.

Of course DC says he's going to support  and protect the NHS, he's not likely to turn around and say something like 'Oh I don't know what you're all making a fuss about, just use your private health insurance like I do' is he?


The measurement I'm basing my comment on is direct observation. My daughter accesses a number of services such as physio, speech and occupational therapy, and in all 3 of these areas, the staff are more stretched than they were a couple of years ago because they are having to cover a greater caseload with less staff.

I'm afraid that the claim made by the coalition folks that there will be no detrimental effect on frontline services in the NHS seems to be no more than a claim. I'm not aware of any evidence indicating it's true. I actually see evidence to the contrary when trying to ensure my bairn gets the same level of services she's previously enjoyed.

&gt; They got a £500m increase in budget this year. It's only considered a 'cut', because they were supposed to get £900m originally. 

Seeing as how the NHS as a whole has been ordered to save £20 billion in the next 2 years, that's a big cut, or so it seems to me.

It's a pretty weird case - the Guardian did print that and News International don't seem to have been aggressive about denying it.

But the story *seems* to come down to the isCharlotteChurchLegalYet website and a *Sun* reporter asking Charlotte Church's mum for a quote on the subject. 

It seems like Church's mum either misunderstood at the time, or the events were misremembered when the account was given at the Levinson Enquiry (following which *The Sun* was indeed furiously denounced by *The Guardian*).

The heresycorner.blogspot links to the [wayback machine cache of the site](http://web.archive.org/web/20020209014735/http://www.geocities.com/enchantedgeneration/charlottechurch.html) and if you [look at the page source](http://i.imgur.com/qIvtH.png) you can see it *was* counting down to her 16th birthday. You can also find [William at Popbitch admitting responsibility](http://web.archive.org/web/20020205161450/http://www.popbitch.com/i/am/william).

I would be delighted if heresycorner.blogspot was proven to be a News International shill and that this was all part of a cunning Murdock cover-up, but so far I don't believe it. I just think someone would have turned up a copy of the newspaper or a screenshot of *The Sun*'s website if it had happened - I admit I haven't looked into this too hard, but I would have thought that such evidence would be top google hit, had *The Sun* actually run such a countdown.

The newspaper countdown that *did* genuinely occur is that of the model Linsey Dawn McKenzie. She started bikini modelling at the age of 15, already then GG bra size, and send her portfolio to the *Sunday Sport* who *did* do a countdown for her 16th birthday, and who did then publish topless photos of her when she  came of age. (This is cited on her wikipedia page)

So I think this story is promulgated because it's ""just the sort of thing that skeezy newspaper would do"" - all these similar events happened but not, in fact, quite the way people like to tell it. Thus everyone's happy to believe it without question.

There was a countdown to Charlotte Church's majority, but it wasn't *The Sun*. There was a newspaper countdown to ""is she legal yet"", but it was a different newspaper and it wasn't Charlotte Church.

Charlotte Church may have suffered in other ways at the hands of *The Sun* - I believe they made a legal settlement with her recently - so perhaps that's why she's misremembering. ",0,1350159001,null,0,false,0,c6lz1ci,t3_11emtt,t1_c6lz1ci,t1_c6lyc1z,null,1430139201,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,geekchic,null,null,"If you do some research though - firstly, to secure certification, medical trials have to be carried out, and paid for, and it has long been the case that a large chunk of the cost of drugs is due to the lengthy trials process.

Quite obviously the price will rise as a result of that extra cost - but there is no indication in the Independent newspaper (the source of the story that blog rewrote) to explain where a 2000% price rise is coming from.

For anyone knows - it will go up by 20% or 2 million percent. No one knows.

The drug supply has also been cut off - but that is what medical practice requires when formal trials are undertaken - especially with a modified version of the drug, as is the case here. It's government red tape causing that decision.

However, this is a marginal drug used by few patients due to its rather unpleasant side effects, and most doctors expect to be prescribing Tysabri or the forthcoming BG-12 pill.

The idea that it will cost the NHS an additional £237 million per year seems to have as much foundation in fact as the claims that the price will rise 20 fold.

You would be better at directing your ire at the high costs of testing drugs and the often overly demanding safety requirements that often results in modestly decent drugs being binned because the side effects in some patients were too bad - but in the majority of patients, it was actually perfectly usable.

I take drugs to stay alive, and they have side effects. I'd rather have side effects and be alive than be denied the drugs because some idiot complained that the side effects were unpleasant.

Ok, cool, we need these sort of discussions before we really get going - the fallacy in the nts fallacy is a fallacy of a changing definition - someone trying to change terms halfway through an argument.

What is a christian?  You believe it is simply to believe in God and a resurrection and to follow the teachings of Jesus.  I don't think this is too far wrong, actually.  In fact I'm not sure why you thought I was NTSing.  Someone who identifies as christian simply because it's the ""decent thing to do"" despite not believing isn't a christian by your definition, and therefore by me calling them not really christian I am not committing the NTs fallacy, am I?

So as far as how it was handled in classic Who by other Time Lords, I don't have a lot of perspective. The only classic Who regeneration I've seen is 3 to 4 and they are two very different Doctors. 

It's possible that it feels that way for the Doctor and not other Time Lords because he seems to be the only Time Lord shown in the show to have an emotional connection with anyone who is not a Time Lord (ie his human companions). That connection might make each of his forms feel more like separate individuals since they have people who they are attached to who are both mortal and do not change form. 

This would explain 10s stronger to connection to that specific form since he was so deeply invested in so many people. ",0,1350165150,null,0,false,0,c6m0cfs,t3_11f7tr,t1_c6m0cfs,t1_c6lzgjk,null,1430139821,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt; If we assume that each one is a planet, that brings us to 706 planets around 100,000 stars. Since our galaxy has around 200 billion stars, we can figure out that there ought to be — wait for it — at least 1.4 billion planets in our galaxy!

Let's say there's a quadrillion to one chance of intelligent life on planet. A number completely pulled out of my backside but is so small most would consider it a ""miracle"" of biblical proportions if something of that likelihood actually happened.

Well, the universe is pretty [big](http://www.universetoday.com/30305/how-many-galaxies-in-the-universe/):

&gt; This is a difficult number to know for certain, since we can only see a fraction of the Universe, even with our most powerful instruments. The most current estimates guess that there are 100 to 200 billion galaxies in the Universe, each of which has hundreds of billions of stars. A recent German supercomputer simulation put that number even higher: 500 billion. In other words, there could be a galaxy out there for every star in the Milky Way.

Even with my incredibly long shot odds, there are still millions of civilisations like ours that have existed/exist in the universe.

My view is that the evidence suggests that the odds are much shorter than quadrillion to one and the universe is probably teaming with life.",0,1350166500,null,0,1350166978,0,c6m0mce,t3_11f5on,t1_c6m0mce,t1_c6lxkxi,null,1430139960,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

The brain cells are reorganised in every case, but maybe more so following a damaging cause.

The Doctor demands to know where the silence are. the doctor gets a crew together to fight the silence, who he knows are a formidable opponent. he beautifully conquers the base without killing anyone. he tries to find out what they were doing. while trying to find out, the silence spring the trap, revealing that they had the upper hand even when the doctor appeared to be winning. the headless monks surround and nearly kill everybody. the good guys escape.

makes perfect sense to me.

&gt;Bring up a bunch of silly stuff (The Clerics, The Headless Monks)

I think you have convinced yourself that the clerics and the headless monks are silly. they aren't. the silly clerics lull the doctor into a false sense of security, and then the silly headless monks kill his friends. The clerics and headless monks are serious enemies that can almost convince the doctor to allow himself to die (from the first half of 'The Wedding of River Song')

&gt;then hand wave it all away.

when did they hand wave it away?

&gt;Amy and Rory act so devastated about Melody

this was a good part of the episode. amy and rory acted like real people. contradicting your last premise

&gt;then just don't give a shit in the next episode.

oh. now ""hand wave it all away"" makes sense. you aren't talking about A Good Man Goes to War. you are talking about ""Let's Kill Hitler"", which I have already conceded was not a good episode. so basically, your only actual complaint about ""A Good Man Goes to War"" is that you didn't like the clerics or the headless monks, and you didn't provide any reason for not liking them. wow.

&gt;Amy and Rory don't.

This is not a fair point to make. while ""Let's Kill Hitler"" was far from a perfect episode. I would love to hear how a 'real person' would act if her baby was stolen, then they grieved for months about it, then learned that their baby was their longtime friend who was a terrible person who then died right in front of them and turned into someone who was also their friend, but was a good person, but was still a bad person who then tried to kill their best friend. You would be just as confused as I was writing all that.

This all leads me to believe that just want to hate Moffat because he doesn't write transcendental two parters on aliens who fart and explode if you throw vinegar on them (aka, not silly) or feature the people of earth being united in one thought (that was totally not a prayer) that gave the doctor superpowers (aka, the people of earth didn't totally pray to give the doctor superpowers, and this totally wasn't silly). also, Davies never brought anything silly up, like a hospital manned by cat people. that was totally serious. also, having mannequinns come to life and try to kill people totally wasn't silly. also, having a monster that absorbed people whose only motivation was that he wanted to eat the doctor wasn't silly, nor was it randomly brought up. also talking rhinos? not silly, especially not compared to an army that is scared of the doctor and tries to kill him. also, that episode about the traffic jam. wtf, that traffic came out of nowhere, and was immediately handwaved away. also, that monster from midnight? how silly, and it was handwaved away, what a cop out, nobody acted like a real human being, real human beings wouldn't have freaked out like that. also, how silly was davros, I hated when he just got handwaved away. also, how silly was the time lords returning, I hated when they introduced that silly woman talking to wilf, who is also silly. it had good parts, like everyone turning into the master, but on the whole, it just followed the pattern of the RTD episodes, introduce something silly, then hand wave it all away. how nonsensical

obviously, at some point, I stopped being serious, and just started calling things silly to make my point. calling something silly isn't an argument. feel free to try again, making specific points about how the clerics and headless monks weren't good villains, or whatever your reason for not liking ""A Good Man Goes to War"" or any other one of the episodes I listed as being good episodes since Blink.",0,1350172710,null,0,false,0,c6m1xnc,t3_11eslw,t1_c6m1xnc,t1_c6m1584,null,1430140566,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

What would be interesting is if Suarez came out and said that he has dived in the past. He is not the only one, but the response from the FA and FIFA would then have to happen. Suarez coming out and saying, ""yes I have dived in the past, I won't deny that, but so do others, so why can't I"" (that is some poor wording and not the best way to say it but I think you get the idea). If he were to do this, then it would force others to come out and say it, then FIFA would have to react by trying to remove it from the game. Those that do not say that they have dived get shit thrown at them, FIFA put in some new rule to put an end to it, and then we go on our merry ways, where Suarez looks more like a hero then a villain. 

(Yes there is more to it, and yes I have only just thought of the idea and not done a huge amount of thinking, but my point still stands. Liverpool last year handled the racism situation poorly, if Suarez had said ""sorry, in my country that is not offensive and I apologize if it was taken the wrong way."" then it would have been dealt with and gone in a week or two, and Suarez would have been hit with probably a 2 match ban instead of an 8. This is more or less the same, take it on board, take the blow, and do it professionally, and you may come out on top.)",0,1350181952,null,0,false,0,c6m434p,t3_11f5mk,t1_c6m434p,t3_11f5mk,null,1430141580,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

When Amy asks the Doctor to go back and tell the younger her all these great stories, it doesn't make sense.

She was taken back to bed by the Doctor later that night in the series 5 finale.  Yes, she could've walked back outside and waited the next day, but older Amy doesn't bring up the fact he visited twice when she was 12.

If governments and charities were capable of fulfilling that role they would already have done so, because there's nothing to stop them developing drugs now. The truth is it's no more sensible to expect certified drugs to come exclusively out of thin air and altruism than it is for cars or mobile phones.

Or that we shouldn't spend public money on early stage research to catalyse the process.

But we'd need some basic sprites.  I think we can pull a few from the provided picture though.

I guess, one of the things we'd be missing though would be the ""Donkey Kong"" character (Davros... the creator of the Dalek race).  In this version the Daleks would be the barrels.

So, with programming languages, and frameworks and such.. I would humbly suggest we use jQuery for the JavaScript.  It's fast enough, and simple enough, and works well with HTML5.

Classic Doctor Who which is.. massive and cheesy and wonderfully dated... and New Who which is the new re-imagined version. You don't need to have been a fan on the classic to get into the new version, since they re-introduced everything when the new show aired. There are currently 7 seasons of New Who and numerous holiday specials that get lumped into seasons for the most part.

Try to start with the first season of New Who - I believe it started in 2005. The first few episodes are a bit cheesy, but it hits it's stride around Dalek and only improves from there. If you have the time, I highly recommend the show. Good luck :)

When he's dying at the end of *Let's Kill Hitler* he gets Mels to lean in close so he can whisper something to ""River"" (I'm calling her Mels for now becuase she hasn't taken on the mantle of River Song yet and doesn't even know who she is). The audience never hears what he says, but her response is ""I'm sure she knows.""

Now I think the assumption the audience is supposed to go with is that the Doctor tells Mels to tell River that he loves River. I think however that he tells Mels his name to tell to River. Mels' response still fits, and it fits in with everything else in the show. 

**The reasons it fits:**

In this episode, the Doctor firmly believes he's dying. The TARDIS has told him nothing, not even regeneration, is going to save him. The Doctor probably knew about Mels ability to save him, but couldn't ask her to sacrifice her remaining regenerations. He also knows that he has to tell River his name at some point so that she'll know it and can tell it to him while they're in the Library. As this is his last possible chance, he tells Mels his name. 

At the end of The Wedding of River Song she already knows his name so it's not too important that he instead tells her to look into his eyes. ",0,1350196551,null,0,false,0,c6m786o,t3_11fg2u,t1_c6m786o,t1_c6m5r8u,null,1430143125,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

&gt;**Positive action**

&gt;In specific circumstances, an employer may encourage or offer support specifically to men or women, and this 'positive action' is allowed under sex discrimination laws.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; It makes sense to have a cab service that only have women drivers.

Also discrimination.

The way I think of it is with race as an analogy. There are statistics that show more crime committed by people of certain races (especially in certain areas). But that doesn't mean it's OK to just assume the black guy must be guilty. Averaged out over all black people, sure, you'll probably find more crime (and more of the background reasons that push people into crime), but that's just averages - not particular individuals. You shouldn't punish one person because some *other* people that just happen to have the same skin colour have committed crimes.

Similarly, you shouldn't punish a male driver with higher insurance fees or exclusion from jobs just because *other* male drivers have had accidents.

As for leaving men stranded in the rain just because your company policy says you don't tolerate male customers? Perhaps justifying it because *other* men can look after themselves or whatever?

What if I started a cab company that treated women the same way? Fuck you, woman stuck in the middle of nowhere late on a cold, rainy miserable night, company policy is we only accept male customers - we're very sorry if you get raped or murdered, of course, but we're afraid we won't do anything to prevent it.

After all, *other* women have sometimes falsely accused men of rape or sexual assault, and our drivers are all male.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"&gt; Do you know what the monarchy contributes to the UK? Net they don't take anything, they generate a metric shitload of money.

Trash. They don't. Their businesses under perform, they squat on land, they don't pay proper taxation (no inheritance, income), they get CAP handouts, etc, etc. They are also privy to government policy and of course can direct government policy behind the scenes. That's as good as insider trading.

&gt; The monarch is given roughly 32 million each year by the government out of taxpayers money.

Wrong. This doesn't include security costs and one of special occasions.

&gt; Net the monarchy surrenders all profits from the rent of their land to the government voluntarily totaling 200 million pounds.

Include things like the Duchy of Cornwall and other areas of wealth. Let's also remember how they came to ""own"" such vast amounts: theft and violence. Let's also remember the origins of the national debt. If you believe it is as simple as 200 from the Crown estates, and 35-40 back in the other direction you are definitely seeing the whole picture. Something else is Charle's ""charity work"" where he has control over 100 million. I don't think much goes to feed and cloth starving orphans in Brixton or something like that. [It's a metric shitload of complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince%27s_Charities). His jam making endeavour is owned by a charity. His spending will align with his politics.

&gt; The jubilee and wedding? The largest tourist events after the Olympics we have.

International or domestic? For the queen will scramble fighter jets just for fun, and have goose stepping bear hats through the street, but for the under age sex worker in Rochdale, they just about have a proper investigation second or third time round. [It's too early to say whether the Olympics was good or bad yet](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/09/uk-tourist-attractions-plunge-visitor). I presume the temporary tax haven status didn't help the deficit.

&gt; People don't come for the nice weather and good food.

And neither do they come to shake hands with the queen. Monarchy is a tiny fraction of international traffic. Business and simply having friends or family in the UK dominate as motivation. There are governments stats to back this up.

As with you, there's no competition where I live. There's one cinema on the island, it's about £6.60 for tickets and as with most cinemas the food is expensive. *I don't mind paying that*, so long as it keeps our only cinema alive. I want to be able to see new releases, and I realise that cinemas have to charge a lot because the production company snaps up so much money. 

The cinema's screens are *tiny* in comparison to others - hopping on a boat to Jersey to go to the Cineworld there feels like a completely different and nicer experience. The popcorn is lush, chairs are big and the screens can show 3D. When I go to Bournemouth to see family there, we usually go to the ODEON.

It's something that will be job specific I guess. You'll find on graduating that employers will want industry recognised certificates along with your degree as further proof of your competency or relevent work experience.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I've never seen him play, but I'm rather encouraged by what I've read about him. He's meant to be a winger with genuine pace, trickery and knows where the back of the net is.

Last season he was Southend's top scorer with 14 goals and the top assist maker in the top four divisions with 25 assists in total. He also made 15 assists for Southend in the season before that. Warnock was also his manager at Crystal Palace, when he was younger. (I have read that Hall 'owes' Warnock for the work he did for him at Crystal Palace, but that came from an 'insider' so it's unclear whether or not there's any truth in that.)

However, he does appear to have some attitude problems. He was found guilty - and jailed for - affray outside a nightclub in Southend, although it's reported that it was after racist comments were made to him. He's also been training on his own and told that he's not wanted by Southend after the two bids from Peterborough and Blackpool were made for him, which caused him to fall out with Southend manager Paul Sturrock, who said that he wasn't ""mentally attuned"" to play due to the transfer speculation surrounding him.

I am feeling really positive about him being the kind of signing we need, though. He's a young, promising player who has been doing great in League 2 and clearly wants a move to a higher level of football. I'm sure that Warnock can handle him and he seems like a bargain, given his situation. Hopefully we can agree personal terms with him, which is something Blackpool weren't able to do with him (although I have heard that Oyston, the Chairman, has started being difficult with money around Holloway).",0,1350224094,null,0,false,0,c6ma1dc,t3_11f2jh,t1_c6ma1dc,t1_c6m8z5l,null,1430144455,2,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,2
true,evrae,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"&gt;A science programme on BBC's horizon had scientists on it, who do actually study science like the scientists in the LHC who said they cant be sure the universe isnt infinite.

People at the LHC probably aren't the best to ask about cosmology. The current consensus is that the universe is 'flat', and so overwhelmingly likely to be infinite in extent. While there could be closed flat geometries (such as the repeating box commonly used for simulations), they would imply that isotropy isn't true. There is no evidence this is the case.

&gt;Remember when it was on reddit and the news that the speed of light isnt the ultimate speed a particle with mass can travel at? Before the scientists realised the calculations were infact wrong?

Personally, I like what AVB is doing, I like him bringing in some of the youngsters, and to also acknowledge that his tactic isn't working (reading comes to mind) The only thing I don't like about AVB is when he pulls attackers and puts on defensive players to sit on a lead, when we being tottenham, don't seem to have much luck for holding onto clean sheets.

&gt;Property is theft.

Lets just get to grips with this. This is logically impossible. If all ownership is theft, everything would have to be depriving someone of something indefinitely (the definition of theft). If the notion of property was given up there was be no such thing as theft, you couldn't deprive someone of something they don't have rights to. The two concepts are dependent on each other to exist.

Why is intellectual property exist?

Because someone has rights over what they create, i mean if you disagree with this sentiment your disagreeing on the fundamental principle. If i write a song i have the rights to it, if i paint a painting i have the rights to sell it, or distribute it as i please, if i invent something, i have the rights to recreate it and sell it as i see fit.

So as well as higher prices on patented medicines, resulting profits will be taxed at a this much-reduced rate.

Firstly, who is the ""us""? Not UK citizens; I doubt he wants any more power to end up with us, so it must be the Tory Government. Which isn't really anything to do with us citizens (of whom only about 18% actually voted for the Tories at the last election); does it really affect us much as to whether we're run by a bunch of random aristocrats in Westminster, or a bunch of random aristocrats in Brussels/Strasbourg/Luxembourg?

Secondly, the UK Parliament already is sovereign. It's pretty much the fundamental constitutional principle of the UK. When the UK joined the EU (then the ... whatever it was) the Parliament voluntarily delegated some of its powers to the EU, in exchange for various rights and benefits. Obviously the UK Parliament can recover those powers any time it wants, but I imagine that might result in losing those rights and benefits.

It seems Gove wants the benefits of being in the EU (which are many) without having to agree to any of the conditions. Or, more likely, he wants to make a few headlines, win some support (both within and without his Party) so he can get more power and money.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"I would just like to address the ""Norway"" question - why do they have such a good relationship with europe if they arent part of the EU?

The answer is energy.

Norway has the good deals they do because they have the rest of europe over a barrel. They have the rest of europe fucking stitched up both ways due to energy tariffs.

What a lot of people dont realise is that as well as the huge amount of oil they produce, they are also the seventh in the world in producing renewable energy - mainly in the form of hydroelectric plants so 99% of energy produced in Norway is from hydroelectricity.

They then sell this energy under the Guarantee of Origin scheme for trading environmentally friendly electricity to the rest of the EU, allowing the EU to hit their Kyoto targets for reducing their energy produced by fossil fuels. In 2010 they exported just over half of their electricity generation to the EU.

At the same time, they sell most of the oil and gas that the EU uses, and reinvest that money in the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund - a pension scheme for the entire country. Its huge, owning 1% of all shares on the planet in 2009. That fund's mission is to smooth Norway's eventual exit from oil as production finally gives up the ghost in however many years time - so it invests in new, green technology like hydroelectric, wind and solar plants.

So lets recap: Norway produces a large amount of the natural gas and oil that is burnt by Europe for power, uses that money to invest in renewable energy via the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which is then sold back to Europe at a premium using the Guarantee of Origin scheme whose revenue is then re-invested in schemes for producing more renewable energy for export in the Guarantee of Origin scheme.

The EU depend on Norway not only for having easy access to oil, but also for easy access to renewable energy to escape punitive Kyoto fines. That is why they are doing so well, despite not being part of the EU.",0,1350233028,null,0,false,0,c6mbpac,t3_11gdxe,t1_c6mbpac,t3_11gdxe,null,1430145234,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

This is why I was asking, sometimes I think we hold back because of headlines.

Plus Iraq and Afghanistan are certainly not a defensive conflict IMO.

Soon we'll be able to have a little drone on every street corner, each unit will fly back to its charging station when it needs more power and while its charging, another will take its place.  These drones will soon have weapons attached so we can replace a body on the ground with a cheap, disposable flying unit soon.

We're not quite there yet, but there's plenty of people working on weaponising automatic / controlled units at the moment.  Boston Dynamics being a perfect example.

I can't help but feel ground troops are obsolete.  If push came to shove and we had another ""world war"" with a genuine threat.  Maybe not now, but in a couple of years.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Well your clearly insane

Ad hominem to start - great, but, you want to debate me on property, so excellent.  I'm guessing from a position of total philosophical ignorance or you wouldn't have made the incredibly stupid and unsophisticated argument that Proudhon's assertion that ""property is theft"" is:

&gt;logically impossible

So.  What's your argument?

&gt; If all ownership is theft, everything would have to be depriving someone of something indefinitely (the definition of theft). If the notion of property was given up there was be no such thing as theft, you couldn't deprive someone of something they don't have rights to. The two concepts are dependent on each other to exist.

OK.  Firstly, you immediately set about redefining ""property"" as ""ownership"".  

Secondly, you couch theft in terms of currently existing English law. The book introducing the phrase you want to critique is French, and the subject is political philosophy rather than jurisprudence.  You can't just go around assuming the modern capitalist English law definition of theft is good for now and for all time across the world.

Thirdly.  If I say A is B, unless you assume an identity between the two, it doesn't follow that without A there can be no B.  A could easily be a subset of B.  Property is theft, in the work concerned, means private property is theft, possession or personal property is considered legitimate (in fact, in the same work it is called freedom).  But yes, if you eliminate private property, you eliminate the vast majority of theft.  Private property has historically almost exclusively been acquired by theft, and it provides the principle motive for theft in return, so if you eliminate private property, you can expect to see theft plummet.  Not sure how this remotely undermines the argument, in fact it barely touches upon it.

&gt;Why (does) intellectual property exist?

&gt;Because someone has rights over what they create

Of course, everyone has the rights to their own labour.  But what they don't have a right to is a government guaranteed monopoly.  If I make something I can keep it or sell it, but on what basis can I expect the government to enforce my keeping it and yet selling it ad nauseum?

&gt; Its simple, someone reaps what they sow (individual and corporate).

Would that that were the case, Western law is largely a system to ensure the corporate board and the capitalist shareholder reaps what the worker sows.  I'm 100% in favour of people being paid in full for their labour (and only their labour).  That's called socialism.

&gt;This philosophy is the very foundation of the western world. It dates back to Greek and roman founders. Its one of the basics of society. 

You'd be surprised.  Things have changed radically since Greece and Rome - and not always for the better, though we've done away with a lot of slavery.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;This brings me to the next attitude that I found slightly odd (if not disturbing): that somehow science can settle this debate with figures about viability.
If I remember correctly, Caroline Flynt was involved in a long debate about Jeremy Hunt's view not being supported by 'the evidence'. Well, for the reasons above -- that the point of personhood seems to be necessarily a moral issue. So your opinion can be informed by the evidence but it cannot be proven or disproven. As far as I know, Jeremy Hunt never justified his opinion by saying ""Well, the science shows that pregnancies are viable at 12 weeks so clearly the limit should be then..."". The panel seemed to miss the point that he disagreed with viability as the 

12 weeks is the time the foetus is fully formed within the uterus, i.e all the limbs are developed, all the organs are developed, everything is is place. The 'blueprint' is in place as it were.  The next 28 weeks are spent growing, developing those limbs and organs and putting on weight ready for birth. A foetus is certainly not 'viable' at that age, i.e ready for survival outside the uterus. 

There is a 'grey' area between 21 and 24 weeks were a baby may or may not be considered viable depending on the condition of the baby at birth, a decision is made at the time by the doctors and it dependant on a number of factors. If it is considered to be viable, then they will attempt to support the life of that baby, but it is by no means certain. 

After 24 weeks the baby is more likely to be viable, again dependant on a number of factors but obviously the longer the gestation the better the chances. 

IMO science should be used to settle disagreements about viability, because science is fact and does not include emotion or moral judgement, that is something quite different. 

I didn't see the programme ( QT irritates me for the reasons you have mentioned above) but if they panel have failed to distinguish the above, either on the QT or in their own minds then they have no place having the debate whether they are ill informed.

Because that is a vital role, and they have demonstrated their capability at fulfilling it.

Strawman, and I don't believe it is up to ""her majesty's"" army to open up trade routes. If I was Argentinian I'd probably want to boycott the UK.

&gt; And was the speech where Ahmajinedad called for the destruction of Israel just a cleverly edited video?

It's interesting because [""Ahmadinejad himself has repeatedly said that his remark was misinterpreted. Dan Meridor, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, has also stated that it was not what Ahmadinejad said.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel). It's also ironic because Israel is helping wipe out the Palestinians and are very keen to take Lebanon (hence the clandestine activity in Syria). The Gaza flotilla was an interesting event. I don't have to rely on bastardised and sensationalised quotes to create a picture of a violent Israel. But if I wanted, I can find some quotes from lobbyists and other similar types tied to Israeli. What sticks out the most is this gem from Fox favourite Pam Geller because it actually mentioned nuking Europe out of spite:

&gt; [And I pray dearly that in the ungodly event that Tehran or its jihadi proxies (Hez'ballah, Hamas etc) target Israel with a nuke, that she retaliate with everything she has at Tehran, Mecca, and Medina... Not to mention Europe. They  exterminated all their Jews, but that wasn't enough. Those monsters then went on to import the next generation of Jew killers]

It has everything to do with trade. Historically and currently, the largest nations have been the most beneficial with trade. You said it yourself about the US- a world leading power. Just look at China, Brazil, India. Developing nations vast in size that are actually seeing growth. They have the resources, the potential. And for starters, their economies are not failing. 

Underestimating nor not. We're not better in the situation we are now. Of course the EU is holding us back. Some representative from Brussels tells us what we can and can't do with are trade, we have restrictions here and there, we're getting pulled into this mess. 

You seem to forget the United States only climbed itself out of the depression because of their entry into the war. Which seen the enormous boost of manufacturing and job creation. It was the catalyst, the spark which boosted things to their pre-war state again. Now unless we have something like that happening now, as it stands the EU, and the Euro project is finished. There's no point hanging on to this ""Euro dream"". Something which Angela Merkel herself described it as. 

They're not concerned about the mass unemployment rates, they're not concerned about people in Greece starving, and struggling to feed their families. As long as their ""great"" project is alive, and those unelected bureaucrats still stay in the positions of power they have, then that's all what matters.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"I'm not sure really. Firstly, I think it is a bit of a myth that we need the ""private"" sector for innovation especially when the ""state"" (and workers) provide the infrastructure like education and other more direct investments. Dogbotherer's link I believe mirrors my own thoughts. Secondly, the health of the west is dreadful so there is something wrong somewhere, and the massive investment into new drug X creates scenarios of big-pharma too big to fail. Corruption and faux-innovation are incentivised.

I'm still quite sure resource allocation would occur to address medical concerns because that is just how human interest and curiosity work. Intellectual property isn't necessary except if you want a particular business model. Also look at the protectionism, paywalls and adversarial behaviour that just surrounds research publication. For all we know cannabis or some other weed might be something special but monopoly status just couldn't be enforced. Take money off the table and I'm quite sure people would coordinate to solve whatever problem is at hand; we've done so for a few tens of thousands of years.

You are also speculating that if it is the case that the ""private sector"" was impossible without intellectual property, then firstly no private endeavour could succeed, but secondly ""the state"" would have to step in. Neither of those follow from the first premise. Something not too disimilar than present but without all these ""market distortions"" doesn't seem an outrageous idea.

Mordred's change of heart may or may not be genuine. The Key mentioned that Arthur was his own bane, but that might just refer to his decision to knight Mordred. Plus, Morgana lived, so it's quite possible Mordred is just setting up a future plot by gaining Arthur's trust. ...Also, what's the deal with him getting knighted, while Merlin's still pretty much treated like crap?

I liked that Guinevere turned out to be cleverer than she looked as far as sentencing Sefa to death. However, it'd be nice if her plot had actually worked, instead of all Camelot's guards being incompetent. ...Though I guess that's more due to Ruadan having magic, but shouldn't they have already known that? Anyway, still, Sefa should realize that treason and not wanting anyone to get hurt are kind of opposite goals. Wonder what'll come of her...

Guess we'll see the repercussions next week.

* Azad Ali used to attend talks by the spiritual leader of Al Qaeda in Europe: Abu Qatada.
* Azad Ali wants Ismail Haniyeh – leader of the genocidal antisemitic terrorist organisation, Hamas – to be the Caliph of the next Caliphate.
* Azad Ali admired the Al Qaeda and recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki and had this to say about him on the Islamic Forum of Europe’s blog: “I really do love him for the sake of Allah, he has an uncanny way of explaining things to people which is endearing.”
* Azad Ali’s show on the Islam Channel was sanctioned by OFCOM for its failure to maintain due impartiality in its coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict, including in relation to comments on Mahmoud Abbas. That’s because he’s a Hamas supporter.
* When an undercover reporter for Dispatches exposed Azad Ali’s political views, he threatened them on his radio show, saying: “We’ve got a picture of you and a lot more than you thought we had.

Do the grey tone with the vine charcoal like you already do and don't be afraid to over do it. Once you have it laid down, take a tissue paper and really even it out. Smooth the color so it's one consistency and looks nice and creamy.

Once that's done, map out the subject and the shadows and lay those in dark. 

This is the most important tip of them all: DONT USE WHITE CHARCOAL PENCIL OR WHITE CHARCOAL UNTIL THE VERY END. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but when it mixes with the black it creates this wibbly wobbly consistency that just doesn't flow right.

If you look in the cheekish area, it just doesn't go with the drawing at all. Rather than using the white, just erase some of the smooth neutral grey you made with the vine.

Azpi-----Luiz-----Cahill-------Cole

--------Oscar------Mikel--------

---KdB--------Mata---------Hazard

-----------Torres/Lukaku--------------

I think in maybe 2-3 years time this would be the line-up we try to use. Oscar is great at keeping the ball at his feet and getting out of sticky situations with the ball at his feet. As you said, Oscar has good defensive abilities so we would not exposed by our opponents midfielders. 

I think the most important part is his ability to link play between our CM's and the attack, which he is doing now. He has a good idea of where the defense is and where his best position is based on that. 

In short, I believe Oscar would be the perfect player to play as a deep-lying playmaker, just not yet.

Which is one of the many reasons why we need to stop the hero worship of militants and prevent wars of aggression. The crimes of soldiers shouldn't be made a special case, and if anything there is a case be made for them being treated with a greater severity.

true,Rynoh,null,null,"Like German I don't think this is necessarily a position we need to address at this point.  Against weaker teams I feel it is possible to drop Oscar into the pivot with Mikel or Lampard to get Moses or Marin into the fold.  Against the top teams I feel that it is important to have a capable defender playing in the middle of the band of 3.  Oscar's defensive work on Pirlo and against Arsenal show his value in this position.  He is currently the only player we have capable of putting in that type of quality defending from an offensive position.

The role of the pivot is to shield the defense and transition from defense to attack.  Ramires gives us much more in transition defending then any other pivot  option we have.  The job of transitioning from defense to attack can be done several different ways.  Players like Modric take control wait for players to break forward and make the pass to initiate the attack.  Ramires on the other hand, wins the ball and takes off with it.  It has been interesting watching him win the ball deep in Chelsea territory and then make a driving run with the ball at his feet to quickly transition from attack to defense.  While it is true that he's not the best passer (especially in some of the in close passes) he is good at makingi easy passes and exploding into dangerous positions to receive another pass on the break.  Combinining his ability to break forward with Oscar's tendency to come back to the ball is an intriguing option.  It gives us a better defensive setup, allows Oscar to come back and make himself aviable, make late runs into the box, and to control the flow of the attack when a team packs it in.  It allows Ramires an easy outlet to dump the ball off to while exploding into the attack.  

Essentially Oscar drops back to be our deep lying playmaker in transition while Ramires is allowed to make his driving runs, once the initial attack breaks down Oscar is in position to recycle possession and start new attacks while Ramires drops back to his defensive cover.  

Needless to say I really like the way this is starting to play out.",0,1350261347,null,0,false,0,c6mio0d,t3_11hadp,t1_c6mio0d,t3_11hadp,null,1430148601,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,ermahgerditsAMY,tennant,Tennant,"""Tolerated""?! Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. This is a comedy/sci-fi/time-travel/drama/romance about a man, who's actually of an alien race called the Time Lords, called the Doctor. He travels through space and time saving entire worlds and universes using (usually) nothing but his wit and non-lethal weapon: a sonic screwdriver.

He usually has human (or robot, or alien) companions traveling around with him in his TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space [his time machine]). Every few years (seasons) or so, he regenerates--remember, he's not human--and a new actor takes his place as the Doctor. New face, same character.

It has been on since the 1960's, so there have been eleven men to play the Doctor. If you're going to watch it, I recommend starting from 2005 Series 1, the first episode being ""Rose."" This is the beginning of the reboot after over a decade of the show being off the air, so they start somewhat fresh and assume the viewer knows nothing about the show.

true,ben9345,english,London,"Killing enemy combatants is not murder. That's not something unique to Britain its universal. If killing in war was murder then no-one wold be able to defend themselves against countries who don't consider it murder. If on D-Day someone pointed out that killing in war is murder and they called it off and the entire European continent was now a jew-free, fascist paradise would that have been a good idea? Not really would it. We can't and won't change the rule based on what wars you think should and should not be fought. Therefore all countries recognise crimes in active war differently. Clearly the victims could not be classified as combatants maybe because they were prisoners and therefore the soldiers are being prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I don't see anyone jumping to conclusions in here. In fact most people are holding off from saying anything until we know what they did. 

Also on your last point your simply wrong. There is no precedent for war crimes prosecutions being in the country where they were committed. Charles Taylor was tried in the Netherlands, Saddam Hussein in America and the Nuremberg Trial which were carried out before there was any structure to war crimes prosecutions were still carried out by British, American, Soviet and French judges. Its literally never been the case that war crimes are prosecuted by the victim country...ever.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think we could move Oscar back to a deep lying playmaker and it would work fairly well BUT we lose a lot from him if we do so. I've been really liking Oscar as a CAM. Aside from his creative talent and eye for goal his pressing has been doing so much for us. He neutralized Pirlo and Arteta pretty damn well. In recent games we have also started to win the ball higher up the pitch more often thanks to Oscar and Torres pressing in tandem. It works really well for Torres and really well for our offensive players in general when we are able to win the ball in the opposition half and attack quickly before they can get organized. 

In response to the second point, yes, I think we do want a deep-lying playmaker. It shouldn't be urgent but eventually we at least want the option. There will be times where it is advantageous. With the talent we have I see no need to drop Oscar back to do so. Keep him terrorizing defenses with his dazzling link-up play and tenacious pressing. KDB and McEachran are both suited to playing as a deep-lying playmaker and IMO we should just keep the competition between these two, especially considering that we will probably only opt for a deep playmaker on certain occasions. One thing you will notice about KDB is his very direct style, great long range passing, and excellent long distance shooting all in addition to a good tactical brain. For anyone who hasn't, try to catch a Werder game sometime, his CM play is surprisingly good. I think most of us here are pretty familiar with McEachran and he would be great for the role as well.

You realise your trying to compare UK gun law to American gun laws and it's silly to do so right?  You need exactly two pieces of legal paperwork to drive a Challenger Main Battle Tank on the road.  1) A valid UK or European driving license 2) A shotgun license to cover the 120mm cannon.

So no, you aren't American.  American's in the know are in awe of our gun legislation; something about ours being bigger than theirs.  And yes I've seen a civilian tank with L-plates going down the street before now so this isn't theoretical.

""She feels being a mum will be easier than finding a job and is the only way she’ll secure a council-funded home.""

""Five of my friends got pregnant to get a house last year and they’re 15 and 16 – it’s the only way to get anywhere"" - Will you be asking her for videos as well?

&gt;RE The second one - ""Nothing there at all to support your argument"":

""I was that girl who thought having a baby would give me a family unit and a house and a life.""

&gt;RE: Daily Mail - ""I was expecting something in the article to support your argument but there is nothing there, which was a surprise.""

If claiming that having unprotected sex at the age of 12 was ""the smartest thing I ever did"" doesn't classify it as deliberate then I doubt nothing will.

&gt;RE: Telegraph - ""Again nothing to support your argument.""

Pregnant twice by the age of 15. You can argue that once could be a mistake, but there's definitely an ulterior motive with it happening twice.

Nowhere of course. It is irritating to see people protesting against a fundamental foundation of one's modern civilisation though. It's not like they're having a shouty shout about whether salt and vinegar should come in blue packs again, or that their group of 10 guys who kick a ball are better than yours, they're actually protesting against freedom.

&gt;Personally I strongly disagree with them in this case

As do I.

&gt;but if they protest non violently (and it seems this is what they were doing)

Indeed so, well within their rights. I'm not having a go at them protesting, but rather what they believe. I've got no problem with anyone protesting peacefully.

&gt;I see no reason not to discuss this with them.

Herein lies the problem. Is there any point to discussion with someone who says they love an imaginary man more than their own lives? They are not reasonable people, they are not rational people. This entire affair the world over has been an emotional uprising orchestrated by wiser men playing politics and manned by less wise men whose emotions are manipulated any time you drop a few allahu akbar.

I don't know what can be done to improve the sorts of attitudes these dudes have, but ultimately I'm not sure I care for the idea that we need to.

true,naturenet,eng-wight,Isle of Wight,"This is a really interesting question. I'd love to know if anyone has researched this (I didn't turn up anything usable on Google). 

So I fall back on anecdote. I'm in my mid-40s and have lived most of my life in rural areas where most people are white British by origin, and there are lots of retired people. So that's what my experience is drawn from. 

It once seemed to me as though older people were more racist, and I imagined that as they died, their ideas would die out with them. But with experience I'm not sure that is true. Here is why. What is true is that in the past it was common to express yourself in ways which today we would certainly call racist. Use of offensive words in common speech is one easy demonstration of this. When I was a child in the 1970s it was very common to hear people talking about 'n*****s'. Some used the word, as now, as a racist insult. But others, particularly older people, used it simply as a descriptive word, perhaps unconscious of the implications - this would be impossible today. Similarly, the way famine and poverty in, say, Africa or Bangladesh was presented in the 1970s was heavily influenced by colonialism and a paternalistic outlook - the ""white man's burden"" was a concept that still made sense to people who could remember the Empire. Today the way such matters are discussed is very different. But it remains the case that older people will express themselves in ways which might seem racist to younger people, even if their underlying views are not that different.

My perception that older people are more racist hasn't turned out to be true. I now live in a seaside town where foreign students are common visitors and shamefully, every summer there are racist incidents where the perpetrators turn out to be young locals. Of the people I know, I cannot say that racist attitudes have any age-related bias. 

**TL;DR** It seems to me that racist ideas and behaviour can occur in anyone of any age; even if older people are perhaps bolder and less inhibited about demonstrating it. ",0,1350286773,null,0,false,0,c6mo49r,t3_11hx86,t1_c6mo49r,t3_11hx86,null,1430151226,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

- Radio 1: Music, for the ""yoof"". Aims at an audience from teenagers to mid/late-20s. Covers most mainstream music genres, as well as some from a little outside the charts on specialist shows.

- Radio 2: Music, for adults. Once you start finding Radio 1 a little too noisy, Radio 2 is probably more your tastes. The presenters are a little older, and the music is less _challenging_, for want of a better word. They play new music, but it's the kind you find mums buying. Throw in a few tunes from the last couple of decades (not really golden oldies, but not in the charts right now) and this is Radio 2.

- Radio 3: Classical music, orchestras and so on. Can't say I've listened to it, so there might be something a little wider in scope.

- Radio 4: Talk radio. Dramas, plays, comedy, documentaries, that kind of thing. Not much in the way of phone-ins or anything. Usually programmes made for radio specifically, including some long-running series.

- Radio 5: Talk radio. Mostly sports commentary and news. When there's no live sport, it tends to be discussion programmes, interviews with guests and phone-ins. When there's sport, there will be live radio commentary of matches, with a concentration on football.

There are a few older people who have very negative views, particularly those who lost relatives, or had or witnessed other unpleasant experiences/events.  Secondly, of course, they ""won"", and they've had two other wars since which they also won (Cambodia, China) - that makes a difference.  It's easier to be magnanimous in victory, even a relatively pyrrhic one.

But, and this links to the above, that does mean they have a very proud, nationalistic and martial disposition, which (and I say this as someone with a deep affection for the place and its people) can manifest as insufferable arrogance on occasion.

Add to that a country which is relatively ethnically homogeneous, with clear limits on minority and foreigners' rights, and you're always going to feel a bit of an outsider.

When I arrived at Wembley on my way to the pub and a (clearly intoxicated) group of men, around 50 years old came up to me. One put his arm around me, ""Do you like p***s?"" he said to me. ""Look at this place, fucking full of them!"". I was slightly startled by this. Admittedly, there is a large Asian population in Wembley,  but after informing him I had no problem with it, he marked me as a ""traitor"" and walked off up the road singing ""England till I die"".

When in the pub, I noticed that those in their 20's (like myself) were drinking and having a laugh with those of different races (Who were all there supporting England, wearing the shirts.) Down the bottom end of the pub, were a group of men, again maybe in their late 40's / 50's. They were all singing songs with racist connotations. 

Now i'm not saying all middle aged people are racists, indeed, I have met many (the large majority) of  older people who are very accepting and kind, and on the flip side younger people who are what I can only describe as evil bigots. But it makes you think where they got this ideology from. Who's to blame? the parents? right-wing newspapers? the substantial increase of multiculturalism under the previous Labour government?

true,dominicshaw,uk,London,"We're devaluing our currency mostly through inflation. You may have heard of the mostly american phrase - quantitative easing - basically injecting a load of printed money into the economy. They have a whole raft of ways of injecting cash, and therefore de-valuing the existing cash. I'm no expert so it's hard for me to articulate as well as I'd like.

The affect of this is that, as B4mf0rth said, other currencies are worth more in comparison to the pound, and therefore buying from the UK is a cheaper option. Same as when you go abroad - many people from the UK used to go to Greece when it was Drakma (sp?), but when it went Euro, it became a lot more expensive and tourism dropped. Same with Spain and many others. Now, a lot of Brit's go to Turkey because it has a ""weaker"" currency - the same thing applies - people would rather buy the same product at the same standard from Turkey, than from Britain. Luckily for us we are world leaders in some niche industries so we can demand a good price regardless of the currency in certain areas (sound systems, arms, etc). But for most exporters, a weaker pound means more international orders. I wouldn't say its ALL about the USD, but they are the biggest spenders, so they are the most important single concern.

Growth, yes, economic growth. We put great stock on economic growth in the UK. In my opinion it would be better to concentrate on working within our budget than to try to enlarge the budget, but what do I know! They can do both, I just think their priorities are a bit messed up.

I find it hard to separate the BS when it comes to the NHS - the news reports all sorts of things and honestly I don't know who is telling the truth - nor have I had the impetus to go and find out. It's hard to escape the reality that the NHS is hugely expensive and there is a lot of waste. I think that nurses (like teachers and many other key workers) are woefully underpaid and the victim of cost cutting in the wrong places. I don't understand what is going on with the ""privatisation of the NHS"" but I wish I did. I can't imagine how hard it must be to run an organisation like the NHS - I am very grateful it is not my job. If we are privatising it, I think that is awful. It's hard not to look at the trains and see how bad privatisation can be when it is not done very well (like phones/internet/etc?).

Right now it seems to me the most important thing to consider is our financial policy, which is why, right now, I think our Government is the right choice. They aren't perfect - and I have never voted Tory before, but Labours growth-centric policies would be, in my opinion, a disaster. 

I know almost no one agrees with me, but I think it's a shame that this coalition will almost certainly never happen again, because I think that the conservatives tempered by the lib dems have come up with some sensible policies while protecting economy and not destroying liberalism in one of the most difficult times for many decades. 

There are key policies which I think are very important - the tax rate is one of them - upping the lower limit (so you dont pay tax on the first 10k or so you earn) and lowering the upper limit (you pay 40% on 35k+) was a painful thing for many of us, but absolutely fair and had to be done, and done gradually, many people hardly noticed. Pay freezes are another - although I don't think underpaid workers like teachers and nurses should have been included (I'm neither, by the way) - it's absolutely necessary to bring our standard of living down, and that is how to do it. 

Maintaining a benefit system that will support people when they need it but not allow people to take advantage is hugely important and this is a failing of the conservatives. I think sometimes they do things because they want to score points, not because it is financially worthwhile. There will always be benefit cheats and that is awful and should be prevented, but there is a balance between stopping cheating and hurting people who genuinely need them - it has got to be better to have a few cheats than for people who need it to go wanting. 

There are lots of answers to lots of questions - sorry for the wall. This is all opinion - as other users said, the Guardian and Economist are good sources. Avoid Murdoch and do background reading to stories you think are interesting.
