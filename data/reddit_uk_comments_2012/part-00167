I have, over the last decade, become completely disenchanted with democracy and government. All the major political parties are more or less indistinguishable from each other. The Labour-dem-servatives will claim to support whatever policy their focus groups tell them is the most popular one, in order to grab a term in power. All politicians, regardless of claimed affiliation, are spineless crooks and career lie-dispensers, and I don't trust any of them.

As such I have completely lost any sort of respect for police, council and governmental legislation and authority. I see every law passed to be a violation of my rights as an individual, and I see taxation as theft. Government to me is a hostile entity, determined to curtail my freedoms and dictate to me what I can do on my own land.

Simply put, I have no faith in democracy, and want nothing to do with government.

EDIT: To clarify my positions on the other parties,

Conservatives: Don't agree with the current government's idea of austerity, and am generally far too much of a raging leftie.

UKIP: I think we're far better off in Europe, influencing things, than out of Europe and forced to accept whatever they do. Like it or not, Europe is our biggest trading partner and would continue to have an enormous influence on us even if we left.

BNP: I'd like to think I'm not a racist.

Liberal Democrats: Used to be a fan, but I really don't like the recent Orange Book trend towards Free Market, and their part in the Coalition has been an absolute disaster. If someone like Cable took over and there was a shift back towards the more social democratic end of the spectrum, I'd consider them again.

Greens: Generally good and I'd love to vote for them, but there's an anti-science underbelly them, not to mention some rather incompetent leadership. Plus, they don't run any candidates anywhere near me I believe.

Plaid Cymru (I live in Wales): Another party I'd generally support, but I can't get behind the whole Welsh nationalism stick. An independent Wales (I know they don't advocate independence as strongly as the SNP) would be an absolute disaster.

So that leaves me with Labour: I'm not a fan of New Labour in the slightest, and while I actually quite like Miliband, a lot of the current Shadow Cabinet are people I wouldn't really like in government, especially Balls. So while I don't particularly like Labour, I don't hate them or disagree with their fundamental ideals or anything, so they win by default.

If a decent independent ever ran in my seat I'd probably vote for them. But unfortunately I'm in a Labour safe seat (South Wales valleys ftw), so that's unlikely to happen.",0,1354031677,null,0,1354039591,0,c77joyh,t3_13vgzm,t1_c77joyh,t3_13vgzm,null,1430513622,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Davison and McCoy would certainly do it, assuming no other complications.  So would McGann, though I understand he'd want to have a new look--he's pictured on some CD covers dressed fairly similarly to Eccleston's doctor.

I am not a member of the LGBT society but I feel that Usamah's presence is a worry to more than those who identify as LGBT. As a woman and an open minded human being I will be attending the protest. People of all sexualities, races, classes and religions are expected to attend. Many Muslim students feel Usamah's presence is unwarrented. 

While it has been stated that this is not a protest against the Islamic Society but Usamah himself I cannot deny my disappointment that the heads of the Islamic Society would bring such hate to Brunel and that the NUS President would allow his presence. 

We have been criticised for protesting as apparently we are creating isolation for the Islamic Society but in my mind they did not think about the feelings of others when inviting him. 

There was an open meeting this afternoon where members of the Islamic Society defended their decision to invite him to speak. It was said that his words about women, Jews, Christians and Homosexuals were taken out of context but I don't see how saying we should ""throw homosexuals off a mountain"" could be taken out of context. It has also been pointed out that he is only here to speak on Aisha the wife of Muhammed but that topic brings with it it's own controversy in my opinion, after all she was a woman and a child bride. And even so, it wouldn't be acceptable for any society to invite Nick Griffin to speak about anything, even flower arranging. 


This is free speech pushed past the limits of what should be acceptable. This man is evil regardless of race or religion.

Yes, their position in the graphical ""before match"" pitch on television shows them as a defender, but they are much more offensive in their real role. Riise was OK defensively -- He was IMMENSE offensively, in 2005. He didn't manage to keep his form up in later years, but that is another discussion. :) Aurelio was also very good, but in his prime he did not match Riise in his best year, at least not in my book.

How so?

&gt; Under the new system, you actually pay less back per year if you earn under £50k anyway

This statement, and

&gt; At least higher fees make you think twice about whether you really need that liberal arts degree.

are contradictory. If higher fees are better for people with worthless degrees, more people are going to get the 'liberal arts' degrees that you are implying are somehow worth less than others.  
So you're either wrong about people being better off, or you're supporting a system which will induce people to act in the opposite way you want. 

&gt; Personally, I believe that degrees should be subsidized based on subject, pick the degrees which we are short of graduates from and almost fully fund them, whilst withdrawing a lot of funding for some others that won't even repay their loans on average.

The government does do this. Physiotherapy for example is fully funded by the government. What is the result of this? Loads of physiotherapists who don't have jobs, and therefore 'won't even repay their loans on average'. So using your system, we'll have waves of a surplus of workers, followed shortly by a deficit, etc. which will be terrible for the labour market in general.

So they made that stupid pledge about tuition fees (which Danny Alexander was against precisely because it was untenable) because ""what the hell, it will be popular but we'll never have to go through with it"", only to end up in a position where they were actually in office making decisions. And this fucked them.

It's also worth noting that regardless of who is currently the administration, the government itself is much larger than politicians. The majority of the British government is made up of civil servants, quite a few with permanent jobs. And they will have a huge influence on what the actions of the government will be, because they regulate and filter politics to protect the process of government from people they consider to be well meaning amateurs who come and go far to frequently to be trusted. 

So the tl:dr of this is that one should never take the promises or stances of a party current in opposition as truthful, because they are held purely for their PR value and not because they are actually feasible or workable. And this is why despite all the objections Labour have with the current administrations policies very little will actually change should they be elected.

Loads of people said that they lived at their grandparents or that they lived with their mum (in their second home) who doesn't work (because their dad earned six figures) or stuff like that. It was really easy to abuse. The kids who tended to get EMA at my school were those who needed it and then the richest ones.

&gt; are contradictory. If higher fees are better for people with worthless degrees, more people are going to get the 'liberal arts' degrees that you are implying are somehow worth less than others.

Pay less back per year, but pay it off for longer. It helps you when you graduate but if you earn over the threshold but not by much you'll pay it back for longer.

I'll more than imply that they're worth less, I'll say it outright. They don't improve your job prospects if you look at the opportunity cost of working for three years instead of studying.

&gt; The government does do this. Physiotherapy for example is fully funded by the government. What is the result of this? Loads of physiotherapists who don't have jobs, and therefore 'won't even repay their loans on average'. So using your system, we'll have waves of a surplus of workers, followed shortly by a deficit, etc. which will be terrible for the labour market in general.

I said degrees that we *need*. Every year they'd just have to look at where there are shortages, not just the NHS like midwives and OTs but in the private sector, chemistry for example.

Because doctors are seen as an of authority often when people are in desperate need of reassurance they always have to sound like they know what they're talking about. Even when they're not sure they'd rather label you as having mental problems than admit their observations and tests could be lacking. It's fundamentally an ego problem. 

Also more and more I see doctors simply referring you to have tests rather than relying on the years of built up experience they should have.

We're losing more and more of our civil liberties. The Tories and the Lib Dems are planning to bring in legislation to record which websites we visit, who we e-mail and the subject lines of those mails, who we send IMs to etc. This is a recycling of Labour's Interception Modernisation Programme and it'll cost two billion pounds. I can think of a lot of better ways to spend that money. Not to mention the stupid number of CCTV cameras we have in this country. Covert surveillance should **only** happen with a warrant issued by a court.

 Internet censorship &amp; disconnection and the reversal of the burden of proof (guilty until you pay to prove your innocence) are abhorrent.

Truly public space has disappeared, far too often the spaces we use are privately owned and we have no real right to make use of them. The Pirate's policy of pseudo-public spaces is a brilliant one.

We need to both promote science and use evidence in policy-making. All too often evidence is chucked out of the window and ideology is the only thing driving government policy. Science funding is abysmal and needs to be improved.

Policies like a 'set up your own business' experience to complement work experience and entrepreneurial training will be essential going forward.

Drug patents need to be abolished. The vast majority of pharmaceuticals are paid for by the public sector, so why should this money be syphoned off as profits? Only 15% of pharma revenue is spent on R&amp;D, and generic drugs are 70% cheaper than patented ones. We can **increase** R&amp;D spending whilst **reducing** the overall drug spend by funding pharma R&amp;D directly.

Drug abuse should be seen as a health issue, not as a criminal issues. The big 3 all want to be seen to be ""tough on drugs"" rather than solve the issue of addiction and abuse. At all times, the scientific evidence should be used as the basis for decision making rather than ideology.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Firstly, its entirely possible that depression/stress was a totally correct secondary diagnosis.

Yeah it might have been but it might have been the product of a genuine physical issue they missed which is the key point. 

&gt;Secondly, we still don't know what he died of. He may have suffered an embolism on the spot that was nothing to do with his 5 visits.

Possible but it seems pretty unlikely considering the same issue (collapsing) was causing him to go to hospital each time and what happened before he finally died. 

&gt;Your reply is a damned if they do, damned if they don't. Surely if one doesn't know what is wrong with someone then sending them for tests to see what one had missed would be the correct response?

I'm saying often it seems the very first think they do is tests and rely on them solely, discounting a patients personal experience which could be informative.  

&gt;Sounding reassuring helps to cure people. Using the placebo effect in the patients favour is very important.

Sounding reassuring and appearing as though you're right when you're not isn't always productive. Having so much certainty in your own ability or making a patient believe that can have dire consequences when they take your advice and it's wrong. Sometimes it's better to admit you may be wrong so they'll try other avenues to help them self. 

&gt;Working on instinct leads to shitty science

Not working on instinct alone but taking it into account.

true,etherealcheese,null,null,"If I understand you correctly, your previous post was not really about 'gay parents are more likely to make kids gay', but that sexuality should not be condensed into simple gay/straight labels and should be recognised in degrees.  
I think the problem with your interpretation of the kinsey scale is not your thoughtfully open understanding of it, but everyone else's confusion and misuse.  
Take a straight father, he's unlikely to mention that he has a bit of a crush on that guy at work with that really tight, little arse, all smooth and taut and...  Lost my train of thought.  He will however be likely to  have stern words for his son if he discovers he has a similar attraction; the son could be 90% straight but any homosexual longing is viewed as undesirable and must be purged.  The son could prefer women on a usual basis but finds real love and attraction to a man, and social pressure shuts it down.  He's less likely to identify as non-straight because of his parent's attitudes, and abandons that relationship for a 'normal one'.  
I can understand something like that, gay parents wouldn't have gave a crap and the son could be happy with whomever he likes.  
But the other side of that is the mother who might constantly remind her 90% gay daughter, who's been in a civil partnership for five years, about that one boyfriend she had when she was sixteen as proof that she doesn't really have to be gay.  Maybe she just hasn't slept with enough men and should give herself an easier life by looking for a 'normal relationship', ignoring the fact that her wife is the love of her life.
People don't understand the concept of loving a person and not a gender, and when you say things like 'a straight person who identifies as gay' it sends alarm bells of 'see it IS a choice!'.  
Unfortunately we don't have enough open minds to appreciate what the kinsey scale could actually demonstrate, and religious and social pressures encourage a limited view point on the issue.  Whether the person is bisexual, gay, straight or at any point of the kinsey scale SHOULD NOT MATTER.  They're in a same-sex relationship now and want children, and should be allowed to, because it's two people who have demonstrated a willingness and effort to actually care for another person, putting them miles above some chav who couldn't figure out a condom.

Personally - i.e. myself as an individual? I find the act of censoring this particular song - either bleeping the words [typically ""fag"", ""slut"" and ""arse"" are omitted.] to be significantly more offensive than the word itself.

But if it offends you as an individual? Continue to push for continued censorship of the offending words.

It's worth pointing out the BBC doctored the song back in 2007. And similarly people used their voice to complain about it, resulting in the unedited version of the song being broadcast.

Hell even Peter Tatchell thought the editing of the song was stupid, and was a vocal proponent in having it reversed.

Again - speaking only as an individual, and commenting on my thoughts? The only people I know offline who take offence to the lyrics are paid up members of the PC Brigade, who take offence at anything that might even just possibly not be 100% Gay positive.

Ah, but the problem which occurs to me, is you are, in fact, doing it wrong. I agree this is how the system is supposed to work, but in practice almost all MPs closely follow the party line once they arrive in Westminster. In terms of the way in which your MP will vote in parliament, to elect a Conservative candidate means electing a representative of the Conservative party far more than an independent representative of the local area. We might say that we should work towards shifting the system towards that goal, but at present it seems to me local scrutiny and accountability are so nonexistent that it is a completely futile task to attempt to kindle them. Most people do not follow parliamentary process at all, most people would struggle to even name their MP. They are not suddenly going to spend a huge amount of time monitoring how their representative votes in the Commons, on top of monitoring how the national parties voted. There is not even a good mechanism for doing this, because local papers are so rubbish and monopolistic. And even if we did all spend a huge amount of time following parliamentary process in detail, it would be incredibly difficult to separate the issues at the election, and make a meaningful impact with a single vote one way or another. It's better to simply acknowledge reality, and work towards creating a fair, proportional system for doing what we already do, which is to elect parties, not representatives.

No credit cards or loans (or very expensive loans through specialist companies, or payday lenders although some of those won't even touch those with CCJs), a very restrictive range of much higher-cost mortgages, harder to get things like contract mobile phones, a lot of rental places will simply laugh you out of the building if you have a CCJ or defaults on your file, you can't work in certain professions and may have your employment terminated if you work in one of them... it's not consequence-free.

true,brainburger,null,null,"&gt;Because it would be completely unbelievable, and would therefore fail as a dramatic device.  

In the Dalek city on Skaro, there are no stairs. Our obsession with stair-climbing is bipedal chauvinism. If we humans had evolved differently, we might have been laughing that Daleks couldn't climb ropes, or snake through pipes, or any number of things.

Actually, stairs don't appear much in any sci-fi that I can think of!

As for levitation, maybe that's not technically possible in a space the size of a Dalek? The TARDIS can levitate, but it has huge spaces inside for all its workings.  If they can levitate easily, then why are they shaped like that? Why not float all the time? Mind you, the tech of *Doctor Who* is not very consistent and its asking a lot to make it so.

The thing about *Doctor Who* which may not be apparent to non-British people, or people too young to remember any of Doctors 1-8 when they were first broadcast, is that the show has *tremendous* cultural heritage in the UK. Daleks are iconic to the British. The fact that they had levitated prior to RTD's involvement was known only to a few kids and much fewer Whovians who were still watching it when it was unpopular under John-Nathan Turner. In contrast *everybody* here knew what a Dalek was and that stairs might pose a problem. (In fact, it used to annoy the hell out of me that people would state this mockingly, as though the writers were unaware of the issue, even though the show had used it as a plot device).

So, changing that is messing with an icon, and it's fair to say that the slight perceived silliness of Daleks is one of the reasons for their popularity, 'sink plungers' and all.

Imagine then the dramatic power of a searching or pursuing Dalek blocked by steps. Actually there might be some humour available in letting them use wheelchair ramps on Earth, as we have those in many places now. If not, imagine the darkness of a Dalek literally levelling a building, killing everyone inside. Why would it ever *need* to climb steps, when it could do that, at any point in time?

We still haven't seen how dangerous a Dalek could actually be. I don't think RTD made them more scary. I don't think Moffatt is particularly into them , and he has preferred his own Angels and The Silence to become the most formidable enemies, even allowing the Angels to manipulate time, which is traditionally the preserve of Timelords and Daleks only.  

I think it would have been great if the Daleks had been the aliens in the Torchwood story *Children of Earth.* That's the direction I would have liked to see, for Daleks to be dark, and intimidating. That would pose a much more interesting writer's challenge than just having them levitate upstairs, as some kind of Deus ex Machina.",0,1354046200,null,0,1354048088,0,c77nx75,t3_13tlo1,t1_c77nx75,t1_c77ldou,null,1430515679,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,BrunelStudent,null,null,"I do understand what you're saying. One of my friends who went with me tonight did say to me ""Sticks and stones"" which I think is a strong attitude. Of course he can say what he wants, ultimately he is wrong and he won't change my mind. In the end when he spreads a message of hate he will get more people who disagree with him. 

However I think the problem myself and other people protesting have isn't that we're scared of him speaking, it's that we disagree that a man like this should have a public forum in which to speak. I'm not going to pretend I'm a law student or an expert but I believe things he's said in the past count as hate speech, the Public Order Act of 1986 has been amended various times so that it doesn't just cover religion and race but sexual orientation. This man has been recorded inciting hatred and there doesn't seem to be consequences. I'd say that was a big issue for me. 

In addition, our university campus should be a place of acceptance for all people where we at least try to get along with peace. It should be a place of safety. And this kind of man, who openly opposes that message of harmony, doesn't belong in that environment. 

And I watched Nick Griffin on question time. I think it was positive as he was mocked for that. But a prime time tv show where the world could look in is a completely different forum than a meeting on a university campus I think. Put Usamah on tv and I'm sure he would deny his words as he has done. 

I wish we were allowed to debate him but sadly we weren't allowed to speak to him, even as he entered the lecture theatre. 

edit: Also in my first post I wasn't saying that Nick Griffin would never be allowed a public forum. I was saying that if I contacted the NUS representatives at Brunel saying I was inviting Nick Griffin to speak to my society then it wouldn't be well recieved. And if they even considered it the outcry from students of all races on campus would be strong enough to shut it down. Yet the same doesn't exist for Usamah. (Btw I in no way condone or agree with Nick Griffin or any views of the BNP. I'm just comparing two men each as extreme as the other.)",0,1354047183,null,0,1354048399,0,c77o853,t3_13vl11,t1_c77o853,t1_c77m54a,null,1430515822,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

In a region of oppressive governments and hugely manipulative extremists groups there are so much more you've got to take in to account when trying to work out why riots like that happened. 

One theory I saw talked about was the fact that people who live under oppressive governments that control information have a very very hard time fully understanding the American idea of free speech. That because a country lets people say things they must endorse the things being said one way or another and that given groups would use that to turn what is the stupid dumb insult of a small group in to a government that is not well liked insulting their faith.

I'm not sure I really subscribe to that kind of generalization but there are a lot of powerful people around who have a vested interest in making the west look bad for a number of reasons.

So an african woman visiting friends in the UK gives birth, the child will be a full British national, and that childs children (irrespective of where they are born) will be British, but someone who has a 2000 year British family history who just happens to be out of the country at the time of birth may not have a claim to British nationality at all.

I'm a IT professional, and RSI is a big concern for me, but its my lifestyle choice. For a lot of PC gamers RSI is going to be a problem in later life as well.

Then what about people who are into sports that might cause injuries, or extreme sports? Again that is lifestyle. It's their choice to do those sports.

true,hotcod,null,null,"I was using it purely as an illustration that ""their religion makes people react violently to offence"" is almost the *lest* likely way to explain those riots.

If you want to delve in to my post history you'll find me arguing that religion is being used as a powerful form of control by extremists taking advantage of a region that is currently in turmoil. It's a sad fact that people turn towards extremism in times of crisis, just look at the rise of Golden Dawn in Greece at the moment.

Extremists use peoples fears and manipulate them by offering what is almost always a false hope and almost always an ""other"" to blame their problems on, event he problems the extremists them self's create in their attempts to hold on to power. The west is currently that ""other"" because we offer an alternative to dictatorships and extremist religious groups. I've often argued that Islamic terrorism does not really aim to turn the west in to Islamic states but it's about making us undermine the freedoms that work as a threat to given groups.

My point is simply this, when you make posts imply that Muslims in general react to offensive with violence because they are Muslim you are ignoring thinking of that group as a group of people *as* people which comes with all the politics and issues *all* people have. I'm not saying there is no such thing as cultural differences or even that those differences can't be the result of the main religion of a culture. I've just never found any one who's been able to logically show that being Muslim and no other factors makes a person more likely to react violently when taking offence and that kind of thinking is deeply problematic.

To be honest I've more often than I'd like found it to the result of it simply being an ""acceptable"" outlet for racist people who find them self's in a culture that is really no long accepting of them holding those racist views. By cloaking them it all as ""criticism"" of a minorities main religion they think they can discriminate and that makes it very very important for people to examine the logic behind statements such as the first one of yours I replied too.

Just to be clear I don't think you are racist judging by how you responded, I think your logic is a bit faulty and your views some what scatter shot but I bring up this idea just explaining why I feel the need to press you on your logic. edit: which as a matter of fact half answers a question you presented elsewhere so that's good going I feel :)  ",0,1354054845,null,0,1354056139,0,c77qm7f,t3_13vn1c,t1_c77qm7f,t1_c77q8ov,null,1430516949,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,hotcod,null,null,"There is such a thing as confirmation bias and it is hard to debate someone away from the views they already hold because every one thinks they have good reasons for holding them. Which is why the science method has evolved along side the study of logic and reason both in a colloquial and academic sense. 

I like to think that when I'm proven wrong I accept it, adapt my views and move on. That's far from always the case I'm sure but It's actually a point of pride when, in a debate, I have to and more over am able to admit I'm wrong. The reason I'm spend time on place like reddit debating random people is not because I honestly think I'll change their mind but because I want to be challenged to change mine. I have learnt things about me and my views and ideas from our discussion and while I've clearly not had an impact on your views I feel mine are better than when they are started. 

Does that mean I'm never guilty of confirmation bias? God no but I try and make my self aware  of the moments when I resist listening to what some one is saying because it runs counter to what I *feel* to be true even when I'm sure of my reasoning for thinking it's true. My most examined views are those I feel in my ""gut"" are right because those are the views in which you are most likely to find problems with your logic and reasoning.

Given we've now stepped past the actual debate and you are now using a tactic that I find depressingly boring I'll just leave you with this... when you start arguing confirmation bias as a reason some one holds views different to yours it always worth spending some time looking in the mirror.

I don't think that they are penalising the working class at all. David Cameron said it best at the conservative party conference recently. Something along the lines of ""it isn't cruel to ask something of people. It's cruel to ask nothing of them.""

Alcohol price rise isn't penalising the working class imo. It's a good measure to improve responsible selling of alcohol by supermarkets who make their own brand stuff designed for getting hammered as cheaply as possible. You could say that fuel duty and road tax are penalising the working class by making it unaffordable to drive a car. Or if you're suggesting that getting plastered is a major hobby for the working class, then perhaps discouraging it isn't such a bad idea after all...

Cut of EMA I don't really know much about

University fee rise. Others have explained well, but I don't see how it penalises the working class at all. University is still free at the point of use and the loan scheme is pretty generous. If you went to uni and didn't get a decent job, you won't pay anything back, so it hasn't really cost anything. Alternatively, if you get a good job, you pay back. That's pretty good imo.

As when it comes to other parties in my area they are the only party that could do it, with any principles.

The UUP and SDLP did all the legwork for the peace process and the Good Friday agreement, only for the DUP to complain and and wait untill they were in a position to take control in a coalition with Sinn Fien, abandoning the mandate on which they were elected. 

The TUV (a breakaway from the DUP) have now a stance similar to a pre-power DUP which may be perfectly valid, especially considering the coalition partners, but its too late for such a stance now, and I'd be afraid of them pulling the same trick the DUP did.

It's when he speaks in public that his words can be challenged. When talking to his followers at his mosque, he has people hanging on his every word, and not a single voice of dissent will be heard.

Speaking publicly- be it on Question Time, at Brunel, or in Hyde Park, gives opponents the chance to tackle what is being said. Even if you can't tackle Abu Usamah's speech directly, you can protest against it - which you are doing. How often are there protests when he speaks at his mosque?

true,BrunelStudent,null,null,"That is true. I hope someone tonight did challenge him. I just said in a reply to lol_oopsie that I wish I had chosen to go to the talk, I was really divided in my thoughts but in the end I chose not to. 
What swayed my decision was being told that we wouldn't be allowed to question him, we had to be ""on best behaviour"" if we entered there. I agree that we shouldn't go if we plan to be rude but asking him about his own words to me isn't wrong. I'm sure he'd have arguments to answer our queries with. 

I do worry about Muslim students hearing him today and finding him compelling. I'd hate for him to gain support. I think it's the same with supporters of BNP, it only takes one little seed, say they tell you that Muslims commit more crime than white people, and a whole heap of hate can be born in a mind that is open to propaganda. Hopefully that won't happen though. 

Our protest was the strongest way we could challenge him I think. I'm not sure about protests at the mosque. I know he is an Imam at Green Lane Masjid in Birmingham and that I first learnt of him watching the Channel Four Dispatches Program ""Undercover Mosque"" in 2007. I think that really raised awareness of this man. Him speaking tonight really created publicity. Unfortunately it was mostly negative about Brunel but at least more people know about him and his hate which is positive.

true,allwork,welsh,Cymru,"&gt;Personally, I believe that degrees should be subsidized based on subject, pick the degrees which we are short of graduates from and almost fully fund them, whilst withdrawing a lot of funding for some others that won't even repay their loans on average. 

I often hear this said and just can't fathom it - many (most?) of the jobs currently in the market didn't exist when the people in them went to university. Who can accurately predict what degrees will make sense in the future?

This approach would just lead to over provision in areas that we 'think' are important now (computer scientists, geneticists) just when we don't need them. Better to make every degree count as a degree as well as 'training' for a career - which means robustness across the board not churning out engineering graduates because that's where the government subsidy is.

On two separate occasions, the Third Doctor implied that he may have been several thousand years old. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians , The Mind of Evil) Immediately after his sixth regeneration, his seventh self claimed to be 953. (TV: Time and the Rani) The Tenth Doctor later claimed to be 903. (TV: Voyage of the Damned) Also, at least prior to leaving Amy and Rory behind, (TV: The God Complex) the Eleventh Doctor maintained an age less than his seventh incarnation. (TV: Flesh and Stone, The Impossible Astronaut)

The eleventh incarnation of the Doctor later claimed to the Ponds that he was 1200 years old. (TV: A Town Called Mercy).

Promo shots are things you can find on any DW news bulletin or on the BBC site itself. But cosplays and artworks are unique and made by fans who love the show. Cosplays actually take a lot of work to put together. Even getting the color of the pinstripes correct on a shirt or the correct cut for a certain coat can be a pain. And there are lots of people who tailor and create their own clothes. And then the really crazy ones do full on prosthetics.

This is something of an argument against permanent floating, any higher than a couple of inches.(mentioned elsewhere in the thread). If they did that, then they wouldn't need to be that shape.

In *The Mutants* they explicitly move like dodgem cars, picking up electricity from the metal floor. Later in The Daleks Invasion of Earth they have overcome this limitation, and use 'something like the hovercraft principle'. One travels along the bed of the Thames, underwater, and comes up to ambush the Doctor and Companions. It doesn't need to fly to do this, but can obviously handle rough terrain.

I distinctly remember watching Bad Wolf when it first aired, but didn't get sucked in. Then started Netflixing the new series from scratch last week and was surprised to find myself hooked halfway through season 1. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances completely did me in! 

I fell a little bit in love with Eccleston's doctor and was sad to see him go so soon. There was an extra layer of subtlety to the 9th that I'm missing in the 10th so far--despite the anger issues he seemed to have a quiet understanding of human foibles, whereas 10 often comes across to me as morally superior and...well...smug, especially at first. He's growing on me, though. Had my heart completely broken by Doomsday tonight, even though I'm generally romance proof.

true,newbill123,null,null,"I started watching re-runs of the fourth and fifth Doctors (played in single episodes rather than multipart pieces) on PBS when I was about 12. I was introduced to it by a good friend who had transferred from across the country (I think his father, a nuclear physicist got him hooked).

The eccentricity and occasional punctuations of Hitchikers Guide like humor probably is what got me hooked more than the *save the world* scenarios. (The original run didn't have the production values to impress on me that anyone was actually in any danger.) An outsider, who knows he's the outsider, but still usually has the swag and confidence to handle nearly any situation also appealed to me as an unconfident teenage kid.

After high school, I kept up with some of the continuity when I got to college and found Usenet. But there was no opportunity to see the shows and I didn't get any of the books or audio dramas. In college I came out as gay, and had begun watching Russell T. Davies *Queer as Folk* which had a lot of references to *Doctor Who* and every friend that I knew turned to me as the Whovian expert. When it was eventually announced that there would be new *Doctor Who*, helmed by RTD, every friend I knew went out of their way to tell me to watch it. Someone even gave me a VHS tape of *The Curse of Fatal Death* as a thank you for explaining to them what Doctor Who was.

And I did watch the new show. And I have enjoyed it quite a bit. I was not a teenager any longer but I really enjoyed Christopher Eccleston's acting and the persona he gave his Doctor; I just wish there was more of him. David Tennant as the tenth Doctor and Matt Smith as the eleventh have also been loads of fun, but I do vaguely wish the plot lines they were written into weren't always so dire *we must save the world / galaxy / universe*. Even with the better production values, it's not the high stakes of failure that makes the show different from other sci-fi.

I think the companions in the new series are much better written than the ones in the old series. What really helps is that they actually have some sort of continuity planned for the companions to grow and change a bit from their adventures with the Doctor. Whereas in the original series they were usually there act as a sounding board for the viewer (""Why are we here Doctor?"", ""Run Doctor!"", etc). 

I do think they've gone just a bit overboard on the story continuity that must form a precise and laboriously explained plot points over the entire season, but for the companions arcs, its nice to see them grow and change. I won't list the companions I liked more and less than others (others will undoubtedly disagree), but there have been no cringeworthy characters I just can't bear to see. The worst problem with the modern companions? I think the writers sometimes can't ""let go"" of a character to finally write him / her out of the script and keep her going even though there's no where left for him / her to grow.

The River we saw at Big Bang/Pandorica was after ""The Wedding of River Song"" in her personal timeline. At which point she had already refused to kill The Doctor. The control they once had over her was gone.

Saying they blew up the TARDIS by controlling River is pretty vague. At that point in her personal timeline, they have no control over her.

In fact, there's a scene before she lands where the TARDIS acts weird and she doesn't understand what's going on. Then she lands. The monitor acts weird, she smacks it a bit but that doesn't do anything so she goes outside. When she's out, the monitor displays the date and then the crack appears. And then we hear the voice ""silence will fall"".

Then strange marks burnt in to the grass outside. Something was there and that's probably what pulled the TARDIS off course.

The TARDIS was pushed/pulled off course by an external force. River might have been on board but she didn't cause it herself, there's nothing to support that.

Then when she's talking to The Doctor after having been in the house, the TARDIS suddenly starts on its own and every attempt by River to stop it simply fails.

The Fifth Doctor is all pretty good, but his first story, ""Castrovalva"" and his last ""The Caves of Androzani"" are worth watching. The latter was voted one of the best episodes of all time by fans. I personally love ""The Black Orchid"" which was the last purely ""historical"" episode of the series. ""Earthshock"" is a very excellent story, but be advised it has many onions in the end. ""Arc of Infinity"" is an interesting story featuring Time Lord society.

true,matthewgola,null,null,"Well, I've heard a lot of sides to this ~~argument~~*discussion*. And with the emotional part. I agree with that, there would be a gender dis balance. And you are right, Brits are more open to the idea of omni sexuality, but the whole audience isn't. (to clarify, I have nothing against another's choice of sexuality) Also, I can't name the title of the episode, but when the Doctor, Rory, and Amy go into the Dream World where they meet the Doctor's ""bad"" side, he mentions that he is just going from one girl to the next. Not one boy to the next. In the beginning, the show was meant to open peoples mind to the idea of space, and what could be out there, along with educating the people. It converted into a scifi drama, after we all realized that we would enjoy a drama more, so yes, in my opinion, there has to be a sexual dynamic/ tension. Finally, would the Doctor be renamed the Doctrine? It wouldn't be accurate other wise, because he certainly isn't a medical Doctor, he is very much a academic doctor.

You know the stuff that comes on before the previews. It looked a bit interesting.. but I left in the back of my mind for a while. What made me decided to try to watch it was because two of my friends. They started talking about it.. I think I remember them talking about what they thought about ""the new Doctor"". Didn't know what the hell they were talking about, of course.. but my interested peaked.   
  
So, I finally watched Rose, or started to... I was a bit disappointed with the quality of it and was a bit put off. At the time, I didn't know anything about regeneration, or that there were different incarnations of The Doctor, so I was really confused when I was watching Eccleston.. I was thinking to myself ""Hey.. that's not the guy I saw in theaters.."" So, I decided to do a bit of research before I finished Rose. I somehow managed to stay away from major spoilers, but I eventually found out about the cast change overs. So, about maybe a week, or two later.. I managed to get through Rose, still a bit put off by the quality.. but the 2nd episode, The End of The World, is when I became enchanted with it. I got the sense that there was some huge back story I was missing, which to me, makes me want more. So, I kept watching and became more, and more engrossed with the story.

true,baycitytroller,cnty-scotland,Shang a lang,"The main source is the annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report (GERS). [GERS is compiled by statisticians and economists in the Office of the Chief Economic Adviser of the Scottish Government](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS).

At the moment Scotland is in deficit, as is the rest of the UK. The Better Together campaign produced a graphic which shows that Scotland actually receives 20% more expenditure than it receives (using figures from GERS). They hadn't really thought this one through and the graphic has now disappeared from their site (though it might just be my powers of observation). Their graphic, however did concede that Scotland produced 9.6% of UK taxation and received 9.3% of government expenditure (with 8.4% of the UK population - using mid 2010 est for UK and mid 2011 est for Scotland taken from UK and Scotland wiki pages). [This graphic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A5amm0oCYAEK766.jpg), in response, shows the picture when you complete the calculations for the rest of the UK (*the top part of the graphic is the original Better Together graphic*). Yes, Scotland does receive 20% more in tax than it contributes, but the rest of the UK receives 24% more than it contributes. And that is an extra 4% of a much bigger number.

This imbalance has been going on for a long time too. Last October Michael Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland, [produced a press release](http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/scotlandoffice/16142.html) that was supposed to shoot the Yes campaign down. Taking all government expenditure in Scotland over the last 30 years and setting that against all revenues (including oil and gas) Scotland would have a deficit of £41billion. Damning stuff. That is until you realise that the UK deficit over the last 30 years is £715.5billion giving Scotland a population share of around £60billion. That is an extra £19billion thanks to being part of the UK - or 46% more.

She went to various conventions both here and I think abroad, and has been watching since Tom Baker was the Doctor. She'd talk about Doctor Who and the conventions that she went to, but I never really understood it. I just knew her as my cousin who liked Star Trek and that Doctor show. I'd never seen an episode.

I got into sci-fi via a friend of mine - she introduced me to Stargate SG-1 and Babylon 5 and I was absolutely *hooked*. It was from there that I got into The Outer Limits, Earth 2, First Wave (oh how I love and miss you), Star Trek: Voyager (although I will admit to DS9 as being my favourite).

I didn't really get INTO Doctor Who until 2010/2011. (I was 27/28) via another friend of mine who was staying overnight and asked if he could watch Doctor Who when it came on PBS and I was like ""yeah, sure"". I watched that episode (It had Daleks in it. And that's all I remember) and I was pretty much hooked. Having BBC America and Netflix, I dove into it pretty much headfirst, with my friend and my cousin telling me what and who to watch.

I was already a TV junkie by then, and after reading a few articles in Entertainment Weekly about the big premiere of this new Doctor Who season and what a big deal having a new actor was, I was intrigued and watched The Eleventh Hour the morning after it aired.

Instant love. Of Matt Smith, of blue police box time machines, of Amelia Pond, of timey-wimey stuff, of all of it. Doctor Who immediately catapulted, after all of one episode, to the top of my TV show list. After that first season, I went back and watched everything starting from Eccleston. I'm now in college with a big ole Dalek poster on my wall and living in a suite with some other Whovian girls. Sometimes it's just the thought of a new Who episode that gets me through the week.

I think the show really played a formative role in my adolescence. It sounds ridiculous and cheesy, but Doctor Who helped to make me a better person. For various reasons, growing up I'd always judged a person's worth by their intelligence or outward success. It was around the time I started watching the show that I came to realize how utterly stupid that is. I learned a lot from the show about kindness, and trust, and love, and courage -- and I realized, with the help of some wonderful friends, that all those things matter so much more than intelligence. 

So yeah. On the surface, I'm not nearly as obsessive a fan as many others on this Subreddit; I don't own a single sonic screwdriver, I'm not super familiar with the pre-Eccleston lore of the show, and I've only ever seen each episode once.

Also, 10 seemed really depressed he had to regenerate although it was only 5 years, shouldn't he be used to it by now? It seems it was obvious him not wanting to leave and saying ""I don't want to go"" and BBC making a big deal was all fan service. Yet 11 gets to live 200 years between episodes.

And the practical kids went to college at 16, where they had hairdressing, motor mechanic and all other kinds of training, that would then allow you to enter the workforce ready with the skills you needed.

At what point did this all fall apart ?

I'd say it started with the YTS scheme, which put the onus on employers rather than the government funded colleges to train the kids - but at least they were getting a pittance of salary. And then of course that got abused, and we now have JSA which is even worse, in that we actively PAY employers NOT to pay the kids at all, while still getting the benefit of labour.

Nobody would put rules in place that would deny a British citizen access to emergency intensive care unless you want dead people, and what sort of government legacy would THAT be. If you block them access to basic health care, then they will end up with emergency health needs that are then taken care of in the ER. The costs of an ER is thousands of times higher than primary health care provided by a GP, or even in some of these cases by a nurse or health worker.

This is what happens in America, health care costs keep going up, because they block primary health care access to people who cannot pay for it, so it becomes emergency treatment when it isn't dealt with. The costs are much higher at ER level, and if they can't afford primary health care, what makes you think they will pay the ER bill? So the tax payer does (or passed in to heath insurance costs), and they pay many times more than if they had footed the primary healthcare bill.

true,therockingbed,null,null,"In response to 2, I have to argue series one lacked direction or over-arching plot. The characters learned who they were in the context of their powers. It was in the early days of the storm so the freaky shit that happened to them was entirely new to the characters and the audience. Alisha, in Series 3, argued that they were simply trying to survive whatever was thrown at them. The characters acted recklessly, as ASBOs are expected to. However, their immediate actions have outcomes and they must deal with them accordingly. What drove the first series was a sense of urgency. In this rapidly changing world where the most random of events could occur, our characters somehow lost that sense of finiteness until it caught up with them in the end (Nathan's death and Sally's search for her dead probation worker husband).

Arguably, the beauty of the series is its defiance of tv conventions. However, basic narrative elements still need to exist. What series 4 has failed to do, despite creating great television, is give urgency to these characters and their issues. The speculative fiction element of powers don't play the same role they used to. Deaths no longer hold significance. Their ASBOs are overlooked. The meta analysis of superheroes (and being given powers for a reason) is lost. The narrative is character-driven, rather than plot-driven, but thematically, the series has yet to frame itself. What do these characters have in common and why is it important?

Except it's worth bearing in mind that the calculation which the Scottish Office did balances the Scottish net deficit (excluding oil and gas) against oil and gas revenues for the whole of Britain. It only takes 12% of oil and gas revenues originating from the rest of the country to wipe out the 19 billion relative surplus you mention, and I'd be amazed if the breakdown wasn't significantly more balanced between the different parts of the union. In other words, you've strongly rebutted those figures, but not made a case on your own account.

Also, those figures make you realize how enormous the fluctuations are in fossil fuel revenues. They go from £12bn in 1984 to £4.8bn within two years, and then down to £1bn five years later. They dropped from £13bn to £6bn in one year after the financial crisis, just as the wider government deficit would have soared.

See this is not what was being said and I feel talking about how the minority can react with threats of violence to insult has very little to do with them being Muslim and everything to do with politics of extremists. My issue with the way people talk about these things is that it often implies that reacting to offence with violence is inherently part of Islam. It's not.

&gt;True enough. How many other extremists kill, though, in the UK, or threaten it? Again, it could be that it's not reported.

* BBC2: slightly more high-brow or less mainstream (but still popular) shows
* BBC3: experimental shows. Shows for young adults
* BBC4: very artsy, informative shows
* ITV1: family entertainment shows, generally considered trashier than BBC1 (but only slightly)
* ITV2: lowest-common-denominator TV
* Channel 4: slightly edgy shows, testing the boundaries of mainstream channels. Leading the way for great comedy shows (IMO)
* E4: Mostly US imports (albeit very good ones)
* More4: Lots of repeats and some original, high-brow shows
* Channel 5: lots of US shows and trashy UK shows
* 5*: does anybody watch this channel?
* Sky1: only available on satellite/cable. Family-oriented. Some US shows, recently branching out into original comedies with some success.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Honestly, I think it was an interesting theory, but not much beyond that. There's a lot of suiting facts to fit theories with it. Most of what we actually have suggests that it's a straight timeline.

Before season 7, the last time we technically see the Ponds is during God Complex, in which The Doctor drops them off for their own safety. So they're the companions that 'survived'. Throughout season 7 we see him struggle with this, where he constantly comes back into their lives, even knowing what harm he could possibly cause. The Doctor even tells Brian, as though he's trying to reassure himself, that Amy and Rory won't be companions that die or get left behind(Which is kind of what happens, they get left behind into the '30s).

And, most tellingly, you have TATM, where none of this is ever mentioned. The Doctor never says at the end that he's going to spend more time with them, and it's only suggested that he goes back to tell bedtime stories to Amelia. If there was a time and place for that reveal, it would have been there. It would have shown him going back to the beginning of the season, not going to Amelia's bedside. And then there's The Doctor we've see during the Children in Need special this year, which is most certainly different from The Doctor we saw at the beginning of the season. He's not The Doctor who got to have one last hurrah with his best mates, he's The Doctor that just lost his best mates. I don't think it really makes much sense that he became sad over the loss of his friends, time travelled to spend more time with them, and *then* becomes depressed over their loss.

true,johneth,null,null,"The channels that everybody can receive, regardless of how they get their TV (over the air, satellite, cable) are:

BBC (publicly funded):

* BBC One: the most watched channel in the UK. This is the BBC's main channel, which shows it's big budget / impact dramas (e.g. Sherlock, Luther), nature documentaries (e.g. Planet Earth, Frozen Planet), and mainstream entertainment (e.g. Doctor Who, Merlin, Strictly Come Dancing, The Voice)
* BBC Two: created to be an alternative to BBC One, showing more highbrow stuff, mainly documentaries (e.g. Horizon), artsy drama (e.g. The Hour, Parade's End), and edgyish comedy (e.g. Mock The Week, Extras, etc.)
* BBC Three: aimed at the youth market (16-30 I think), with appropriate documentaries, comedies and entertainment shows for that audience. I think the BBC also use it as a testing ground for new comedy (e.g. the Mighty Boosh, Gavin and Stacy)
* BBC Four: highbrow arts and archive channel - lots of documentaries, foreign-language imports (e.g. The Killing), archive music shows, etc.
* BBC News Channel / BBC Parliament / CBBC (children's TV) / Cbeebies (toddlers TV)

Then you get 'pan-BBC' things, like when they show Glastonbury or the Proms, they'll put it on lots of their channels, or when they show the Olympics, etc.  Mainly music and sports that get that done.

If you ever hear about a 'red button', it's basically a red button on your remote control that you press and you get somewhat interactive features or extra video streams.

ITV (commercial):

* ITV1: the first commercial channel in the UK. Makes the most popular shows (e.g. X Factor, Britain's Got Talent), popular soaps (e.g. Coronation Street, Emmerdale), and populist dramas (e.g. Doc Martin, Lewis, etc.)
* ITV2: female-oriented, shows add on shows to those above (e.g. the Xtra Factor). Also did things like Secret Diary of a Call Girl, and shows quite a lot of US imports (aimed at women).
* ITV3: repeats channel for stuff shown on ITV in the past
* ITV4: 'men's' channel, showing old shows, football, cycling, and stuff like that

Channel 4 (commercial, but publicly owned):

* Channel 4: set up as an alternative to everything else in the 80s. Makes a lot of 'edgy' stuff, new comedy, bit of new drama, documentaries. Seems to like showing Come Dine With Me a lot.
* E4: aimed at youth audience (like BBC Three) - lots of US imports, but does a lot of their own shows too (e.g. Inbetweeners, Skins)
* More4: no idea what they're targetting with this. Seems to do documentaries quite a bit.

Channel 5 (commercial):

* Channel 5: lots of US imports and films from a few years ago. Can sometimes be quite good, but suffers from an image problem (as in, it looks cheap and nasty)
* 5*: no idea, seems to be repeats of Channel 5 stuff
* 5USA: just lots of US imports from Channel 5

*Edit*: then there are the dozens of smaller channels that you'll find, like Dave (which repeat a lot of BBC stuff, but put ads in), and the Sky channels (which rely a lot on high quality US imports from places like HBO and AMC to get people to subscribe to Sky, a pay satellite company).

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;Homosexuality doesn't mean they are infertile, it means they don't want to produce children with the opposite sex (just like heterosexual people may not want to produce children).

It means they subconsciously want to breed with the same sex, that's what homosexuality is. Heterosexual people may not want to have children but they're still interested in the sexual attractiveness of the opposite sex which is their mind telling them to breed.

&gt;But that doesn't mean they don't want to have children AT ALL or care for children.

They can't have children though, a man cannot inseminate another man. The idea of artificial insemination, surrogacy and so on are not natural, they're all modern creations. If you're a gay Meerkat you'll spend your time having sex with a Meerkat of the same sex and eventually die without any offspring.

It's all good an well to want to care for children but it won't happen naturally.

&gt;In fact homosexuality is beneficial to society in the sense that they can care for children that aren't theirs.

You seem to have a different understanding of the word ""beneficial"" to me. Legs are beneficial because they allow you to walk. Sexual attraction to the opposite sex is beneficial because it allows you to create children. Sexual attraction to the same sex is a flaw that has no benefit to anyone.

Either the MET let DV continue that they knew was occurring just so they could do a big bust or these arrests are of people who they didn't have enough evidence against to previously arrest them for DV? Either way this seems highly suspect.     

Also why do they need to do raids to arrest DV suspects? Couldn't they just ring the doorbell and arrest them. It seems very American/paramilitary to kick down people's front doors when there was no evidence that they were likely to destroy evidence or flee. It also potentially endangers both officers and suspects.    

All in all a highly irresponsible move by the MET. Clearly they're more interested in playing politics than they are about tackling the extremely serious issue of domestic violence. In particular as they obviously knowingly let it continue just so they could get political points...      
 
PS - Many households where DV occurs unfortunately have kids. I'm sure it will do the kids a lot of good to be woken up by soldiers shouting and storming in first thing in the morning, then taking mummy or daddy away in handcuffs...

Now stop being so up-in-arms and insulting. I am prepared to have a reasoned discussion about whether the programming of a publicly-funded national broadcaster should reflect the wishes of a minority with a cultural attachment to the day, or whether it should be more inclusive owing to the higher than average viewership on that particular day and the wideshread desire for more relaxed easy viewing.

However, in even just the first couple episodes of season 5, she almost blew me away with how much she's improved.  She has the jealous and wronged part down pat, and the edge of insanity that she portrays whenever she talks about Arthur is very believable.

The best thing to look at for a comparison is probably the similar test applied in private international law of forum conveniens or forum non conveniens, where the courts decide if a case would be more appropriately tried in the UK or a foreign court. There's an increasing move to trust foreign courts more and more (under the banner of judicial comity) and I could see the courts being very slow and reluctant to actually apply a forum bar in extradition cases.

Not true. You can buy 4 cans of branded 4% lager (e.g. Stella 4%, Becks Vier, Fosters, Carling, Carlsberg, etc) for about £3 in most supermarkets. There's ~1.8 units of alcohol in a 4% 440ml can, so 7.2 in total meaning the minimum price for 4 cans is £3.24. That's a 8.33% increase in price. I typically buy these types of beer, not to pre-drink before I go out, but just for a drink after work.. or with a meal and so on.

Similarly, I like to pick up a bottle of red wine for dinner for £4 occasionally - I pretty much only buy the half price bottle (""reduced"" from £8) - its usually a chilean or spanish red). There's about 10 units in a bottle of wine (strength varies), so it'll be a minimum of £4.50 - a 12.5% increase. Again, I don't buy this to pre-drink or get drunk.. just a little luxury to go with dinner.

Why should I suddenly have to pay around 10% more?

I'm not part of the problem, yet I'm getting punished for it. There is very little evidence its going to make any difference to the problem which I think is cultural and nothing to do with pricing (look at the cost of booze in Ireland for example).

I think 'I don't want to go' perfectly fits in with Ten only being around for 5 years. Each regeneration is still a new personality and essentially a rebirth. A new chance for him to get out and explore and fulfill his own old (and new) curiosity.

Ten knew how long his past selves had gotten and was lamenting that relatively he'd had such little time. There's probably an interesting dichotomy there that not only did the not-long-lived regeneration want to keep going, but the overall person of The Doctor himself knew that this particular personality (his first truly peppy and positive one since at least Five) hadn't had much of a go round and was regretting what he may become.",0,1354108583,null,0,false,0,c78110e,t3_13wf4y,t1_c78110e,t1_c77xvlx,null,1430522014,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The idea of removing the 3rd place CL demotion sounds fairer on the teams that have to qualify for the group stages of the EL. Also awarding a place in the CL for EL winners is a great idea as it would provide teams with huge incentive to take the competition seriously because merely qualifying for the CL can be worth more than winning the entire EL.

The other thing I would say is that having 2 competitions is great because there's more glory. At the end of the season 2 teams get to have trophies in their cabinets instead of just one.

* Build some apps yourself - you're going to need examples of what you can do - again, with all respect, you need to show your own expertise to entice people. Speaking of which...

true,best_policy,null,null,"&gt; It means they subconsciously want to breed with the same sex, that's what homosexuality is. Heterosexual people may not want to have children but they're still interested in the sexual attractiveness of the opposite sex which is their mind telling them to breed.

Yet humans have moved past the point where sexual attraction always leads to children. That is my point. If you don't moan about straight people who don't want to have kids, then it is stupid to moan about about homosexuals who can technically have kids, but don't want to naturally, because it's more of a chore. Also you don't seem to quite understand the word 'breed'. Breed means to produce/rear children, not have sex.

&gt; They can't have children though, a man cannot inseminate another man. The idea of artificial insemination, surrogacy and so on are not natural, they're all modern creations.

Your point being? They're modern creations that work. Computers aren't natural, yet you're using one to type these comments. It's almost as if you're trying to use the word 'natural' to imply homosexuality isn't 'right', which would be stupid. The word natural is neutral and always useless in these debates (and arguable anyway). You don't have a point.

&gt; You seem to have a different understanding of the word ""beneficial"" to me. Legs are beneficial because they allow you to walk. Sexual attraction to the opposite sex is beneficial because it allows you to create children. Sexual attraction to the same sex is a flaw that has no benefit to anyone.

What a stupid thing to say. Here's a way homosexuality is beneficial: We don't need more people to breed. Here's another way: People who don't breed have more time to help care for other kids. (In fact, the ""gay super uncle theory"" is a possible explanation for homosexuality in humans). Lastly, they benefit society because they can adopt orphans. So to say it has absolutely no benefit is stupid.

&gt; There are many that make perfect sense of down syndrome too, I doubt you'll call that a beneficial disease.

I was rather referring to the theories on how homosexuality might have evolved to benefit humans. Down's Syndrome isn't comparable in any way (it's a chromosomal disease for a start, it's not something that could have evolved selectively).

We care for people with regrettable diseases because we have a society; these people most likely wouldn't survive if we had a wild society, yet homosexuality/bisexuality is something that exists in a variety of animals... and they seem to serve different functions in different animals, so to claim it's a non-beneficial 'disease' is outright ignorant.",0,1354113941,null,0,1354134387,0,c7820by,t3_13txz2,t1_c7820by,t1_c77zs5x,null,1430522477,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Audi A3 (5 door not sport and my daily car) - Other drivers seem fairly discourteous, tailgateing and cutting in quite a bit.  Personally I don't think it was the car or my driving, I think a lot of drivers just seem to behave like twats on the road.

Changing the habits of a large number of people is a very hard thing to do and while this is not a replacement for working on the underlying reasons for behind problem drinking it's something the government can do which they can be reasonably assured will have the impact they are looking for. 

In truth I think people some what under-estimate the kind of social and cultural impact that taxes like this can have. 

http://www.ted.com/talks/jonas_eliasson_how_to_solve_traffic_jams.html

Have a look at that ted talk, the important part isn't so much that a small charge cleared up congestion but that the people whose behaviour had changed often don't realise that they've changed their behaviour. For example the level of support for the charge charged from 30% to 70% over time *but* once it was at 70% about 50% of people claimed they'd *always* supported such a charge. 

My point? There are underlying social problems we need to deal with but the simple fact is that this change will most likely help easy the symptoms and may even in some ways help with the underlying problem. Does it suck for people who don't drink very much? well, yes but not as much as it's going to suck for people who drink lots.

We are not a united states (yet), and we have large disparities in political systems that mean that entire societies are run very differently. The EU is no-where near the unification as the USA, there isn't even fiscal union (although the Euro crisis is moving that along).

Until the Euro crisis the EU worked on the principle of small transfers (area one status and all that) based on money coming from a central pot. Massive subsidies of entire countries was not part of the set-up at all.

And, as for the transfers being on the scale of those within the UK. You are talking absolute rot. I don't know if it is ignorance or wishful thinking, but I suggest a fast Google on how much cash Germany (and others) and having to send southwards.

true,bluecalx2,null,null,"I'm no fan of Hamas, but I'd like to play devil's advocate here and bring up a few points:

* It's true that Hamas once had as its goal that Israel should be destroyed. They have since abandoned this goal, however they have no clarified what their stance will be towards Israel once a Palestinian state is established. There are still many radical elements of the party which are potentially dangerous though.

* Even if they wanted to, Hamas is far too weak to ever actually destroy Israel. Take a look at the latest clashes, or even more dramatic, look at Operation Cast Lead. Israel is very strong and Hamas is not a realistic challenge. That doesn't mean there can't be an occasional casualty and I'm not undermining that, but they'll simply never be able to destroy the country. It's not an even match. 

* Let's also remember that Hamas is *already* in power in Gaza. So that fear is already a reality. Will having independence make that situation worse? Or will it put more responsibility on Hamas to obey international law as a recognised nation within the UN? It puts added responsibilities on both states, which I'd argue is a good thing. 

* Hamas is also not in charge of Palestine, it's in charge of Gaza. An independent Palestine will require Hamas and Fatah to work much more closely together, which will require Hamas to become less radical. 

* And most importantly, I'd argue, the reason that Hamas has as much support as they do is that Gazans are desperate and very angry at Israel. It's going to be tough to fix that, but an obvious first step is allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. When we do that the right way, it can drastically reduce the amount of anger and desperation that is felt throughout Gaza and the West Bank, because they can finally start rebuilding their country. I predict that Hamas's popularity will fall quite a bit and maybe the Palestinians can even start moving towards normalising relations with Israel. 

TL;DR: It's complicated and we should be cautious, but a Palestinian state might turn out to be the best way to get peace and reduce the influence of Hamas. Call me an idealist. ",0,1354115937,null,0,false,0,c782hfs,t3_13xjny,t1_c782hfs,t1_c78181g,null,1435663604,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

Even more annoying when you adopt the I'm just a reasonable guy with a reasonable opinion to explain why after dozen more Palestinian children have been killed by Israel and the population of Gaza are locked behind a big fence the Palestinians are still ultimately to blame for why things can't move forward. 

First off Hamas is no worse than the state of Israel by any stretch. Both use human shields, both have repeatedly shown a callous disregard for human life. Both contain reasonable and humane voices who are undermined by the complete lack of a process to instate the Palestinian state.

Hamas was elected. The Hawks in Israel were elected. Sin Fein was elected. At some point you stop telling  people they voted wrong and accept that these people represent the legitimate grievances on the ground.

A functioning Palestinian state would not be obsessively firing rockets into Israel it would have far more interesting things to be involved in therefore Hamas is a red herring - it is a symptom of the stalemate nothing more.

60 years of bloodshed is enough - the time to act is now. Some concrete changes on the ground representing the foundation of a Palestinian State has to start to happen. The steps at the UN are exactly the right thing to start that process.

""Also, don't forget most of those voters will have simply voted for her because she was a Tory MP.""

So saying ""Which is exactly my point."" in fact makes no sense, which was why I made the comment I did.  You have the option to explain your point clearly, rather than insult people with whom you disagree.

&gt;Apparently some people here cannot fathom the possibility that the electorate can vote for a candidate because they like her, and not simply because she belongs to a particular party.

It's certainly a strong possibility for some of the electorate, but the fact that the seat has historically very large margins for Conservative candidates, regardless who those candidates are, strongly suggests that these people are not the majority in that constituency!

Someone like Gwenneth Dunwoody, who won a victory in a marginal seat in 1983 and kept it until she retired 25 years later, when it was lost to the Conservatives, would be someone who got a large number of votes because her constituents liked her.  Because it was a marginal seat, this was enough to swing it; in a safe seat it may not have been enough votes to make the difference.

We are not talking about a marginal seat however, and therefore there are so many people who vote Conservative regardless, that going independent is unlikely to work.  Ken Livingstone would be a good example of someone who stood against his own party as an independent and won, but remember the Mayor of London is a directly elected position, which necessarily lends itself to personality politics.  In national elections, most people consider themselves to be voting for the national government, and that tends to dominate decision making amongst the average voter. She would also have to be very popular, and lost the whip in a way that made most people take her side (e.g. Livingstone was seen as being unfairly treated by a centralised party machine rigging the rules against the candidate that most people wanted anyway).

&gt;Democracy does not mean that an ignorant opinion is just as valid as one based on evidence

Firstly, an ignorant opinion is not necessarily one without evidence. Eugenics, for example, is well evidenced, yet it's advocates are (imo, rightfully) detested for a lack of moral and ethical compulsions.

Would you agree that democracy empowers ignorant opinions, where those opinions are prevalent in the culture of the voters?

For example, Egyptian women had more rights under Mubarak, than they do under the new democratically elected government, who have enshrined Sharia law (and the subsequent restriction on women's rights) in their constitution.

&gt;democracy does not exist to give you ""choice"" or ""freedom""

Indeed, in fact I consider the two to be mutually exclusive. Virtually every law passed is a case of the tyranny of the majority.

&gt;it exists to ensure a stable and natural transition of leadership between generations and after a crisis - i.e. one without violent revolution.

Democracy takes the violence of revolution and integrates it into government. Failure to obey the majority will result in arrest, detainment and/or death. It is, for lack of a better phrase, mob rule writ large.

&gt;Democracy means that everyone's voice is equal regardless of their wealth

In an ideal world, yes. But politicians are corrupt, and lobbyists are determined, and it doesn't take long for the masses to become subjugated.

&gt;it is corrupted by consumer choice which uses marketing as a force of manipulating people to do things that might not be in their best interest;

I would consider virtually any political campaign to fall prey to this sentiment too. People get reeled in with election promises, they buy into the party with their vote, then get shafted once the election is over and the promises are neglected.

&gt;it is controlled entirely by wealth, not everyone has an equal say; this is not democracy.

It's really worrying whether CCGs will be able to handle the new responsibilities with current funding. From a GPs point of view, they'd say that's deliberate, as the Government can then turn around in 3 years time and say 'GPs have failed, so we're handing over the job to xxxx' instead.

Except this time, xxxx will be either the privatised Commissioning Support Units or any other bidder to provide the service. That would result in the majority of secondary care services (ie hospitals, community care and mental health) being run by the private sector.

Alternately, you could have played the other side of the coin and driven a lot more defensively, perhaps even meekly. If someone won't give you room to merge, you can either slow down to let them pass or you can speed up and wedge yourself in. Ditto for changing lanes.

So rather than driving with perhaps exaggerated safety practices in mind, you opted - via conscious decision - to drive like a dick and then blame the car for it.

Personally, I think that even before statehood, Israel should take the obvious first step and stop all the settlements and arrest any Israelis who attempt to build them illegally. The negotiations can't continue until that happens so the settlements only intensify the conflict and make innocent people on both sides less safe.

Lot's of really bad stuff happened post-WW2, the Palestine situation was created, we completely ethnically cleansed a couple of islands (e.g. Diego Garcia), conquered &amp; occupied Iraq (for the 4th time this century!). We overthrew the legitimate elected government of Iran and replaced it with a dictatorship in the 50s, starting a long chain of very destructive events. We learned from this covert regime change and repeated it many times until we progressed to the point where we were having Islamists overthrowing secular governments and turning places like Libya into even worse shit holes.

true,bluecalx2,null,null,"Well the UN has recognised Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 borders, to be the occupied Palestinian territories. According to international law and the UN charter, it is illegal to annex any lands that are captured through war. Building on occupied land and moving your citizens there is effectively a way of annexing it. The separation wall is continually rebuilt to help protect the settlers. Basically, Israel rejects the idea that it has an obligation to stop building. Even the United States is (at least officially) opposed to the settlements as a violation of international law. 

There are two types of settlements now. Some are officially declared by the Israeli government (illegal under international law) and some are build by right wing Israelis who wish to annex the land with or without the government's consent (illegal under both international and Israeli law). However, both kinds of settlements are given protections from the IDF, most likely to get the support of settlers in the elections. The settlements also mean that Israel refuses to declare what it believes its Eastern border should look like in a two state solution, making negotiations impossible. Not to mention that they're driving Palestinians off their land, which doesn't help foster goodwill. 

The problem is basically that the ultra right Israelis do not want a Palestinian state (or maybe just in Gaza, depending on who you ask). It's not that the government necessarily agrees with them, it's that they have to try to appeal to them, the moderate Israelis, and the international community in order to secure power. So the settlements continue and it's now blocking what was left of the peace process.

My experience 8 years ago, and I have no reason to think it's got easier, is that it's challenging to get your first job. Your in the usual situation that you have no experience, thus no one wants you.

I got lucky with InstallShield (my first employer) that they took me, a graduate, with 12 months uni placement work on about £15k.

It would have been just enough to live on (and tend to my tech habit a little), if I didn't have debts. Thankfully I could live at my parents, so that wasn't a huge issue.

Being near the large population centres of course helps, Manchester for me, London for many.

I spent a year doing first line tech support on email and phone. I hated it, but it got me the real world experience I needed.

I then got the job I have now, which was double the money, a lot more varied, third line and development. You have to do your dues, graduates who think they can just walk into top end jobs are deluded, and those that do, very lucky.

I'm not sure the job market is good at the moment, we haven't hired anything but support desk people recently, certainly nothing level entry other then that. But it's a way to rise through the company.

Bare in mind I have no idea what the immigration situation is US-&gt;GB, I know I couldn't just move to the US and start job hunting. Getting that infamous green card would be an issue.

I suspect you'll need a job before you can get a visa, so there's no harm in asking companies. Most UK forms do ask if you already have the right to work here, which may be a minor issue.

And whatever you do, be positive and expressive about what you can do, to quote Wil Wheaton, don't be a dick. But don't be shy either.

No, I don't think so. So we have another group, sort of religiously motivated but I imagine it'd come under political if at all. But I'm not trying to say you're wrong, just trying to give an idea of why some people might focus as they do.

Animal rights activists though: Do they do violence on people 'indiscriminately'?

Those are just vague memories of scenes that creeped me out though .Hmm, actually it continued in that vein for some years.   *The Green Death*,  *Pyramids of Mars*, *The Seeds of Doom* and *The Brain of Morbius*.  

Tom Baker is a British icon for his Doctor.

Then I remember reading the books, around the age of 10-12 I suppose. The books were about the first four Doctors. Later, *Earthshock* had a big effect on me, but I lost focus on the show during the late 80s. I suppose my age was in-between. I wasn't young enough just to be scared, and not old enough to appreciate the charm. or perhaps Colin Baker's coat disagreed with me. There was around that time some controversy about the amount that the BBC was spending on the show, and ratings were going down. 

The switch to Sylvester McCoy and reduction in budget just seemed to hasten its demise. The TV movie a few years later was a welcome addition, which I watched then with a sense of irony. I didn't like some of the non-canon material in that, and the style was too American. 

It was always waiting for a good quality re-vamp and was never out of the British cultural life, and so when RTD got the job with Ecclestone it was great news, but short-lived as it was announced after the first show that Ecclestone would be leaving after one series. After so many years Tennant seemed a rushed replacement for him, whose reputation in acting was very solid.

true,jaysabi,tardis,TARDIS,"I'll first say that I don't think any *bad guy* is evil in their own eyes. They're always trying to accomplish something they think is a worthy goal. Take the Weeping Angels, for example. They zap you into the past and feed off the displacement energy. They need to do this to survive, they don't do it because they are evil creatures. Same thing for the those sting-ray like creatures of Planet of the Dead. They devour people and turn them to sand, did it to an entire planet. Not to be evil, just to survive. It was their nature to be driven to eat as a fact of their biology, and they were doing what was necessary to survive. I view The Silence's motives the same way: not necessarily evil, but what they define as necessary nonetheless.

The Silence think they're accomplishing a greater good by trying to kill The Doctor, and they *are* trying to kill The Doctor. Remember, the first attempt to kill him was the exploding TARDIS which was the season-long story arc in Series 5. When that failed, they kidnapped Melody Pond and raised her to be a weapon. When she first regenerated in into River in Let's Kill Hitler, this was the first time River and The Doctor properly meet, and she attempted to kill him several times as she was programmed to do. She ultimately succeeds in poisoning him, but it was only in coming to realize the betrayal she committed that she was convinced to use her regenerations to heal him, something The Silence would not have anticipated. So the final attempt to kill him was as The Impossible Astronaut at Lake Silencio, which also was foiled twice, once by River which started disintegrating time, and then again by The Doctor through the Teselecta.

But the reason The Silence is trying to kill The Doctor is to prevent The Question from ever being answered on the fields of Trenzalore. I won't break down whether or not they're doing a good job of it, or doing it in the best way possible, but I conclude that they are indeed trying to kill him, and they are doing so because they believe it will accomplish a greater good. In the Universe of Doctor Who, I will not comment on the morality of that act as either ultimately good or evil, but from the viewpoint of the viewer, I believe it is undoubtedly a ""bad"" intention, as The Doctor is the protagonist of the show.

I don't know where you get the ""removed from the Middle East"" from.

It's a product of propaganda. Firstly you aren't applying the same rules to both sides. You are judging Palestinians by the most extreme individuals in that (imaginary) set, whilst there is countless ""officials"" like Sharon, [Sharon II](http://www.businessinsider.com/paper-israel-needs-to-crush-gaza-2012-11) wanting to crush Gaza, Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai wanting to bomb them [""back to the middle ages""](http://rt.com/news/israel-gaza-hamas-war-103/), and of course I don't need to rely on rhetoric but the countless acts of aggression by Israel above the persisted apartheid. (Some Jewish crazies have demanded the nuking of Europe.)

So to rearrange your quote:

&gt; Zionism won't be happy with independence, they'll only be happy when Palestine is removed from the Middle East.

Secondly though, your sentiment flies [in the face of reality](http://i.imgur.com/aQguN.png). There can be no peace because Israel refuse to give up land that was acquired through war, and international law is very clear on that.

I feel that if you incite hatred you should forfeit your right to free speech in a public forum. Maybe you disagree but I don't think there should be room in our country for open hatred and the law backs me up on that in the Public Order Act. The problem is sometimes there are consequences and sometimes there aren't and it seems to depend on who is commiting the crime and whether it makes the media or not.

Plus a major point is, as I'm sure you're aware, that most people do not celebrate Christmas in a religious fashion either. Given that ~50% of the population is non-religious/has no religion etc., it is entirely understandable that a group such as the NSS should question the amount of money a public body puts towards the promotion of one particular religion. The time and money spent on religious output by the BBC does not reflect the (dis)interest of the general populace. Religious observance is decreasing in the UK, while the number of hours the BBC gives it on various channels &amp; radio stations has increased in recent years, I believe.

Re your claim about it being a bit 'atheist', the clue is in the name: National *Secular* Society. Hence:

So they had to go back to 1911 where they left off and carry on trying to stop Sutekh.

At various points the Doctors take on it changes from you can't change history to, you can but you shouldn't to, you must change it if it's bad and back again.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"~ I don't think Henderson did very well. He and Gerrard were crap for the first 20 minutes, he improved after but not enough. 

~ Allen is feeling the strain of playing at DM for over a dozen games. He's a great contributer to the defence, but he does it from a more central role. He started off very well but it's clearly straining on him. Lucas' return can't come soon enough.

~ Should have been a penalty. But then, should have done better in the first 20 minutes, should have done more with numerous chances, should have had more than one striker.... let's be pissed off at the call but remember why it mattered. 

~ Having said that, could Dowd just not call fouls on Spurs players today? I know they didn't foul us as many times as we fouled them, but they committed more than the 6 fouls that were called.

~ You guys remember playing 2-D platformer videogames? Remember how when your character jumped, you could still move them left and right as they sailed through the air? Except there was always that rare game that popped up where, when you jump, you stay jumped. So when you mistime it, there's no adapting, you just have to sit there and watch your little guy fly across the screen and land on a pit of spikes, something you knew he was going to do the second he lifted off. *That's what our 1-2s are like*. If a guy plays you the '1' part of a 1-2, then runs directly into 3 defenders while moving away from goal, *you don't have to play him the 2*. 

~ Has another team been as wasteful from corners as us? I mean, aside from Liverpool circa last year. Agger and Johnson wasted them at the weekend, and the delivery was just poor today.

true,calu1986,null,null,"I want to start by saying that we did not lose because of the referee, we did not lose because of a dive. Lets stop looking for bullshit excuses for the poor play of the team, it is really getting old. 

Enrique was fiery and did everything he could and knew. He doesnt get MOTM (for me) because he was of no impact on the final third of the field. I must also say that this is NOT his fault, he is not a winger, he is not a striker, HE IS A DEFENDER! I dont know what rodgers was expecting to get from him today. 

Suarez is my MOTM, all the dangerous attacking chances we had went through this man first. He fights, he runs, he tries! It all comes to show that he has NO HELP whatsoever. 

Lets analyze the team... we play a 17 year old every game, he has a ton of potential and is very exciting, but he is still just a kid.
We play Downing on defense... When has ever shown any kind of defensive aptitude? When have you seen him being physical? He should never again be called for the starting 11. 
We play the good left back (Enrique) as a striker... -_- Really? 

I can keep going, but this is already getting depressing and frustrating. 

The best way for me to summarize everything is as follows: We are not a top 4 team, we are not even a top 10 team. We are exactly where we belong, you dont agree? Please someone tell me, when in the modern history of the sport, has a ""big"" team won anything playing a defender as a forward? 

I believe in Brendan Rodgers (still), but the club is just in a horrible situation. We overpay on mediocre (at best) signings, or we buy cheap players... You do get what you pay for, no? And no, I am not saying that allen, assaidi, borini and the other signings made this year will not have an impact (eventually).

The truth is that we are not playing for titles, we are not playing for a top 4, I dont even think we are playing to compete (not this year at least)

TL:DR; Im annoyed, frustrated, and pissed. I love the team, I really do, which is why it is so difficult to realize how low we have fallen, especially because we still havent started to climb up.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"**Suarez**: Did well, what we're used to seeing by now.  Worked hard, took players on, looked dangerous.  Had several very good chances at goal.  A few times was out of sync with players on the giving end or receiving end of a give-and-go, but was not alone in this.  Disappointing that he didn't finish some of those chances- on the Agger assist, or the break in the first half that forced a save from Lloris.  Denied a penalty; again, to be expected.  **8/10**

**Sterling**:  Had a few good runs, caused problems for the defense.  However, his final ball was poor, most of his crosses that I can recollect hit the first defender and were cleared.  Also held the ball up and dicked around with it at points when he should've passed it to keep the game going; only lost it a few of those times though.  Had some poor calls for fouls on Vertonghen, but fuck Phil Dowd anyway.  Looked decent when he drifted into the center, certainly more willing to run at the defense than our midfield for the most part, but nothing came of it.  **7/10**

**Own Goal**:  Our own goal keeps up its form, putting one in for us via Gareth Bale in a very satisfying- and hilarious- sequence.  Go to hell, Bale.

**Jose Enrique**:  Did very well, strong on the ball, sends good through balls, good dribbling.  Still has the unfortunate habit of occasionally holding the ball longer than he should, and lost it a few times as a result.  Almost had a goal, had a few good efforts.  Caused problems for the defense with his runs.  Defensively played well, especially considering it was Downing behind him.  **9/10**

**Jordan Henderson**:  Very solid.  Showing why he shouldn't be sold in January.  Nice distribution of the ball- a few misplaced passes, but that comes with the territory.  Fantastic workrate, covered a lot of ground, good defensive positioning, as usual.  Made good runs into the box when other players had the ball, looks like he's gaining confidence.  Unlucky with Bale's goal, both  in terms of the absolutely shit call, and in terms of the deflection.  Would have preferred to see Shelvey on for Allen or Gerrard.  **8/10**

* **Jonjo Shelvey**: Not much to say.  Perhaps somebody else can fill in for me.

**Stevie G**: Not up to scratch from the captain.  Gave more than his fair share of balls away, including the one that led to the first goal IIRC.  Did have a number of great balls, though, especially out wide to Enrique, Sterling, or Johnson.  However, for the most part he looked tepid on the ball, and unwilling to hit it when given space.  Didn't contribute noticeably on defense.  **6/10**

**Joe Allen**: While he didn't have one of his best games for the club, I thought he was good enough.  Passing was good, hit more long balls than he usually does, with mixed results.  Kept composure when on the ball.  Outmuscled at times, but he's a little guy, can't really fault him, and he fought well against stronger, bigger players.  Good positioning, had a few interceptions.  Broke up play decently, but I'll be glad to see Lucas back.  **7/10**

**Glen Johnson**:  Unimaginative going forward for the most part, and not great at tracking back either.  Probably one of his worst performances of the season.  Disappointing.  **6/10**

**Skrtel**:  Solid, except for that one play near the end that almost gave me heart failure.  Nothing special; did his job.  Had a yellow for a challenge on Dempsey, but I'll take it- it was very gratifying to see that asshole get messed up.  Also probably a good tactical decision.  **8/10**.

**Agger**:  What a stud.  Dangerous going forward, nearly had a fantastic assist, good at the back.  **9/10**

**Downing**: Should not be played at LB in the PL, especially with Aaron Lennon playing against him.  Doesn't have the right instincts or really even the tackling ability he needs to play there.  Hit in one or two decent crosses, but aside from that contributed virtually nothing to the offense.  **4/10**

true,ChristofferOslo,NO,norway,"Okay, lets sum this up.

* David Luiz played a good game, solid. Stupid yellow but all in all he did good.
* Ivanovic also quite good, not much to say about him except he's a tank.
* Azpilicueta is continuing his streak of great performances even though his crosses are poor.
* Cole did a decent job, a bit anonymous in defence but had a few good offensive involvements.
* Oscar ran and ran but rarely got the ball anywhere and seemed a little bit unfocused, lot of bad touches.
* Bertrand was invisible, seemed like Cole did all his work.
* Romeu played okay, but lost the ball a little too much, Mikel is clearly the superior choice.
* Ramires also quite invisible, at least *I* didn't see much of him, but he had a few decent runs.
* Hazard didn't really get his game flowing even though he had a lot of possession, nothing spectacular but an OK performance.
* Torres looked sharper than usual, actually had a few runs and some decent shots, but he falls far too easily and still tends to drift of into nowhere.
* Cech was solid as always, when the rest of the team struggles we can always count on him.
* Mata was probably our best offensive player when he got on, had some good crosses/passes and that great corner. We need him to have offensive creativity.
* MARIN! Didn't see many minutes of him but he seemed eager and got involved alot in those few minutes. Had a good cross and contributed with  creativity, seemed a bit lost and indecisive at times, but that's not weird considering it was his first game since pre-season.

MOTM: Luiz, Cech or Azpilicueta. 

* Negative: Lacked offensive creativity and a lot of players got very invisible, we played sooo boring and we created nothing on set pieces until Mata came on and had that great corner. Also the Manchester teams are pulling away fast.
* Positive: Defense was solid (not perfect, but much much better than recently), TORRES SHOT THE BALL TOWARDS GOAL! MORE THAN ONCE! David Luiz has gotten rid of the clumsy mistakes and Marin got his PL-debut. + We gained a place on the table.

* Is it just me or does Oscar get bullied off the ball WAY too much? Seriously, the kid is brilliant and talented but he gets wrapped up too frequently. I feel like if he could just detangle himself, he could get a thing going.

* Marin only got 12 minutes of play but he looked more alive in those 12 minutes than the rest of the team for the other 78 minutes. I want to see more of Marin + Mata + Hazard + Oscar. Subbing Hazard for Marin was kind of pointless, as one of the announcers mentioned.

* Our defense looked pretty foolproof last night, even when Ivanovic got angry and decided to stay forward for a bit. Tell me why we run 4 defenders plus 2 holding midfielders again?

* Torres didn't look awful but I'm still expecting higher quality off-the-ball plays from him. At least the announcers said his name a few times.

* The crowd and the fans booing Benitez probably isn't helping the way he thinks about our game. We want to be impressed, we want goals, we want brilliance from Hazard + Mata + Oscar, we want nailbiter games with last minute wins. Benitez has to prove that he can handle our game but his first two games leave a lot to be desired.

One sunday I decided it might be fun to get the BMW 328xi and go to the beach. I had been to the beach the day before in a Prius, but I felt like going again, and I thought it might be nice to try driving the BMW on the way.

It was like driving into the twilight zone, and everyone had gone psycho as I'd stepped into the car. I'd try to change lanes and people would so abruptly and aggressively cut me off that I had four or five near collisions on my 20 minute drive to the beach. Several times they decided to deliberately parallel me to prevent me from being able to change lanes... which of course forced me to drive like a dick if I wanted to get where I was going. (Hint: your Corolla is pretty much standing still compared to what that beemer will do if the driver decides to merely touch the accelerator a little more firmly, so don't bother trying to prevent it from getting past you if it really wants to.) When I got to the beach, as I was trying to parallel park people behind me got so insane they actually leapt out of their cars and ran over to my window to scream at me, only leaving after I took their photos and announced I was calling the cops. 

None of that had happened the day before, at the same time, with the same route and parking space, in a Prius. 

So, while there are assholes driving BMWs, I try to remember that if a person in a BMW is driving like an asshole, it may be because they've been taught that they have to. And I don't take the BMW from my car service any more unless I have to.

Oh, yes, and as for the car, it accelerates nicely but not especially more so than a Volvo S40, is generally pleasant enough to drive, the seat is just a seat, the controls all feel just a tiny bit clunky (I suspect deliberately so), but it has a really nice turn signal. I thought the interior was kind of ugly. Generally it feels like it was designed by German engineers for German engineers.

For instance, I know NOTHING about dishwashers, but at some point I will buy one. It would simply never go to Comet and rely on a member of staff to show me dishwashers since I know they'll try to sell whatever has best commission and not what's actually best for me. I'd google, look at a couple reviews, see what the key features of a dishwasher are (like water used, noise, speed or whatever) then decide my price range and order online.

I'd also probably struggle to fit a dishwasher in my car, and if I'm going to get Comet to deliver, why didn't I just order from Amazon?

I do know about cameras, and most times I ever went into a Comet I was always disappointed about their range, and the information they had on display was useless.
