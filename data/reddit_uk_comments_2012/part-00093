Nope, I'm saying that we DO support them, at a level that is too high, and it's NOT WORKING. The welfare state such as it is was meant to be a stopgap when people fell on hard times, not a lifetime pension. And certainly not as you suggest, so they have spare money left over at the end of the month.

Seriously ? We shouldn't just support them, we should now actively fill their savings accounts ? While millions of WORKING taxpaying people on low end wages, part-timers balancing two or even three jobs are WORSE off ? What kind of a fucked up incentive is that to get people back to work ?

People on benefits HAVE to be at a lower level than the lowest minimum wage earners, otherwise there is no incentive to better themselves. In the early 80's there were tons of jobs ... yet surprisingly no one on the dole wanted them, because they'd be worse off.

Depends on the role or sub sector in IB too. Im 'fairly' well connected and from what I hear from the people in the know things are grim prospect wise and look awful going forward. 

The best way I can explain it is if I could go back 6 years I wouldn't have gone into the city. 

Also, just my personal opinion, but IBs are like an extreme microcosm of a sterotypical victorian class system. You have back office, middle office and front office. Im sure you can work it out how it works out. 

the only decent people you find in Those places are those doing the jobs which you see as a stepping stone to getting to front office which is where the action is. The other roles are largely boring as fuck. I've been in all three environments. Once you step up you are subtly expected to shun your old team and they kind of look at you as if you have sold out.

Needless to say the best roles are saved for the cuthbert Huntingdon-smithes of this world. You can get to where you want to be but you need to be border line autistic in your brilliance to get to the level they start out at...

Except more violent crime *isn't* being committed, it's apparently just getting more media attention; our homicide rate in the US has been nearly halved since the early 1990's. It's not due to a decrease in firearms either, we now have more guns than people in the US and many states no longer require any sort of license or permit to carry a handgun.

I don't want to sound cold-hearted... but 12 people only represents roughly 0.00000003% of the US population if you actually do the math. When you consider that a ""spree shooting"" like this usually occurs once a year, your chances of being killed in a similar shooting on any given day are roughly 0.0000000001%.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I don't have any stats, but one of my close friends was involved in a shooting massacre and narrowly escaped

Yeah, that's simply not enough to go on. Your chances of being the victim of a ""random"" shooting are pretty much zero in the US, despite what international media would have you believe.

&gt; compared to the UK and other European countries your death via firearms is significantly higher.

I'm not concerned with ""death via firearms"" statistics, though. The US has a lower ""death via knives"" rate, does that mean we're a safer country? Of course not. You need to look at overall violent crime statistics. The truth is, violent crime is far more prevalent in the UK than in the US. Our homicide rate is higher, but you'll find that something like 96% of homicide victims are themselves violent criminals; in other words, it really doesn't affect the ""normal"" civilian just minding his own business.

&gt; There's no needs for guns as self-self-defense; if there's no guns on the streets, having firearms for defense just heightens the hysteria and paradigms involved with gun ownership.

How do you propose we reach this ""no guns on the streets"" thing? Passing a law making guns illegal wouldn't even come to close to accomplishing that.

&gt; I agree with you nonetheless, guns do a have a genuine use, but do you really need semi-automatic rifles (AR-15s)?

Unless you're talking about a musket or bolt-action rifle, pretty much all guns *are* at least semi-automatic. An AR-15 is no more lethal than the hunting rifles you guys have over in the UK... it just ""looks mean"" because it resembles the weapons carried by the US military.

&gt; how was this man able to buy multiple weapons and 6,000 rounds of ammo without even raising an eyebrow from officials, plus he purchased all this within a three month period, a recreational shooter would (I hope) buy once the need arises not and certainly not suddenly, like so.

I bought my first firearm (a handgun) two weeks after I turned 21, a month later and I had 8+ various handguns, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. I can't explain it to you, man... but I suspect it's similar to the reason women buy multitudes of shoes and purses that they really have no ""need"" for. It's not strange for somebody to have 6,000 rounds of ammunition either. People buy in bulk to save money and use the same ammunition for months.

&gt; Please forgive me for being ignorant, I'm just using common sense to find out why he was able to do this, here's hoping this tragedy will never happen again.

He was able to do this because guns exist, and this tragedy surely will happen again. I know this is the answer nobody wants to hear... but shootings like this simply can't be prevented. Would it be nice for nobody to die at the hands of others? Of course. It's an impossibility though, and some of the measures proposed (throwing out the baby with the proverbial bathwater) would do far more harm than the occasional spree shooter.",0,1342901852,null,0,false,0,c5hd1ea,t3_wvuqc,t1_c5hd1ea,t1_c5hcrt7,null,1429434322,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't see how it would make NHS care worse. If anything it lightens the load on the NHS because they don't have to pay the private hospital for that operation.

A lot of people hate on private hospitals, and I saw that they were really slanted in the independent article comments too, calling for the NHS to get out of private care altogether. As nice as that would be, people are forgetting why we have this in the first place: because of the long waiting lists. You can't simultaneously want shorter waiting lists and no involvement in private care, there simply isn't enough resources to make that happen, and the budget is hardly going to allow for more NHS hospitals to open to relieve the burden either.

I don't really know what the solution is, but as much as I'd like the NHS  to not pay money to private healthcare providers, there is simply no way around it in order to relieve the pressure on the waiting list and make sure people get treated in a decent amount of time. In terms of the care it's going to be the same, you'll be treated by NHS doctors just the same, and the NHS will just pay the minimum costs to treat you (and indeed you don't get all the amenities a private patient would there).",0,1342904851,null,0,false,0,c5hdnt3,t3_wx599,t1_c5hdnt3,t1_c5hdb5f,null,1429434618,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm all for benefits - people fall on hard times through no fault of their own and I'd hate to think that families are suffering while the government stands by and does nothing. However - and working as part of the benefits system myself I've seen this all too much - there are people that take advantage of the system. 

The benefits system is ridiculously complex, with far too many loopholes. People are able to exploit these to get money that they shouldn't be entitled to. This fact doesn't mean that we should prevent those who are genuinely hard-up from claiming benefits, it means we need to tighten up the system to stop as many people exploiting it. 

With regards to actually having children - I completely agree that if you can't afford to raise a child then you should think twice about having one. However there are many instances where pregnancy is unplanned, or where perhaps circumstances dictate that people are unable to financially support a decision they made 9 months previously. Again, I don't think these people should be punished by receiving fewer benefits because the minority exploit the system. 

TL;DR - The system needs to be tightened up to prevent people exploiting it, rather than punishing those who genuinely claim.",0,1342905117,null,0,false,0,c5hdpt9,t3_wx1kx,t1_c5hdpt9,t1_c5h860o,null,1435699071,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That might be fine in moderation, but it would certainly lead to a more politicized House of Lords than currently exists. Teachers would fight teaching reforms, bankers would fight banking reforms, and doctors would be doing deals with the government to let through anti-terrorism legislation in order to reduce pension cuts. It would be horrible. There should be people from various professions in the HoL, but they should not be representatives of the professions.

Also, there would be no fair way to divvy out the seats. Do doctors get more than lawyers or less, and what about scientists? If it is decided by the size of the workforce, are we going to have a majority of the Lords made up of admin clerks, shop assistants and so on?

Edit: Incidentally, the means by which people are appointed at present is described [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4828094.stm). On the one hand, there are people recommended by the Appointments Commission, ""with a record of significant achievement within their chosen way of life that demonstrates a range of experience, skills and competencies... who are able to make an effective and significant contribution to the work of the House of Lords"". On the other hand, the Prime Minister allows party leaders to choose people, who are then vetted by the Appointments Commission, essentially solely to determine if they are crooks.

If you'll excuse me taking the opportunity, my modest proposals for reform are: 

* Peers should be appointed to 15 or 20 year terms, because at present someone relatively young will stay in the House of Lords for an incredible time- that atrocious Baroness Warsi will still be legislating in 2050.

* There should be a cutoff at age 75 or 80.

* The number of peers appointed should be limited (perhaps a quarter or a third of the House within each five year parliament, to match up with their term lengths), in order to prevent PMs abusing their ability to appoint members, and flooding the Lords in pursuit of party political gain.

* The number of peers that party leaders are allowed to appoint should be split according to proportions of the popular vote, as a counter-balance to FPTP.

* The appointments commission should be given more authority to challenge those political appointments, with a specific order that they must not allow people in who have exercised no greater public service than blind obedience to one party or another.",0,1342909799,null,0,1342912837,0,c5hepi1,t3_wxssj,t1_c5hepi1,t3_wxssj,null,1429435196,57,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,57

Pharmacies get a small dispensing fee for every item they dispense (around 90p) and the government pays them a certain amount to dispense that drug. The pharmacy pays their supplier for the drug, and so whatever the difference is, that's their profit. The government changes around what they will pay you, according with the drug prices and trends. Bear in mind that Boots and Lloyds are owned by two drug distributers, so they'll get their stock at rock bottom prices.

A normal high street pharmacy will dispense ~500-1000 items a day. The busiest one I know of does 2,000 items per day. So take their 90p per item fee, and then add the profit they make on top, bearing in mind that Boots and Lloyds will pay the least possible. And a rough average of the ""profit"" per item is about Â£3. So for a very modest 10,000 items a month that's Â£39k of income per month by my maths. If you're doing 1000 items a day, which isn't uncommon whatsoever you're talking over 100k of income per month. You have bills, and have to pay assistants etc, but there should still be a fair chunk left over.

They also get money for offering services like the morning after pill, methadone dispensing, supplying drugs to nursing homes. And lots do some wholesaling too. Without a proper wholesale license you can make around 4k/month from that. Also they sell over the counter items too. 40-60% profit margin on those. You could easily get a few hundred extra per week off that.

It's very ""easy"" to make 100k, though obviously it's hard work and a lot of responsibility. But unfortunately, boots and lloyds take most of that money and own the entire market :/

I don't think we can really go back though. Seizing private businesses is a step too far. But this was just an example of how one country can do things so differently to another. We've allowed ourselves to be dominated and ""owned"" by a few huge companies, and it's completely quashed normal people from trying to join in the market.

Nowhere do I advocate, unlike some others, removing welfare.  I've even said food stamp schemes are probably too problematic to attempt.

If families deliberately have an extra child/children to reach the handout level, so be it.  Voluntary sterilisation should of course remain free no matter what someone's family size.  And in all cases there should be counselling so you have a layer of medical attention that might prevent a ""coerced"" procedure.

If someone already has three children, and lives with someone so domineering and abusive that they are able to coerce them to get their tubes tied to get Â£10,000, then really that's not such a problem.  If your partner is coercive about that, they're probably going to be coercive about you handing over your welfare money to them for booze/gambling rather than to buy your kids food and clothes.

Spurs' signing of Van Der Vaart made a bigger impact than Manchester's Chicharito. That tipped the balance for me. But the game that turned me completely to Spurs was against Inter. Spurs were getting destroyed and had been playing with 10 men very early on. Then Bale just turned beast-mode on and Inter were trying desperately to hold on.

...The day after the game finished when we went into School, all the non arsenal fans were in 1 area talking about the game. I didn't really have a team, so when I was asked who I supported, I just said Man united because my elder brother supported them... bare in mind I was really young, I won't say how young exactly but I was under 12.....

Anyway, there was this kid in my school who nobody liked. Whenever we played football he always kicked our shins and acted like a real twat, pushing and cheating by making up his own rules. Unsurprisingly this fat  cunt supported Arsenal. I think he was a year older than me I can't remember, probably 2 because of how overweight and huge this asshole was. Honestly, he looks like the michelin man. 

There were maybe 5-10 Spurs fans in my school and Darren (The cunt) was bloating to them how Arsenal were going to win and shit. 

So, the day after the game we see him come into the the playground, and  we ran towards him laughing and saying how crap arsenal are for losing. He gets pissed off and starts pushing one of the smaller kids over, (I think it was someone who wasn't even involved, just there to see what was going on) and then gets told off by one of the teachers.

That's about as much as I remember of that, but we kept making fun of him for a while. I didn't understand why, but a week or so before the final against Nottingham Forest, I found out that Tottenham were Arsenal's rivals, which meant I could support a team a guy at my school I don't like, hates. And they were a better team than Arsenal at the time, too so I could laugh at his face every time we won.

That's when it clicked, and that's when I started supporting Tottenham, not because of some football magic I saw, or because of a world class player, it was because of an Arsenal fan who was a giant (literally) prick.

But since then, Arsenal have been the better North London team, there's no denying that. I guess if I had chosen to support Arsenal, who knows what would've happened. Would we be looking at a Tottenham team who won the league in 2003 undefeated?

Nah, probably not.

There is only a minuscule chance that the warming, which is undeniable whether you think it's natural or human caused, is a result of something outside of our control. Climate can and has changed significantly in the past, but to assume that our emissions have no effect and this warming would have be measured regardless of our actions is very ignorant.

We were down 2-1 after some horrendous refereeing decisions from the away leg and needed to win to go through to the semi finals of the UEFA Cup.

Sevilla went 2-0 up after about 10 minutes with a Kanoute goal and a Steed Malbranque own goal so we then needed 4 goals unanswered to go through because of Away goals. Cue 60 minutes of uninterupted Martin Jols blue and white army and we only want 4 goals chants including throughout half time (No alcohol is served during UEFA Cup games so most people stayed in their seats) only stopping when we equalised at 2-2 and a lot of people got nervous and hope kicked in. If it was a Hollywood film we would have won 4-2 with a last minute goal but I am weirdly glad we didn't. Without the lows the highs aren't as high.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Blink is a great stand-alone episode.  Unfortunately it deals very little with the Doctor himself, it's mostly Sally Sparrow's adventure.

The Fires of Pompeii is a good episode, one of the first with Donna.  You get Tennant to explain how some events are fixed and others are not, and a lot of the confusing stuff is explained (TARDIS translator).  It's got some very interesting scenes, but it's mainly a lot more serious.

Vincent and the Doctor is pretty solid, it has a very touching story line that will make anyone tear up, and you don't necessarily need to see the rest of the season. There is one moment where Amy cries that most people won't understand unless you've watched the rest, but overall the episode is quite good.  You get to see minor changes to time, it has funny bits, and serious bits.  The only downside is that it is Smith over Tennant, but that is just my opinion ;)

What would they have to gain? What's the motive? What it shows above anything else is that climate change deniers don't publish articles. The figure was 97.5% for the top 200 also so the scientists that are most knowledgeable all accept the concensus. What's so hard to accept? Why are people so ready to take scientist's word for it when they take medicine or something but have a double standard for climate change? What belief is it challenging and why would you rather hold that belief than understand the evidence? I can understand Exxon and other oil companies ignoring it and outright lying but somehow the general public have been hoodwinked. Again what motive would hundreds of scientists have to lie and encourage huge reorganisations of power sources? Because they just hate people? I don't know. Its bizaare and very frustrating.

&gt;Back in the late 90s, the only way you could watch the Premier League in the States was on pay per view cable stations. I lived in Boston and had a black box on my cable, so every Saturday or Sunday morning I caught the early game or a replay from the day before (surprisingly one channel over from the Spice Channel, classy!). That's how I first got exposed to football outside of the World Cup.
&gt;
Fast forward a few years and every game I started regularly see was Arsenal this and Arsenal that. In the 2003-2004 season that featured ""The Invincibles"", I started to realize the scorn I had for them that built up over the years, and the irrationality of its nature, similar to the irrational hatred I always had for the Yankees (for obvious reasons, being a life-long Bostonian).
&gt;
On April 25th, Arsenal clinched the league at White Hart Lane; it was the first time I really noticed the atmosphere at the Lane on my crappy TV. Spurs barely got broadcast at all; every game I saw over the 4-5 years I started watching as a neutral had Arsenal or United involved 90% of the time.
&gt;
Watching the supporters at the Lane was awesome. Playing their biggest rivals, the atmosphere was intense, especially with the stakes that were on the line. They were louder than any of the numerous home Arsenal games cable shoved down my throat. Why wouldn't I be drawn to the biggest rival of the team I've grown to loathe? The rivalry even had the underdoggish/lopsided nature that I'd grown up with my whole life supporting the Red Sox.
&gt;
Later that fall, I was gearing up for the greatest week in Red Sox history. I was even heading to Fenway for Game 1 of the World Series that night to watch it in person. Instead of all the fanfare and pre-game stuff to do that morning, I was glued to stolen pay per view, watching Spurs host Bolton.

One experienced CB and an acceptable mid-field in each half meant we dominated possession but our makeshift front lines meant we couldn't do anything with it.

There were a few ""not today, kid"" moments where our youngsters went up against their veterans.

Suso looked good playing further back in the mid-field, like what he just did for the Spain U-19's.  Pacheco showed good positional sense but then didn't have the pace or support to do much with it.  It's a make-or-break season for him and if he were playing with Suarez and Gerrard making the attacking triangle instead of Eccleston and Adam it probably would have worked out better.  Sterling looks to be growing in confidence every day and could be special.  I agree with Rodgers that a season on loan would probably do him some good.  He's too good for the youth or reserve teams but not quite ready for prime time.  Morgan did well to get his goal; I'm not sure what his future is, though.

Among the veterans, Aquilani showed a better understanding of the system than just about anyone else.  He was quick in possession and made good passes.  Enrique looked a bit bored.  Cole was hit-and-miss, as always.  Adam looked every bit as bad a fit for the system as we have feared.

The first could work but I feel it may be unfair to those that DID watch the newer episodes and want to discuss speculations. Extending to previous seasons might be a bit of a stretch but seeing as people still might not have seen the episodes then what can be done is this:

Whenever ANY episode is discussed, either by question or by something one noticed (even episodes from the Eccleston era) the tag should exist.

For example, given a recent post referencing S7E01, one could say that [spoiler](/s ""the episode will contain at least one of every type of Dalek since the series began"") can be a spoiler to most since it has not yet aired and not everyone looks up spoilers. But the same could technically apply to saying [spoiler](/s ""Mickey returns from the parallel dimension he stayed in during Rise of Cybermen/Age of Steel"") because there could be those that are slow in watching the series.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It seems crazy to us. We could never comprehend it, not one tiny bit.

Dude, it's crazy to Americans as well. Despite what the media would have you believe, your chances of being shot in a ""spree shooting"" in the US are pretty much zero. We're a country of 310,000,000+ people; the 12 people who died in Colorado the other day represent just 0.000000038% of the total US population. When you consider that spree shootings like this happen on average once a year, your chances of actually being shot in a similar tragedy on any given day are roughly 0.0000000001%. Your chances of being killed by a drunk driver are hundreds (if not thousands) of times greater than your chances of being killed in a spree shooting. Nobody calls for the banning of alcohol when a drunk driver kills a minivan full of young children... that's somehow an acceptable loss. I'll never understand the logic. How can you call for the banning of guns when alcohol causes so much more death and destruction? Guns at least serve a slew of legitimate purposes (hunting, sporting, self-defense) while alcohol serves a single illegitimate purpose of inebriation.

Here's what nobody wants to hear: We're going to see another tragedy like this again, probably in a years time. You simply can't stop it. We have more guns than people in the United States right now, almost none of which are registered in any sort of database. You can't just say ""alright guys, everybody drop by the police station and drop your guns off tomorrow"" and expect shit to go smoothly. Criminals (still armed) would have an absolute field day and the homicide rate would probably double over a period of a couple weeks; knowing your potential victim is completely unarmed is hugely empowering for an armed criminal.",0,1342933216,null,0,false,0,c5hjfv0,t3_wvuqc,t1_c5hjfv0,t1_c5hb2qq,null,1429437429,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

8 Defenders over 21 (Cole, Bertrand, Hutch, Terry, Luiz, Cahill, Ivanovic, Ferreira)

3 GK over 21 (Cech, Hillario, Turnbull)

That leaves 8 spots left, 7 if we end picking up a new RB.

Right now we only have Malouda Mata Ramires and Marin that count toward our squad as 25 man squad as Hazard, De Bruyne, and Kakuta are all U21. This means even if we did pick up Hulk, Willian, and Moses and a new RB and didn't sell Malouda and didn't send anybody out on loan we would still only have 24 spots filled.

true,redem,null,null,"&gt; what I recall reading before was, for example, in admittedly less than mainstream peer-reveiwed journals, that permaculture at least equals and at most substantially exceeds the production per square acre of monoculture 

I find that hard to believe, if we're talking about regressing to historical small farm methods of farming then we already know they're less efficient by about every measure. If you mean something more specific you will need to specify.

&gt; but then the practice is hardly being tested at all because the big players are rabidly opposed to it

I fail to see why that would matter. Small farmers exist, you only need one to agree to be a testbed, no permission from ""big players"" is needed.

&gt;  I certainly don't accept that agribusiness is less harmful to the environment than permaculture farming (though it may well be better than trying to use the same industrial practices in a scaled down way). If you have any vaguely credible studies which support this, I'd love to see them.

Note the caveat ""for a similar output"". If we are talking about small farms as a replacement for industrial farming, they will need to cover more land to make up the loss in land space efficiency. Similar losses in other forms of efficiency will have an environmental impact.

One battery chicken farm has a smaller land footprint than the same number of chickens spread out in a free range farm, for example.

&gt; Obesity is one such measure, diabetes is another. Yes, diseases of malnutrition are just as pernicious as diseases of abundance, but what we have are diseases of abundant poor quality food.

Diseases of abundance come from abundance, if you're claim that similar abundance can be reached with another form of farming then we will not see a reduction in these diseases from those methods. If the claim is that it will reduce abundance that contradicts your earlier claims, and it seems then that your solution to the diseases of abundance is starvation for vast swathes of humanity.",0,1342940671,null,0,false,0,c5hkoz7,t3_wx109,t1_c5hkoz7,t1_c5h92z9,null,1429438008,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

OK.  As I said, the scientific literature is thin on the ground for a number of reasons (not least because permaculture is focused on ecological sustainability and food productivity, rather than reducing labour costs and increasing profits).  But here are a few articles:

http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es051670d

I appreciate [this one](http://www.whale.to/a/blume.html) is pure anecdote, but it is from a scientist.

[Here's another](http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_3659.cfm), with more conservative estimates, but still exceeding those of modern monoculture.

&gt;If we are talking about small farms as a replacement for industrial farming, they will need to cover more land to make up the loss in land space efficiency. Similar losses in other forms of efficiency will have an environmental impact.

This is all dealt with above.

&gt;Diseases of abundance come from abundance.

Not necessarily.  The old debate between fat and sugar has surfaced again recently, and this time it's looking much more likely that [sugar is the villain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM).  Monoculture and industrial scale farming (with the associated system of subsidies) have been partly responsible for the massive increases in our sugar (and sugar-substitute/corn syrup) intake, and all the associated harm.  Low fat foods tend to have higher sugar content, etc.  Permaculture obviously concentrates on diversity (if that isn't an oxymoron!), and although organic food isn't intrinsically ""better"", the general lifestyle it promotes is healthier (lower fat, lower sugar, higher fibre,etc.)",0,1342943760,null,0,false,0,c5hl48n,t3_wx109,t1_c5hl48n,t1_c5hkoz7,null,1429438210,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The problem is that the main advantage of the House of Lords is that they actually read the legislation that is being passed. If you have short term jury service, people won't have the expertise or patience to do that. Or really the general knowledge to spot problems- for instance constitutional issues, or potential problems in implementation. Jury service is a great idea, but it only works because the judge, attorneys and barristers all know what they're talking about, and can direct how the court runs. 

I wouldn't use the idea in the Lords, but I would be inclined to use it elsewhere. For instance, you could have a jury sitting in the Leveson enquiry, to scrutinize whether the final report accurately represents the evidence which was heard, to prevent a political fudge. Or, one of the Scandinavian countries uses a similar idea instead of referendums. Where there's a complicated issue that requires direct public input, they set up a randomly chosen  constituent assembly, the various cases are presented publicly over a period of weeks, and the vote of the assembly is taken as the will of the public.

To claim that a Brit putting money into a tax haven deprives African governments of the money to end poverty is insane. Even if all the money washed back into Western governments and was taxed, it would no nothing for African poverty.

The key issue though is that tax avoidance does not destroy the trickle down effect as it is commonly understood.

That money doesn't sit in an Antiguan bank account and fester, it is invested. Those investments can't be in Antigua, they have to be around the world, and thus they create jobs and wealth around the world though the normal processes of commerce.

You can argue that the profits not being taxed deprives the government of funds, but those same untaxed profits are reinvested back into companies to create more jobs and more wealth - and obviously, more profits.

The question then is whether people are better off due to the effects of that untaxed investment, or if they would be better off through handouts due to higher taxes?

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"I'm an engineer so I like to keep to the golden rule ""keep it simple"" . And also , as an engineer , I like to look below the hood and explore all the various approaches . As such the proposal , in brief , would be :-

**The Legislative Assembly** - the House of Commons

elected on a simple nationwide PR basis . Each elector having 4 votes . Idea being - for example - they could vote for - i) for their trade \ profession , ii) for their beliefs , iii) for someone special - a person of note , iv) for their politics .

There would be 1 representative per 250,000 people . 2011 census gives our population at 63,162,000 people so that would give 252 representatives .

The total number of votes cast divided by the number of representatives would give the number of votes per person ( NOVPP ) . The minimum number of votes required would be the number of votes per person minus a margin - eg. NOVPP x ( 1 - 1/252 ) . Any votes in excess of NOVPP would be redistributable by the candidate as they saw fit . Likewise where any candidate fails to win enough votes they would be able to redistribute the votes as they saw fit.

A term of 3 years . Elections for 1/3rd. every year . Representatives who have failed to be elected but who have ongoing business would be able to be kept on for a further year as a special advisor . This keeps things fluid and it also encourages legislation to be produced that is generally acceptable .

**The House of Review** - the House of Lords

elected on a per constituency AV basis . The electors would cast their votes by either indicating in order of preference or by indicating a single candidate and , hence , using the candidate's order of preference . There would be 1 representative per 250,000 people .

The House of Review is essentially where the politics would be . The House of Review would represent the interests of the individual electorates and the constituents of those electorates .

A term of 3 years . Elections for 1/3rd. every year . Representatives who have failed to be elected but who have ongoing business would be able to be kept on for a further year as a special advisor . This keeps things fluid and it also encourages legislation to be produced that is generally acceptable .

**The Operation**

The Executive would be elected out of The Legislative Assembly and the The House of Review - the Parliamentary System would be used .

The Legislative Assembly would originate all legislation and associated regulation . The House of Review would pass \ not pass the proposed legislation . It could send the proposed legislation back for reconsideration . It could also pass existing legislation back for reconsideration .

Lobbying of all types would not be allowed . All interests in society would be represented by bodies - eg. trade bodies , chambers of commerce , church bodies etc. . The government would consult with these .

PS: The House of Review would also be responsible for clarifying interpretation of the law .

Sounds pretty bloody reasonable to me - frivolous court action wastes the tax payer's money and ties up the judiciary.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; Yeah, but it wasn't with the intention of buying players to win a title

The line of credit was for exactly that. 

NESV is the first time we have had little debt in 20+ years. H&amp;G bought a club heavily in debt and loaded it with more.

A bit of history.

We had Â£45M in debt when H&amp;G bought the club. At the time where revenue was a fraction of what it is today, this was high.

H&amp;G took out a loan of Â£175M against the club in order to purchase it. They said they wouldn't do this, but they did. The Â£20M cash deposit they used ended up being borrowed as well, but from other sources (we found this out when the club went into administration).

They then took out another line of credit of Â£113M to invest into the club and to begin the new stadium.

Both of these loans were at a very high interest rate, around 9% for one and 13-14% for the other (off the top of my head).

So we had both types of bad debt, the leveraged buyout, and then the stupid expensive line of credit to improve the team.

In contrast Arsenals debt is a 4.5% p.a 30 year bond. They got their stadium built, and their interest payments are not crippling the club. So not all debt is equal.

What happen at Liverpool is worse than what happen at the other clubs, because we leveraged the club up in order to improve revenue through both a new stadium and through onfield success and achieved neither.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;One of the most extraordinarily badly written articles I have seen from the Guardian in a long time.

This only proves you don't read the Guardian very often.

&gt;To claim that a Brit putting money into a tax haven deprives African governments of the money to end poverty is insane. Even if all the money washed back into Western governments and was taxed, it would no nothing for African poverty.

What about this: [http://www.dfid.gov.uk/](http://www.dfid.gov.uk/)

&gt;That money doesn't sit in an Antiguan bank account and fester, it is invested. Those investments can't be in Antigua, they have to be around the world, and thus they create jobs and wealth around the world though the normal processes of commerce.

""around the world"" being the key point in this. These ""normal process of commerce"" you're referring to is a globalised one where the slave or working class do the menial jobs. The trickle down effect relies on all classes of people being in the same society, which they aren't. When the money from major manufacturing companies trickles down to cheap Chinese or SE Asian workers is skews the process.

&gt;those same untaxed profits are reinvested back into companies to create more jobs and more wealth - and obviously, more profits.

Can you actually prove any of this? I mean, even if the money was retained within a single countries economy there is no evidence to suggest that the wealth goes anywhere near the poor as far as I'm aware. The problem is profit, when people are striving to make more profit that's where the excess money goes, not to the poor.

&gt;The question then is whether people are better off due to the effects of that untaxed investment, or if they would be better off through handouts due to higher taxes?

Good question, I'm not sold on the idea of aid as a long term solution but that doesn't mean that rich countries investing in Africa in the methods they're currently employing are the answer either.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This idea of having a House of Experts is pretty common in debates about reform of the Lords, and I don't think it has much validity for a few reasons. 

Firstly, why should someone who has been selected based on specialist knowledge alone be able to vote on issues outwith their particular field? If we're going to have scientists in because they understand the lastest developments in their area, why exactly should their voice be taken seriously on issues like fox hunting?

Secondly, there will be selection bias. The leading expert in drugs research in the UK at the moment is David Nutt. He will never be allowed to be a member of a House of Experts for the same reason that  he was sacked from his role on the advisory board for the misuse of drugs. He favours policies which are vastly different to the current settlement and are not politically convenient. 

As is common at the moment, those most highly regarded in their field, are very often those who most closely articulate the mainstream conservative view. Those regarded as Constitutional Experts almost always consider the constitution as already perfect and unable to be improved. The most highly rated Economists, even until the day before the crash, considered the neo-liberal settlement to be the perfect economic model. A house filled with these people would be an excellent hurdle to any significant or meaningful reform or anything whatsoever.

Thirdly, experts aren't under represented in the political process. Almost by definition these are people whose opinion is listened to. This reform would be fixing a problem that not only doesn't exist but could never really exist. If we are going to have a reform of the Lords I think it should be to solve the major problem with the British constitution. 

That problem is that most peoples votes don't matter and that most people are not represented by someone that they support. 2/3 Constituencies have an MP that the majority of voters did not vote for. Furthermore there votes that parties attract has almost nothing to do with the power they wield in Parliament; a party that got 40,000 votes holds more sway than a party that got 920,000 votes. 

The answer is a proportionally elected house. The reason that the Tories and Labour are resistant to this, is that they are the ONLY parties that benefit from the current settlement, being over represented in both the Commons and the Lords. The 'primacy of the Commons' argument reflects this. If there was a fairly elected second chamber, it would undermine the Commons by (just like the Scottish Parliament, NI Assembly, Welsh Assembly and GLA) better representing the public than the Commons does.

At least if the Government distribute wealth back it can make sure it is spent in places where it is most needed and in a way that backs human rights.

The best example would be to look at when the Government cut back on subsidising the renewable energy sector meaning that we no longer produced solar panels and instead they are produced in other countries where they have less concern about whether the working conditions are safe and the workers are paid decent wages and pensions and so on.

There has been change from 1998, but perhaps the diagram in that post doesn't show it well enough for you. [Here is graph which clearly shows warming after 1998, up to 2005](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/figure-3-1.html). By 2013/2014 the IPCC will have released their fifth assesment, which will no doubt show more (and increased?) warming past 2005. 

This is not some propaganda conspiracy thought up by a few people to wreck the economy. The banks do a good enough job of that already. There are thousands of scientists all around the world that reach the same results. Saying this is just propaganda is crazy, past the level of arguing that the moon landings didn't happen, or that 9/11 was orchestrated by the US. 

I'd like to see the sources and science behind your argument that there is no warming. Even those scientists who still search for natural reasons for climate change generally acknowledge that there is rapid warming.

And by the way, I think it's a fucked up thinking, to say, that women are just having different choices. Why do they have different choices? Why do women always end up doing jobs, men are not very likely to do? 

This video is liberal bullshit. It encourage us to say, well, see women decide for their own, altough in reality, our society plays a way bigger role. We still think to certain part, that the man works and the women stays at home and looks after the children. That is what we think in our society, a family should look like this and that has a big influence on decisions people will do.

And that is why women do not aim for their highest goal, but for those that give social approvement like becoming a nurse or stewardess. This is still a big discrimination.

Altough I want to give the video some recognition.

|These choices could be the result of personal preferences or sexist cultural expectations for women's work, though the relative influence of these two factors remains unclear.

This was in the subtext of the video and should show the dilemna. Unfortunately the professor doesn't see, what a big problem this poses, when an average women has child and what that does mean for a carreer.

It's so much bull-shit and it shocks me that this man is a professor (well, with money, people say anything!) and he shows you a graph with a male person having a wonderful career and the women poping one children after the other out and then saying, nah you see, no discrimination. It fucking is discrimination. Try having children and work at the same time, that is nearly fucking impossible, if you do not have the money for a nurse. It's very sexiest to say, that women who have children have made their choice and should deal with it. A man doesn't have the problem. Having a child is a decision where the women always lose because the men aren't doing a damn thing to change this inequality.

Measuring how small scale farms in poor countries, by adopting the modern farming methods the rich nations have developed, increased productivity and reduced pollution and resource destruction.

Doesn't help your case.

The other two, I'm inclined to reject the second out of hand, the third, eh. I would prefer something more scholarly. They seem to be testing a model that is entirely unsuitable to large scale farming. i.e. one that can only be dealt with directly by hand, which will mean massively increased costs due to labour wages.

Adam has had one good season with a relegation side.

Lucas did the job of two men, when partnered with Adam. Once he was injured, our form dropped tremendously because we had such a weak midfield. One of the biggest factors in wanting to replace/trade him is that his style of play is not suited to a tiki-taka pass and move system. He is slow, and loves long high risk passes.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Measuring how small scale farms in poor countries, by adopting the modern farming methods the rich nations have developed, increased productivity and reduced pollution and resource destruction.

You're cherry picking.  It's about small-scale ecologically sustainable farming using modern, but ""low-cost and locally available technologies and inputs"" as opposed to industrial monoculture.

&gt;I'm inclined to reject the second out of hand

On what grounds?  I accept it's basically anecdotal rather than scientific of course, but can it be discounted and rejected out of hand merely for that?  Or do you just find the productivity gains he sets out too good to be true?  If they are true of course, this suggests the potential for permaculture to outperform monoculture in terms of productivity is substantial.  Maybe some proper trials would be worthwhile?  And there are currently moves towards this end.

&gt;which will mean massively increased costs due to labour wages.

The actual labour inputs to permaculture, once established, are actually quite minimal in terms of hours worked, because the whole thrust of it is to establish [guilds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#Guilds) which are largely self-reinforcing and work with nature rather than against it as with traditional farming.  But, yes, the thinking is always small scale, because that's part of the philosophy, but it doesn't necessarily mean it can't be extensively replicated.  It would also clearly involve a larger proportion of the world's population going ""back to the land"", but that's not necessarily unattractive for many people - especially in an era in which it is becoming increasingly clear that industrial production cannot provide the mass employment it once did, nor are finance and services industries necessarily long term options, but nor does it mean a life of grinding poverty as existed in pre-industrial agricultural societies.  If th promise it shows is borne out, it could very much feed _a_ world, with a large population, but probably not of exactly the type which we have now.  It is partly going to depend on how far you believe our current model is sustainable long term?  Incidentally, permaculture experiments are becoming quite widespread in the UK, but it will undoubtedly entail, for example, significant reforestation.

&gt;Do you honestly imagine that should there be fewer potatoes or corn around, but more of other vegetables in equal calorie proportion to the losses, that we as a nation would lose weight? I think it far more likely we would eat as much, but of different things.

Obviously, calorific intake is the major contributor to weight gain, but it's clearly easier to become fat and unhealthy on some foods as opposed to others.  And there's also the issue of fibre.  Eat fibre with your sugar (or even with your beer!) and the damage to your body and your liver is substantially reduced.  Eating as much but of different things, so long as there was a diversity (as opposed to the massive over-consumption of corn-based, over-produced, and refined starch/carbohydrate-based products), and I can't see _but_ that it would be a substantial dietary improvement.

Edit:  Incidentally, just by the by.  The US House of Representatives Agricultural Committee has just sneaked through a Farm Bill with a decades' worth of subsidies for large industrial monocultural farming of corn, wheat, soybeans, sugar etc. amounting to around a trillion dollars, at the same time as cutting food stamp subsidies by sixteen billion.

true,waydee,null,null,"I'm in no way anti metric but I really don't see this as an problem in the UK, I'm yet to encounter a situation in every day life where the unit of measurement used caused an issue.

Engineering and the sciences operate in metric as they should to avoid any cross culture mixups and for simplicity of calculation, whereas a carpet fitter should be just as able to provide and fit a carpet regardless of if you ask for it in feet or metres.  I can cook my food whether a recipe specifies lbs and ounces or kilograms and grams.

When in countries where they deal exclusively in metric it's not an issue to know that a kilometre is less than a mile and a half litre of beer is a bit less than a pint.  Much of what we buy in the UK is either in nice easy round metric values or the equivalent metric value of an imperial measurement (note the amount of food that comes in 454g containers for example)

I appreciate that it's a bit of a hodge podge of units and our neighbours consider us terribly backwards for using both systems but don't consider it that important to ditch a system that people are comfortable with using.  That will no doubt change in time but there's no harm in burning fuel by the gallon and buying it by the litre for me at least.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"There is a basic flaw here that is not being addressed. In my opinion global free trade is manifestly a good thing- all sorts of consumer and industrial products are better and cheaper now than they have ever been, and not just because technology marches forward. I don't think anyone seriously thinks we should be trying to restrict the import of products made abroad. Are we going to charge more to buy an American mobile phone App than a British one? How do we make sense of a smartphone running American software, built by a Taiwanese company in China, using British chip designs? That world is gone, and we shouldn't mourn its passing.

But there are clearly drawbacks, and the most important of these is the race to the bottom that occurs through taxation rates. Ireland has attracted a lot of the English speaking companies looking to operate in Europe, by cutting its corporation tax to around 10%. It might be wise for us to try to outcompete them on that basis, but it's clear that this dynamic is a nonsense in the long term. Economies rely on communal investment, in education, roads, rail, internet, basic science funding, and so on, and none of us want to live in a world where the poor die on the streets, or for lack of decent medical care, as they once did.

The only solution, it seems to me, is some sort of international agreement. That the major world economies club together, and say that free trade and movement of capital only occurs on the basis of meeting certain preset criteria- that tax rates are not too low, financial transactions are transparent, and still subject to the relevant taxation, perhaps that there are basic worker rights, and basic care of the environment, and so on. But such an agreement hardly looks like it is on the cards. For one thing, even the relatively internationalist people on reddit would probably object on the basis of sovereignty and libertarianism. If that's the case, good luck getting the average Chinese citizen on board.

I am not judging Charlie Adam based solely on statistics, but it is helpful to have a quantifiable way in judging two players. Yes, this overlooks huge portions of the players game , and can lead to inconclusive results, but in a team struggling to find and create goals last season, Adam seems like more of a solution than Aquilani, who is more similar to Jordan Henderson.

The real question is how Charlie will be employed by Rodgers, if at all. I don't see a future for him at the club, but that is not to say he is the rubbish player that many are making him out to be.

Starting life as three weavers' cottages built circa 1460 The Hoop was converted to an Ale House approximately 450 years ago. There are several possible explanations why the ale house was named ""The Hoop"", the most common being the hoops used by a cooper in the manufacture of barrels.

Another being the raised hoops that would encircle a quart pot. In bygone times an overflowing tankard was said to be ""cock-a-hoop"" and the expression has since come to denote merry-making and drinking without stint. A tradition the locals still boast!

The present-day Hoop is notable for its handsome brick fireplaces. The bar is ornamented throughout by the buildingâs original timber framework, most of which formed part of warships lying in dock at Tilbury.

It was the practice in those days for the beams to be transported from the coast on wagons, after which the drivers would load their vehicles with newly-cut forest timber and take it back to Tilbury.""",0,1342975476,null,0,false,0,c5hore1,t3_wyoqw,t1_c5hore1,t3_wyoqw,null,1429440001,3,false,Essex,t5_2ship,3

The reservoir itself is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the important numbers of wildfowl that use the reservoir in the autumn and winter, including Gladwell, Tufted Duck and Pochard.  The spectacle of thousands of Swifts, Swallows and Martins feeding over the water during peak fly hatches is one of the delights for the summer visitor. 30 acres of the woodland are ancient in origin and spring flowers include carpets of Bluebells and Stitchwort.""",0,1342975748,null,0,false,0,c5hotfz,t3_wyoqw,t1_c5hotfz,t1_c5hore1,null,1429440030,3,false,Essex,t5_2ship,3

true,BoltenMoron,num11,,"I phrased that last paragraph incorrectly. I shouldn't have implied causation on Madrid's behalf as there is no evidence they directly or indirectly coerced Modric into acting the way he has. What Spurs did with Jan was to rely on his diminishing value due to his short contract. What Madrid are doing is actively utilizing Modric's own negative actions as a tool to reduce the cost. 

It is a form of indirect collusion between the parties. Madrid know they don't need to encourage Modric to act this way. They can rely on this as he did it last year with Chelsea. Madrid would have known that by demonstrating intense interest they would have unsettled Modric causing him to breach his contract. Even though it is indirect, Madrid have caused Modric to act this way and would have known Modric would have attempted to force his price down by acting up. Actively using misconduct to further your bargaining position is still negotiating in poor faith especially if you knew that misconduct was going to take place.

That's a straw man, but I'll still bite - at what point does a person *have* to ""steal something""? Are you really saying that this chap had no option but to steal? He couldn't stand to one side?

&gt; Responsibility is shared but in criminal law, if the mind and the act aren't as one we don't convict.

He had the requisite MR and AR for theft. They coincided. Not even the defence argued otherwise - this article is just his mother claiming that the police were at fault. You seem to be arguing that he was acting under duress of circumstances - you couldn't raise that without being laughed out of court.

Pirlo may have only two years left, though, and no one in the Italian media would claim that Aquilani has been anything more than average. He's not the sought after player that this subreddit pretends he is. If he was good value for the money, someone would have bought him. 

Read the comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/ti0au/question_from_a_liverpool_fan_how_has_alberto/) from AC Milan supporters. He was inconsistent and unimpressive for the second half of the season. If our aspirations are to develop into a CL side, Aquilani will probably not be the player who takes us there.

So say you work Saturday and Sunday, but get Weds and Thursday off instead. That's now your weekend. Does it matter? Why would it? Now Sunday is a normal day when everything opens, so why would it matter if Sunday is your day off or not - it would be indistinguishable from any other day for you.

Of course if you have a particular reason that you can't work on specific days (eg. you go to church on Sunday, your kids are at home all day on Sat/Sun, or say you need to go for a regular hospital visit every Wednesday, etc.) then you would obviously specify that when you start your contract or even just let your employer know at the point where it will suddenly be an issue - as people already do! I've had jobs where I haven't work on weekdays specified by me before, even shitty low paid jobs that people consider almost bereft of rights... the thing is that you get paid for the time you work so which 5 days you work don't really matter to your employer. As long as you are not just working 1 day a week or something it makes no difference to the employer which days you work because they'll need the same amount of staff to cover all opening hours regardless. The trouble people have is when they need more staff trained up to do the job because everyone's hours are so short, or when they are short on staff and start calling you to work on your days off - *however* that is due to bad management and happens *anyway*.

That's completely irrelevant. Theft was not a reasonable nor foreseeable consequence of his obstruction. He acted of his own volition. ""Made a victim""? Wow.

&gt; He didn't have the requisite MR and AR for theft

I'm sorry, but yes, he did. He admitted he intended to steal. He admitted stealing. You can argue philosophical points until the cows come home, but as far as the law is concerned he was guilty.

&gt; I'm assuming you know that even our own Lord Justices have publicly criticised what happened in courts up and down the country. The idea seemed to me to be to get everyone in a cell before they could reasonably test their cases before fresh and impartial minds.

They criticised the sentencing, yes - and, frankly, I agree with them. It was overly harsh in many cases - but that's not the same as an incorrect verdict. 

&gt; And this isn't court, you can't prescribe the rules as you know them. If you'd like to moot go back to law school, they patronise each other all the time. 

Pardon me? You said ""in criminal law, if the mind and the act aren't as one we don't convict"" - that's patronising as hell.

If you want to argue about law, let's argue about law - but don't conflate it with pseudo-philisophy and strawmans. Not only is that a poor way of winning an argument, it is also disrespectful to the person you are arguing with.

As I said in my OP, I wasn't passing comment about the correctness of imprisoning first-time offenders - but this kid was guilty and he admitted he was guilty. It was not the fault of the police any more than it would be yours if you took the last slice of cake from a bakery and the customer next-in-line stabbed the baker.

true,Annix,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; The circumstances are not irrelevant. They're so significant that had they not been as they were, and had they not been as extreme, none of it would have happened. If you can remove the Mind from the events surrounding and find that act would not have occurred then you can fairly say that the Mind did not alone cause the Act.

And yet none of that excuses what he did. Under the same logic any person could claim a partial defence based upon the run up of events leading to the prohibited conduct. ""Sorry m'lud, I'm not completely guilty because in the morning someone double parked and it caused me to run late. That's why I was speeding, and that's why I ran a red light, clipping the pedestrian"".

&gt; And I can philosophise, I can be opinionated, I have done so. And I'm entitled to be so. And your argument that I can't, wow. Fuck you, really, what exactly do you think you're doing?

Indeed, well done. Of course, it makes you sound like you are ranting rather than presenting a reasoned argument, but go ahead. My objection comes because I don't deal with rants - I find you can't engage with a person who doesn't consider the other's points, and who adapts their position when they feel they are losing. For example, you never responded to my challenge over your straw man - you just ignored it, and moved on. 

I can't have a reasoned debate with a person like that, and if you wish to continue then you will have to stop the philosophical crap and engage the discussion properly. It's my ball, and I'm not playing on a pitch that changes shape and size. Don't like it? Fine by me - I'm getting bored with repeating myself.

&gt; I believe it was lady Hamilton who first spoke out about the lengths at which the state had gone to to make sure the hearings could take place so swiftly that it appeared to her to be a policy designed to lock people up without a fair hearing. Such as it is I believe no one of those convictions can be relied on, that isn't to say some wouldn't have been convicted in a fair hearing, but to say that those hearings were not conducted in accordance with the best interests of Justice.

Excuse my ignorance, but Lady who?

&gt; Our duty counsel system was broken enough before we handed some counsel 10 files and told them that they had to make it appear as if everyone had competent effective counsel so they could lock everyone up. And the Judges, they were mentally compromised by the media before they become jaded by the constant flow of cases before them.

Oh come on, our judiciary is a little more cynical than to rise and fall with every ebb and flow of the gutter press. Combined with the right to appeal, I don't think this is a problem - same with lacking adequate representation. Again, I've not heard of this being an issue, but I'd be happy to concede if you can show me some sources.

&gt; This kid probably didn't realise what was happening and still doesn't realise what has happened. If guilty is to be seen as nothing but a label then we're all of guilty automatically upon being accused for none of us can honestly claim to know what we're accused of and therefore know that we didn't do it. But if Guilt is to have significance in society then it must only be metered out to those definitively deserve it and anyone who could be innocent, under the circumstances, should be considered innocent.

What does this even mean?

&gt; You think that just meeting the letter of the law is enough, the spirit of the law compels Justices, lay or professional, to consider all the things that could be relevant and to release anyone who is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Yes, that's the criminal standard, which happens to be the letter of the law. ""All the things that could be relevant"" are matters for sentencing, not for deciding whether the law has been broken. Again, where the judiciary has erred, the appeals circuit awaits. I would love to see the statistics on appeals from last year - I'd wager they're not a great deal higher than any other, as a percentage of sentences. 

&gt; Solicitors often learn the hard lesson, the Justice is always right, even if a room for of practising solicitors disagree the Justice can tell them to go fuck em selves and dismiss the case because they see it's not in the interest of the society to convict a child for an offence committed under exceptional circumstances were had those circumstances not occurred the offence would never have happened. They can do that, that they chose not to worries me, political sentencing following political convictions isn't Justice.

It's not a political conviction when the person committed a crime. I'm sorry, but you keep coming back to this and I can only repeat myself so many times. These people stole. They robbed. They burgled. In some cases, they committed arson. All of these crimes had victims. You can argue that they were expressing frustration at class suppression, or the economic policies of the Tories going back 30 years were an inevitable cause of something like this, but that has no influence upon the fact that they broke a law. The punishment was in many cases politically influenced, and I agree that is an outrage - but to say that people were *convicted* because of political pressure? No. In each case the evidence is presented for all to see, and there is a right to appeal. In the vast majority of cases the convictions were sound. Objections from the senior bench came from circumstances surrounding the sentencing and not the convictions themselves.",0,1342989528,null,0,false,0,c5hrvof,t3_wygm7,t1_c5hrvof,t1_c5hrd74,null,1429441466,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sure, people may be new, and may just be getting into the series, but the same could then be said for older, classic Doctor episodes, but I wouldn't put a spoiler tag on something cool from some Tom Baker serial.

I think the ""current series and upcoming episodes"" rule is a great one. As somebody in Canada, I don't often get caught up on episodes until later, so knowing which threads contain spoilers from the current season is very helpful around here.

I also think that around here (like in most subreddits) if you're going to have a rule like this, there should be a very straightforward and consistent consequence: post deletion. **Any** post that violates the rule should be deleted as soon as it is found, without exception.

But how to do this? 

One of the central reasons employers have cut hours back is because of rising overheads and falling profits. This will, in time sort itself out as the economy begins to recover, and people start spending more. The rise in overheads needs to be tackled and examined closely to see where the government can do something about it. 

Some employers, of course, are employing lots of people part time rather than employing the correct number full time, in order to get around tax bills. 

We may also need to look at the Minimum Wage. Maybe a complete freeze on it is in order until at least 2015?  

If we combine this with legislation to ensure that council and HA rents do not rise until the same time, pressure can then be mounted on the private landlords to keep their rents low.

 - multiple children
 - no genuine desire to have more children
 - an inability to control their fertility
 - a proven record of child abuse/neglect
 - substance abuse

to get sterilised/long term contraception?  I would argue that it is *compassionate*: for them, for their existing children, and for potential future children that would either end up neglected or in care, neither of which are great options.

I think you're also under the delusion that this is about ""poor people"".  It's not necessarily. There are rich child neglecting junkies from higher sociodemographic backgrounds that I would advocate this approach with as well.

Finally I suspect you're under the white knight delusion that you're ""happy"" to fund this, as though a few of your tax dollars are the only price.  Actually, you're not the victim of these problem people, a few of your tax dollars apart.

The victims of these people are *other poor people* who are forced to have them as neighbours, to suffer their antisocial behaviour, to have their own children's education wrecked by their presence in schools.  You, I suspect, live nowhere near any of these people.  And if you did I suspect you would move.

I couldn't give a shit if ""poor"" or rich people have 20 or more children, *if they and their children do not actively cause harm and detriment to other people and their children*.  And also I resent that people who abuse and neglect children are allowed to have further children *before they have managed to sort out their situation*.

Now take your sad, middle class little guilt white knight complex, and go and open your eyes.  And *actually read* what I've written.  And actually go and read what the Nazis actually did.

I agree that there are current problems with unemployment.  But what is mainly to blame is not having a system that matches migrant numbers with employment demand (such as Australia has).  The EU complicates such a system because original and earlier members were given the right to live and work freely in other states.  Clearly, it wasn't considered (or it was - but such views were condemned as ""Eurosceptic"") that there might be an eventual imbalance in terms of who wanted to live and work where.

Better enforcing of minimum wages would be a partial remedy.  But also recognising that labour does have a cost, which fluctuates.  There are industries we no longer have or won't have in the UK for the foreseeable future because of the cost of living and the availability of cheaper labour overseas.  One day this may shift, likely not for decades though.  Migrant workers who do a job cheaply and remit the money overseas have been a phenomenon since time began.

true,lokithecomplex,uk,Edinburgh,"&gt; The problem is the manipulation of the interest rates.

That's a problem, but one of many. And we don't really know how to fix it. And we certainly can't get  every financial centre to agree on its approximate answer.

&gt; The boom-bust cycle caused by interest rate manipulation is incredibly wasteful, and is exasperated by governments attempts to 'save' countries/banks with bailouts and loan guarantees.

The cycle exists without the interest rate manipulations.

&gt; More regulation is not the answer, the answer, unfortunately, is to stop bailing out banks with tax revenues. Only when banks are made completely accountable for the risks that they take, will they lend responsibly.

You can have your perfect banking system all you like but as long your banks are connected to the unregulated world markets they can find all the cheap, funny money they like.

The banks will always be able to eventually find a way round sensible regulation and destroy themselves. We can sublimate I guess. But the more we push for globalized unregulated markets the more we can expect these bubbles and crashes.

Besides you have the order the wrong way round. Are you really suggesting that when the dealers who were buying and selling the collateralized debt obligations based on sub prime were expecting the state to bail out the banks?

Sure now the banks are operating with moral hazard but not before.

I guess at this point you will tell me the banks should have been allowed to crash so that we could all be living with tremendous growth now. I think that's wishful thinking that dodges the reality that an economic depression would have been spread over millions of people that had nothing to do with skimming percentages off CDO trades. That depression would not be like the reset button on a video game.

Sure once we have created an economic year zero banks will operate in a prudent and conservative manner.

I don't mind walking down into the town to pick a package up, but this one time I got a card that said it was left at the one closest, although I had to leave 24 hours to go pick it up.  So I head down the next day to get it, and the fella tells me that they don't have it and that it was probably left at the other one.  I couldn't get down to the other one until the next day, but when I went down, they told me that they didn't have it either and that it must be at the one closest to me and the postman just forgot to drop it off so I should head back up to see.

And I did.  And they still didn't have it, but they gave me a number to call to find out what had happened to it.  The man on the phone said he'd try and find it, and get back to me.
Never got called back.

I waited for a couple of weeks (with a little back and forth with the HQ in Belfast), and was just about to report the package as missing, when it turned up.
Through the letterbox.
It was a book, and it fit, and I didn't have to sign for it or anything.

true,mungosabe,flair3,,"&gt;It was definitely more than a couple of games, and seeing as they were spread out over, what, four years, I'd say comparing them to a good two-week tournament performance is pretty off.

That was in response to your comment about his EL performance against United. I didn't watch any Ajax CL games from 2009-2011 so I cannot single out any of his personal performances, but Ajax results in the CL during the past few years have not been spectacular. If you watched those games and are telling me that Vertonghen was the exception, then I guess I have to believe you. Besides, I'm not saying Vertonghen isn't worth 9m--that's clearly what he was worth to Ajax under the circumstances or they never would have accepted.


&gt;It doesn't really matter if you think Cahill was overpriced, his deal set something of market price for his sort of player. There's no such thing as an objective price for a player, prices are set by how much the buying and selling clubs want the player and the level of comparable recent transactions. Personally I don't think he was that overpriced, I expected 5m.

Yes, exactly. It does not matter what we think at all. Further, we aren't privy to a lot of information that Levy probably is, so for us to say RM is the only suitor or that Modric should/shouldn't be sold for 27m is difficult to justify. Fair play to Madrid, I don't blame them for trying to pay less for a player, but that doesn't mean we have to accept any offer they give us because we won't sell to our direct rivals. I'm going to have to stick by Levy on this one as he also seems to think that Modric is worth more than 27m to us.

&gt;Cahill was hardly proven. He'd played maybe two good years with Bolton, and had no experience whatsoever of playing at a higher level.

Cahill played 130 games for Bolton in the EPL.  55 in the last two years before he was sold (more if he hadn't gone to Chelsea mid-season) and he was clearly their best defender. Sorry, but that's proven. The EPL isn't the CL, sure, but it's still an incredibly high level to be proven at.

Michael Essien looks like he's on the mend, looked comfortable at the back.

Mceachran struggled when he came on, and without JT or Ivan, there's no structure at the back ( might be because Cahill and Luiz like to make forward runs).

Marin was excellent again, and Hazard is going to be phenomenal this season i reckon.

Lukaku needs to get more experience, and to be honest, i hope Sturridge gets a chance as a striker this season, he has the potential to be good enough in my eyes.

OH and Ashley Cole is about 3000 times better than Paulo Ferreira, he smashed the left wing as soon as he came on, definitely changed the game.

1. Stamina to get through mid-winter schedule: The obvious one I guess. When there are games every 3 days, the season can be blown away by having one striker injured and another off-form. The effect Tevez had when he came back to add depth to striking force would speak for itself. Having Dzeko even as a fourth striker adds so much more insurance, the type of insurance that City should aim for and can afford.
2. Tactical depth: With Dzeko's presence, City can afford to have a Plan B that is substantially different from Plan A when it comes to attack. His aerial threat cannot be replicated easily by Aguero and Tevez, and his poaching inside the box allows City to dump the ball towards the net and hope for the best (as crude as it sounds). Albeit not elegant, this is the type of Plan B that a championship team needs, and we can contrast Barcelona's struggle in the Chelsea leg with City's eventual win against QPR where that very Dzeko scored the tying header off a corner after 15+ attempts.",0,1343022194,null,0,false,0,c5hzg76,t3_ww0yd,t1_c5hzg76,t1_c5hql42,null,1429445111,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

That sounds good.  I like the idea of a companion with a backstory, especially since we haven't really had that so far (at least in the new series).  It seems like something Steven Moffat would do, also.

&gt;(what they said about her being cast because she could talk faster than Smith is an interesting note)

I can think of several reasons they might want this, and not a single one of them wouldn't be hilarious.  I am all for a companion who can out-talk the Doctor, that sounds incredibly entertaining.

&gt;Have you seen the classic series? Sarah Jane is wonderful and really the breakthrough companion, and Romana is a Time Lady and acts almost like the Doctor's sister. They both are among my favorites.

I haven't, I just caught up with the 2005 series.  I'm planning to go check out the classics at some point, but it's a bit intimidating because there's just so many of them.

true,Rynoh,null,null,"My thoughts

1.  Only having 1 true striker in camp is hurting the end product quite a bit.  Lukaku did alright with his positioning but didn't anticipate to well and with his slow first step and poor first touch that is a problem.  At 19 he should develop and is an exciting prospect but he isn't ready to be depended upon this year.  Our offense lacks a focal point in the attack and we have no one for Marin, Hazard, Rami to play off of.

2.  Malouda isn't dead.  He seems to fair much better in this type of a team.  Maybe Malouda wasn't as worthless as we all thought and it had more to do with the lack of players aroudn him?  Then again Maybe it had to do with the fact he was playing against the 2nd teamers when he came on.

3.  I found it very strange that Mikel was the one getting forward when he was paired with Essien in the double pivot to start the 2nd half.  He didn't do to much going forward but he was further up field then normal.  Looks like Essien has a legitimate shot at taking his DM spot from him though.

4.  The announcers on FSC were right in 1 reguard.  We need to get more people into the box.  We would have a striker and usually the opposite winger in the box but the 2 pivot players and the CAM were never in the box when crosses came in.  We need to do a better job getting numbers forward.  Last game I thought we weren't getting them because Hazard/Marin were getting up field so fast on the counter that Rami was the only one who could keep up but this game it had more to do with the CAM playing so deep not to mention they are tiny.",0,1343039414,null,0,false,0,c5i1pyf,t3_wzvqy,t1_c5i1pyf,t3_wzvqy,null,1429446244,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Have you got figures for this? I can't find any. Been looking for ages. The finances of the Olympics are far from complete, and won't be until after, so unless you wait till after, any arguments made on this basis will be purely speculation.

I'll give you the point about the tickets. I never said the games were perfect.

&gt;they get given more than a third of the tickets totally free

Have you got a source for that as well?

I do understand the reasons. But a lot of them are exaggerated or made up. Some people are just jumping on a band wagon of misinformation and hyperbole, and it makes all sides look bad.

But when you're getting multiple posts a day, complaining about the Olympics, which are easily debunked in 1 comment, it does start to look as if people have just got some contrarian fight the power teenage angst agenda, and I reserve the right to the decry that sort of behaviour.

For example; it costs Â£40 to feed a family at the Olympics! Queue outrage - Whereas the truth is, not it doesn't, you can do it for Â£26. That's a huge difference, Not to mention Â£40 to feed a family is not that bad. You go pizza express for less than Â£40. Not happening.

Or the story about kids have to wear Adidas trainers. Again, not true. 

Or the story where Seb Coe said you wouldn't be allowed in wearing a Pepsi T-Shirt; Again, LOCOG issued a statement the day before saying that would not be an issue. Seb Coe would not be the relevant authority on that issue, people were just fishing for outrage.

It has experienced a variety of reurbanisation and gentrification so it has a chance of being costly, but that comes with the area. Brighton is all round a rather expensive place. Even beach huts are fetching phenomenal amounts of money.

It's a great idea to move to Brighton if it is not going to get in the way of your jobs. It just depends on what properties are available.

Hazard's performance wasn't as good as it was against Seattle, but it was still good nonetheless. Defenders seem to fear him and jockey backwards when he runs at them because he is such a good dribbler. He, like Marin, also has excellent vision and some of the passes he was playing yesterday really made me think that we have signed quite a player. He is slowly becoming my favourite player.

Kakuta does not look good enough for the first team at the moment and he will probably be loaned out again.

I'd like to see Piazon play in the CAM position for a game seeing as that's his natural role. He looked comfortable on the ball for most of the time he was on and I was happy that he scored.

No-one ever said that all sex predators were asian or that only brown people rape young girls. That was never the point.

Ok this is all I could dig up for now, more later:

[Torygraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8248347/Are-white-girls-really-easy-meat.html):

&gt;In industrial towns across the North and the Midlands, over the past three years, at least 51 people have been convicted in trials involving groups of men who have picked up young girls for sexual exploitation. Forty-eight of the offenders were Asian

edit: Can't find the Guardian claim, more from the [Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/child-sex-grooming-the-asian-question-7729068.html):

&gt;The overall statistics give the lie to such claims. Greater Manchester Police, in whose area the offences took place, has declared that 95 per cent of the men on its sex offenders register are white. Just five per cent are Asian. But things do look different when the focus is narrowed to crimes involving groups of men grooming girls on the street. In 18 child sexual exploitation trials since 1997 â in Derby, Leeds, Blackpool, Blackburn, Rotherham, Sheffield, Rochdale, Oldham and Birmingham â relating to the on-street grooming of girls aged 11 to 16 by two or more men, most of those convicted were of Pakistani heritage.

&gt;Something similar has happened to a support group called Crop (the Coalition for the Removal of Pimping), for the parents of sexually exploited girls. Since 2002 the group, which is based in Leeds, has supported the families of 400 victims, including that of Emma Jackson. Last year it was saying that the families had suffered mainly at the hands of Pakistani men.

&gt;Last year, the government's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre launched a five-month investigation into the issue. It took the broadest definition of underage grooming, describing it as any situation where a child or young person receives something in exchange for performing sexual favours.

&gt;The centre identified 2,379 potential offenders who had been reported for grooming since 2008. The vast majority were men. Most were aged 18 to 24. It could fully identify only 940 of the suspects. Of these, **38 per cent were white, 32 per cent were recorded as of unknown ethnicity, 26 per cent were Asian**, 3 per cent were black and less than 1 per cent were Chinese.",0,1343046629,null,0,1343048899,0,c5i2gti,t3_x09ze,t1_c5i2gti,t1_c5i2f2k,null,1429446594,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

What have you seen that is made up? There are more than enough flaws throughout the entire games setup that i'd be surprised if people were needing to make anything up. The Â£40 story is true for some outlets in the parks, just not all and those kids were asked to wear adidas trainers, they're just not being forced to. These things are both true. The crap about the Pepsi tshirt comes from fucking Coe himself who said they ""probably"" would not be able to get in. The very reason Locog issued a statement THE DAY AFTER was to correct his misunderstanding. Seb Coe fucking should be a relevant authority on this shit, he's presided over most of this. 

Sometimes daily mail outrage is worth it before we even consider things such as the freaking cost when we are in the middle of the worst economic situation since the great depression. the idiocy of building a stadium only to knock it down when we have just built wembley. The awful laws around using the words gold, summer and 2012. The missile silos in central london. The terrifying laws that police enter peoples house within the olympic districts to remove political material. that we're spending all this time and effort whilst hacking at education, the nhs and the welfare state. the total corporate sell out of it all. The fact that charities have been nobbled by the games taking all of the lottery money that was previously shared out. 

The olympics could be great, let them hold it wherever they like, just don't expect an entire country to pay several hundred pounds each for it and then try to sell them tickets without them getting pissed off. In its current form it is a truly horrible event.

For instance, why is 'industrial towns across the North and the Midlands' a meaningful area for comparison? It smacks of a case study, or casual accumulation of information, being dressed up as a meaningful statistical study.

Edit in response to your edit: The last time I heard about this was on More or Less, which looked at the data which was available 18 months ago, when Jack Straw made his comments, and essentially concluded that there [was no solid proof either way](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/moreorless/moreorless_20110114-1400b.mp3). The numbers in the Telegraph would appear to come from a journalist at the Times, who basically googled court cases in a systematic way. But it does mention that the CEOP report you quote was going to be published, and that would seem to be the key evidence. But the bit you quote talks about suspects, not even people who have been arrested, let alone convicted. And it only provides ethnicity data for less than 40% of those people.

Edit 2: I would also point out, that we are talking about small samples here. If the evidence you quote about street gangs proves to be correct, is it really fair to blame the culture of something like 700,000 Pakistani Britons, on the basis of 50 men and five separate cases? If white people in my area were convicted of such a crime they would be bastards, not representatives of my culture. Even if some politician in Pakistan reckoned it was down to young white males, and their salacious cultural attitude towards women. It's very easy to cast these sort of aspersions.

I think that this is one of the main factors in why the case got more media attention, rather than just because the media is racist, because its more like one big crime as opposed to several smaller isolated ones. Similarly I'd bet that the recent shooting in Colorado probably got more media attention than every homicide combined in the last month because its much more newsworthy.

As his note was emailed directly to me and others - I can assure you he blamed the Council and had no other issues except for diabetes and the severe depression which was due to the Councils actions.

His family knew nothing - he kept it from them as kept the existence of his family from his friends. 

More facts here: http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/07/20/the-shocking-story-of-how-a-council-pursued-peter-williams/

Being directly involved I can assure it is factually correct - I have even quoted the Council's stance on this.  The reality is he'd be alive today if he'd received even an ounce of compassion or humanity from CBDC.  There was zero requirement to evict him except for greed.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;What have you seen that is made up? There are more than enough flaws throughout the entire games setup that i'd be surprised if people were needing to make anything up. The Â£40 story is true for some outlets in the parks, just not all and those kids were asked to wear adidas trainers, they're just not being forced to. These things are both true. The crap about the Pepsi tshirt comes from fucking Coe himself who said they ""probably"" would not be able to get in. The very reason Locog issued a statement THE DAY AFTER was to correct his misunderstanding. Seb Coe fucking should be a relevant authority on this shit, he's presided over most of this. 

So, you agree with my points then. What was made up was that the children would forced. That was not true. The rest is hyperbole and misinformation, as you agree.

You keep talking about the cost; but you've already agreed we don't know the figures. I've seen figures saying that they will boost GDP to plus 0.3%-0.4% for the quarter. I've seen figures that suggest total cost would be be similar to the economic benefits. Now, take off the corporate funding that gives us a net profit, plus a significant amount of the cost will be on facilities and infrastructure that will be benefit London long after the games. There is already a cycling event in the Velodrome planned next year that will bring in millions of pounds into the local economy. Plus it has provided a huge number of jobs throughout the country.

The ticketing was a fiasco, I'll give you that one.

I agree that the Olympics has its issues, but the misinformation and hyperbole that I'm highlighting are really quite boring and counter-productive.

In fact, the London Olympics has a fucking shedload of problems. It's full of problems. One of the most problematic of modern times. But there seems to be a significant faction that are determined to see the Olympics fail. And that's bollocks. But at least have the decency to complain about the real issues.

The inconvenience, the ticketing fiasco's, G4S, over-zealous brand protection.

But if people are going to start making it look worse than it is, then that really doesn't help anyone. We've got a chance to give the economy a boost when it really needs it, and a chance to be the centre of the world's attention and have a jolly good knees up that could even turn us a decent profit.

So, I'm merely suggesting that any naysayers should at try and focus on genuine issues, rather than jumping on every opportunity to take a shot at the Olympics.",0,1343050775,null,0,false,0,c5i33zn,t3_wz1fx,t1_c5i33zn,t1_c5i2igc,null,1429446898,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Nothing going forward in the first half, Lukaku just wanted the ball played over the top so he could run it down and body defenders off, but his positioning wasn't quite right, and the other guys were hesitant to play it. 

I didn't think Kakuta was all that bad. Personally, I thought De Bruyne was worse, lost the ball or played it back almost every time he got it, Kakuta rarely had it but went forward a few times and played a few decent balls. I think both ought to be loaned out. 

As for Essien, I'm kind of on the fence. I see his footwork getting better, he's more confident using his body again, but I just don't think he can be a serious contributor for this team. Sure, he could be a quality sub for 20-30 minutes, but I don't think he's worthy of starting, not even in limited doses. Not that he'll need to, assuming we play with this formation and Lampard-Mikel-Meireles sharing in the double pivot role behind Mata/Ramires/Hazard.

2. Marin did some great stuff, while Hazard was mostly ineffective.  That said, Hazard's first half compatriots weren't exactly helping him.

3. Those that showed their passion were Ramires, David Luiz, Ashley Cole, Mikel, and Marko Marin.  Everyone else looked like they either didn't want to be there or were completely exhausted.

4. Be glad you didn't attend the game - A lot of embarrassing stuff.  The in-stadium announcer was a fucking idiot (player receives yellow card - calls it a red card, screwing up player names - ""John Mikel Obi"", etc.).  Made me embarrassed to be an American fan.  Yankee Stadium also had players from both teams sitting on hard metal benches - the kind you'd sit on if you played high school soccer.  Another embarrassing moment.  They normally sit in leather bucket seats...at least give them a padded bench, Christ.  Many of the Chelsea players did not have photos displayed during the introductions on the jumbotron.

4. Props to John Terry for coming over to sign autographs an hour before the match.  What a cool dude.",0,1343052986,null,0,false,0,c5i3j69,t3_wzvqy,t1_c5i3j69,t3_wzvqy,null,1429447098,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

&gt;The city's bid proclaimed: ""Every sector of the economy will benefit from the staging of the Olympic Games."" Originally slated to cost about Â£2.4bn, Olympic costs jumped to Â£9.3bn by 2007. The National Audit Office noted that public-sector funding has almost tripled, while private-sector contributions dwindled to less than 2%. Recently, the House of Commons' public accounts committee revealed costs were ""heading for around Â£11bn"". Meanwhile, Olympics critic Julian Cheyne of Games Monitor calculates costs at Â£13bn. A Sky Sports investigation included public transport upgrade costs, catapulting the five-ring price tag to Â£24bn.

&gt;The public-pays-private-bails theme crystallised in the construction of the Olympic village. Originally envisaged as a Â£1bn centrepiece of London 2012's urban regeneration plan, the village was to be financed by Australian developer Lend Lease... But the 2008 economic collapse and credit crunch led private capital to abandon the project, leaving it to the British government. In spring 2009, Olympics honchos admitted the village would be ""fully nationalised"" â that is, paid for by taxpayers.

The reason why they ask you repeatedly is because for most agencies they're under contract to ask you three times, in decreasing values of donation.  When I say you don't need to be rude to them, I don't mean clearly telling them no, I just meant that people don't need to swear and treat them like shit. 
There is a lot of taking advantage of people and it is encouraged by the managers. At the last agency that I was working for one of the new staff asked how much guilt we're meant to apply to the public, and they were very adamant about calling it guilt. I think they referred to it as creating an 'emotional attachment to the cause with the public'.  
Which is their way of saying 'don't get caught trying to make them feel guilty'. But that's how they get the most donations, by making you feel too guilty to say no, and I think that's one reason why a majority of people dislike them, it's emotional blackmail.

I always though this was the case. I was once told by someone who worked in telesales that his second favorite customers were the ones who hung up on him the instant they realised he was a salesman. He needed to ring a hundred and fifty people an hour. He had no time to waste on polite people who werenât going to buy his product.

&gt;Normally though, blanking them isn't really a problem, to some it can get to them

Yes, I've had a couple of run ins with chuggers and sales people who don't like being ignored.

I actually find the ones who knock on your door more irritating. We had a spate of them last year just before Christmas. They all started the conversation by saying ""Hi, I'm $Irritating_Bastard_Selling_Overpriced_Broadband, how are you?""

I soon cottoned on that the purpose of the greeting was to have me start a conversation, rather than just slam the door in their face. ""Uh .. I'm fine. Thanks"". ""Oh great, well I'm just here to ..."" and since I'm now in a dialogue with this person, and they've been nice to me, it's much harder to extricate myself without feeling like I'm being rude.

Fortunately, I'm an obnoxious and confrontational bastard at the very best of times, so when they ask how I am I just tell them I'm irritated and slam the door.

&gt;Really not sure what your motive is here or why I am being downvoted. It seems like your aim is to marginalize American fans who don't ever get to see their team in action by downplaying the importance of playing decent football, even if it is only a friendly. Are you English, by chance?

Christ, you've really read quite a lot into my saying that you shouldn't read too much into performances in friendlies. I don't see how saying that you shouldn't get too upset about a perceived lack of effort translates into you accusing me of downplaying the importance of playing decent football. I'd humbly suggest removing that colossal chip on your shoulder, old bean. I couldn't care less where any Chelsea fan is from - I do care when I get bizarrely accused of marginalising them when in fact I was having a normal discussion as I would with any Chelsea fan. That you played that card says quite a lot about you, I feel.

Well, yes. If you're asking why a team plays well one week and then not so well the next then I think you're in for a surprise in any sport you watch.

Overall, you're perfectly entitled to get pissed off, but this isn't a crucial game in the league - it's a friendly. If you misunderstand the purpose of pre-season and were expecting a full on Munich-esque level of commitment then I don't know how I can help you...

true,redem,null,null,"&gt; You're cherry picking. It's about small-scale ecologically sustainable farming using modern, but ""low-cost and locally available technologies and inputs"" as opposed to industrial monoculture.

I don't see how it's cherry picking. They're not comparing industrial farming to small scale farming. They're taking about how, in poor nations that cannot afford to invest in high tech modern farming machinery and techniques, they've managed to improve yields and reduce pollution anyway by using some of the improvements from the rich world's farming industry.

In other words, we can improve upon the traditional small scale farming methods and this study shows some results of efforts to do just that.

In fact, one of the biggest problems for such poor farmers is that the world's industrial farmers are too productive, providing harsh competition.

&gt; On what grounds? I accept it's basically anecdotal rather than scientific of course, but can it be discounted and rejected out of hand merely for that? 

In part, but also because no data or methodology is given, merely claimed conclusions written in an advocacy tone. Indeed, an anti-capitalism advocate. As such, I am not willing to take his word for anything.

The first link is academic tone and structure. Can't completely speak for their data, but I'm willing to accept it for the sake of argument. And their sources do seem largely valid.

&gt; The actual labour inputs to permaculture, once established, are actually quite minimal in terms of hours worked, because the whole thrust of it is to establish guilds which are largely self-reinforcing and work with nature rather than against it as with traditional farming.

That's about the opposite of true. ""Guilds"" will completely remove the possibility of automation in harvesting and so forth, increasing labour costs compared to industrial farms.

&gt;  It would also clearly involve a larger proportion of the world's population going ""back to the land"", but that's not necessarily unattractive for many people - especially in an era in which it is becoming increasingly clear that industrial production cannot provide the mass employment it once did

That's not a bad thing, though. We did not lose out simply because we replaced millions of textile jobs with a few tens of thousands of jobs in textiles and mechanisation. Nor did we lose out by replacing massive mining teams with a few minutes running machines.

More people involved in framing on a small scale is a poor plan. Sustainable, sure, in the sense that it will result in a smaller carrying capacity and thus megadeath.

I do not support this goal.

&gt; Obviously, calorific intake is the major contributor to weight gain, but it's clearly easier to become fat and unhealthy on some foods as opposed to others.

Secondly, I seriously have no idea why you are doing what you are doing at this time in your life. The cost of living in England is typically much higher than it is in the USA, and we are in a terrible economic downturn anyway.

My advice would be to pay off your massive debts in the USA, as you wont have to pay through the teeth starting a new life, being at uni, and paying off debts in a new and unfamiliar country.

However, as you are willing to live in London I'm assuming you are relatively moneyed. Therefore if you are SURE you want to make this move, I would recommend somewhere on the south coast like Eastbourne or maybe Brighton. Lovely weather, not disgustingly pricey (well Brighton can be) and good rail links to south, and by extension of the tube, central London.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;They're not comparing industrial farming to small scale farming. They're taking about how, in poor nations that cannot afford to invest in high tech modern farming machinery and techniques, they've managed to improve yields and reduce pollution anyway by using some of the improvements from the rich world's farming industry.

But they're also talking about how small locally-oriented low-tech organic farms can improve their efficiency vis a vis industrial monocultural ones which are causing mayhem in Africa.

&gt;one of the biggest problems for such poor farmers is that the world's industrial farmers are too productive, providing harsh competition.

Of course, they're also massively subsidised by their respective governments, and the whole process is driven by the same mentality which drove the Indians out of cotton processing in order to allow the UK cotton industry to thrive and drive India into poverty for the duration of the Raj! - but that's drifting too far into politics.

&gt;I am not willing to take his word for anything.

But, assuming you're a scientist, you should at least be willing to test a testable hypothesis...?  No?  Sadly, agribusiness isn't, for reasons of its own which have everything to do with (capitalist) politics, and nothing to do with science.

&gt;""Guilds"" will completely remove the possibility of automation in harvesting and so forth, increasing labour costs compared to industrial farms.

So, ultimately, you admit, you arguments are grounded in capitalist economics, not in productivity nor feeding people - just making a profit!

&gt;Sustainable, sure, in the sense that it will result in a smaller carrying capacity and thus megadeath.

I put it to you that you're wrong, and it's monoculture which will lead to a global die out.  [And MIT and the latest data support me](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Looking-Back-on-the-Limits-of-Growth.html).
