My personal recommendations, all in the immediate area of Bangor:

**Snowdon** - great mountain to climb if you can tolerate the hordes of tourists. Pretty easy as mountains go in Gwynedd, despite being the tallest in Wales. Plus as another poster pointed out there's a train to the top if you don't fancy the walk.

**Cwm Idwal** - A fantastic glacial cirque at the head of a dramatic valley ten minutes' drive from the city. One of the most spectacular spots in Snowdonia, and it's only a short, easy walk from the A5. 

**Caernarfon Castle** - One of the finest Medieval castles in Europe, one of the numerous great fortresses built by the English King Edward I to consolidate his conquest of the country. The town itself is pretty nice too, particularly the old bit inside the town walls.

**Menai Strait** - Living in Bangor, you're hardly going to miss it, but it's worth appreciating it properly, IMO. There's a damn good tea room at the end of Bangor pier, the Menai Bridge (the first proper suspension bridge in the world and pretty to look at to boot), and it's worth going up the Marquess of Anglesey's Column in Llanfairpwll on the other side, too - fantastic views of the strait with Snowdonia behind.

There's loads of historical sites in the area worth a look - Bryn Celli Ddu, Barclodiad y Gawres and Din Lligwy on Anglesey, the dramatic hillfort of Tre'r Ceiri on the Llyn Peninsula, loads of castles, both Welsh (Dolwyddelan, Dolbadarn, Criccieth) and English (Harlech, Conwy, Beaumaris)...",0,1340074837,null,0,false,0,c52frw2,t3_v8t8g,t1_c52frw2,t3_v8t8g,null,1429175075,5,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,5

I thought the first three seasons, up until they killed the mother, were fantastic, because up until then, I didn't mind the stupid flat characters since they were for the sake of comedy. Buffy was always light-hearted before that. The show taking a ""serious"" turn was probably the worst decision ever made in TV history; it would be like if, halfway through the show, *Seinfeld* decided it wanted to be serious. For this reason, the rest of the episodes were shit, and all five seasons of *Angel* were simply ok. Except for the finale of *Angel*; god that was stupid.

My father even own the book *The Quotable Slayer.* I even asked him to help me apply the Yahtzee Test I mentioned earlier: he would pick a random quote from the book and ask me who said it and nine times out of ten, I wouldn't be able to do it. Compare that with *Doctor Who*, or fucking *My Little Pony* for Christ's sake: literally almost single line in those shows, if it were said by another character, would sound out of character. Find a quote from Buffy, read it, and without knowing who the character saying it, guess.

All of Joss Whedon's characters sound the same, and I do not think a flat, generic, ""witty"" characters can be classified as ""strong"" in my books.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"This is probably an unfair statement to make but I believe Mata hasn't shown himself to be much of a finisher this season; Silva has. 

Although both of them ended with the same number of goals this season, I would probably count on Silva to attempt a goal-scoring chance rather than Mata. I would expect Mata to hover somewhere on the edge of the box, creating that killer through-ball for a striker like Torres or an late-in-the-box midfielder/winger like Lamps/Sturry/Kalou to finish it. Moreover, Silva offers more options in terms of playing positions on the pitch as compared to Mata.

IMO, the role that Mata plays is more of a pseudo false 9; not the double negative kind, but more the Cesc Fabregas kind.

Then again, this season was tactically weird. The first half saw him cutting in from the flank trying to float crosses, while the second half saw him trying to maintain possession in the middle of the park. In both cases his role was the same - trying to unlock defences for his striking partners. Scoring goals seemed to be a distant second on his list of priorities. Maybe next season.

My parents divorced when I was young, I lived with my mother who was an alcoholic. I never really fitted in at school, was bullied for a small amount of time when I was younger but it was corrected. Always been quite a computer geek.

Anyway, when I was 16 my mother died, and I couldn't live with my dad so I became homeless, living in these homes for homeless teenagers which was shit. At the time I started on Job Seekers, but when I became too old to stay in those houses I ended up in a situation where I was going to be completely homeless. So I ended up on disability benefits (DLA and ESA, plus housing benefit) in a council flat.

I used to be really depressed and I think that is largely how I could get diagnosed as having aspergers, but honestly I think if I do have it then it is too weak to really be worth benefits.

I managed to get into university, and have started to be a lot happier recently. But I am now in the odd position. You are able to get the student loan as usual when on disability benefits, however it is under a different name, a ""special support grant"" so that it wont affect benefits. Basically, I get the student loan, yet the housing benefit is paying for my accommodation. This basically means I am going to university for ""free"" since I could pay back the loan immediately (though I am just saving it up and spending it a bit). 

This is the story of how I am living on disability benefits while not actually being disabled.

true,Riddla26,eng-manchester,Manchester - City Of Science,"Here's the letter I sent to my MP [from here](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/cdb), sorry for the wall of text but I hope you all follow suit:

I am writing to you because I am very concerned about the new 'Communications Data Bill'. There are fundamental flaws in the reasoning behind the creation of the bill that should be heavily scrutinized by any MP who is committed, as part of the government of the UK, to govern with responsibility and with the citizens best interests at heart. The reasoning that the bill is it is ""maintaining capability"" for law enforcement, this statement is outright false at best. The government and the police have great capabilities already more capability than they have ever had in the course of history, that extends to retrieving information from ISPs and phone companies in the course of crime prevention given a courts permission. The problem is their application of this capability.

This bill seeks to remove the warrant requirement from these kinds of activities, allowing the UK public to be (for lack of a better work) spied upon by their own government. Massive amounts of data will be collected on every person in the UK and while a large percentage will be inconsequential, are all private communications that may compound a persons business interests and social interactions as well as the sharing of sensitive private information between loved ones and family members including medical information or financial intentions and woes. Information which - should it fall into the wrong hands - could potentially damage and/or destroy any persons life, never mind the damage caused if it were to be a blue chip CEO or an MP.

I also believe very personal information will be collected, held and accessed in insecure ways and that access will not be properly regulated. As a former employee of the main supplier of government information technology services (personally served the Home Office and UKBA) who holds a CS level government security clearance and being an experienced practitioner in my field, I can assure you that the measures the agencies have in place for storing data are almost 100% INEFFECTIVE against attack. The data they currently collect is not stored in a secure enough manner and I am adamant that any new data will be stored in the same way (after all, the government haven't got ¬£10m to blow on a new secure encrypted data centre, but that's not the point).

Aside from the technical and social aspects, reasonable powers to access information for law enforcement purposes are a good idea. But the powers created by the draft Bill are far too broad and do not involve adequate safeguards. You could also take the example of the American TSA as a great case-study of why this kind of blanket power is ineffective. The TSA was given complete control of airport security and in the 11 years since the September 11th 2001 attacks on New York, the powers the TSA has have successfully stopped a total of 0 attacks. There have been attempted attacks, but they were stopped by traditional security practises and the vigilance of the public, not by the massively invasive searches and useless radiation-spitting full body scanners. What they have done is invaded the privacy of ordinary American men, women and even children and subjected them to un-necessary, shameful and ridiculous searches in the name of ""protection"".

Everybody's information will be collected and stored, rather than just those under suspicion. I don't believe that information about my communications should be collected for no reason and accessed so easily, especially when there is little to no consideration of who will be doing the accessing.

Access to the information will not require a warrant, meaning law enforcement deciding for themselves whether access is necessary, this is a clear step towards authoritarian rule, what's to stop law enforcement digging and digging at the private communications of someone simply because that officer holds a grudge, until they find something that can be used against that person. Not every law enforcement officer is squeaky clean and at the end of the day they are all people with their own conflicts and issues. The powers the bill grants give this type of behaviour LITERALLY free-reign for abuse of the data.

The government says the Bill is just about ‚Äúmaintaining capability‚Äù, but actually the 'communications data' held by services like Facebook is much richer and invasive than, say, records of telephone conversations. This deserves a higher standard of oversight to make sure whistleblowers or journalists sources are not put at risk.

I haven't seen evidence that would justify the scope and nature of these powers or the cost of the programme.

I think the Bill undermines commitments made by the coalition to enhance our civil liberties and roll back the surveillance state.

I would like to encourage you to oppose this Bill unless it changes significantly. Powers to collect and access communications information need to be tightened, not expanded ever further.",0,1340099509,null,0,false,0,c52jrhy,t3_v95z5,t1_c52jrhy,t3_v95z5,null,1429176954,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,leondz,eu,Britain,"That's an interesting implication to perceive; where did you draw it from?

Let me make the argument clearer. Every system is based on a model, and all models are imperfect. Most systems for handling anything with any degree of complexity are imperfect, and has some sort of error margin, which may be high or small. One can generally choose whether these errors are mostly false positives or mostly false negatives, to some extent. When errors are made, in this case, they either lead to someone getting too much state support or too little. Our current system, when given a certain amount of funds, attempts to allocate it fairly, and leans away from false negatives. Which is fine. I personally would rather five hundred fraudulent claimants are supported than one disabled guy die alone and freezing because his application was somewhat dubious. 

Now, let's step back from the false negatives/false positive balance and look at the system and its costs. The size of the error margin is independent of the amount of funds allocated for dispersal to claimants - if you want a more accurate system (that moves money from fraudulent claimants to school, for example) then removing funding will not achieve this; we need to increase the sophistication of the system. This costs time in government employee hours and increased system complexity. As you can imagine, there comes a cut-off point where the amount saved by making the system more accurate is smaller than the amount that it costs to get that accuracy gain (in terms of people and time). This reduces the whole to a simple optimisation problem. If you scream ""make it more accurate"", this might happen, and then the opposing set of politicians will yell about ""inefficient system"", and they'd be perfectly correct to do so.",0,1340102423,null,0,1340103207,0,c52k0bv,t3_v8eap,t1_c52k0bv,t1_c52jpp7,null,1429177066,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The current wave of poaching is being committed by sophisticated criminal networks using helicopters, night-vision equipment, veterinary tranquilisers and silencers to kill rhinos at night while attempting to avoid law enforcement patrols.
‚ÄúThe criminal syndicates operating in South Africa are highly organised and use advanced technologies.  They are very well coordinated,‚Äù said Dr. Joseph Okori, WWF African Rhino Programme Manager.  ‚ÄúThis is not typical poaching.‚Äù

There is big money involved, enough to act like this:

&gt;After a kill, they would pass the horns to others to sell. ""But I only made small money,"" he says, noting that he, Andre, and a couple others would split about $11,000 for a pair of horns weighing 13 pounds. In the end Deon's discontent with his cut led to his arrest. He killed a rhino on his own and was caught selling it.  
Now Deon is the one being hunted. Police have pressured him to testify against Saaiman and others. He is clearly fearful of the prospect. **Just a few days after Deon's arrest, Saaiman's wife was shot in the throat in her driveway and died in front of her children. Six months ago, Deon's ex-wife was raped in their home.** She and their four children have since gone into witness protection. Not long after, men claiming to be private investigators visited Deon in prison and offered him a new truck, $100,000, and a job as a PH not to testify.

true,rq4c,null,null,"&gt; Well agreeing to hear you or someone else out, always. I don't think I'm ready to agree with you on your ideas yet though, as firstly since you've defined democracy as merely necessary. (I could be just reading a casual tone, here and if that's not intentional forgive me, but if true I'd say it [democracy] is fundamentally important in any governance for it's legitimacy and for it's strength and longevity.)

Democracy is necessary for a well-functioning society; without it you suffer dictatorship or anarchy.

However, ""fundamentally important in any governance""? No.

On board a ship you have a benign dictatorship. It works.

Similarly, a construction project -- tall building, bridge, etc -- has a project manager, team leaders, chief engineers, etc., none of whom, thankfully, were elected. They were chosen (appointed) for their education, knowledge, understanding and experience.

Bad political ideas collapse under the weight of reality. Fortunately, our buildings and bridges (modern era) do not.

Don't fall into the trap of raising democracy to the level of a god or a religion. Necessary, fundamentally important, yes -- but see it for what it is, warts and all.

The aim must be to have a well-functioning society in which people are free to pursue their lives in whatever manner they choose subject to the constraint of that freedom being given to all other people. Democracy is part of the mechanism that we use to achieve this.

We have a democratically elected law-making chamber. I would not change that. Indeed I would literally fight to keep it. However, I would introduce a meritocratically appointed Senate to *revise* the laws and help mitigate the flaws in the elected chamber. Another elected chamber will only amplify the flaws.

&gt; I must make it clear I have no love for political parties. I think it was George Washington who made a point about loathing their structure while American politics was becoming factionalised. They often provide a simplistic stepping stone to being involved in governance for all the wrong reasons, namely being career orientated and further they often close their circles against people who appear to be of a different logo. 

So how would you fix this?

&gt; However, I see a practical benefit to them to, they often bring compromise and pool ideas together.

Pooling ideas, yes, but they also enhance each others prejudices: if you have a bad idea you will be encouraged to stick to it if surrounded by others who support you. A narrow church fills with the narrow minded. And good ideas get compromised out because they go against party doctrine. ""Every new opinion, at its starting, is precisely in a minority of one"" -- Thomas Carlyle.

&gt; Yeah, it would be lovely if a chamber were filled with adequately brilliant academics and theoreticians, of course that is why you appoint advisors. How they do that, I often have trouble with and how they're eventually got rid of and why even more so (if they've broached controversy for the wrong reasons politically).

Indeed, which is why we need a council of the wise who *will* listen to good advice without partisan rejection.

&gt; What you seem to have in mind is a council of elders sort of thing, I gather, 

Yes.

&gt; which while nice I don't think carries the same weight if they're dealing with local issues

I am only advocating a Senate at national level.

&gt; or something inanely simple that are often broached in certain bills

Inanely simple is often mis-treated by the elected, but would be seen for what it is and dealt with correctly by the wise. Sometimes though, upon analysis, the 'inanely simple' turns out to be substantially complex -- wise people have experience of this kind of thing too.

&gt; that contain aspects of life a bit beyond their means and experience.

What aspects of life beyond their means and experience? If you are referring to the problems of 'ordinary' people, then the Professor who started life as a poor immigrant, and has achieved her status out of merit, will understand far better than the increasingly common, public-school educated MP.

&gt; Moreover I'm still a little worried about how they're going to be appointed, it's a little vague. Which chartered institutes? 

All of them.

&gt; And how - internal elections or external appointments? Can I or anyone else have a say?

Leave it up to them. Any kind of 'popular vote' will fall prey to popularism -- the most effective self-promoters will win. Unless self-promotion is a useful trait in a Senator... :)

We need a revising chamber of non-partisan wisdom to counter partisan stupidity coming from the other place. If not my suggestion then how?

Yeah, it'd be nice to have more jobs for people to do, but you'd just end up with too many people, and you can only recruit so fast before things become an unmitigated mess. Not to mention ""unskilled"" work often requires certain talents. 

If you want to see the mess in action, make or join a ""random invite"" guild in an MMO. Soon, the whole thing just falls apart and isn't much of a community, with a whole bunch of people trying to leech off the smarter ones, who will eventually leave or quit. Same thing can happen if you try and employ any bugger. Public sector is in enough of a mess, without being forced to find roles for people who may not fit in anywhere.

If the politicians sodded off - then probably yes.

In theory, I don't actually care who the shareholders in a company are - whether it is owned by individuals, companies, investors, or a government department.

My only gripe about state-ownership is that the company is then a plaything of politicians and rarely allowed to be run to the maximum efficiency of the business.

This becomes a stealth tax on companies reliant on the SOE - in the form of higher costs and lower efficiencies.

Now, if the SOE was allowed to be utterly independent of the politicians - much in the way a PLC is de-facto independent of its shareholders, then that would make me warm towards state ownership.

If the politicians then want to create jobs or spend money on ""x"", then it has to be done openly, independently of the SOE, and not hidden as a politicians pet project within a state-owned company.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"It's not a matter of learning. I spent a couple of decades *obsessively* trying to overcome my problems. All I got for it is ever more severe burnouts.

I have Aspergers. The causes of Aspergers are neurological. One issue turns out to be a flaw in the part of the brain that triggers the autonomic stress response. It is also the part of the brain that processes things like facial expressions and tone of voice. Seeing someones face or hearing someones voice can trigger a severe stress reaction because of a wiring flaw.

People misunderstand stress too. Adrenaline is a stress hormone, associated with fear, yet adrenaline junkies aren't considered to be too scared and pathetic to do anything. They literally go out seeking a stress reaction because the enjoy it.

The trouble is, that's short bursts of stress in control. According to a neuroimaging laboratory, stress in autism can get ""jammed on at the maximum physically possible levels"" for long periods. Stress at that level causes physical damage, including (ironically enough) to a key part of the brain that is essential to regulating the stress response.

This is a major reason why mental disorders such as anxiety and depression get progressively worse with age - each cycle of stress burnout does damage that leaves the stress response even more out of control.

I felt the fear and did it anyway. For well over a decade. And I'm substantially more damaged now because of it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hello honest Christian, an honest atheist here.  

Some Christians are very forceful in their views, and some sects have views which are anti-liberal (for example: gay marriage, women's rights etc).  Liberals of all persuasions usually engage those types in heated debate, from atheists to Quakers.

However, there are some atheists who see religion itself to be a threat.  The argument goes like this: religion is faith-based, therefore accepting religion makes it more acceptable to take anything on faith, and that's dangerous.  That's how you get facism, alternative ""medicine"" and other harmful things.  People need to know this is wrong.

Taking that argument, those atheists (people like Richard Dawkins), see a.. well.. a kind of Holy War against religion, just as much as the Hellfire preachers see a Holy War against atheism.

And we all know how winnable Holy Wars are (at least when you're not allowed to commit genocide).  So they just keep going at each other, neither budging an inch.

While the rest of us just glance over, raise an eyebrow, and then start chatting to our neighbour about the weather.

In the UK, we have specific problems due to the influence of the Church in government (Bishops in the Lords etc) and the Pope loves to get involved in policy and try to influence laws.  Again, secularists of all faiths are against this, but it doesn't stop hateful atheists from pretending that it's an ""us against them"" problem.

So ""solving"" it is not going to be simple. There are legitimate reasons firms or people might choose to avoid tax, and there are people who are essentially evading tax in all but name, and they will probably be using similar methods. And to make matters worse our tax system is very complex (as anyone who deals in accounting will tell you). So there are no simple steps to end tax avoidance, and the often quoted figure of ¬£25B isn't a sum we will every be able to fully ""recover"".

I don't believe a young person's railcard counts towards travelcards, and I think it's a weekly or monthly season ticket you want to get out to Epsom. It is inevitably pricey, but the one good thing is you'll be travelling against London's epic flow of commuters both ways.

Most public sector workers are paid less than the average wage. This is especially true when you ignore, for example, teachers and doctors who are quite well dispersed per capita around the country. The areas with the highest proportion of public sector workers are generally areas with lower than average wages as to begin with, but they are also tend to be areas of higher unemployment so quite how wages are being inflated by the mere presence of public sector workers I don't know.

Also, anyone who suggests that public sector workers are driving up house prices (presumably with their profligate house-buying - those dinner ladies and jobcentre plus admin staff are notorious for collecting houses like Larry Gagosian collects sculpture) is a fool.

My point was - there has never been a true Communist country.

Are you telling me that Russia in 1917 under the Tsar was capitalist ? I would love to  hear your evidence to back this up...

Lenin advised skipping the capitalist stage entirely and to initiate state capitalism - this is NOT what Marx has suggested and where the soviet government control over people's lives comes in... Marx said the the capitalism stage was necessary to fund the revolution... 

(Why would he have needed to initiate this if Russia was already capitalist..)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism

During World War I, using Vladimir Lenin's idea that Czarism was taking a ""Prussian path"" to capitalism, the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin identified a new stage in the development of capitalism, in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had become managed by the state; he termed this new stage 'state capitalism.'

Also check out

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism#Use_by_Maoists_and_.22Anti-Revisionists.22

For China ...

Again according to Marx they should have been capitalist previous to the revolution not a need for 'state capitlaism'

Russia (arguably until the 90's) and China have never been Communist just like they haven't been capitalist either.

&gt;State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months‚Äô time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country.

Bollocks.

Regardless of whether or not they ever reached their desired destination of ""True Communism"", their paths to Communism were littered with rampant corruption, personality cultism, and millions of dead men women and children.

All of these nations had opportunities to follow the word of Marx to the letter, and yet none of them did.


And there in lies the fundamental issue with Communism. It makes absolutely no account for human nature, as humans are inately hierarchical and self-interested. The only thing we a species can do is try to harness this self interest for the greater good. Thus: Capitalism.

We have Sandro, Parker, Huddlestone, Livermore, Modric and Van der Vaart (it would be natural for him to play a bit deeper in such a system - he's not too well suited to being part of a front three which will likely consist of a centre forward and two inside forwards).

Given Modric's likely departure, we'll be needing a creative, attacking centre mid to add to the other five, and Sessegnon fits that bill pretty well. While I'd rather we were going for Dembele, I'd be fine with him instead, especially as he has the qualities to do well at inside forward too if required.

While it's been noted that his very successful past season was played largely in a second striker role, it should be remembered that this was new to him this season - for most of his career he's played as a deeper central midfield playmaker.

I'd be pretty happy if we went into this year with a central midfield consisting of Parker or Sandro sitting behind two out of Huddlestone, Van der Vaart and Sessegnon, with Livermore given as many oppotunities as possible before a second half of the season loan move.

I'd hope we wouldn't be paying more than 10-12m for him though. I think he has two years left on his Sunderland contract, and they signed him for 6m.",0,1340121903,null,0,1340122307,0,c52nbxf,t3_v9yv1,t1_c52nbxf,t3_v9yv1,null,1429178730,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Pacheco didn't get a single first-team start for a team struggling against relegation in La Liga. That really suggests that he's possibly not good enough for us. Aquilani will probably leave, for a combination of reasons. I hope Joe Cole is shipped off permanently as well.

Selling Suarez is nonsense. He's already said he's staying with us this season, what happens beyond that we'll have to wait and see. But it would have to be a crazy good offer - upwards of 30m, at least - for us to even consider selling him.

The term ""harassment, alarm and distress"" basically needs repealing &amp;/or redefining because at present case law has allowed almost any behaviour  to be interpreted as such.

The term has been on the statute books for quite a long time, long before the public order act referenced, and courts have ruled that running, waving your arms in the air or walking erratically could be sufficient to ""cause harassment, alarm or distress"".

Pretty much anyone who has ever staggered home drunk from the pub has committed this crime, but it's obviously applied arbitrarily and capriciously by the cops as they see fit (we don't like the look of you - here's an ¬£80 fine, no judicial oversight, there's nothing you can do about it).

If you have a dispute with your buddy whilst walking down the street? Tell him, *""fuck off, mate, that's nuts!""*? You don't need to be shouting or in genuine altercation, you can be laughing and smiling, but if your voices are raised loud enough to be overheard by the little old lady sitting at a nearby bus stop, then your use of profanity could ""reasonably be construed"" to cause her ""harassment, alarm or distress"".

I can reasonably imagine an ex turning up on your doorstep or harassing you at work - yes, that's pretty clearly harassment, alarm or distress. Yet I'd be really surprised if exes and stalkers are ever prosecuted under the Public Order Act, as they could so easily be. Instead their behaviour is allowed to escalate until they show a repeated pattern of behaviour, and only then are more specific laws applied. So this is a whole bag of bollocks, being totally misused by cops who want to demonstrate their authority.

River: My mother wasn't, didn't stop you.

Jack: Mothers? I'm starting to warm up to the new you.

Doctor: She came on to me.

River: And don't get me started on Marylin Monroe.(whispers to Jack): technically I only married a robotversion of him.

Jack: Marylin Monroe, is there some secret charm hidden beneath that bowtie?

River: Who can resist a man in a bowtie?

Jack: I have to agree on that, Doctor Song. But I still miss the leather jacket.

River: You had a leather jacket?

Doctor: I was different, I had barely any hair and...

River: Can we go see the leather jacket?

Doctor: That would be crossing my own timeline. It is dangerous, irresponsible...

Jack: Embarassing?

This is a pretty common misconception among atheists. Not all religions are about a 'man in the sky' - Buddhism and Judaism both spring to mind as religions that aren't about some cosmic father figure.

The further east you go, then the line between religion and philosphy becomes more blurred and you get 'religions' like Confucianism and Shinto.

The Ancient Greeks and Romans would find our modern concept of a 'man in the sky' to be quaint as well.

Rooney is our best player, so he has to return to the side.  He'll complete the link between midfield and attack that is lacking since England use Gerrard in a more reserved role.  So the question is: Welbeck or Carroll?  It has to be Welbeck to start for numerous reasons.  He's a better all-round forward, linking up and running better.  He's developing a strong partnership with Rooney at United, and those club connections have proven to be so important for other teams (see Spain, cf. Netherlands).  Finally, I'd rather have Carroll coming off the bench than Welbeck, because Carroll's physical style and 'different option' can change a game more than Welbeck's more well rounded play.

Robben's sulking &amp; prancing after being subbed off against Germany was partly because his replacement was Kuyt.

But I tend to do have a rather apathetic opinion of democracy but frankly I'm saying as I'm sure you might say it's best of a difficult decision, where if you were given the chance would you choose an autocratic or a democrat system. My pride or support of it doesn't deny I can't argue with it at times. 


""We need a revising chamber of non-partisan wisdom to counter partisan stupidity coming from the other place. If not my suggestion then how?""
                                                                        &amp;
""So how would you fix this?""

I wouldn't and I'm not truly suggesting anything here. I'd try other approaches to deal with dominant parties, but groups have always formed in democratic systems. I'm saying there's little point in trying to avoid it by believing that a set of experts will reach a consensus so easily and even in the most difficult decisions they won't factionalise themselves or indeed get into bed with the party structure as it stands today.


""..why we need a council of the wise..""

That sounds a little bit subjective. Someone may say about ten years ago Andrew Wakefield was wise. Today we may say he's a corrupt tosser. But in the press at least he was considered an expert. A wise man seeing an esoteric connection between autism and MMR. Debateable whether in the field that was the case mind. It's a medical example I know, but it still points out that any expert is subject to personal and professional failings. Naturally this falls on the professional politicians too. Furthermore you might read it as an example of the public being stupid in believing the press, which again is a failing of democracy, that if the people aren't informed then they are liable to faults themselves in certain choices.

But anyway, my point: I hope that's just a name.

""and has achieved her status out of merit, will understand far better than the increasingly common, public-school educated MP.""

Now that's a stereotype, really there were far more public school educated MPs twenty maybe thirty years ago than there are today. I'd not dismissing hard work and graft, I'm saying aloofness is not subject to where you were taught but sometimes what it was. If they're scrutinising bills they should know what's up. And this is why I think I brought up the word ""meritocratic"" earlier in this long running debate.


""I am only advocating a Senate at national level.""

An unelected senate. That's ultimately my problem with it. Sorry fella.

""Any kind of 'popular vote' will fall prey to popularism""

Frankly I'd be concerned that any appointment won't be based on who's the most general and possibly boring as in happy with the system as current. It sounds like a job to me, probably a job interview with as much scrutiny to raise about who's going in as much as who's staying there.

But anyway, whilst I'd admire your effort to complete a counterbalance, I see as much faults in it as I do the democratic system. No offense but it's a bit idealistic.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"I chalk it up to the weirdness of time travel. For the Doctor, future knowledge doesn't necessarily bring the capacity to change that future. If he's witnessed an outcome that for some reason can't or shouldn't be avoided, and has hints on how to bring that about, he's not going to go fiddling with the details and risk screwing the whole thing up.

There's a short skit called ""Time"" made for Red Nose Day 2011 which might help you wrap your head around it. Due to a complicated string of events, the Doctor, Amy, and Rory end up interacting with their future selves. Near the beginning of the second part, the Doctor gets into a mess where events from the future are playing out to no benefit, but yet, he still has to initiate those events in the present to ensure the future they've witnessed and prevent a paradox.

I think this is why the Doctor only did what he knew his future self had done, and didn't instead try to improve upon it. He does this because he trusts his future self that if he wasn't on the right course, he would've corrected the course when his future self traveled back. Since his future self didn't pass any warnings or anything, his present self can safely assume things are going well by that point in his future self's timeline (which it has, as that future Doctor has witnessed Amy being successfully revived and released from the Pandorica).",0,1340131583,null,0,false,0,c52phml,t3_va2sz,t1_c52phml,t1_c52owcl,null,1429179746,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

However, I do agree with OP that Carroll has begun to prove himself and we need to remember that he's young.  A certain outgoing battering ram at Chelsea took a while to show his true colours.
 
I'd personally like to see Rogers build his team around Aquilani if he's willing to stay as he has come out and said today.  I'd also give Joe Cole another go after the season he's had at Lille.  Charlie Adam and Downing are quite simply awful; if we can settle two players of Aquilani and Cole's ability into the team and get them playing then we suddenly look like a more realistic threat again.
 
Sigur√∞sson appears to be as good as signed and looks a great player potentially.  I think we need someone for the right side of midfield with Kuyt gone and a clinical striker.

And there's just not much they can do about it.

* [spoiler] (/s ""When the Master turned the TARDIS into a paradox machine."")
* Shortly after the Doctor's eleventh regeneration.

Ironically, it's happened multiple times in the season that the theory refers to.

The wife was telling us how she was so worried about her husband, because he'd become withdrawn, and didn't seem aware of anyone or anything around him. That this little boy (a neighbor, I guess) came over every day and followed him around the garden, but her husband didn't seem to even see him. As we were leaving, we were telling the Ashton Kutcher companion all about it, and he was like, ""What little boy?"" And we realized that whatever was wrong with the husband must be contagious, or maybe environmental, and now Ashton was suffering from it, too.

Then the dream skipped ahead a bit, and the Doctor was calling the wife to tell her that he'd figured out what the disease was that was causing all the problems, and he'd figured out how to cure it... in himself. Turned out it was the wife, the Doctor, and I who were delusional. The little boy didn't exist. And neither did the husband.

true,imrtun,sussex,West Sussex,"I'm 23. I am also diagnosed with Aspergers, and your post scares the hell out of me. Currently I'm working as a customer service advisor in a garage, I deal with members of the public negative emotions all day long. It's my job to turn other peoples problems around, and take on their stress. As someone diagnosed with Aspergers, I couldn't be working in a more ill fitting job. Despite that, I'm bloody good at what I do, topping company KPI league tables. I have also been living on my own in rented accommodation for the past 2 years; I make less money after tax than the original poster. 

On top of all this, I don't have any GCSE's, A levels or formal qualifications of any kind. I left school when I was 14. I had to leave, due to not being able to integrate with other school children. The regular outburst and meltdowns were a huge disruption for the other kids. I isolated myself for about 18 months, never leaving the house and only leaving bed to eat.

I remember watching some program on TV one day, the subject was eye contact and autism. It was like the penny dropped. How was I meant to know to look at peoples eyes when they spoke to me? Logically, the sound came out their mouth, so why not concentrate my attention there? Nobody had ever told me different. It started me on a path to researching body language, facial expressions, speech patterns everything. I practised what I had learnt on my family, then acquaintances. Pretty soon, I had friends. I even managed to get a girlfriend. At first it felt awkward and forced like I was acting, but when I could see it working it became more natural.

The key thing however, it all requires an insurmountable effort. All this, just to pretend to function normally in society. It was exhausting.

So these days, even though I'm functioning. I wouldn't say I was exactly living. I did suffer a burnout 2 years ago and took 6 months off work. I regularly fall asleep at 7PM from exhaustion, there's no longer any hope of life outside of work, there's no energy left at the end of the day. 

I can't achieve anything. I'm deeply depressed and anxious even when things are going well for me. My PHQ-9 mood score had hovered between 21-24 for at least the past couple of years and my GAD-7 anxiety score recently topped out at 19. I'm depressed because I'm depressed more than anything, but it's certainly exacerbated knowing that it's probably impossible for me to work towards an education and better life for myself. I definitely could cope in a classroom with the progress I've made in my working life, I wish I could go back. Theoretical Physics and engineering interest me a great deal. All my colleagues tell me ""you're too good for this place"" and that I come across as intelligent. If only they knew the full extent of my struggle. The worst thing is, every day that passes, I know I'll never get to be my best version of my self. I think about suicide on an almost daily basis, I'm miserable truth be told.

I'd like to know if the benefit system is helping you in any way to try and reintegrate into what might be considered a normal life. Do they offer any resources in order for you to better live with you condition and perhaps in time a small job might be a possibility? Knowing that the work you do is valued by somebody else can be a great boost to ones self-esteem.

I know and fully appreciate that everyone's circumstances are different. Some people truly will never improve, and those people have nothing but my sincere empathy. Well as sincere as it can be coming from an aspie.

I would not say I am cured. Unless making a conscious effort, I'm pretty blind and oblivious socially. I guess my resources have been reallocated from learning and making the most of myself, to surviving and living each day as it comes. There's not really any other choice but to keep going is there? I'm not sure how long I can keep it up; but I do.

What will you do if your benefits are taken away and they deem you fit for work? It must be a stressful thought. It's funny how politicians are all praising the 3 MP's that spoke out about their mental health. Yet their taking benefits away from hundreds unable to work due to their mental health. How hypocritical.

McGonagall sent away all of the Slytherins because the vast majority of them had sided with the corrupt Hogwarts staff planted by the Death Eaters. Not only were they *students*, but the change of betrayal in midbattle was far too high. 

In the *books* it was not ""all Slytherins"" that were sent away. That was the idiotic simplified film. In the book it's a fairly simple affair of detaining all of the Death Eater sympathisers and not a ""by the House"" imprisonment.


And the key matter is that Harry was not racist against purebloods *or* Slytherins. He distrusted specific people, but in his treatment of Slughorn it's clear that not all Slytherins are bad people and Harry knows this.

It's not Harry's fault that Slytherin house has been closely tied to the Wizard KKK, Wizard Hitler, and Wizard Hitler Two. It's not his fault that the man who murdered his parents, his dick teacher, and his high school bully all are from the same house.

In the Pandorica episodes, he's interacting directly with his personal past, which is several orders of magnitude more dangerous than something like saving the life of an ""important"" historical figure.

As far as I'm aware, the only case in Nu-Who where someone has interacted with their own past and successfully changed it was when Amy helped to rescue her younger self in The Girl Who Waited, which was apparently only possible because the timestream technology being employed in that facility somehow isolated her and thus prevented the paradox from affecting the ""normal"" timeline.

In Judaism, although God is given a certain level of personification, the reality is that the idea of being 'god's people' interpreted a little differently to how you might think.

They are god's people because God is the Jews and every Jew is a part of God.

There is no easy way to explain it because the concept isn't really known in English and English is a very technical language. The best terms I can use are ['egregore'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore) and 'persistent cultural meme', but neither of them are exactly right and neither accurately describe the all-encompassing nature of Judaism.

Christians see it differently - it's more of a distant personification - but that makes sense when you consider that Christians worship the Jewish god and Christianity itself developed out of Western paganism which was based around symbols and idols.",0,1340139212,null,0,1340139435,0,c52rnj7,t3_v9qcw,t1_c52rnj7,t1_c52p3la,null,1429180773,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

EDIT: Walcott is injury prone though, which is a huge drawback...also, this is PURE fantasy, I don't see Wenger ever agreeing to this, Walcott ever desiring it, or Chelsea being very much interested in it.

I feel like I've only ever seen him come off the bench late into games we were already struggling in. I'd like to see him stay on next year as a 2nd string striker to start games Torres is injured/resting for, and to come off the bench if needed. 

Hulk would certainly add an awful lot to the team, but the the idea of paying out another near ¬£40-50m fee just gives me a bad feeling.

Again, if you're a student, house parties will be common. The reason isn't the drinking age, it's the expense of drinks at nightclubs.

As it's so close to the city centre, it's most likely an expensive place to live, so potentially living closer to Epsom would save you on travel costs for your daily commute and housing. Though I assume you have friends/family etc. living in Clapham already.

Oyster travel cards do give you pretty good savings over pay as you go if using TfL services regularly, especially if bought annually, as it works out to roughly the price of 10 month worth of monthly travel cards. Travel cards also allow you to use buses when ever you like at no extra cost, as a bus pass is part of the travel card. It may even be worth buying a zone 1 and 2 travel card even if you decide to cycle into work if you plan on using public transport regularly when you're not working so you don't have to worry too much about paying for buses or tubes around London.

Cycling would probably be your best option as you would be going against the main flow, out in the mornings and back in in the evenings, so you would provable avoid any major traffic on your side of the road. Not quite sure how true that is, I'm a train and tube commuter, but it seems to make some logical sense...

I have had some very lean years in the UK but I have never dodged any tax, as I believe that we should support each other. I know that during my upbringing I wouldn't have stood a chance without the support I got from the state, so I am more than happy to repay.

Of course we may disagree with how the tax money is used, but then it becomes a political issue.

We have it by the pint here. If you prefer light and refreshing, I would go for a reasonable lager like staropramen. Slightly heavier ones with hints of fruitiness would be Belgian wheat beers, these are delicious but expensive. Then further down the beer spectrum you have IPA's then bitters etc etc.
There are many many many local breweries so what beer you drink will vary from pub to pub.

If you want to see more of Britain, get the hell out of London. Yeah London is great. But the rest of the UK is vastly different. I love the north.

The rounds system may or may not apply, depends who you are drinking with. But you will have to go to the bar to order. Unlike everything else in the UK there is no queue. The bar staff will probably serve people they know first you will have to just wait your turn, if you wave money or generally be obnoxious they will just ignore you.

We generally don't tip at all here unless its a keep the change for a taxi or maybe 10% at most of a restaurant bill. Not leaving a tip is not frowned upon, that said, let your own discretion be your guide.

People will take the piss out of you for being a septic. It's not personal, that's how we communicate. A fag is something that is smoked. Not one of the gays.

The police here are generally pretty friendly. 

Religion is not very prevalent here. 

If your phone is unlocked and can take gsm, get a payt sim card, there are a lot of good deals out there for cheap. Or just get a cheap one from a supermarket.

If you land at Heathrow, just get the tube into town, it takes longer but its much cheaper than the other options and its an easy first taste of the tube which will become your main method of transport. Get a tube map. Learn it, so you don't look like a dopey tourist.

Much less pressure, much more conducive to his development.

Also he'd be third string, behind Torres and Sturridge.

It makes sense, too, with Kuyt performing a comparable role over the years. But in Rodgers's 4-3-3, will this be necessary?

&gt;""The Law of the Few"", or, as Gladwell states, ""The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts.""[3] According to Gladwell, economists call this the ""80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80 percent of the 'work' will be done by 20 percent of the participants.""[4] (see Pareto Principle) These people are described in the following ways:
&gt;      Connectors, are the people in a community who know large numbers of people and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who ""link us up with the world ... people with a special gift for bringing the world together.""[5] They are ""a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [... for] making friends and acquaintances"".[6]

true,ben9345,english,London,"**Travel Tips and Things to Expect** 

* Firstly if you are going to use public transport, which I expect you will, get and Oyster Card. You can get one in any station. Without an Oyster card it will cost about ¬£4 to go on a short journey. With an Oyster Card it will cost ¬£1.90. 

* Expect it to be expensive. Having never lived anywhere else its hard for me to compare but I hear that often. If you buy food in from a supermarket rather than going out you will save a lot of money and it can be quite cheap. Its going out to restaurants etc that can be expensive. 

* People are saying bring a jacket or something (which you should just in case) but it won't be raining a lot. Expect it to rain a little but most days will be OK and pretty warm if your coming from August onwards. 

* If you buy a new TV you will need a TV licence. If your staying in a hotel or something they will obviously pay it but if you are paying for your own utilities etc and you want to have a TV it needs a licence. Its ¬£145.50 for a licence. You don't need it to watch [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/), [ITV](http://www.itv.com/itvplayer/) or [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/4od) (the main networks in the UK) shows online though because its not live. If your happy to watch TV on your laptop and not live (which is what I do) like Hulu or something, you don't need one. 


**Food** - In terms of places to eat most cafes and coffee shops sell sandwiches and things. If you want restaurants Pizza Express or Prezzo, 2 chain pizza places are pretty good. When I say ""chain"" I don't mean like Pizza Hut or something they're nicer than that. Leicester Square is a nice place for food and Chinatown surrounds it so if you want Chinese food that's where. The Strand is a good road too. Its south of Leicester Square and has many restaurants on it. Most places will we good and I wouldn't ever worry about it being bad, just expensive. As I said making your own food is much much cheaper. 

**Social** - if your there through September and October all the London universities will be having Fresher's Weeks where the 18/19 year old student will have just moved to London and have 1 week or 2 to party and go out with no lectures etc. They will all be new to London and there will be some Americans who have moved to study in London. Depending on whether events are exclusive to students of a particular university you may well be able to go to Fresher's week events and meet people. I would advise talking to the student unions directly. [University College](http://uclu.org/), [King's College](http://www.kclsu.org/), [Imperial](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/) and [LSE](http://www.lsesu.com/) are the large colleges I know will be having events and i've linked each name to their student union pages. I will also be worth checking their pages on facebook where they will inform students of events going on and how to get tickets (you may well need tickets to go to certain events which is why I wonder that you *might* need to be a student at these colleges to get them unfortunately). 

* In London the universities are not campuses but spread out. When students party they don't have house parties that often and will go to a club or pub. **Be aware that most pubs close at 11 at night as do many shops.** Clubs are open all night as will most bars but pubs (which are more common) will close at 11. I have heard people comment on how everything shuts so early. It does but as long as you know where your going is open all night (as all clubs will be) your fine. 

**Drinking** Drinking etiquette is not really a thing unless your with close friends. A round is ""a drink for every member of the group"" and typically one person will buy a drink for everyone when it's their round rather than the whole group getting up. The person buying will be different every round until everyone has paid the same amount. Again its only really a thing in pubs or bars with friends. In a club or a bar with people you have only met once or a few times your pretty unlikely to come across it but if you hear people say it at least you know what they're talking about. 

**Gaming** - There are many game stores in the UK: GAME, Gamestation, HMV, Virgin Media among other smaller or local stores. Many places had midnight openings for Diablo III recently so I wouldn't worry about getting games on release. Even so I would get them online on Amazon or somewhere as its just cheaper.

However most people don't know he is a fantastically talented comedian/writer/stand up in his own right, he just doesnt do it that much of it and only did his first solo show in 2010 (although had intermittently done the comedy circuit for 20 odd years before that). Mostly doing character comedy and sketches/songs as opposed to standard stand up and it was excellent. You can buy the dvd at gofasterstripe*. 

So I've got pretty big hopes for this series.


If you are a comedy fan and dont know about, you have to go to look them up at www.gofasterstripe.com, they make dvds/downloads for stand up shows and related stuff that wouldn't otherwise be commercially viable and started up in order to film Stewart Lee's 90s Comedian which no normal dvd company would put out considering the last one hadnt sold at all and the last 20 minutes not helping much either. They have shows from Stewart Lee, Richard Herring, Simon Munnery, Wil Hodgson, Norman Lovett, Tony Law, Craig Campbell, Robin Ince, John Hegley etc etc.

Conclusion:

&gt;Doctor who is not a television program, but a social experiment conducted by the BBC to test the general publics memories.

A bonus, I've seen [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jUSw0BO8un8/T6QENBpE_sI/AAAAAAAABF8/UPD1pXzebwU/s1600/dr-who-rain.gif) gif about a hundred times. One day I happened to remember it when looking for a reaction gif. I looked it up with vague terms like ""man crying in rain"" and found it. I saw it was David Tennant. I handwaved it as just some massive British think I'd missed because I was American, but then I start the next episode on Netflix and it's THAT EPISODE. I remember it. It was the 10th Doc talking to Wilfred about how he couldn't ever let Donna know about who she really was. 

Again, I'll put it down to just missing a chunk of popular culture because I'm not a Brit, but shit's spookey man.

Yes, when I was that young, I had a huge amount of energy. I've mentioned avoidant personality disorder and the related compulsive self-reliance elsewhere. Well, I was basically so compulsively self-reliant that I more-or-less invented CBT for myself and applied it to my own avoidant personality disorder. And it worked, in a way - for a while.

The thing is that the whole point of the autonomic stress response is to allow your body (brain included) to work past their sustainable limits. At very low levels that just means you're awake, but some time you'll need to sleep. At extreme levels it's more like the neurological equivalent of it's better to pull muscles and risk serious injuries by running like an absolute loonie without being entirely sure what's around you than to be eaten by that lion that's just behind you.

But stress doesn't automatically mean fear or anxiety or anger or misery or whatever - it can be exciting and exhillarating. Mania is driven by the autonomic stress reponse. In the short term, it gives you energy and motivation in bucket-loads. The problem is what happens later.

When your stress response is out of control, one of the issues is that ""just relax"" simply doesn't work. I learned all sorts of relaxation techniques - they only worked if I was already pretty relaxed anyway. Citrus smells can help a little for me (that stress-response trigger that reacts to facial reactions and tone of voice - the amygdala - was originally a smell/taste processor, and still is - aromatherapy may actually have some basis to it).

With the stress response getting jammed on, it's better to use that energy on something constructive than to sit around letting your brain use that extra energy to try and rationalize why the stress response is still active - ie worry and trigger more stress.

For me, the real problems didn't kick in until my late twenties and early thirties. Increasingly, I couldn't sleep at all until I crashed. Just before I finally came out of work, I was having a lot of time off work because I couldn't sleep often for three, sometime four days at a time, and then I'd just crash for a day or more. During those long ""awake"" times, I really wasn't functioning well - I was burned out and not making sense, but when the stress response is jammed on hard enough that doesn't mean you can sleep.

Actually, even after years out of work, my sleep cycle is still very disrupted. Things are so out of control now that something simple, like visiting my mum or dad, means I won't be able to sleep for more than 24 hours and then I'll have a mini-crash. I don't dislike my parents - I love them, I enjoy visiting them, but that's irrelevant to the stress response.

Actually, it's the situations where I don't care that I don't get stressed, at least not as quickly. One of those little ironies - all those people who got upset because I couldn't cope with them, who felt I was personally rejecting them etc, were actually in general the people I most liked.

On the girlfriend thing, lucky you! I've worked on eye contact and active listening and things years before I even knew about aspergers. I found I could get to a certain point in the friendship thing before I ran out of acceptable personal stuff to share, or because obviously all these things *are* manipulating stuff to be more liked so it's not surprising when people feel your being manipulative. Quite a few times, I had a ""you're such a good listener"" relationship with women - I knew when to shut up and listen, what kinds of questions to ask, that the point was *not* to try and propose solutions but just to listen. So I've never had a girlfriend, but I've spent *many* hours listening to just how terrible various womens boyfriends and all those other problems. It turns out I am (or at least was) basically the kind of man many women claim they want, but other than for venting to then leaving, they really don't.

These days I'm basically in near-total solitary confinement anyway, so the whole girlfriend thing is just never going to happen.",0,1340165134,null,0,false,0,c52xymg,t3_v8eap,t1_c52xymg,t1_c52r0dh,null,1429183830,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In fact, he could easily be lying about being 200 years older(Not saying he is, as I'm not a fan of people who just jump to the conclusion of 'The Doctor lies' for *everything*). The point was to help differentiate between 'older' Doctor and 'present Doctor'.

Simply put, Doctor shows up and proudly proclaims he is 1,100 years old. Then when Amy and Rory run into him again, he once more proudly proclaims that he is 900 years old. This is an obvious age gap, and helps the two realize that they're currently talking to a much younger Doctor that hasn't 'died' yet. It also possibly is used by The Doctor to make sure Amy and Rory don't jump the gun and tell his past self about his 'death' too soon. There might be more urgency if they found out The Doctor they saw die was only a week older than the past Doctor they ran into, as opposed to a lengthy 200 years.

Either way, it's not really important to the plot. The Doctor could be 200 and 400, respectively, during the last season and it wouldn't have changed anything.

It's kinda like how I'm viewing the England vs. Ukraine game today.

Ignoring the offside call, the goal was in. England didn't protest this to the referee, even though they complained after suffering from the same bad call against Germany. They asked for goal-line technology, didn't get it, and therefore aren't going to complain if a lack of goal line technology benefits them in the future.

It's slightly different, but: Jimmy Carr makes a sketch partially to mock, partially to tell people that this is going on and it's bullshit (a lot of comedy tries to make a point as well as be funny). People don't rise up and fight it off, and then he goes on to take advantage of it himself. Financially (if this is legal) it's a very good decision to make. Morally I don't have a problem with it.

Hate the game, not the player.

My opinion on Jimmy Carr remains unchanged - a decent comedian with a bad laugh.

- Don't use British slang like mate, cheers, quid, etc. We know you mean well and all but it just sounds silly in an American accent. However long you live there, this will apply. 

- Dont be upset if someome calls you a wanker, tosser, cunt, twat, dickhead, bellend or knob. it's affectionate. Unless its a stranger off the street. 

- The weather is so unpredictable and changes rapidly. If it's a bright warm morning with beautiful blue skies, don't be fooled. It will quite probably be raining by the afternoon. It can stay nice too of course, but be prepared. 

-  Go and watch a football match. There are six Premier League clubs in London. The Premier League is the most popular in the world and football is such a massive part of the local culture. If you experience the atmosphere and get into it, you will have a) a great time because football is awesome in my humble opinion b) a talking point to start conversations and get involved in other conversations with, which will obviously help you make some local friends.

- English people are very sarcastic, and it's a subtler sarcasm than American. Be careful.

- Lastly, have a wonderful time, enjoy our great country and check out r/london!

I was hoping that there would be a fic about the Last Centurion about all the epic conquests and what not Rory had to do, like when he removed the Pandorica from the fire plus various original stories that seem along the lines of the book you pointed out. Apparently fanfic is all sex and angst though. DID YOU SEE THAT ONE LIKE 100 ""FIC"" THAT WAS JUST ABOUT RORY TOUCHING THE PANDORICA AND JERKING OFF?!!! That is not what I want to read. Granted, there are fics that are good and involve sex and dirty bits, but they have to be well-written (or use proper terms and not ""member"" and ""man-sausage.""

I think as far as Rory is concerned, the few fragments of his immortal life that he'd spend with Amy would be so enlightening and beautiful that it would make it worthwhile. I mean, he spends the rest of his life just sitting by. He might just be hoping for the best and that he may die, or the Doctor would give him some kind of mercy killing? Since he isn't immortal like Jack really is. I haven't really read any DW fics, so I wouldn't know. I didn't find any good Centurion stories or anything.

Like I said, I haven't read many fics, but there's definitely ones about the three of them, just not so sure about the title. Are you referring to the show My Boys? I've never watched it =/

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"&gt; I like your argument that it's about being a regular starter and no manager really wants to give a player that assurance - never really heard that before.

We can't know for sure what the thinking was under Dalglish/Comolli on this; all we got was [this](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/comolli-answers-your-questions) from Comolli:

&gt; With him (Aquilani) it was more a question of opportunities to play. He's obviously a big player, he's got a very good resume and he's a very good player. But Kenny and the coaching staff felt he would play in a certain position. As I told Alberto during the summer, unfortunately in that position is someone called Steven Gerrard and it would have been difficult for Alberto to play. There were different reasons. There were tactical reasons, the fact he was playing in this position and also we felt it would have been very difficult to keep him here not playing regularly.

I can see where Kenny was coming from - he wanted to get Liverpool playing his lopsided 4-4-2, meaning there were only two CM's, and ideally the first-choice CM pairing would be Gerrard &amp; Lucas; no space for Aquilani. By moving away from the 3-man midfield we had under Rafa (where, in 2009-10, the ideal first-choice CM was Gerrard in front of Lucas &amp; Aquilani), Aquilani's position disappeared; he'd have to play backup to Gerrard, and neither he nor the club (in terms of cost-effectiveness) were likely to be happy with that. In comparison, Adam would be on much lower wages and provide decent cover for Gerrard (something which isn't false; when Lucas &amp; Adam paired together at the start of the season, we played as well as we've done without Gerrard).

The issue here isn't really ""why did Kenny loan out Aqua"", but more significantly ""did Kenny change too much too soon?"" - given that the squad he inherited was highest on quality in central midfield, and in his half season as caretaker he'd primarily played a 3-man midfield with great success, and he'd have to bring in a lot of players at the same time to implement the lopsided 4-4-2, could it have been done more gradually? But I digress.

&gt; He should be hitting his best years, he's played 25 times for Milan last season (because of loan clause) and 34 times for Juventus the year before so his injury problems appear to be, for the most part, behind him. 

I'm skeptical - just like I don't give a damn how good Joe Cole looked in Lille. The reason is, both the French and Italian leagues play a much slower tempo of football with less physicality. Thus, it's definitely more likely that Aquilani would have fewer injuries. I'm not saying he'll get rolled over in the PL, but he would suffer more injuries. 

&gt; Gerrard has shown the player he is now at the Euros. He's past the stage where he can be bursting into the box every 10 minutes but he's still world class sitting a little deeper. 

That depends. I don't interpret Gerrard's impressive Euros tournament as ""Steven Gerrard's playing CM well, that's his spot from now on"", rather I see it as ""Steven Gerrard's capable of playing CM as well now if he wants"". I still maintain his best position is a more attacking brief, but he can do an all-round CM job if needed.

To be fair, Aquilani's similar - he can play both an attacking midfield role and a more all-round job (whereas Meireles was really just an all-rounder, never a proper attacking midfielder). Aquilani doesn't have to replace Gerrard, but in a 3-man midfield they can coexist.

At this point I think Aquilani's fate is sealed more out of financial reasons. Aquilani is a player on Champions League money at a club that's now into its third season without Champions League revenue. FSG aren't sugar-daddies, but Rodgers needs money to spend, and removing Aquilani's wages from the books will help immensely. I suppose he feels that Gylfi is only slightly less capable than Aquilani in Rodgers's system, but would require much lower wages.",0,1340185747,null,0,false,0,c5312xy,t3_vaibe,t1_c5312xy,t1_c530xvg,null,1429185332,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

It really depends how you measure the economic opportunity cost to say if renting is better. In the short-term there may well be a reasonable case for it.

He covers this whole aspect in The God Delusion. The Bible, if taken completely literally, is revolting, depraved and inhuman, and I don't think that anybody would argue with that. However, as you've pointed out, all Christians choose which bits to follow literally, and which to ignore. In which case, the whole existence of the Bible is redundant, because people have a deeper set of morals which prevent them from following the Bible's rules if they sense them to be wrong.

The Bible is only ever used for guidance in two situations - firstly, where someone already knows the right thing to do, and is seeking reassurance, and secondly, where its antiquated bigotry is pulled out to prop up homophobia and other intolerances.

I agree that his confrontational approach often puts people on the defensive. And if atheism were a religion, and he wanted to convert people to it, then he would take a softly-softly approach instead, play mind games with people, make them feel loved, make them feel as if atheism is the only way that they can ever be loved.

For starters,

1. The majority of drugs have LESS impact than Alcohol (I mean this in every aspect, addiction liklihood, chance to ruin your life, and even the actual effects of taking it), so why the fuck is alcohol legal if you 'care' so much?

2. If you care about how much damage drugs do to people's lives, why is it a *criminal* offence? And not a medical/social support issue?

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","When dealing with most public sector organisations in the UK - particularly one that's shown to drag its heels - you MUST keep a paper trail.

Keep photocopies of everything you give them, don't hand anything over without a signed, dated receipt, don't post anything unless it goes Special Delivery (NOT recorded), once it's been received print out and file the proof-of-delivery. When they tell you what they can/can't do for you, don't take their word for it - look up what the law says.

If you can't photocopy the documents, scan them in and keep them. 

Why? Simple. The staff are not there to help you get what you're entitled to, they're there to look for reasons that allow them to deny you - and they're remarkably good at this. They'll ""lose"" documents, give you contradictory information, give you misleading information. Whether it's incompetence or conspiracy I couldn't say, but it doesn't really matter - the result's the same.

So, how do you beat them? Simple. **You** become the one in authority, **you** lead the conversation in the direction it's meant to go in. If you've done everything I've said - and you keep it to hand - it won't be long before you can do this.

That's right, a weapon. Which is what the majority of Staffs/ Pitbull-types are obtained for....and that's before we get to Staffs being the number-one abandoned breed - again, how could this be when nobody is buying them to be weapons?

In his most recent two seasons in the first team King barely played, Kaboul wasn't nearly the player he is now and Dawson was almost as much of a liability as he was. And let's just say Gallas isn't the sort of guy to encourage a player not meeting his high standards. That was also a period during which we lacked an effective denfensive shield in midfield - the whole defensive unit in front of him was generally jittery.

Maybe if he had a chance to get comfortable behind a solid defence with consistent personnel (Vertonghen and Kaboul) he'd be able to feed on their confidence and use that as a platform to improve the side of his game that's been lacking.

We all know he's one of the few keepers in the world capable of game changing saves. If he sorts himself out and is able to gradually replace Friedel over the course of this season I'd be pretty damn happy, and it'd save us a lot of hassle in terms of finding someone new - Friedel won't go on at this level forever, much as it sometimes seems that he might.

Whether it's incompetence or conspiracy I couldn't say, but it doesn't really matter - the result's the same.

Actually, those who work within the benefits system do TRY and help you get what you want and need. Don't throw down and give your blanket of 'They're all incompetant' when they damn well aren't.

I will admit there are problems and the DWP could be so much better... just please remember that the people there are human, not all of them are bad, most of them are good... but the bad always outshine the good as tragic as that may seem.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; Besides, people don't throw money at you just because you wrote some code. There's more skills needed to make money developing software than just writing code.

If you don't write the code you have 0 chance of making anything at all.

&gt; The vast majority of people selling phone apps probably make less than they give their kids in pocket money.

&gt; The odds of me writing the next Angry Birds is zero, because that's not just about the code.

If the authors of Angry Birds took your view, their odds of writing Angry Birds would be zero. Stop being so defeatist.

&gt; I have given serious thought to making up some video tutorials, but that the gets back to the same old problem - there's far more involved in running a business than just creating something and hoping someone will pay for it.

As someone who's had two successful exits from a business, 1 failure and 1 where I gave up in the end as it wasn't worth it, I'm calling BS on this. Here's the one thing you need to have a successful business:

1. A revenue stream greater than your costs

That's it. That's all you need. Guaranteed success every time. My point is that you're currently disabled, you're suffering from a degenerative disease that clearly affects your health and wellbeing. This is an opportunity for you to do something that will keep you active and keep you going. It doesn't have to be android apps, that was just an example and the up front investment costs are only your time. Why would you think you'd need to write the next Angry Birds in order to be successful? There's very few that have been that successful, but there's plenty of people making enough money from software to earn a living. IIRC Alien Blue makes enough money to pay for the author's salary. Instapaper pays enough for Marco Arment to live reasonably. Bingo Card Creator makes enough money for Patrick McKenzie to live in Japan.

If a guy can make enough money to live in Japan selling software that makes themed bingo cards then you can find a problem, solve it and make money selling the solution too.",0,1340198761,null,0,false,0,c532k3b,t3_v8eap,t1_c532k3b,t1_c52mwzd,null,1429186064,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,lucasfuturecaptn,lfc12,,"I remember reading that Comolli interview.  Your observations on Kenny's system are interesting and I am keen to see how Rogers sets us up.

I feel like your last argument is a typical football argument though, which I am constantly baffled by.  We have an asset which cost ¬£17m (there or thereabouts depending on source) and we're basically letting somebody else get the use out of it if they cover the running costs, which we then spend half of (estimate) on an inferior asset which does the job half as well - but we also spend another ¬£7m to buy that asset.

If Aquilani is on ¬£70k/week then he costs in a year half of what Adam cost in transfer fees before we consider wages.  If Adam is on half of what Aquilani is on we can run Aquilani for 3 years rather than have Adam - by which time we might be able to justify the wages again because we have a better quality player helping us to achieve that status.

Now I realise this falls down if you assume that Adam was signed on the understanding he would not be a regular first 11 player but he certainly ended up being that (through no merit of his own I might add).

If Adam can play 35 games for Liverpool (even before missing the end of the season through injury) then so can Aquilani.  I don't buy into this French and Italian (and, to an even greater extent, German) leagues are inferior thing anymore - look at Newcastle's French contingent.  The Italian league is slower but a player of Aquilani's quality will slow the game to his pace and not try to play like Gerrard has in the past just because he's in the PL.  I say in the past because he's 32.  32 year olds don't play like that.  He showed that when he came back last season and he's currently showing at the top level how he can adapt his game for the new reality.  Just as Barnes did.  He will always be quality but we can't rely on him like we used to.  Aquilani is potentially at his peak and, if you look at Milan letting Pirlo leave as a precedent, it could be a huge mistake to just cut ties and not try to fit him in.  I think Gerrard, Aquilani and Lucas can play together in a three man midfield now Kenny has left - and he has left so it's a blank slate.  From what I've seen of Sigur√∞sson he's a good player, but he's more a long-term replacement for Gerrard than a near-term alternative for somebody like Aquilani.  Spurs' success has been orchestrated from the middle by Modric.  Utd's turnaround was as a result of Scholes coming back.  Liverpool haven't been the same since Alonso left.

Like you say, we still have a reasonably big squad.  We don't need to buy more fringe players.  Spend most of the budget on a striker and right sided player and use the rest to keep the quality we already have.  Kuyt is now off the wage bill (legend though he is), and Maxi should be too.

Devolution is not the same thing as separation. Devolution is granting jurisdiction on a subset of powers to a regional assembly.

This is a false choice. England is not a homogeneous political state, it is just governed as one. It can be recognized the politics in the north of England are different from those of Cornwall or London without seeking separation.

**From English Premier League**: 

Alejandro Faurlin. Easily the best player in QPR. Was injured around the same time as Lucas. Most tackles per game in the Premier League. Composed on the ball, good reader of the game, but lacking in pace. Needs to bulk up a bit, otherwise I think he is great.

**From Serie A**: 

Michael Bradley. Versatile player who has seen relative success playing in the Eredivisie, Bundesliga and Serie A. Not spectacular, but very consistent performer who is unlikely to disappoint. Good long shot. Will need to improve on his passing rate for Rodgers. Only American player I like, but likely to be the first American superstar.

Radja Nainggolan. Very strong and pretty quick as well. Considered one of the best DMs in Serie A in the last season. Able to attack as well as defend, has a crazy right foot. Likely to be a little costly. 

**From La Liga**: 

Gary Medel. The ultimate pitbull. What more can you say about the guy who marked Messi out of a game? The bad thing, however, is that he is dirty like fuck. Watch the cards fly and the anti-Liverpool sentiment soar with this one. 

**From Bundesliga**: 

William Kvist. Good, strong, consistent DM. Inexpensive. Nothing bad to say about him, which is a good thing.

Henderson is not the most naturally gifted footballer but he is an athlete.  He can get around the pitch and harry the opposition; similar to Scott Parker in that sense and I think that's why he's at the Euros, as his backup.

Realistically we're not going to find somebody on the cheap who will completely fill the void of Lucas and be happy to step aside whenever Lucas is available.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"That breakdown of the costs for Aquilani and Adam is great. Note, though, that Aquilani going out on loan under Dalglish probably wasn't purely for financial reasons (although that would have played a part) but also because, simply put, we couldn't guarantee him a regular first-team place now that the 3-man midfield was a 2-man midfield, and without that Aquilani most likely didn't want to be here.

(You're right about Adam ending up playing far more games than expected, but we couldn't really tell Aquilani - ""well, if Stevie gets injured you'll get a guaranteed first-team place till he's back"".) 

So again, the question isn't ""why did Kenny loan out a ¬£17m asset"", it's ""why didn't Kenny utilise a system that could make use of the ¬£17m asset"". 

I'd never suggest the French, Italian and German leagues are of inferior quality, but certainly the French &amp; Italian leagues play at a lower tempo  and players undergo less physical exertion. This is only relevant insofar as Aquilani's injury problems - he showed in his time under Rafa that he could play at the higher tempo (something Joe Cole couldn't, hence his time at Lille not being a good indicator of how he'll do for us now).

I definitely agree that Aquilani in what we're expecting to be a 3-man midfield for Rodgers would/should be a regular first-team starter, and I agree with you that he can be the attacking or the orchestrating midfielder. It's a question of whether Rodgers sees it that way. 

Although, rather than see Gylfi as a fringe player, I'd see him as an improving player - someone who we'd expect to cement a first team spot within a season or two, rather than just be a perpetual backup, i.e. Adam. Now that we're back to a 3-man midfield, replacing Aquilani with another player who is purely a backup would be a horrible mistake, I agree.",0,1340205612,null,0,false,0,c5343o8,t3_vaibe,t1_c5343o8,t1_c533sxp,null,1429186789,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

However, the most important reason we need cover for Lucas is because of his role (I'm assuming) in Rodgers side. He will act as the defensive pivot or 'water carrier'. Helping out the defence and distributing to the attacking players efficiently, holding possession when necessary. One only has to see why Busquets is given such responsibility for Barca and Spain to see how this role is crucial in the team performing smoothly. Leon Britton played this role for Swansea and completed the most passes in world football.

Spearing is incapable of this because of his passing ability and ball retention. I would have liked Diame given his age and cost but Henderson, Aquilani and Gerrard are capable of playing this role.

&gt;This is a false choice. England is not a homogeneous political state, it is just governed as one. It can be recognized the politics in the north of England are different from those of Cornwall or London without seeking separation. 

Ok so why can't I just say the same about the UK as a whole? Why can't the politics of scotland be recognised as different to wales or yorkshire without seperation?

&gt;A government that ruled an empire we no longer have. One that ignored federalism and was too inflexible to grant Irish home rule. 

Ok well I'm not asking for that. That seems to be a bit of a strawman argument. I'm just arguing against seperation, not for a new conquering empire.

&gt;Hardly an example for modern government.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt; ... If the only country that hasn't got it's own parliament is England, it sounds like England is the only one that doesn't really care too much about independance and is happy to be part of a larger picture.

Perhaps. The population of England is significantly larger than the rest of the UK combined. It can throw its weight around where necessary and not care so much if Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland diverge. There has been an interesting study released recently [The Dog Than Finally Barked- England as an emerging political community](http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/8542/the-dog-that-finally-barked-england-as-an-emerging-political-community) to suggest that this may be changing. The question is whether England is happy to continue to accept anomalies such as the [West Lothian Question] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lothian_Question) (WLQ). 

There is however a potential (and not unlikely) problem that could make the WLQ unavoidable. What if the government for the UK and the party with the most number of MPs from England differ? Could a UK government be formed and fill roles that have been completely devolved to govern England without incurring the anti-democratic backlash?

&gt; Isn't that what the local council does?

In a very restricted, small scale sense. 

&gt;Ok so why can't I just say the same about the UK as a whole? Why can't the politics of scotland be recognised as different to wales or yorkshire without seperation?

This is what devolution is in its current form, a Scottish Executive for Scotland and a Welsh Assembly for Wales. This is not separation or independence. I am arguing that devolution could be successfully implemented within England to provide a leaner government able to tailor policy to fit regional differences. The evidence for this is the Welsh and Scottish assemblies that have been great and popular successes on how local government can work.

&gt; If it aint broke don't fix it. Just because it isn't ""modern"" doesn't mean it's not good.

I would argue that its inflexibility and blind adherence to tradition is why Scottish independence is now a serious and credible possibility. It is recognized that the middle ground (some form of devolution max, in the spirit of the [Irish Home rule bills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914)) is the most popular option, but that is not being offered. In my opinion this is due to a crippling fear in Westminster to ceding any real power, a throwback to the empire days and remaking the mistakes it made with Ireland.

You may argue comparing her with Jenny is unfair since Sally actually was the focus of the episode, but strangely enough even Sally's best friend, Kathy Nightingale who got stuck in the past and whom we got to know only through several scenes and a letter is STILL a more likeable, memorable and elaborate character than Jenny.

If you are lucky they will have numbers direct to managers. The JobCentres are run in such a way that claims are processed in completely different areas to where the JobCentres are located, and you will never ever get to speak to the actual people in charge. 

A CAB or law centre will have no powers you don't, but might have some useful expertise. However if they are any good they will have regular meetings with the benefits people and will have ex-directory numbers. It can make a miraculous difference. 

Failing that keep calm and polite. Pursue the crisis loan, but you could also ask about an ""interim payment"", crisis loans are paid back week on week once your benefit starts, interim payments are advances of benefit that will be taken out of the lump sum backdate when a decision is finally made. However in both cases you'll need to be fairly advance in showing you have a claim - crisis loans won't be paid unless they believe you'll be able to pay them back in the foreseeable future which normally means anticipating benefit payments. 

They also have a formal complaints process. Consider making one. They can be remarkably frustrating to deal with, but they aren't all idiots. I've dealt with some very competent managers etc. and if you can make a complaint that may mean someone more senior will look into what is happening. 

Give them everything they ask for - even if you've given it to them before. It'll be quicker. Again a CAB/law centre may be able to fax or email them directly to someone with actual power.

true,twist3dl0gic,tardis,TARDIS,"How so? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but he's not obligated to wear Doctor Who as a badge of honor just because he once had the role. Eccleston had certain expectations of what working with the cast and crew would be like, and they were not met. I don't think he's ever accused any of them of outlandish behavior, merely sighted creative differences. Just because he's pretty open about not agreeing with the producers and isn't falling on his knees kissing their feet doesn't mean he's being petty or stupid about the role. 

I realize that all of us, the fans of the show, would kill to be on the show and be apart of the club, but he's an actor doing a job. Have you loved all of your jobs? Have you never complained about any of them? Have you had people constantly question you about a job you hated that you had to act like you were super proud to be there? 

Clearly, he's not thinking of the show's fan or his own fans when he says he'll never return, but he's been saying that for years now, and also, plenty of other people in the entertainment business have said ""Screw the fans, I'll do what I want"" but I hardly ever see any outrage about them. I dislike Beyonce for this reason; a few years ago, her fans were outraged by a fur coat or fur trimming she wore that her mother designed for her. Basically, the singer came out with a statement that said she's grateful for her fans, but she's more grateful for her mother's hard work and she'll continue to wear the outfits her mother designs. To me, that's a giant middle finger to the fans - but it's not petty or stupid. She's not doing it to spite the fans. She's not doing it because she believes no animals were hurt in the process. She's just doing it because she knows she can. Obivously it hasn't affected her career at all.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Perhaps. The population of England is significantly larger than the rest of the UK combined. It can throw its weight around where necessary and not care so much if Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland diverge.

Perhaps this is the bit where we disagree, because to me it isn't really that important. We're all part of the UK, the fact that there isn't universal opinion within the UK is natural. I don't really see the need to divide it up into ""England throwing it's weight around"" any more than I need to divide it into ""Manchester throwing it's weight around"". I've never heard of the West Lothian Question before, and it is indeed an interesting one, but I again don't see why it would have to be England when it could just as easily be North England and South England.

I think there is some merit to the idea, and perhaps England *should* have it's own parliament to balance out the others; but I think that is a step in the wrong direction. I'd rather see the UK unified rather than fractured. Like mentioned elsewhere: it adds another level of beurocracy that I think we could just do without.

It's not about saving ¬£200 in one go.... and again, you're going for a mid-level or second hand phone in that case. Most people tend to go for the latest phones, not ones 2 years old. And even then, you probably wouldn't be paying ¬£35 a month.

&gt;I'm sure you have already justified to yourself that you don't want to move.

See, you make assumptions based on my responses without actually understanding the point I'm making. I'm responding to...

&gt;Why isn't everyone on giffgaff!?

I intend to move to either GiffGaff or something similar once my contract period is up in a couple of months as I don't particularly care for a new phone. But could I have got a new iPhone 4 2 years ago for ¬£250 without said contract? 

Bare with me, I'm going to try some maths.... (seriously, point out any glaring cock up I've made in my maths!)


The iPhone 4S and Galaxy S3 cost ¬£500, which over 24 months is ¬£21 a month. So take that away from Orange's ¬£36 a month contract (Panther Extra 36), means that you're paying ¬£15 a month for the service. Then if I sell my iPhone 4 for ¬£175 ([but could easily get more, with a snazzy case](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Apple-iPhone-4-16GB-Black-Orange-Smartphone-/190693141887?pt=UK_Mobile_Phones&amp;hash=item2c66326d7f#ht_500wt_1413)), ¬£50 to cover the upfront charge on Orange leaving ¬£125, spread over 24 months is approx ¬£5... and so overall I would be paying roughly ¬£10 a month for the service with no need to wait until I've saved ¬£500. 

Now, obviously it's not always that simple with any add-ons, insurance, bonuses, Orange Wednesdays etc, but the point is that you don't save a huge amount if you are aiming for a top end phone (ie. the most popular ones), if anything at all.

So....

It's a bit of a patchwork affair I'm afraid. There are no Coroners Reports avaliable online (apart from major 'public interest' ones, like Jean Charles De Menezez or similar), rather the records are held by local Coroners Offices. 

The complete records of an Inquest are only avaliable to ['Properly Interested Persons'](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/626/coroners/3460/the_work_of_the_coroner/15). To gain access to these records, called the Notes of Evidence, you must apply to the relevant Coroners Office, and usually pay a small fee. 

Direct Gov have a booklet on [Coroners an Inquests](http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_185904.pdf),  if you're interested in more about how Inquests work. 

However, finding the Notes of Evidence may be a little tricky if you don't know where and when the Inquest happened. The [Conorers Society of England and Wales](http://www.coronersociety.org.uk/) website maintains a list of Coroners in England and Wales, so it may be worth contacting your local Coroner(s) to see if they conducted the inquest. Alternatively try the [Coroners Court Support Service](http://www.coronerscourtssupportservice.org.uk/), who may be able to point you in the right direction. Finally, the Hospital may have records, or at least should know the result of the Inquest and where/when it was performed, allthough I'm not sure how helpful they would be, especially if they were found to be at fault.

I must admit Im in two minds about drugs. 

People who say they are morally wrong are just silly.
People who say that there is no reason at all to have them crimalized are just silly.

Some drugs will absolutly ruin you. Although the people in r/trees will tell you otherwise, smoking cannabis is hardly a safe thing to do as as far I know It is often mixed with tobaccco. A lot of these drugs a highly addictive. For example, its well know that morphine (A derivative of opium, the same stuff heroin is made from) Has to have limits on self admisitration clickers in hosptial, as other wise people will just drug themsleves to death.

With the NHS I feel its definitely the responability of the government to restrict harmful drug use that will cost everybody money and cause people serious harm, socially, mentally, physically, and financially (You know, the reasons why insurance is a legal requirement to drive). At the same time, adults should be able to do what they want within reason as long as they are responsible. A lot of people use drugs as a self-medication for their problems, so are these people responsible to use drugs? I would say no, if they think thats the option to take.

However, as the adviser points out, we need to treat this people, using cognative and drug therapy in order to be more porgessive, rather than treating these people as lepers.

We're told of common ways people steal from self-serve in our training, and if we spot these to tell the security guard; he can then only stop the customer when they are about to leave the store. The guard also has a podium near the exit where he can watch CCTV. Yeah, it doesn't seem much, but apparently one guy manages to catch loads of people. Although I only work there part-time, I've managed to see three or four thieves running out the store being chased by security, it's pretty funny.

I haven't ever heard the result of someone being prosecuted, so I wouldn't know. I do know from checkouts that rarely items can be priced incorrectly, but I've never seen an item go through as a different product. If it did, it would *probably* be a fault across all the stores. If you're going to claim that you accidentally put through your apples as bananas, you'd probably have more of a case than trying to claim your ridiculously expensive wine did.
