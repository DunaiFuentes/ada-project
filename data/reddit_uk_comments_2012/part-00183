  - Buy a car that isn't typically associated with boy racers. This immediately excludes Corsas, Astras, Fiestas and probably Saxos.

Can you back that up? I know a tiny minority of Jews who support Israel's actions in relation to Palestine. Can you back up that ""the overwhelming majority of Jews support an alarmingly racist worldview"". I personally take offence at being considered 'alarmingly racist' because, you see, use of that kind of language is in and of itself 'alarmingly racist'. 

But, then again, you might just consider this to be part of 'the difficulty with Jewish culture'.

I'll go through this pretty slowly. Deliberately causing offense is a necessity to having free and functional debate. Attacking beliefs that people hold extremely close, such as religious faith, for some people is itself offensive. Anything at all blasphemous can be extremely upsetting for them. Should I restrict my speech because it offends them? No, because we can only make progress by having a society which is open to free and functional dialogue. 

Some could say that challenging their faith is offensive, but if their faith is used to support things I disagree with (such as preventing gay marriage, the pro-life stance or the death penalty) then I can't challenge them because it may be offensive. 

With your example, for the first part they are within their rights. I disagree with them, but my goal is not to restrict this speech. I believe by voicing these opinions these ideas can be tackled. What would lead a person to the conclusion that veterans of WWII deserved the death and injury they suffered? By allowing these views to be espoused that can be tackled intelligently.

It was, that was the point. You can't make an intelligent rebuttal against it, I was being a total dick. That is after all pretty much my point.

&gt; Deliberately causing offense is a necessity to having free and functional debate.

No, it isn't. There's a difference between having a consenting debate and actually offending someone. If you genuinely believe that ""I'm not muslim and don't agree with the Koran"" will seriously offend someone *you should not be saying it*, not should you be trying to have a debate with someone of a closed mind *unless they have consented*.

&gt;  I believe by voicing these opinions these ideas can be tackled. What would lead a person to the conclusion that veterans of WWII deserved the death and injury they suffered?

There's a huge difference between 'voicing these opinions' and shouting them at a group of non consenting people in a public place. This is the difference you seem to constantly be minimising.

&gt; The second part is slander, and is a libel matter. Slander is not protected speech, hasn't been for a long time. Slander is dangerous as it allows defamation of an opposition with no evidence.

If you have a car that for some reason seems to be involved in a disproportionate number of accidents, they might add a bit more on.

Once all these sums are complete, the number you're left with is your insurance premium.
 - It's entirely up to the insurer to decide what figure they start with and how much to add or take away for each answer; the questions they ask you are standardised but how they treat your answers is not.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"1. Yes, pretty much instantaneously.  Mostly unconscious.  


2. I don't know about that - hate is probably too strong.  There was certainly an historical period when people from the established (middle to upper) middle class didn't really approve of those from the aspirational middle class, who in turn were very superior towards those in the lower middle class.  There was even a certain amount of contempt floating around, and much of the desperate differentiation on trivialities was buried in linguistic codes (did you say [sofa or settee, napkin or serviette, what or pardon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_and_non-U_English) etc.).  The critically acclaimed Play For Today, [Abigail's Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzUNCuOQem4) addresses it pretty well.


3. Probably, though it's not like class has gone away, it's just morphed, and weird things have happened like ""working class chic"", particularly bands/singers/celebrities pretending to be more working class than they are, alongside the vilification of ""chavs"".


4. No.  I'm worried about what they get up to with their peers like any parent, but I'm quite aware that upper class kids can be just as destructive an influence as the poorest kids on the block and both can be a force for good.

She was trying to advance herself and get into University, whilst supporting herself and a young child.

The only way to bring down your premium from everybody elses should be by PROVING your ability in tests/courses.

I also think the driving test sytem is broken (You remember a certain protocol for a few lessons...apply it for an hour and then drive how you want).

The driving test proves NOTHING about somebodies ability. There should be an initial test and then a compulsory safe driving course every 12 months. THAT is the only way to make Britains roads safer...Not by putting prices so high that the roads are empty.

you don't buy a new car - service it once and hope it stays in one piece...You service it regularly and regulate its condition.

true,makeinstall,null,null,"Let me elaborate because you obviously think that I'm being, at best, lacking of compassion, and at worst, callous.

Thatcher, throughout her her political career, followed a doctrine that poverty was self inflicted and at the height of her power, was surrounded by men who were drinking hard at the well of US neo-conservatism, itself inspired by Ayn Rand's flawed philosophy that selfishness was good and the true path to pursue while altruism was for the weak and stupid.

She reaps now entirely what she has sown: she is not surrounded by compassionate, loving family and friends that nurse her in twilight years of her life, as she suffers dementia and failing health, but, as you say, by paid armed guards with very few visitors. 

I do not wish ill on her, nor do I revel in what her life and health have become but I cannot muster a single gram of sympathy for someone who, when they had the opportunity and power to make life better for the majority, chose to benefit the few at great expense of the many backed with such vicious moralising invective, now reaps exactly what they sowed.

My sympathy lies with others, like the families of the victims of Hillsborough who were disgustingly besmirched by Thatcher and her cronies, who only now are beginning to see some kind of justice for their lost loved ones. It lies with the communities who depended on the coal and steel industries that she wrecked and then sold overseas at vast profit to some, that even now have still not recovered. It lies with those who pay through the nose for services from nationalised industries that were privatised in the name of financial efficiency such as British Rail, an industry that now operates with 5 times the subsidy as when it was in national hands. It lies with those who died at the hands of terrible dictators that she so happily courted and sucked up to.

I don't feel anger or vitriol at a frail, frightened woman at the end of her life but I also have no sympathy as she sits frightened and bewildered in her opulent, gilded lonely cage paid for by honest, hard working people, some whose lives ended in a similar fashion to as hers is now but with the added terrors of cold and hunger, that came as a result of policies she pursued.

At 21 in a VW Golf, you're a stereotypical boy racer, and you are more likely to have a crash. You can't argue with the numbers. 

Insurance will come down significantly when you're 25. 

Regarding the injury side of things, it covers you, your passengers, and anyone else you injure. Imagine if you had this 'vehicle only' insurance, then were the cause of a major crash... paralysing your friend, what then? 

They have to have round the clock care, move to a bungalow, have hundreds of thousands of pounds of equipment, just to get by. You're liable, but (I'm generalising now) you're a 21 year old scouser, you've got nothing. So your mate has a shitty life because you couldn't afford proper insurance but felt you were somehow entitled to drive. 

Driving is a privilege, not a right. Insurance is, quite literally, the price we pay. 

You say insurance companies should do this and should do that. Why *should* they? They don't care about you as an individual, they care about the stats, and the stats show that you're a significantly higher risk than someone else. 

You have to *earn* better insurance. I'm 34, married, with a child, live in South London, and I drive a 3.0l V6 limited edition Alfa (insurance group 37, I think).

I do think though alot of the problem is people see the car as a minimum form of transport, apposed to a luxury form of transport. But there's no real reason not the be like the Netherlands (esp in town and city's) where 25% of all journey are by bike.

As for public transport - I agree 1000% Its a joke in this country. I grew up in the sticks - we have two buses a day, one in the morning and one that returned in the afternoon. It was ridiculous.

I've mixed feelings about cops generally for obvious political reasons - they defend private property and enforce capitalist law - but setting all that aside, they're mostly reasonable working class people with jobs to do to make their bills, who try to be reasonable about it much of the time.  There are bad cops, just like there are bad boiler service engineers, although the former have more power and therefore the bad ones can cause more mayhem, but all in all, most of the time I can live with them.  Sometimes we even agree that a police response is necessary. Oh, I've even had police help with getting people acquitted, or agree with some direct actions, and many agree the war on drugs is a disaster.  So I'm anti-police as a top down hierarchical authoritarian institution of capitalism, but police officers come in all shades.

On the other hand, the TSG is like the political wing of the police ""service"", and seriously, fuck them all.  There might be the odd guy or girl who ended up in them by mistake, but for the most part they chose that line of work because they're fascist wannabes or if they didn't, they left pretty damn quick because they found out that's what the group, at heart, represent.

Overall we want a police force that listens to criticism and strives to improve, but if you're going to beat them over the head (excuse the pun) over use of force then it seems a little unfair to castigate them for listening to that complaint.

I don't feel good about taking a talented youngster and wasting time on a promising career by misusing and under-utilizing him. He is showing that he deserves more opportunities. His attitude and work rate and demeanor are among the best in our squad.

Furthermore, the selfishness of our other players is hurting his ability to actually do what he's best at. If Bale is going to take every FK regardless of angle, why did we buy a FK specialist?

I feel very bad for him because he's not a Giovani dos Santos; he has a great attitude and he's doing well when he gets his chances. I want to believe this isn't going unnoticed by our manager, but I honestly have no clue what to think about AVB at times.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Well I suppose we're only going on anecdotal evidence here, but Brown and Blair get no support whatsoever where I live or with the people I talk to. 

I would agree locally - Cornwall is not at all pro Labour (IMO if only the rest of the country thought that way), it's a two way fight between the Lib Dems and Conservatives (with even the local nationalist party rivaling Labour's share of the vote). But I am basing it from what I read on the internet, people in real life who don't live near me, etc.

&gt; Sainthood? Where do you get that impression?

A lot of people have forgotten what Labour got up to while in government, the people who consider Brown some sort of financial genius despite it all being about debt, deficit and spin (""global financial crisis"" yes, but the UK was and is a leading financial centre and Brown was responsible for the government policy when it comes to controlling it). 

I see that some people want Labour to come back in assuming that they'd reverse the cuts, even though Darling himself said they'd cut ""deeper than Thatcher"" and there's no way Balls (repulsive man) would get away with doing nothing for long. 

&gt; Labour appears to be trying to push themselves away from the Brown/Blair era, New Labour isn't in anymore.

I would agree, but when almost all of the front bench seems to be ex-New Labour stooges, including the Leader and Deputy Leader (a minister for equality whose husband made it to the top of an all women shortlist for a constituency candidacy, hmm) there's no way they are truly moving away. They need a full cleansing of the ranks, not just getting rid of Brown and hoping for the best.

History is going to look kindly towards Blair and Brown and yet people will still bang on about ""Fatcher"" 50 years after she died and after Labour had 13 years to sort it out and did bugger all apart from helping out their key marginals and heartlands.",1,1356198141,null,0,1356198581,0,c7kn27a,t3_159qww,t1_c7kn27a,t1_c7kmzbn,null,1435655426,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Surely that's a two-way street - union militancy doesn't get anyone anywhere. Look at British Leyland - they produced shit products when the workforce weren't on strike over the smallest thing. No wonder people bought elsewhere.

You can also argue that too much power corrupts both sides. Bob Crow of the RMT and similar unions in the rail industry, for example. Rail workers know they are practically irreplaceable and that a strike would be very costly and damaging, so they get excellent pay and conditions as nearly always the rail operators bend over. Great for the employees, not so good for the fare paying majority, many of whom don't earn anywhere near the same amount (privatisation arguments aside, is there really any excuse for things like demanding and getting bonuses on top of an already great salary just for doing your job over the Olympics?)

EDIT: Another example - television. You had unions striking over the tiniest thing. Not poor working conditions, or low pay, or a health and safety aspect, but because the BBC or ITV company had bought some new equipment and they wanted more money just to operate it or just to get incredible pay rises (35 percent in one instance according to one article). http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/thames/strikeout",0,1356198302,null,0,1356210336,0,c7kn3i0,t3_159qww,t1_c7kn3i0,t1_c7kjuul,null,1430744939,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

1. A 4-3-3 usually utilizes one defensive midfielder, one box-to-box midfielder, and one attacking midfielder.

Two defensive mids might work against United or City, but is commonly regarded as too defensive and would quite possible result in too many draws against weaker teams. 

2. Livermore has looked particularly poor this season when asked to partner with Sandro and try to be a more possession based midfielder. See all his appearances in the beginning of this year.

true,SwingYaGucciRag,lfc12,,"**Suarez**- was quiet for a long time but glad he got that goal

**Suso**- was surprising on the right and did his job well

**Downing**- Super assist, always looked to cut in and have a go, beautiful finish after some dreadful defending from Fulham and could have had a second from an absolute rocket. My **MOTM**

**Shelvey**- lively and unlucky not to score

**Gerrard**- absolutely majestic today, excellent distribution, took his goal really well, unlucky not to get a second near the end 

**Lucas**- solid as usual, made lots of tackles and deserved a rest at the end

**Enrique**- beast on the left hardly put a foot wrong all game and wonderful work to assist Suarez at the end

**Skrtel**- beast in defence and what a volley! Coates would be proud

**Agger**- excellent at the back but been watching too much Gervinho, appalling miss

**Johnson**- excellent getting up and providing width, unlucky not to score on his left, good game

**Reina**- barely had anything to do but was solid with some excellent saves near the end

**Sterling** Good running when he came on and almost had a goal, good cameo

**Allen** Couple of nice passes, didn't have much of an effect

**Carra** Not even sure if he got a touch

Overall, great game, fun to watch, but Fulham made it far easier than it should have been. Still, not complaining, good win right before Christmas",0,1356205089,null,0,false,0,c7konyp,t3_15aig4,t1_c7konyp,t3_15aig4,null,1430745749,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Will contain happiness and try to give an assessment on our players today.

Reina - Nothing much for him to do, distributed well, good save on that free kick at the end, the post may have knocked it back into the danger area.

Skrtel - That first goal was so instrumental in terms of how we played. I thought we were going to play like how we always did - threaten the goal so hard in the first 10 minutes and slowly start letting our opponents back into the game. But Skrtel was there to give us the momentum, well done! Also, solid defending as always.

Agger - Should have had two goals in the first half today, one from the Downing corner where he had a free header and that contender (likely winner) for miss of the season.

Enrique - Very well played. Got forward very well to receive passes from Gerrard (who had an exceptional game) and got a great assist at the end. Very good game.

Johnson - Enrique-ish, but maybe produced a little less impact. Connected well with Downing at times, but sometimes it just seemed like they couldn't read each other well enough and just gave the ball away. Good game overall, still.

Lucas - Clean job, Berbatov was forced to literally walk around with the ball when he had it, because Lucas was covering him so well. Good game.

Gerrard - Oh man, bloody good game right here. One assist, one goal, had a part to play in the last goal, absolutely brilliant at spreading the ball wide and lovely runs in and out. MoTM for me.

Downing - Very close second for MoTM. He would have been if he connected better with Johnson. Looked like an absolutely new player, every time he cut in for a shot it looked dangerous. Who the heck is this guy?

Suso - Looked a bit lost in the first half and nervous, but picked it up in the second half, especially defensively. Okay game, should have perhaps done more but might be due to lack of playing time recently.

Shelvey - Threatening and lively. Ran around, pulled defenders away, but just can't seem to put the ball in the net. Forgettable but quite important in the setup we're playing, we need someone like him to make runs while Borini's injured.

Suarez - Selflessly gave quite a few good balls to his teammates, but unfortunately none of them finished it (reverse pass to Suso on the left, and another to Shelvey on the left, as examples). Had his goal coming, thought he would have put it in during that free kick but I just knew he would score, even after that free kick. He had that hunger for the ball and eye for the goal, chased down defenders and brought the ball forward well. Well played.

Not gonna touch on the subs, though.

Overall, good play from our team, but let's be honest, Fulham were horrible this game. We should have gotten like, 7-8 goals if we we could actually finish. I hope we don't get all too happy again and get hammered against Stoke.

The midfield was much more organized this go around. Lucas did well winning tackles in Fulham's. Gerrard looked up for it after the loss last weekend and shelvey looked promising and probably could of had a goal if Agger hadn't booted it to the moon.

Suso looked comfortable but showed his lack of experience at points committing some unnecessary fouls. Had a chance but pulled it wide. Downing actually looked great today.

The further you go down the scale, the likeliness of having good table manners, being polite etc. seem to go down, especially when you get to the underclass (fat women wearing vests/tight shirts, smoking fag ends, with rusting cars on the driveway, shouting loudly at their children in public).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; BT were handed the telephone monopoly with insufficient regulatory oversight

Seems like that's been sorted out now - local loop unbundling, price controls, open access to buildings, plant, cabinets, the works. This isn't a failing of privatisation, but a failing of government - the organisation you think is infallible. If the GPO had remained there'd still be a need for fair and open access to their network by third parties, so there'd be the same ""insufficient regulatory oversight"".

&gt; BT were handed the telephone monopoly with insufficient regulatory oversight, and consequently delayed the rollout of ASDL by years so they could make short-term profits from leased lines and ISDN. The consequent cumulative negative effect of the depressed UK tech industry must be in the hundreds of billions of pounds.

Finding information is hard, but it appears that the US telcos started offering proper, full scale ADSL service in 1998. BT started doing it in 2000. That's not really a huge gap. It seems like they've finally realised that they can't do that anymore - they've pulled their finger out their ass and started offering ADSL2+, VDSL and FTTP.

Remember also that 128k ISDN was not the bottleneck it would have been even 5 or 6 years ago. It was still possible to get plenty done.

As for ""the negative effect"" that is purely your opinion so I won't bother trying to pick it apart.

Personally I am not convinced that had the GPO remained, that we'd somehow have had things move on quicker. The move to digital switching didn't really start gaining pace until BT was formed and privatised, so I don't think they'd be the same with other technologies.

&gt; But, hey, it was a bit faster to get a landline in the 80s, so it was a success, right?

We have cheap services, we have competition and choice, I'm not forced to be with one company for my phone and internet services. That's not bad. The telephone network desperately needed investment and BT did it.

Anyway, if you want to start introducing hearsay, you could argue that the GPO's huge delay in providing phone service was in itself a very negative thing.",0,1356208736,null,0,1356210861,0,c7kpia3,t3_159qww,t1_c7kpia3,t1_c7kp9nn,null,1430746138,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

This means there are 2 things that could happen: 1.they will attack when the lights blink, or 2.attack the silence if the lights are on and their shadows are touching. Once the silence aren't there to look at the angels, they unfreeze, and become edible, so they must stay in the light. I imagine they are able to talk to each-other, and they know that as soon as the lights blink, they will be devoured. Knowing what their fate, they discuss the options back-to-back. They realize that, with so many numbers, it would be impossible to get rid of all the nerada before the nerada were to eat them. There is no visible way to escape. The options for them, it seems, are to (a)sit there until the light flickers and be eaten or (b) look at each-other and turn to stone for all eternity (I like to think they choose b because that would make a really good scene)+(Other angels could notice they're absence and go looking for them. Upon seeing the two staring at each-other, an angel finds something to put between them, turns around, and reaching back, places the item between their faces, blocking the sight of one another. The last thing the two remember is being in a room where they were about to be eaten, realizing someone is there, they look at who saved them which freezes the guy for a second, realizing it's a fellow angel, they turn around to allow him to move. They stand back-to-back-to back in the room thanking the rescuer and the rescuer asking what happened. The lights have been flickering, so it's clear the nerada have left long ago in search of something that's edible.)

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"1. Yes, absolutely. Their accent, their attire and their mannerisms allow me to make a snap judgement within a few seconds. That will tell me what class they *are.* More detailed information such as educational background, place of residence, occupation, choice of supermarket and so forth will tell me what class they or their parents aspire for them to be. The difference between someone who was born in to generations of money and someone whose parents became rich during their childhood is something I would notice, whereas I think a non-Brit wouldn't. The tell-tale could be as trivial as how they eat their soup. It's not conscious, no more than telling someone's gender or race. 

2. Some people exhibit snobbery or inverse-snobbery, some don't. It depends a lot on where you live, in areas that are more segregated, where the well off and the more deprived don't mix mistrust and resentment is liable to take hold. You don't see that so much in Bristol I think because it's such a compact city so people mix a great deal and have social networks that stretch across class boundaries. Having said that, it is definitely the case that most people of my class, upper working class, negatively judge those in the lower or middle working classes who do not aspire to our slightly more elevated station. For example, when conversing with my lower working class acquaintances I'll tend to put on a modified-PR accent and tone down regionalisms and colloquialisms and generally try to set a good example of the sort of language codes they ought to emulate in order to fit in more comfortably in middle class environments. By contrast, when with middle class acquaintances, I'll often do the opposite and exaggerate regional and colloquial elements of my speech in order to signify that despite any signs that I may be middle class, I most definitely am not. I'm not either a lower-middle or a middle-middle so I can only give you my impression, which is that these are the groups which seem to most concerned with distinguishing themselves from each other. 'Sainbury's keeps the scum out of waitrose' being an example of the attitude. But being British people are generally too polite to express this burning hatred by anything more extreme than a tut or under-breath muttering. 

3. I think it's about equal but older people are more aware of it. I'd say people of my generation (late 20s) and younger tend to make judgements about people based on where they shop, where they went to school, where their parents lived etc. all elements of class, but they wouldn't necessarily realise that they are making class judgements. 

4. No. I would be worried if any future child of mine only had friends from one class though, I have a range of friends from all elements of the spectrum and my own family background encompasses the whole range from workhouse orphans to minor nobility. I wouldn't want any child of mine to be prejudiced, but I would be mindful if they were spending time in deprived areas of the risks involved with that, such as exposure to crime. But the fear of them spending too much time with 'posher' friends and forgetting their roots would worry me as well.

You are a bit vague on what you want to do...seems 'anything but work in a warehouse.'

If this is the case, it would be a good idea to narrow it down to a few sectors, look for entry level work doing administrative or similar tasks, and work your way up from there.

It isn't so easy as getting on a 'training' scheme, as most of these in the UK tend to be for graduates.  Rightly or wrongly, you will have to start a lot lower down without a degree.  But if you're just looking for a change, and willing to put in hard work, get your foot in the door somewhere doing something entry level and you could make a lot of it if you enjoy it.

*The water* - lovely and soft for washing and great for drinking.  Beats the living daylights out of most of the rest of the UK, and if you've ever spent an amount of time in a country where you can't drink the water at all, you come to appreciate that we're very lucky to have something we just take for granted.

*The milk* - this might sound silly but honestly, it's super tasty.  Lazy old cows with tons of well-watered grass to feed on means it's better than you'll find just about anywhere this side of the Alps.  People in NI drink milk far more than in the rest of the UK and I think it's because it's just so damn tasty.

*Having your family close by* - When I go back now the thing that strikes me is how close everybody is to their extended families.  We're always in and out of each other's houses for a wee cuppa tay in a way that just doesn't happen elsewhere in the UK.  I know we all think our family's a pain in the backside half the time but when I go back now I just find the closeness striking.  We might not always be good at community, but we are good at family.

*Space* - it's underpopulated so there's tons of it.  Decent houses are very affordable, and having a garden to sunbathe in and a driveway to park your car on is a thing many people take for granted, but many a Londoner on a six-figure wage can't dream of having.

And as has been said elsewhere, it's beautiful.

Sadly, this didn't happen until the early 2000s rather than a decade earlier before it could do damage. Oftel was a joke.

The government failed by privatising BT in a way that was poorly-thought-out, short-sighted and driven by a painfully simplistic liberal ideology. I am tired of it being used as a canonical example of a ""successful"" privatisation when it is, at best, debatable and, at worst, disasterous. I find it utterly inexplicable that you seem to believe that I think government is ""infallible"" given that I am providing an example of where I thought government failed.

BT hampered Internet adoption at every turn in the 90s. Dial-up (and BBS access) was prohibitively expensive compared to the US for years due to call charges. They finally relented, initially by gaving their own ISP, BT Internet, unlimited free calls in an attempt to kill 3rd party ISPs. BT then delayed the rollout of ADSL to profit from expensive ISDN and leased lines. ISDN was a lot slower than ADSL, less convenient, was prohibitively expensive and wasn't targetted at end-users. BT eventually relented on ADSL and was dog-slow to roll it out. UK broadband rollout, takeup and speeds were notoriously slow throughout the early 2000s.

BT may have only been 2 years later than the US on paper, but 2 year is a long time in the technology industry, slow rollout meant it was, in practice, much longer and the US had the competitive pressure of cable broadband, which never received widespread UK penetration.

Basically, BT was a horror show in the mid-to-late-90s and there was no alternative to their monopoly, so something went badly wrong somewhere.

Do I know for certain that a nationalised BT wouldn't have had the same problems? No. I have my doubts, though, because they wouldn't have had any incentive to drag their heels. I think the government would have pushed Internet connectivity much more aggressively had BT been nationalised, made it a priority and given it a subisidy, which would have led to quicker rollout and better connectivity today, even if it cost the public more in the short-term. The privatisation allowed politicians to wash their hands of a basic infrastructure issue.

Do I know for certain that the UK tech industry would be stronger? No, but the UK tech industry is undoubtedly extremely weak, and failed to capitalise on the Internet boom. I think the BT's lagging Internet policy is a major contributory factor, along with the negative impact of the banking industry on innovation.",0,1356219703,null,0,1356220359,0,c7krygg,t3_159qww,t1_c7krygg,t1_c7kpia3,null,1430747305,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Holy shit. Just, really. I cannot wait for the next episode, it's going to be huge. 

And this episode, I liked it. I mean, the way to take away magic was a bit dumb. And how they got all the main characters to show where they were and their parts was nice and all but they don't have the time to really play it out as well as it should be.

But this episode was great. I liked seeing Merlin's dad again, and was a little pleased Kilgara wasn't the fall back no matter how much Dragons are awesome. And now I have a feeling that Arthur already knows Merlin's had magic and has kept it to himself this whole time. BUT I'm still outraged about what Arthur said to Merlin when he said he wouldn't be going with him.

Question. Has Mordred always had his own dragon fire fortified sword like Excalibur? I don't remember this, but I hope it fails if that's what they were trying to get at.

true,RetiredExec,null,null,"So, for moment lets forget about the roles you've had in the past, and focus on what you 'really' want to do. 

Lets say you want to work in Marketing. Come up with a list of local (or further afield) businesses that you want to work for. 

Swindon is kind of well located for logistics. It hosts some large contracts for many major UK retailers, dealing with return logistics, warehousing solutions and operations. Among these there will also be several independent businesses that want to promote, advertise and develop business. 

These are the companies to look for locally. 

Don't set your targets too high. Whilst planning now for a senior role, or even a junior one outside of your current experience is not off the cards, we need to be realistic about what your options are. Scout job boards, research local businesses and develop your CV to showcase the skills that you built and used in your warehousing roles. 
Your **skills** remember, not your *duties*. 

There are many transferable skills between roles, even if you can't immediately see them. 

Find a job description that you're interested in and challenge yourself to truthfully develop a CV based on your skills, that would get you an interview. 
 You don't have to use it, but just try it. 

Career paths have a strange 'buddy system' of promotion, unless your uniquely placed for a specific role, you're more likely to get it when you know someone. 

Begin some networking, chat to people in your chosen field, aim to get a role that places you well for your ideal career and go for that.

Choosing a job now doesn't necessarily mean finding the perfect job now, more lining up a planned future, 1-2 years, 3-5 years and so on. 

Sit down, write where you want to be in 5 years, and plan for that. Maybe your plan is to become the marketing manager for Tesco (this is an example BTW), you may find that years 1-2 of your plan means working the shop floor in a supermarket, working the tills, operating at the back, whilst still remembering your 5 year goal and aiming for the next step of that. 

I scribbled this down on my phone. Maybe it's. formatted badly or a bit all over the place. Let me know what your initial thoughts are.

true,ThePhlogist,null,null,"Here's an idea. Fuck networks, fuck the BBC America channel. The BBC can afford to be a trend setter in this area seeing as this is merely one smaller arm of the company. Close the BBC America channel and offer an ad supported (maybe 2 ads every 15 minutes - less than Hulu, Comedy Central and most other US online content which is normally every 10 minutes), subscription based service independent of all networks like Hulu. Make it $5.99 or $6.99 a month so as to beat hulu on price. As 5 or $6.99 doesn't = the licence fee I think it would only be fair to limit the service so: No live streaming, pay a couple of extra dollars ($3-5 with larger prices for events that last days or weeks?) when the time comes for big events like the football or rugby world cups and sports games in general, Royal weddings etc (Kerching!) and maybe cover US events like NFL (which I think is covered occasionally anyway) or Thanksgiving/4th July etc and charge extra for those. It will be worth it for British events where the BBC will have much much better access than US competitors. It will also be one of the only places in America you will be able to get constant updates about the Premier League which will go down well as I think football is getting more popular in the US since their women got to the final and their men beat England in the world cup. Also no downloading via the desktop app because this will be ad supported so we want people to watch the ads. Also we're more intelligent than the movie industry so there won't be any delays on premiers so as to discourage pirating or finding a different copy on YT which is easy to do for Americans ATM. 

All of that added together I think would make a competitive and lucrative offer for people in the US who like QI, Dr Who, Sherlock and those types of shows but also sports nuts who can get unparalleled access to UK sport especially football for much less money than a cable package with ESPN. Also you can target UK expats who miss UK TV and sport. People in the US will stop using their absolutely extortionate cable companies in a few years and the BBC can be at the forefront of encouraging people to do so (and buy the BBC in the process).

The reaction of the police in general - to protect the police officer who killed that harmless person.

Bad apple? Special case? No - there's plenty of similar cases if you look. The particular officers who commit these crimes may be rare, especially if you focus particularly on killing, but the way the police force deals with it is systematic.

When the system is set up to protect those police who act criminally, when those who don't actively participate in the cover-up at least turn a blind eye, I have to say that actually yes, the police are collectively responsible for murder and other crimes. They all choose to wear the colours, they seem OK about accepting the credit for the good things other police have done, if they don't do anything to prevent it they equally deserve to share in the criticism for the bad.

Still unfair to say it the way I did? Maybe. But don't forget that this mostly-peaceful protest in which one police officer was injured, yet over 180 protesters made formal complaints about injuries caused by the police, was described by Boris Johnson as ""an orgy of cop bashing"", and representatives of the police made some similar statements. If the authorities are allowed to lie, I don't see why I shouldn't exaggerate.

[A common misconception is that being 'healthy' means being 'sporty'](http://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/the-bbc-confuse-being-healthy-with-being-sporty/).

It was widely considered (when car ownership was less widespread prior to the 1970's) that it was very manageable to cycle distances up to 10 miles. This was of course when cycling was predominantly utility based and sports cycling was a niche sport, unlike today where the misconception is that all cyclists are 'lycra clad road warriors', and that to cycle you are required to have lots of safety gear and ""special clothing"".

Back in the early 1980's, the GLC implemented a policy called [Fares Fair](http://www.bilderberg.org/farefare.htm) that resulted in an immediate drop in the number of vehicles on the road, accompanied with a drop in road accidents. After the policy was overturned in the Law Lords.... 

&gt;*In the following financial year London ratepayers' contribution to public transport rose 35% from £208m to £281m, though reducing the cost to the public had been Diplock's purpose in ruling Fares Fair illegal.

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"I respect your opinion but I believe there is a lot wrong with this.

&gt;He couldn't make Liverpool's second string, but now (after just one good year BTW) we want him back?

He was an 18 year old kid who could have stayed and worked his way into the team but actually had the balls to leave and go make a name for himself elsewhere. Like pointed out below he was offered a sweet contract for a reserve player.  1.5 years can make a huge difference for young players. Remember Shelvey from 1.5 years ago? Remember Suso or Sterling from 1.5 years ago? They have all improved immensely, monumentally so when given first team football exposure kinda like Ince has had at Blackpool.

&gt;Also, I'm tired of the inflation of the value of British players. This egocentric kind of thinking that overestimates the talent and strength of players in England

The overpricing of English players has more to do with the homegrown rules.  It drives up their price as they become more of a necessary commodity.

&gt;Mind you, the last player we got from Blackpool: Charlie ""Hollywood-Ball"" Adam was sold after just one season

This is just silly reasoning. Buying one bad player doesn't make another bad.  

&gt; Tom Ince, as is not reported often, is a selfish player. 

I'm not gonna lie to you and say I'm a Tom Ince expert or that I've really sat down and watched him other than highlights but the kids stats are 13 goals and 9 assists. Call me crazy but 9 assists doesn't seem selfish. By comparison [Gerrard has the highest assists](http://www.anfield-online.co.uk/stats/12-13/lfc-stats.html) with 6, Suarez with 4. I know it is a different level but the kid gets assists showing he knows how to make that final pass, something we quite often can lack.

&gt;Also, why not give Pacheco a chance before we buy crap players like Tom Ince?

Pacheco has had chances come and go under 4 different managers. If 4 different managers can't find a way to make him play well in the team it isn't happening. Rodgers came in and saw how good Sterling and Suso are and now they're in the first team. If Pacheco was good enough he would be in the first team, but he isn't. He won't be and I bet he'll be gone within a year.

&gt; I truly believe a player like Nem could become world class. Strange enough, he's worth only £7M.

Anyone who has played Football Manager 2013 can tell you he is a boss player but there is a lot to go into just picking a player and transfering them.  How is his attitude? How well can he adjust to England? **Has he played enough games for his national team to qualify for a work permit?** Will he ask for silly wages? Can he adapt to the quicker, more physical premier league? With those questions in mind £7M can become quite a risk. 

&gt;For more on on this glorious gem of a player, I'll refer you to Max Towle on Bleacher Report.

Never link/read Bleacher Report.  Anyone can make an account and hype up any player to no end.

Surely that just means the police have even less excuses to rationalize their criminal behaviour. They don't have to face the same dangers that other police do, yet they still feel the need to victimize defenceless people.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I take it you haven't watched Gylfi a lot other than this season, because he's at the very least Bale's equal at free kicks. Gareth does his fancy Ronaldo stance and knuckleball but he's incredibly feast or famine. Gylfi tests the keeper at an alarming rate with his free kicks. I suspect if you added up how many goals each has scored from free kicks over the last 3-4 seasons the Icelander would win in a landslide.

And even if we were to say Bale is slightly better at free kicks (he isn't) , he's not better to the point where he should be taking them even at an impossible angle. The kick he took today was pathetically selfish and far more talented FK specialists would have required something incredibly special.[ It was perfectly set up for this](http://youtu.be/eylefTUOK6w?t=40s). Instead we got an inevitable smash into the wall. No justification for it at all. 

As for dropping JD Ade or Dempsey, I'd say there has been plenty of opportunities to do just that. Ade and Defoe as a pairing has been absolute shit with few exceptions. It particularly cramps Adebayor's style who is much better playing by himself. Furthermore neither of those players have scored in several weeks and both are in poor form. Dempsey somehow stayed in the team in spite being absolute garbage for months, fortunately finding form eventually. 

15-20 mins per game is absolutely ridiculous particularly when the players being preferred are in garbage form. Gylfi was rightly dropped when he was struggling, why shouldn't Defoe or Adebayor be held to the same standard? These guys wouldn't even take risks or get into the box or try to get on the end of crosses. Both of them were standing around doing nothing expecting the ball to feet for half the fucking match, and they are entitled to stay on why exactly? 

The fact that he came on and did more than either of them in 1/9th the time seems to justify the idea that he should have been on far earlier. And if we start with the same garbage 4-4-2 against Villa....well...I just hope he's not pandering to the idiot fans who think that formation is the solution to everything. It worked exactly one time against fucking MARIBOR and suddenly we need to do it or else we're being negative. Just madness.

That he would be stuck in a cave with no way in or out, no resources to survive, and with the full knowledge that as he lay there Arthur is in a losing battle that would end with him being killed and Camelot falling.

having said that I can see a few shots that look like they've been through the mixer - a few bits of minor HDR here and there - quite a few with the high contrast black and white look. I personally don't have a problem with things like this - for the most part Photoshop and Lightroom have only made traditional darkroom techniques easier for the layman - I don't think that there are many techniques you can do in photoshop that you can't do with some 35mm film, an enlarger and the knowledge of how to use it.

true,BoltenMoron,num11,,"No I have only seen him this year and last year and a few videos here and there but I do recognise his skill as a free kick taker. I do agree, Bale can be selfish when taking free kicks, however this season, Bale has impressed me a bit more with his free kicks (that being said, Gylfi hasn't been given much of a chance). I have no doubt that Gylfi has more DFK goals than Bale, but then again, try moving VdV off a dead ball.

I agree, the two strikers formula is not working and i would prefer we play a 4-2-3-1. 4-4-2 worked because Bale and Lennon were deeper and ran at defenders, playing the higher up does not allow this and without a creative midfielder on the field, it is difficult to pick out their runs in behind the lines.

I am not prepared to say Defoe is out of form, he has 13 goals this season (3 games without scoring is not uncommon for a striker, if he doesn't score by NY then I would call that a slump). Ade provides the hold up play that we need, he hasn't been a prolific goal scorer this season but his ability to provide an outlet prevents build up of pressure and to create opportunities for the advanced trio behind him. Also, Ade has had what 3-4 full PL games after an injury, I would prefer to give him time over Defoe at this stage.

I really want to see Gylfi in behind Adebayor for a game or two to see how they would pair up. His creativity would allow Bale and Lennon to get in behind the back line and he can put away knockdowns if we have to resort to longball. That being said, would you put Gylfi in over Dempsey now that he has found form?

Take the lack of Enrique appreciation after yesterday's game as a compliment - people have now come to *expect* this level of domination from him. The huge outpouring about Downing today is because it really came out of nowhere, surprised all of us, and was 1.5 years in the making. 

I don't know if you were on this sub when Enrique first joined, but until his decline in form in the second half of last season he was widely seen as the second best piece of transfer business we did under Kenny after Suarez - and that hasn't changed, really.

There certainly isn't an English bias on this subreddit - if anything, most of us are concerned that the club keeps buying English players.

I not only rate him as a great striker but as one of the most underrated strikers in the league and in my personal belief, 12m is an absolute steal.

For the first time in a long time we have a manger thats looking at the player rather than the name, the record and the price tag.

It annoys me when people use his time at chelsea to rate him.

Chelsea is NO place for young talent to progress and develop, not when they have an unlimited spending budget, no player is safe and no spot is guaranteed. Not only was he never guaranteed to play but he has always been played out of position on the wing. In the centre he's amassed an impressive number of goals despite his limited playing time and frustration with the club. 

The other argument I hear is '*he's selfish, we have no need for a player like that in this team*' Well, lets ship off Suarez then.. I have NO problem with players that are selfish if there effective, we forgive Suarez selfishness because he's effective I believe Sturridge will be to, at chelsea he's had to be in order to get any kind of attention.

I think he could be the next Thierry Henry. Henry played on the wing for Juventus and then went to Arsenal and played as a centre forward and was very effective, I think Daniel could be of similar impact if he links up well with the team but this is all speculation.

------------

edit: not **LITERATELY** the next Henry but similar in playing style and effectiveness in his style of play, not to mention when played out in our system the results should be very beneficial, the same way that Arsenals style of play matched Henry's strength and allowed him to shine ",0,1356267580,null,0,1356286868,0,c7l03ax,t3_15boq4,t1_c7l03ax,t3_15boq4,null,1430751199,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"I created this graphic but didn't want to post this on /r/Soccer because of the butthurt you will soon face. The truth stings, here are the replies you are going to get soon:

- 1) **Not a good comparison, Cazorla is a different kind of player.**

Not true. Cazorla has played every single game as a CAM, he is not playing deep and not providing anymore defensive cover than Mata and is providing much less defensive cover than Silva. So basically he is in the middle of nowhere, not good enough in defense, blown out of the water going upfornt by Mata.

- 2) **Cazorla contributes to so much more than just goals and assists.**

Not true again. Chance created for a CAM or a small, creative midfielder regardless of them playing deep or not is very important. Even if you are not assisting you need to create chances and he is ranked as #11 in the league as a chance creator. More importantly both Mata and Silva have played the Cazorla role on several occasions and done just as good if not better than him. Cazorla on the other hand has not even tried a different position apart from rotating during a match for a minute or two.

- 3) **Santi deserves a shot, he is the oldest, even if Mata or Silva are better he should get a shot before he goes into his 30's and starts getting pension.** (An Arsenal fan will get this kind of comment to the top)

Again the bias speaking. There is no reason to give any player a chance based purely on sentiment. As long as both Silva and Mata are better than him they should get a chance ahead of him regardless of his age.

- 4) **Mata and Silva should not be compared with Cazorla because he is playing the Modric role, when did  Modric ever represent on the stats?.**

Again not true. Modric was magnificent in his deeper role and his work rate, defensive contribution, providing help to every single team mate and being available for every single pass is the reason Madrid signed him. They could have swooped up Cazorla for half the price if they wanted to but there is a reason they didn't bother. Cazorla is not that player, anything he can do Mata and Silva can do better - That is the bottom line. But the things that Mata and Silva can do, Cazorla has only done in 2 games this season against bottom table sides. You will see that Mata and Silva are always running around trying to make themselves available to help out the team, Cazorla on the other hand passes the ball and then just strolls around for a while. You will rarely see him in top sprint apart from when he is passed the ball or has the ball, if Modric was doing all of this then he would have been shown the finger by everyone.

- 5) **Cazorla is playing in a bad team and still t3h b3st**

Again false. The reason Cazorla is so overrated is the reason he is in a mediocre team. Chelsea and City have much much better players than Arsenal and to shine in that kind of environment requires balls. Heck Silva still isn't in the top 3 in form City players right now and look at his performances and stats. More importantly Chelsea are fourteenth form wise with talented players so basically you've got great players but shit results and the quality not translating onto the table which completely ruins your facts. Because Mata would have had more clear cut opportunities utilized was he in City, he would have had a better passing percentage, a better assist ratio as he would have a striker etcetera. Cazorla on the other hand is in a team in better form than City which is why he is even getting close to the other two in terms of stats.",0,1356273480,null,0,false,0,c7l0r41,t3_15bpyz,t1_c7l0r41,t1_c7l0hhv,null,1430751512,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

I have a theory. 

The world ended on the 21st of December 2012. It was demolished by the Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Unfortunately, a smart-ass alien named Zaphod Beeblebrox foiled the evil plans of a consortium of philosophers and managed to get a planetary engineer by the name of Slartibartfast to create a duplicate copy of Earth (or Earth Mark II) from the backups. Unfortunately, the backups were partially corrupted and the Torres in the backup was not the same as the Torres that existed up and prior to 21st December 2012.

Nevertheless, the Earth Mark 2 was activated and continued from the moment before the Vogons were first spotted.

what I was referring too was Arsenal's style of play played to all of Henry strengths making him a very effective player.

I believe that Liverpools style of play and Sturridge style would be equally effective, hence he could be the next Henry a player who's true potential and talent only really came into full force at Arsenal because of these deciding factors (he did well at Juve but Arsenal was were he really hit full force).

That would be ***fucking awesome.*** But they'd have to be careful to make it different enough from River's storyline, with her young self being manipulated into a weapon sent against the Doctor.

I don't think the Time Agency itself should be the ones setting Jack up as a villain, that would be too similar. Have we ever gotten a real sense of who/what the Time Agency is? I know they were mentioned in Classic!Who too, but I mostly know about them from the [**TARDIS Wiki**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Agency). Maybe they're associated with the Teselecta, hunting down and punishing historical criminals?

I'd like to see the Time Agency being the ""good guys,"" or at least a relatively neutral organization, and Jack as a formerly good agent going dangerously rogue. Captain John would probably be involved, and holy crap could that be hot.

Captain John is to Jack what the Master is to the Doctor. Jack's got some serious PTSD problems of his own, and John could manipulate his emotional trauma and his pre-Doctor tendency towards being a seductive, somewhat amoral con artist into full-on fucked upness. Maybe without Jack even fully realizing what he's participating in until it's too late. Maybe targeting the Time Agency itself in revenge for something, or a plan that looks like a regular ambitious con job but which ends up endangering the planet/universe/fabric of reality.

Maybe it wasn't even actually the Time Agency that wiped his memory. Maybe it was the Doctor. Hell, maybe Jack asked him to do it.",0,1356291408,null,0,1356292205,0,c7l4kah,t3_15bgmv,t1_c7l4kah,t1_c7l0e80,null,1430753382,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,mexican_alien,lfc68,,"&gt;What's going well

We are currently in a rebuilding mode. So, can't complaint much. After the decline in last few seasons,our ambition is now limited to achieving a spot in Europe or take a shot at top four if possible. With that in mind, and considering the striker situation, I'd say we are doing decently. Our form has improved a lot compared to the start of the season. From being sitting near the relegation table for long we are now 5 points away from fourth (our GD is horrid though). Another good thing is young players like Sterling who are playing well and showing signs that we can plan the future around them.

&gt;what isn't

We don't have a decent striker other than Suarez.

I don't see we signing any big name come January.

There are few players who we need to off load (Joe Cole for example), because they are on insane wages (which effects prospects of signing new players) and has little to show for that.

An uncertainty regarding BR's new system. Of course we are playing more attractively and results are getting better, but we are still not at a point where we can say that he is the one to move us forward. Not that he's disappointed or anything, he just needs to prove it in longer term.

**Icke says [Satanism﻿ &amp; Human Sacrifice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW7-UskI3To), goes on at the Royal residences of Sandringham and Balmoral, that Sir Jimmy Savile went to morgues across England to access the bodies of dead children, and was up to his neck in the Haut de la Garenne affair.**

&gt;[Prinzowhales @ cbsnews.com](http://www.cbsnews.com/8601-202_162-3168637-2.html?assetTypeId=30&amp;blogId=) says, re an allegedly spurious beheading in Iraq, ""the blood?--I've been soaked by geysers from femorals--whatever they cut, it wasn't the carotid of a living human being.""

&gt;[Guardian.co.uk says](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/29/jimmy-savile-behaviour-prince-charles) .. a spokesman confirmed, the Prince of Wales [had] a relationship with Savile from the late 1970's onward, after both met thru their work with wheelchair sports charities.

&gt;Postulate Savile brought the wheelchair kids to Sandringham and Balmoral, according to Icke's testimony, where after they were slaughtered in rituals presided over by HRH, as per Prinzowhales @ CBS News!

Whilst either school is capable of providing a good education, both will turn out morons occasionally, and an education of the same quality can be gained elsewhere. There is an added danger, with any public school, of gaining a child/employee who is either insufferable or just plain weird.

Are you looking to hire someone or to send your child to a school which will improve their future job prospects?

If you are hiring, ignore the school name - it is not that relevant to you, the applicants have got what they were going to out of it.

If it is your child you are asking for, bear in mind that there are other schools just as good, easier to get into, and less expensive. 

Reputation is the only real reason to pick either one of those, and the reputation they have is only really stellar, I understand, outside the UK - there are negatives associated with both schools in Britain.

true,Teotwawki69,capaldi,Capaldi,"A lot of the original series were never actually saved or released intact. Rather, four or six episode story arcs from particular seasons wound up on home video, for a lot of reasons. 

First was that many of the original series episodes were lost when the BBC erased the original tapes. Another reasons was that a lot of the original series ran huge numbers of episodes -- over 40 per series early on, into the 20s up until the 6th Doctor. 

Since very early video tape could hold, at most, two hours, it was much easier to release the shows in sets of two or four tapes covering a particular story line, rather than to release the whole thing. 

I don't know whether every single existing episode was released to home video once it became a thing, but I also imagine that only small neighborhood video stores would have bothered to stock entire sets of single episodes if they had the demand for it.

It seems to be mandatory to state that any team who won played well. It was a particular disgrace last week that we lost 1-3 against a side who played poorly. Fulham were very poor on Saturday and Liverpool were decent, but not fantastic. But of course, I have absolutely no qualms with playing 'just' decent and winning 4-0.

Saying that, I do disagree with the sentiment that sometimes appears which values 'playing well' above winning. Winning is the aim of the game. No one is going to do well in a league without that idea as a priority. Too often are Liverpool supporters (and staff) willing to dismiss defeats/draws as unfair and insist that we 'played well/deserved more'. It's all well and good to look for positives, of course. But days like saturday when I believe we can play better (and will have to in order to beat better teams) but still get the points are very, very welcome and provide a special feeling. I seem to be arguing with myself here. Basically, I don't think Villa were great last week or Liverpool this week, but converting and taking points against weak sides is a fresh and welcome experience.",0,1356314278,null,0,false,0,c7la0ks,t3_15chb3,t1_c7la0ks,t3_15chb3,null,1430755952,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Angry-Australian,lfc50,,"&gt; What's going well, what isn't? How does that come so?

To trace our current problems back to their cause would probably be more of a Liverpool history lesson of the last 5 years than a discussion of current events. So I'm not sure how much detail you want or how interested in that you are, but I'll try a simplified overview;

* 2006/07 season saw the takeover of the club by two American businessmen: Hicks &amp; Gillette. Rafa Benitez (currently of Chelsea) was our coach at that point since the 2004/05 season, and led us to the Champions League final in both 2005 and 2007. 2005 we won, 2007 we lost.
* Following the Champions League defeat, Rafa questions the transfer policy of Hicks &amp; Gillette. Now, the problems and affect H&amp;G had on this club is a whole other discussion. The major problems were harshly restricting Rafa in the transfer market (after the first transfer window), making lofty promises and never following through including building a new stadium, spending over a hundred million pounds (?) on it's development despite *never starting construction*, and saddling the club with enormous debt.
* Despite that, we narrowly finish second in the Premier League in 2008/09. However, in 2009/10 we finish seventh in the league and Rafa Benitez is sacked. By now the club debt is a huge concern and we are facing administration/bankruptcy if a buyer cannot be found, despite Hicks &amp; Gilette refusing to relinquish their stake in the club. In the end, the situation is resolved by the takeover of John W Henry's Fenway Sports Group.
* Since FSG took over in 2010, we've regressed even further due to personnel leftover from the previous regime and poor descion making. 2010-11 saw a big decline under the coach and players left behind (Roy Hodgson and mediocre players like Christian Poulsen, Paul Konchesky, Milan Jovanovic) which saw FSG make their first big decision in sacking Hodgson and appointing Kenny Dalglish as caretaker, club legend and EPL winning player and manager from the 70s to early 90s, who manages to salvage the season and finish 6th landing him the job permanently for the next few seasons. However, his next season sets us back significantly by squandering over 100 million pounds on players who can only manage an 8th place EPL finish. This practice of overspending saddles the club with overpaid average players and a reputation for overpaying/being weak in negotiation. Kenny loses his job and FSG hire Brendan Rodgers for the start of the current season.

So, fast forward 2 years from FSG's takeover and we're finally on the way up with the necessary elements to run a successful football club; good owners willing to invest, a forward thinking coach, a massive loyal fanbase and the skeleton of a top squad. I guess you could say we've on a downward slope for 5+ years now, and now that we've stopped the descent it's quite difficult to get back up that mountain. We've not only regressed in that time, but a new powerhouse in Manchester City has established itself, Tottenham Hotspur has grown a lot, and despite their relative regressions too Manchester United and Arsenal have still retained their status up there.

It should be said that right up until 2010 we were always around the top 4 places in the Premier League, and not just competing but challenging for the Champion's League. We weren't just an Arsenal in the CL; we were legitimately a force that other teams feared. It's this tradition of success ingrained in our history, along with an enormous worldwide fanbase of the best fans in the world, that contributes to our stature that we never lost in these troubled years. It allowed us to sign players like Luis Suarez and retain players like Steven Gerrard, Daniel Agger, Pepe Reina, Martin Skrtel, Glen Johnson, etc even in those terrible times. So even though our reputation isn't what it once was, thats still a massive positive for us.

So uhh, this turned into much more of a history lesson than I planned. Hope it helps though, and welcome to the family!

true,Cx4Storm,null,null,"I've heard Llorente mentioned, as well as Bony and even Demba Ba. The problem now is that we either sell Torres and buy two strikers or buy one and keep Torres. 

Lukaku has stated he wants to stay at West Brom and continue to get consistent first team football and that seems sensible to me. From all reports he is doing well there and is improving quite well. It would be wasteful to recall him just to fill Sturridge's role as bench warmer.

If we buy Falcao I can't see him and Torres being in the team together. Falcao is one of the very best in the world right now and should be starting as many games as possible. I doubt Torres would want to spend as much time on the bench as he did last season so he would go either in this coming window or in the summer.

Someone like Remy or Llorente would work better if we keep Torres and rotate them. Sturridge has been injured quite a lot this season so Torres has played the vast majority of games and eventually he will need a rest. I can see a proper rotation of Torres and another striker working without upsetting either one.

Personally I hope we see Falcao in blue. He is an absolute gun striker and with the service of midfield I think he will be phenomenal. Torres is starting to show glimpses of his old self and his header last night was top shelf, but if he goes missing again once the window has closed we could end up without any silverware at all.

TL;DR Falcao + another (Ba maybe) and sell Torres, or keep Torres and buy another striker of similar quality and rotate them. Llorente, Bony, Ba possibilities.",0,1356315576,null,0,false,0,c7labws,t3_15cp2n,t1_c7labws,t3_15cp2n,null,1430756106,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Financing, as always, is half the problem.

In an ideal world, falling house prices would hurt people who want to downsize (most likely the elderly and hard-up) and help those upsizing or buying for the first time.

If you buy a house at £200k, and want to move to a house previously on the market for  £325k, then you would have had to raise £125k. If house prices have dropped 20% across the board though, your house is now worth £160k and your new house should be on the market for £260k... so now you only have to raise £100k. 

The problem for people moving up the ladder when house prices fall is banks will demand much higher deposits and interest rates.

He made his intentions pretty clear with that statement. He may not have said a new deal is imminent, but it's clear that Rodgers wants Gerrard around for a while. 

We'll see if he continues to be a starting player for us in the future, but I'm genuinely shocked, and impressed, that Gerrard has been able to play every minute of the PL this year. Hopefully he can continue to take care of his body like this, to help prolong his career.

&gt;Obama has sworn fealty to Israel - His campaign manager Axelrod, is tied to the Israeli agent Rahm Emmanuel, the Israeli Defence Force veteran who is a Representative for a district in Chicago, who ran the Congressional Election campaign for the Democrats, and made sure that anti war candidates didn't get the support from the party.

&gt;Obama's foreign policy handler Ziggy Brzezinski thought that America needed a new Pearl Harbor to rally people to war, he got it on 9-11, when elements in the Regime and their Israeli accomplices carried out the false flag attack on America.

&gt;9-11 was an inside job! The biggest conspiracy theory is the official fable of 9-11 in which 19 Arabs who could not fly jetliners, seven of whom are still living, rammed planes into the WTC and Pentagon.

**The FBI has admitted that they have no case against bin Laden for 9-11...they don''t even want him for it on their website.**

&gt;They cleaned up around the Kennedy assassination...they cleaned up around the Clintons... around OKC.. these people murdered a police officer...Officer Yeakey who knew too much and was looking too closely at the real perpetrators of the April 19 attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;Before World War I was launched, the bankers needed a credit mechanism to create the credit necessary to wage the war...and, conveniently, they also passed a Income Tax Amendment to give the power to the banker regime the ability to tax incomes, to pay for the ''loans'' that Uncle Sucker would need to wage war.

&gt;Look at the lowest income earners in America, the bulk of whose income goes to food, transportation and housing...the official inflation figures...like the official story of 9-11, comes from the same crock of feces.

**Yet this Regime promotes free trade with nations whose daily wages are less than the hourly wages of our workers .. why are we at war in Iraq and Afghanistan?**

&gt;Why does the CIA need to try and fly 5.5 tons of cocaine into the United States?

Suarez had a fantastic relationship with Maxi for his vision and ability to react, Bellamy for his insane pace and direct approach which opened holes for Suarez, and Kuyt, with whom the two would just run around the 18 yard box playing balls off each other like it was FIFA 11.

And that is what I love about Sturridge. He has great vision and can make a quick pass through the line, is quick on his feet and loves to take players on directly, and also loves to drift both deep and wide, creating movement for his teammates.

He's also 7-10 years younger than those players.

&gt;Obama has sworn fealty to Israel - His campaign manager Axelrod, is tied to the Israeli agent Rahm Emmanuel, the Israeli Defence Force veteran who is a Representative for a district in Chicago, who ran the Congressional Election campaign for the Democrats, and made sure that anti war candidates didn't get the support from the party.

&gt;Obama's foreign policy handler Ziggy Brzezinski thought that America needed a new Pearl Harbor to rally people to war, he got it on 9-11, when elements in the Regime and their Israeli accomplices carried out the false flag attack on America.

&gt;9-11 was an inside job! The biggest conspiracy theory is the official fable of 9-11 in which 19 Arabs who could not fly jetliners, seven of whom are still living, rammed planes into the WTC and Pentagon.

**The FBI has admitted that they have no case against bin Laden for 9-11...they don''t even want him for it on their website.**

&gt;They cleaned up around the Kennedy assassination...they cleaned up around the Clintons... around OKC.. these people murdered a police officer...Officer Yeakey who knew too much and was looking too closely at the real perpetrators of the April 19 attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;Before World War I was launched, the bankers needed a credit mechanism to create the credit necessary to wage the war...and, conveniently, they also passed a Income Tax Amendment to give the power to the banker regime the ability to tax incomes, to pay for the ''loans'' that Uncle Sucker would need to wage war.

&gt;Look at the lowest income earners in America, the bulk of whose income goes to food, transportation and housing...the official inflation figures...like the official story of 9-11, comes from the same crock of feces.

**Yet this Regime promotes free trade with nations whose daily wages are less than the hourly wages of our workers .. why are we at war in Iraq and Afghanistan?**

&gt;Why does the CIA need to try and fly 5.5 tons of cocaine into the United States?

Two reasons why.

Defoe NEEDS to be dropped to the bench for a game or two to see this. Defoe wastes way too many chances for Spurs, and it's time that AVB saw that and tried to play Adebayor up front by himself.


- Secondly, Ade hasn't got a lot of continuous time on the pitch. It's all been in patches and riddles with injuries and suspensions, he simply hasn't got into his flow as yet.

Furthermore I'd argue that the 11th incarnation is not darker or more evil than the 10th. They've both had dark moments because they're both the same troubled guy. It's only after the Time War that he's realized he's the kind of person who would let the end justify the means, even if it means committing genocide. He hasn't been getting darker with each regeneration, he's always had that side to him. The only difference is he now knows what he's capable of doing, and frankly it frightens him.

Regardless, the clip you showed is a terrible example because he totally is referring to himself as how the Daleks see him. There's many more clips of previous incarnations doing far worse things, this clip is hardly evidence of him getting darker at all.

As far as the ultimate question goes, there's tons of theories as to what the implications mean.

Dembele has taken the onus of being the creative midfielder, and while he's big, strong and has a trick or two and a good pass up his sleeve, it's not really his natural game.
