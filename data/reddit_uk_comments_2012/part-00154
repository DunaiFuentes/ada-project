Dalglish never had the luxury to bench Downing after a poor game, as we were so short on wingers. It's the same reason why Hendo featured virtually every PL game even though he was largely ineffective. 

On top of this, we're fans. We don't know what happens behind the scenes. Perhaps Assaidi was shitty in training this week? Perhaps Downing showed a more professional attitude? Who knows.

If you put aside your own jingoism you'd see that they were, the numbers don't lie.

The Nazi's failed to wipe out the Jews, Britain succeeded in wiping out or marginalizing many communities around the world. If you showed a Brit a photo [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg) they'd probably assume it was a Nazi camp instead of one of their own.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt;  and see that Germany killed more closely to 12million, JUST in detention camps.

The 10 million figure was for just one conflict in India. Add in the Boer War camps and we even out. Then consider the Middle East, North America and Australia. Add to that the opium-pushing wars in Asia and we are well ahead. 

&gt; Another point is what good ever came out of the nazi's? How did any country benefit from occupation? We brought technological advancement to other countries too. 

That's quite a disturbing train of thought IMHO. We didn't build the railroads in India to help them as a people, we did it purely to make the stripping of their resources more efficient. Nothing we did was for anyone else's benefit but our own.

&gt;  British colonists had no 'evil agenda', where we wanted to wipe out full nationalities and races. 

To an extent we did, I saw your comment in the other thread  on this and considered replying but didn't because it was a bit ""stalky"". However, we did not have much regard for ""the natives"" where ever we were and we had no problem with systematically wiping them out on several continents. We didn't do it for the hell of it, we did limit our attacks to those who opposed us; those who did were slated for outright elimination of the group as a whole. However, under the perverted Nazi logic they were doing much the same thing against the ""Jewish conspiracy"" they believed in. 

&gt;  I had no idea even 100,000 Indian soldiers officially died.

That's the problem here, the true extent of the British Empire will never be taught in our schools except to those who specialise in history. Most people come out of the system viewing the British Empire as benign. We don't know the half of it. 

&gt; The article says the number of 10million is speculation though.

I'm afraid that's the same argument that the Holocaust deniers make. Note I'm not saying ""you are as bad as them"", merely that the counter-argument is on shaky ground to begin with. Once you get beyond a million dead it's hard to keep count. 

&gt; doesn't mean people weren't immigrating away from such British organisations

No, in fact I made it very clear that I was not saying that. Is there any point in continuing this conversation if that's how you are going to play it?

&gt; didn't half of them die to diseases that we carried and they weren't immune to?

About 90% died from a plague before we even met them, it raced ahead following the European explorers first landings. This still left a sizeable population at the point the settling began and those that remained who opposed the settlers were treated with extreme violence with many villages being completely wiped out. At the time this was no moral quandary, executing the entire population following the sacking of a town was somewhat routine in certain situations e.g.  when they were a different religion or from an ethnic group known to be hostile.

IIRC there wa a town in France where the Nazi's did the same thing, everyone was killed and it remains unoccupied as a war monument today. Basically they were too late to the party for that kind of behaviour, one hundred years earlier no one would have cared. 

&gt; genuinely amazed I'm debating with people on the internet who believe nazism was only as bad as British colonisation

No one is saying the ideology is worse, that would be silly. But the effects have been worse, that is beyond debate. The Nazi's were a flash in the pan, amateur at best. Their genocide was a 3-legged sports day race in comparison to Britain's marathon.

Shelvey forced his way in with skills and goals so did sahin, cup games should be their way in, he was confident and relaxed, it seems more and more like he is losing it by being brought in when everyone has been playing for an hour.

Wisdom and Shelvey will gain consistency with age and games, Suso will learn to demand the ball as the season goes too, I'm not worried about them, it's the players who are too big to be benched I'm worried about.

true,NotMud,null,null,"It is fairly daft, as the ""shooting magazines"" available in the UK tend to be quite thoughtful publications concerning antique Purdeys and the more arcane elements of target rifle shooting. Certainly nothing that encourages irresponsibility.

The comparison between the perceptions of cars and firearms is a little threadbare, but the kind of material found in the average boy racer's mag is of far greater danger to the reader than that found in the back pages of Shooting Times.

WH Smiths and some commentators seem confused about the difference between a shotgun certificate and a firearms licence - perhaps they'll realise that their understanding is incorrect and reverse their regulations? Maybe they're reacting to a specific incident in which a child bought Country Life, saw an advert for .22 pellets and suddenly went on a high-profile but impeccably polite pigeon-killing rampage. Or perhaps, as the Telegraph seem to be implying, there has been pressure from animal rights groups who say that the content of some shooting magazines promotes cruelty.

I don't think it matters much though, in the big scheme of things. There are probably about a thousand kids who buy a shooting magazine, and maybe three-quarters of them get it delivered. Of the remainder, you're looking at a few dozen who would have gone to Smiths for it. It'll arguably restrict access to shooting, making it an even more elitist pursuit, and it might have a minutely detrimental effect on our performance at Rio in a few years' time. But in reality, people who want to buy shooting magazines will just buy them from the supermarket or get subscriptions.

true,Dossena,null,null,"Typical Liverpool. Totally dominate Newcastle in the first goal, make a mistake and find ourselves 1-0 down. 

Suarez was outstanding again for his goal. Jones put in a solid performance that was let down by the defence. Sterling continues to improve and had to put up with being pushed around quite a bit, needs to work on his tackling. Suso was impressive and I wish we kept him on longer. 

Wisdom is trying but he's still not quite at first team level. Caught out a few times and his mistake (the foul throw-in) led to the Newcastle goal.

Enrique is just confusing. He'll put in a great pass one moment, and then completely fuck up the next. Could have cost us the game at times today. 

Gerrard looked lively to start with but should have been subbed off instead of Suso. 

Jonjo had a shocker of a game. He was lazy and missed two very good goal scoring opportunities - one of which was practically an empty net. 

Allen was pretty woeful today too. 


Why can't we take corners? I don't think I can think of another team that wastes so many corners. It's a miracle if we ever get a decent ball in from one - most of the time today we failed to beat the first man. 

We really need another goal-scoring striker. We're lacking that threat and when it comes to having Downing come on when we're looking for a winning goal it shows how we are lacking in that department. Second in the shopping list needs to be a new leftback. I do like Enrique, he's just far too inconsistent.

If you make tea, the correct order is -Leaves/bag+sweetening - Hot water - stir and squidge until suffiiently dark brown and yummy - milk if required, this is how you make tea, do not try and change it.

If Suarez was gone, we wouldn't necessarily lose every match. Yes, it would be a lot harder, but you can't just take away his goals and compare it like that. It changes the whole complexion of the match. If we have no Suarez, we're more likely going to be more defensive, just hold the ball until there's a gap, rather than letting Suarez find it himself.

true,lsusobeast,lfcflame,,"I definitely think so. I think the purchase of Borini was Rodgers' attempt at getting a Walcott-esque player in the summer. Both Borini and Theo have very similar characteristics: ""clinical"" finishers, intelligent movement, poor with the ball at their feet, poor at creating space for themselves. They both possess their own positives as well. Borini lacks Walcott's pure pace, but has the work rate that Theo doesn't. 

A front 3 of Sterling, Walcott and Suarez would almost be the ideal forward players in Rodgers' system. All 3 are capable of playing any of the front 3 positions, and would open up endless opportunities for fluid, rotating play. We saw a little bit of this when Borini played with Suarez. The obvious flaw was that Borini is not up to the speed of the PL yet, and lost the ball often in wide spaces. 

Rodgers' system also relies heavily on wide play to create space in the middle of the pitch, something Walcott, Sterling and Suarez can all offer. This is something Suso (as much as I love him as a future player) does not offer us. The lad needs to be moved centrally ASAP.

The only real downside I see to Theo is 1) his work rate and 2) his build-up. In Arsenal's system, Theo's role has been little more than receiving the ball and pushing to the end-line to supply service for RVP. He does very little in regards to build-up, which is something Rodgers really demands of his forwards. Also, as I said, his passing is average and that could be a bit detrimental as well. Lastly, his work-rate has always been in question. He hates to play defense which is something Rodgers does not accept. Pressing is the foundation of our system, and Walcott would have to adapt to that. 

In conclusion, I think Walcott would be awesome. Getting him in January would be very beneficial since I think it will take a little time to get him used to the system. He's still a young player though, and Rodgers is tremendous with development. ",0,1352071922,null,0,false,0,c6wfqyl,t3_12mfbe,t1_c6wfqyl,t1_c6wff05,null,1430320458,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Today I saw 11 players who seemed to be making up the tactics as they went along. It looked like we have never practiced a set piece and every corner from Redding seemed to put QPR on a knife edge.
Our players looked sluggish and lacked formation and organisation. Most of all we lack self-confidence, today's game will have done nothing to improve that.

I have not been calling for Hughes to go, I know we need stability. The issue now is that what we have is Hughes' creation; the club was effectively given to him, he's had everything he's wanted, there are no excuses.

If something is not sorted out quickly we will start losing good players in the Jan transfer window, because they'll make it plain they want to leave the club. The likes of Cezar and Granero don't need to be in a relegation scrap.

Club supporters are extremely defensive in terms of people supporting a club just because they won a title (they're dubbed glory hunting supporters). Im not saying you're one as a matter of fact its never to late to support this great English club of ours however other supporters will give you more respect if you put the time and effort to find out for yourself about players, this history and even some small chants and etc and then discuss it with us. 

Hope you have found this a little bit helpful. Now in answer to your question the African up front is an Italian named Balotelli and yes he's technically African as he's Ghanaian born but was adopted out when he was small. He's very prone to immature stunts that grabs the tabloid headlines almost 1-2 times every 2-3 months.

So I bought a custom skin from www.skinit.com that I designed (took me about 20 minutes) from pictures I got from google. If anyone wants the pictures I used I can look for them, but essentially I just used google. 

Just a note here: you do not have to order the skin from skinit, if there is a closer alternative I would take it as skinit is located in the US, and it took about a month for me to receive my skin (I'm in Toronto, Canada). There's nothing wrong with the Skin (I like it) it just took a while to ship, so just have a little patience if you're using them and you're not in the US. It cost me 20 bucks plus shipping. 

The back is just one picture of the back of a Torres jersey (I made sure to get a picture with his autograph in it, just looked cooler for me lol). 

The front on the other hand took a bit lol. I copy and pasted the Chelsea logo picture (looks like this one http://i.imgur.com/N39XB.jpg) over and over to create a consistent blue trim without showing the logo part until the end (top right in the original picture). The Adidas logo and the number 9 had transparent backgrounds, so they blended in perfectly with the blue trim. 

I then ordered a blue bumper off eBay to finish it off and get complete protection (I got mine for 4 bucks here http://r.ebay.com/nZJeP0, but I'm sure any blue bumper will do). It blended in perfectly!

You don't need the bumper, I just though it looked nicer with it, but it still looks nice without a bumper. 

The picture I posted do not do it enough justice, I've gotten a lot of compliments from people, many who don't even like Chelsea lol. And my phone is completely covered pretty much.

The scale is based on an outsider's perception. Lawful Evil can have a cause that they feel is just, but if they're going around killing people and turning people into emotionless robots, that's pretty evil. 

Also, I would accept Rory as Lawful Good. He is definitely good, and he is always the one to counter The Doctor and Amy's ""chaotic-ness."" It's possible for a Lawful Good person to do something unlawful if he is doing so unwillingly at the behest of his party.

Jack being Lawful Neutral is a stretch, but that's a tricky alignment to peg in the first place. Lawful Neutral means that the person follows *his own* form of morality and ethics. That doesn't mean following the law of the land. It means that he has a ""code."" A thief could be Lawful Neutral, presuming he follows a ""code,"" such as stealing only from people he deems bad guys or not stealing from other thieves.

&gt;Person A puts a poster on the front of his market stall saying ""I sell apples. Please buy some!"". Person A spent quite a lot of time on this poster, he even made the frame for it himself, costing quite a bit of time , effort and money to create.

&gt;Person B comes along, and by some delicious twist of fate, he's allergic to apples terribly, and finds Person A's poster to be conflicting to his interests, and in his moment of unbridled rage, writes on the poster with a big red Sharpie saying 'Person A is a fucking cunt, who the fuck does he think he is trying to tell me to buy his fucking apples?'. 

It doesn't matter what the message is in this scenario, the fact that the creator of the advert (Be it the M.O.D., or old Mrs. Moggins from the greengrocers.) went through the process of purchasing the rights for the advert, spent money designing the advert and then bought the real estate and licensing fees to put the advert up, means that it is vandalism, as defined in English common law.

No need for all this bollocks about Orwellian states of mind and submission to the government, someone took the time to create that, and shitting all over it by writing on it or snapping a piece of is both vandalism and destruction of property.

How about this, I don't agree with the British National Party, does that give me the right to go around to a member of the BNP's house and scrawl 'You fucking racist pig, I hope you fucking choke on your own inflated sense of self-worth, you infuriatingly egotistical bastard.' all over his front door? Nevermind that it wouldn't fit, but the fact that it belongs to somebody else and that I'm an adult who can argue and rationalise that 'Hmm, maybe this isn't very nice, I wouldn't want this to happen to me, how about I don't fucking ruin this thing that doesn't belong to me.' should clue you in to where you went wrong.

Lets be clear here. I never mentioned anything about defacing your 'for sale' sign here, or breaking your windows. I would treat any individuals property with respect. But posters and billboards are not in the same category. A billboard for the army, a car, a shop, whatever, is part of a public environment which we all share and have ownership over. That might not be true in the law, but it is true in the reality. So I have no problem with posters being defaced with witty or political comments. They are part of the environment, they are there to push an individuals or companies message, and defacing them is a legitimate response, an interaction, intervention or subversion of the intended message. It is not legal, but it is a basic right. It doesn't matter that the company paid for the billboard.

Of course public idolisation of the military doesn't seem to have reached the levels of the US, but I worry for my country because unlike the US the authorities are able (and apparently very willing) to prosecute people for badmouthing the military - heinous crimes like burning poppies and saying soldiers are going to hell and the like.",0,1352079559,null,0,false,0,c6whso6,t3_12m1n5,t1_c6whso6,t1_c6wah5i,null,1430321416,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,JancariusSeiryujinn,smith,Smith,"I disagree that there is an objective morality, especially when it comes to fiction.  And you're confusing 'an outsider' with 'human'.  Especially in the Doctor Who universe, where there are multitudes of species with a variety of cultures, and, as mentioned, the Cybermen think they are helping people with their upgrades.  And it doesn't technically kill them (for certain definitions of kill), it merely places their bodies and minds in a heavily armed and armored metal body, and then blocks their emotions.  The Borg, the Cybermen, etc cannot in fact be evil, because they lack malice, and they believe they are helping other races to advance socially and technologically.  Further, one would argue the Cybermen/Borg cannot be evil because they seem largely lacking in free will.  A mindless golem cannot be evil, it can only follow directions given to it.

No one disagreed that Rory was good.  He is simply not particularly Lawful.  He and Amy fit fine in Neutral Good, he exhibits no particular devotion to a moral code that would mark him as Lawful.

You are completely wrong about the nature of the L/C scale in that last sentence, but yes, it has everything to do with a code.  It has nothing to do with predictability, except in the sense of that code.  A person who follows a rigidly defined personal code (preeminent examples being knights, samurai, monks) is Lawful.  A person who is wild, unpredictable, and generally antiauthoritarian is classified as chaotic.  Someone who falls in between is Neutral.  Generally, on both the L/C, and G/E axis, if a person is not clearly to one side, they should be classified as Neutral.  This is the reason given that the vast majority of the human population is in fact, True Neutral, because real people rarely consistently behave in a manner consistent with one alignment.

Jack is not Lawful because Jack does not appear at any point to have a personal code.  When we first meet him, he is a out for himself con man who nearly accidently ends the human race, and as of Torchwood season one (I have not yet started Season 2)/Doctor Who S3 Finale, his motivations have never been influenced by a code (Ie at no point does he refer to something he can't do which would benefit him if he just did it despite the rules).

The problem with the mail is they're really good at writing plausible stories and they do actually have some really interesting articles - they know what people want to hear and what'll convince them, they even manage to do some actual reporting (i.e. going somewhere and finding something out rather than copy pasting from a ticker tape) - people like david ike are easy to ignore or the edl, their obvious about their nonsense, the mail is insidious.  Someone without access to other facts is gong to believe what they read, why shouldn't they - it's plausible that an animal could break into someone's house and attack them, it happens in other countries - why not here? who knows what happens when urban foxes live in cities, when i was a kid this were all fields!

If you were about to marry someone and they cheated on you the night before your wedding, who would realistically forgive them in a few weeks, two/three months at most. And that's completely ignoring the fact that Gwen did commit treason. I wish they never killed off Lancelot, Arthur and Gwen got married, and there was UST between Gwen and Lancelot before they finally betrayed Arthur. That would have been so much better.

I think a lot of Morgana plots are just poor writing at this point. She could have killed Arthur and Gwen without Merlin even realizing it and she has no reason to suspect there is even anyone there who can stop her. The show is going nowhere without a magic reveal because there's really nowhere else to go.

true,GyantSpyder,null,null,"The Doctor has historically respected and obeyed a bunch of rules about how time travel must work -- the most notable being the idea of ""fixed points"" in time that always must happen.

In *The Waters of Mars* he has an epiphany, and realizes that while he's been following these rules for hundreds of years, they are not in fact natural laws -- they were rules set down and upheld by the Time Lords, who, as custodians of time, for all their faults, used to enforce them in a variety of direct and indirect ways.

But now the Time Lords are gone, and he's the last one left. This means these rules exist because he follows them by habit (or, you know, for good reasons related to why they were set down in the first place).

Also, he has done a whole bunch of really impressive things lately and defeated a whole bunch of Big Bads, and he is trying to deal with the pride that comes from doing that, even though oftentimes casting what happened as a ""victory"" feels wrong to him, and because he still has trauma and survivor guilt to work through from the Time War.

Triggered a bit by the pain he feels over the seemingly inevitable events of *The Waters of Mars*, the 10th Doctor forms a new rationalization for why he can disregard these laws -- he is the ""Timelord Victorious"" -- as the last of the Time Lords, the destroyer of the Time Lords (and other time travelers too, like the Daleks, sort of, a bunch of times), he is ""victorious"" and, as such, he has ""won"" the right to act however he wants -- setting and following rules as he sees fit. 

There's a sense he finds the idea troubling himself, but he's kind of an emotional basket case at the time, because he knows his death/regeneration is coming up pretty soon, and he doesn't have a companion and is kind of distraught. But he has a big speech where he rages a bunch and basically proclaims himself the Nietzschean Ubermensch of Time Travelers.

The person he's talking to reacts to this *really negatively*, says it is morally wrong and a bad thing, and then takes a rather drastic action in relation to it that kind of chin-checks The Doctor and knocks him off his pedestal.

This theme, though, that the Doctor has become too enamored of victory and self-aggrandizement, comes back in ""When A Good Man Goes to War"" and the aftermath, where the 11th Doctor confronts that it is kind of problematic to be this titanic force that destroys empires at will and terrorizes his enemies across the millennia.

I know pretty much exactly what they'll say.  That they do have a policy of calling it the Persian Gulf but they were in Abu Dhabi at the time, broadcasting from the UAE, and 'when in Rome' and all that.  Out of respect for their hosts they referred to it as they prefer it to be referred to.  It sounds an awful lot like the commentator was asked to put the record straight by his line producer who simply didn't want to create waves whilst in UAE.

But yeah, write your letter if you want.  I don't see why they'll dismiss a legitimate complaint just because of where it comes from.  It's there to ensure quality control.

Write to 'Points of View' if you're really mad and at the shaking of fists stage.  That'll teach 'em and  Jeremy Vine might even read it out on telly for you.

I personally like the description of Lawful being a personality that conforms to other peoples' rules and expectations while Chaotic does what is right in their own eyes.

So, Amy Pond is completely Chaotic because she only obeys her internal moral compass and really doesn't listen to anyone.

The Doctor is hard to place because over the course of his many lives he has gained a lot of depth. But I would place 10 as Neutral Good. He has no problem overriding stupid laws when he feels like it but doesn't just make up his own system whenever he wants to. I would have chosen the quote, ""I'm sorry; I am so sorry.""

Rory works as Lawful Good. His primary motivation is Amy and always seems perturbed when he has to bend the rules. Being the [spoiler](#s ""Centurian"") helps fit that theme well.

I never got around to watching Torchwood so I don't know Jack's character very well.

River Pond... is hard to place. Chaotic fits and I would claim she drifts from Good to Neutral depending on the particular episode.

Cybermen would probably fit Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil depending on how you interpret their intent. One of the interesting comparisons from D&amp;D is that natural forces tend to be considered Neutral -- they don't really care about you. They just go about their destruction impartially.

Daleks would be Lawful Evil in the sense that they actively seek out the destruction of everything not them. They differ from the Cybermen only in motivation -- their actual goals are roughly the same. The key point is that the Cybermen think they are saving non-Cybermen while Daleks just hate everything other than themselves. The debate between Lawful and Neutral is a toss-up; I find their unbreaking obedience to their principles tips them into Lawful.

The Master is Neutral Evil. He tends to stand alone without peer so it is hard to judge his Lawful or Chaotic tendancies. Just taking over things creatively or self-destructively is not enough for me to see him as truely Chaotic.

The Tardis fits as Unaligned but it is hard to make the case for it not being Good. Definately not Lawful; its stint with a real personality placed it closer to Chaotic. But I'd keep it at Unaligned.

So, my (completely opinion based) grid:

* Lawful Good - Rory
* Neutral Good - 10
* Chaotic Good - Amy
* Lawful Neutral - Cybermen
* Chaotic Neutral - River
* Lawful Evil - Daleks
* Neutral Evil - The Master

This leaves a gap for True Neutral and Chaotic Evil. I would argue that the Dream Lord makes a good candidate for Chaotic Evil. The motivation was purely attempting to break the choices and laws of others. But I feel this is a bit of a stretch and don't have a good alternative handy.

True Neutral could perhaps be the Ood. The exist mostly impartially (aside from not wanting to be enslaved) but help out from time to time. The Doctor has probably helped bring them into the Neutral Good side of things near the end of their arc.

Anyway, I love these kinds of comparisons. :)",0,1352094227,null,0,false,0,c6wloh8,t3_12me1f,t1_c6wloh8,t3_12me1f,null,1430323249,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I'm at university, and know Americans who have came over to study here for a semester. They've tried to be ambitious about seeing many countries throughout Europe, and everyone agrees that the things they want to do have been a bit ambitious. If you want to do some travelling and you're not alone, you'll be find to go to Paris or Belgium or wherever, but not throughout the continent, all the way to Italy, Greece, Spain, Austria, and everywhere else. Also, if travelling's your thing, join the International Society that there's likely to be. At least at my university, they do a lot of travelling throughout the UK. Liverpool, York, Oxford, Lake District, Peak District, London, places in Wales and Scotland (at least mine does that).

Also, befriend an Englishman! Whilst we may joke about disliking Americans, as long as you're not loud, obnoxious, and boast at how you believe that America is the best, then you'll easily be able to make friends with others who aren't foreigners to the country. I made friends with these Americans (they came as a group), told them some differences in the language that they didn't know (first day they were here), showed them some money, walked around the area with them (they seemed to have some problems crossing the road without dying) and generally just got to know them and help them settle in.

Also, assuming that you're under the legal age to drink alcohol in America, you'll definitely be able to do that over here (to buy alcohol is 18). Don't do what this American did, go crazy and down a bottle of whisky in an evening... really, just be sensible whilst you're over here in that aspect. Of course drink, but don't take it too far for a) your sake and b) the sake of others'.

That's all I can think of now, and I need to get ready to take the train back to Manchester. Any questions on them and how they've settled in, along with any others, just feel free to ask.

Good and Evil are hard to frame objectively. The best judge of whether something or someone falls into either category is how selfishly they fulfill their own desires at the expense of others.  
  
For example, the Daleks are, in my opinion, lawful evil. They adhere to a rigid code and set way of thinking. They have a chain of command that they will almost always follow unless it conflicts with the Dalek code. The reason they are evil is that the want to exterminate all other races for the benefit of only Daleks. No altruism guides their genocides.  
  
On the other hand, The Doctor is Chaotic Good because he wishes only good on others. He is willing to sacrifice himself (or his morals or accumulate regrets) to save the lives of others and, on numerous occasions, has done so.

I wish people wouldn't use the word to conjure up pathetic notions of heroism and honour, as if these are rewards that actually exist. I won't stand by the side of a road crying for them because that might encourage other's to follow after them thinking that all those tears mean a worthy death.

You're protecting the right for a government to propagandise because of private property? 

Surely putting private property above a human being is about the most totalitarian, authoritarian argument that you can put forward. I mean, I respect a person's right to personal possessions and the right to make a living; but using that as an argument, as some kind of sacrament, above all else, is truly Orwellian.

In a USSR they would say ""the state owns that"" and the state was god, no-one questioned god. Here you are saying ""That is a persons property"" and holding it to the same standard as the Soviet's would an item of state.

The scary thing about 1984 is that the system (whatever system that is, communism, capitalism, whatever) does not accept any ideas but its own. By using the notion of private property to justify one's right to propagandise you are holding this opinion in some sacred place above those that have no property.

If you're talking more generally, I'd make a couple of points. Firstly, certainly historically speaking, in order to have the luxury to write and to publish, it was necessary to be pretty well-birthed in the first place.  Most historians, writers, economists, scientists, essayists, philosophers, etc. prior to, say, the end of the second world war had to come from money to be able to afford to live that lifestyle.  Especially since, the further you go back, the more they would have had to be dependent on a sympathetic patron if they didn't have independent wealth and would be likely to experience punitive sanctions for publishing anything far off of a well-trodden road.  Marx, for example, came from reasonable money, but was forced to live a life of borderline destitution because he was hounded by the authorities on the continent and ended up fleeing to the UK and scraping a living through publishing in the US etc. (plus he was lucky enough to have a rich friend, Engels, who provided him with some patronage).

Secondly, those radical working class thinkers there were, who found time to systematise their ideas, were likely to have smaller voices, be more marginalised, and be less likely to get their thoughts into (lasting) print (there were numerous gifted speakers, but their firebrand rhetoric was rarely reduced to the written word, and where it was, generally only to pamphlets, which are less likely to have survived).",0,1352112382,null,0,1352112652,0,c6wo0cp,t3_12m8za,t1_c6wo0cp,t1_c6wnwrw,null,1430324470,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The fact that a civil identity has some precedence before ethnic, political, cultural, religious or linguistic identities is just a basic tenet of a modern, functional, secular state, and an independent Wales would face exactly the same issues as the current United Kingdom. So the matter of independence is really separate from this abstract debate about consensus seeking in political decision making. The only way around this contradiction is to say that Welshness is, or should be the One True Identity which can subsume all others, therefore the same problems won't apply in the new nation.

I can vividly remember how exciting it was getting ready to go to Liverpool the first time on holiday, but also how anxiety-inducing it was trying to work out where to get the best experience.


It's a merseyside derby, the atmosphere will be great, but keep in mind that quietest fans are all the premium ticket ones, because its generally travellers and wealthier people who are happy to fork out more for tickets, but don't go to matches often and don't sing up. So in truth, you're probably not really gonna get a ""drink with regular fans"" etc. If you want the best atmosphere, buy a resale ticket in the kop.

If you want the best view, then stay away from the Anfield Road and Kop because you're view will invariably be limited when the balls up the other side of the pitch.

I'm fairly sure the LFC website describes what each of the packages include - some are just a program and a room you can sit in before the game, others have sit down meals before/after with a former player there to talk about something or other - so you can read and pick your own, although I'd say avoid any package that advertises pre-game entertainment, because you want to be in your seat to get the most from the experience. 60-90 minutes before the game, wander around the stadium, soak up the merseyderby atmosphere and then take a seat and watch the pre-game warm-ups, chants etc. 

As for the seat itself, I've sat in the centenary club, and it's got a really good view, but keep in mind that it's upper stand so you're not that close to the action (although it's still much much better than any Australian stadiums). The atmosphere can also be fairly flat in the centenary seats. I remember seeing a home game against stoke a few years ago and it was dead. The bells and whistles for centenary stand are just a free programme and access to the bar, and a padded seat i think. I think Lower centenary stand is potentially a better bet, although I don't know where the seat is. Main stand could also be fantastic, partiuclarly if you're just behind the dugout, but I'm really not sure where the premium tickets in that stand are.

1. The skirt seems to be made of a thicker material than fiberglass. Hemispheres looked right, and were pushed through from the inside.

2. The Gunboxes were obviously made of wood, and multiple screws were visible. The slats looked to be made of wood. The gun could have been an original, since the rods looked brazed, but the diameter seemed too small. It doesn't even have the ability to move them on the balls!

3. The head was completely wrong. The Ears were way too far back, the lens was secured on the outside of the eye, and the eyeball itself was almost spherical. The dome was a hemisphere, and lacked the bevel around the bottom.

In fact, for people like me, who know these props backwards, it's really nothing like an original, and the shop could be in trouble for trying to pass it off as one. Because quite frankly it isn't, I guess it's a fan made replica, not a bad effort, but no where NEAR close enough to fool any 'expert'.

Comparing the two is ridiculous. One is operating as a peacekeeper with minimal weapons in a UK city. One is armed to the teeth in a wartorn country shooting at brown people who have the capacity to shoot back and enjoy planting bombs under your car.

Given the choice, I know which job sounds less risky.

If the government wants to raise taxes to pay for soldiers who have been injured, then do it.

true,Lyise,null,null,"&gt;You're protecting the right for a government to propagandise because of private property? 

Yes, much like you have the right (in my opinion) to pay for advertising throughout the country which would be anti-government.

&gt;Surely putting private property above a human being is about the most totalitarian, authoritarian argument that you can put forward. I mean, I respect a person's right to personal possessions and the right to make a living; but using that as an argument, as some kind of sacrament, above all else, is truly Orwellian.

A poster isn't preventing anyone's freedoms at all; it's just a poster.

&gt;In a USSR they would say ""the state owns that"" and the state was god, no-one questioned god. Here you are saying ""That is a persons property"" and holding it to the same standard as the Soviet's would an item of state.

&gt;The scary thing about 1984 is that the system (whatever system that is, communism, capitalism, whatever) does not accept any ideas but its own. By using the notion of private property to justify one's right to propagandise you are holding this opinion in some sacred place above those that have no property. 

We aren't in the USSR; if there is a message put out in any form of advertising, be it by the government (as in this case) or by anyone else, there are lines by which you complain about the message and have it removed.  In 1984, there was no line by which to have this kind of effect.

Government is also not the only body that can advertise, as I stated above, in my opinion you should be able to pay for counter-advertising without any issues at all.

&gt;The Graffiti in question does not silence the propaganda (nothing was even crossed out), it challenges it in one of the simplest ways possible; through humour. The authoritarian act is using the sacred law of property ownership to silence criticism

Yes, it was an amusing message.  I'm anti-war, I agree with the sentiment, however, the company that put that poster up (which is not the government) is now going to have to pay to replace it, and that is hardly fair. 

If you disagree with something, you don't have to attack it, you can send complaints about it, you can broadcast counter messages and so on.  This is not what the vandal did, however, they chose a tactic which will not affect the government line but will cost a private business money.

The base of this one is original 60's and is easily spotted by the fact that it's 'narrow' and easily spotted in the series. Partiuclarlly in 'The Chase'. The rest is also screen used but I'd guess it wasn't made unti much later, maybe mid-70's, http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgmcintyre/35688300/

If soldiers were allowed to choose if what causes they fought for nor not we wouldn't have an army, we'd have a very well armed mob.

Secondly, you can blame people for joining at a time of little job security and few job prospects. Although we always hear the bad side about those who are killed, wounded, or end up homeless on the streets, the vast majority come out with a high amount of skills and qualifications they'd never have gained elsewhere. Especially for pre-GCSE drop-outs the army provides the best chance of them getting these qualifications elsewhere as it has a vested interest in making sure they learn well and pass.

And finally, the argument that people shouldn't join if they don't agree with an ongoing war is also incredibly shortsighted. If recruitment and retention were linked to the acceptability of wars (when the army has no control over the acceptability of said wars themselves) then just like any large organisation the continuity of experience will be lost. The lessons learnt the hard way will be lost, and then one day we'll find ourselves in some far more ""legitimate"" conflict and we'll have to learn the hard way again. That will be tragic.

true,ProfSmiles,tennant,Tennant,"While I don't have any specific proof of this, I find that Eleven and Moffat don't go into things as much as RTD did with Nine and Ten. As I said, no specific proof as an example escapes my mind, but with Nine and Ten, especially Ten, there was this fun, goofy side (my mind is returning a bit I think (Nine dancing in *The Doctor Dances*, ""I give you, air from my lungs"" from *The End of the World* as well as Ten, well, just think of [his big smile]http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m939waykUZ1rrugdwo1_500.jpg)), but there was seriousness and depth as well. Eccleston is often criticised as a bad Doctor, but he was *amazing!* at providing a Doctor that had just come out of the Time War and so on (as others have previously said), and then Ten with his rules, the way he [treats The Family of Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfGWRccHLRY), how he deals with the Master and the return of the Timelords, and of course the ending of *Midnight* (""Dont.... Just, don't..."").


Then along comes Eleven and Moffat. I think the episodes have been perfectly written for Smith, and they match his character perfectly with all the fun and games and ""Come along, Pond(s)!"" And there's depth to these episodes, too. [""Good men don't need rules.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5JnqPSzSLo) from *A Good Man Goes to War* and [""You think hatred, is beautiful...""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e9fr1bL-yY#t=109s) from *Asylum of the Daleks*. But the problem I have with Moffat and Eleven is that they don't take things far enough. After the latter mentioned exchange, it's completely dropped as they discuss how to destroy the planet. Sure, the situation didn't exactly allow for too much further discussion, but that's not the only time it's happened. If my memory serves me correctly, the only time Eleven has descended into any sort of emotional state below boredom is when [spoiler](Amy and Rory 'die') at the end of *The Angels Take Manhattan*, but even then I think Ten gave a better performance in a similar situation ([""I don't want to go""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFQQVEd5LoM)).


I'm starting to lose my train of thought now, but the rough idea is that RTD's era had a lot more emotion and was deeper in so many ways and at so many times, as well as having all the fun that Moffat's era has, despite his having very little emotion/depth.

The flip side is that if the minimum wage is too high it makes it expensive to hire people. Companies already pay national insurance and will need things like employee liability insurance etc too, so their costs go beyond the simple £6-7/hr.

If it becomes too expensive to hire people, we will see even worse hiring freezes than we have right now - and it will disproportionately affect people at the bottom end of the wage scale too.

I had hoped you would realise that my last post was a joke. Are we really going to do this? Downvote-insult-argument, downvote-insult-argument? 

Because, ultimately - neither of us likes the Saudis, both of us hope for a replacement for oil, and both of us knows that, at the moment, *there is no* replacement for oil. None. We are hoping for one with Fusion, or improved Fission plants, combined with electric cars, but at the moment, we have squat, and the Saudis hold all the cards. Selling those evil fuckers arms is about the only way we have of clawing the money back until the game changes.

true,draxenato,null,null,"I'm a long time fan of the classic show but I hated the ""RTD"" (script editor/producer Russell Twunt Davies) years.

In fairness to RTD he did try and craft a pilot episode, Rose (the first Eccelston story) that reestabslished the mythos and threw out most of the existing continuity. I can't say I agreed with him but I could see his point. TV as a medium has progressed so much since the classic show was aorund that even the dialogue with the audience has changed almost beyond recognition. Most of todays viewers wouldn't appreciate the classic show on its own merits and would struggle to see why it was so popular.

Look at the Hartnell era and you're looking at stage plays performed in front of the (usually static) camera. It seems staid and boring when compared to just about any contemporary primetime drama/SF. The Pertwee era was 007-lite, with added soldiers and car chases. The early TomDoc years an excercise in gothic horror/suspense.

The show changes every few years and brings itself up to date, with the expectations of the current audience. Most of the times it gets it right, the obvious exception being the later years of John Nathan Turners producership ('83 to '89 were especially bad). In that case one mans ego brought the show, quite literally, to disaster. It was cancelled twice.

Not being a fan of RTD I can see why you'd have problems with the Eccleston / Tennant years. I would recommend the current Doctor, Matt Smith, whos tenure under producer Stephen Moffat has brought the show to new heights.

If you're interested in taking it a bit further I'd recommend the following watchlist, all from the newish series

S1-E06 ""Dalek"" - brings back the Daleks and for this episode at least, reestablishes them as the shows Big Bad. If you can get past the RTD penned cringeworthy final five minutes then it's not bad at all.

S1-E09 &amp; E10 ""The Empty Child"" - a two parter set in London, WW2. It's the first story written by future showrunner Stephen Moffat and it showcases the series pretty well. It feels like a classic storyline but with 2005 production values.

S2-E04 ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" - another Moffat written story, quite simply one of the best episodes I've ever seen, an exercise in how to do this sort of television right.

S3-E10 ""Blink"" - going back to the Moffat well again. A fresh take on the shows usual formula. Introduces the Weeping Angels the new series' most memorable and effective enemies

S4-E08 &amp; E09 - ""Silence in the Library"" - Another Moffat two parter, this one introduces the character of River Song and her complicated timeline, this is essential to getting the most out of the Matt Smith years.

S4-E11 - ""Turn Left"" I hated RTDs time on the show and I hated Catherine Tate as the Doctors assistant, so I was surprised this episode was pretty good. It shows what would've happened if the Doctor and (his then current) companion hadn't met. The effects on both their lives and on the rest of us. It helps if you've been following the rest of this otherwise fairly dire season, if you haven't then it probably wouldn't mean much to you, but this was an unexpected diamond in the rough.

After that you'd be better equipped than most viewers to appreciate the Matt Smith Doctor, season 5 onwards.  At the end of the day Doctor Who isn't for everyone, but it's been around since 1963 and gone through so many incarnations that I think most SF fans would be hard pushed to find some part of the shows history they didn't enjoy.

2010-11: Christian Purslow was playing Fantasy Manager, and was the man responsible for bringing Joe Cole to the club. It was a move that had some political motivations - bringing someone like Cole in would shut up the fans by showing them we could still attract ""big"" players and pay the wages that come with such players. *Sigh*

2011-12: Damien Comolli's role as Director of Football included being responsible for all transfer negotiations. Even if the players signed were all approved (and in some cases identified) by Kenny, all the financial elements of the deal were Comolli's remit. We all know how that went.

During both those periods, Ian Ayre was our commercial director, and was not involved with transfers. This last window has been the first since Ian Ayre was made Managing Director, and the first where he's been involved with transfers.

Those from a wealthier background will on average have a higher standard of education and opportunities, and this will be reflected in their abilities.

Having a ruler that was born not made had several benefits:

* The legitimate ruler is from a fairly small pool, and there aren't too many fights.  Sure, there was the war of the roses, but England is not like the Byzantine Empire.

*  When monarchs were good at ruling, they ruled, when they didn't want to, they had better men help them.  Take Henry VIII with Wolsey and Cromwell.  They were not from wealthy backgrounds, but the monarch allowed them to effectively run the government day to day.

* Monarchs received some of the best educations in the land and learned from a young age what they needed to be able to do.  Henry VIII (again) could speak many different languages, was academically able, and had learned what he was good at and what he was not good at.

If this is true then I am seriously torn apart here. I can't imagine how incredible Pep might be managing talents like Hazard, Oscar and Mata. Although I'm not certain Torres'll even be here at that time (sorry to those who this angers but I just honestly can't see him staying if he doesn't pick up his form) I think he plays a system Torres can really fit into (similar to Del Bosque's with Spain last summer). That is of course, if he were to join at the end of the season like most journalists are implying.

However RDM has been doing a fantastic job and a few bad results does not justify talks about him getting the sack and I have no idea whether Pep would be any better at managing Chelsea than RDM is now (note that I hugely admire RDM and have no longing to see him leave).

Thirdly of course is the matter of Mou who seems all but destined to return to BPL in a year or two and if we would have recently hired Pep by then, then that would mean Mou ending up at a club like Manchester United or Arsenal or something of the sort and that would tear me up.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Homelessness seriously deserves more attention - especially with the housing benefit 'reforms' likely to create a lot more homeless young people.

This is simply not true. No Government wants to create MORE homeless people. 
The benefit cap, for example will stop people from receiving more than £500/week, which is more than enough to rent a house anywhere except the most expensive parts of London.  Read more about it [here](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap), or google it. 

&gt;Also I could be naive having never been in such a situation but doesn't the Local Authority have a requirement to provide shelter for them? Even if it's in B&amp;B's etc.

Yes. Technically, there is no reason for anyone to be homeless in the UK. People do end up in B&amp;B's and hostels. However, if you make yourself [intentionally homeless](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/homelessness/help_from_the_council/intentional_homelessness) the local Council no longer has a duty to house you. This is the fault of a Council and not the National Government. Mostly, it's caused by people not knowing the law or how these things work. So yes, you can be in a situation where you are on the streets with no recourse from Government.

Des Kelly and Neil Ashton are huddled together, stroking themselves to climax over re runs of Arsenal and Liverpool matches, while muttering thickly about the beautiful game, talented youngsters and the boot room mentality.

&lt;he looms over Des and Neil menacingly, who cower away and hide their pathetic erections&gt;

**Des** But boss, I wrote a whole article about Chelsea yesterday, all about how vile and unspeakable they are, and how Chelsea should immediately forfeit all points and trophies earned since the dawn of time.....

**Neil** And I did a whole set of pieces pulling apart anything Chelsea had said and insinuating it was all sour grapes, while also speaking highly of Lord Ferg (blessed be his name) and how repulsive it was to besmirch the good name of a referee who was found absolutely not guilty of threatening a person who he owed money too, while being in significant debt....

**Sports Ed** I don't care about that! I want something in the paper every day in the days before a match. Unrest in the camp, owner unhappy, manager under pressure - you know the drill! Now crank up the headline-o-matic and give me a story!

The law is made by 'the national government' not the local council, also there is plenty of case-law, where the local authority will ""gate keep"" or find a decision of not priority incorrectly.

Tbh the local councils have an unenviable position of trying to allocate resources far smaller than the number of homeless in the area.

&gt; there is no reason for anyone to be homeless in the UK.
IMO the majority of people who are longterm homeless have a substance and/or mental health problem which means they are unlikely to secure a tenancy due to the inability to manage or keep it.

Huntelaar is a short-term solution while Walcott is a long-term solution. The transfer fee for these players doesn't seem to be the issue but the wages are. But ... why?

Huntelaar will likely only be on the books for a couple seasons or so, while Walcott will surely be worth his weekly wages in the years to come.

Andy Carroll's wages will be off the books. Surely Joe Cole will be moved in January (even if it's just loaning him and having the other club pay part of his wages). Downing and his wages have to go, right? And with our numerous young defenders, perhaps Enrique and his wages can be sacrificed to help pay for Huntelaar and Walcott.

Of course, it's much, much easier said than done and I know that just throwing a Walcott and a Huntelaar together with Suarez won't necessarily mean instantaneous goals in the real world (due to chemistry, adjusting to new club, new philosophy, new league in Huntelaar's case, etc.) ... but I guess the ultimate ""TL;DR"" point is that I think we need *two* experienced strikers and we can find ways to make the room for their wages.",0,1352133142,null,0,false,0,c6wrddq,t3_12knmu,t1_c6wrddq,t1_c6vydz4,null,1430326101,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

We will always need courts and laws unless you propose mob rule, which is fine until you're the one being lynched. (And you'll go a long way to find a better system than one based on a thousand years of precedence).  


Yes, we will always need courts, because it turns out the outer ends of the spectrum of human behaviors are detrimental to rest. And  the more 'equal' you make a society, the narrower the 'normal' range of behaviors becomes... so in your perfect state... bigger prisons.

There's really only two things they can do to increase the amount of profit: increase premiums or cut costs.

The problem with this is it's a very competitive industry. Most have already cut costs to the bone and if one insurer increases premiums, any increase in profit will be offset by lost customers. Unless, of course, you can force the entire industry to raise premiums at the same time. 

How do you do this? Simple. Start encouraging the cost of claims to go up. Push legal expenses cover then every time someone claims, pass their details on to a set of ambulance chasers. Only work with selected body shops (who charge anything from 3-5 times what it should cost to straighten out a dent and replace a bumper).

This way you can tell the customer you're doing them a favour: you're helping them claim compensation for (insert spurious reason here) which comes from the other person involved in the accident. You're taking their car directly to the nearest approved bodyshop and arranging a courtesy car.

What you don't tell them is you're doing the same for every one of the X thousand claims your team handle this year, meaning the industry as a whole will be forced to increase rates next year.

Then read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER). Miniature suns in a bottle, coming to a planet near you, 2020. This is, of course, setting aside the fact that we've had controlled fusion for years. What we do not have is fusion where the energy generated consistently exceeds the energy put in, but we've been getting closer to that, year on year. And ITER will finally do it for real.

People that use language like ""techno narcissism"" and ""magical thinking"" when talking about engineering problems are usually scientifically illiterate Green party members. For instance, if you start talking about the problems with wind turbines, such as the fact
that we are running out of [molybdenum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum), or the fact that they are unreliable, don't really produce much power, and work only on specific sites, they frequently dismiss these as ""engineering problems"" which will soon be resolved. 
However, mention *any* form of new nuclear power generation, and they are quick to suggest that, somehow, *that specific* set of associated engineering problems are insurmountable. Simply because the word ""nuclear"" was used. Next time I have a chat with a Green I'm going to use the phrase

true,Taszee,tennant,Tennant,"From my point of view I still like Tennant better, but I put this on to the writing for Matt Smith. I very much like the writing but I find that Matt Smith has been written into a childish version of the Doctor. I am kind of sad at his part because when Matt is being a true Doctor, not screwing around and trying to solve problems I find his acting to be incredible. But yet he comes off as being petty sometimes. I do blame this on the insecurity experienced by the Tenth from the Waters of Mars.      
     
I found that Tennant was better at being the mixture of Old and New that encompasses the Doctor. He easily passed from being happy and joking to being extremely dark and genuinely scary. When Smith is showing his temper it seems more like a temper tantrum then the ancient anger that Tennant showed.  
    
    
When talking about the writing, I mention I found Matt to be more childish but I also find the writing to have a new depth. The episodes build on each other greatly. They have some odd paradoxes but otherwise I love them. They tell a story from start to finish with some subtle foreshadowing, although some not to subtle ( Almost used a spoiler as an example, caught myself). I really enjoy the news seasons writing and ability at telling grand adventures, so in that respect the 11th is better. But character wise I liked Tennant, but it is all up to perspective and I am open to any views, because everyone has their own Doctor (/ opinions ).

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; I wear a poppy but I do feel like Remembrance Day is different now than it was when I was a boy.

It is different to when you were a boy - there are fewer people around now that witnessed it.  Anyone under the age of 67 wasn't alive in any of it (only 8m still alive were), you'd have to be 73 (5.2m) to be alive at the beginning of it and at least 83 (1.7m) to be fighting in it (560k still alive were 16 at the beginning of the war - only 157k are men).

The reason that we think it is less important is because there are fewer people alive to remind us of it.  And as our grandparents die we become less bothered by it.  For me it wasn't really about the people who died at war (although it should have been) it was about those who were still alive (and I guess you thought this too).  As those numbers dwindle, we're going to think less and less about it for right or for wrong.

And you seem to conflate people saying it is vandalism and people saying it is morally wrong.  While I agree with most of the Banksy sentiment, modify is a tricky choice of words.  What if, in the example this has all sprung from, there was writing over the text of the original ad, making that illegible.  Now, would that change things? The point I'm trying to make is that you have every right to refute and argue against the ad, but why should you be allowed to remove or censor what they've said? You can join the conversation,and use your own arguments to defeat theirs.  But removing their arguments, their persuasion, is just like shoving your hand over someone's mouth in a debate.  Sure, you have a right to free speech, but so do they.  

Do you disagree with the person who ripped off the 'addition'? Surely they were just modifying?

So how would this 'speech equality' be achieved with ads? With online ads, it's easy: add a comments box.

Why? Because my Grandfather (a Major in The Royal Gurkha Rifles) had a horrific time fighting in Burma against the Japs. When he came home he wanted nothing more to forget about his time in the army and apart from making a monthly donation to the Gurkha Welfare Trust (my grandma still makes a monthly donation to this day) cut all ties. 

I vividly remember him telling me that his experiences with The Royal British Legion were terrible, he called them a bunch of gung-ho idiots who wanted to relive their time at war and called the pomp and pageantry surrounding it sickening. 

My Granddad who was a tank driver in the Royal Logistic Corps, and was much younger at the time than my Grandfather and didn't speak about his experiences at all. However from speaking with my Granny he too distanced himself as much as possible from the army and the RBL as much as possible.

I think if my Grandfather knew about 'Armed Forces Day' he'd be turning in his grave.

He said that he became a pacifist because of the war.

Personally I believe the poppy appeal is part of a military industrial complex propaganda mission. Heaven forbid we criticise the military and the soldiers that fight in it.

He is also required to ensure that his vehicle is, at all times (when on the public highway), roadworthy.

Now it sucks that someone hit his car and drove away, but that's life.  What I do know is that we cannot have non-roadworthy vehicles on the public highway.  The police could remove them to their own private compound, but that would mean that the taxpayer would be subsidising your friend's motoring costs.  Giving the job to a private company, the cost of which your friend can reclaim through his insurance, is a much better solution.  And any money the police receive just goes into deferring their running costs, which means you get a better police service.  So what are you complaining about?

&gt; Without making reasonable effort to notify the owner and/or giving him the opportunity to arrange recovery himself? That's practically extortion.

1. Jose Enrique is simply not good enough. Not attacking, and definitely not defending. And no, the one pass for the Suarez goal is not enough to counter this statement. On the left touchline, he either lost the ball completely or could only manage to kick it off a defender for a throw in, every single time. Wisdom is already leaps better even if his attacking (i.e. crossing) isn't quite up to par yet. 

2. I think I know why Sahin hasn't been as good as we've expected for us: He and Joe Allen are too similar. They both want to switch play, they both want to keep everything ticking along in midfield with simple passes. I'm yet to see either pull off a really nice defense splitting pass for a player to get in behind the defense, ala Cazorla or Mata. This may just be a function of the system Rodgers wants to play, with the 3-pronged attack, but I'd still like to see that type of pass more.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"It's a tricky situation because I think there's some logic to the idea of just ceding midfield and playing direct a la 09/10 but I'm not sure we have the personnel to even do THAT.

It's kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't scenario. We could cede the midfield and play 4-4-2 but we only have 2 first team strikers and I consider it pretty risky to have them both on the pitch. We could keep putting bodies in midfield but then we don't have the type of players to control a game anyway. 

Personally I think a middle ground must be found. I don't think a formation change is the answer, but I think just two changes could help us quite a lot.

1) Adebayor should start. No he wasn't prolific in the air last season but he's a better outlet / target than JD and we can definitely bypass midfield more often with him in the side. 

2) We should stop trying to play out from the back. IMO you need 3 things to do this: a goalkeeper with good feet, a ball-playing central defender, a brave and composed central midfielder. On top of that it helps to have (again, here's that word) composed mobile fullbacks who can push high up the pitch and play combinations. We literally had none of that against Wigan. 

Right now when we play out of the back it really just looks fucking awkward, sort of like pre-Joe Allen Liverpool when they first started playing under Rodgers. Friedel absolutely cannot play with his feet, Caulker and Gallas are both sort of the ""tidy"" half of the CB partnership, and even our best fit midfielder (Sandro...err...wait...he's injured too) isn't the most agile or cool under pressure. 

So what ends up happening? We shape up to play out from the back but end up hoofing it to no one. This invites tons of pressure on us because the CBs are still deep and there is tons of space in midfield.

The perspective of the field sort of condenses things, but [this is more or less the shape teams use when they try to play this way.](http://i.imgur.com/1ZNjX.jpg) 

You can very easily see why it's a high risk high reward concept, particularly when a team presses you. Wigan used a tight front 3 and made it all but impossible to do this yet we kept trying, and if you end up hoofing it while set up in that shape it's pretty obvious it's going to cause all sorts of problems for you. 

There are two teams in England at the MOST who consistently build up like this. Liverpool does it and Swansea does it, though when I've watched the latter this season they're doing it a lot less than they did under Rodgers. 

I have my doubts about whether or not it's even smart for this league. We don't always do it, but we sure as fuck tried it against Wigan and it was horrible. Even fucking Arsenal hoofs it the vast majority of the time and then builds up slowly when they win the ball back. 

It takes a shit ton of bravery and composure from almost the entire squad to build up with split CBs. In other countries it's very common but I just think it takes a lot of time and very specific players to get it to work here. Liverpool are getting better and better with it because it's more or less the cornerstone of their manager's philosophy and they have the players for it. We should stick to pushing everyone high up the pitch and hoofing the damn thing. 

This way we can assume we'll concede possession on most goal kicks and just focus on getting ourselves organized to win the ball back as fast as possible afterwards. 

Sure if it's on we can play out but we shouldn't bother with it when we're under pressure. It just results in giving possession in a dangerous area more often than not. 

Edit: and if you look at our possession numbers this year, we aren't even doing that well. So when we do choose to play this way we aren't really reaping any rewards from it. Luckily we aren't doing it all that often but for whatever reason against Wigan we seemed determined to beat their press when it simply wasn't going to happen.

The Shakespeare Code for the hokey, silly fun of the entire episode and the performance of Shakespeare.  

Gridlock for Brannigan. Really, he makes me smile every time.  

Human Nature and The Family of Blood for the emotional impact it held, showing off more of the Doctor's personality without the alien jargon or plots flying.  

Blink of course, bears mentioning as a highlight of the season, and the trilogy at the end of the season showed off a very enjoyable performance of the Doctor's past relationship and how they stand in the current continuity.

Martha never really, develops during her time as the companion for me. She was perfectly okay, and like I said, I enjoyed the episodes of the season, but there was always another reason coming to mind for why I liked a particular episode, rather than because ""Martha did X and it was brilliant, loved it!""
That may make her the best possible companion then, thinking about it. She gave the audience's voice to ask questions about what zaney plot was afoot, but did not leave a lasting presence herself.

Should I conclude my idle ramblings by saying that this was all my opinion, and it's perfectly reasonable to disagree with them as your opinion?

I'll go ahead and tackle the unasked follow up question as well.

Donna is by far my favorite of the new companions. The most current and yet showcased companion to lead us into the new episodes may give Donna a run for her money to me. But, as it stands, that woman had me in stitches. From the moment Donna's and The Doctor's eyes met across the room in Partner's in Crime, having that nonvocal conversation and that ""Are we interrupting?"" question from Foster, I was very much going ""Oh yes, this will be a good season.""
She had a presence on screen, but is not without her faults. The Forest of the Dead for instance, I greatly dislike as an episode, and she is a very big reason for that opinion.

I really enjoyed Donna's time as the companion, and felt that there was much more... substance, to Donna's and Ten's interactions than Martha showed during her time.

true,akbal7,null,null,"It's a tumbler of players, attitude, pressure, and money.  We need success and TEAM play.  Torres, Sturridge, and Lukaka don't seem to fit the bill on any level.  

Yes, pure strikers need to be selfish, cocky, and confident to succeed.  However, if they don't know when to pass to our crazy talented midfield for an easy score, then they are useless.  If they pout and throw their hands in the air instead of getting back on the ball, they may as well play for the opposing side.

Torres started doing well at the end of last season and began to have some real spark on the ball.  But now he just mopes around the pitch waiting for ""service"" or a chance to flop around (legit or not).  He has the strength to stay on his feet and score, but continues to go to ground.  It makes me wretch, honestly.  He's had his chance and then some.  If he misses any one on one chances or goes to ground without a broken leg, send him back to Liverpool.

Sturridge needs to develop as a team player more.  He gets in some great space, but doesn't quite have the Drogba level strikes we're used to.  Even Drogba passed the ball in the box from time to time.  I've never considered him a pure striker anyway.  If he sticks it our with us, he could take a page out of Lampard's book.

I don't think Lukaka will develop with Chelsea.  He could be a real monster for us, but I think we missed the boat on putting him on first team with the whole Torres debacle.  Being on loan is good for him, but not for his return. I hope I eat those words soon, but my instincts tell me otherwise.  

We do need a true striker, Falcao would be crazy to have, but would push a little poorly on our benched talent and probably cause strife in the locker room.  

All that being said, I think Mata, Hazard, Moses, and Oscar are ALWAYS starting.  The speed, skill, and dominance is key in this year's success.  Since we're stuck with Torres and Sturridge, make them fight it out on a match to match basis.  We need Terry to stay fit and start with Luiz or Cahill.  Luiz must stay back and in control...no more running all the way to goal for they hell of it.   We must have our defense on LOCKDOWN for the entire match.  No matter who we play.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"I am disappointed to see that BR isn't playing him very much, but I think he could fit very well into BR's Liverpool.  It is true that he is rarely noticeable when he plays, but this doesn't only correspond to a lack of a positive impact, but to a lack of mistakes as well.  For a 22-year-old, this demonstrates good discipline and a good, or at least a potentially good, footballing mind.

Henderson isn't flashy, but that doesn't mean he is a bad player.  It doesn't even mean that he's not (at the very least, potentially) a Liverpool class player.  Hendo passes the ball.  He isn't brilliant at it, but he knows his limitations, and doesn't try to make passes that he's unlikely to be able to pull off.  Instead, he makes a good pass nine times out of ten, rather than give away possession.  When he does see an opening, though, he'll exploit it.  His vision is pretty damn good, as is his positioning.  See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyZ5vbo-D_o) at 0:39, his assist to Jonjo against YB, or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE9T46YamvQ) at 1:53.

He's also versatile, and a hard worker.  In his time at Liverpool, he's played in the middle, in a holding position, at right back, and at right wing, and, despite failing to impress in any of the positions, he's done a solid job in all of them.  (There's an argument that he didn't as a right wing, I suppose, but that's not that important to the overall question.)  He doesn't complain about not being picked; instead he works harder to get into the team.  He's a very coachable player, and if BR can bring him up right, he'll become very good (I hope).

And finally, Hendo has excellent technique on the ball.  Keepy-uppy's, crossbar challenge, and his highlight reel (though it's small at Liverpool) demonstrate this.  Try 1:25 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EA5O5whfAs) for instance.  Or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdVmGhrVq5s).  Composure is a big part of his game as well: see his two PL goals for Liverpool- calm, collected finishing.  Or that time he hit the inside of the post with a very well-placed shot against Fulham (?- not sure of opposing team).

All in all, I see not reason not to keep him.  You don't become the England U-21 captain for no reason.  He's going to be a damn good footballer someday, and I hope it's for us.

I don't really see how it could be any different, the limitations of under 18's means that their labour is supposedly less useful than yours. Paying them the same as you doesn't make much sense, whether you lower or raise the wages to meet each other.  The minimum wage exists for a very very good reason, and that is to stop jobs becoming impossible to support yourself on. I don't think its high enough, personally. You don't want to sell yourself short by working for less. Your labour is worth a minimum standard of pay.

The problem here for me is that employers are being underhanded in only going for minors because they are cheaper. Typically these menial jobs are very fast turnover. Even with adults, they assume that you will go and find a better job ASAP, so why bother paying more to train someone who isn't going to stick around, when they can pay less for near enough the same results.

Its stupid, and dumb. The problem is indeed the job market. That you have to go for these jobs in the first place, and you ARE less employable than a teenager because you are overqualified.

He came across as rather awkward and childish (in a good sort of way) and it worked very well for the more humorous writing we've been seeing from Smith's seasons. 

I found it strangely difficult to grow attached to the Eleventh Doctor for a while, probably due to the fact that their was no connecting characters (like Rose). Not to mention their was a much greater personality difference between Ten and Eleven than there was between Nine and Ten (in my opinion). Though as the seasons passed I began to get more in touch with the Doctor, his new characters, and the new pacing of the show. He does an absolutely fantastic job at playing the Doctor and I think he's a little more 'Doctory' (strange/alien) than Ten which works really well.

The reason why we have a different minimum wage for under 18s is to make it attractive to businesses to hire young people who in turn get great experience. 

The argument is made that under 18s don't actually need to work as they are provided for by their families and in some cases the state.

Now this isn't the case for all under 18s, some of who work full time and who don't depend on their family for support.

Maybe if we were to change the under 18 minimum wage to being means tested rather than an age cut off point it would be better?

My own personal experience working under the age of 18 was great. I worked as a dishwasher/kitchen porter/preparer for a local Indian restaurant for fives years whilst at secondary school and college. It was good pay (twice the minimum wage for my age), but bloody hard work. It was also good fun and I got to learn about a different country and its culture, Bangladesh. I even learnt some of the language and was invited to join in Eid al-Fitr. Plus, I got to take home a freshly cooked Indian each night I worked (Friday and Saturday).

Allen is not supposed to be a ball winner like Lucas is. But he distributes well. It is not necessarily about him playing it forward, it is about him playing it to somebody who can play it forward. 

One can imagine the following: Allen picks it up from Agger (who is on the left side of the defence). Allen sends it sideways to Johnson running up on the right who plays it to Sterling. 

Allen is not about making the killer pass, but more conducting the possession play which BR wants to play.

I was in a bit of a rush posting the original add and have been in Amsterdam for the past while and hadn't looked at my reddit account. 

Just to give as much info as possible:

This is a sales job. It is commission only but the commission is excellent. The job entitles setting up in shopping centres, at events and doing business to business work selling paintball tickets. I know this doesn't sound very lucrative but it is seriously the best job I've ever had and as a young open minded traveller I consider myself extremely lucky to have been given all of the opportunity I have.

Within two months of starting with the company I was given my own team, a company house where my staff and myself live and company cars to drive. I have been sent all over the UK to work with people who live the same party lifestyle as myself and have even been sent on paid vacations to Pamplona and Ibiza over the course of the summer. They have sent other staff skydiving, whitewater rafting and on countless days out to theme parks etc.

There is absolutely no risk in trying it out if you are interested. If you apply for the job online you would be contacted by our recruitment department and will be asked to come do an orientation followed by an observation day where you can spend a few hours with one of the teams to see if you like the job. If you're not keen then obviously don't stick it out. Anyone who tries it will know within the first week whether or not the job is for them.

The only thing I ask is that if you do apply for the job that you say you heard about it from me, **Jeff MacDonald** :) as the recruitment bonus is pretty sweet as well!

The hours are flexible, the people are a blast and the payoff is great in both money and experiences.

I'll be much more prompt on further replies if you guys have any more questions.

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"We must be watching different players because I see the opposite in Allen.

1) He is big for our team because he is our metronome, he keeps us clicking. His passes and timing are what maintain our tempo.

2) His forward passes are actually quite good, he has just been off the last game or two. I think he has been playing to many games tbh. He has come from Swansea where he plays 1 game a week, maybe 2 every now and then, to Liverpool where he is playing 2 a week nonstop.  He can do some great.  He isn't being allowed his normal position though which hampers his passing.

3) He is great at tackling and I feel wins it more than not. He is slight of frame no doubt but is constantly taking the ball out from other players feet. If he doesn't get the ball he makes a great nuisance of himself and often screws up whoever is trying to pass allowing us to win it back. He struggled with Fellaini no doubt but usually he is spot on.

4) He is not playing in his natural position. He is currently our defensive midfielder but that isn't his normal position, he is just the closest thing we have right now to a defensive midfielder.  I think he is more of a box-to-box midfielder who supplements attack and the defense.  [He is a capable scorer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nVGBk_lnt0)

Think of it this way:

In an ideal world we would play 

  When Attacking:

----Gerrard-----Allen-----

----------Lucas----------

When Defending:

-------Gerrard------

---Lucas---Allen----


5) I think the most important thing to keep in mind is Joe Allen is not a world-class midfielder who is gonna come on and Gerrard a game, he isn't that kind of player.

Then by that token, commercially viable solar is fantasy. As is commercially viable tidal and wind, all of which are heavily subsidised by the state. 

You must also think that China has just invested $350 million in a fantasy 10MW LFTR reactor, for completion by 2020, announced only yesterday. And that Russia, the US, Japan, France and the UK have all invested 12 billion in a fantasy which is being built in Southern France. 

Warp Drives are fantasy. Space elevators are fantasy. If you've actually broken ground and started building it, it's not fantasy. If you know the exact engineering problems you need to solve, it's not a fantasy. 

&gt; If you think fusion energy will ne available in 2020, what about the infrastructure required to implement it as part of the industrial complex? What if the energy required to implement it is too expensive or scarce to build new systems?

Right. So you didn't actually read the link, then. Reading up on the future of the human race too much of a big ask, was it? Because I live in eternal hope that the willfully ignorant might one day try and learn something, here is another link, this time right to the [timeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Timeline_and_current_status). The switch on is 2020, when the first plasma reactions are achieved. The deuterium-tritium burning probably won't happen until several years in.

As for ""the infrastructure"" - what makes you think that the infrastructure for these reactors isn't already there? What is it you think we don't have, exactly? A grid? Roads? Enough concrete? Why do you think that we won't have enough energy to build large buildings within 8 years? What is it you expect to happen within 8 years time? And do you have any evidence for it?

Or are you just reaching?

What they are doing is Community Service. In the uk that has variously been called Community Payback and (now) Unpaid Work but they are all the same. Basically if a court orders you to do it (usually 50-300 hours) you have to turn up once a week to probation where they put you to work on various projects. 

The projects are supposed to be of benefit to the community and things that otherwise would not get done. For example clearing ditches, painting a house for a disabled person, renovating a community centre etc. 

ASBOs (anti social behaviour orders) are a thing that can be imposed on people without taking them to court and without the person breaking the law. For example a common asbo that was imposed was put on street drinkers, not to be drunk in a public place. It's rather unfair because in theory if they break it they can get sent to prison for up to five years, without having broken any actual laws!

Local authorities got a bit silly with ASBOs including a woman who was banned from answering the door in her underwear and a man from Liverpool who was banned from being sarcastic. Yes really. The prisons are crowded enough without this silliness. So they have stopped imposing them now. 

ASBOs at their height became something of a badge of honour to a certain type of youth who might enjoy a bit of small-time notoriety. 
If a character mentions having an asbo this is something separate from their community service. If you give me a specific example I may be able to explain more if needed.

Correct. There is no serious strategy in rich countries to implement solar, wind or tidal energy generating technologies and plug them into the industrial system, as far as I'm aware. 

I think it's more likely that energy is going to be scarce in the near future and sea levels higher.

My boldage. 

&gt;As for ""the infrastructure""...

On the assumption that oil is running out and will become expensive, you will have to change the infrastructure so that anything that now uses oil can run on electricity instead. 

Also, electricity can't substitute all the other stuff oil does with like agriculture and plastics and all that. You'll need to change all the transport technology to electric, if the feasibility of the fusion reactors is demonstrated in 2020 (how long does it take to build more reactors once they have been shown to work, a decade from now? Are they safe?). 

&gt;Or are you just reaching?

I'm reaching for the keys to my tractor but I remember it doesn't run because only the super rich can afford petrol and the conversion of their internal combustion vehicles to electric.

You are then still donating to a good cause ( although even the BL has had it's own controversy) but not confirming to something you are not entirely happy/comfortable with, i.e wearing the poppy. This is what I do, because the poppy has become something people feel they *should* do, or have to do so as to fit in with social norms and not have the accusing looks from others. People should wear a poppy if they want to, not because of social obligation. Wearing one should not determine whether you remember those who have fallen, people can remember them however they want to. 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/12jhuy/why_i_choose_not_to_wear_a_poppy_huffington_post/c6vqetd?context=3) was an interesting view on another poppy related thread, from dayus9

&gt;Every year there are articles from both sides. Some of them telling us why the writer doesn't wear one, some telling us that the writer does, some even try to shame people into doing the same.
I'm in the military, I choose to wear a poppy. I don't give a shit if anyone else does, it's personal choice.
I don't know why these bell ends (on both sides) think I should care why they make this choice.

Until very recently, I was in the same position. I have a post-graduate qualification, and was unemployed for months. I was even rejected from Tesco, which was interesting to say the least. I ended up wondering why I'd done 5 years of tertiary education if I couldn't even get a supermarket job. It's crap being unemployed, frankly.

But just last week I got three job offers. Bugger all for months, then three offers in a week. I'm due to start a decent graduate job soon. But I also got two offers for retail jobs which I'd applied for just to get me some money.

Point being - don't give up hope. It's crap seeing younger and less experienced people get jobs. It gets pretty damn depressing doing application after application. But you're well educated, and you can find yourself a job. A friend of mine got a job recently after nearly two years of unemployment.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I'm sure you'll agree that there were non-believers who fought in the world wars (and pretty much all battles etc.) yet I doubt that any (dunno for sure, would have to check by visiting) overseas graves weren't marked with a religious symbol - default being a cross of some kind. I wonder how many non-religious graves there are... certainly not as many as there were non-religious soldiers. It's 'assumed', both then and now, that you'll be wanting Christian bits and pieces.

You remember the Cumbria shootings? The daughter of one of the dead remarked early on that her father was a Humanist, yet the service for remembering the dead was held in a church. I'll wager his family weren't consulted, nor was it given a 2nd thought that anything else should be done.

The notion that ""it works very well"" is slightly back to front though - almost Catch22ish - I think. We have a situation where ceremonies have been taken over by religious groups (even if the majority were religious at the time remember some weren't and now it's getting so that most aren't religious at all, not actively) and so now it's the 'default' and we don't know any different. How do we know that a secular Remembrance day wouldn't 'work'? The only way we'd know is if we remove the religious elements, but we can't do that because people think that ""it works well"". While churches might be suited as gathering or focal points, there are alternatives that are equally solemn.     

With regard to perhaps 'reforming' such things, [here's a link about Humanists not being allowed to have representation at Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph](http://www.politics.co.uk/opinion-formers/bha-british-humanist-association/article/bha-non-religious-excluded-from-official-remembrance-day-com).

I realize that some (most?) people will think this is being nit-picky and getting annoyed about something trivial, but consider this: Would you be 'alright' with general public ceremonies being held in a Temple, or a Mosque, or a Synagogue, or for Remembrance day to be lead by an Imam or Rabbi who conducts the ceremony entirely along Muslim or Jewish or Sikh lines? Why not: Because it is not relevant to most people, or not something that that plays any part in their life.     
The way in which people might feel affronted (for want of a better word... maybe confused or bemused?) by a Muslim or Jew heading a ceremony like Remembrance day is the same way I (and others) feel about a Christian doing it. *Why* must there be a religious element? It's irrelevant to most of us!

Yes, I realize that those are not the ""historical religion"" of the UK and that the majority of people of faith in this country are Christian, but actively religious Christians are *not* in the majority in the UK any longer. Religion is, more or less, an afterthought in the minds of the general populace.

Secondly, we can be absolutely sure that they don't have the number of warheads needed for MAD where the USA is concerned, just because of the size of the USA. You need thousands of warheads for that. However most nuclear nations believe that you don't need to threaten to completely destroy your enemy to have a deterrent, you just need to threaten to inflict some loss that they would find unacceptable. We have something like 180 warheads. That's not enough to exterminate the population of Russia, unlike the American arsenal. However if the Russians did attempt an invasion, most of those warheads would be launched in one salvo, and they would take out many cities and military resources.

I understand that addiction is a real problem, but people seem to have an ability to get addicted to just about anything, good or bad. If people get addicted then it is their fault for letting it get to that point. No-one forced them to go in the first time, or the second, etc.

If someone wants to bet £10 on a spin, because they have the money, and it would be boring to bet anything less, then they should be allowed, not prevented to do so just because some idiot spunked their savings up the wall chasing losses.

If the government really feel the need to intervene, how about teaching probability properly in maths classes. As a keen student of maths, by the time I was in Sixth Form I fully understood what the risk was and that any money you gamble is money spent on your enjoyment, not an investment for a return. Probability lessons in school should teach about gambling, about the gambler's fallacy and the gambler's ruin. An added bonus is that kids would be less likely to find maths so boring if they had some sort of real life application.

The machines state the average return for the customer, there are leaflets warning against gambling addiction which have to be put in view and employees are even expected to intervene when they feel that someone's addicted.

I have a lot of respect for my dad and others like him in the civil service so I'll tell you a bit about what he has done. 

 He was head of several departments (it's strange in the civil service they have X department which is made up of A, B, C, and D departments which in turn may be made of even more) and amongst other things was in charge of fraud and complaints  for a number of years which is something he *loved* - he was forced to recommend the implementation of the computers inside jobcentres which was a unpopular move at the time because of widespread corruption, people who worked there were not putting the jobs up on the boards and keeping them back for friends and families (given that one of his department's jobs was to deal with getting employers to put up the jobs in the first place this annoyed him somewhat). So they *were* listening and did/still do take complaints very seriously. I've seen the bags of mail (now most e-mail) and there is a team who just go through each and every complaint and follow it up, they rotate people though so they don't end up going insane.

 One of his last acts before he switched to a different department within the DOE was to implement the removal of the glass windows from Jobcentres. When the strikes happened my dad actually went down and signed people on and really enjoyed listening to the customers (another of his ideas, he was all about not making people feel like shit) talk about how much better the jobcenteres were now than they were back in the day, it was kind of the pay off for his entire career. I spoke to him about the strikers and said ""if they didn't want to get punched in the face then they shouldn't treat people like rubbish then, and if they don't like it then anyone in the queue would have their jobs in a heartbeat"" my dad simply said: ""you might say that, I couldn't possibly comment""  ",0,1352157684,null,0,false,0,c6wydkc,t3_12ohn9,t1_c6wydkc,t1_c6wxt1l,null,1430329465,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That was the exact opposite of not making a fuss. He obviously did fear and did care and did everything in his power to escape it. In order to do so he had to manipulate River Song into helping him. In order to do that, he had to impress and surprise her first. 

The Doctor is a master of manipulation, you cannot take anything he does as regular, it nearly always has intent. 

As for your comments on five. I do believe some companion died before Adric? Can't remember who. Was it Ian?

At any rate, it did haunt him yes. Just like all the other companions lost over the years have haunted the Doctor, otherwise. I think it was just on of the first times he was confronted with the human/timelord difference. That he would live on while they would all perish. 

I think he'll definitely bring them up, but I doubt he'll be haunted by it. Five was primarily haunted, imo, because it was such a new experience as well as the fact that he believed it was entirely his fault that he died. Plus, no closure whatsoever.

With Eleven, though, he knows they lived long and happy lives. He even has a last message addressed to him and can visit a younger version of them one more time. That's a big difference right there.

Except the first bomb they set off in New York would be a first strike weapon. I'm not sure they would really flock to their Leader after he brings this destruction upon them.

&gt; Also consider that Iran has seen Iraq (no nuclear weapons) invaded, and North Korea (has nuclear weapons) left alone.

Because North Korea negotiated, you think if they ever used them against the US they'd have been left alone? The key here to staying alive is not using the weapons. The moment they do they're fucked.

&gt; As to getting a couple of bombs in to the US - more or less trivial. If you wanted to attack New York, for instance, you stick it in a ship and detonate it in situ, so it never even clears customs. You can't get a lot of bombs in without being found out, which is why the big nuclear states don't use this approach, but the risk of discovery for one or two bombs is pretty low.

Probably not quite as easy as it sounds:

Yes. And it does that by producing more energy than it consumes - thats what a prototype fusion reactor is for. What did you think it did, exactly?

As for the rest of your comment, it relies on a number of things being true (again, you're cherry picking absolute worst case). 

1) That the price of energy, per KWH, increases immeasurably over the next decade, making large scale construction projects impossible. 

2) No energy technology projects, renewable or nuclear, deliver on decreased cost, ease of implementation, experimental investment, or production efficiency in the next decade, breaking a century long trend. 

3) No oil resources coming on line in the next ten years actually deliver on the amount of oil they were expected to deliver. 

4) No increase in fuel efficiency for vehicles.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The council means the local government. We have 'council housing', 'community housing' and 'housing association' homes in the UK. They're all kinda the same except the latter is usually a charity that local councils contract out to (when they can't provide enough housing of their own) and community housing is specifically for people that have a disability etc and require extra help. They are all available on the welfare state, paid for by UK taxation. Often these houses and flats are for people with little-to-no income because they don't work or don't earn very much. The people that don't work receive fortnightly welfare payments from their local government that are anywhere upwards of about £55 per week, depending on your situation. They are usually exempt from council tax (the tax we pay upon our properties - whether you own or rent them) or it is heavily discounted and extra benefits (called housing benefits) are paid out additionally to help cover all or part of the rent. The rent is traditionally VERY low in these properties.


There isn't much room in very built up areas, so flats or 'high rises' are common. In smaller cities, the estates tend to be terraced - but not the kind you have in your pictures. They tend to be grey, concrete fronted 70's builds with typically around 3 bedrooms. Smaller flats etc exist for single people. Most of the kinds of houses you included a pic of were built as council housing in the 40s, (post war) or as factory housing in the early 20s (and later bought by councils) but were sold on to tenants for reduced prices in the 80s. These homes are now more commonly populated by upper-working-class families.

Thamesmead is a real place in London and it is pretty much as grim as it looks. In London, the city is divided by the river Thames and, typically, the south side is known to be the poorer side with high gun crime, low employment rates etc. Thamesmead is south of the river.

An ASBO is an Anti Social Behavioral Order, its just a blight on your record. Typically it is accompanied by a 'tag' which alerts the local police if you leave the house after your court-imposed curfew. Usually these are active 7 days of the week. Not all ASBOs are accompanied by a tag, nor are they all accompanied by community service. It could be one, the other, a combination, or something else entirely.
Similarly, a tag does not always indicate that you have an ASBO!

It's difficult to say, but my guess is that most of them are just plain unemployed - they're in council housing as a result of this.

Aston Villa need to have 10 outfield players on the pitch for the full 90 minutes, working together as a team for that 90 minutes. Darren Bent is a luxury player who you can afford to have on the pitch for 90 minutes when you are creating other chances. Seen as Villa aren't creating chances left right and center we cant rely on the 'possibility' Bent will get his toe on the end of something. Therefore imo he should be sold and IF we got 12-14million for him we could get maybe a couple of decent players in.

true,captainlavender,smith,Smith,"I still love nine! Okay, sorry, had to say that. Also obligatory: for those who love fan theories and analysis, check out r/gallifrey which is only self-posts about Who. 

I agree with what people are saying, that ten vs. eleven is really a perfect example of apples vs. oranges. Ten was a shepherd, more obviously emotive and attached to his companions, full of love for humanity and sometimes morose/in need of cheering up. With Ten (and Nine, really) the show was serial in nature (I hesitate to say, super-serial?), unselfconsciously dramatic and ""big"", colorful and full of characters and humor that sometimes worked really well, sometimes not at all. Lots of risks. Three distinct acts per episode, usually ending triumphantly. There's more I could say, but I suppose I should cut myself off. I will add this -- the one thing I never bought from Ten was cold rage. The timelord victorious, yes, because that is Ten going kind of off the deep end and abusing his power almost naively. But the cold anger we see in Family of Blood... eh. (I doubt this is a popular opinion.) 

Eleven is mischievous, alien, crotchety (you know it's true), and plays up his silliness while holding his emotions very close to the chest, so to speak. Definitely less relatable -- not so much a protagonist (Ten) as a very unreliable narrator and guide. Much more prone to antics, shenanigans and inexplicable lunacy, often an obvious ploy to distract people from himself or from questions he doesn't want to answer. Consequently, when his true feelings come out it feels quite jarring, sudden bursts of anger or angst which I at first disliked but in retrospect find very effective. Other people have said the opposite, but one thing I very much believe is his wrath. Think of the speech when he renamed the colonel mid season-6 (trying not to spoil haha) -- when I remember his final lines, they are *scary*. Tennant could have a temper but he was human, sympathetic; we knew he wouldn't let his wrath lead him into some terrible mistake (he's ""the man who never would""). Smith? Uh-oh.

But of course the show's stylistic shift is even more dramatic than the Doctor changeup. Complex arcs that sometimes work brilliantly and sometimes become muddled or lose the viewer. Less bombast. More driving questions and secrets. If RTD era was ""every week a new adventure"" Moffat's era would be ""the mystery unfolds"". Either way, I definitely get Ten's point that it's ""a different man"" who walks away. I guess, in short (too late), Ten was a father, mostly human with Timelord tendencies, whereas Eleven is the batty old uncle, mostly alien but with a pronounced fondness for we homo sapiens.

true,jvdbization,lfc68,,"I think Suarez has a legitimate chance of winning the golden boot this year.  And I DONT entirely see that as a good thing.  Here's why: Its an understatement to say we depend too much on him, but given his nature and the treatment he receives from refs (sometimes earned, mostly not), he tallies quite a few yellow cards, puts his body through hell, and we WILL have to figure out ways to score without him.  

Yes Suarez is one of the most incredible strikers on earth, but I feel like the team has sort of taken a shape that gives him too much responsibility.  Hes the single sword with which we bleed out our enemies... 

Multiple times vs. Newcastle Suarez was isolated in a strange way, he wasn't alone, he had ""support"" all around him... a line of guys outside the box who all looked like they were just a bunch of sidekicks to get the ball to Suarez, then watch what he does with it.  We NEED someone like Huntelaar to be a full time threat like Suarez.  And that means Suarez gets less chances on goal, and may score less, but the chances he does get matter more because he has a partner there to back him and clean up the leftovers of the carnage he creates.

That's really what I see when Suarez carves into the defense, its pure carnage, the bodies just start falling right and left, grown men cry, assholes bleed, the earth opens up into a chasm of fire.. But when he is on his knees with one last man to slaughter, he needs a Huntelaar to launch off his crouched back with spear in hand, ready to befell the final foe.  Hmm, somehow I'm in a scene of 300 now. 

TLDR: We need another striker.  Not just a depth man.  A world class striker, to really get the best out of Suarez and the entire team.  I think once Suarez has a true partner who can share the load and help finish in the final 3rd, it will become apparent that the rest of the team is pretty well sorted.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I wish Suarez wouldn't leave us, but the fact that none of our team is comparable to Suarez must be very frustrating for him. He's worked magic time and time again only to find himself the only one in the box. Recent history already show our strikers leaving for better clubs (Torres to Chelsea, Owen to Madrid). They all end up being flops, or at least for a while. If Suarez does leave us, I'm pretty sure he too will be a flop unless he leaves to Germany/Spain, since it seems like no English club fans like him.

I'm not sure if Suarez is enjoying himself at Liverpool at the moment. He's constantly the subject of controversial matters even when he's playing clean, the receipient of denied penalties, and of course, the magician among our team, who cannot seem to even match his level. I feel bad for him, really. He's the sort of player who should be winning the Ballon D'Or, with his skill. And yet he's stuck in a team with people around him not performing to standard. We've saw how frustrated he was when Sterling went for the goal instead of passing it to him against Everton, we saw how frustrated he was against Newcastle when he received the ball after the Newcastle goal (was it?) and half-heartedly tried to direct it towards goal.

All this talk about youth growing and waiting one or two years is good and all. The fans can wait, BR probably can wait, but I don't think Suarez can.

We need to bring in a good, competent striker, and produce results **fast**, or we're going to lose talent. Suso signed a 3 year contract, that's his contract expiring when he's 21~22, still a very young age. Obviously, we'll need results to keep him here. I'm unsure when Suarez's contract ends, but seeing his frustration right now, we better produce results and keep him, or we'll suffer **hard**. Not only because Suarez is single-handedly carrying us right now, but also because without Suarez, I doubt anyone would want to come to Liverpool, as it is nothing without Suarez. I can't imagine what would happen if he got injured instead of Borini. Borini would be out there playing as much as Suarez would have but he would never score half the amount of goals Suarez has scored.",0,1352181110,null,0,false,0,c6x4n92,t3_12ogej,t1_c6x4n92,t3_12ogej,null,1430332485,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

THIS is the best example I could use for people when they ask why a player would want to come to the prem or Liverpool, Suarez has become a global Super star (or at least universally accepted as world class) here in a matter of 1-2 seasons.

I know this because the odd time I work from home he generally gets up at 8.30 to sit on the back step to smoke weed. Which he then does till 10 at night, so in summer my apt smells of weed. Not sure if this helps my case for a tenant. 

Anyway i'm both a bit jealous and also annoyed that taxation gets this guy a chance to live in relative luxury and get high all day when it costs me a ton.

My point was he could easily sit at home all day somewhere else.

I can also understand why the government wants to do this. In many areas the police no longer have support even within middle England as they simply don't respond to the worries of the populous. The Police can be incredibly inept at times, and show a lack of interest in the crime that really hurts people because it is low level, non glamous stuff. I suspect that the senior Police much prefer attending high powered conferences about terrorism or organised crime than actually spending their time worrying about their patch.
