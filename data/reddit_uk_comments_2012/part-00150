true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; And remember, the decisions don't just change the scoreline, they change the whole mentality of the players and therefore the outcome of the match.

Fair point, but if we try to account for that then it becomes far too speculative. Either way, talking about where we'd be in the table is a little bit semantical, and we both agree that our performances have been better than the points accrued.

&gt; We should've won that game, and were incredibly unlucky not to.

Agreed, but I wouldn't base United's style off that one game, because Ferguson has traditionally played very cautiously at Anfield. I'd still say that United are playing better football, because even if it's not as technically pretty as ours, it's effective, and for the first time in a while they have interesting tactical variation (4-4-2 with wingers or a diamond).

&gt; remove Mata, and they're nothing. 

*Shrugs* I think Oscar and Hazard would disagree with you there, while Ramires is still effective in an advanced role. Mata's a key part, no doubt, and is in great form at the moment, but to go so far as to say ""they're nothing"" is a disservice - Mata was there last season as well, but his form this season is even better, and that's because Chelsea's football is even better.

&gt; Their players are generally getting to the age where they can't really develop much more, whereas ours still have at least 2-3 years. Obviously, players keep developing throughout their career, but I mean by the time you're 22/23/24/25 you're at your physical &amp; mental peak as a player

I disagree - look at Glen Johnson and Martin Skrtel from when they signed to where they are now, have they not improved? Was Lucas at his physical &amp; mental peak at 22? You're right that our youngsters are even younger and thus could have a lot of potential to improve, but that also means they're also many more years off reaching their peak, when it's a shorter-term level of promise we need to be looking at so we can get back into the CL next season or the season after.

Only Sterling's been 'world class'; Wisdom was exposed yesterday against Mirallas, in his first big test, and Suso drifts in and out of games. I'm not criticizing them, because they've done exceptionally better than any of us thought they would.

&gt; I'm being 100% honest when I say this is the first time in a good 5-6 years that I genuinely believe we can win the league in the near future.

I agree with you that this has the makings of a team that can win the league, but it's early days (and we probably disagree on how soon it could happen). A lot of that's because, with Rodgers, things are a lot more stable and organised than they've been at this club for a while.

If West Country Cheddar has a good reputation for quality, why should someone else be allowed to trade off that reputation, or even damage it, by claiming to be West Country when they aren't.

The flip side is that cheddar is a generic term, a type of cheese. It is made all over the world, it tells people roughly what type of cheese to expect. It would be ridiculous to try to say that all cheddar had to be made in the Cheddar region. I've had excellent cheddar from all sorts of places.

Maybe the ancient Ottoman empire would make a better role model, where a successful man could expect to have a harem of women at his disposal in an enclosure where all other men are forbidden to go. The Ottoman empire was a segment of the Roman empire which survived centuries beyond the fall of Rome.  

Or perhaps the spartan method where all young men live and fuck together in the barracks and women are used solely for procreation, having their heads shaved right before marriage to make the transition from men to women easier on the guys. The Spartans were some of the hardiest soldiers ever seen, after all.

Back in the middle ages all the way through the Renaissance and up until fairly recent times across Europe women were expected to marry and start providing children as early as 12, or as soon as the first period came. 

My point is that we don't actually have thousands of years of monogamous history to fall back on. Hell, the nuclear family itself has only existed for about 100-200 years. Until then grandparents and were expected to live in the same household as the kids and help with childrearing, cooking and whatever else they could still do.

You haven't got a fucking clue. You're basing your entire argument on free education and cheaper house prices?

Yeah it was great - 3.1m unemployed even though the population was 10m less than now, 30% basic rate income tax with only £1500 a year tax free, 13-17% mortgage interest rates for over a decade so even though the house prices were cheap you couldn't afford to pay the mortgage. No tax credits, no child tax credits, child benefit for the second child only so if your parents were on a shit wage you got no help from the govt and you had the take home pay to live on no matter how little it was. If you had a family with kids and both parents earned £100 a week each, £42 of that would disappear instantly in income tax leaving them just over £160 a week to pay all the bills and live on whether they had one kid or 10 kids whereas now the govt will give you about £4000 per child in tax credits. If the kids needed a school uniform, that would cost £18 per child - over 10% of what they had to live on. A cheap pair of jeans from the market was £10. You can buy a school uniform from Asda today for £10 and a pair of jeans for under a fiver. Food was more expensive than it is now. Child poverty far worse than it is now. 

Double glazing was only just starting to appear in houses and few had central heating, loft insulation wasn't that common either. Waking up in the middle of winter to ice on the inside of your bedroom window wasn't anything unusual. 

Plenty of power cuts either from strikes or failing distribution network through the govt cutting spending on the publicly owned electricity network.

Schools and hospitals falling down around our ears as successive governments slashed investment. 

Uni education was free but fewer people could afford to go - you had to work and contribute to the household so for many people they couldn't go to uni even if they wanted to. Far more people per capita go now than ever did back then.

And if you got a job there was no such thing as NMW. If someone wanted to pay you 60p an hour as a grown adult they could and they did.

Shops were open 9-5 Mon-Fri usually with half day closing on a Wednesday or Thursday and half day Saturday opening for some.

When I left home in the mid 80's, me and my girlfriend ended up living on the dole for a short while - £22 for both of us to live on for a fortnight and we had to pay towards the rent out of that. Stuff cost less but not that much less. 

So just what do you think was better?

I think that the thing behind the door was the destruction of the TARDIS. The worse thing in the universe for the Doctor would be the final and irrevocable destruction of the TARDIS. It represents, to him, the destruction of the last link he has with his Time Lord past, and worse, because he is still alive, just trapped forever in the normal time stream, the worst fate possible for a Time Lord.

This is why, at least for me, the moment when he [spoiler](#s ""pulled out the TARDIS fragment from the crack in 'Cold Blood' was such a showstopping moment"").

EDIT:

Actually, I've just thought of a worse thing than the destruction of the TARDIS for the Doctor to have to face. The abandonment of the Doctor *by* the TARDIS, because he is so far lost from what he originally set out to be, that 'she' can no longer bear to be with him any more.

Not only does this work on the level described above, where he loses his last link to his Time Lord past, but it is his own fault. He has become that which he fears the most. Himself, but without his 'humanity'. This works even more so when you consider the fact that 'she' chose him in the first place. Also, if you note the episode title (The God Complex), which is not just referring to the Minotaur creature, but the Doctor himself.

* She set up the ideological framework which UK politics still uses today.

In addition to chili: bbq pork shoulder (one lasts a whole week for the two of us), beef and vegetable stew, whole roast chicken, etc. You can do a million things, almost all of which reheat well. If you prep on Sunday, you're golden.

Along the same lines, a large breakfast casserole can be your best friend. In a deep pan or pyrex, layer sausage, cream cheese, onion, and red pepper; cover with egg and sprinkle cheese on top. Cook for 40 minutes and you have a great, easily reheatable casserole that lets you have a hot breakfast every day (frugally)!

Sissoko -. Ah what happened to this man. Him and M'villa were suppose to be the next best things as DMs. Haven't seen him recently, so I have no idea how he's doing, but again, We are good at CM, so I dont think we need him either.


Honda - I would love us to sign Honda. Quality player and I think he would be great on the wings or as the attacking player of the midfield 3. I rate him very highly. Would also make sense marketing wise. Would love us to get him.


Carrico - I have never heard of him before to be honest, so I have no opinion. But he's a CB, so I don't think we need another CB.


Vargas - Has there been a window when we have not been linked with him? I rate him. He's good, but at 31, he doesn't fit FSGs policy so I highly doubt we would be interested.


Kuzmanovic - another player I have not heard of. Would love it if someone could fill me in on him and Carrico.


Douglas - I don't think he's top quality. Good for the dutch league, but not Liverpool standard imo. Again a CB, whcih we dont need, and if we did need one I think we'd need a much better player than douglas.


Huntelaar - Being 29 is the only thing that I think will deter us. He's the type of player we need. Lethal, strong, but, he might not be mobile enoughf or BR to want him. Just my opinion though. Would love to sign him though.


Llorente - well, at 23 I think Carroll is better. I don't want us to sign Llorente ( I will probably be in the minority here, but please, feel free to tell me why I'm wrong)

Holtby - Exactly the type of player we want. Very clever player.

With Doctor Who, you still have the driving narrative of the doctor. The entire series doesn't need to be re-established because a new actor has assumed the role. The same happens with James Bond. Whether or not the Misfits cast actors to play characters that fill the same group dynamic, the driving narrative of the series as it once was is gone, and now must be created more or less from scratch. 

Now, whether or not the show will be good with whatever the new direction has yet to be seen. I, for one, am not interested in becoming invested in an entirely new story, especially one that could flip flop in another season or two.

Actually, we do still need a 'true' DM as cover/rotation for Lucas. Allen's doing great, but he's not playing as a sole DM, he's generally got Gerrard alongside him, whereas when Lucas comes back it's likely he'll be the sole DM, allowing Gerrard to get further forward. I'm not saying it should be Sissoko, but equally, we're not ""good"" in midfield yet.

&gt; Llorente - well, at 23 I think Carroll is better. I don't want us to sign Llorente ( I will probably be in the minority here, but please, feel free to tell me why I'm wrong)

It depends how you measure it - Carroll is probably better in the air than Llorente, because Carroll on his day is one of the most beastly physical centre forwards in the world. But Llorente provides better link-up play and passing, and is much more intelligent with his movement (as well as being a bit more mobile), both of which are more important to Rodgers than aerial dominance (else Carroll would not have left).

And re: Walcott, why? My issues with Walcott are that he's too one-dimensional - he has pace, and that's essentially it. He hasn't developed significantly at Arsenal, and if Wenger can't develop a player then that says something about that player's footballing intelligence. Walcott can't cross, only provide cut-backs; he's not the best tracking back or pressing, which we need from our wingers, and he's not the best passer of the ball. (To his credit, he can score goals as a winger.)

And on top of all that, he won't come cheap because he's young and English; even if we got him on a pre-contract to sign as a Bosman at the end of the season, his reported wage demands (75k+) means he'll immediately be one of our higher earners - is he really of that quality? 

Lastly, there's the fact that he wants to play as a central striker. We can't pay him 75k a week and then experiment with him at central striker when he's never frequently played there, and doesn't fit the template of what Rodgers wants from a central striker.",0,1351558939,null,0,false,0,c6tmq19,t3_12auuk,t1_c6tmq19,t1_c6tmb9f,null,1430271813,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

The debt doesn't matter. The ""cost"" is the amount you repay, not the amount you owe. And for a HUGE number of graduates, they will probably never repay anything. You need a salary of &gt;£21k/yr before you start repaying anything at all. Even on the national average of £23k/yr, you'll pay a whopping £31/month which is less than an iphone contract. After 25 years, this equates to only £9k paid back before the loan expires.

You need to earn roughly £31k/yr in order to pay back the whole thing over 30 years. It's hardly a big deal. And if you're earning £31k, your degree was likely to be part of the reason why.

This system is actually better than the last system. You pay back less than under the previous system. It's also greatly preferable to the graduate tax, since once you've paid back the loan, you stop paying forever.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;And I'm sorry ... but I don't like a Doctor that hates so stupidly.

I don't think it's stupid hate. People will reference the Time War as the reason for the Doctor's hatred of the Daleks, but it goes back beyond that. Take a look at the Doctor's face when the Daleks attack in *Resurrection of the Daleks*, or the fact that he's prepared to kill Davros in that story. Consider his satisfied reaction when he thinks he's destroyed them in *The Evil of the Daleks*. Remember that he was about to kill off the last Dalek in existence in ""Dalek"". 

I like the idea that for all the Doctor's ideals, for all his idealistic passion, and for all he believes in and stands for, he draws the line at Daleks. They are his trigger. They are everything he abhors in the universe, the complete antithesis of everything he represents and sees. I didn't like ""Asylum of the Daleks"", but I can certainly understand his reluctance to have an unstable Dalek on board the TARDIS. 

For what it's worth, I also like the idea of the Daleks, the most evil, ruthless species in the galaxy, being willing to drop everything and shit bricks at the mention of the Doctor. He is their nemesis, the one consistent factor in all their failures and nightmares. Their hatred of *him* is *very* personal. 

Which, honestly, is why I didn't like their memory reboot. I still harbor hope that that is undone by a future episode. ",0,1351561118,null,0,false,0,c6tn8vt,t3_12akma,t1_c6tn8vt,t3_12akma,null,1430272060,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;Although the UK is a member of the EEA, a non-EEA family member of a British citizen should not generally come to the UK using an EEA family permit. However, a non-EEA family member of a British citizen living abroad can apply for an EEA family permit to join the British citizen on their return to the UK if:

&gt;the British citizen has been living in an EEA member state as a worker or self-employed person; and
&gt;the family member, if they are the British citizen's spouse or civil partner, has been living together with the British citizen in the EEA country.

Now.. here it stipulates you need to live in a different EEA state with your spouse (tick - you do) as a worker.. hrmm?

Well.. you are living there as a worker, but not working there as such. They don't define anywhere in the casework for the rules ([See here, Part 1, Sections 4 and 9](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/ecis/annexa.pdf?view=Binary)) where you must be working while you reside in the EEA state.

Seems to be very unclear. This is all under the assumption that Gibraltar is considered to be ""part of the UK state"" in terms of EEA states. Personally, I'd argue you were residing in Spain as a worker and so qualify. If they don't intend this possibility, then it should be written explicitly IMO.

Do you pay income tax in Spain? - Maybe you could use this to argue that you do qualify as an EEA worker?",0,1351564470,null,0,1351564697,0,c6to2a7,t3_12a28d,t1_c6to2a7,t3_12a28d,null,1430272453,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The only problems with that, that I can think of, are losing Suarez's fantastic distribution/link up skills and Suarez speed, he's great at accelerating but his straight line speed isn't the greatest.

The Guardian just wrote an article saying he is destined to remain a villain so I agree it will be difficult to keep him here.

Yes it would be interesting to see him play wide, most fans think he should but it isn't that simple. He seems so skillful and quick because of his manipulation of space in tight spaces, where he can turn rapidly, and central areas, where he can pick up positions where he is impossible to stop or mark. It is more difficult to do this on the wing where you must face a defender straight on and outpace them.

I think Rodgers really likes his forwards (rather than wingers) to play high up the pitch, similar to the jobs Pedro and Sanchez for Barca in order to stretch the defence, creating space for Messi Xavi Iniesta and options off the ball, not to mention counter attacking possibilities. Suarez could play that sort of role but would Borini have the technical ability to link play well enough? He certainly has the movement.

I think there is a case for playing Suarez in the position currently occupied by Sahin, but obviously further up the pitch. For those home games we have been habitually drawing I think it would help since we need more of a penalty box presence and it would create more space for Suarez to attack from deep. 

Although with what Rodgers tried against Everton in the second half I must admit I was purring with excitement because of the counter attacking opportunities it provides (Sterling's chance and Suarez isolating Distin on numerous occasions). It is something Napoli and Udinese have done extremely well recently (Michael Cox of Zonal Marking has [highlighted](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/10/29/everton-2-2-liverpool-surprising-levels-of-pressing-while-rodgers-switches-to-a-back-three/) it.

I wouldn't bring him back anytime soon because his finishing is still mediocre to below average even. He misses a lot of chances that a top flight striker needs to put away consistently. His touch is also pretty poor, the ball will usually get caught up in his feet. Everything else seems pretty fine for a striker, except...

His attitude. It's a massive problem for me. If he misses a clear chance, if a teammate plays him a poor pass or he doesn't read it properly, if he doesn't get a pass, if he doesn't get the call he's looking for, he'll immediately start to sulk. On the pitch, in front of everyone, to the point that he takes himself out of a live play sometimes. It's, to be completely frank, despicable. It's not the sort of reaction to have towards your teammates who are trying their best to help you score, or to the officials, or for the shirt you're wearing.

You have cards in your pocket to do that job. Especially since you're  refereeing children, you keep your language respectable. It's abhorrent that someone who actually had to gain their badges wouldn't know that. Maybe you should take a refresher.

&gt; You have no fucking idea about refereeing and the shit we have to put up with

Yes I do.

&gt; Im not afraid to tell people to ""screw off"" if they piss me off or to 'shut the hell up' Refereeing is a very tough job

Sounds like you're not well equipped to maintain your calm then, which would lead you to be a very poor ref. And it sounds like the job is too tough for you, if you're getting this mad about a post on the Internet.

&gt; This is just a fucking GAME

Right. So don't call children bastards.

&gt; Come to one of the games I ref and start talking shit, we'll see what happens.

[Oh tough guy over here](http://i.imgur.com/Kr48N.gif)

&gt; My job is to control the game in the way I see fit

Not really. You have a set of rules and guidelines, probably a code of conduct that you have to follow as well. Sounds to me like you break it quite often.

&gt; Do you referee then jackass? Or are you just a ""fan"" talking shit to everyone and when something doesn't go your way, whoever did that should be 'fired'?

No I don't referee. I actually play the game. Captain one side and play for another.

&gt; Yea I agree that its inappropriate but when you have to react that very second to the shit going on the field, you don't have time to think out everything you do.

If you can't keep your calm, you can't keep proper control of the game. I feel incredibly sorry for the children that are forced to play a game controlled by you.

Good read, I remember reading it when it came out, but I had kinda forgotten about it, so thanks. I just skimmed it, so I could have missed it, but that's the closest I could find to the quotes you mentioned. I think the sentiment is still the same though.

I think it could possibly work if we get a forward who could occupy Suarez's current role, to an extent, or if Borini is able to do the same, granted I don't know if his passing is up to the grade for that role. If he were play out wide, I could envision him playing an inside forward/drifting type role, with Johnson getting forward to provide width and link up with him. I think it would definitely be interesting to see if it could work, not saying it will, but it's something that I hope we would try out at least.

I can't see him dropping in a deeper role for us. Maybe when he's older, but his passing from deep would be a problem for me. He's great at link up play, but he's at his best when he's given lisence to roam/do want he wants. I think dropping him deeper would hinder him positionally and force him to defend and pass more.

I can't see us employing that tactic very much, although I must admit it got me excited because of te tactic itself and it showed Rodgers is able to adapt and change tactics/formations, which some thought might be a problem. If Pepe and Lucas were playing I don't think we would have used that tactic at all. Our 2 main problems IMO were distribution from the back, because of Everton's pressing, and Fellaini winning the long ball in the space between the back 4 and midfield. Of course Mirallas was a problem as well, but I think if we had Johnson back and Borini, for his defensive work, I think it would have negated their left side significantly.",0,1351569493,null,0,false,0,c6tp85v,t3_129ock,t1_c6tp85v,t1_c6tomiv,null,1430273007,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Though his family are apparently considering doing it pre-emptively

http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sir-jimmy-savile-family-consider-1372123

&gt; Relatives of Jimmy Savile are considering exhuming his body from the Yorkshire cemetery where the sex fiend was buried for fear that his grave could be attacked.
&gt;
&gt; The shamed TV star – swamped with allegations of rape and sexually abusing children – may be cremated or moved to a secret location if his family decide to take the drastic action.
&gt;
&gt; A source close to relatives last night told the Mirror they were thinking about moving his body from Woodlands Cemetery – after Savile’s gravestone was dug up yesterday to be smashed to pieces.
&gt;
&gt; His family said they wanted to ensure the “dignity and sanctity” of the cemetery in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, fearing that angry mobs could descend on the quiet memorial site.
&gt;
&gt; A family spokesman said: “Relatives are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery.
&gt;
&gt; “Out of respect to public opinion, to those who are buried there and to those who visit, we have decided to remove it.”
&gt;
&gt; Savile’s loved ones were not present when his £4,000 headstone was removed by workmen who will break up the granite and use it for landfill.
&gt;
&gt; The 6ft by 4ft wide memorial was inscribed with Savile’s now chilling epitaph: “It was good while it lasted.”
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday officials confirmed it was possible to move a grave in specific circumstances, with the approval of the family or a coroner.
&gt;
&gt; The process would require a licence to be granted by the Ministry of Justice and officials would be present on behalf of the Environmental Health department.
&gt;
&gt; However, one official revealed that moving Savile’s grave would be made more difficult because his coffin was encased in concrete – for fear of grave robbers attempting to steal from the late DJ.
&gt;
&gt; It is widely believed Savile, a renowned fan of expensive jewellery and ornaments, may have been buried wearing some of his trademark gold pieces.

England is such a weird place, really. It's bad enough that everyone ignored the fact he was blatantly not a good person to work around kids for so long, the fact that now he's dead everyone is rushing to remove him from history makes it worse. 

It's like France in WWII. Collaboration with the Germans was the norm during the occupation, once it ended there were wide scale [extra-judicial executions and public humiliation](http://avaxnews.com/sad/Collaborators.html) which enabled people to distance themselves from it by attacking someone else. Though the fact that picking on Jews during the occupation and picking on women who slept with Germans after it are both examples of socially acceptable viciousness towards people who couldn't defend themselves rather than moral behaviour seems to be lost on the self righteous mobs.",0,1351570682,null,0,1351571702,0,c6tph9e,t3_11tk2x,t1_c6tph9e,t1_c6pu9nf,null,1430273121,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

GCSE - General Certificate of Secondary Education
This is your basic high school equivalent. Everyone have to take these, and you have to take them for every subject. Taken at 16.

A-Level - GCE Advanced Level
This is taken at 18 and is your first chance at getting an idea at specialisation. After GCSEs you are able to pick certain subjects (normally around 4), and study these in depth, providing advanced education in these subjects. Unlike the US we don't piss around studying all subjects at every level to provide a pseudo ""well rounded"" education.

Degree Level
Hopefully this should be self explanatory, except that as mentioned above, we don't mess around with unrelated subjects such as making people taking Maths being forced to study a foreign language. If you haven't figured that out by 18, holding people back based upon unrelated subjects is not going to help at this point.

**EDIT:** as X-Neon points out, even at GCSE level there is some limited flexibility, there are core subjects such as Maths, English, Science, a foreign language, etc... Then you pick some subjects to round it up to 10 or so GCSE's such as CDT (workshop), art, music, religious education (which may or may not actually be a core subject depending on your school), and you get grades for each subject.

I'm just sad that, even with a heavily subsidised price, me and my brothers couldn't get the money to help her buy it. She's been paying rent on it for 32 years- if she coulda got a mortgage in 1980 she'd have paid it off several times over.

Sorry if this seems ranty, as I agree the diminished stock has caused problems- councils just used it as a way to raise cash without building new homes. Doesn't help either that In the mid 00's a shit lad of stock was sold to housing associations. It's just a personal bugbear as I've seen my mum do her best all these years whilst middle class friends whose parents could afford to get on the housing ladder patronised me about the only way she possibly could have.

I'm not quite sure how to break it down further. You have sex, for pleasure, like most of us do; if it's heterosexual, it incurs a risk of pregnancy. You might end up paying, in time or in money or probably both, for a child. (OP's "" ...they had sex with a women and now have to deal with the legal responsible for a child..."").

The motivation for this? Pleasure. Risk v reward. And *that* is what OP meant when they said in their tl;dr ""get his rocks off ...[so] donate"", which is obviously not supposed to be 100% literal. 

This guy? Got nothing out of the entire thing (OP's ""[i]t was just an altruistic act""). OP is drawing a parallel between this guy's case and the normal CSA case, which is often the want-sex-but-can't-deal-with-consequences. Adding the detail that he's gay just made the divide clearer, which is why they added it, so as to make 100% sure that we all believe that he did it without any ulterior motive like the more normal CSA cases.

You're correct, that was his role at Dortmund, with Kagawa as the most advanced midfielder. 

&gt; I just think it's more than worth a shot to switch Gerrard and Sahin's roles and see how the team fares, given Gerrard's natural instinct to attack.

That's actually how we set up in the Arsenal game - though, given that the game came straight after the Hearts Europa League game where we played a lot of our first team, and Sahin was still new to the team then, it's hard to judge how it went based on that.

I'd like to see it as well, although I'm less fussed about it now that Gerrard's settled in wonderfully in Rodgers' system after that awful early transition period - he's far more selective in playing the long raking passes now. It's hard because Gerrard is both our best deep-lying midfielder *and* our best attacking midfielder :P

I wonder whether Rodgers has decided that Sahin's defensive game isn't good enough for the deep-lying role here, particularly with Lucas injured and Allen as a makeshift DM. It was good enough for Dortmund, but then again the Premier League is more physical  /direct than most other European leagues, and at Dortmund he had the excellent Bender next to him; or maybe he's still working his way up to peak fitness, and he'll do better defensively then.",0,1351584698,null,0,false,0,c6trkmw,t3_129ryi,t1_c6trkmw,t1_c6trh10,null,1430274101,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Hypnosis isn't a ""power off"" button on his head like Derren wants us to believe. The guy would still be aware of what is going on around him, although he will accept Derren's suggestions to ""ignore it"", and *imagine* that this is his reality. 

The same process was behind a few of this other stunts, e.g. 
Hero at 10,000 feet  
The guy who woke up in Morocco  
The Zombie arcade shooter  
The woman who watched herself die in a car-crash (you really think that was a big sudden shock to her after she'd spent hours having a plaster mold made of her head? Oh no - she was *hypnotised* therefore completely oblivious to it all)

My point here isn't that its fake - just that its different to how it looks. When someone is highly suggestible, you could hypnotise them and put them in the middle of a shopping mall and suggest that the shoppers are actually zombies, and that this is the apocalypse - and get the same result.

true,Huggernaut,null,null,"At NUOIR, there have been a couple of interesting developments since last year.

The Liverpool team that came 2nd at Div 2 last year has been all but depleted and did not qualify for either division.


Leeds Met university, having been started 3 years ago has grown from strength to strength giving some top teams a run for their money. They managed to beat out Lancaster Fish to take the last spot to Div 2.


As usual, Halcyon took the top spot again, giving them the 2nd seed at nationals. However, they were rather unexpectedly given a run in the final by Leeds (who are a significantly different squad from last year) all the way to sudden death. The Halcyon squad has lost a couple of players but has picked up 2 new GB Juniors on the way.


Unfortunately, Leeds would tumble from there, first losing to Sheffield in the 2v3 and then eventually losing out 6-4 in the 3v4 vs the Pies team they beat 5-4 in pool play.


As far as Pies goes, this is the 2nd year in a row they've lost their pool and come through the backdoor, winning all crossovers on Sunday. Furthermore, the squad is a lot healthier this year, with hopefully a full team going to nationals.


Sheffield are also looking strong this year with a lot of depth and no obvious weak links, running Halcyon hard in the semi and losing by 2. Expect them to do good things if they can bring their full squad.


The final team to qualify is a very changed Bangor, losing 4 notable names last year but picking up 2 GB Juniors.

It is interesting physics, and it is very useful for carrying out tests pertaining to Nuclear Weapons since the Test Ban Treaties but it is not an energy programme.

We do have JET, which is being superseded by ITER (which we are also a member of), but we have no Stellarator (the best one is being built in Greifswald, Germany - the Germans also contribute to ITER). 

In our defence we do have interesting research into Spherical Tokamaks via MAST which could be useful - I think we should wait and see how Wendelstein 7-x turns out - if it looks like the Stellarator is actually the way to go and the Tokamak was just a historical accident then we should construct our own. 

Tbh though we could build our own, larger, ITER for the cost of the olympics so it's good to retain a sense of perspective.

I dislike comparing scientific projects to one another because the real problem is that the budget for science and technology R&amp;D is far far too small and so even demands which are modest compared with various political white elephants seem expensive.

ETA: why don't I just write a helpful guide? here you are:

* espresso, the basic coffee, a little shot. In Italy this is what you get when you ask for a coffee

* Americano- espresso with lots of hot water added to make it a tall drink, like coffee in America

* latte- espresso with lots of milk

* cappuccino- espresso with half milk, half foam

* mocha- espresso with chocolate

* macchiato- espresso with a tiny bit of milk added, it'll still look like a shot, just a slightly larger one

Also, you can't ask for different sizes here. The size of coffee you get is dictated by the type you order- an espresso is a shot, a latte is a bigger glass, a cappucino is a rounded cup. And they have rules about when you can drink what (social rules, no one gets shot over it. It's just like queueing is in the UK). Cappuccino is the morning drink, and should only be taken before 11. A latte should never be had after a meal- instead, most people will take an espresso afterwards to help burn through the food.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"Poll Tax was a system whereby citizens would pay a set fee for council services - police, ambulances, fire service, emptying of bins, road maintenance, schools, etc.  The idea being that you'd pay, say, £150 a year, for those services.

If you had a household containing one adult, that person would pay £150.  A household containing five adults would, collectively, pay £750.  It didn't matter how much you earned or what your house was worth, everyone was supposed to pay the same.

Problem was, it was tested first on the Scots, and despite promises that it would collect no more money than the previous system of rates, the Scots paid more.  And they hated it.  That's largely why the Tories have only one Scottish seat now.  In England there were serious disturbances, with police horse charges through London.  It was a disaster and spelled the end of Thatcher's premiership.  Michael Heseltine was the one who stuck the knife in, although by that time Thatcher had largely lost the plot.

So we settled on a different system, called Council Tax, and that's what we still have today.  Homeowners pay a tax based on the value of their property, or rather, what tax band their property fell into when it was valued many years ago.  So living alone, I pay about £800 a year (I get a 25% single occupancy discount).  The identical house up the street from me, in which five people live, pay only slightly more - despite using five times the council services I do.

You didn't answer which country you pay income tax to - if it is Spain, then you might be able to use this to argue that you are residing in Spain for work and force them to sort the Permit out quickly.

Another issue is that if, to apply for the EEA permit, they say you may not reside in Spain and work in Gibraltar  - then what visa/permit could your wife apply for to gain entry to the UK with you (without the intention to settle).. she would be left with a tourist visa as an option only - is this their intention?

1. get vast bastarding bit of pork (I used pork shoulder, as it's c.£3 per kilo; the butcher round the corner also does neck end for £3.50 per kg)
2. Marinade in coke overnight (I used Morrisons own-brand cola, which wasn't quite right, as it was barely even sweet - I hear proper coke (not diet) is the best option)
oh, I also put in a dash of Shaoxing rice wine (similar to cooking sherry), but I'm not sure how much difference that really made
3. Roast for 1 hour at 230C
with a bit of the marinade in the bottom of the roasting dish thing to keep it moist (I topped it up periodically)
4. Take it out, top up the marinade a bit again, and cover it with foil or a lid
put it back and roast for 2.5h at 165C
5. Take it out, remove the fat and shred it with a couple of forks
mix it up in a cooking pot with barbecue sauce (again, used Morrisons own, and it was pretty good, but whevs)
cook it in the sauce for a bit
and that's your pulled pork

true,Consider_Phlebas,null,null,"I've been alternating between green lentils and bacon, and chick pea rogan josh, both with rice. I make a big batch before my working week starts, and then just make rice in the morning quickly. (I have tried making rice in advance too, but I've heard there's a possibility of food poisoning from [reheating badly kept rice](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/can-reheating-rice-cause-food-poisoning.aspx?CategoryID=51&amp;SubCategoryID=215)


Briefly then:

Green lentils &amp; bacon

Cook up some green lentils (I tend to soak them in hot water and empty it out, just to wash the dust and such off them, then boil them until they fatten up and get soft enough to eat - I don't know how long, I just periodically taste them)

Chop up some Morrison's cooking bacon (74p a pack, perfectly good bacon, just not sliced neatly; you can snip off the fat, and watch out for the occasional bit of gristly stuff, but it's mostly good bacon), and fry it. Once the lentils are done, drain them and combine the bacon and lentils.

I've also tried frying onions and putting those in, but I don't know how to get my onions all sweet and nice like the sort you get on dodgy street food... I'm also considering chopping up some broccoli (raw or al dente) and mixing it in to make it a little healthier.


Chick pea rogan josh:

Chop up one large onion, and fry it gently in oil until it goes translucent. Then mix in a 1/4 jar of Rogan Josh paste (I use Patak's, and it's great). Maybe don't have your face too close to the pot at this point, as the cooking rogan josh paste can be a little sharp on the eyes. 

Cook that in for a minute or two, then throw in one can of chopped tomatoes and two (drained) cans of chick peas. Mix it up so it's all evenly distributed, and let it cook in for a while. I tend to find when you've just added it together it all looks like a load of separate things mixed up, whereas once it's cooked a bit it gets less liquidy and starts to look more like a proper curry.
If you've got some leftover chicken around the place, by all means cut it up and add it in (make sure you cook it properly, both for safety's sake, and because IMO there are few things as nice as when the chicken starts to get all tender and fall-aparty in the curry...)

Hope that gives you something to try out! Also, keep an eye on the reduced section in your local supermarket(s) - I occasionally will derail my food plan if something good comes up cheap (e.g. reduced sausages =&gt; bangers and mash and onion gravy for lunch!). If by any chance you find yourself around Canary Wharf, the Tesco next to the DLR station occasionally has brilliant reductions (saw a £10 pork joint going off that day reduced to £3.50; they regularly reduce their bread to 30p or thereabouts (especially on Monday - they'll just have a big trolley thing full of reduced bread).

I realise the secret's out now, so fingers crossed I won't have turned CW Tesco into a crowded Mecca for us tight bastards...

So, a 750MB allowance allows you to use the service you paid for, for one minute a day, per month (unless you want to top up some more). If you allow for the 2p/MB charge over 750MB to be drawn from the £10 top-up (I assume that's how it works), then your limit goes up to around 1.5 minutes a day.

A mobile network cell will typically be served by a leased line, ranging from 2mbit/s to 100mbit/s for cells soon to migrated to LTE. If you take an example of a typical 10mbit/s lease line, then it means it can serve three people demanding data at Ofcom's reported rate. If the usage of a cell is most during the 16 hours (960 minutes) a day when people are awake, then they can serve roughly a thousand people a day, if my calculation of one minute/day is correct.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not for privatisation. Far from it in fact; I'm from an NHS family, my father is a doctor and I've worked in hospitals myself. But that also means I've heard all the horror stories of NHS management incompetence (the public sector rarely attracts the best middle-managers). You get these failing hospitals which have had no end of resources and reorganisations thrown at them with no apparent effect.

There was a great series a while back by Gerry Robinson (worth digging out) on how a few subtle changes in management style could radically improve a trust, but the opposition he came up against (even as a renowned guru in the field) was immense. The NHS is such a colossal beast that introducing cultural reform at a low field is akin to banging your head against a brick wall.

Now I don’t have any insight into this particular case, but what I have heard (reforming procurement, rationalising cleaning to focus on key areas, pushing decision-making to lower levels) sounds encouraging. We’ve got a colossal looming generational problem on how to afford healthcare for the baby-boomers; we’re going to need all the help we can get.

So given that we're left with the not black and white world of looking at it more pragmatically and toting up the good and bad in people's business careers. In RB's case he's created businesses in many many industries specifically to disrupt them (e.g. atlantic, cola, money services). He's championed consumer service over the status quo, and done a lot of stunts and charitable work. He's probably bonked a few too many girls. Picking up on the relatively minor tax evasion he ran as a young man - that he settled and paid up what was owed - is a strange thing to pin on a gigantic career like his.

What annoys me is that the rejection reason didnt say because of Gibraltar.  It was a cut and paste job that just said that I didnt provide evidence of working in another EEA member state. Considering I put in pay slips, contract, letter from work, tax statement etc (from Gibraltar). I assume that they just simply disregarded it.  Would be nice if someone had phoned me and said ""Hey we dont accept Gibraltar, did you ever work in Spain?"" in which case, yes I did in 2008!

So as part of the appeal I did send some documents regarding my earlier employment in Spain.

The fact is, we shouldnt have to apply for a visa because EU law states that she doesnt need one, and that the residence card suffices. The EU is tackling the UK on this issue at the moment. But it will take time. Im hoping that the EU does win in forcing the UK to change its laws on that.

Its not so difficult though is it. A foreign national resident in another European country for family reasons travelling with the family member specified on the card for a visit..

I agree that him playing too deep would not be beneficial but I was thinking closer to being a 2nd striker rather than an attacking midfielder. Therefore giving him freedom and allowing us to field another striker.

Your right, we won't use it much but it was wonderful to see Rodgers adapt to the situation where some might have thought he would stick to slow build up play which would have hurt us in this game. I think we really do miss Lucas, Allen has performed admirably in that position but winning the ball and fighting for 50/50's isn't his forte.

true,cbfw86,uk,South West London,"I didn't say we had thousands of years of nuclear households, I said we had thousands of years of monogamous culture. Admitedly, in a moment of flippancy I became hyperbolic. However, nuclear families (or the decline thereof) is essentially a result of a move away from lifelong relationships to an ethos of temporary marriages. Most of my friends' parents are divorced and remarried, and plenty of them have step and half siblings. That's not a terrible thing at all, but it can--and does--mess some kids up for a good bit of time until they learn how to deal with it. And don't say it doesn't because it does. I've seen it. Kids fare better when they are raised by their parents in a nuclear environment. It provides stability, a strong sense of identity, and reassurance of acceptance. I know that's not politically correct, but that's my view. I've got an ex girlfriend who wants to have kids because she has a good relationship with her dad, but is scared of being a mother because she was abandoned. My own father has abandonment issues because his mother left him completely out of the blue when he was 12. My best friend at secondary school had a crappy relationship with both parents, refuses to go home for holidays, thought/thinks romance and love were pathetic constructs, and now at the age of 26 he can't make a relationship last past 4 months. A friend of a friend killed herself by jumping off a pedestrian bridge 4 months after t was revealed that her father was having an affair. This myth that kids are resilient enough to cope with anything is a lie. They can cope with most things, but identity and acceptance are paramount when a child is developing and when that identity and acceptance isn't provided in the home they suffer. Is that exactly the same as monogamy? Not entirely, but there is a growing mentality that marriage is not important (I believe it is), and the fruits of that mentality are confused kids left right and centre. Even if pre-industrial countries have more lineal households than nuclear (Bongaarts, 2001), that doesn't change the fact that divorce was rare and partners nearly always stayed with the other parent of their children. That's monogamy. Monogamy has been around for much longer than 100-200 years, and it is the shifting paradigm of marriage's place in society that is causing problems. The fact that nuclear households only account for 18% of all households in Britain is a result of, and not the same thing as, a general move away from monogamy to a new culture of poly-whatever.",0,1351608690,null,0,false,0,c6tuso3,t3_129xe6,t1_c6tuso3,t1_c6tudrz,null,1430275686,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Are you trying to tell me that sexual pleasure is the indicator of parental responsibility

NO! 

-if sexual pleasure was an indicator of parental responsibility then a whole lot of people could disavow any responsibility for their children. ( the majority of them probably women ;-/  )

What I think is important is that a lot of people are ""perceived"" as trying to game the system. It's viewed as people would do or say anything to get out of having to pay child support. 

This guy is an example

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1377008/Keith-MacDonald-fakes-death-Feckless-fathers-plan-escape-paying-child-support.html

Society and by extension the CSA has a pretty cynical view of people trying to claim they ""shouldn't be paying""

Had the guy been straight some people might have thought - "" well he fooled around - had sex and left a couple of possibly bisexual lesbains to hold the can - now he's saying he did it all purely for the couple - pull the other one"". Him being gay rules out any possibility of him ""having his fun and trying to duck the consequences"" - something which a large part of society abhors and thus help legitimise the CSA's actions. 

Gay or straight he did an altruistic act for which he shouldn't have got punished { he kinda got screwed over by the couple who could have ""forgotton/not known his real name"" when asked } however in a cynical world he might be viewed as a straight man gaming the system. Him being gay rules out the possibility of him being just another person who fucked around and then tried to lie their way out  parental responsibility.

To some degree. Just not on the wide scale that you talk off. I know for example they have a system like that in the Netherlands where non profit bodies manage a large number of social housing. As far as I know there is a waiting list but the rents are kept as low and as affordable as possible.

Sorry, but I have to call you out for being a bit of an arse here. Just because privatised healthcare is unlikely to work in the United Kingdom doesn't mean that it won't (and doesn't) elsewhere.

India, during it's brush with Fabian Socialism during the 1950-1970s, had a fully nationalised healthcare system that was *appallingly inefficient*. The President, Indira Ghandi of the Centre-Left Indian National Congress, was condemned at the time by the World Health Organisation for forbidding any private health providers to operate and forcing India's citizens to use the nationalised system.

In 1985, India fully privatised her health system and the Under 5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) halved, and the availability of 'complex' operations for people on a median income tripled. [Source](http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_statistics.html).

true,Dirk_McAwesome,uk,Norwich/Coventry,"""Everybody else does it"" is not a justification. Nor is ""It would be irresponsible of him to *not* evade taxes"" (which he does so personally, not just in businesses).

He doesn't enter old-fashioned, uncompetitive industries to ""disrupt"" them, he does so in order to take full advantage of the uncompetitiveness. His recent entry into the financial services industry is one of the worst examples of the way he works. He bought an asset from the taxpayer at well below its true value (the loss to taxpayers in potential gains from selling the government's stake in what was Northern Rock probably run into the billions) by using his public image and leverage over politicians, just like the preferential treatment (e.g., regaining the East Coast Mainline after a public sulk recently) and billions of pounds of subsidy Virgin Trains have received over the years.

His stunts are just a part of his egomania and I'm no prude about his personal life. That he eventually paid it back is immaterial: his business are built upon illegally acquired money and it wasn't just ""tax evasion"" but deliberate, naked fraud.

&gt; Only trains - for obvious reasons - are a monopoly.

Of those only trains are a strict monopoly but the other three are markets with huge technical or regulatory barriers to entry which would allow almost anybody to make profits - effectively legalised cartels.

&gt; I was thinking closer to being a 2nd striker

I think we're on the same page here or close to being. That's basically what I mean when I say ""inside forward"" or in a drifting type role. The only difference being tha he would stay a little wider and drift or cut inside, instead of being stationed inside or behind the striker in your 2nd striker idea. He would essentially do what does now, only he would be out wide and have a centre forward to play off of as well as an AM. The only problem with moving him in either position, inside forward or 2nd striker, is he would have to do more defensive work and tracking back.

Hmm, interesting, I didn't know that. I remember hearing about Martinez using 3 at the back with Wigan, when he was linked with the manager job, but I hadn't heard about Rodgers using that tactic.

Physics isn't a strong point with you is it?

The pressure is what is important, not the total weight. Pressure is defined as a force applied over an area. The larger the area for a given force, the lower the pressure.

The contact area of a tyre of a car on the road is a lot smaller than that of a lorry. The kerb weight of my Mondeo is 1600kg putting an average of 400kg load per tyre onto the road. With an unloaded artic weighing 14 tonnes, the average load per tyre is 0.875t. The contact area of a truck tyre on the road is more than twice that of my Mondeo. Therefore the PRESSURE being applied by the tyre to the road is lower on the artic than the car.

OK, want a real world test to demonstrate this you can do yourself? Got a wife/girlfriend or know any women you can talk to? Get her to stand on your foot wearing flat soled shoes. Now get her to stand on your foot with the heel of a pair of stilleto heeled shoes. Note how one doesn't hurt and the other may leave you needing a hospital visit. Same weight, vastly smaller surface area.

However: I think you've neglected to recognise the sweeping generalisation I was making in my statement.  

I was talking generically about the widely held theory - as held dear by Osborne and Co - that an unregulated market will work for the benefit of all mankind. This economic theory has never been proven in practice.  Hong Kong used to get cited as a good example until recently when it turned out that unfettered market economics had lead to - surprise surprise - one family controlling most of the market and absorbing most of the wealth.  This system doesn't work because (for no adequately explained reason and like every other system of ""governance"" that has a following) it refuses to recognise that people are generally self interested and greedy and if given the option to make a lot of money at everyone elses expense or help the world, most people take option 1.

First you imply the UK reddit is representative, then you say every politician was hated during Thatcher's leadership, then you conclude Blair was elected multiple times, with significant majorities, despite the fact people didn't like him at that point in time.

Aside from that, this arrangement doesn't really help the children more than getting the other woman to pay does. I mean, this random man who hardly knew the mother years ago and has never seen the children isn't their father. He's a stranger and forcing the two of them together for the sake of the kids would never work, after all, they're both gay for different sexes.

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;I was talking generically about the widely held theory - as held dear by Osborne and Co - that an unregulated market will work for the benefit of all mankind.

More often than not, though, government intervention in markets results in disaster. Look at Europe's spiralling unemployment, as well-intentioned environmental and labour legislation pushed employment and hence, economic growth, to more economically liberal regions like the Middle East and Asia. **I'm not saying that the legislation is wrong, mind,** just that such measures fall prey to the true 'free market' competition between governments to lower their taxes and promote their own people's economic growth.

You could then make the argument that fully nationalised economies and a world government which restricts 'capital flight' are the way to go, but consider the planned economies of the Soviet and Maoist regimes and the mass starvation that resulted from the nationalisation of the Russian and Chinese food supply chains. Say what you will about free markets, but the 'invisible hand' is (historically) far more effective at meeting societies demands and needs than governmental planning.

&gt;it refuses to recognise that people are generally self interested and greedy and if given the option to make a lot of money at everyone elses expense or help the world, most people take option 1.

This is a really great argument against government intervention in free markets, by the way. 

*If people are so terrible that they can't be trusted, and regulation is required, why on earth would we give people (in government) the power to dictate economic regulations? Surely they'll be bribed!*

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"I would probably sit him, if you want a defensive minded fullback who is safe with the ball, then I would choose Wisdom over Enrique. Enrique, while he can have moments of brilliance, is far too inconsistent for me. He has moments where he simply checks out defensively and when he's in possession he can be infuriating, with his stray passes or choosing to keep hold of the ball for too long. For me Wisdom is the better choice right now, even though he's young and inexperienced.

Also I thought the author was a little harsh about the Everton performance. I think the 2 main problems yesterday were Jones and the back 4's inability to keep possession, and Fellaini winning every long ball in between the back 4 and midfield. Everton pressed up higher up the pitch, disruption our possession, causing us to play more direct and exploiting their high defensive line. In the second half Rodgers made the change to play in a much more counter attacking and direct style, which I think the author overlooked. Going to 3 at the back also left either Skrtel or Agger free to challenge Fellaini in the air, while Coates or Skrtel/Agger were able to mark Jelavic. I was actually quite impressed, because one of the knocks on Rodgers, before coming here, was that he had no plan B.",0,1351617416,null,0,1351617635,0,c6tx398,t3_12ay3v,t1_c6tx398,t1_c6tsfzw,null,1430276777,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Didn't say either of those things. 

&gt; He doesn't enter old-fashioned, uncompetitive industries to ""disrupt"" them | effectively legalised cartels

Is far far from the truth - Virgin Atlantic was created to *break* a 'virtual' monopoly, and airlines are hugely competitive in 2012 such that they can barely make money. Mobile phones was done with no technical barriers overcome - he rented airwaves from others (to little success). Broadband was done by buying an existing terrible incumbent, and making it substantially better. I am a customer of that one I know. So interpreting that lot as entering cartel like markets to make an easy profit is delusion to satisfy your own views. Virgin Money actually started as a mortgage service many years a go (offerent pretty advanced offset mortgage products) and only became more serious after trying to get into high street banking (where new competition is needed). They got a good deal on Northern Rock because most of the other bidders fell through or were unable to offer any serious plans - 2 of the bidders went tits up during the process! It's a cut price deal because of the Northern Rock management fucking up - colouring that as a Virgin fast deal is a joke, revealing scant regard for the actual culprits in order to allow you to paint RB as some kind of criminal. 

&gt; sat on government contracts collecting the guaranteed profits

Virgin have demonstrably improved the great west route - again I am a big user of the route for 15 years and know it well, before and after. After that what government contracts are they sitting on? How much proportion of their $20 revenue does that provide? Are we at risk (again) of interpreting one relatively small aspect of the Virgin empire (perversely where they have popularly improved a previously bad service) and made it out to be some kind of evil plot!!? Why did Virgin get to run the trains until a new bid process is run? Because it would be fucking mental to restart it as a new organisation for 1 year only, and if you asked anyone getting off the trains they would tell you the same thing - they want it to stay Virgin cos they are happy with it!

But I am wasting my breath - you've turned legitimate complaints about the tax position of Virgin PLC to a full blown re-interpretation of history to satisfy you're own opinions. Such black and white thinking is plain wrong.

We also need to understand how it will impact our economy if we enact laws which make London less hospitable to the finance sector, and other nations don't do this. Like it or not, the finance sector in London does contribute a very large amount of tax revenue, and losing this would not be beneficial. So it would make more sense to push for changes on an EU wide scale, which would make it much harder for banks to relocate to France or Germany, as they would still need to comply with the same rules.

I'm always amused by people who complain that Derren is somehow being dishonest by lying about what he's doing and how he's doing it.  Virtually every magician does this.  

Let's examine a few common statements that magicians make:

""And now the card flies, invisibly, through the air and into the previously empty envelope""
Lie.  The card was slipped into the envelope a moment ago when the spectator wasn't looking.  The card isn't flying invisibly anywhere.

""Here's a completely empty bag""
Lie.  There's a hidden compartment in the side of the bag which contains something.

""And the back of the card has changed from blue to red!""
Lie.  The card has been switched, or was like that from the very beginning.  The back of it has not ""changed"", it's exactly the same.

You see?  Lying and misdirection are an essential part of magic.  Everything a magician does is a lie.  Derren Brown is no different in this regard.",0,1351620489,null,0,false,0,c6txy77,t3_12at66,t1_c6txy77,t1_c6tv4q8,null,1430277183,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't understand how an increased price for the same service will be better for all of us. If I wanted to tether (which i don't really) then it would probably be to watch youtube videos on my laptop while on long journeys. i don't think 1gb is enough for this, so this benefit adds little value to me. 

If the problem really was people tethering and taking the piss, will £2 extra stop them? why don't they just enforce the anti tethering policy in the first place? 

In my opinion it has been a classic bait and switch, and while i'm still fairly happy with the package, do have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, which admittedly is probably from my own naivety at not seeing this coming.

I highly doubt however that this has happened or will ever happen. I have never seen even the slightest bit of evidence that there is any conspiracy at all within football - only certain levels of incompetence at various levels (Sepp Blatter at FIFA would be my prime example of this).

What I have also seen is plenty of batshit-retarded conspiracy theories,(which make the 'birther' movement in the US look like credible scholars by comparison) Which posit that big teams (generally United and Barcelona) are the puppeteers in some mass conspiracy to control referees. 

These theories tend to point out that these teams win higher than average numbers of penalties and concede less. They go on to highlight various anecdotes of times when team x,y or z got awarded something controversial and then come swinging round to the absolutely ridiculous conclusion, based on nothing more than a couple of practically irrelevant scraps of non-evidence, that team x,y or z is the master behind some ridiculous conspiracy.

Also, what was the point of pushing the water jug to prove if Merlin has magic. He should already know. He doesn't even need to pretend he doesn't understand because Merlin showed magic the first time they met. So the water jug test would be stupid if they were the same person. 

Gaius should know every move merlin is doing. For ex, he should've known he was hiding mordred. Or how evil morganna is. 

There's many times gaius has been wrong about Merlin and had to apologize numerous times. 

Also, when Arthur saw old Merlin, Arthur kept saying that he seems familiar because it's something about his eyes. Well, if gaius is the same person as Merlin, you'd would constantly hear Arthur making comments about the familiarity of his eyes. 

Merlin is destined to be the greatest wizard to unite the land of albion with Arthur. Gaius is no where near the greatest wizard. 

There are plenty of things to show that gaius is definitely not Merlin. Also, there's no point in making them the same person. The father son relationship they have is so touching that it would be stupid to have them the same person. He constantly tells merlin ""youre the only important thing in my life."" Merlin would be so narcissistic to love Merlin the Way gaius does.

Anne Williams son Kevin died at Hillsborough, aged 15.

Recent events have reopened the inquiry into the deaths of the innocent 96 which should give the families of the victims closure.

Unfortunately Anne has very recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

&gt;Open letter to Sir Jimmy Saville:

&gt;Dear Jimmy,

&gt;I'm sure that in your way you are a fine human being. I'm sure that throughout the course of your life and career you've bought a lot of joy into peoples lives. I'd like to personally thank you for your contribution to broadcasting over the last few decades. You are after all the quintessential Top of the Pops presenter, and no child of my generation went without feeling a certain sence of awe while watching Jim'll fix it (however fleeting that sensation may have been).

&gt;My problem is this: you scare the living crap out of me.

&gt;You see, we live in the same city. As I go about my daily business it is with the constant fear that I may accidentally meet you. In the train station for example, or at a public function or charity drive. I realise that this is unlikely at best, however the odds simply aren't long enough for my comfort.

&gt;While I'm aware that this is an emotional and psychological problem I must learn to deal with, I feel that there are actions which could be taken to minimise stress and reduce unnecessary unpleasantness.

&gt;My hope in writing this letter is that we may be able to come to some sort of agreement (mediated by representatives) whereby we can arrange an itinerary to ensure that at any given time the two of us are as far apart as is possible whilst remaining practical. This arrangement would be beneficial to both of us as I really cannot make any accurate prediction of actions I may (instinctively) take were we to suddenly find ourselves face to face.

&gt;I respectfully request that you do not try to contact me directly. I look forward to receiving a letter from your solicitor in the near future. I trust that this matter can be dealt with as swiftly as possible.

&gt;Thank you for your time.

He writes of an incident at the Mecca Locarno ballroom in Leeds, where he worked as a DJ during the 1950s, when a female police officer came in with a photograph of “an attractive girl who had run away from a remand home”.

Savile writes: “‘Ah,’ says I all serious, ‘if she comes in I’ll bring her back tomorrow but I’ll keep her all night first as my reward’.” He then writes that the girl did go into the club and “agreed that I hand her over if she could stay at the dance, [and] come home with me”. He wrote that he did then hand her over to the “lady of the law…[who] was dissuaded from bringing charges against me by her colleagues, for it was well known that were I to go I would probably take half the station with me”.

* Stretched the shirt over any shirtsized solid object (a bin cover, for example, is what I used), and lean it against wall.

* Put a tiny bit of bleach in a cup and used a plain ol' paintbrush for the ""Bad Wolf"" part. Once it got white enough, I rinsed it in cool water for a minute.

* While the shirt is still wet from being rinsed, I put it back on the bin cover and used acrylic paint (mixed with water for a slightly better consistancy), for lack of fabric paint, and brushed on the Tardis windows. The reason for it being wet, I'm hoping, is to let the paint sink in better, so it doesn't remain as hard chunks of paint on the surface.

* I let it air dry, because the paint might smear in the wash otherwise, then washed it by itself, to keep the bleach from spreading. Can be washed with other clothes any time after that. Then I dried it normally in the dryer, and the paint remained intact perfectly fine.

true,strolls,null,null,"With Thatcher's council house sell-off she bought a lot of votes, and it was possibly even a major cause of the total change of direction our political narrative has taken in the last 2 or 3 decades (mentioned elsewhere in this thread).

But her claimed reason for selling off the council houses - and her prohibition on them being replaced - was that government has no place in property development.

I do kinda agree with her there - the purpose of government is to police and pursue justice when someone mugs you, it's to organise essential shared resources like the NHS and fire-brigade and to prohibit the local chemical plant from flushing its waste into the local river.

Had the government sold off council houses and mandated they were replaced then they would have ended up competing (to some extent) with Barratt's and Wimpey Homes. Your local council house-building department would have turned into a government run property developer, constantly building homes on a steady basis to replace those that were sold off, and I could well see this becoming soviet-style bureaucratic and inefficient.

I'm just not comfortable with the idea that local councils should be in the role of building housing that's destined for private ownership.

I don't quite know what you mean by people ""ideologically opposed to right to buy are people who never had to worry about never having had resources to pass on, who never faced the prospect of never being able to own property"".

The point is that you shouldn't *have* to worry about having resources to pass on or (to a lesser extent) owning property - back in the day you just put your name on the list for a council house, waited 2 or 3 years (unless you were in dire need, in which case you'd be expedited) and you'd get one. So why the worry, if everyone was entitled to a council house at a fair and rent controlled rate?

From a personal point of view, I don't think you should have to worry about having resources to pass on or owning property, full stop. If we divide the UK fairly we come up with about an acre each, and I don't see why some people should be forced to sleep on the street to ensure that the children of the rich can lead idle lives. Talking about ""working hard to accumulate a nest egg to pass on"" is just buying into the Tory narrative, which only truly benefits the rich. [Wealth distribution in this country is fucked up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom#Wealth) and talking about ""passing on a little nest egg"" is basically saying that the children of the rich should never have to work a day in their lives - inheritance allows them to become undeserved multimillionaires. 

Finally, councils *didn't* use the council house sell off to make a quick buck - someone else has explained that there were obliged not to replace the stock, but also prices were set by the national government and some of these properties were sold off for peanuts because you get a massive discount if you've lived there so long. I don't know your ma's circumstances, but she qualifies for the [maximum discount](https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home/discounts), and can buy her property for 60% or 70% off. I'd be surprised if she can't get a mortgage, assuming she's working; at least have a talk with an independent mortgage salesman (""financial advisor"" in the phonebook) because 25% equity is standard for buy-to-let mortgages, and your mum has 60% or 70%.",0,1351631962,null,0,1351654908,0,c6u17bh,t3_12an2z,t1_c6u17bh,t1_c6tr0fq,null,1430278701,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The reason I say he is dishonest is because when you see a real magician you know full well that it is an illusion. They go in to be amazed by a spectacle, to ponder how they did it. With Derren Brown, people actually believe he is controlling peoples mind, they believe that he is actually doing some psychological babble to make people do thing or to achieve something. This is not true, he is not doing this, what he is actually doing is nothing that you or I could do, apart from the fact he is a good showman.

Lying and misdirection are not the same thing. Misdirection the art of using the audiences focus to distract them from seeing the full trick and to get them to see what you want them to see. 

I would not count those examples as lies in the tradition sense because both parties know they are not true and the party telling the statement knows this and isn't actually trying to get the person to believe that statement they are telling. A ""real""/traditional magic trick could be done in silence without magician saying the ""lying"" statements and the impact of the trick would not be lost, the reason that magicians say them is to add glamour and pizzazz.

I'm not talking about incidents that the International Atomic Energy Agency rank as 'having caused in excess of $100million worth of damage or significant health issues', I'm talking about the endless small leaks and safety failures in an industry that is *supposed* to be flawless.


I grew up within 5 miles of a Magnox reactor, and we were regularly kept in at playtimes at school due to leaks at the plant.


But dont take my word for it  - read the data for yourself - 


http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/7073977/Nuclear-watchdog-reveals-harmful-safety-incidents.html#


*Operators of Britain's nuclear power stations reported 1,343 incidents to the Health and Safety Executive since 2001. The authority's inspectors classified 773 of them as posing no threat, while 563 were safety anomalies.
But seven incidents, five of which were related to power plants operated by British Energy, have been listed as harmful.*

This highlights one of the key problems with privatising essential public services, information asymmetry.  

Ordinary people without a good understanding of medicine are simply unable to make informed decisions about hospitals or medical care.  Already, you highlight a lack of understanding of statistics by picking a sample of 1 person.  Not everyone has the same medical experience or requirements.  Someone who suffered no complications would have no clue about treatment in the event of such an occurrence.  People with no medical knowledge or expertise are not equipped to judge something as complex as a modern hospital.

Well, let's look at this from another angle. Now I submitted one possible answer to your initial question ""They're Doctor Who fans, What do you expect?"" I presented an answer to justify the resentment felt by the person you responded to. The that you're actually responding to begin with means that you accept the idea that there are people who are fans of a tv show that are under influence of it or have to be under some sort of mindset to accept it. Thus any sort of argument you have against them could simply be labeled as ""They're fans of Doctor Who."" Thus anything you say is entirely irrelevant because on one hand you accept that they are different from your current way of thinking and then you attack them for being different from your way of thinking. Whether or not a TV show is inspiring is not for you to judge as there are a seemingly infinite ways the brain responds to external stimuli regardless if it is considered ""Second-rate"" or not. I, I enjoy the show personally. Is it inspiring? at times it does alleviate certain stresses of life and does inspire some emotional responses. Again my argument isn't that a show is inspiring or that all fans of all tv shows are not crazy but that you do not grasp the world in which you aspire to involve yourself in. If you did, you wouldn't have spoken up or constantly try to agitate me.",0,1351639556,null,0,1351642903,0,c6u3aw4,t3_12c4og,t1_c6u3aw4,t1_c6u30k1,null,1430279767,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Friendly advice, I know its exciting to be in a pub on game day but mind what you shout out, if you start mocking the other team regardless of how many reds their are about some other fans might kick off, so be vocal with restraint!

Also, some pubs (especially in London) are exclusively open to only certain fans so if you see a pub and all the guys outside are wearing Arsenal shirts or west ham shirts try to avoid it.

Words. In my mouth. Are being put. But keep going, you're doing well. I had no idea I was being hypocritical, using rhetoric or even that I hold the opinion you've stapled to me - no-one is more shocked than I, let me tell you, particularly as several times I've said something along the lines of ""I am not advocating a position either way"". It's sort of like I was suggesting a line of thought to see how people (the guy I replied to in the first place) responded to the position I raised. Is that so strange?

&gt; ""If he didn't want a baby he shouldn't have had sex""

Interesting choice of phrase. My personal take on the situation would be: ""I'm not sure if it matters that you didn't want a baby, because unfortunately it is here now - due in part to your actions - and needs to be taken care of.""

However a father being chased to support a baby is different to trying to prevent an abortion because of the simple fact that one is a unique entity while the other is subject (to an extent) to the mother's autonomy. I think I tried to make that clear elsewhere...

If you're going to reply, would you at least acknowledge that difference, even if you do then decide that I should pay £100 a month to a child in Mozambique to whom I have zero connection, let alone 50% of my genome.",0,1351642912,null,0,1351643559,0,c6u46g9,t3_129xe6,t1_c6u46g9,t1_c6tz0gl,null,1430280204,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To be honest, I'm not really making an argument in favour of privatisation. I'm saying that not all private involvement in healthcare is inherently bad. Your original comment says that any private involvement focuses on only making profit and that it's natural for standards to fall. I'm just pointing out instances where that isn't true.

Pharmacies are also mostly private. Boots and Lloyds are multi billion pound companies. Boots in now owned by Walgreens which is a massive US pharmacy chain. They get paid by the government to dispense drugs to NHS patients. Again, payments are fixed, but they make a lot of money per year.

As for why they don't want the Libor scandal investigated, I suspect that's not because they don't want to find out what happened, but more that they know exactly what happened because it does done with the full knowledge of the British government (and possibly at the behest of the British government). This is far more damaging to the country, enough to make it non-viable as a political attack against the Brown administration who were in office when the Diamond/Tucker conversations happened. 

But it's also possible that Mann and Leadsom were blocked (a claim that is made by Mann, not a fact - afaik) because it was felt that their ""outspokenness"" wouldn't be entirely constructive.

I couldn't agree more. Which adds further fuel to my notion that this is a long game exercise to leverage tax money from public hands into those of the private shareholder. 

I also agree that there is more than one model to choose, however, I remain strongly skeptical that any deviation from the current model will result in (i) efficiencies or (ii) better healthcare for the masses (better being a difficult word to define in this context, however broadly speaking I mean faster services, access to better technologies / newer innovations, cheaper practices, valuable options etc). 

Whilst the NHS many remain free at the point of need - the devil is in defining that need... is to provide health care for 'the poor'? is it to augment a private infrastructure? is it to only provide emergency treatment (which is then cost recovered later through insurance/invoicing etc). 

Many GPs may be privately run, however, this is (as I understand it) not the norm, and also only possible because they are a 'feeder' into the more general healthcare mechanism. Their costs are structured and mandated in agreements with PCT, and the 'end user' is generally unaware of these arrangements. 

My view is things is probably somewhat skewed by not being in the UK for the past few years, and living in New Zealand that has a hybred healthcare model that seems to be similar to that which the HCR will aim for, and in my personal experiances being generally quite unhappy and significantly out of pocket for healthcare provisions I would have had access to inside the NHS freely at the point of 'need' (although of course with some cost recovery from my taxes). I was in the UK very recently and had a very narrow experiance with the NHS, and it was worrying to me to see how far things have changed in just 2 years in terms of attitudes of staff, time taken taken to achieve things and generally the overall condition of the NHS building I was in. Its all a subjective and anacdotal experiance, however it felt to me like there was a decline in in the overall experiance as the patient, and I would place this decline firmly at the door of the 'changes' that have been pushed on the NHS in the past 10 years from political quaters.

In comparison, Jonjo is on 20k/week, Allen 45k/week, Borini 30k/week, Assaidi 20k/week and they're all ahead of the above players in the pecking order.

It also means that none of those players can justifiably be squad/bench players at the club - it just doesn't make financial sense - and that will end up playing a big factor in their futures at the club (as we've already seen with Carroll).

In general, try and keep yourself busy - maybe find a new hobby or pick up an old one, go out with friends, walk outside in nature (nature walks have been shown to be more effective at lifting moods than city walks) and try to avoid situations that might trigger you. Also take care of yourself and eat well - load up on vegetables and fruits, they're good for you for a reason.

If 10% ROI is expected, then 10% of the investment value must be taken from the funding pot. This means that any efficiency (bland generic term, but lets assume this means faster treatments, quicker patient turnaround, yadda yadda) gains can only be viable after the investment 'cost' (this 10%) is extracted from the system. 

How is this even remotely tenable as a finacial model? by keeping the costs in the public domain, all the funding (I presume from taxpayers, assets re-jiggling and IP management) stays in the system, in the private space, there is an explicit expectation that some percentage is creamed off before we've even started to see any 'better' use of tax / public money...

- Exercise regularly.

- Eat healthy. Eat more fruit and vegetables. Whole foods.

- Don't say negative things about yourself. Make a habit of not saying mean things about yourself. It doesn't help you at all. Realize that things happen in your life and it's not always your fault.

- Express yourself emotionally. Have a journal or some type of thing, where you can say whatever you want to say about things. Let out your feelings.

- Talk to people. Socialize.

- Have goals that you can achieve. Have something to look forward to, to make you feel productive.

- If you need motivation, then watch motivational videos or listen to audio. Some people like Tony Robbins. But it doesn't have to be him. 

- Donate to charity, so that you feel like you're contributing to society.

It's a big step asking for help, but trust me when I say it is the biggest step in most cases for most people. It's certainly not easy after seeking help, but it's a step in the right direction, a direction you now which to take.

I suggest you go to your GP and tell them you are suffering from depression, perhaps SAD-related. They will make you fill out a questionnaire and ask if you harm yourself or are suicidal etc. They have dealt with this many times before so there's no need to feel embarrassed or anxious about it. They will understand you want help.

They may give you medication and / or refer you to the local IAPT service. This is Improving Access to Psychological Therapies. In some cases, you can self-refer. You can find information on local IAPT services here: http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/services/services/

It is that imagination, coupled with the inevitability of the action and therefore the death (time displacement) that scares people.

In the past people created monsters which entered your dreams, it was a scary idea because eventually everyone needs to sleep, the angels work on the same concept, just a little shorter term.

I really hate the Rudy character and think the actor is of a limited range, but he did fairly well until we had to deal with his power and the weaknesses of that again (pun intended). 

The description of the powers for Rudy was rough and nonexistent for Seth and Curtis. The episode was written for fans who would understand a lot of orthogonal information. We start with a void of information (intro for new characters) and go to quiet obscure backstory fill-in. It's awkward. The rest of the episode is a constant need to spell/draw out situations. Rudy recap / potted plant tension for a simple gag / I'm a haughty woman / I tell involved stories with lots of detail but don't perceive them...painful is the word I label it. Simply allowing us to guess if they had been infected in the freezer without this green graphic is the smart choice, but they pander to the audience like that might be too much to hold in our little brains after blasting us with a number of possible backstory versions, minutes earlier.

I could barely stand to pay attention at the start of the episode. Again I had trouble getting through the Rudy tale. By the end I really couldn't care less about the tension (as Rudy implied, oh of course it was the storm, so completely unimportant that the audience might as well forget about it).

'NHS Inflation' has always run much higher then national inflation, requiring steady budget increases. The nations population is aging; we have a demographic bubble coming through with the baby boomers which is going to be very expensive to provide healthcare for.

The NHS is a funding black-hole; the more you do the more peoples expectations are raised as to what you can do for them. You can't win by pumping in money.

It's important to see the role that striker's play in the defensive system that we have. In many ways, Noel Hunt can be just as important as any of the back four on the defensive end. The way he in particular and the other forwards press from the front to prevent switches in play and forcing bad forward passes is critical to the success in the back. Once Pogs came in that was completely lost as he did absolutely nothing of any help. I think the Simon Church sub was a hopeful attempt to fill that void and prevent a ball over the top like the one that the final goal in regular time was scored on. Without that pressure up top we've seen how terrible our back line can be.

Any reptile shops near you?  They generally stock a very wide range of fluorescent bulbs with different properties which might do the job, and not too expensive either.  Poor lighting can be deadly to lizards.

Daylight bulbs aren't that great.  They hark back from the days when fluorescents were horrible flickery things you'd only put in a garage and you needed to do arty stuff under incandescent light.  You'd be better off with low energy bulbs marked up as 'cool white'.

Another trick I've found useful is to set a light in the bedroom on a timer to come on about half an hour before you want to wake up.

If you're in one room all day, then [get a few of these](http://www.tlc-direct.co.uk/Main_Index/Lighting_Menu_Index/Lighting_Fluorescent_Index/Linkable_Flourescent_Fitting/index.html).  Either hang them properly or just dot them around the place to bump up the lighting where you sit.  I bought too many of these when refitting my office but they're really cheap and handy.  If you use them without obstruction, they're as bright as any SAD light.

Check the wikipedia articles on SAD and Lux for more info.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"Using your analogy; a warm stove is only a benefit if you have a cold house. :P

Look at it like this; Doctor A has to process three lists of patients in a day, lets say 100 people. Due to ‘inefficiency’, (maybe the wrong appointment was sent out, maybe the patient notes weren’t available, maybe the porters weren’t available to bring the patient down from the ward, etc.), only 90% of those patients get seen.

So what happens to the other 10%? They don’t just go away (unless like in Theme Hospital they die waiting for an appointment), they have to be seen be *someone*. Magnify that up by the entire hospital, over the course of an entire year, and you’d need a bunch of extra doctors to cover off the numbers.

So you’ve got extra doctors? No problem, because any money spent on the public isn’t money ‘wasted’?

That money still has to come from somewhere. How about the science budget? Or the education budget? Or the legal aid budget?

Of course you could just cut investment programs or raise taxes, but remember the more money you pump into the NHS to cover inefficiency, the less money is going to get spent on the productive parts of your economy, causing GDP to drop, resulting in less money overall to spend on healthcare anyway.

It all comes back on you in the end.

I blogged on the site [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/developer-blog/2012/oct/18/responsive-design-guardian-introduction) about what we're doing, but essentially: this is a *responsive* site which isn't yet responsive up to desktop. If you look at it on a mobile phone it should look really good and load really fast (we've put a lot of effort into this). On desktop it doesn't look too pretty -- yet -- but we're working on this.

Contrary to your posts in this thread, I think detecting the user's device on the server side is really poor form. You're then tied to maintaining a list of supported devices which will always need to be adjusted as new ones appear. You're also then building multiple site per device, which doesn't scale at all. Responsively designed websites query the client to find out its capabilities (is it a large screen? is it on a fast network connection? does it have a low battery? does it support ""retina"" displays? is it a touchscreen? etc) without pissing about trying to infer all this from a few dozen characters of a useragent which may or may not even be accurate.

* To encourage enterprise and business growth and build on our innovation assets
* To maintain and improve the skills and employment prospects of residents
* To identify and prioritise the strategic infrastructure required for economic growth
* To secure greater investment from business and government in Hertfordshire by improved promotion
and advocacy activity

The second point is training - I suspect this will be wasted on teaching people PowerPoint

My girlfriend dragged me around there the other week looking for wooden laminate flooring, so I had a nose about, the stuff they sell nowadays is total crap.

I looked underneath one of the sofas, the frame was made of cheap wooden 30mm square baton - about £20 worth of wood -  with cheap lining, cheap foam and a badly stapled on material covering. They had the cheek to be asking nearly £1000 for this too. 



Also their laminate flooring is awful. There's no way I'd buy it from there, it just looks crap before you've even laid it. I bought engineered wood flooring in the end, more expensive but well worth the difference. You can see [it here,](http://i.imgur.com/233zJ.jpg) if you want.

Gray Market? I might be re-calling the term incorrectly, but I believe it refers to working in a legal[ish] manner, but being paid cash in hand. Failing that there are plenty of illegal jobs - as alluded to previously, think of illegal immigrants who disappear out of the system when they arrive.

&gt;If you're not a registered human, you can't enrol at a school because you don't exist and they get no funding for you. Can't get education, can't get job.

There's no legal requirement to attend a state school. If I have kids they're being home schooled. Theoretically the same could apply - you're right a person without a N.I number wouldn't be able to enter ""mainstream"" but they could be taught at home.

The cap itself is a solid color baseball cap we picked up at a craft store.

The lights are two white, and one blue LED wired in parallel to a CR2450 coin cell battery. All the wiring is inside the hat, and taped into the folded band that runs along the inside of the cap with gaffers tape.

The white LED's are insert through the vent holes on the side of the cap, and then wired in. The blue LED had wired attacked and pushed through a hole I made in the seam that ran down the front cent of the hat.

As I said they are wired in parallel to the CR2450, and tucked into the band around the cap. If you are like me, you'll add some extra wire, and a switch somewhere. Mine is under the eye stalk.

A battery like a CR2450 is nice because it doesn't push much current, so you don't need an resistor on the LEDs.

The eye stalk is a bit of cardboard tube, with red duct tape around it. It could as well been painted. A but of styrofoam, with electrical tape covering it is jammed inside to give the black interior, poke a hole through all that, and inser the blue LED from the back.

The ears are small (1 or 2oz) clear disposable cups we picked up from someone giving free samples at the grocery store. They are hot glued around the white LEDs.

One of these nights, [The Tuesday Club](http://www.tuesday-club.co.uk/), as a reputation for being the best mid-week club night outside of London. It runs other student bars and cafes, puts on shitloads of activities all year round... 

The city has the best selection of bars of any town once you factor in prices (ie, you could find better in some places, but they'd be so much more expensive you'd never go). From traditional pubs to quirky bars, hipster bars, sports bars, gay bars, small gig venues, mainstream clubs, rock bars, art-house cafes, folk clubs... It's all there in the city centre somewhere. 

I couldn't recommend it enough. It's also cheap to live and close to lots of other places- you could easily go out for nights in Manchester, Leeds and Nottingham, it's 2hours from London, etc.

Sussex is a campus uni so would be quiet unless you live in Brighton (which has very impressive nightlife for a small town), Exeter is a night place with a decent rock scene but maybe a bit quiet, Edinburgh is supposed to be amazing but I've never been, most students I know in Manchester live miles away from the centre because it is pricey so don't end up going out so much, some people love Leeds but I never really liked it... Hope that's of some help!

'Grow' as a transitive verb is perfectly standard English and has been for centuries. Using it in wider contexts as a synonym for 'expand' is perfectly cromulent, presenting no grammatical difference from the way it's normally used in gardening and farming contexts.

If you'd spent 2 minutes thinking about the English language as it actually is instead of rushing to judgement because something sounded unfamiliar you'd have realised that.

First, it's really cool to see someone with such healthy initiative and such a positive attitude, I hope your family member recovers soon.

There are plenty of places looking for volunteers all over town but these opportunities aren't very interesting to say the least.

The local newspaper is called the Maidenhead Advertiser. Naturally I expect they might be interested in someone with your expertise but getting work/ experience with them is really difficult. You could try contacting them and see what happens though.


I know about a few groups in some of the local schools that are part of a national competition called Young Enterprise. Basically they come up with an idea, raise money and manufacture it. The group with the best idea/ most profit wins. You might be able to help them raise money but this may be more effort than its worth. When working in schools you have to pass a number of tests to prove your not a criminal etc.

If I recall correctly there is a small bookshop and polish delicatessen on Queens Street but the large bookshop has closed down. There is a library though and loads of charity shops that sell tonnes of books.

If you like walking you're in the right place! Central maidenhead isn't exactly rural but A short drive will take you to some really beautiful fields and gardens. I would really recommend visiting Cliveden. I'm not sure if your familiar with the National Trust but basically they own and preserve old houses and gardens in the UK. Whenever you visit a NT property you're guaranteed beautiful walks. Also check out Windsor Great Park. Walking up to the copper horse really is enjoyable no matter what time of the year you go.

I'm sorry I couldn't help you more with finding something to do. If you have any questions about Maidenhead or anything else please ask me!

Edit: I forgot to mention the river. Walking along the river is really nice in the mornings.

Edit 2:  In the town centre, theres a thing called Art on the Street twice a year.

With a London based team the increased interest in the sport would likely mean a stepping up of the current amateur leagues and eventually there would be UK youngsters getting through to the NCAA colleges. But even if that doesn't happen it'd be an interesting thing to have.

It just occurred to me that you might not know: NFL teams don't run academies the way football/ other sports clubs do. Players come through their high school team, then play for a college, then if they make it this far go into the NFL draft where they are picked by NFL teams. The Lowest ranked team every year gets first pick and the superbowl winner gets last pick. This is why there is such an even league and why some teams go from years of being whipping boys to consecutive super bowl winners (see NE Patriots).

So strictly speaking the lack of 'homegrown' players wouldn't have any noticeable effect on the team's performance since no other teams have 'homegrown' players, but it would be a team of Americans/Canadians for a few decades at least.

Sean is not to blame for LFC employing (albeit unknowingly) a loose cannon , he is however, in part, responsible for exposing Chang for the bully he is before out of his 'trial period' with the club.  This can only be good as Id rather have him out now before he had chance to practice his method of 'communications' on somebody with a lot more clout and a higher profile than Sean.

You state above ""we needed to be avoiding controversy"" and that that process involves communications.  Surely Chang himself in his role as Director of Communications, should have known that and given it plenty of consideration before going on his madcap lone crusade to intimidate Sean.

He did not destabilise the club at all, that is simply supposition on your part.

Brown has published a number of articles and books, some for the general public and some for the magic community, where he goes into detail about how some of his tricks* work. It's fascinating.  
One example is an impressive ""mind reading"" on stage where he's actually doing two entirely different pieces at the same time - one for the young lady on the stage and one for the audience. Through the clever use of words and the careful pacing of the tricks he can make some pretty standard effects seem like a miracle.

As someone mentioned, Voodoo Rooms is small and classy.  Lots of style and the bar staff know what they're doing.  Not the cheapest though, but worth putting your head through the door for at least one drink.

The Water of Leith cafe and Porto &amp; Fi, both offer excellent food at reasonable prices.  You'll have to book as they are always packed out.  Not particularly glamerous, but warm, welcoming and very tasty.

The modern art galleries are always interesting, and free.  In fact, all the art galleries and museums in Edinburgh are free.

Although cold at this time of year, you will still be able to go down the Royal Botanic Gardens and feed the popular squirrels who will be stocking up for winter.  They have tropical greenhouses and beautiful grounds to stroll through.  On the way back, you can walk up Broughton street stopping at any one of the chic pubs and bars that line the street.

The Mosque kitchen is famous for it's high quality food, or if you prefer, Tangs Gohan serves some of the best sashimi and Japanese food in the city.  If Chinese is more your thing, head to Saigon Saigon (St Andrews square) where you can pick up some excellent Dim Sum (the place is usually packed with Chinese and there may be a wait at the weekend)

At the end of this month the Christmas German market and other attractions will be opening, so put them in your diary.  Edinburgh has a special atmosphere during the weeks running up to Christmas.

Lastly, you could take her for a stroll around Arthurs seat, or even the meadows (take a putting iron and a few balls and sink a few holes whilst you're at it).

If you have the inclination, the Sheeps Heid Inn (claims to be Edinburgh's oldest pub circa 1360) has good pub grub and some nice beers, with a relaxing, cosy atmosphere.  Perfect for a few jars and wasting away a Sunday afternoon.  They also have a skittles alley.  It's a little hard to get to though.

Angard are impossibly fucking incompetent, we had no idea when we were supposed to get paid, we were told to give our details again and then later found out Angard had lost them, some people got money when others didn't, it never came through when they said it would, and whenever the line manager would call Angard, they would just guess at when the money would come through. So every day morale was just rock bottom, nobody had any idea when we were getting paid. It was all over the news that other branches were doing walkouts, one place even held their line manager technically hostage, we were constantly on the verge of having a walkout but didn't want to leave our line manager with no staff because of the shit PR department. Some of the people I was working with needed the money for Christmas shopping, and had no idea what they were going to do for their kids without it - in the end it didn't come through until *after* Christmas. They paid us, then gave us a postal order for £300, and then told us they needed to take back some of the first lot, because they'd overpaid us. 

And this is the department set up to fucking pay the temporary Christmas staff. Country-wide failure, fucking appalling. Didn't give a shit for the welfare of the people who were helping with the extra workload. Earlier this year I was working in London and realized one day that Angard's offices were on the floor above me. Was so tempted to go up there. But a couple of weeks later I got a letter which apologized for the shitstorm of incompetency, and explained that Angard would be fucking off this year, and Royal Mail would be doing it directly. Also offered me early registration for the Christmas job by way of apology. Quite nice.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Why weaken our defense just so we can have two players do a job that one of them could do? Having Falcao + Torres as a strike force is  probably weaker than just having Falcao. Falcao is a line-leading striker. If we are going to go for a player like Falcao we need to move on from Torres. Ideally if we acquired Falcao then Torres would  be going the other way as part of deal.

The argument the article makes is that we need more depth in our strike force, but we don't want Torres to be unhappy, so we switch to a two striker system to accomodate Torres. This is counter-productive. Were in the process of building cohesion in the squad. Our defensive midfield needs  work. To change the structure of our attack which is making great strides AND to leave us with less cover in DM would be a bad idea.

If you are worried about strike force depth then we should sign a depth striker who can do a temp job but won't get in the way of Lukaku, Sturridge, or Torres.. If you are trying to find a way to bring in Falcao, maintain an awesome attack, and keep Fernando happy...Torres should go back to Atletico.
