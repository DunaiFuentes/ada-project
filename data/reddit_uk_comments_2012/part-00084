A Doctor Who Wiki implied that The Doctor was once a powerful Time Lord known as The Other, who along with Rasillion and Omega help grant Time Travel to the Time Lords. Thus He, (The Doctor) himself could be just a regeneration of this powerful Time Lord.

Next The 10th Doctor upon meeting River Song is told his name. He says there's only one reason why he would ever tell someone his name. The look on his face is not the face of one who just discovered they get married in the future. It is a look of fear/shock. However, now that I'm remembering this.

true,daveduckman,null,null,"read the statement. Obviously he's saying he wants to leave and that he doesn't agree with the management of the club etc. but he's not demanding to be transfer listed, he's just saying he won't renew his contract. It's not like Arsenal has a writ on his soul, it's not even like he's a local lad from the area, he's a player that has stayed wtih the club for 9 years and now he's said he's had enough. End of the season he'd be due a testimonial. Just because he's a really good player doesn't mean he shouldn't be allowed to move on from his club.

The point about loyalty bonuses are bollocks, RVP will be on the last year of his loyalty bonus and when he signs for a new club he'd get an IMMENSE pay rise and a signing on fee to boot that would far exceed any loyalty bonus he might get.

You mention Torres and how he left us, don't forget that when we signed him, Torres wanted to leave his hometown club that had built a team around him, brought in Aguero as the ultimate feeder for him, made him captain when he was barely 20.

I love Steven Gerrard as much as anyone, he's my favourite player and I always order my kits with his number, but if he had wanted to leave the club as opposed to renewing his contract a year or two ago, citing that he wanted a new challenge - I couldn't begrudge him the chance to fulfill his career. These are players who have already given so much to the club they've served, they've given the fans joy and they've worn the shirt with pride and affection, but that doesn't mean they should be in servitude to the club for eternity. Club's show absolutely no loyalty to players nowadays. If a player is getting on in age, if their form has dropped, if they feel a new signing could improve the club, they have no qualms about sending players off: it happened to Robbie Fowler, it happened to Jerzy Dudek, it happened to Sami Hyppia, it happened to Dirk Kuyt. When each of them left the club I was sad for a while and upset they'd left, but I don't begrudge the club renewing the squad nor do I feel that anyone of those players begrudges the club for sending them on their way - sure they might have wanted to stay, but they understand that football isn't just about club-player loyalty or player-club loyalty, it's about teams doing everything they can to win trophies. 

When Ian Rush left (albeit shortly) after doing everything he could for the club, people didn't forget his legacy, they remembered how much he gave to the club. Sure there are always a small set of fans who will think that players to be in lifelong servitude to the club until the club deigns to send them away when their usefullness is over. But I think the more mature fans realise that sure loyalty is important to a limit, but there is a limit. And once you've given 9 years to a club and decided that it's time not to renew your contract, when you're chasing trophies, a new challenge and a chance to make yourself the best possible you can be, when you put out a statement that clearly is grateful to both the club and fans for everything they've done, I think most of us accept that it's ok to thank the lad for the memories and wish him best on his new adventure. 

I wish RVP all the best.

OBVIOUSLY we need to build on our attack, but even if we made 20+ million on Andy, where do we go from there? We can't rely on only Suarez, and our academy products aren't good enough or experienced enough to fill the spot we need.

Hypothetically, we could have Suarez on the right and Downing on the left and a new striker in the middle. That leaves us in a bind if Suarez or the new player gets injured (Downing can be replaced with Bellamy in a pinch if necessary). Furthermore, even if we had the money, we aren't in a position to be commanding the attention of a Cavani, or an RVP. We could get lucky and make a big-money transfer for a player without Champions League, but if he bombs, we're worse off than we started.

Realistically, who would be a replacement for Andy? Liverpool is a big name and we might be able to offer big money, but very few (if any) established stars are going to move to a team without CL that finished mid-table last season. We're not going to get Benzema or Huntelaar. We're not going to get Mario Gomez or Falcao. We'd struggle to even get Luuk de Jong if his eyes were set somewhere else. Our options would be settle for unreliable players like Demba Ba, or buy young players and hope they pan out. Those options aren't necessarily bad, but having Andy on the books would do a lot more, and be less risky, than trying to rock the boat now.

I've always liked Andy Carroll. I liked him at Newcastle, I thought he was talented, and I think he has a future here. He's had a rough start, but I think the fans have warmed to him and I think he fits in with the squad.

I agree that if someone borrows what they know they won't be able to repay it is there fault and they should learn the consequences of there actions. The difficulty in have is with companies like Wonga who loan in the hope you will pay back late, part default or otherwise fail to pay.

No, shareholders MIGHT see their dividends lowered, but that is not the same as paying for something. At no point will the company turn to shareholders and ask for £150 million from them.

Indeed, you could argue that the government is financially better off in this situation as it gets £150 million in full, whereas if that money were retained by the bank, then on average, 60% of that would have gone in dividends, and UK Gov would have received just 82% of that smaller pot.

&gt;When the mob turns up at your door and says you owe them loads of money or the boys will come round and take your stuff and harm you, its called a protection racket;

Would this mob then provide rubbish collection, care for the elderly, fire brigades, police, road sweepers, and so on? The list is quite long.

&gt;you're peer pressured by social norms to pay up because ""everyone has to pay it"". 

Actually, you're *morally* expected to pay it. Everyone else is paying for these services in case *anyone* need them.

&gt;Seems like fucked logic to me and when i point this out then i always get told that ""it pays for all the services in your area""

You can always argue about how money is spent best. However, ignoring the services you don't need *right now* doesn't mean they're not there or not needed by anyone else.

&gt;yeah, like the cops that turn up to fuck you up when you dont pay.

That's a situation you'd bring on yourself, for deciding you had the option in the first place (when you didn't).

&gt;If tax is for my benefit then why isnt it optional?

Because tax is to pay for services for *everyone*, not just you.

&gt;Why cant i choose which departments get my money?

What do you think would happen if people had this option? For example, if everyone only paid for what they actually needed, we wouldn't have a fire service because after all, nobody ever expects their house to burn down.

EDIT: I should add that I used to think that taxes should be paid in one lump, rather than bits here, bits there, as the latter seems a bit dishonest in itself...but the problem then is that at least with the taxes spread out, you can see what's being charged for what (up to a point) and can the complain about, say, VAT being too high - if it's all one lump, people would complain about a single tax burden being so high, and demand that they be lowered without bothering to look at exactly what services would be cut to achieve this. You can already see this happening with the NHS - NI contributions are far, far lower than private healthcare, but while people are happy to complain about the NHS, they get even more upset when raising NI is mooted. It's the same with the BBC and Sky - in terms of value for money, Sky is horrific and the Beeb amazing; but again, people that are quite happy to pay £40 a month for Sky are outraged when it's suggested that another £1 a month on top of the £12.50 a month TV license would mean more BBC goodness on top of the channels, news, radio, iPlayer, Cbeebies and so on.

She grew up in what I think is now Lithuania, into what ended up being a pretty shitty life. She quickly learned that authority should be questioned after one of her teachers attempted to molest her in school, so she fought back. With nothing but a harsh and violent family behind her she left for America, like many jewish immigrants looking for somewhere safe from the pogroms.  
Arriving in America she found herself campaigning for workers rights in chicago when the authorities initiated a massacre through the use of agent provocateurs. From then on she considered herself an anarchist, the story doesn't stop there though so go check it out. She inspired the spanish anarchists of the 1930s to take power in government, this started the second republic which then ignited the civil war when General Franco allied with the monarchy and tried to destroy the elected government of Socialists and Anarchists.

It'd be really neat if the idea could be extended to cover smaller businesses as well so that *anyone* could advertise themselves on the back of a Boris-bike. Hell, you could even put QR codes on the adverts so that you could get information about a particular advert and a map to its location in the city. 

Events etc. could also have awareness spread via this scheme. 

Hell, with the right technology you could even hook up a lighting system to the display so that they function both as protection and advertising (especially useful in dark conditions). This could be powered by the motion of the cycle / pedal power.

You say that but they do that kind of stuff all the time. If, for example, someone reports a bomb they have to treat it as a bomb until they can prove it isn't. In this case someone reported a potential chemical weapon so they treat it as one until they prove it isn't.

The good - 

Concrete floors and walls tend to keep noise levels down.

They are relatively secure as it's hard to get away from the upper floors with large items.

The views are good.

The higher up you are, the more heat you steal from those underneath.


The bad -

If it's still a council block there might be a very high turnover of residents, particularly problematic residents.

Hard to escape from neighbours if you have to use the lift.

If it's not looked after, the communal areas can  deteriorate really quickly.

You want to do charity work? I would strongly advise doing something close to your heart. Most high streets have charity shops that often need volunteers.  Try and avoid the big ones like Shelter or BHF that have, in the past, employed 'questionable methods', if you dislike chugging and other dodgy means. 


* PDSA are great if you like animals.

* Cancer research UK

* Bernardo's

* St Mungo's

* British Red Cross

* Doctors without frontiers 

* Journalists without borders

* Marie Curie &amp;/or Macmillan Cancer 

* Toynbee Hall in London if you feel like working with young people.
  
* Crisis

The list can be huge. I would pick a sector you are really interested in, then google - find some of the smaller ones. I did Crisis at Christmas a few years ago and that was hell. Wouldn't do it again. I also did Toynbee and found them disorganised and difficult. I also didn't go back. Now about to start volunteering at a local PDSA shop on some sat afternoons.

It's great you want to get involved, good luck!

true,refcon,null,null,"Well let us start with why Quantitative Easing (QE) and bailouts were used. In 2007/2008 there was a financial crisis in the USA precipitated by the fall in price of US housing and the collapse of the mortgage backed securities market. This led to a collapse in confidence in the investment baking sector in the USA, as the banks had mis-priced (dramatically overpriced) the derivatives they were creating, selling and in some cases buying.

So if it is their fault why bail them out? This is the approach taken by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve in the US, when a private bid to save Lehman Brothers failed they allowed the bank to declare bankruptcy. However government and regulators dramatically failed to understand the consequences of their actions. The bankruptcy led to the freezing of Lehman assets and transactions - locking down hundreds of millions of $ and £. 

This meant people could not get their money, and when people cannot get their money from the banks they panic. The 1st head of MI5 stated that any country is 5 missed meals from anarchy. Had people panicked and withdrew their money it would have been anarchy - ATMs would have run dry, credit cards stopped working, people wouldn't have been paid or been able to buy food. 

In 2007 in the UK something like 80% of wage payment was run by the 5 large banks, they issued even more of the mortgages, of commercial lending. Even banks like Lloyds, Barclays and possibly HSBC who were substantially capitalised would have gone under had a bank run ensued. 

Credit is the lifeblood of a modern economy, it increases living standards and total output. It allows people to buy food a week before they re paid, allows people to drive cars insured and exporters to be assured payment. Had they banks failed this would have all gone. Quantitative easing was less needed, but it boosted liquidity. If you want I can go into it but it essentially did the same thing as the bailouts - support the banks to stop them failing. 

tl;dr if you use a debit/credit card, or have a mortgage, or took a loan to buy a car, or want to buy imported goods, or want to be able to access cash then it is a good thing the banks were bailed out.",0,1341491501,null,0,false,0,c59ox5g,t3_w2njd,t1_c59ox5g,t3_w2njd,null,1435703994,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Well it sort of comes down to the difference between what QE should do and what it's actually doing. In theory, QE should work like this: The bank of England magically creates money -&gt; It then uses this magically created money to buy assets off banks that are either illiquid (so hard to convert into real money) or otherwise not-so-great -&gt; The banks then have more ready cash -&gt; They then lend this ready cash to people in the real economy who go about starting new businesses or otherwise spending/investing it -&gt; This boosts the economy and we all live happily ever after.

From this point of view, QE is there to stimulate demand and in theory it's not a bad idea as the economy can't grow if there's no demand. That's the theory at least. What actually happened was this:

 The Bank of England magically creates money -&gt; It then uses this magically created money to buy assets off banks that are either illiquid (so hard to convert into real money) or otherwise not-so-great -&gt;The banks then sit on that money and shore up there balances whilst still paying silly bonuses.

So that's not really doing much to stimulate demand and from that point of view QE's been pretty rubbish. However, the positive side of QE is that by shoring up their balances, the banks might be able to weather the next crisis (and there will be a new one.... most likely Euro related). This is still a big 'might' and for Joe Average QE doesn't change much other than feeling pissed off that we're chucking more money at the people who caused the crisis in the first place. Having said that though, a lot of these banks are 'too big to fail' and the consequence of one or two falling over are pretty apocalyptic. The same goes for bailouts: If we had allowed some of our banks to collapse it would have had a catestrophic affect on the nation as a whole and the clusterfuck of 2008 would have seemed like a picnic.

From my own understanding *some* historians think it would have lead to civil war but there are multiple schools of thought on what *might* have happened. 

Some of them do indeed think a civil war between Catholics and Protestants (which we had anyway - just that it might have kicked off sooner if Fawkes had succeeded) and that the Kingdom would have been united as a Protestant nation with a rebellion from the Irish (which we had anyway) and less grief off the Scottish.

Some think it would have lead to a civil war during which the French would have taken advantage and invaded us wholesale, and that we would probably still be part of France now.

As the same plot wouldn't be motivated by Catholic vs Protestant violence (just the Irish and the Scots that still struggle over that one these days) in this day and age then I'm not sure what you think the sides in a civil war would be if such a think was carried out today?

In threads where people discuss 10th's companions one of the common reasons people site is that she had no romantic intentions. Along with that came an air of gratefulness to the Doctor that some could perceive as bordering on ingratiation. Something that I imagine can be frustrating to watch for some.

After several seasons and a pair of companions it is understandable that a rabid fanbase would enjoy a relief from such a focus. Beyond the character Donna Noble comes to represent anti-companion based on the tone set by the first three series. Donna was often loud, brashly argumentative, blithely opinionated, and at times willfully ignorant. Through her tenure as companion many of these traits recessed to a significant degree, but were always integral in placing her in stark contrast to Rose and Martha.

As to why stating ones dislike for Donna evokes such anger and downvotery from Redditors... I'm not sure.

At least we all love Rory.

Offsetting that wage deflation is almost full employment and a relatively high standard of living. Have you ever been to Germany? The Germans drive nice cars, eat in nice restaurants, have a decent social net and an effective subsidised health service.

Because it leads to increased employment? Because they take a mature approach to employment relations?

I don't see the problem here. 

As part of the exhibition - in trying to say something interesting about the causeway and the part it has played in history - it mentions that creationists viewed the causeway in a particular way, and believe it would be x years old. 

the alternative of course it to not acknowledge that people have different views, sometime religious, and that they continue to do so. that sounds dangerous to me, and as long as this is not being presented as fact (which it was clearly not), what's the problem?

alternatively I suppose the exhibition could say ""some creationists believe x about the causeway - can you believe how retarded some people are! fucking idiots! hahaha!""

true,setaceus,null,null,"Bradford born and raised, went to the university, and I now live in the US (Atlanta).

&gt; housing

If you're only going to be there for a year, the halls of residence are okay - I stayed in halls for a year and it was fine. There's plenty of private landlords happy to let to students very near to campus.

&gt; transportation

Like any city in the UK we have buses for travel within the area, and trains for traveling to other cities. They don't come on time, but they're good enough to get around. And of course unlike most of the US, it's fairly easy to walk to somewhere you need to go and our cross-walks are much easier to cross (at least from my experience in Atlanta).

&gt; food shopping

Unfortunately you have a bit of a walk from the main campus to the nearest decent-sized supermarket. But there are plenty of corner shops, and there are a couple of large Asian grocery stores much closer (when somebody says Asian in Bradford, it means from South Central Asia, not from East Asia). I usually managed to walk all the way there and carry the shopping all the way back, but there are taxis. And if you're not living on campus, you can probably get Tesco home delivery.

&gt; Also wondering what the weather is like, since I'm sure it is much different than California weather.

Cold. Rainy. Windy. Welcome to the UK!

I visited northern California for a fortnight (that's 2 weeks - remember that) many years ago, and the sun shone the whole time and it was really really hot. If the sun shines for 2 days in a row and the temperature's 18C in Bradford you're having a heatwave.

&gt; What could I do to be a good visitor to the area and also have a good time during my time there?

I would suggest you join some of the student union clubs. For most of them it's a flat fee for the whole year. I think you pay £1 to join the student union for a year then £2 on top of that per society and most societies don't have any kind of per-session fees. Very cheap compared to other universities. Sports cost a little more, but you pay a one-off fee of about £60 (for insurance or something) and you can do as many sports as you like (some do have per-session fees, but most don't).

Bradford is famous for its curries. Eat some.

The National Media Museum (previously known as the National Museum of Photography Film and Television) is brilliant, and they have one of the best cinemas in the country (The Pictureville) in terms of showing a lot of films that have very limited releases, and they have one or two film festivals held there.

If you like literature there's some Bronte sisters-related stuff in Haworth (and I believe an old-fashioned railway).

If you like history and old buildings, there are castles and stately homes nearby that you can visit. York is only an hour on the train away, very touristy and historic city with some Tudor buildings and a mostly-intact city wall.

Many Muslim-run businesses won't accept credit or debit cards so carry cash - something about not borrowing money in Islam.

Yes, I've been to Germany.  Multiple times.  The last time a few months ago, when my girlfriend was working out there.  Not that this has anything whatsoever with the validity of my argument.

You completely ignored the point that quality of manufacture is just one aspect that a buyer examines when choosing a product.  If it wasn't, Germans wouldn't need to depress their wages to achieve full employment as they would have it for ""free"", merely by producing goods that are better in quality than anybody else.

&gt; Because it leads to increased employment?

Yes, and why does it do that?  I thought according to you people were eager just to buy high quality goods at any price, and wouldn't be swayed by lower quality goods made in e.g. China being sold at a lower price.

I can't blame them because coming out and saying he's not going to stay tells everyone that he doesn't want to be there and since Arsenal have one year left with him they'll be forced to sell him now if they want to get anything out of him.

Its very similiar to Torres, and I hope fans in this sub who think Arsenal fans are being unreasonable will remember the outcry and anger when Torres left.

There was no intent to use the fallout for anything useful. Consider how useful mines are in combat, a dirty-bomb would provide the same ability without the need to have engineers spend days laying the field. If it worked they'd have thousands of them in their arsenal today. Instant area-denial at the push of a button, very very useful for defensive purposes.

With long term stock holding, which is the other side of the coin you are trying to conflate gambling with, the companies involved get capital to help them expand, employ, create wealth. Gambling on stock does nothing like that, it merely creates massive volatility in the markets, and bubbles in prices.

Some transactions are zero-sum, they add nothing to the economy. The real economy could be defined as those transactions that are not zero-sum.

Are you thinking that a little more regulation or taxes would fix the scale of the problem? A little more capitalism or a little more state here and there to remedy the mess?

Or are you expecting the financial elite to become modest folk who would avoid easy money?

Dream on.

The current cabal are far too far down the road for that.

The network will eventually crash again and next time the state willing or not will be incapable of bailing them out.

At which point there is an unguarded crash after which finance will rebuild as the cautious and austere sector it can be. Until the day of plenty returns again and the cycle goes on.

&gt;""I am a keen naturalist, so I have every sympathy for open-minded scientific enquiry. But as I say, I am deeply concerned that Mr. Hutton may mislead you with his theories on the age of the Earth,"" the rector is heard to say.

&gt;""We know from the Bible that the Earth is 6,000 years old - one has merely to count the generations between Adam and the birth of Our Lord.

&gt;""And for all his eminence as a geologist, and his standing with the Royal Society in Edinburgh, that makes Mr. Hutton's theory nonsense!""


&gt;Mr Hutton responds: ""Now, now, Dr. Richardson - I am well aware that my theory is challenging, upsetting to many. I myself find it dizzying.

&gt;""Yet when I look at the evidence, at the slow and steady volcanic formation of rocks - occurring even as we speak - I am driven to believe that 6,000 years is a mere blink in the life of the Earth.

I'm in the middle of series three.  I know about the comment by the face of Bo, but to my knowledge (until I read your post), the Doctor was the only remaining Time Lord.  The first sentence of your post was ambiguous; I took it to mean how does he feel about the actions of his former fellow Time Lord peeps - the war and all that.  It was by no means obvious that you were going to be revealing plot points from episodes I've not seen yet.  (I'm trying to phrase this ambiguously so as not to spoil anything for anyone who's seen fewer episodes than I have.)

When I learned about this subreddit, I thought about whether I should join.  Since I haven't finished the series, I didn't want anything to be spoiled for me.  What made me decide to join, and feel safe in reading the posts, is the fact that there's a very clear spoiler policy spelled out at the top of the right-hand column.  It says posts with spoilers will be deleted.  I relied on that.  But now, twice in one week, I've come across posts with spoilers (the first one had a spoiler in the title).  

There are people in this subreddit who have not finished watching the series.  Please keep this in mind.  It would have been very simple for you to put a spoiler warning in the title of your post, or in the first line of text.  Because you didn't, I was tipped off to what appears to be a pretty major development in the plot.  I'm disappointed, because one thing I love about this series is the sense of surprise and pleasure as I watch the plot unfold.  Some of that will be lost to me now.

The second is the fact that many users cannot get the amount they need and mix in other substances often with no idea WTF it is and this “poly drug” use can kill.

If you were printing an image with a lot of bright green and orange- which would display perfectly well on an RGB display- you might have some problems. 

Green, as everyone knows, is a combination of blue and yellow pigment. In the CMYK set this is basically a combination of cyan and yellow dots, however the yellow in the process set is a red-shade yellow and on the colour spectrum is more towards orange than green meaning that the resultant green is *dirtier* than if a green pigment had been used. Similarly with orange being red and yellow, that's made by printing yellow and magenta dots. Magenta is a blue-shade red more towards purple than orange on the spectrum and results in *dirty* oranges. [Hexachrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachrome) was specifically introduced to try to address this particular issue and is basically the CMYK set with Orange and Green inks added making a six-colour process set.

I have found a few gems that have raised some money and quality unwanted books come home with me rather than get pulped. I work in a local community centre teaching IT skill and computer maintenance, it has allowed people to get jobs and enabled people who are unsure of the benefits of computers learn in a none pressured environment, having people come back just to say thanks as they now chat to friends and relatives every day makes it worthwhile. I also do literacy and numeracy clubs that have helped people to overcome problems and write good CVs. Over the summer I run a reading group for local teenagers, this started as they were just hanging around outside my home and annoying the hell out of me. Rather than call the police I got talking to them, they had nothing else to do so once a week we sit and read a book. A young man that was functionally illiterate two years ago now borrows my Voltaire, I’m only just keeping up with him. I also help with people that face financial hardship, with the way the world is this is great way to help others, the DWP makes errors all the time, bill are going up and the funds that organisations like British gas have to help those in poverty are not well known and difficult to access. I know that just be being a person that can find the CEO’s email address and argue with people has meant that people have had the lights stay on, and most of the people I help are in work or desperately want to be if anyone is thinking scroungers.  I also tutor local kids, I live in an area of limited opportunities and the little extra support I give helps overcome the inequalities in education. 
However the thing that I do that I feel helps others the most is I bug the hell out of my MP. I write to him most weeks with well-constructed questions and examples of how people that he is supposed to represent are failed by him and his parties’ policies. I also invite him to attend things like the reading club the fact he has to reply at least keeps him away from doing more harm. 
So in answer to your post, how can you start being part of the solution? Get up and do something, the jobcentre website where you can look for work also has a section where you can search for local opportunities. Volunteer England is a good website that  will also highlight opportunities. But look to you skills and interests and find an organisation that is a good fit. Given the idiotic way our country is heading opportunities for volunteering are abundant but if you want to make a real difference then you have to become political. 
In a full time role you should still be able to find a few hours a week to work in a charity shop or a local project. And if you cannot find one that fits you, please consider starting one.

1) When Vincent gets to see his art work in the gallery and hears Bill Nighy tell what an amazing impact his art has on the world, I just fall a part at the seams.  As a visual artist myself, I constantly question if my art even matters or if it's even worth making since no one will probably even want it after I'm gone.  I want to make an impact but I probably will never know if I ever will. To see Vincent get that confirmation is just beautiful.

2) The very end when they see that despite EVERYTHING Vincent still commited suicide and the Doctor gives that lovely speech: ""The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.  The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice-versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.""  I have struggled with depression for over 13 years (half of my life actually) and this quote (for whatever reason) is something that stuck with me and helps me through those really hard and dark times.

And you should be aware that because series 1-6 (and the classic series and expanded universe material) are past the spoiler policy date, everything is up for dibs. You should expect for there to be spoilers. The subreddits have to keep a balance between spoiler policy and hampering conversation by tagging everything and 48 hours is where the line has been drawn.

That and the players we now have the potential to lure to the club because of him like Moutinhio, Hulk and Falcao... 

Another reason to add in is that Levy didn't really trust Redknapp with any transfer targets and by no surprise after his spending habits at previous clubs, it's a pleasant surprise which has suddenly came as a result of AvB's appointment.

true,hlabarka,null,null,"I'm not an expert on Swedish social policy, but I think it goes both ways. On one hand, the system relies on people not abusing it. Presumably Swedes learn a sense of responsibility and fairness from a good Swedish education. Many immigrants may not see the world in the same way and also may not feel that they are part of Swedish society. On the other hand, the system also relies on people being willing to care for the welfare of all the other people.

Heres why. 
Rodgers agreed a price and wages while at Swansea for a good player for them, that took into account market value.
He didnt become a better player when Rodgers moved to Liverpool, so why should we pay more wages or a higher fee? We're not getting more for our money than Swansea, and we're actually offering a better deal in the fact that Liverpool are a greater club than Swansea.

Rodgers did exactly the right thing. He wasnt going to be made to look a fool like Daglish was with extortionate fee's. He simply said NO, i refuse to make the deal, because he knows theres other players out there.

I myself of course am an immigrant - I left the UK feeling a bit of a stranger in my own country whilst living near Heathrow in the reception areas, but I have learnt to speak the language fluently within the first year, I made sure I had a job before I came. I pay very high taxes, I adopt the culture as best I can, and contribute much more than I take out, which is okay by me. I have children here so I hope I am building a better future for them. Many of the earlier immigrants here are highly educated (especially ones from the middle east) they sometimes have problems getting jobs matching their academic qualifications. Recent influxes have been from Somalia and Iraq, and they are pretty much just a massive drain on society, they have huge familes they can't support, and are pretty much a lost generation, that the politically correct society of Sweden dare not even take up as being a problem. More details here if you can read Swedish http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.115816-28-10-07-goteborgs-somalier-ett-folk-i-kris 

(Göteborgs somalians a people in crisis).

The Swedish people have an amazing tolerence and have invested alot of time and effort attempting to integrate the immigrants with varying levels of success. I guess only time will tell if it has succeeded or not. It's a hell of alot for one country to adsorb in one go. One Swedish city alone (Södertälje) has taken in many many more Iraqi refugees than the US and Canada Combined!, and we are only 9 million people.

* Is it possible the longer he remains in a particular regeneration, the amount of 'regeneration energy' to be released increases?  He was the 10th WAY longer than the 9th.  Or maybe all his dickering around when he channeled energy into the hand screwed things up?

* For the 10th, the 'injury' he sustained was fairly passive and he allowed the regeneration to occur within like a minute of his ""death"" (referring to the moment lethal damage was dealt).  The process seemed like a very natural venting of the energy.

* For the 11th, the 'injury' was a lot more traumatic, on top of that he held it off for probably at least an hour(?) while he made his goodbyes.  The whole time the energy was building up to the point where it literally exploded out of him.

Why Alan Johnson? He seems so nice that you would feel guilty to even disagree with him. Plus he was not a massive player in the previous governments. Also, Johnson is able to distinguish himself from John Lydon - because well, the Conservative Press/Commentators like to think anyone on the Labour front bench (except Tony Blair) is secretly the successor to Lenin, Trotsky or Stalin.

What he is saying is that effects aren't always caused by something. Sometimes things are backwards, with effects happening before their cause, or even causing their cause to cause them. 

If time travel were possible in reality these things would usually result in big complex paradoxes with impossible repercussions, but when the Doctor is involved things always just seem to work out. In this case they work out just right to create a stable time loop, which is what the situation I described would be.

Why dig up buried hatchets or rip open old wounds?  Especially when we know what is buried. We know exactly who should have been blamed along with the army in the Saville Inquiry.  Even reading the Saville Inquiry it is clear a deal was struck.

          'at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or 
          Command of the Provisional IRA had engaged in 
          paramilitary activity during the day'.

There just so happens to be evidence that he was armed on the day and in the Bogside area, and that one of the youths shot just happened to have nail bombs in his pockets, and when the crowd began throwing stones and the army did open fire the first person they shot just so happened to have been a confirmed, armed IRA member and combatant.  That the adjutant for the IRA just happened to be moving arms on that day, during that protest when the army was present, and that he was doing it lone wolf?  That the overall number#2 for the whole IRA was operating without his sergeants and protection.   Instead we're asked to accept that it was all coincidence and an IRA commander on the streets, and other armed IRA combatants being shot along with innocents, had no part in the day's events and aren't connected.  That they turned up with nail bombs in their pockets but with no intention to use them.

Even Sinn Fein has said that if an investigation wants Martin McGuinness to talk freely about Bloody Sunday 
he needs immunity from prosecution.  Let alone the Thompson machine gun he was suspected of carrying was also used to kill two policemen days earlier.

Everybody knows what the Saville Inquiry knew.

The Commander of the Provisional IRA was up to his neck in militant operations on Bloody Sunday, armed and on maneouvers,  but the investigation couldn't swing him from the lamppost because by the time of the investigation the same commander, Martin McGuinness, was now a key figure in the peace process.

In the words of the Prime Minister:  
  
             ""I do find it painful that I now sometimes sit around a table with Martin McGuinness 
              and I think about what that man did, but everyone has to come to terms with that 
              because that is the price we are paying for peace, and it is a price that is worth 
              paying because peace is so much better than the alternative.”

He's just got to the stage of meeting the Queen and all the soldiers involved are either already, or not too far off becoming, pensioners.  It was 40 years ago.  Let some things lie down and die.  If the informant 'Infliction' is correct, when both the security services and Lord Saville have already stated him to be reliable, and if he'd been allowed to testify, there's a very real chance Martin McGuinness could tip the Sinn Fein leadership today for what he did 40 years ago.

Infliction's statement suggests that after McGuinness had put IRA youth fighters in the vicinity he retired to the overlooking block of Rossville flats and, using a cop killing Thompson machine gun, opened fire on the crowd and soldiers to instigate an insurrection.

Adding Gylfi as a possible midfielder, at least in AVB's 4-3-3 and you've got 6 players fighting for 2-3 spots, with another 2 possible coming in. What worries me most is Livermore won't be getting as much play time as he did this season. It so clear how much his game has improved when at the beginning of the season I barely knew his name, but towards the end I was excited if I saw him starting, even over the likes of Modric. If we can't give him the game time he needs and thrives off then we will most likely be sending off on loan, which I would hate to see happen. The Sandro/Parker combo isn't really an issue, as they can play the exact same style of play. The return of Huddlestone throws another player into the mix that will heat up competition. I don't think any of these players are 'squad' players, and I belive they all deserve starting spots. It is a real testament to our squad that we have all these amazing players pushing for spots, but I think it means we might be seeing the backs of vdV and Modric sometime soon.",0,1341550997,null,0,false,0,c5a288a,t3_w3lh1,t1_c5a288a,t3_w3lh1,null,1435703740,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

No author or writer or showrunner has ever used the word canon to describe the show or the expanded universe material. Even Wikipedia articles state that the expanded universe material's relationship to the main tv show is questionable. The closest the BBC ever got to ruling on canon was to say that what happened in the show ""actually happened"", and that's continuity. And don't think that the BBC Charter creates a canon for the show either. Doctor Who doesn't have a canon and personally, that's one of the things I love about this show. All we can say as fans is that we all have our own ""personal canon"".

Canon isn't the general consensus. It's like a legal term- it has a specific and finite meaning that is very slightly different to continuity. It's only Doctor Who that seems to have a problem with ""canon"". And the fact that I'm typing this message out kind of proves it.

&gt; The closest the BBC ever got to ruling on canon was to say that what happened in the show ""actually happened"", and that's continuity.

This right here is a definition of canon. I know the writers have come out and said ""lol it has no canon"", but they're wrong. Everything in the TV show is canon, and all the other extended media is questionable/debatable until it's officially canonized by the TV show itself.

For example, the movie is canon because they refer to McGann as one of the Doctor's regenerations in several episodes. Their decision to do that was effectively their decision to officially state that the movie is canon (And at the same time, decide that the ""Scream of the Shalka"" animation is *not* canon.)

Saying it ""has no canon"" makes absolutely no sense. It has 50 years of canonical episodes. If you had said something like ""Canon is tricky and there is no official guide for what is, and what isn't, part of the canon as far as expanded universe material goes"", I would agree.",0,1341554508,null,0,false,0,c5a2z2e,t3_w3sn2,t1_c5a2z2e,t1_c5a2pzp,null,1435703443,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who doesn't have a canon because canon means (and historically is made because of this meaning) that the material was created by ""the creator"" and has been declared official. Except that Doctor Who does not have one creator. It has hundreds of writers and showrunners and producers and all that stuff. There is no one high authority. There's no George Lucas or Gene Roddenberry.

The BBC may have said that stuff in the show ""actually happened"" but that just means it's part of continuity. I mean, you can't say that it has a canon because someone said it ""actually happened"" and then throw out the fact that the *writers* said it has no canon. You can't just pick and choose which statements you want to accept.

The show has no canon. The McGann movie is continuity, Scream of the Shalka isn't continuity. Which is almost the exact same thing as canon except that it doesn't need the blessing of the higher authority giving it the special label of ""canon"".

Semantics aside, how about the plain old fact that nobody has straight up told us fans that Doctor Who has a canon. And it wouldn't. Because back when the show was made in 1963, the term didn't exist in the same meaning as it does now. Because back in 1963, they didn't even think anybody would be able to watch the episodes ever again- no VCR. Because, when canon finally did become a thing, nobody in authority ever bothered to rule one. RTD purposely left it ambiguous and Steven Moffat thinks its ludicrous.

You may not but some bins, like the bathroom one need lining. 

&gt;Just because you ""reuse"" them as bin liners, doesn't mean their not polluting the environment. What you're doing is no different than just throwing them out, because that's what you're doing.

Of course it is. The reason bags were singled out in the first place was because of how they end up everywhere, particularly in sea and on the sea bed. That is due to irresponsible disposal of bags, and bags that do not biodegrade. Plastic bags from supermarkets are now biodegradable, I am putting a biodegradable bag full of rubbish, inside a normal black bin back which then goes to its usual destination, like it would if there was no plastic bag. The ones I don't use get recycled. There is no pollution of the environment by bags by me, you are making a false argument and detracting from the point that plastic bags can be reused appropriately without ending up on the sea floor.

true,LORDJEW_VAN_CUNTFUCK,smith,Smith,"Canon is continuity. What's ""real"" and what isn't. What actually ""happened"" in that fictional universe. Usually it's pretty easy to distinguish because you can just ignore everything that is unofficial. But there are lots of cases where the extended media *is* official. And in those cases, the creator usually decides. But DW can't really do that either. Because there *is* no real creator. And even showrunners are temporary. But considering DW started off as a TV show, it's easy to see that as the centre piece. The *real* stuff. The original. So that is stuff that ""happened"". And everything else is a grey area. Neither canon nor non-canon. Of course the TV show is so extensive that it contradicts itself and retcons so it's all confusing. But that happens.

And it really doesn't even matter if Moffat claims the show has no canon. His authority is temporary and limited to a few seasons. He has the power to *make* things canon and to un-canonize others (retcons) by writing it in to the show. But he doesn't have the power to just say ""There is no canon"", because that isn't a fact you can introduce to the show. That is a *real-life* thing. Completely outside the DW universe. He has no jurisdiction over that.

But I guess without an official committee to tell us which one of us is right (Although I think that BBC can be considered that), this argument could go on forever. But, really, you can't say something has *no* canon. You could say it has no *official* canon (although I don't think that's true either). I think you should say that it has rough canon. And that is that everything in the show is ""true"" and all the stories and facts outside of the show are up to debate.

Hence ""That's pretty questionable as far as canon goes.""

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"So the writers and show runners can't decree what classifies as canon (tv, books, dramas) and the BBC doesn't tell us if tv, books and dramas are canon. But you've suddenly decided on your own that it's only the tv show that's canon? Even though you just said that nobody that can rule has ruled?

No I think that canon and continuity are different. The difference is that canon trumps continuity because it's something that is decreed by an authority. But since we have no authority, canon is useless. We just have continuity. And that's all we need.

Of course you can say something has *no* canon. Why is the concept of a franchise not having a canon confusing? Everything has a continuity, but not everything has a canon. I mean, Doctor Who couldn't possibly have had what we call a ""canon"" back in 1963 right? There was no such thing. Canon is something we fans made up for Doctor Who because it didn't have one by the time other big franchises started getting them.

And a ""non-official canon"" is like an oxymoron. Canon is official-ness and authority. That's a contradiction in terms right there. I mean, I guess you could call ""continuity"" a ""non-official canon"" but that's just head-hurting.

&gt;I think you should say that it has a rough canon

Oh bother. Rough canon??? Now we're going to start making up all kinds of weird in-betweens about canon.

But again, why did you suddenly decide that the tv show is the only thing that is true canon? Nobody in authority said it. Why does you being the one saying it, make it official? Because ""it's easy to see [the tv show] as the centre piece""? So it's common sense, and that's why it's canon? I must be crazy because that doesn't make sense to me. And even if a ton of other people agreed with you, canon still isn't ""the general consensus"" or ""the majority"".

What makes sense to me is that nobody in authority has ruled it, so it is not so. And we have no authority to go about and decide on our own canons. Canons don't have to exist.

And gosh why would we want them to? Look at this stupid argument we're in. And in the end, it's not going to make a difference on the show or any of the materials.

&gt; But to address the question about whips directly, it’s a really tricky issue. It is absolutely essential to have people performing some of the roles of whips – managing business, helping to organize MPs etc. There are lots of practical issues they solve!

&gt; One particularly problem is that there is simply no way that an MP can be on top of all the detailed nuances of every possible vote. For example, on Tuesday there was a single debate covering some 150 or so amendments (many linked) to the Localism Bill. Some of them were extremely technical, and in principle, any could be put to a vote. You need some way to trust the judgement of a colleague, who actually has spent the hours and hours immersed in the detail of it!

&gt; Having said that, when an MP feels strongly on an issue, they should be free to rebel, and that should not be stopped. I’ve never had a problem with that, and I’ve rebelled on a few issues now. I;ve allowed our whips to give a counter argument to my position, which seems fair, and then made a decision. No undue pressure has been put on me – none of the veiled, or not-so-veiled threats one reads about!

&gt; I would like to see more free votes, and more opportunities for unwhipped votes where that is possible – we’ve created a backbench business committee, which is not controlled by the whips, and can propose motions for debate, and we’ve made select committee chairs and members elected, rather than appointed, so they are more independent. 

I suspect, though, that the Lib Dem whips are not very similar to those from the main two parties.",0,1341564353,null,0,false,0,c5a4f1g,t3_w2ze6,t1_c5a4f1g,t3_w2ze6,null,1429308950,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,DB_Cooper101,null,null,"I have lived in London and Birmingham and my example was just what I have done in my town. I do not think this could happen in many of the places I have lived but just gave an example of one of the many things that a person looking to give up some time can do. 

I always hear comments about people living off the system and living a great life but I have seen it only in the vast minority of cases. The most frequent times I have seen where from people who are criminals and benefit fraud was just part of their lifestyle.  I have just been offered a job that will make £10 a week difference to me and getting to and from work ect will cost me more than £10 a week but I will do that. Others may not as they do not see the point when they feel that they have been written off when all they see are stories of how they are all just scroungers. Benefit fraud such as you have highlighted costs the UK £1 billion a year, errors by the DWP is over £4 billion a year, late payments of tax £5 billion a year and tax avoidance £70 billion (world bank figures on the last two, NAO figures for the first two) but until recently the only stories I saw in the news where about the unemployed scroungers that are destroying Britain. 

I do not think we need to cut benefits even more to force the majority into work but we could do with making work more attractive, higher wages, subsidises public transport for people on low wages and help with the appalling cost of childcare. Yep you can earn more from dealing or fraud but I do not see that changing anytime soon until the government changes the drug policy. 

As for the aggressive attitude, yep I see it every day and it is just pathetic. Few murders happen in my area but all but two over the last twenty years happened within 500 m of my present home. I do not know what drives it but people appear locked into a mentality that ‘respect’ is always due and not displaying it is a grievous insult. Well I always thought respect was something you worked hard to achieve by being a decent human being. But in my own experience is that this is just some form of pecking order and unless behaviour is challenged it will never be changed. 

Idiots around here do get into knife fights with people from other places and I just do not get why they are in a conflict with one area of deprivation against another area of deprivation. What the hell are they fighting over? Luckily firearms offenses are very rare, I can only remember one incident in the last 3 years.  

But as I have said this is just an example of what can be done but it is dependent on your local area, I would not even attempt this in a higher crime area but unless we build walls and gates around such areas, which I do not want, such things will effect more people as time goes on. 

I’m sorry you feel that you must move from your home, I do feel that about my country at times, but if all the people that are positive examples of what can be done leave an area what will then influence that street, city or country?

I heartily agree with that.

However something like the LC opens up a world of overtaking opportunities that wouldn't be possible on a 125, and allows you crash at higher speeds. I'd still agree that it's not as big a factor as experience though.

I can't think of any way to legislate for experience (after all, you've got to get it somewhere, generally by scaring yourself when you get it wrong) but staged tests with the incentive of a bigger bike is about as close as you can get. 

Perhaps preventing new riders from carrying passengers might be a good idea too.

However, it would probably be just as effective to require CAR drivers to take repeated tests.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Welp I just finished watching. Man the top 4-ish things I'd change...

First that they would take out the lines ""Who. Am. I?!"" and ""Great, I finally meet the right guy and he's from another planet!"" That second one doesn't even make sense character or plot-wise.

And then I would get some tailored clothes on these people! The Master's coat and Grace's coat when they go to the institute SO do not fit. Like they had no tailoring time. And let's not mention the Master's Gallifreyan outfit. Well more than just the clothes...the Master's wacky eyes and goo-snake form...just general sci-fi designs for the Master.

Also, I would take out the half human thing. Not because I have a problem with him being half-human (I've kinda made my peace with that one), but because it's so sci-fi gimmicky. Like Spock being half human. And it just adds onto the pile of random mythos that has no significance to the general audience that has never heard of Doctor Who. And he didn't even need to be half-human for the plot, it was just so audiences could relate better.

And the other thing.... At the beginning of the movie when it talks about Daleks and Gallifrey and the Master. I feel sorry for the uninformed.

But I do think that at times, the dialogue shined. And that the plot made sense. Even if it was kind of...erm executed painfully. And I loved the various camera shots and angles that they did. McGann was great, so was Grace (I loved her more mature personality, compared to the young new Who companions we have). And Chang Lee wasn't too bad, and props for first on screen Asian companion. Oh and all the classic Who references!

The other thing I love about this movie that keeps me coming back for more, is that it's like classic Who and new Who put together into some kind of weird mish mash. When I want the nostalgia and feel of older Who but not so old that the pacing makes you want to roll over and die, then this movie is what you need.",0,1341570054,null,0,false,0,c5a4y59,t3_w3sn2,t1_c5a4y59,t1_c5a4ts4,null,1435703173,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If, as I've said elsewhere, they were presenting a historical account of the many arguments that have been made about the origin of the Giant's Causeway, then that's fine.  It has appropriate context.

To insert additional information about how the argument still continues to this day is pandering to those with a willing ignorance of the truth.  The fact that they actually engaged with these people beggars belief.

I think the issue is with the abuse of the welfare system, obviously their are those who genuinely need the support in times of hardship (I was on JSA for 3 months until I got a job for example.) but the issue is the people claiming, who will do anything possible to not have to pay their way.

I don't agree those on DSS should be forced to live with strangers (Your analogy is good, however a lot of people on DSS will probably never earn enough to buy a house, so the comparison between say an unemployed labourer and a London Businessman/woman doesn't really work well.), but it seems like this will be a neccesity until their is a way to effectively force those abusing the system, out of the system. 

I usually don't agree with the Tories, but I do commend them for at least trying to sort this out (whether what they're doing is the right thing, is entirely debatable and partially subjective), the welfare system has gotten out of hand and has gone from being a crutch to support people until they get back on their feet to a full life support machine for the lazy and inept.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes yes, you are so funny and so original. As someone who takes my safety very seriously it's very tiresome when these smart-alec remarks get trotted out every time motorbikes are mentioned. Many motorcyclists call riders who are irresponsible 'squids' and don't appreciate being lumped in with them.

The A&amp;E people only see the injured bikers, not the bikers who have not been injured and actually had fun and got home safely and without incident. So it's a somewhat skewed perspective. Plus, it's not like every motorbike accident automatically leads to horrific trauma and death. The risks are higher but it is possible to fall off or whatever and *not* die, depending on the circumstances, of course. 

While I don't deny that motorbikes are dangerous a lot of it is related to the rider themselves and their behaviour. Any rider can do a lot to keep themselves safe and still enjoy their ride. So, if you are someone who actually pays attention to staying alive, it gets really annoying to hear this crap that is basically calling you stupid and irresponsible. No, I just need a little bit more than the average person to get my jollies. This doesn't mean I have no idea of the risks involved and take no precautions against them. Motorcyclists are not all feckless idiots.

Also, if it weren't for the quantity and behaviour of many car drivers on the road, all vulnerable road users would be safer - motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians. Pedal cyclists can be pretty vulnerable too but for some reason we never hear people harping on about that at every opportunity. I guess it's because they don't get to plough into trees at 130mph.

The jet stream usually sits waaay north of the UK during a hot summer, I believe the jet streams are ribbons of air that form where cold Arctic air moving south meets warm tropical air moving north.

Where the 2 meet it causes convection, and that is basically what a jet stream is.

Every summer more and more polar ice is melting, so I am visualizing this in my head a bit like when you leave the freezer door open on a warm day, you see lots of cold wet vapour coming out of the fridge which is the ice within beginning to react to the warmer air by melting....so....in effect what are seeing in our weather is like a giant version of this....

Cool wet air meets warm dry air, the 'wet' condenses and we get a fucktonne of never-ending rain, yay!

The jet stream has been sitting either on or just south of the UK for months now I've been watching it every day here:  http://www.wunderground.com/global/EU_2xJT_Index.html

I think this might be because there is so much melting of Arctic ice that the cold damp air is over-ruling the Azores high that we'd usually associate with a warm summer.

Something like that anyway......

Erm, what do you think the 'legal reasons' are about? The 'legal reasons' are there for safety..

A major problem for motorcyclists is being seen by car drivers, so high viz jackets are an obvious bonus there. They can also influence how car drivers perceive you - safe and responsible, etc. It shouldn't matter but that can affect how they treat you. 

Simply throwing your hands in the air and being helpless will increase your chances of getting killed. Taking responsibility for your actions and not being fatalistic is where humanity progresses.

That sounds like something that is based on *fact* rather than opinion. Time will tell whether it helps or not.

Fact is, too many people do indeed get hurt and die on our roads. It's not just motorcyclists but they are obviously very vulnerable and make up an awful number of the fatalities.

Inexperienced drivers are most likely to get themselves hurt. When you hear of a head on smash into a wall, killing all four or five occupants in the car, the driver is almost always a young male. Obviously that's an extreme example, but younger and less experienced drivers are not being persecuted without reason.

But with my CV no one wanted to give me a job, I don’t drink, swear do drugs and have never been in trouble with the police but the simple fact that the lack of knowledge about people like myself means many people just do not want to take a chance, 80% of people with perceived mental health problems are unemployed, of those that are many are underemployed in that they are under paid and work short hours. 

Thanks to having the chance to do an access course I got to a university, a good redbrick on a course that will allow me to use my knowledge to help others with mental health problems.  If this change goes through unchallenged then many people like myself will just be condemned to a life on jobseekers with less and less support. 88% of people with mental health problems want to work, I have helped others to get onto courses and into jobs rather than just wasting their lives as the jobs are not there for people with mental health problems, even if like me you have overcome them. 

If anyone else has had the experience of what this second chance does mean to them please could you share. 

So please can you all consider writing to your MP, having done an access course can I give you some recent real world figures, on my course of the people that started 84% passed and 74% went on to university (this would be higher but many applied for midwifery courses), and the courses people are going for? Teaching, nursing, social work, and similar courses, no one gave up a year of their life to do a course to do things like ICT, business studies or media studies. All want to go into roles that help and support people.  Many did not have a chance at 16-18 to do such a course and this is to them a first chance.  On the course the where people who held down minimum wage jobs, single parents or people who  were  out of work or underemployed, many received benefits of one sort or the other, not because they were on a course and didn’t work but because that is a fact of life for many low paid people in this country.

Now they are going to university and will be going into professions that mean they will probably never need benefits for the rest of their working life. No government sponsored work program in this country can even come close to that.

So what do you want to happen? People not going onto course due to the fear of debt and professions being increasing dominated by those that have never faced unemployment or poverty or a society where we invest in people so they can get off benefits forever and work in roles that support the further development of this society? 

Thank you for your time.

If a landlord has a choice between placing a private tenant at 250/wk (pre benefit cut) at what it is WORTH to the market OR place someone on DSS and letting the council pay what they can CHARGE (i.e., the maximum allowable) then surely they will pick the latter. We all would. Let's not kid around, here.

With that incentive removed the constant one-upmanship that has gripped (especially London) will ease down as landlords can no longer rely on the councils subsidising their homes. Will it fix London's property market? No. But it will help. It already is.

Depends what you're looking for really. Personally I much prefer the older buildings with their high ceilings and period features, but I went to dinner at a friend's flat in a purpose built block of flats down in Morningside a few months ago, and it was a lovely, modern place, with a lift, underground car parking etc. Not actually too far from the hospital down there at all, in fact. Was quite expensive though - the place had gates to drive in and stuff.

Have you been to Edinburgh before? I appreciate you say your wife wants an easy commute...but pretty much any commute within Edinburgh is fairly easy - the city centre itself is really quite small.

true,starspangledpickle,eng-GreaterLondon,LONDON IS BEST. KNOW YOUR PLACE.,"&gt; We're not talking about temporary accommodation for students we're talking about permanent homes and giving people the opportunity to create one. Remember that housing rules apply to everyone from the unemployed to the permanently disabled.

People in London graduate at 21-22 and immediately go from a shared home with students to... a shared home with students and/or young professionals! Depending on your ""career"" it can take you 5, 6, or even 10 years before you get your footing in life and you can afford to live in somewhere not shit on your own.

Young professionals do it not because they necessarily want to, *but because that's life in London today*. Either try and make it work in London or possibly not at all, depending on your profession and skills. Why should it be different for people on housing benefits? What makes *them* special?

Why should the middle classes bust their balls to make ends meet and make life work when you can lounge it up and do nothing and get it handed to you on a silver platter? Middle classes make tough economic choices if they want children: can we afford it; who will do child care, can we even afford to pay for it with two working adults. The lazy sods who want handouts just have 'em and expect everyone else to accommodate them in the name of ""fair.""

Episode 3 of new who: several gelth die

Episode 4 of new who: several politicians were killed and the Slitheen use their skin.

Episode 5 of new who: The Slitheen get wiped out, presumably some humans in the building also die. 

Episode 6 of new who: Dozens of humans die and a dalek dies too.

Episode 7 of new who: Several humans are known to be dead (yet their bodies still utilized). Jagrafass gets killed too.

Episode 8 of new who: Several humans are shown to die by the Reapers who came to clean the timewound. Unknown if fixing the paradox saved them.

Episode 9 of new who: WWII, enough said...

Episode 10 of new who: Everybody close enough to the Doctor lives....while thousands die a bit further away because of the war.

Episode 11 of new who: They deliver the last of the Slitheen to their homeplanet where she will be executed.

Episode 12 of new who: Several people die on screen.

Episode 13 of new who: Even more people and daleks, die on screen.

Episode 14 of new who (Christmas invasion): The cygorax get destroyed. A couple of humans get killed too.

true,Education_throwaway,null,null,"&gt; their decision to fuck up and not appreciate the decent, free education they were offered earlier? 

The fact that you consider this to be true means that you know little about this subject. 

I would suggest that you could do with improving your level of education, maybe on an access course? We are the 7th richest country in the world but are ranked 45th in literacy rate. Many people who do these courses receive benefits of some form or another but after getting on a degree programme do you think they will need any support for the rest of their working lives? Now this is a simple question do you want people to live in poverty and on benefits or do you want to invest in people so they can contribute financially and in many other ways to the country. 

What do you think will be best value for the country in the long run? My course got 74% of people into university (it would be higher but midwifery courses are popular and hard to get into, discounting midwifery it is more like 92% of people that started the course).  Consider this in relation to the work programme that costs more per head and according to the government’s own figures of the first 300 000 only 22% got into work, and how many of those still needed some housing or council tax benefit due to only having the chance of a low paid role?

As for a second chance? Many of the people on my course left school at 16 and have worked for over ten years in roles like care work, many did not have a choice due in this.  For most is was the first chance at university I was one of the few that it was a second chance and if I can afford it after university I will sponsor others through an access course.  Also as I took my A levels over five years ago they would not be considered by any University so the 24 year old cut off means that many looking to go to uni as mature students after working for a few years will find that the good grades they did get will not be considered at they are over five years old.  

I also dislike the attitude that if you make an error at 16 you should live in poverty for the rest of your life, I know what I do and I know that I would have not achieved that with my limited knowledge at 16.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I would tend to agree with you. The only caveat I would add is:

--Cole----Terry/Luiz-----Cahill------Ivanovic--

-----------------------Cech--------------------

I think the common denominator in our defense is Cahill, not Luiz or Terry. Purely based on talent, I would much rather have Terry and Luiz on the field. However, Terry and Luiz both depend on a very risky, balls-to-the-wall, last-ditch defensive style.

Throughout his career, Terry has had a good partner in defense that has covered for him and allowed him to take risks to intercept passes or make tackles. The most notable example is Carvalho, and there have been a large number of bad partners along the way.

Terry and Luiz are very similar in that both take risks in defense that often work out well since both are skilled tacklers. The problem is that if you don't have a partner who is dependable, more level-headed, and more likely to drop back and cover rather than go in for the challenge, risky missed tackles turn directly into goals (see: AVB era defense with Terry and Luiz or Terry and Ivanovic-- so many defenders caught out of position).

Cahill is a much more consistent, quiet, non-risk-taking defender than either Terry or Luiz. He doesn't have the pace of Luiz or the prowess of Terry (yet), and he knows it. This often leads him to drop back and cover in defense, hoping for a block or a less-risky interception. In my opinion, that is exactly what we need to partner Terry/Luiz in defense.

For the record, I would start Terry and Cahill next season, and I would assume that from the next season on, Luiz/Cahill are my central defense of the future.",0,1341589353,null,0,false,0,c5a7up1,t3_w4kot,t1_c5a7up1,t3_w4kot,null,1429310180,11,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,11

You do not get into a good university without a good level 3 qualification in this country. This is about those level 3 (and level 2 in the case of basic skills) courses that allow you to apply to university. 

The university fees have had a dramatic effect on university applications this year as for someone, however smart, living in a poor house hold the idea of £27 000 of debt is just a stopping point, irrespective of the rate of payback of this just the number has stopped people, adding another £3 000 to this will just be too much for many capable people. I like the idea of having teachers, social workers, psychologists and nurses that come from poor back grounds and not just the middle classes.

25% of people will receive treatment for mental health problems at some point in their lives, you have cluster points in the terms of age where mental health problems develop and puberty and late teens are cluster points. I had a complex of issues and although I first received mental health support at 15 it was over a decade before I overcame it, I should point out I was employed full time throughout that period.  

On my course I know many people where those that had also overcome such issues, as well as abusive environments and levels of poverty that I did not consider still happened today.  And yep some just did not do the work when they were in school but that was the minority. 

If you did look into issues like education inequality you can only come to the conclusion that the individualism argument just is not valid, and I cannot see how anyone could consider themselves to be of the left and not consider this a mistake that will just mean that the only people that will get a so called second chance will be the rich.  Social mobility is extremely low in this country and this move can only reduce it more, smart people happen everywhere and given the recent report that suggested that even the brightest students will be two years behind I want a chance for everyone to contribute to our society not just those that are rich.

We do not let people drink, smoke, drive or vote at 16 as they lack understanding so why do you consider that they should only have one chance at education when we don’t even trust them to buy a beer at that age? And if you are in a poor environment you may have been brought up, as some classmates where, being told hey where stupid and had to go to work then found after working for a few years that they were in fact rather smart (including Mensa members).

obviously don't think inflation has been taken into account there. and of course there are all sorts of other considerations; cost of rebuilding (after the war, after the recession - which we're not out of yet - etc etc.)

but I'm not sure you can say WW2 alone was more expensive than the bank bailout. 

and I'm not sure it's exactly fair to compare a war to a bank bailout, as the principal function of a war is not as an economic concern or programme. however, wars tend to generate production and increase output (stimulating economies), whereas our bailout hasn't. wasn't it Krugman who was calling for an alien invasion to kick start the world economy again?

true,tastymoonpie,kernow,loves Cornwall,"Hello there. :)  I am an American teacher who has been living in the UK for almost five years now.  I am married to a Brit, but wasn't for the first 3 years.  Just wanted to share some information I know.

First of all, you should be aware that there has been a policy change in regards to qualified teacher status from American trained teachers.  As of April, 2012, teachers from the states do NOT need to be trained to get English teaching qualifications (which takes a year otherwise), which is potentially really awesome for you.  It would probably be a bit fiddly to get a job in the first place, but once you did, you'd pretty much be set.  I think it's a lot more likely to get a job based on your specialist area than a janitorial job (unemployment is fairly high in quite a few places in the UK now, so I don't think many companies would pay a couple thousand quid for your work permit to get you to scrub toilets when there are a dozen Brits applying for the same position).  

You can sign up to various teacher recruitment agencies with your CV (resume) and potentially get interviews for teaching positions.  I think usually you would be asked to come into the school to teach a lesson as part of your interview, but it might be possible to either conduct a telephone interview (without the teaching, of course) or maybe even fly over for a visit and do some interviews while just visiting the country.  If you were able to do that, you might luck out and get a job offer, and then if you accepted it your new school would apply for a work visa on your behalf. I think you are allowed to stay in the UK as a visitor for up to six months, so if you are able to save up money to live off of while here, you could plan to do some serious job hunting when you were here on a visit with the hope of returning to live.  

As an American, you would not be eligible for a working holiday visa mentioned by someone else.  The only other option I'm aware of would be to come here for university, but I believe you have to be in full-time education to qualify and there is a limit to the number of hours you'd be allowed to work while in school (I think it is 10 hours per week).  

I hope that's helpful.  Best wishes!  :) ",0,1341590469,null,0,false,0,c5a84la,t3_w4ket,t1_c5a84la,t3_w4ket,null,1429310472,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

That's the problem, compared to away shirts, really: I only have enough money to buy one shirt if I'm going to buy one during a season - and I'll often favour the latest home kit over an away one. The decision is also made easier because (like a true Yorkshireman!) I love a bargain and often buy shirts towards the end of a season, when the home shirts are on sale, while they often keep the latest away kit at a high price because it'll be used again in the following season.

Road craft is road craft, and lets face it most of the training is about being a defensive driver and pretty much always has been.  If you have proven yourself to be capable of driving safely enough to get a full license, then it makes sense to qualify you for larger similar vehicles.

Granted, I passed my driving tests 20+ years ago (car &amp; bike), but I have regularly driven 7.5 tonners (the wife has a 7.5 ton horse box, for moving her herd around in), and vehicles with trailers attached (horsie trailers if you haven't guessed).

Where do you draw the line?  Are transit vans considered too far from a car, because you can certainly get a ton or two in some of them...  What about camper vans?  They're not heavy but they are big...

Obviously, when you get into the territory of heavy goods vehicles, with air-brakes, split range gearboxes, and articulation, or very heavy loads in large vehicles that need a new set of skills to control, then yes, more training and another license.

And the same goes for vehicles where you are carrying a lot of us fragile humans; a public service vehicle license makes sense too, you really don't want someone with too little training responsible for getting little Jimmy and his 60 school friends 100 miles down the M1 and round the M25 for their school trip.

&gt;The proportion of licensed motorcycles with engine sizes over 500 cc has increased from 45 per cent in 1999 to 75 per cent in 2009. Conversely, 11 per cent of licensed motorcycles in 2009 had an engine size of 50 cc or less, down from 14 per cent a decade earlier. 

and

&gt;Around half of motorcyclists are aged between 30 and 49 years. Less than 10% of motorcyclists are aged 19 years or young, and 15% were aged 20 to 29 years. Just over one quarter are aged 50 years and over.

It also mostly makes sense. the 400-500 cc class has died out over the past couple decades.back when those sizes were raced, a lot of bikes were produced. now the majority of 400-500cc bikes are a couple of dual sports and used bikes from the 80s. 

it may be a bit different in europe, but almost every bike here goes from 250cc then jumps up to 600-650cc and over. there are no new touring bikes available under 600cc, the only sportbikes available under that are generally models from the 80s and 90s still being produced(with the exception of the kawi ninja400 which is actually a 650cc bike with a smaller motor slapped in it.)",0,1341595190,null,0,false,0,c5a9bsc,t3_w4aoa,t1_c5a9bsc,t1_c5a81nm,null,1429311038,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,IndecentExposure,null,null,"Answering your ""sell to buy"" question, according to  The Guardian, we are hoping to sell Adebayor to Tottenham and Santa Cruz to Betis or QPR, probably to cut wages then anything (a move I would support regardless of whether we made a move for RvP).

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that Tottenham will be able to afford 170k a week for Adebayor, and I doubt he will be willing to take a pay cut so I imagine that we will agree to pay 30-50% of his wages until his contract expires.

In response to your ""do we want him"" question, I can only speak on behalf of myself, and my answer is no, I do not. And it's not because of any ""rivalries"", I would be happy to sign a player from any club as long as they performed. The reason I do not want RvP is that even without Adebayor and Santa Cruz I believe we are on the borderline between having lots of depth and overcrowding the squad, mainly in terms of strikers. The last thing we need, I believe anyway, is another ego causing problems in the squad. As well as that, I would argue that we have at least two strikers who have the potential to play at the same level as RvP, if they are on form (Aguero and Tevez) as well as Balotelli who I still believe has the potential to become one of the best strikers in the world in the next 2 or 3 seasons. Adding his poor injury record and his age, I believe RvP would never really offer enough to merit his likely huge wage demands, as well as his transfer cost.

The only scenario in which I would want to sign RvP is if Tevez and Dzeko both left during the summer, which I admit is a real possibility.

For the CAM and the Wings it's really a dilemma. Sure ideally we can gamble by putting Hazard on the RW and have him play similarly to CR in Portugal. Mata should maintain his LW position simply because one of the best in the world at that position. For CAM I'll probably have to go with Meireles. I think that his attributes and sense of playing could make him a great pairup with Torres upfront.

exist unless or until S.107 (2A) is amended or repealed.

But what you haven't acknowledged is that Theresa May set up an independent inquiry to examine the extradition treaty -- prompted by the O'Dwyer case. (Why was it commissioned? Because just like Labour right now, the Tories and Lib Dems had played the tune everybody wanted to hear while they were in opposition.) It found that the treaty favoured the British public, because our extradition process is more complex. It's 488 pages, and [viewable online](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police/operational-policing/extradition-review?view=Binary). Obviously, all UK media outlets, left or right, tabloid or not, have taken care to skimp over this review -- people would prefer a more patriotic, exciting narrative that caters to existing stereotypes of the US.
2. All pathos, no logos. The extradition treaty is fair in that it balances the rights of both the UK and the US. Is your problem with the treaty being unfair, the idea of extradition, the United States itself, the Coalition government (for not repealing the treaty), or the fact that someone is getting in trouble for breaking copyright law?  
3. 'No man should live in fear of the government'? Not even if they break the law? As Mr O'Dwyer so clearly did.
4. I do get the feeling that reddit's response would be rather different if it was Canada rather than the US, or if the guy had killed someone rather than set up a dodgy internet site. The point being that neither of these things should really make a difference -- people don't like the US and they don't like copyright law and they certainly don't like the fact that Britain doesn't exist in a vacuum like North Korea and therefore cannot maintain sovereignty... that explains the poll results, and the stance of the hivemind.

Part of my course means that I get to meet students from other courses and institutions that I will encounter professionally in a few years’ time. 

As I am at a good University I get mental health support that has been excellent, it does not give me an advantage it just helps me prepare and if I have a problem I can go and see someone that same day, I never have and hope never to need it but the fact it is there is wonderful. 

I have fellow students that do just as well as me but have parents that pay the bills, they do not have to work and have a great social life at university, I do not mind that but I do not think I am doing the same degree as them as I have less time to do the same work as I have to support myself, I will be annoyed if I miss out on a first just due to the fact I have less time to do the same essay. 

So is any of that fair? Is it going to be a better or worse country if we make access to higher education more about how much money you have? And the amount of money we are talking about could be found just by getting  companies to pay their taxes on time, not even looking at none payment but this is the same amount of money that we lose every year from companies that just put off paying taxes to make a balance sheet look good. 

OU fees have just gone up and support has gone down so if you started your degree again today with the OU would you be able to afford to do it? 

Do you think that your life would be better if you were not part of the 20% of people with mental health problems that are in work or the 5% that have a higher-level qualification? Would you have liked the opportunities that a less divided society would give? Do you think maybe you are exceptional and have achieved a wonderful thing but maybe others are not as smart or as hard working as you but still should have a chance at a better life?

For me this comes down to luck, I want a better world than that and the access system gives that at a low cost and gets people off benefits for good.

I accepted the risks, I wore the armour and the helmet, I accepted I had to spend 10 minutes getting ready to ride getting dressed, taking off the locks and warming the engine up before I went anywhere, rather than jumping in my car and being en route in 20 seconds.  

Basically I just really enjoyed the riding enough for it to more than offset the down sides.  

I was fully aware of the increased risks of injury and death, I was also aware that if I did have an accident it probably would not be my fault.  I also knew that the rigour of the training for my license was higher and the standards I was held to in the test were higher too.  (Twice the [lifesaver](http://www.begin-motorcycling.co.uk/elc4.htm) stopped me running over a cyclist overtaking me on the inside as I turned into a side road, despite me slowing down and indicating my intent to turn).

I can honestly say I never arrived at work in my car with a big grin on my face, but it happened pretty often on my bike.

Plus with a big enough engine (north of 400cc) you can accelerate hard enough to tear your face off.  But only on track days of course.

The doctor can speak sign-language ASL or otherwise. (and by speak I mean sign) he could easily translate for his companion and by extension the viewer as he did with the flys in planet of the dead.

As for the TARDIS actually translating for the deaf character my best guess would be they understand by lip reading and body signs. The TARDIS makes sure they can understand by allowing them to understand physical positioning of the body (that would convey emotion and meaning and such) as well as heightened lip reading abilities.

Mata being so deep would necessitate him putting in a big defensive shift, which isn't his strength, and would make him clock up some serious miles. Ramires can handle both those aspects, but he's a genetic freak. Going forward, you'd have Mata and Ramires overlapping Hulk and Hazard, requiring our full backs to stay behind and cover the gap

I think the problem we have is no Ballack, no Makalele and a declining Lampard. Those 3 could dominate this formation because they were unbelievably well-rounded, or in the case of Makalele, so suited to his role they named the position after him

With a black/white split in the team, 5 defensive men and 5 attackers, I feel we'd end up with no link up in midfield. Someone like Modric is valuable because like Xavi, he keeps play ticking over and can play the killer pass from slightly deeper. Just like a classic centre-half pairing has one brutish spoiler and one ball playing defender (Terry and Luiz, for example), I think our midfield would be best suited with a defensive shield (Mikel, Romeu) and a creative playmaker (Modric, Lampard)

We got overrun a lot last season because our midfield was weak and we couldn't rely on them to keep play going, so we hoofed the ball forward and negated most of what Torres could contribute

I think the 4-3-3 can work, but we'd need pure wingers like the old days as opposed to players playing the winger role, which I think is what Hazard and Hulk would be doing",0,1341603326,null,0,false,0,c5abiof,t3_w4tuc,t1_c5abiof,t1_c5abdl0,null,1429312071,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Don't be too bothered about restaurants, pubs etc, there's lots of decent ones all over and anyway the city is very walkable/buses (bit hit and miss getting a pram on buses mind you, though sister swears by those baby carriers). I usually say do not bother with a car unless you have a specific need, but that might not be viable with kids.  If you do need a car, take care checking the parking, council permits can be pricey and don't guarantee you a spot. 

If you see a promising ad you can have a look using Streetview, any areas ""to steer clear of"" are pretty obvious. Def check out the property in person before committing to a lease though, to check out the general upkeep, quality of furniture etc. 

London landlords generally seem to take relatively good care of the properties, I guess since the level of rents means costs are relatively small. Also here crap landlords don't go out of business easily since there's always some last-minute students having to take the crap flats. 

Do check with prospective landlord whether there's an additional service/stair charge. It's standard for the landlord to cover it but better to be sure beforehand. Council tax + water on the other hand will be additional to the rent, usually sort it yourself though some landlords will arrange it for you. The council tax banding can make a significant difference as to what's affordable and what's not - and be sure to include water charges. Also, check out whether she qualifies for a [student discount](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/612/council_tax-discounts_and_reductions/1231/apply_for_students_council_tax_discount_or_exemption/1).

No doubt a few folk will post suggesting to avoid certain property managers, there's always someone complaining about Grant Management. Personally I'd favour private landlords, but as always it's hit and miss. Far as I can tell the main ways to find flats are through Gumtree, ESPC and LettingWeb.

I don't mean this in a mean way, but trying to manipulate people into giving you attention isn't cool. Not only is it ineffective but it's also the sort of behavior that we try to discourage. 

Just like with the title of your post. It's a cool picture. I like it. But when you add ""Probably won't get any upvotes :/"" what I read is:

&gt; Probably won't get any upvotes :/, you should prove me wrong and give me attention and upvotes

That sort of thing is usually fine for someplace like /r/gonewild because even though we can see that she's trying manipulate us into giving her attention, we have a compelling reason - tits - to overlook it. Here, we don't. Here, we see the attempted manipulation for attention and downvote. So you'll get downvotes, like mine of your post, not because it's a poor quality submission but because it's so incredibly obvious that the line at the end is just a weak attempt to get people to say ""Oh, he says he won't get any upvotes, well I'll show him and give him an upvote!"".

You need to learn to talk without attempting to manipulate people into giving you attention. It's transparent, and it's behavior we try to discourage.

So be done posting if you like. Or don't be done. Do whatever you want to do, I don't care.

The main range is the monthly range with Doctors 5-8. Then the 8th Doctor range. The Gallifrey series. The UNIT series. The I, Davros and Cyberman mini-series. The Sarah Jane stuff, etc.

I suggest you start with the main range- the monthly series. It is the largest range. It has around 160 stories so far. More to come. If you are dedicated to hearing them all, then buy the subscription to save a lot of money- meaning you pay X amount of money and get 6 or 12 consecutive stories to download or order on CD.

They are expensive though. If you buy them download-only it's half the price. If you want a physical CD you have to wait for them to ship it.

They're very good and fun to listen to. Though, if you start at the beginning of the monthly range, they're still getting on their feet. If you just want recommendations I can do that too.

Virgin are the only ones I've not really heard of beyond it's name and logo and the slight mention of one or two books from it, but I've seen they had the licence too so as long as it doesn't conflict with anything, then it's fine.

true,scg30,1953,Frank Lampard,"&gt;I'd rather have him and save money on the RW position with say, Moses or Walcott, than have Hulk and no Luka if finances are the big concern of the club

This, a million times over.

For all the talk about misfiring strikers and aging defenders, imo the midfield has been the biggest weakness in the team since Ballack and Deco left after Carlo's first season, and then Essien blew his knee *again*. 

In Carlo's second season while Frank spent that long spell on the sidelines with the groin injury, Ramires was still finding his feet in England, and especially after Essien went down injured at the Cup of Nations, our lack of midfield depth was painfully exposed. The situation with Essien has only gotten worse, as we've this year been forced to recognize just what a shadow of his former self he has become.

I think Ramires has now matured enough to replace the once mighty bison who should, regrettably, now be put out to pasture.

On the bright side, bringing in the combination of Hazard and Mata is arguably a sizable improvement over having Deco on a swan-song. Their both slightly different players than Deco was, but their dribbling skills and guile in and around the box redouble the creative magic that Deco's presence offered going forward.

Lampard's longevity is a testament to the man and his immense professionalism, and for my money he's still the best central midfield player in the squad but he obviously wont last forever. In a perfect world McEachran will come good and develop into a homegrown long-term replacement for him. 

Mikel has imo now finally showed enough to be relied upon as a sufficient successor to Makelele's mantle as the defensive holder.(For me the jury on Romeu is still very much out)

However, we still haven't really found a sufficient replacement for Ballack. As much as I've been extremely happy with Meireles' contribution since coming to Chelsea, he's just not the caliber of player that Ballack was. Meireles' versatility is essential for squad depth, but we miss the combination of cultured passing, amply crisp tackling and deep-lying vision that Ballack offered when at his best. 

Modric has all of the above in spades, and more! Buying Modric is almost like buying a Deco/Ballack hybrid (minus the aerial prowess that Ballack's height offered.)  Luka is still relatively young as well, and has the so-called 'prime' of his career ahead of him. I think Modric, or the nearest imitation we can find, should be the highest transfer priority for the club this summer, perhaps even above a supplementary RB.

We work hard to make sure that all of our candidates, who are well-informed on a wide variety of subjects, are very easy to contact, and are able to respond promptly to queries about non-core policy positions. If you would like to get in touch with your local PPUK candidates, campaigns@pirateparty.org.uk will be able to put you in touch with your local PPUK representatives (if any).

As a general note, PPUK supports evidence-based policymaking. Unfortunately, this means that many policies (especially in the areas of the economy, taxation and energy) are likely to start with ""We will conduct a study..."" or words to that effect.

Your questions are fairly loaded. For example, no politician would fail to answer ""Yes"" to the question ""Would [you] be against cuts to the NHS and police forces"".

true,ben9345,english,London,"I'm imagining an apocalyptic wasteland in 30 years, 2042, with signs for 2012 Olympics half fallen down and weeds growing in the roads and a small residence network called 'The Underground' fighting official LOCOG forces. LOCOG's official history lists the 2012 games as the pinnacle of human organisation and their only aim is to return the whole world to this utopian dream of order. The motto of the Second Era Parliament (S.E.P) made up solely of LOCOG puppets is 'Organisation is Paramount'. 

They have a murderous disdain for disorganisation and have created a green-zone of tranquility in the borough of Westminster focused on the renamed 'New Parliament Square' with the rest of London being left to fall in to disrepair. Other inhabitants of London are either killed or fled during the Civil Wars of 2012. LOCOG refused to leave after the games and when the government brought police to their HQ they called in their 'enforcement' group known as 'The Paralegals' to arrest everyone in the Houses of Parliament assassinate the Queen who only went down after heroic hand to hand combat to the death with the [royal sceptre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceptre_with_the_Cross) and the [Sovereign's Orb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign%27s_Orb) which turned out to be a hand grenade. 

Because of its symmetrical organisation, a sacred value for LOCOG, Westminster Central Hall is occupied by 'The Clerics', the warrior-priest class, and is rumoured to be home to 'The Father' or as he was known before the coup, Lord Coe but no-one knows his true location for his own safety. 'The Clerics' are the domestic security service, warrior-priests who worship symmetry, order and harmonies. They are trained to find and seek out disorganisation. People show disorganisation by reacting emotionally to a situation or criticising the utopia. The CCTV network has been upgraded to installations inside people's houses and so tracking down those responsible for 'disorganisational thinking' is simple. They will be subjected to electric shock therapy by The Clerics and if they don't respond they are incinerated.

If anything it's people using pride as a platform for wider views which I TOTALLY AGREE WITH, I'm a raving lefty who spouts rainbows from my very soul, but I don't really think it's a political issue at this level.

true,PeterBrett,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"Strong convictions are a two-edged sword. On the one hand, if a politician feels very strongly about a particular policy, they are more likely to be extremely committed to push it it. On the other hand, they will be less receptive to evidence that doesn't support that policy, regardless of how strong that evidence is.

On the broader issues, having centralised policies can actually prevent candidates from properly taking local issues into account. For example, at a council level, one candidate might be faced with disproportionately high council tax and a hugely inefficient and overstaffed planning department, while another candidate might be standing for election to a council with huge highway maintenance issues and no way to fund improved upkeep other than by a council tax increase. Obviously, these are simplified situations, but I'm sure you can see that avoiding ""one size fits all"" policies for non-core issues helps candidates (or groups of candidates) to tailor their manifestos to better match their constituents' needs.

With respect to studies, I agree with you entirely! We will do our best, but obviously there are limits to what PPUK as a small party not currently in government can achieve, and barring a miracle we will not have the resources to commission studies (or better, randomised trials) of policies. Even designing studies is a process that requires genuine expert input.

true,sucksqueezebangblow1,null,null,"""So the lorry shouldn't have the cab turned to the left like that then."" - Then how on earth do I turn the corner? Perhaps lorries should only be permitted to drive in a straight line and have the steering wheel removed? In the video the lorry and cyclists are all static, in real life they would be moving. For a left hand turn I have swan neck the lorry. That is I have to go out to come back in crossing the centre line of the new road, again necessitating positioning the lorry like that. If I didn't, everyone standing on the pavement on the corner is going to have a bad time.

 A modern lorry already has 5 to 6 mirrors on average. That is a lot of mirror checks, add two cameras in and well, people are going to stop checking, honestly. Most car drivers don't check their mirrors nearly enough and they only have three. Believe me as a motorcyclist I know that all too well.  The problem more than anything is people do not understand how many blind spots there are on a lorry. Never pass on the left. 

Like it or not there is a shared responsibility. I cannot be aware of what is in my left mirror 100% of the time because otherwise I'd rear end the person in front of me because I would have my face welded to the mirror. Its simple enough for a cyclist to not undertake me, its not like you can't see the lorry, I don't see why you're so ready to absolve the cyclist of any responsibility in the situation as if they are totally at the mercy of the lorry driver.  

As for killing people. My mirror checking and generally being a competent motorist has saved the lives of I don't know how many cyclists. Who usually give a wanky wanky gesture as means of thanks when I don't squish them.

true,ksturgis,null,null,"I don't think the two thoughts really correlate. Yes Drogba was large and very powerful (arguably the most powerful striker ever on his day) but the rest of our squad was still the same you listed above with the exception of Hazard and Marin. 

The truth is we haven't been known as a large and powerful squad in years past. But truth be told Torres is roughly 6'1 and isn't necessarily a push over, and we still have Lukaku (aka Drogba 2.0) in the ranks. I don't think we *need* to add players of larger size, as this sport doesn't necessarily benefit larger players. Our two best players last year were Rams and Mata (arguably our tiniest players). Add to that we do have size where it matters (in the back 4). Cahill, Luiz, JT and Iva all have good size. Not to mention ol Petr. 

As long as we have pace, quality, and creativity we'll be fine. I don't think a lack of size is much of a concern at all. ",0,1341620934,null,0,false,0,c5afj66,t3_w5m9y,t1_c5afj66,t3_w5m9y,null,1429313966,13,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,13

Check any price comparison site on this, even the most basic 1.0l car is over £2,000 a year to insure. To insure an exotic car would literally cost at least £1m. The amount of people who would be willing to spend that much money - even if they are that rich - just so their teenagers can drive flash cars is so small it's hardly worth thinking about.

Realistically, even a teenager with a decent amount of money in the bank won't be insuring anything that can get up to a decent speed.",0,1341621023,null,0,false,0,c5afjt2,t3_w4aoa,t1_c5afjt2,t1_c5afelj,null,1429313980,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
