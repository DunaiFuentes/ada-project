I guess my real question is - with my intention fully being to experience as much Old Who as possible - would it be more rewarding to stick with it the way I am now, or just watch the ""popular"" serials. That's what a lot of people told me to do in the beginning which is why I'm coming back to that and wondering if I made a mistake.

Also, kind of related and kind of unrelated: I know Pertwee is a huge fan favorite as well. Have his serials aged as badly as Baker's? I'm wondering if maybe I should recalculate my whole plan and start with him instead of Baker. I thought I was skipping to the better Doctor going off of my childhood memories, but I don't want to make it even harder to go back to Pertwee's serials after watching Baker's if they're even lower in quality. 

I've watched a ""lot"" (relative to what ""a lot"" means in this case lol) of the 1st Doctor, but nothing of the 2nd (I hear much/most of his stuff is lost?) or 3rd. 

Low production values usually don't bother me, I really don't think that's the biggest problem I'm having. They don't really pull me out of it (though the monster in Zygons tested me royally!), it's more the lackluster performances from the guest stars I think. And also some of the shoddy dialog. 

Actually, you know what, it just hit me. I think the pacing is what I'm struggling with most. Three cliffhangers per serial is grating, and every one of these serials thus far could have easily been wrapped up in less time. I imagine that's just a symptom of how television was in general back then though. They had less faith in an audience's ability to keep up with fast-paced storylines employing multiple layers I guess.

You can buy this great story at the Big Finish website. I'm sorry that their layout is so confusing.

EDIT: On another website, Noah Soudrette says:

    A stunningly ambitious story from Jim Mortimore that has more twists than a twizler. This is 
    Doctor Who/1984 with a dash of insanity thrown in. There are many thematical layers here 
    (reincarnation, identity, etc). It's too much to cover in a small paragraph. Try it for yourself.

And in another's words- advice about listening:

This politically-charged, high-tension story pits the Doctor against his own ideals. It's set in a world where linear time doesn't exist, so the story unfolds backward and forward at once, demanding a highly attentive listener. And the constant stream of revelations means that every time you think you've arrived at an understanding, you realize that everything that came before may have been a smokescreen.

The structural density of this story doesn't permit casual or flippant listening. Having your thumb on the rewind button may be to your advantage. This is a tough one to wrap your brain around, though the experience is certainly worth it to any dedicated fan of the recent, thematically poignant Doctor Who.

You're stuggling with the pacing in the Baker era? What did you think of Hartnell? The early serials never seemed to use four episodes when they could drag it out to six of seven...

http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/6521

Here in Canada, peerages were removed many years ago, but they have a long history in our country. Many, many Canadian Prime Ministers and Governor Generals have been either Knights or Lords. I frankly thought it was a bad idea to take peerages away because it�s amazing what a person will do nowadays to gain a Knighthood. They are often �bought� these days in the U.K. by performing some great act of charity, such as donating huge amounts of money to Libraries or Museums. If someone were to donate a couple of million dollars to the local Library, I certainly wouldn�t have a problem referring to them as �Sir John Doe� for the rest of their lives!

However, as a member of the Commonwealth, it is generally accepted that if you meet someone with a Peerage, you do respect the title and rank accordingly. I once had the �Lord of Great Ellington Hall� of Norfolk England as a Reviewing Officer at my Regimental Review, and we referred to him as �Your Lordship� for the event.

In the U.K, however, Peerages are very important, very traditional to the average person. They often tend to hold on to their titles very jealously and like to be called by their titles.

In terms of reclaiming a Title held by an ancestor, that can be VERY tricky to not only prove, but to get recognized.

If the title your ancestor received was in fact Hereditary and not many outside the Royal Family are anymore. In fact, when the Duke of Edinbrough dies, the title actually dies with him, but HRH Prince Edward will be �recreated� as the Duke of Edinbrough. If the title was indeed hereditary, then you must be able to prove it with a �Letter of Patent�. Such documentation is USUALLY held by the family of a Duke/Lord etc and passed to each successive eldest son.

If you do not have such documentation, you can ask the Heraldry Council in the U.K. (Or equivalent organization in whatever country you are seeking to regain your family title) to find it for you. However, such an endeavor will no doubt prove extremely expensive and may not yield any results at all. But, if the Council does in fact come up with something, they will either recognize the Title and give you your documentation (In which case you are �officially� a Lord/Lady/Duke/Duchess/Whatever) or they will declare the title dead and you are out of luck.

You need to be very careful when making such claims however, as there have always been organizations out there willing to �sell� you titles, which have no real basis to be recognized by legitimate holders of such titles. These companies were big business in the 70�s and have recently begun to surface again. They usually pull a scam such as offering to sell you one square foot of land in the U.K. and tack on a title to that land, such as �Holland House� and tell you that you may then refer to yourself as �Lord Holland� �Lord of Holland House� or other such. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from doing so, but it isn�t exactly recognized by the Heraldry Council, and therefore, (IMHO) not a Peerage Title.

So start with the Heraldry Council and find out if the expense, time and trouble are worth it for you.

true,baantacron,null,null,"American here, I follow two teams, Liverpool and Barcelona. So whenever I see Liverpool get a poor result despite possession I look at Barcelona to see what they're doing with their large amount of possession. From what I can see and conclude, the issue isn't that Liverpool as a whole is playing ""the wrong style"", but rather that the midfield and strikers are playing two different styles.

While the midfield passes the ball around continuously the forwards are acting like the team is gonna give them a long ball over the top. This is obviously not working. Suarez and Kuyt at doing an alright job at making themselves available, but then whenever they're in a position to do damage, nobody else is there to finish off their rebounds or clever little passes inside the box. Also their far to rarely on the field at the same time, so there's only like one person making a run into the box at a time. This allows the opponents back four to just crowd out whoever is making the run. This lack of room that the forwards create then frustrate attacking midfielders who then just make ridiculous strikes from outside the 18 yard box (I'm looking at you Adam).

I know it's a bit unfair to compare the current Liverpool squad to the current Barcelona squad, but the principals of attacking with possession remain similar if not the same. I think Liverpool needs to make up its mind as to whether it wants to maintain possession and press into the box with teamwork. And once they make up their minds about that, they needs to get their forwards working together to make room for the midfielders to link up with them.

Oh yeah, also if they could finish the chances they're given, that'd be awesome (CARROLL!!).

true,Whaleofatime99,lfc68,,"To be honest I think the players are being told too many things with regards to position. We can keep the ball but we do very little with it, we are not a creative side. Our full backs usually stop at the edge of the box instead of surging into and pull the opposition wide. This is the same as our wide men who just play crosses in from afar which most defenders love. Enrique, Johnson and Kelly are all capable of surging runs into the box yet they do it rarely in games, I would like the full backs to have one aim and that is to get into the box. Secondly our forwards have to be in the box!! something that rarely happens. Another point I would like to add to that is our players are not that in sync with one another. Why our wide men do not take players on is a mystery and I am sure they are told to play the ball early. Many people criticize downing but I think he could easily dribble himself into the box.

The midfield is too slow and predictable. We play safe football and I pray we get a creative midfielder from abroad during the summer. Fast balls should be played out wide and through the middle constantly, and we should switch the ball more. Attack attack on the left with a quick switch to the right to spread them, that's when a full back should overlap the wide man to spread them even more and hard ball on the ground into the box for someone to tap in.

And if they donate 500k anyway but some of it now goes to the government rather than the charity then surely that means that the government can spend it on what it judged (democratically in theory) to be the most important problems.

Don't forget that there are charitable donations to private ballet schools and modern art collectives etc. which aren't terribly important as well as for saving blind children. And that the Government can use revenue to fund free school meals and reducing the deficit as well as funding Trident and wars and QE etc.

I just don't see why this policy is so obviously bad.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"My ""obsession"" over the shallow superficiality of making the Doctor a woman is because such a change at such a time would be purely anatomical. If the Doctor continues to behave the way he always has then it's just slapping new body parts on him and calling it a day, it's a totally superficial change. It's like suddenly making the TARDIS green because you've fixed the Chameleon Circuit, it's a purely aesthetic change, but now people are going to ask ""why change it at all?"". 

And I am not saying they should make the Doctor act femininely (I would think one would understand that when I call such course of action ""sexist""), but I'm not so idealistic to preclude such a possibility from occurring. The current showrunner is not that great at portraying women as anything but sexy, feisty, flirty gun-toters.

Even if we were to get a writer who would write a brilliant female Doctor and then if we were to get a brilliant director to lead the actress we still would never be able to have that same brilliant combination in every episode. Eventually we'd get some godawful combination that pumps out sexist works. Your pessimism in the media's views of gender should at least warn you of that much.

I understand that ""gender neutral"" does not equal male. I don't think you've really been ruminating on what I've been saying. The Doctor is mostly gender neutral, but it's not because he's male but rather in spite of it. This would be the case if he was written exactly the same, but had been female for the past fifty years.

What you are talking about is taking a character whose gender has *never* come up as a major element in the show and suddenly tearing it from the unnoticed background and throwing it into the limelight with a sudden and unnecessary change.

And that's what I'm getting at. It's not a Male to female change that's the issue. It's the idea of changing the gender *at all* that makes no sense. The idea of taking a longstanding character (be they male or female) and changing the gender for no reason other than ""because we can"".

The Doctor's *not about* gender, and yet by making a change, that's what people are going to be noticing. If the Doctor had been female for fifty years and was suddenly played by a man people would be feeling just as confused and bewildered at the sudden stunt as if it were the reverse. I reiterate: it's not about a male to female shift, it's the fact that  there is a shift and this shift is pointless and unwarranted.

And yes, Helen Mirren is a brilliant actress, although I really didn't care for the latest remake of the Tempest that much (nothing to do with her performance, which was superb, but more to do with the generic big-budget aura it carried with it that seemed to miss a lot of the depth of the source to me).",0,1333900257,null,0,false,0,c49u7u2,t3_ry424,t1_c49u7u2,t1_c49qbwz,null,1428679021,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Moffat wrote more for the demographic than RTD did. (Quick side note...The demographic are families...not just children). RTD was more soapy and soaps are not exactly aimed at children. 

Moffat also puts more effort into his storylines. Sure, they may not be fantastic...but they are better than those seasons with RTD where all he had to do was stick a line in each episode, anywhere he wanted whether it makes sense or not, and answer it at the end with a quick swipe of a hand.

I know that Cole was asking for more money than he was probably worth (100k wages), but he was forced out for an inferior player who contributed little to nothing to the squad, as much as I like Benayoun as a player/person.

Cole was also as much of a warrior for the club as Lamps or Terry or any of the other star players at the time. His dismissal came at a really bad time... I don't think it is a coincidence that we have been struggling with poor, non-creative wingers since he left the squad.

&gt;The officer involved with Tomlinson is to face trial for it.

Yes, but you can't deny that the image of the police suffered as a result of the incident, particularly when it transpired that [important evidence was initially withheld from the IPCC.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/may/09/ian-tomlinson-evidence-held-back?intcmp=239)

&gt;The current racism thing is vastly blown out of all proportion...One person made those comments.

Well done on ignoring numerous other factors including the [2009 report which ""concluded that the police remain institutionally racist.""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/15/police-racism) and the [buried 2004 report which warned that the Met Police needed to stop discriminating against black people](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/06/metropolitan-police-warned-racism).

The feelings of mistrust towards the police are growing, fanned by the media who do love a juicy story. But it's disingenous to try and claim that this is purely media spin and that there aren't genuine problems within the police service.

My personal experiences with the police have always been positive, but much work is needed for them to change their image because at the moment I don't think it's been lower.

As I said at the beginning of my last post, I am sympathetic to the police. Hell, I'm a public sector employee, so I know exactly what it's like to be demonised in the press as a lazy, non-job fatcat with a 'gold plated pension', who is sucking all the wealth out of the UK.

So please don't read my comment as being anti-police; I'm merely trying to highlight that there are some negative behaviours within the police service which need to be clearly and publicly dealt with in order to restore faith and allow the vast majority of decent officers to get on with their job, to the best of their available resources.",0,1333903221,null,0,false,0,c49uoam,t3_rx226,t1_c49uoam,t1_c49t3nb,null,1428679314,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You do realise that's a tradition in Doctor Who, right? Bubble wrap and plastic bottles are the staples for classic Who costumes.

I'm not going to disregard your arguments, even though you provide no examples or any sort of supporting evidence, but declaring his characters ""the worst in the whole of the franchise"" smacks of ignorance.

Moffat (and RTD) cannot claim ownership over *every* character in their tenure on the show. They wrote a handful of episodes each, and, frankly if you're desperate to compare them, Moffat's characters during RTD's time are consistently hailed as the best. These include: Captain Jack, Madame de Pompadour, Sally Sparrow and River Song (although that last one is debateable it depends who you speak to).

He can let a pass go astray, but he runs like a horse, is strong as an ox, and can shoot like a Monster (ran out of animals).

 I don't think theres any shame in parking the bus against another team. UNLESS you are the bigger team. Parking the bus means that you accept that the opposition team is better at attacking than you are. If we played City or United etc, and THEY parked the bus - its shameful. This really isn't anything new. We've been getting this a lot this season, but have just been able to unlock the opposition defense somehow.

How is this different from defence spending?

IE: You have no right to take the wealth of others to protect your backyard. If you do not invest your money and work hard to buy your own tank and jet fighter. What right do you have to coerce me to pay taxes to fund your defence. 

Answer: Defence is much more effective and efficient when the cost is spread. And we all suffer if the country is weakened due to some members being unable to protect their borders.

The same is true of healthcare. The economy needs a healthy and happy workforce. If healthcare is only available to the wealthy. Then the cost of keeping a healthy workforce forces companies to spend moreon normally low paid jobs. 

Funding healthcare at a higher level (IE national or poss state) is much more efficient and cheaper. Reducing the cost of the workforce over all. Helping the econ. 

Edit: When you consider that the UK set up its NHS very soon after the 2nd world war. When we were in some of our worst debt, and had a serious shortage of healthy labour due to the war. The argument made a huge amount of sense.  ",0,1333910467,null,0,true,0,c49vwe4,t3_rxybi,t1_c49vwe4,t1_c49v9pv,null,1428679881,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

For my money, he definitely has solid defensive positioning, though there's kind of the illusion that he doesn't because he's often so far forward that it seems like desperate recovery.

It really is similar to watching Alves defend. They rely on their athleticism more than anything else, but who cares? It's just as effective, and often moreso because opponents get excited thinking they're away only to be run down. Walker's positioning on crosses and shit is also typically exemplary. 2-3 times against Sunderland he dealt with incredibly good crosses towards the back stick. I think he's much better than BAE in that regard. He has higher concentration. 

As for dribbling, no. He can kick the ball into space and outrun people, but he is not a technically gifted player. He does useless stepovers, waits too long to cross, and the cross is usually shit.

true,aureolin_,null,null,"I never said the writers would change the Doctor's gender now.  I know they wouldn't.  That's not what I'm arguing about, and no this view isn't pessimistic.  My point this whole time.  You've continued to talk past it, and bring up irrelevant information like analogies that go nowhere and how I chose to make that point.  An argument loses or gains nothing if it is made politely or with swearing and insults.  To believe otherwise is to miss the point entirely, and if you say my argument suffers because if this, that is ad hominem.  You even did this in one of your previous posts.  Remember, ""I don't sownvote often, but since you've decided to insult me *instead of make a point* I'm a bit forced to be doing so. I'm really disappointed. The could have been such an engaging and interesting conversation *had you not decided to just start flinging around insults instead of discussing the point like a mature adult*""?  Emphasis is mine.  That's two logical fallacies so far, one formal and one informal.  Care to add another?  Affirming the consequent is always a classic.  ""Maturity"" and what's ""becoming"" has no bearing on how well an individual can think rationally or how well someone can create valid, sound arguments.  You have not cursed once this whole time, and yet you have not once actually addressed my original point that the Doctor, if he is gender neutral, should have no problem regenerating as a woman.  In theory.  How this is received by the audience, whether it is interpreted as a ""jumping the shark"" or ""adding tits and a vagina"" for shock value is irrelevant.  If you've forgotten my original point, here it is, ""If the Doctor is 'not portrayed with a specific gender in mind', there would be nothing wrong or even remotely surprising if he regenerated as a woman. The fact that you maintain that the Doctor must never be a woman makes his gender not only obviously there but necessary to his character, and even if he has never been a stereotypical manly man, he is still a man and must continue be so according to you.""

If it is the case that the Doctor would be made less gender neutral by regenerating as a woman, which is the correct way to argue against my point, why?  I have already stated why it wouldn't be the case that he'd become less gender neutral.  If a character that can and does regenerate is always the same gender, this draws attention to the fact that they have not regenerated as another gender.  ""Oh, the Doctor was not written as a man?  Why has he always regenerated as a man, if this is the case?""  This never happens with human characters, for obvious reasons; they never regenerate.  Though, considering you now seem to be agreeing with me, ""you theoretically might be able to"", there's really no need for this discussion to continue.

The problem with your analogy about furniture is that you compared the Doctor regenerating as a woman to something completely unprecedented and pointless.  I have already explained that it would be neither of those things.  If you want to understand, just read my posts again.  There isn't any information on how random Time Lord regeneration is, but considering how the Doctor doesn't seem to have any control or at least very little control on how he regenerates.  The writers could very easily have written that their ""gender neutral"" character have a probability of 50% of regenerating as either male or female.  This would negate the problem with it coming as a surprise that the Doctor regenerated as a woman seemingly out of nowhere.  The fact that he has regenerated as male each time would have just been he happened to land on the male side of that 50%.  Of course, I know that there are more genders than male and female, but I don't believe writers on a mainstream network would be making their main character intersex, even though this also would have little impact on anything other than making it clear that the character doesn't have gender written into their character.  That said, I don't even have a problem with characters who do have gender written into their character.  Buffy was never supposed to be gender neutral, considering Joss Whedon wrote her as a subversion to the girl who dies first in horror movies.  I don't know how you got that she was written as gender neutral.  I still loved her character, though.  She was bad ass and felt human even though she was a character, but she was always supposed to be female.  I guess maybe Willow could have been?  It's been a while since I watched the show.  Cordelia definitely wasn't, though.  I've never watched Voyager, so no comment.  I'll give you Firefly, though, especially Zoe.  It's a shame it was canceled after one season because it was a great show, though for reasons completely irrelevant to this, and I'll save that for another rant.  Pointing out three examples, one of which doesn't even count does not negate the fact that *most* characters written without a gender in mind tend to be given to men, and most characters in general tend to be male unless the show/movie/book is targeted at women or girls.  This is why it would almost certainly not actually happen that the Doctor, written without a gender in mind, would regenerate as a woman.  If it did, and his character continued to be written without a gender in mind, I would be very surprised.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I'm not dismissing your points. At no stage did I think that the Doctor couldn't reasonably turn into a woman. Being a gender-neutral character this change is completely possible.

What *I* am saying is that although this action certainly *could* be done, it's a needless and superficial change that really serves no purpose other than to jump the shark.

My point is not that it can't be done, as obvious it can. My point is that it *shouldn't* be done, because it serves no other purpose other than tossing the issue of gender into the foreground when that has never been what Doctor Who's about. It only serves to derail the character through a pointless change. Not that his character would change, but in that the action of changing genders provides a needless and unwarranted distraction from the actual character him/herself.

The Doctor is gender neutral in the sense that you are supposed to forget about his gender. You're supposed to not really think about it. And although he *could* turn into a woman, doing so makes you suddenly think about his/her gender. Not because he is now *a woman* but because he has suddenly changed genders, something that has *never* happened before over the course of fifty years.

If you make a sudden and radical change pertaining to the gender the audience *must* take note, further distracting and sapping away precious screentime of character development to address what is a wholly unneeded and superficial change.

And stepping into the logistics of regeneration, we have no guarantee that that this is possible for the Doctor. All we know of is *one* Time Lord who altered gender. Seeing as the Doctor has gone through eleven consecutive regenerations being male, it would seem foolish to think that it's been a 50-50 odds each time. It's entirely possible if not probable that seeing as the Doctor often has no control over his regenerations, he probably *can't* become female, or at least the change would be very unlikely. 

Perhaps I'm not being specific enough. I'll avoid the usage of ""gender neutral"" and give the more specific description of characters written with no one particular gender in mind or in any other way written without conformity to gender-normative stereotypes.

And again, you devolve into this rambling. It's like somebody reciting the Gettysburg Address and then tossing a fistfull of shit at the audience. It doesn't make their previous actions nullified, but it certainly makes it more difficult to see them as a reasonable and level-headed adult. I really don't like doing it, but insulting another user earns posters downvotes. I'm really sorry that what would normally be a mature and adult conversation has to be marred by you stooping so low just to prove a point that you can and still make a point (although much of your actions makes it quite difficult to believe such as true).",0,1333914102,null,0,false,0,c49wjca,t3_ry424,t1_c49wjca,t1_c49wbew,null,1428680184,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

At the time I was gutted, a lot of fans were. Watching his tearful farewell interview was actually heart-wrenching, and he was one of the best natural footballers of the Moyes era, so it was quite a blow. A lot of the resentment was levelled at the board, as it was seen that he was being sacrificed to service debt. However, most people aren't angry or resentful towards Mikel himself. 

The main problem was that we lacked a creative outlet until Donovan and Pienaar made their ways back.

One of the major arguments for independence is that the economic governance of Westminster is too right wing for Scotland, but it seems to me inevitable that an independent Scotland's long term interests lie in following the Irish model, and cutting corporation tax to attract multinationals. Clearly Alex Salmond agrees to some extent, as you can see from this comment, as well as:

* Before the crisis he praised Irish economic policy, and talked about an 'arc of prosperity' from Ireland to Iceland.

* (Also before the crisis) he was very keen on RBS expansion, cheering on Fred Goodwin's (as it turns out disastrous) acquisition of ABN AMRO. 

It seems to me that an independent Scotland would define itself against a right wing government in Westminster, while actually enacting economic policies even further to the right, in pursuance of its national interest (which is essentially to act as an offshore English language base for Europe).

There is pretty strong evidence to suggest that cannabis use can be linked to depression and anxiety, and there is also a suggested link between cannabis and more serious mental illnesses (although whether the link is casual or not is unclear). As well as this, even if addiction is not generally physical, psychogical addiction is very real. Anyone who doesn't believe this can happily speak to several friends of mine.

Just to be clear, I'm not anti-cannabis and in fact have gone through phases of smoking it very regularly. I just find that many of these legalisation movements are pretty bias, and often act as if cannabis is this holy herb which is harmless because it's 'impossible to overdose or die from it'.

Personally, even as someone who smokes, I'm not exactly for legalisation. Use did rise when it was downgraded to a class C drug, and considering our country has a fairly big drug culture already, I can't imagine legalisation would help.

No really, like others have said, I'm confidant it was himself. He's the one with the god complex, not just the minotaur. He's been so successful in so much, he inadvertently begins to have faith in his own greatness. But he also knows who he really is, the man who killed the time lords, the daleks, the cybermen; Genocide is tough on the soul, regardless of the race. He's the man who needs rules (good men don't need rules), and the one who needs companions to keep him in check, by his own admission. He's the dream lord, the destroyer of worlds, the oncoming storm, the man who's mere name causes an armada of hostile alien battlecraft to back the fuck up. He's the man that inspired the Pandorica. Imagine that man without limits, without friends, without a sense of right and wrong, and you have someone that would cause the daleks, the  cybermen, and the Master himself all wet themselves and flee to the darkest reaches of the galaxy.

It is not democratic as if a large number of poor people want to support a homeless shelter meanwhile a small number of extremely rich people want to support a modern art collective. Then if it was all done via charity, the modern art collective would flourish and the homeless shelter would fail.

Democracy via the dollar is not democracy.

But to move back to the real world from such extreme hypothetical arguments, there is real evidence that charities are used to avoid tax, IKEA being a famous example where the family sit on the board of various charities owned by the trust, and it is used to shift money around the family without paying any tax. [This is relatively well documented.](http://boingboing.net/2009/08/26/ikea-is-owned-by-a-c.html)

In the face of evidence like this it is clear that to prevent tax evasion/avoidance which is extremely costly to this country, something must be done. This policy seems to be a good pragmatic way to address it.

Second, right now at Fulham he's basically the centerpiece of attack - can he fit in at Chelsea where he won't be the main attraction? He'll be overshadowed by players such as Torres and Mata who have more skill. Even Ramires maybe, who possibly plays a similar way when deployed as a RW (scrappy winger). He probably won't look or play as well as he does at Fulham for that reason - can he still contribute then? Ballack was in the same position after moving from Bayern. He didn't reach the same highs at Chelsea for that reason (in my opinion) but he still contributed a lot.

So, he might be an upgrade over Kalou or Malouda but if we sign a winger this summer (as I think we should) we should target someone better and younger first (Muniain, Hazard come to mind).",0,1333924606,null,0,false,0,c49ybbl,t3_rzqe3,t1_c49ybbl,t3_rzqe3,null,1428681031,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

1. The sample in the 18-24 bracket is far smaller than the other age groups, with a weighted sample of only 211, so it might be wise to take those particular numbers with a larger pinch of salt than the rest.

2. This has been a particularly poor week for the government, particularly on the part of the Conservatives, so the anti-Conservative swing may be slightly exaggerated compared to how it will be in the local elections.

3. Not surprisingly, many 2010 Liberal Democrat voters are planning to move to Labour (38%), or not voting at all (24%), compared with sticking with the party (31%) or moving to their coalition partners (11%). Movements in the opposite direction from the other parties never hit double digits.

4. In Scotland, Labour is beating the SNP by 3 percentage points, a significant turnaround from the last Scottish Parliament general election in 2011, which saw a 14 point SNP lead in the constituency seats and an 18 point SNP lead in the regional seats. However, again notice the small sample size (152 weighted).

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; One of the major arguments for independence is that the economic governance of Westminster is too right wing for Scotland

I think that's a bit simplistic - you can easily have a fiscally conservative administration which has more ""left wing"" social policies.

Either way, you seem to be making the assumption that an independent Scotland would inevitably be an ""SNP Scotland"".

I don't think this is the case: as with any change in government there would be a honeymoon period, a backlash, and then a more measured approach. You can see this play out in any country, under any government, over and over again.

If we assume that independence passes, my prediction is that several of the SNP's current manifesto pledges will be dropped or ignored (as per Labour not raising the top tax rate, the Conservatives cutting the winter fuel allowance, ad infinitum).

Things like corporation tax will probably be put through in the short term to attract investment (nothing wrong with that), but may well have to rise again in the future (also nothing wrong with that: if Scotland decides to enter the eurozone there may well be a requirement to move to a eurozone-wide tax rate as Ireland is being leaned on to adopt).


But I don't know if corporation tax is the kind of thing that really sways voters. The sort of issues I think will have more impact are:

* Should we have nuclear weapons?
* What should we do with the remaining oil/gas?
* What kind of industry should we be developing?
* How will the NHS reforms affect NHS Scotland?
* How sustainable is the Council Tax freeze?
* What is the best role for Scotland in Europe?

None of the above have been mentioned by the parties opposed to independence, who only seem to be concerned with the date. The SNP don't plan to start campaigning until after the local elections/the close of their consultation, which are in May.

Hopefully after that point we will see some more discussion on these kind of topics.

That's the problem with playing what-ifs: you can't speculate that an independent Scotland would be bankrupt because a bank ran up massive debts due to a failure of the UK regulator, because you don't know what the financial regulation in an independent Scotland would have been like.

Hindsight is everything of course, and perhaps we would have - and so would need to go cap in hand to the IMF/Eurozone to ask for a bailout.

true,Dodecac,null,null,"“By international convention, when banks which operate in more than one country get into these sorts of conditions, the bailout is shared in proportion to the area of activities of those banks. In the case of the RBS…roughly speaking 90% of its operations are in England and 10% are in Scotland.”

The Federal Reserve stepped in to bail out US operations linked to RBS and HBOS. In Europe the governments of France, Belgium The Netherlands and Luxembourg joined forces to help the Fortis and Dexia Banks operating across their borders.

George Walker, Professor of International Finance Law at Queen Mary University, London and also Glasgow University, supported this position. So did Andrew Campbell, Professor of international and finance law at Leeds University.

Professor Walker said it was inconceivable that the Treasury would not have stepped in to save RBS’s English operations, even if Scotland was independent. “This decision was not taken to protect either RBS or HBOS, nor specifically the Scottish markets, but to protect the financial stability of the UK financial system as a whole.” he explained.

He went on: “Many of those (RBS) subsidiaries operate out of London and only out of London. I don’t think you can, simply, look at it purely on the basis of where, as you point out, the brass plate of the holding company is.

Professor Campbell said HBOS’s operational head quarters were in Halifax, Yorkshire, so there was even less reason to assume Scots would be responsible for its rescue. But the indisputably Scottish RBS ran up most of its losses in the City of London where it was regulated: “It would be inconceivable that Edinburgh or Scotland as a whole could be held liable for that full bill.”

Moore refused to speak on the programme, so the government’s position was defended by the former Labour chancellor, Alastair Darling. Despite presiding over the meltdown of the UK economy, Darling insisted that he knew better that the professors - or for that matter Sir George Mathewson who used to run RBS and who has made similar comments in the past.

As the facts become understood, the received wisdom about Scotland's banking shame looks as shaky as Darling's economic management. For example, the figure of £450billion is sometimes quoted as the cost of saving the banks. But this completely misleading because it states the banks’ entire liabilities. All banks have more out in lending than they reserve in capital so by this calculation all banks would be technically bankrupt all the time.

The bailout of RBS and HBOS actually cost £66bn in shares and loans. Given that Scottish GDP at the time was £145 billion and our remaining oil reserves, using the American Energy Departments cost calculations, are valued at a trillion pounds, we’d have been well placed to negotiate a good deal on the international money markets – which was how the UK, and other national governments, financed the banking rescue. Indeed given our valuable natural resources, we might have negotiated a better deal. Either way, it would come right in the end. The Office of Budget Responsibility calculate that the Treasury is set to make a profit of £3.4bn on the entire UK bailout, thanks to buying bank shares at the bottom of the market and getting a very attractive rate of return on its loans.

So an independent Scotland could easily have bailed out our banks, but we would not have had to, according to Professors Hughes Hallett, Cambell and Walker.

Having said that, the argument has always struck me as bizarrely hypothetical. How long would this independent Scotland have been in existence before the financial crisis? Long enough to accumulate the same oil fund as Norway? Long enough to swallow the billions of pounds worth of tax on the profits of RBS and HBOS (for if we are responsible for the bailout it follows that we must surely have been due the taxes on profits?) Long enough to establish an effective banking regulation system of our own, perhaps on the advice of our Nordic neighbours who rescued their own banks in the early 1990s?

&gt; That's the problem with playing what-ifs: you can't speculate that an independent Scotland would be bankrupt because a bank ran up massive debts due to a failure of the UK regulator, because you don't know what the financial regulation in an independent Scotland would have been like.

Perhaps an SNP administration would have stepped in to stop the ABN AMRO acquisition? Or perhaps not: *A letter, released yesterday, shows that Salmond wrote to RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin (pictured) in May 2007 to throw his weight behind the bank’s disastrous purchase. Signing the note, “Yours for Scotland”, Salmond said he “would like to offer any assistance my office can provide”. Scotland’s secretary for finance, John Swinney, said in a separate letter at the time that the deal was “an enormous achievement for RBS” that helped make Scotland seem “an attractive place to do business”.*

And with Alex Salmond praising Irish economic policy, built on deregulation and lowered taxes? I think you can say with almost total certainty that the situation would have been the same.

A fundamental characteristic is the fact that he's male. 

We all may know a lot of people they are not male and can pull off the The Doctor. But the television producing world is not like the real world, when a writer builds a female character, the characteristics are always fundamentally different to when a writer builds a male character. 

The Corsair isn't a valid example, I'm not denying that Time Lords can regenerate into a different sex, but The Corsair was a throwaway character to lure The Doctor to House's planet, the introduction of him in that episode in no way altered the formula of the show, the line saying he had been a woman a couple of times was no doubt a throwaway one for fans.

Besides, rule 1. The Doctor lies. 

Beyond that, we know nothing of Time Lord physiology, there may be some gene that controls whether a Time Lord stays the same gender/species when he regenerates, The Doctor has this gene, The Corsair doesn't. 

The Doctor has been a man for nearly 50 years, the male protagonist is a core part of the show, if you changed it it would ruin Doctor Who.

Although I'd rather Scotland remained part of the UK, I'm not massively opposed to it, and I can appreciate that I would possibly be in favour if the shoe was on the other foot. But, also, it is pretty clear that a large part of the support for the SNP and for independence is due to a visceral hatred of the Tory economic legacy in Scotland, which was itself, in turn, built on the economic benefits of deregulation and the lowering of taxes. It seems rather hypocritical for the SNP to on the one hand use that legacy to justify independence, and on the other propose policies which are based on the same principles.

&gt; Either way, you seem to be making the assumption that an independent Scotland would inevitably be an ""SNP Scotland"".

&gt; I don't think this is the case: as with any change in government there would be a honeymoon period, a backlash, and then a more measured approach. You can see this play out in any country, under any government, over and over again.

I think you're also making an assumption that you will see a period of disruption followed by normalization. In Ireland, Fianna Fail has ruled for 61 of the last 79 years, with the next largest party being Fine Gael, who occupy more or less the same ground on economic and social policy. Politics in Ireland are still defined by nationalism, not political/economic ideology. And parties are consistently centre-right, even though most Irish people seem to view themselves as being to the left of Britain.

Unfortunately we (Scotland, the UK, Europe, and indeed most of the western world) have got ourselves into the situation where it's clear that something went wrong but there isn't one Nick Leeson to conveniently pin it on.

The people working in banking did what they do (use money to 'create' money), and politicians did what they do (say ""you have my full support"" when things go well, and ""it was all the other guy's fault"" when they dont).

Entropy Theory does not conflict with Multiple-Worlds quantum theory (sorry, should've been more clear that that's what I meant by Quantum Theory), it's simply an interesting theory on the origin and role of time and space, mainly saying that the universe is (in a simple metaphor) like a non-living organism that exists in order to create perfect conditions (mostly entropy level) for another universe to spawn within it, then collapse (for lack of a better word) fuelling that universe.  

It's still possible that multiple worlds are spawned by the sheer chaos of the potential outcomes of a situation, and this could be used as an explanation *for* entropy (the number of outcomes can be so greatly different that entirely new worlds could be created depending on the heads or tails of a coin flip, I just don't think that both happen).  The basic creation method is that eventually black holes create a zone of such entire entropy that it would not be observable if it were either a universe for a little while or nothingness, and then the universe might be the one that happens, and life forms might exist, like us.

Maybe not so much now, but you're hypothesing that Scotland went independent 10 years ago so we wouldn't have the same fall out from the Blair/Brown years and Nick Clegg &amp; co's betrayal of those who elected them in 2010. Also we had a Lab/LD coalition for 8 years up here and I think they did a reasonable job, its the the Westminster branches of those parties and Labour's miserable performance in opposition to the SNP since 2007 that has discredited them in Scotland. So if independence had happened around the time of the early 2000's (as this argument depends on) these parties, especially the Lib Dems would have retained a certain amount of credibility, so I doubt there would be the same amount of scrabbling in the dirt as would happen if there is a yes vote in 2014.

After only one encounter with The Doctor, he did research and was one of the few people to understand how the TARDIS worked in concept, taking away The Doctor's fun when people say it's bigger on the inside. Even back before he lived 2000 years, he was steadily increasing in bravery. He was investigating the coma patients, he wasn't bothered too much by the impending end of the world, and he fought a vampire in a swordfight, and saved Amy from mutant old people at the cost of his own life, while standing up to The Doctor the whole episode. Not to mention that he kept his head against the Silurians, even as the lizard chick was threatening to murder the fuck out of everything on the surface. He also punched out The Doctor.
He's also worked on The TARDIS with The Doctor, although he did accidentally almost kill them all. But really, it was Amy's fault.

Well, Amy's skirt and the Doctor's glass floors.

After spending all his time watching over the Pandorica (which did get erased from history), he's kept a starliner from crashing,comforted his wife when The Doctor died (and gave him a bitching Viking funeral), kept on the run from the US government in the 1960s and faked his own death in front of several FBI agents, fought pirates without fear, tried to talk some sense into The Flesh, helped The Doctor take down the Cyber Legion and find out where his wife was, fought at the Battle of Demon's Run where he captured Madam Kovarian, fought the Headless Monks and still tended to Strax, punched out Hitler (damn, Rory has a nice hook) and rode a motorcycle because ""it's been that kind of a day"", ran through the corridors of the TARDIS and alternate time shenanigans aside, made sure Amy was safe, and stalled House. He was the only one in The God Complex who didn't rely on an external force for comfort or reassurances, and kept his head during the whole ordeal, even capturing the Minotaur.

true,kasparu,null,null,"There is no connection between the midfield and the forwards, I would like to see more fluidity between the midfield and forwards, I want to see the midfield exploded and make runs or support the forwards instead of just hoofing the ball up pitch and hoping for the best. There is no purpose at all in our game, it's so uninspiring to look at, nothing is going on, nobody do anything unexpected, there is no spark, always the same runs over and over and over. Stoke is more exiting to watch (I'm not kidding, I would rather watch Stoke play). 

We also need more cutting inside with the wingers. Enrique and Downing is especially bad in this regard, I rarely see Downing or Enrique making a run trying to get into the box or beat defenders, which I think is weird since I think Downing has the ability and Enrique the strength to catch many defenders by surprise.

This is how we play 98% of the time. Defence deliver ball to either 1) central midfield or 2) wing backs or wingers. If 1) the central midfield will play around with the ball without purpose, then hoof it up field to Suarez or Carroll who will try to play 1-2 tiki-taka and produce a miracle with 6 defenders on their backs and without support from the midfield. If 2) the wing backs or wingers will run up field until they can touch one of the oppositions corner flags and then make a bad cross with nobody in the box. This is how we play over and over again, week in and week out. Bellamy have been the only breeze of fresh air because he is the only one who do unexpected things. Everyone else have no teeth and it's either because Kenny is stuck in the past where a football match was won by hoofing the ball forward enough times hoping for a lucky bounce or a defender error or else it's the players not giving a shit. First I though it was the players not working hard enough or needing time to settle, now I'm beginning to think that it's just Kenny's tactics being uninspiring and one-dimensional.

true,cock_blockula,null,null,"&gt;This question of unionist parties post-independence is actually quite interesting in its own right. Do you think the non-SNP parties would continue partially in parallel with Westminster parties, actually to the extent of maintaining the same names?

It's hard to say although [one of the candidates for the Scottish conservative leadership last year proposed a creating a new party](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15145478) due to their negative image amongst Scots. I don't think Labour or the Lib Dems would do anything so drastic, but they would have to spend a bit of time trying to rebuild their past reputations as left wing progressive parties. They would probably benefit from cutting official ties with their Westminster branches, something which would be inevitable in an independent Scotland.

&gt; I stand by the inevitability of repeated post independence SNP majorities

Personally I wouldn't be so confident of this, the SNP don't be fooled by their majority, SNP don't enjoy the same kind of engrained/hardcore support that Labour enjoyed. The SNP have earned their majority (from good governance in a minority coalition with the greens and progressive policies), but their election wins relied just as much, if not more on stealing disenfranchised Labour (particularly from the Central Belt) and Lib Dem voters than it did on its traditional bases (Highlands and Islands, North-East). Basically my point is people are less likely to stick by them if they fuck up, unlike they did with Labour (although that is more in Westminster elections).",0,1333935467,null,0,false,0,c4a0a70,t3_rzo0n,t1_c4a0a70,t1_c49zxm1,null,1428681977,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You also know that he has a time machine and can probably save you before you even get lost, so you expect maybe a week of roughing it out, seeing as he can pick you up *at any time*.

So you wait.

And wait.

And wait.

And each year you wonder to yourself ""why?"". Why not now? Why would he keep me waiting like this?

And so you forget about them. You life a miserable life alone, wallowing in your insanity and just barely staying alive each day.

You watch yourself age and you lose more and more of your life.

You now know that you will die here, on a planet you don't know of in a room you were never meant to be in.

You would be on Earth living your life, having children, being able to enjoy the years that are being slowly stolen from you and replaced with years in hell.

And then, and *only then* do they come to save you. And when they do, the Doctor doesn't want *you*. He's going to erase you from existance. No, they want *young* you.

All of those years, all of that struggle, all of that time. Gone. For nothing. They never have to live with the consequences while you suffer all those decades.

Remember that Amy thinks that Rory doesn't remember anything. He tries to hide that he kept all the memories. So to her it was just Auton Rory that spent all that time and Rory didn't experience a second of it. But Rory's not even who she's mad at.

She's mad at the Doctor, the coward who now chooses to hide in his TARDIS while the rest of you fight for your lives. The man who always leaves before he has to take any responsibility for what he's done. The man who gives promises instead of goodbyes, promises he never keeps. The Doctor: the liar.

I assume you mean ""In a perfect relationship a girl should not be made to choose between her man and her cuttlefish"", but you've made a few mistakes (or whoever made this made a few mistakes.

The curve for the ""d"" in ""and"" is too shallow and is an ""r"". It must be greater than a half-circle's width inwards to be ""d"".

There is no ""i"" in this sentence's ""f"" in the word ""kuttlefish"". This is an easy fix.

The curve in ""ber"" representing ""b"" requires two extended lines to make it into an ""h"".

In the ""jt"" meant to be ""to"" there is an enormous circle in it's middle for no reason. This makes it appear as if there is a ""j"". It should also be rotated so the shallow indent representing ""t"" is facing further downwards so it is the first letter read.

The new guys are very young and inexperienced and that is why we need to probably pay a lot to get guys into key positions ie left and right wings. If we keep getting players that are talented while they are younger and cheaper it can only be good for us in the future.

Undoubtedly this is the ideal situation but if the players are not ready for it, then we're not left with much choice. Are you curious about the youth team in general ([found here](http://www.chelseafc.com/page/ReservesProfilesIndex/0,,10268,00.html) and [here](http://www.chelseafc.com/page/AcademyProfilesIndex/0,,10268,00.html)) or something more? 

Our transfer policy seems to be favouring slightly proven youth - Sturridge, Ramires, David Luiz, Mata, Romeu, KDB are examples.

Either we stick with Ivan at RB and bring in a new CB, or move him back to CB and bring in a new RB. I think RDM is the coach to finally lose faith with Bosingwa and hopefully we'll see him leave this year. I'd like to see a new RB come in as well, although I want one that is solid at defending - I have my doubts about Maicon/Alves. I'd like another Cole or Philip Lahm type.

And my problem isn't that the Doctor doesn't take things seriously, because he always does (usually), and faking nonchalance is a ""thing"" (Girl in the Fireplace). My problem is that 4 was seldom taking a moral high ground or truly outraged to the core. You get a bit of that in the Pirate Planet and sometimes he points out the sheer *wrongness* of things (Where does the money go?), but it never seems to apply to him personally. It feels like games to him- sure games that he deeply cares about winning, especially when his life is in danger, but games nonetheless. Same kind of thing could be said for 7, but in a different sense.

This isn't really that big of a problem for me, but it's there, buried, subtle, and hidden. *Something* about the 4th Doctor is a bit off putting and it's not his un-relatableness or his eccentric tendencies.",0,1333941610,null,0,false,0,c4a1hqc,t3_rzyum,t1_c4a1hqc,t1_c4a12rz,null,1428682526,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Have to agree with Ignibus. The show is unique for its tendency to change *everything*. Main cast, writers, directors, producers, sets...

Will advise you to avoid getting trapped in Whovian ""elitism"" in which you're not a ""true"" fan if you don't watch/try classic or something. There's a difference between a ""true"" fan and a ""big"" fan. Everyone can be a true fan, but not everybody is a big fan.

Mindset: know that while it's classified as sci-fi, Doctor Who's format allows it to be anything- horror, humor, adventure, mystery. For this reason, there will be episodes/eras that you hate and others that you love. It goes up and down the scale of ""sci-fi hardness"" sometimes using actual physics and other times totally contradicting itself and saying ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey"".

The show is nearly 50 years old, so the continuity is a mess. Also, unlike Star Wars or Star Trek, Doctor Who has no official canon as declared by the BBC or any other head writers/actors. This is pretty controversial here- people will claw your eyes out arguing about canon. Or in Reddit's case, downvote you into oblivion.

The special effects vary. In 2010+ they're pretty good, in 2005-09 they're pretty good but a little more camp, and in the classic series they use every sci-fi sfx stereotype ever. Rubber suits, ships on strings, bubblewrap...

But one great thing is that the show consequently never relies on special effects to tell a good story.

Thibaut Courtois (GK), Tomas Kalas (CB), Jeffrey Bruma (CB), Nathaniel Chalobah (CB), Nathan Ake (CB), Sam Hutchinson (CB/RB), Ben Gordon (LB), Patrick van Aanholt (LB), Conor Clifford (CM), Lucas Piazon (CAM), Kevin De Bruyne (LW/CAM), Gaël Kakuta (LW/CAM),  Islam Feruz (CF), Patrick Bamford (CF)

Courtois, Piazon, KDB, Kakuta, Feruz and Bamford are particularly promising. Bruma, PVA, Chalobah have looked pretty good and Hutchinson is a fan favourite as he was able to come back from early retirement (knee injury).

Mikel is a difficult player to assess because he plays a naturally quiet game. He has gone under-appreciated around here for a long time but it's starting to turn around. He plays a simple game: strong tackles, tidy passes. Nothing really fancy, not a lot of pace or forward passes even, but he's dependable and allows the fullbacks (and David Luiz at times) to get forward with confidence. The type of player that you notice more when he's not there or not doing his job.

My buys for the summer: right back. Azpilicueta of Marseille or Gregory van der Wiel of Ajax are currently the in vogue young right backs. I haven't heard much about their defending though, I'm more concerned with adding a solid defender than an attacking fullback. I hear Nathaniel Clyne of Crystal Palace is young and promising as well.

Adding a right back will allow Ivanovic to provide cover for the RB/CB positions, which I think will be necessary given Terry's increasing injury proneness. I would sell Bosingwa but hold on to Ferreira, in case the new RB falters and we have a CB or two hurt.

I would also like to add wingers; I think Modric is unnecessary as Mata is a better player. With some proper wingers we should be able to play him as a CAM full-time. Give trials to Kakuta, KDB, McEachran and Piazon to see where their progress is, hopefully one or two of them can stay with the first team and provide cover. Probably too early to sell Kalou, but I think Malouda's time is done. Bring in one world-class winger and another one who's more for cover. Ensure they're comfortable playing on the right as we lack options on that side. I like Muniain of Athletic Bilbao as he's young and talented. Eden Hazard of Lille will be in-demand, with good reason - may as well put a bid or two in for him.

""Horizon"" is a bit hit and miss, but before about 2000, it was *brilliant*. It seems to have been dumbed down a little since. ""How it Works"" is new, and I've only just watched two episodes on BBC4 about how metals work (""Metal:How it works""), this is going to be followed by ""Plastic:How it works"" and presumably a bunch of other stuff. 

""Cracker"" with Robbie Coltraine I really enjoyed, although it might be considered a bit dated now, along with ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", (and it's sequel ""Smileys People"") which was made in the 70s. ""The Devils Whore"" is a drama set during the English Civil War, a war most Americans know very little about, which I find astonishing since it fed so much of American Revolutionary thought 100 years later.  ""Rome"" was *brilliant* over two series, and I can't believe they did only 2 series, it had absolutely everything going for it. Similarly, ""The Tudors"" could have kept going after Henry's death in the last series with Mary and then Elizabeth, but no sign of that happening yet. I suspect most people here will turn their noses up at ""Downton Abbey"", but it is very popular.

Once your car is working, you need to buy 6-month of tax for it (removing the SORN), and then MOT it, which is an annual test for cars older than three years. If it's an old car, the MOT is likely to have expired, so make sure that you phone ahead and book the car into a garage before setting off. An MOT just tests things that effect other people, so your brakes, lights, emissions, tyres, etc. (not your engine, clutch, oil levels, etc.).

My point is/was that you were bringing up an issue by using a quote from this story that didn't support your point.

&gt; This is the problem with people like you.

Chris on a bike, you do like to read what you *want* to, rather than what is there, don't you?

Have I made any point countering the actual issue you were raising? No.    
Have I said you were plain wrong? No.    
Have I said ""Hang on, you can't get to that conclusion from the quotation used""? Yes!

I haven't expressly agreed or disagreed with you, but rather pointed out that you're making points that can't be extrapolated from the quote you used. But I even said this! :

&gt; So far as I can tell you're making certain points that can't be drawn from this particular story. **And that says nothing against their validity, btw.**

Was that not clear? In this case: ""their validity"" refers to the validity of the points you are making. Or perhaps you didn't read that far. But either way perhaps I should make it clearer for someone seemingly hell bent on dismissing someone who hasn't openly agreed with them 100%:

""While I make no judgement one way or the other on what you have said, I am simply pointing out that in this case your chosen quote does not support the point you are trying to make. As such I think it is erroneous to use the sentence you have to then imply that people are leeching: The whole point of the sentence was demonstrating that these families can't feed themselves because/and they are not entitled to work or benefits.""

Clear? Are we sorted? Or are you going to continue to insist that I'm a raging lefty? Maybe it's enough for you that I haven't blindly supported your argument, even though it was made using an erroneous quotation.

&gt;  You don't see that we have a problem with immigrants and our benefit system directly due to EU policy and because of that it makes the problem worse.

Point to anything I've said that expressly makes this clear - that this is my opinion. You won't find it because I haven't made my thoughts clear one way or the other. Well actually you might pull out some random sentence and decide that's what I've said.

Plus I think the cheapest 'new' car is ...£2,000? ([google tells me the cheapest car in the UK is £1,390](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/motoring/article-1164150/1-390-worlds-cheapest-car-headed-Britain.html)) It's definitely more than many people could 'afford' easily.

So the SNP should be able to use their majority for at least 3 years, and unless there were mass resignations after an unsuccessful referendum they would still have a majority for a further 2 years.

The referendum probably isn't going to be as black-and-white as your friend suggests, since it looks likely that a ""devo-max"" question will be included as well (Salmond is being careful to not explicitly state he is for this, and although some SNP members are opposed to it I suspect he does want it on there).

If that was included then the referendum essentially becomes:

* Should Scotland become independent?
* Should Scotland have further devolution?

Devolution is widely seen as a positive thing here, and totally mainstream, so I think that even people who vote no to the first will vote yes to the second. So even if the first question failed both pro- and anti- sides will be able to claim victory.

iMO Salmond is playing the long game: now seems as good a time as any to make a pitch for independence, but if that doesn't pass then further devolution means this question is going to be revisited.

The atmosphere towards independence is much more positive now than it was in 1979, and back then there was 51.6% voting yes. This was counted as an overall no, since Labour introduced a requirement that a yes vote must also exceed 40% of the total registered electorate rather than just a majority of the votes cast (and the yes votes were 32.9% of the registered electorate).",0,1333967287,null,0,true,0,c4a4i36,t3_rzo0n,t1_c4a4i36,t1_c49zqef,null,1428684009,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

What is does say is:

and

&gt;The think thank says that if bank holidays were scrapped, Britain's gross domestic product (GDP) - a measure of the value of goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - would be £19bn higher every year.

Note, that last statement in no way suggests that the think tank recommend scrapping bank holidays, it's purely a statement as to how much they are estimated to cost.

There may be ""de jure"" (legal) rules preventing discrimination on the basis of age, and there may be ""de facto"" (in fact) rules.  Those rules may be different.

The test is to see if there are any consequences for this ""hospital consultant"" as a result of his or her decision.  No consequences?  That means the consultant was likely following the ""de facto"" treatment guidelines, even if those conflict with the de jure guidelines.

Notice this person was not even named, and there is no indication of consequences in the article.  It is quite likely that he or she is making the exact same decisions in the exact same manner today.  

It seems that the expert who saved this man's life was also not a doctor, but rather a ""private consultant"" who gave a second opinion supporting treatment.

My guess is that this is someone who is qualified to be a ""consultant"", most likely a former hospital consultant who can make things legally awkward for the NHS by providing an expert opinion that they are not following their own rules in patient care.

I think the Seattle mentality suits being a Spurs fan you all seem to thrive when times are bleak, lol. 

I'm also an honorary Seahawks fan try and follow them whenever I'm awake at 3am and the NFL is on.  As for watching Spurs over there it's much easier than watching it here most of the 3pm games are televised outside of the UK, but if all else fails I use wiziwig every week and will be later today, might start posting up a link to the wiziwig page of game streams when they're on.

In another way you've got to consider that regenerating is basically wiping away the old personality and putting a new one in, so while the new man has all the old one's memories, he won't be the same. 

I don't believe that the doctor is always so similar to his previous regeneration, look at 1 and 2. Very serious old man regenerates into a slightly less serious less old man with a flute. Matt Smith has a very similar take on the Doctor as Tennant had, so that's probably why you see him as being the same in many respects. Watch some of the Smith episodes and you'll see that he's got his own style and is quite different from Tennant.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"Don't worry at all about the downvotes. Sometimes you'll see radical posts attract a number of them, it's not what should happen but no way to stop it. I did put an edit in my first reply trying to limit it. It's always nice to meet someone with a different opinion.

Best thing to do is to try and keep track of the reserve or youth team matches, try and give them a watch and you'll get a sense of the players. The youth team consistently features Feruz, Lukaku and Piazon, who are fun to watch. The FA Youth Cup is currently on-going and the second leg happens soon I think (we're in the semis against United).

Initially I was pretty angry with Lampard after AVB was fired, but as time passes I think what we saw was the media overblow something. AVB was painted as a victim and Lamps as a villain, but I don't believe that anymore. I think Lampard and JT can and will have places in the team. Eventually we'll buy better players than them and I think at that point they'll be ok with being benched. They obviously want to play but more so they want to see the club win. When we lose, they don't want to sit and watch it, which is something admirable and the type of player we should want both on and off the pitch. So I'd hold on to both and not listen to the media reports about ego problems so much.

Plan over the next few years? Keep challenging for the CL and EPL title. We need a new RB now, a new LB arguably very soon depending on the progress of Bertrand and PVA, and in a couple of seasons a new CB to pair with Luiz. I think our midfield will be fine for a few more seasons, but we need wingers this summer. We do have lots of youth so keep sending them out on loan and try to get them first team experience.

I also like the 4-2-3-1 as the German national team used it well, and it makes the best use of Mata, who's probably our best player this year. Just need the wingers to really make it sing.

I'd recall Guidetti, sign Pizarro properly, have a crack at signing RVP, and try to bring in a centre back (nothing too flash, just a Ryan Shawcross or something like that) and an actual winger capable of putting in crosses (not to sound like a Stoke fan, but even if the big names were too pricey I reckon Jermaine Pennant would do the job).

I think the first choice 11 is pretty formidable and I don't see a need to change that, but when Aguero is misfiring, or Silva isn't being given space to operate, we need other ideas.  Dzeko would be so much better with the right aerial supply and we're given a criminal amount space out wide because we don't have the personnel to make best use of it.  Pennant is a great crosser and I think Dzeko would thrive with that kind of player on the wing.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"The English and the Scottish both have defined themselves in terms of the monarchy, albeit with various regional differences. I've found those in the south of England tend to be less bothered about the existence of the monarchy, especially around London. I'd argue it's perhaps due to the proximity of the Royal Family in the south that they are given more importance.

As for evidence, well, there's not that much to prove or disprove my statement, hence my use of 'seem to have' rather than 'definitely have'. The Scottish with independence could declare themselves free of the monarchy, and yet they have stated they wish to retain them. This suggests part of what defines them as Scottish is related to the monarchy on some level at least with regards to heritage.

Of course, this is theoretical and not remotely accountable for the entire country.

I can see why in a modern country you could argue a republican cause because the monarchy is a tradition from days long since gone by. There just is not a logical reason beyond the ideals of liberty and freedom to push for this kind of change. Not enough people care, and there is just as strong a case to argue that the north of England should not be tied to the South purely on ideological grounds.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Read the article. Many are Zero hour jobs, you have a job but you only work when required, I have done this - some weeks I worked 80 hours then weeks of nothing. 

Try to budget and pay your bills when you have no idea where you stand day to day, jobcentre does say that if you do work in a role like this you can get support but the paper work is a nightmare and the errors are so common it is better to starve than to deal with repaying the overpayments. 

What about jobs that cost you money? In home health care is a min wage job that will pay you by the minute (and the lowest I have seen was 10 minutes) but you are required to pay for your CBR check, uniform and transportation (without a mileage allowance). 

You may have 10 minutes a day with twenty people. 

So twenty lots of £ 1.01 a day ( £20.20 a day) whilst paying for your petrol and other costs, you have to follow the schedule set by the agency so you may have neighbours that you see hours apart. On occasions you cover over fifty miles without leaving town, people that care for those in rural areas however can cover three times as far. 

Your working day is only your hands on time so you may start at 7 am and finish at 10 pm but you can spend most of your day just waiting for the next appointment. On top of that if you are a nice person you are in trouble, you cannot walk away from a person that needs help just because your time is up, if they need shopping done or the bills paid you do it. That means you are doing in in your own time and guess what sometimes these people cannot pay you back. 

People that provide this care are aware of this situation but the simple fact is the exploitation of home health care workers makes health care cheaper, but many of the people that I know in this role today will be losing the tax credits and will not gain any more hours.

The last group to consider if the jobs that no one ever gets, I do not know why but I have seen the same jobs week in and week out for years. I have applied for such posts and have never heard anything back, neither has anyone else I have asked. So are these real jobs? 

Despite cutbacks the public sector are advertising jobs all the time? Army, Air Force, Police, Navy, ect. So why are organisations that are reducing staff advertising vacancies?

Doyle was heavily into spiritualism and its claims of psychic phenomena, contact with the dead, and the existence of fairies and spirits.

He could be a psychic projection from Doyle's own mind, made visible by some plot device. Or the Holmes of Doyle's imagination could be an echo of a real being who exists in an alternate dimension. Or an empathic alien like George, the Tenza child in *Night Terrors,* could accidentally imprint upon the character, and essentially become Sherlock Holmes. Maybe the alien wouldn't even know that they aren't actually a human, Victorian genius detective.

Granted Doyle got into Spiritualism later in life, after having been writing Sherlock Holmes for a while.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Unfortunately all BBC News does is fairly report the news cycle; they will very rarely exercise their own judgment as to what constitutes an important story, but in general echo in a softened way what other papers report, or what politicians say.

You can see this from the way headlines change as stories develop. So last week you had Peter Cruddas selling access to the PM, and the web browsing snooping plan. The headline progression is something like ""Tory Chairman 'sells access to PM'"", then a couple of hours later ""Conservative chairman defended over cash-for-access claims"", then ""Conservative chairman fired over cash-for-access claims"". The next day, there will be a couple of subsidiary stories, the day after that nothing. Similarly the web snooping headline initially reports the story, then changes later to something like ""Deputy PM defends web surveillance plan"", and then disappears the next day. They will even change the headline on the 'most viewed' section, so it gives the impression that the country is desperately interested in reading about politicians' spin on a scandal, rather than about the scandal itself.

The effect is that BBC News acts to soften the impact of any story, provides an easy route for politicians to broadcast their response, and then encourages everyone to move on the next day. Of course there's lots of good stuff that goes on at the BBC, R4*, Newsnight, and Panorama, but the general news offering is pretty poor.

Everyone reads what they want into it of course, but the kind of things that persuaded me are:

* Removal of nuclear weapons (I don't see a scenario where firing them is useful).
* Less likely to participate in Iraq/Afghanistan/Libya (if the US gets involved in Iran, the UK will too: I don't think Scotland would - or even, could).
* More focus on renewables (our current target is [100% by 2012](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/geenenergytargets29032012) for electricity, which is much more aggressive than the UK).
* Disagree with the ""privatisation"" of the NHS (to what degree the reforms are ""privatisation"" are debatable, and they don't affect NHS Scotland, but I think there will undoubtedly be a knock-on effect for us).
* We have long-standing problems with health, education, and drink which the UK haven't solved (I think this is something we need to fix for ourselves, and a smaller country with a smaller government will be less able to ignore this).
* We have an unhealthy obsession with Thatcher and the '80s; they weren't great for Scotland, but we need to stop blaming others for our ills and decide what kind of country we want to be.
* Issues like the Barnett Formula or the West Lothian Question are trotted out regularly, so why not put those to rest permanently.
* Become more engaged with Europe: I don't think we should join the Euro in the short term (it's certainly convenient for travel, but less-so given that most of our trade would continue to be with the UK), but I think we have more in common with some of the continent politically than with ""normal"" UK politics.

In essence I see devolution as a success, and independence as the logical conclusion of that (perhaps via an intermediate ""devo-max"" period, but I think that's simply delaying the inevitable).

I don't find the arguments against to be terrible convincing - financial instability is probably the most significant, however even without oil/gas we contribute in revenue about what we receive in expenditure so I think that has been overplayed a bit.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Firstly, apologies for the late reply. I didn't want to type a long response from my phone and I've been super busy recently. Secondly, thanks for valuing my opinion enough to ask, appreciate it

Just got done watching the match, another stinker frankly. Aside from the penalty we created very little, all the 30 yard blasts in the first half were getting on my nerves. We could and should have gone 4th, the morale boost would have been superb. As it is, we still need Spurs to continue screwing up, and Newcastle to stop winning. We fail to score a second goal and are punished, same shit all season long

I think a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 are similar enough to be deployed during the same match, it really depends on how defensive 2 of your midfielders are and how attacking the third one is, the one playing behind the striker

Starting in defence, LB and RB are both problem positions. Bertrand deserves time to develop and get more games under his belt, splitting the position with Ashley. When I say split, I don't mean the usual Chelsea split of ""You play Carling Cup, I play everything else"", I mean he gets 10 games in the league and others in cups. At RB, offload Ferreira and Bosingwa. Ivanovic would be a 4th choice CB and a 2nd choice (albeit close) RB with a big signing. Time to bring in a younger, much faster full back who can skin defences on the break. Utd have Rafael, Arsenal have Sagna, City have Richards we have a CB converted in to an RB, and it shows. Actually, if Micah ever became available I would go for him

Defence: Cole, Bertrand, Terry, Cahill, Luiz, Ivanovic, New RB

Midfield now. Again, Romeu needs many more games and experience to grow in to the team. Essien is not the player he once was and if somebody offered to take him, I'd do the deal. Mikel is only 24 and has been better this year, he stays. Lampard I'm not so sure about, if a Chinese/American team came in for him, it might be time for him to move on. Not been great this year and he's on £140k a week. Should add here that offloading Ferreira and Bosingwa would free up around £120k a week also, probably more. Malouda needs to go, Ramires is free to stay, Meireles would ideally be on the first train out of London

Midfield: Mikel, Romeu, Ramires, Lampard, McEachran, new midfielder (top class, big money)

Up front, we have the issue with Drogba. I believe he'll leave during the Summer and he has looked a shadow of his former self at times this season. We have De Bruyne coming in, Lukaku is still here, Piazon may be breaking in to the first team, Mata is doing great, Torres is looking sharper. Kalou, as I've discussed previously, should be kept as a squad player. We need 2 wingers here, many believe the Willian deal is done already, hopefully we can sign Hazard. Torres, Sturridge and Lukaku to split striking duty, don't think we need to splash money on Cavani/Falcao. Lavezzi would be more useful for us than Cavani. De Bruyne's preferred position is where Mata/Piazon want to play, behind the striker, but he can and does play on the wing, similar to Mata

Attack: Mata, Sturridge, Torres, Kalou, Piazon, De Bruyne, Lukaku, 2 wingers

So there you go. I think if we can ship out Malouda, Meireles, Ferreira, Bosingwa, Drogba and bring in the 6-7 new players we need (including those out on loan) we'll be in better shape.

1)Rory makes the decision to stay in a heartbeat without really considering the consequences. He does it out of love, but the minute the Doctor disappears we see the weight of the decision he just made fall on his shoulders. He looks around glumly for something to do and then pathetically sits down. It is not a simple question of duty.

2) Even if we buy all of the arguments made here by those who are pro Amy there is still no explanation as to why there is no mention of Rorys heroic action. Nobody mentions it in this episode. Why does Amy get to act stroppy but we cannot even acknowledge what Rory did.

3) Amy feeling betrayed is part of a much greater problem with the show. It is not that they ignore Rory's action here, but that they continually ignore it throughout the series. In the entire of series 6 there is only **one** moment when a character comments on the time Rory spent guarding the pandorica. Thought hey occasionally dress Rory up as a roman nobody ever comments on the sacrifice he made. Meanwhile Amy is often referred to as ""the girl who waited"" because she both spent her childhood waiting for the Doctor and the 36 years mentioned here. They even make it clear that she is a model for a perfume called the girl who waited. It is used as a term of endearment, but it is jarring when Rory is so completely ignored. Amy never comments on Rory's sacrifice.

true,RippedTroll,null,null,"Ok, I'm going to go on a bit of a rant here, but I was incredibly frustrated watching us play today.  Not because we dropped points to a weaker team, but because of the effort we put into it today.  They looked like a team that had nothing to play for today.  We're in a dogfight for fourth with a legitimate chance at grabbing it and they come out today and put fourth an effort like that.  Unmotivated and uninspired.

I don't care if the team drops points, but I want to see them go out and give a solid effort every night, and I didn't see that tonight.  If I have to watch these guys pass the ball along the back line for 5 minutes and then lose it I might just lose my mind.  

That said, it wasn't the whole team that played poorly tonight, I thought Lampard (beast), Terry, Ivanovic and Cech put out a great effort, but sadly it wasn't matched by the rest of the team.

It's just really disappointing because I was expecting them to come out strong and play some desperate football after the Tottenham result, but  they came out and did the complete opposite. We're going to need to really pick it up if we want to finish in the top four this year and its looking less and less likely by the week.  

Oh and Mata shouldv'e started today.  He's 24 years old for God's sake, even with our tight schedule he should be starting every game.  Meireles was god awful tonight.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"I think what hurts more than most is the fact that the team KNEW how important the game was. They knew Spurs had lost. They knew a win with a 2-goal difference would catapult us to 4th - major psychological boost, that. They must have known we had to win - at all costs. 

And yet, they didn't. 

They stopped trying after that first goal. Fatigue? Fixture-congestion? Weren't we landing RDM for his rotation policy a few days ago? Wasn't the midfield (relatively) fresher? 

Lamps was slow, Mikel was d'oh and Meireles was one tackle short of being/doing a Balotelli. That said, none of the cards today were legit, although Meireles certainly seemed to deserve his. 

Ramires is not a winger. Kalou is just that much short of skills that he makes you want to tear your hair out in frustration. Torres needs Mata, not Lamps. If Lamps dwelled anymore on the ball, I'd probably ask him to look into the ball and ask him to predict my future. Also, why wasn't he subbed? (Did he threaten RDM, too?) 

Torres had no shots, eh? He received 32 passes. Kalou received 52. That tells a story, doesn't it? 

They are looking at future fixtures and conserving energy? They have a 5-day rest period after tonight - can't you focus on the here and now? 

Maybe I'm being a little harsh here but I wanted to share what I saw. Maybe you saw it differently. Maybe I am not seeing the larger picture. Maybe I don't get the game and the art of the game.

But he hasn't always been. Part of want Smith and Moffat are doing is harkening back to the first few Doctors.

In some ways Amy/Rory parallel Ian/Barbara, his first human companions. And in those stories the humans were the focus; the Doctor acted much more as a classical Mentor figure.

I think Jamie/Zoe had a similar dynamic going on, though frankly I haven't seen enough of the second Doctor's run to be sure of that.

As it is, you act like a dick and do nothing to further an issue in the direction you think is right.

You can't find a comment where I've demonstrated overwhelming left leaning in this thread, *not* because you can't be arsed, but because it isn't there! If you've even had the balls to look (I doubt you have the intellectual integrity to go back and check, because you're afraid that you might discover that - shockhorror! - you're wrong) you won't find it.

Meanwhile the fact that you were using an erroneous point to push your opinions is lost in midst of you trying to make yourself look like the bigger man by claiming not to care. Does that work for you in every day life?

The problem you seem to have is integrity, or rather a lack of it.

I'll repeat: I have not argued against your particular thoughts on whether or not immigrants etc. are taking our money/using our services unfairly.

But you assumed. You decided I'd picked up on a problem with your opinion, or the way you were going about justifying it, because I was completely politically opposed to you. ""Someone seems to not be agreeing with me completely! Lefty bastard!"" 

I'll point out, though you know it already, that you were the one who decided to start using ad homs etc. You're claiming to have been drunk and what not, but I find it interesting that you still claim to be correct but 'can't be arsed' to make it clear. And continued to attack me instead of addressing the problem in the first place: One you claim you now can't be bothered about. Good show! Why make sure our opinions are based on solid foundations? What a waste of energy.

RTD-era companions had extended families and back stories and secondary recurring characters that deliberately reflected the diversity of modern Britain.

1) you say you think she is more fleshed out than other characters. How do you reconcile the Amy of series 5 who had no parents, to the Amy of series 6 who did. Why is there no mention of her entire history.

2)I like the concept of Amy is a flawed character, and thus this makes her better. Unfortunately this is not a theory ever explored within the show. The show focus on the positives, she is always Glorious Pond or the Girl who Waited. They ignore more negative aspects, specifically things like trying to shoot children or the fact that she messes with Rory. Neither the Doctor or Rory ever criticize Amy.

3) I am not saying that I would not shoot a child to save the Doctor myself. The problem is specifically that the Doctor never critisizes this action. Imagine you are Amy and you have just broken the number one rule and tried to shoot and kill another human being. Try and explain this action to the Doctor without revealing that you know he will die. It is important that we see the aftermath of important occasions like this, otherwise we lose Amy's human element. For example we see her try and shoot, but we neither see any remorse, guilt or even critisizm.

It depends on individual papers, not everything is like Fox News, which is the far side of Bat Country. 

&gt; Which countries have high journalistic standards?

I don't know. Mainly because the majority of the worlds press is printed in languages I can't read. I don't think the UK is particularly bad though, but market forces are making them play to their base more than have done previously. After all, I can get my news from anywhere, so the only reason I would ""buy"" what the Guardian et al is selling is if they have something which others don't, which is news which ties in perfectly to my view of the world.
 
&gt; What would you consider to be an unbiased news source? One that does not have an agenda.

If your just talking about the presentation of news, and not which stories are covered, then AP, Reuters, Press Association and other news agencies. 

&gt; Maybe because you don't agree with the guardians point of view you tend to notice their bias a lot more - so it irritates you a lot more.

Partially true, I don't agree with the Guardian's current stance. Since the 2010 election they have been in seemingly endless downward spiral where everything is terrible and everything is the fault of the coalition, and this bias does annoy me. Which is a shame, because prior to the election they were far more even handed. Sure, the coalition has made some errors, but the deck was going to be stacked against whomever won the last election. 

The other issue is that because they have by far the best online news presence in the UK they do tend to dominate the UK subreddits (it also doesn't help if submissions from the Telegraph are derided because they are from the Torygraph). And because of the way they twist the news to match their own agenda it does distort debate.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"1) They are not two different Amys, they are the same Amy with two histories. Watch the short clip ""Good Night"" for more explanation on reconciling of the two histories.

2) I think it's more that the Doctor chooses to focus on peoples' strong aspects rather than their weak ones. Everyone has flaws, and everyone has glorious aspects about their personality. The Doctor chooses to focus on the latter.

3) Actually we never really see much of his reaction to this. It's the very end of the episode, and the next episode starts 3 months later with Canton chasing down the Doctor's companions. I agree that this was bad writing and this episode was by far the worst in the last 2 series. There's a lot of things they simply skipped over that needed screen time.

I don't disagree that Amy is a bit more shallow than most companions the Doctor has, but she's also basically a good person, and is very realistic. The whole struggling to decide between Rory and the Doctor thing is great in my opinion, because I could easily see that happening in real life.

Beast Below: She didn't forget GB was on a whale, she knew that because the whale was like the Doctor, the whale wouldn't let Great Britain get hurt.

Flesh and Stone- yeah, cold feet for weddings and all. She wanted a fling though, not to start up a new serious relationship with the Doctor. I'd rather be cheated on with a fling than another significant other. I mean sure it wasn't a nice thing to do, but it's better than cheating in a significant relationship with someone else.

Vampires of venice- the Rory relationship thing is pointed out in order to draw a difference between
Rory and the Doctor. Rory would rather stay home, use common sense, and not get himself killed or dazzled by the Doctor.

Impossible Astronaut- yeah, she did try to kill a child, because, as you say, she didn't know! Breaking
the golden rule? Ha! The 10th Doctor pointed a gun at people in his last hours. He's snapped a guy's neck once, tried to murder a caveman, and shot tons of aliens in many of his incarnations. Golden rule my BUM. Okay, calm down.

Day of Moon- The constant leading along of who Amy ""truly loves"" is annoying, I agree.. The worst in Amy's Choice.

Rebel Flesh/Almost People: Amy is a human being, humans have flaws. If TARDIS companions were perfect it would be totally unrealistic. It was a chance for her to grow as she realized her
prejudice by the story's end. That's good! She improved.

Let's Kill Hitler- What? No, when the Doctor shows up the first thing she asks is if the Doctor has found Melody- because that's what they were waiting for him to do.

Girl Who Waited- I am sick of this argument that Rory had it worse. The cicumstances were totally
different. Take this quote from jimmysilverrims:

*Yes. For one, Rory was made of plastic the entire time. He didn't tire, he didn't get hungry, he didn't have a sex drive, he probably didn't even have typical mental stasis and likely didn't get bored as easily and questioned his own actions less.*

*Obviously Rory didn't face much fighting or stress because even after 1000+ years of being told that any injury to him was permanent (even the tiniest scuff) he shows up in the museum without a single scratch on him. That really screams ""I didn't have to do much"".*

*Rory also had the benefit of travelling Europe and being in a place that was at least marginally familiar to how he lived. Amy was stuck in a blindingly white and alien environment knowing that there was no chance she'd be able to escape. There were androids that could kill her in a single touch, she didn't have the benefit of not needing to eat or sleep, and she wasn't exactly the picture of mental health going in there to begin with.*

*So really the two instances really don't compare.*

1. Let's ignore Moffat's ability to forget to include character emotions and pose the question:
How would you feel if your daughter who came from a pregnancy you weren't even aware you had went missing and reappeared as a woman older than you who went around kicking space ass, saving *your* ass, and snogging your best friend? That's emotionally confusing. It would take a while to figure out how one felt about that.

2. As for Rory and Amy, if Rory really was jealous and sick of the way Amy treats him, he could just break it off. And if Amy really wanted to be with the Doctor, she could to. You don't have to be in a relationship where your spouse makes grandiose gestures of love. Rory knows that underneath Amy's tough exterior, she's loyal to Rory, and Amy knows that Rory understands that she's not one of the lovey-dovey type, in contrast to Rose.",0,1334015743,null,0,true,0,c4acz6z,t3_s1j0m,t1_c4acz6z,t3_s1j0m,null,1428688218,27,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,27

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"Spending:

Wahoidles is dead on when he looks at how much we spent on Torres but fails to also factor in how much we spent on AVB before sacking him (£13.3M). 

Between the two the club shelled out £63.3M and is getting a proper shit ROI - Torres' recent improving form aside, I personally think he's been underwhelming his entire stay. £50M is a lot of money to spend on a striker to perform at *okay* level. We could have brought in two or three players for the money we've spent on an okay Torres and a manager we sacked.

The club needs to not piss money away on huge money signings that end up being a bust.

Young players:

Like it or not at some point the club is going to have to start putting our young players up to task. I understand the importance of loaning young players out but something isn't working here. We have zero creativity and zero threat up front, we can't just Bertrand our young talent and keep them on loan forever.

This summer we should take these young players on tour (which I'm assuming Chelsea is going to do) and work them into the greater framework of the team. We go on and on about the talent and promise we've got out on loan - it's time to reap. Piazon, De Bruyne, Lukaku, Davila, Kakuta, and McEachran. These guys we call our future, and who I trust will be, need to start playing first team stuff over the summer.

Planning and Management:

We need to stop doing things year to year. Our board needs to come up with a five year plan, or longer, for the club. We can't keep shifting management year in and year out like we're doing. It fucks up team cohesion and that's not going to get better with the young players we've got. 

We need a solid manager who Roman isn't going to fire year in and year out. I don't count on getting a guarantee on that but we can hope.

It's this season to season mentality that's killing us. Torres (sorry I'm using FT as my whipping boy here) was a £50M patch in the latter half of Carlo's last season. AVB ended up being a £13.3M patch to turn us into league contenders this year. Whoever is setting the direction of the club within the bowels of Chelsea management needs to pull their head out of their ass and have a bit more foresight.

Worst case scenario, if we only manage to get into Europa at the end of this season we can put our otherwise green players through their paces in European competition.

We have all the tools at our disposal to help us not shit the bed like Liverpool, hopefully we use them instead of making a £150M three player deal that ends up doing shit all in the long run.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Yep, not dating Jeff. In fact, I'm not really getting who Jeff is in relation to Amy. Is he like, a friend? A close neighbor? I dunno, but he likely wasn't Rose's boyfriend, and Let's Kill Hitler kind of portrays exactly when she started going out with Rory and it's assumed that continued until they got married.

First, I'm pretty sure it was a whale. Not totally sure, but I remember something about a space whale. Secondly, Amy did choose to have her memory wiped so that the Doctor wouldn't investigate and try to free the Whale (which is really odd given her empathy to the beast later, and shows an unprecedented amount of forethought in someone who's pretty impulsive).

She was *engaged*. You don't try to bone another dude when your wedding *is tomorrow*. That is just *ice cold*, or rather über-selfish and thoughtless. I know it was a one-time thing, but it's still super insensitive to *your husband*.

And again, in Vampires in Venice she says Doctor can be husband, Rory can be brother. That's *fucking cold*. Your fiancee won't even *pretend* to be married to you, but will do such with some other guy (who she tried to bone earlier, if I may bring to attention).

The Doctor's ""Golden Rule"" has really only come into effect since the Time War. He mentions having stripped the TARDIS of all weaponry after it and ever since he hasn't brought himself to actually fire a gun at someone unless it was all of reality at stake.

Totally agreed.

I'm just shocked at how the Doctor straight-up murdered a Ganger at the end like it's no big deal or how he has GangerDoctor hold up the door and use the sonic on the GangerBeast when he could have done it himself *or* just gotten everybody to run in the TARDIS unharmed. But then again we can't have two Doctors about *again*. 

Hey! That's me! I said that! I'm *famous!*

1. I'd be pretty shocked at the pregnancy alone, so all that other stuff is really just going to emotionally baffle me.

2. Funny thing: [Series 7 SPOILERS:](/s ""Rory's holding divorce papers in the new series. Apparently this means the two are actually considering divorce, which I think is very good for both of them as characters to go through."")

true,Mink11,tardis,TARDIS,"* My big problem with Amy, outside of my general dislike for any of the companions falling in love with the Doctor. Is she complains, especially in the 6th Season. The Doctor never lands where he is supposed to, but Amy always always bitches about it. Big deal you ended up in a haunted hotel in space instead of a planet with super huge people, deal with it. I hate her a little more every time. 

* No matter how you feel about her, the real issue stems from the fact that Amy has been on the show since we met 11. In fact, she is the foil character and the center of the plot far more often than the Doctor, which seems decidedly different than in previous seasons. 
Eg. The crack follows her around space and time, it stole her family, Pandorica is all about her, everything Rory related (living and dying and waiting around for her), her daughter gets taken... etc etc etc. My least favorite Rose episode is when she tries to save her father. Yet, we've been sitting through the life and times of Amy Pond for what seems like forever. 
For a show like this to actually surround a normal human we end up with a non-believable character, with a history that makes no sense, and a love triangle subplot created to add tension that gets particularly creepy when she becomes the Doctor's mother in law. 

* I always felt like Rory was a much more interesting and dynamic companion, he gets mad at the Doctor and challenges his decisions. Most interestingly, he sees him for what he is far better than any of the other companions, even Donna. There is far less hero worship between them. To me, Rory is actually the Doctor's friend rather than some one who tags along just to be in awe of him.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Oops why did I say turtle? My brain farted. Yes, it was totally a whale.

Y'know, it's not good but it's understandable. I mean, why is it a ""thing"" for men to have bachelor parties before they get married? It's one last fling before they're ""chained"" for life. Guys have bachelor parties but Amy can't make a pass at someone else who she *knows* she's never going to have a long term relationship with anyways. And it's not like her actions go unaddressed- that immediately becomes the Doctor's concern. I think it was really bad of her, but I don't despise her for it.

About the Vampires of Venice, I think you're overreacting again. Amy was definitely rubbing it in and being a jerk (perhaps she wanted Rory to fight for her?) but I don't think she was trying to give him the cold shoulder or any-whatsits. If anything I really think she was trying to get a rise out of him.

And then we see how Rory handles this? He responds with some insight into what the Doctor does to people. Rory has known Amy all her life, he knows what kind of mind crap she's getting twisted up in. To Rory's credit, he handles this really well. If I found out my fiancee tried to do that, I'd be pissed.

One point about underlining the whole ""one last fling before marriage"" is the idea that her wedding is ""tomorrow"". One reason why she goes with the Doctor is so she can escape her marriage. Amy is young, she's afraid of commitment, so she runs away from it. It was her bachelor party in a way.

The Doctor's 'golden rule' only really applied to 10. 9 was definitely trying to be no violence, but I think he was willing to do what it took (series 1 finale?) whereas 10 could not handle guns.

As for the ganger thing- yeah that didn't make sense to me at all. I think that both the Doctors knew there ""could""/should be only one Doctor so they both agreed that the ganger Doctor would let himself ""die"" (and maybe later reform and have his own experiences to become his own individual). As for killing the AmyGanger, that Ganger was never sentient or an individual- it was just flesh linked to Amy.

Now, further Americanism here, but what difference does it make for them to play a day early? Especially if it's something that they've possibly been doing for years?

The thing that everyone needs to keep in mind is Amy's life.  (She obviously didn't change in the reboot, probably eye of the storm or something)

She grew up without parents.  She had a very goofy man appear suddenly, do amazing things and promise to take her away only to have him not return.  She had to go through years of therapy for this.  Traumas like this led her to become a little more than a stripper.  Meanwhile she has entered in a relationship with her best friend which is  an awkward transition.  But she's ok.  She's gotten past the whole imaginary friend thing, and she is ready to take the next step with Rory, when BAM, invisible friend shows back up and whisks her away on an amazing journey.  Her whole world is turned inside out.  In her head she is reminded of this romantic view of the doctor taking her away from a miserable life as a child and this rushes back to the forefront.  Add a ridiculous amount of adrenaline, and yeah, she tried to kiss him.

Throw in these confused feelings with Rory returning, (someone who she views and always will view as more of a brother than a husband) and of course she'll have mixed feelings.

You complained about her not caring enough about her baby, yet killing a woman because she stole her baby.  Like said by jimmy, she has a very confused feeling on this baby.  She never even knew she was pregnant and spent what, 2 months with her?  Add in the fact that she KNOWS the baby will be ok in the end.

If you're staring at the ceiling how well can you write, in charcoal, on your skin, ""Silents are on the ceiling, don't look up""?

Pressing a button without knowing which does dooming her... Well gee it was only a button. I mean nobody expects a button to have such drastic effects, obviously you wouldn't give it your utmost concentration. If you just happened to push the wrong one, you would shrug and think, ""Oh I'll just have to go back and push the other button."" Who would've expected a dual time stream facility to trap you an alternate timeline where you'd be isolated for the rest of your life?

Swinging a sword and bandying a loaded weapon against warnings? Well good lord when is it *ever* a good idea to do these things? Yet it's done all the time in the show by the Doctor. It's like his job to pretend he knows what he's doing and bumble through it and take incredibly stupid risks. The bad part is that Rory can be a tough Roman who spears a Cyberman and uses an Auton handgun, the Doctor can use every weapon and take every risk imaginable, but when Amy tries to do it, she sucks at it, as if it's for the show's laughs. The sword she did fine with, but it's definitely used for laughs the way she handles that gun in series 7.

I don't think she gets sensitive when it services the plot, I think that when things get tight and the situation seems truly dire (Bracewell exploding) that Amy drops the tough girl exterior and gets real.

Additionally, having a party with booze and a stripper isn't the same as *boning a Time Lord*. It wasn't just a pass, it was getting *all up over him* with the intent of space-bonin'.

Alright, so you're hitting you fiancee in a soft spot (remember that Rory din't make a pass at *any girl* ever since he met Amy. This dude is *in love*.) for the sake of... I dunno, trying to get him pissed for fun. So she's being mean to try and manipulate him? I think being simply cold would be worse than being treated like shit just to get a rise out of you.

Rory's young! Jeez, he's probably been waiting for a day like this his whole life, but he's just as inexperienced with relationships as she is (remember that Rory's never been in one other than Amy). He doesn't run away. In fact all he wants to do is be with her.

Nine had to psyche himself up for it, but when it came down to pointing the gun and trying to pull the trigger, he always chokes and he'll say (like in Dalek) that he never could have pulled the trigger.

The point about the bachelor parties is, is that guys are known to have parties and get some action (maybe not Rory, but other guys), and Amy is seriously getting your hate for doing the same thing that many guys around the world must do.

Plus, whether it was nice of her or not, Amy wasn't happy about Rory joining the TARDIS crew (like Rose with Mickey), and she was giving him crap for that. Obviously in the context of her making a pass at the Doctor it doesn't add up, but this isn't some kind of weighing of scales. Rory took it, and he stuck with her. I think that the fact that he stood up for her because of the threat of death is less romantic/caring than standing up for her because she goads him into being jealous. Obviously you'd try to protect *anyone* you care about from dying.

Yeah, but when Amy had Rory dress up and play games and make dolls, it was all a make believe game. You argue that Amy never mentioning the Bachelor Party makes it less bad, because she's what, okay with it? Well Rory is totally okay with all the crap that Amy throws at him. By that logic, it's all okay. I don't think it's a tenuous parallel. You may say that the bachelor party of Rory's doesn't compare with weeks with your dream guy, well even if you *hadn't* spent your whole life obsessing over this guy, who wouldn't decline an offer to travel the universe and see the stars? Even Rory would be interested in that (of course he would get out after the danger factor). You say it yourself- going for weeks with your dream guy to see the universe? Nobody can resist taking a detour from a marriage for that. The temptation Amy faced considering her circumstances was enormous. ""The two things don't even compare.""

You have no way of knowing if Amy had no intention on going back.

And if she was goading him into saying that her comparison of the two of them was at a whack *he did*, so I really don't think that's okay. And manipulating people into going into an emotional state, specifically trying to insult them until they lash out, is the traits of a *bully*, it's not something everybody does.

A bachelor party is more tradition than anything, and unlike Amy cavorting with the Doctor Amy says nothing against it. We have exactly *zero* evidence she feels that it's not okay. And yet we have plenty of evidence that Rory's not okay with her adventuring. The difference is that when Amy asks Rory to stop something, *he stops*. When Rory asks similarly, Amy is *extremely* hesitant, even when his requests are mild.

She made it clear that she ""always had more time"". She talked about her wedding day like someone would talk about a meeting they could get to at *any time*. There was no rush, and she took advantage of that.

It's not a lack of empathy that leads me to this conclusion. Amy has shown that she has clear mental fortitude and does not carry many of the attributes of someone ""worshiping"" the Doctor. Hell, she even makes fun of him at times. It's not a consistently portrayed hero-worship dynamic. She knows what she's doing, and she's choosing to do it. From goading Rory into a rise to choosing to avoid the wedding, Amy made every single decision like any adult would, and I hold her accountable to those actions.",0,1334028476,null,0,false,0,c4afi74,t3_s1j0m,t1_c4afi74,t1_c4afcuq,null,1428689394,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

By the way, the all put Tally Marks on themselves. Not just Amy.

I like Amy because she's *real*. She has faults. She has quirks. Yet she always manages to be a friend to everyone. That's a running character trait.

And what you listed about not caring for her kid being stolen, she already *knows* who her kid will be. She knows that despite everything, the kid grows up to be River. And River is brilliant. She was Mels, her best friend growing up. So she knows who she'll be already. Of course she'll worry at night when she's alone with Rory, but she knows there's not much else she can do, so why would she dwell on it? 

About Flesh and Stone when she tried to cheat on Rory. I understand where you're coming from, saying that was a horrible thing to try and do. And it was. But, imagine being a child. A strange man comes in the night, offers to whisk you away. He's mad a impossible and she's fascinated. He leaves her for (what was it, ten years? Can't exactly recall) And then he comes back. She'd been waiting for him for that long. Somewhere along the line, she'd probably fallen in love with the idea of him. She didn't know him that well, but he was so impossible. So it was the *idea* of him. And then he comes back and what does she do? Tries to sleep with him. Because she most likely loves him.

They put tally marks where they could see them, like on their arms, in order to count the Silents. Amy put them on the one place (other than her backside) that she would not be able to see if it weren't for that convenient strike of lightning.

Amy doesn't feel real to me. For someone who went through four psychiatrists she kept biting, a job that clearly displays a level of unhealthy exhibitionism mixed with a desire to take on a persona that is not herself, and growing up with no parents she seems to be so terribly *ordinary*.

She *could* have a worship-like relationship with the Doctor, but that's portrayed inconsistently. Sometimes she's calling him stupid and mocking his fashion sense like he's just some dude and the next we're *informed* that he's her source of faith. It's not something that conveyed through *action* but through being *told* that's the case. Telling without showing.

She doesn't act like a regular person would act in *many* scenarios. If I was captured by Silurians, do you think I would get all indignant, ask if they know who I am, and then scream that I am ""JIMMY SILVERRIMS!"" as if that name means anything to him. Hell, Amy's not even rich *or* famous, and she still does like like she's Wily from the Temple of Doom.

She also doesn't friend everyone or even *try* to friend everyone. On multiple occasions, she has not really cared how the natives saw her, and she rarely tries to be ""friends"" with the people she actually does come in contact with.

No, all she wants to do is ""fix"" them. From Vincent to Rory, to the people of Chaos U.K., the Doctor himself and many others all she does is find their flaws and dictate how to ""fix"" them so that they turn out the way she wants. That's not friendship, that's being manipulative.

She tries to *rape* him. He says no, she keeps at it. That is *definitionally* rape. You would have to want to sleep with the Doctor more than you'd want him to like and respect you, and seeing as the Doctor started out as a *childhood* fascination who was never connected to sex or seen as a partner-type it seems *way* over the line for Amy to try and do that.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I didn't say Rory was happy with it, but that he *took* it. It sucked, and Rory accepted it. The traits of a bully? Well sure, but not be cynical, but people do that to people all the time. I'm not saying it's good or it's excused but it's what happens. And really, how often does Amy manipulate Rory? Also remember that this was my own theory that she was trying to get a rise out of him.

Tradition is no excuse. If anything it just underlines the bias even more. It's *traditional* for a guy to get some last minute action, or at least a stripper before his wedding but it's not okay for Amy to do this. In fact, women weren't even allowed to have *any* relations before their marriage ""back in the day"".

We have zero evidence that she feels it's not okay. That's because Amy and Rory both do the same thing to each other. Amy treats him like crap and takes a pass at the Doctor, Rory has his bachelor party and gets cozy with that ganger, but they both know that they're both loyal to each other.

&gt;Rory's not okay with her adventuring

I can see Rory being concerned about her love for the Doctor (which he knows is just a phase) and her treating him like crap during Vampires of Venice, but Rory has no say about in what Amy can and can't do. It's her choice to go adventuring.

And when do Amy and Rory ask each other to stop doing something to which they respond? I want some support there. Where was she ""extremely hesitant"". This is more loaded language.

Of *course* Amy took advantage of her having plenty of time. That was the point of the travelling - she could run away from her impending commitment to figure junk out. But having this ""plenty of time"" does not mean that she was never going to marry Rory. Because she does in the end, and not because of the Doctor's intervention with Vampires in Venice.

Pointing out Amy's strengths is not empathizing with her. Understanding the circumstances under which Amy made those mistakes from *her* point of view is empathizing.

You cannot forgive her for nearly cheating on Rory before their wedding. Does this mean that if you're ever in a relationship, you would break it off because your spouse cheated on you? Would it offend you more if it was a one night's stand or a long term relationship? In the end, how horrible you find Amy's actions depends on your personal values. Can you not forgive someone for making a mistake? Someone you really really love? You're not even the one in a relationship with Amy yet you're taking it worse than Rory.

Plus, compounding the normal circumstances of a spouse cheating on another, you should take into account her lifetime obsession with the Doctor and the naturally brusque treatment Amy has always given Rory. She calls him 'stupid face' yet it's all good between them. When it comes right down to it, Rory puts up with *all* this crap and stuck with Amy. He wasn't happy at times, but he did it for Amy. He's fine with taking crap from Amy for this reason, so if there' s no harm, there's no foul.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I disagree. The new ownership seems to be in it for the long haul. Everyone always talks about the man city 'galacticos project', as if this were a one time meeting of the best footballers in the world, but this isn't just that. the original galacticos project at real lasted like what, 3 seasons? 4? sure madrid are still one of the best teams in the world, but certainly aren't the unstoppable force they were in the early 2000's, especially in comparison to their direct rivals, barcelona, who have arguably surpassed the form of madrid at their best. chelsea assembled a hell of a team in the mid 2000's but they weren't that great last year, they were even less great this year, and they probably won't do anything spectacular next year, because instead of trying to maintain their edge, they keep trying to rebuild it, and that just isn't sustainable. Cities new owners we're willing to enter a ten year sponsorship deal to bypass fair play regs until the etihad campus starts rolling out new layers for us. That's a move that will eventually pay off, I have no doubt, but it will take time. This is a good indicator that the sheik is not just tying to make city the team of the moment, but a genuine dynasty to outshine the neighbors'. their is no way for that to be even remotely possible if we keep swapping managers every time one of them doesn't win a trophy.

Dempsey can play LW, RW, CM, CAM, and ST and he plays all these positions very well and hell he actually knows how to tackle well.  He could outplay every midfielder we have other than Gerrard, and maybe Lucas at defensive aspects of the game.  He actually creates his own chances, he's a poacher, and he is also unselfish with the ball.

That's just *really mean*. And I'm not really getting the justification for that. Best case scenario: she's trying to get a rise out of him. Worst case: she just wants to be mean.

Rory's just going through the motions. From the looks of it, *he didn't even get the stripper*. He looks with bashful surprise at the cake being wheeled in and it's likely a surprise from the other guys. Remember how terribly devoted he is to Amy. He didn't even *look* at another girl since he knew Amy to the point where she assumed he was gay. It's not like he's doing this to escape the wedding or have some fling. It really just seems to be a party celebrating how much he loves Amy and how happy he is they're getting married.

You act like a Bachelor Party is about escaping marriage and having one last fling, but Rory had *shirts* that said how much he loved Amy. He's not doing this for one last fling. He's doing this because he's just so deliriously happy that he's marrying the girl of his life.

And again, spending weeks at a time (time travel or not, those are years of Amy's life that she chose to spend with the Doctor and not Rory) with some dream guy and then trying to bone him is *not* the same as having a few drinks *while wearing shirts professing your love of your wife*. Amy didn't even *mention* Rory to the Doctor. Rory couldn't shut up about Amy. That's an *enormous* difference. Amy was being deceitful to both Rory and the Doctor, Rory was being pretty up-front with the bachelor party and remained completely loyal to Amy the entire way through.

Rory doesn't like it, but it's not like he's saying ""Amy, I am going to be your husband. Now we are going home."" He's saying ""you almost *died*, I can't stand the thought of losing you. Please come home."" There should be a level of respect between the two of them, and while Rory respects that Amy wants to be with the Doctor (he doesn't like it, but he respects it), Amy just ignores his pleas to go home. There's no reciprocation there. There's no returned respect.

Several times Rory says ""let's go home"" or in Amy's Choice he says ""this reality's the real one"" both to which Amy flat-out says no to or otherwise attempts to skirt his opinions. Later in Hungry Earth Rory asks for the ring back (which really seems out-of-character for Rory, he loves Amy more than any material possession, why would he be stingy with the ring?) and she *very reluctantly* agrees.

I understand what she's been through and who she is, and every decision she's made has been self-serving. She's an adult clearly capable of thinking of others, and yet she consistently ignores the pleas of those who love her in exchange for her own gratification. That's something I can understand, but I certainly cannot say is something I really would do myself by any stretch.

No, it's not just the make out session and attempt to bone some childhood idol. That's something I can at least understand. Even the going for weeks on adventures is something I can forgive (difficultly, but I can forgive). It's the *lying* that I'm not cool with. The fact that she tried to hide it all from me and it took *the other person* to get me involved. The fact that she never really gives an apology for what she did and instead gives him a punch on the arm. That just shows that she's going to be childish and self-serving and not feel bad about it. That's something that I just am not going to feel respect for afterwards.

So if you can push him around without him saying anything, suddenly it's okay? It's not okay. It's not like Rory doesn't experience sadness or heartache. If you prick him, he does bleed. Let's not act like her brusque behaviour is somehow justified simply because Rory's too much of a doormat to speak up for himself.

I've considered her obsession, and if she had simply said ""let's go with the Doctor!"" I would have been all for it. Even if she had said ""I tried making out with the Doctor"" I think I'd be alright with that, because he is her childhood idol. It's the lying.

If you look at our early games which were so wildly successful, our strikers were directly responsible for dictating the flow of our game, even if much of the actual legwork was done by silva. balotelli simply doesn't do this, and I think playing him as often as we have, and trying to modify that strategy to fit his needs when the others were tired diluted it somewhat. I especially think it has caused dzeko to be neglected, not necessarily in terms of playing time, but his importance to the style of play that developed as the year has worn on.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Again with the bachelor parties, it isn't a comparison on Amy and Rory's loyalty. I'm not comparing Rory's bachelor party with Amy's fling, but with the idea that it's okay for males in society to have bachelor parties and why it's suddenly horrible for Amy to have her own version. Leave Rory out of that comparison. Even if Rory chooses not to have one, tons of males have, and this same ""tradition"", right, whatever you want to call it, should be extended to females too. Or neither.

Amy didn't spend years of her life with the Doctor, she only had 4 stories before Rory joined the crew and then she cried and screamed when he ""died"" in the Silurian story shortly thereafter. Three stories later he comes back and becomes part of ""the crew"".

Of course Amy didn't mention Rory to the Doctor, she was getting away from Rory, the marriage, the commitment. It's not like the Doctor brings up all the past companions he's had to every new one he gains. Her not bringing Rory up isn't a sign of her not loving him. It's not a sign of ""being deceitful"" or lying by omission. It's not like Amy came to travel with the Doctor with the sole plan in her mind to get into his pants and thus specifically *didn't* tell either of them. When she decided to snog the Doctor she said that it came to her during the angel incident- it made her think about 'what she wanted, and *who* she wanted'. It was spontaneous, emotional, right after a near death experience.

""Rory couldn't shut up about Amy""

We never see Rory talk to *anyone* other than Amy and the Doctor. This is exaggeration.

Rory wants Amy to come home and Amy wants to stay travelling with the Doctor. To say that Rory respected this and Amy didn't is bias on your part. They both knew what the other wanted. Just because Amy didn't comply after Rory voiced his views doesn't mean she didn't respect him. Respect does not mean compliance.

When does Rory say ""let's go home""? And Amy's Choice was entirely an episode about what Rory wants versus what Amy wants. Rory wanted to settle down, Amy wanted to keep adventuring. They both had opposing views. That's why Amy refused the Leadworth dream and Rory refused the TARDIS dream. To say that Amy's refusal makes her selfish and Rory's refusal *doesn't* is again, bias.

As for the ring, you yourself point out that this is out of character for Rory who loves Amy to death. And Amy does love Rory too, of course she's hesitant about the ring. That isn't a request for Amy to treat Rory better that she ignores, that was concern about their relationship that they were both having. Her reluctance doesn't make her selfish. I mean what message does that send to Amy? That Rory doesn't love her anymore? I'd be worried.

Yes, Amy's an adult. She doesn't ""consistently"" ignore the ""please of those who love her"" but rather the consistent plea of one person, Rory. The two of them have a fundamental disagreement about traveling with the Doctor. Constant refusal to agree with Rory doesn't compound her selfishness.

Now you're changing your argument. Now the failed pass at the Doctor isn't your problem or the adventuring, but now it's the lying. Okay. Which as I said above, wasn't actively lying. Amy had continuous adventures with the Doctor in outer space, it's not like the opportunity rose up for her to tell him. And tell him what? That the man Amy idolized had come back to pick her up when Rory already knew he had returned in the Eleventh Hour? The idea of her ""lying"" is also without ground because up until when Amy snogs the Doctor, they did not have a budding romantic relationship. There was nothing to hide until she kissed the Doctor and then Rory found out immediately afterwards.

""it took the other person to get me involved""

Think about the speed of the scene. Amy snogs the Doctor and then they immediately rush off to tell Rory. There was no cool down time, Amy didn't even know where the Doctor was taking her, she was thrust from snogging, to the TARDIS, and to Rory. So Amy wasn't even given a chance to lie about the first sign of a romantic relationship blooming between her and the Doctor (which failed anyways).

So really, Amy had no time or chances to lie about any romantic relationship between her and the Doctor.

As for Rory, he's not a doormat. He takes all kinds of crap, but if Amy went to far, if Amy did something that would truly piss Rory off, he would say 'this is too much'. The general brusque way she treats him is okay because he knows and she knows that it's just her way and it works for them. That's their relationship. The only time Amy is truly mean to Rory is your main support- Vampires of Venice. But they reconcile in Amy's choice (Amy dying for him) and Amy certainly shapes up after her fling and her love is evident in his death and the Big Bang, and the fact that they get married.

So really, if your new problems are that Amy lies and treats Rory badly, it's solved. She didn't lie and they reconciled the only true moment of 'meanness'. Their relationship isn't destructive. Amy is more selfish and fierce than the normal companion. I'm fine with that, I forgive her flaws. This is really up to personal values and preference. Since you don't like Amy in general, your position is understandable. I get that.

Chelsea has always been good against Barcelona. It is not because they are an easy team to play but it is because there is that fight in the Chelsea squad, if ignited, it makes us the toughest opponent you can face. When it comes to facing a very tough team our squad really does step it up. It is for this very reason that we rarely lose big matches with a high margin scoreline.

The last time we faced Barcelona it left enough incentive for the boys to go kill it out when we will face them again. Every player in the world is unstoppable. As for Messi, he rarely ever showed up against Chelsea and we can just as well do it again.

I will go as far as saying that I will be surprised if Barcelona can give us a beating. We might be having finishing problems but somehow we made it and we can just as well do it again. Barcelona feel like this trophy is already theirs and no one deserves to win it but them. They feel like royalty and our players have seen them celebrate while doing fuck all against Chelsea and stealing the trophy from us. 

I expect us to be very aggressive from the starting whistle. We will get aggressively defensive in the away leg and will try to hit them on the counter only while trying to keep a clean sheet. Our midfield and even Torres/Drogba putting pressure on Barcelona and not letting them take time on the ball to thread many cruical passes.

On the home leg I see us playing for the win and we will either achieve it or we will come up just a goal short. The Barcelona fans and neutrals are already celebrating a 10-0 banging but they really have no idea what they are getting into.

This is Chelsea Football Club. We will show up when it matters and we will have our revenge. I cannot wait for the match to start already. Win or lose, we will shut all these haters up again and they will forget it just like they always do with their gold fish memory.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"It doesn't matter what ""equipment capable of receiving live broadcasts..."" you have in your posession - it's how you use said equipment. I currently own the following items that are all capable of receiving live broadcasts:

* Main Computer.
* HTPC.
* Netbook.
* iPhone.
* 24"" Monitor [has a digital tuner inside it]
* TV in my bedroom [has a Freeview HD tuner]

I know I've got this equipment - and so do TV licencing. Mostly because I sent them a letter outlining all the equipment I own, what I use it for, and telling them I wanted a refund on the remaining ""units"" on my TV licence years ago. And that they weren't to contact me to ""check up"" on my usage of said equipment.

End result? I got the refund I wanted, as well as an email confirming that I'm perfectly within the law to own all the above equipment, and provided I continue to operate it the way I outlined, I didn't require a TV licence.

There's two easy ways to ""prove"" to TV licencing something that you really shouldn't have to prove anyway:

* Send an email to them / letter via recorded delivery outlining the equipment you own, confirming you don't use said equipment to watch live broadcasts, and either request a refund if applicable, or state that as a result, you don't need a licence, and that any communications from them will be considered harassment.

This will usually last upto four years. So, after four years / however long they stick to it.

* When they contact you again, prepare an affidavit [takes five minutes] that basically says you don't use any of your equipment for the purposes of receiving live broadcasts. Get it witnessed by a solicitor, and send it, via recorded delivery to TVL. The entire process should cost around £10.

**tl:dr:** I own six pieces of equipment ""capable of receiving live broadcasts"" as well as a DAB radio¹. TV Licencing are aware of this - because I told them - and they not only agree it's perfectly legal, they actually gave me a refund on my old licence. I haven't been hassled - either by ""inspectors"" or by post, for years.

Think it has something to do with the 2 Semi Finals not allowed to be played on the same day - since they're both hosted at Wembley (also probably to do with TV rights). So one game would have had to be played on the Saturday, one on the Sunday. Because we don't play on the 15th it means the Liverpool v Everton game gets the Saturday slot resulting in Chelsea v Spurs getting the Sunday by default. Which means Chelsea have to play on Sunday, and then again on Wednesday for the Champions League before their weekend game at Arsenal on the Saturday. So what I assume he's complaining about is that by us not playing on the 15th we're making it unfair on Chelsea who have 3 (tough) games in a 6 day period. So instead of blaming whoever schedules when the games get played he's having a dig at us for respecting our fans. That or he's just being a bit of a dick and doesn't actually care about Chelsea (he's an Arsenal fan so why would he?) and is just using that as an excuse to voice his negative opinion about Liverpool.

If you run through the sheer number it's quite depressing:

Torres - £50m: I obviously want him to do well, but for that amount and for the returns he's given us, he's a failure. Opportunity cost of how we could have spent that money elsewhere too.
Luiz - £23m: Success I think. I'm convinced he's going to be an incredible centre back, although I think he's close already.
Mata - £23m: Overwhelming success. The only player we have who can actually create something. Where we'd be without him, mercy me.
Meireles - £11m: The point in signing him? Complete waste of money - it's these signings that have fucked us, where we could have put someone young in.
Lukaku - £17m: He's built like a wardrobe, but sadly also has the footballing ability of one.
Oriol - £6m: Seemed fine - not being played anymore. God knows.
Courtois - £7m: Outstanding young keeper. Should be number one in c.2-3 years.
Cahill - £7m: Better than I thought, but not top class.
De Bruyne - £7m: If this kid doesn't come into our team next season I'm going to flip out.
Benayoun - £5.5m: The point in signing him? Waste of money.
Kalas - £5.5m: Fuck knows. Seems a bit small to play centre back to me.
Ramires - £17m: Absurd athlete - is he a good enough footballer? I love him, but I'm questioning his value.

I make that close to £180m. What have we got to show for it? You have to actually spell it out to just recognise how much money we've spent.

Next season I think we have KDB to fill a gap in centre midfield for sure. That's one of about three or four midfielders we need. 

We need a much better strategy. At the moment we're just pissing money up the wall. Let a manager build a team - it's really as simple as that.

Firstly he lumps all tax minimisation together as bad, by highlighting people that pay no tax and pretending he's just noticed it. Tax minimisation through the charitable allowance is actually probably better than paying tax in many cases as the money gets directed efficiently to people who spend it effectively on very important issues in the community. This isn't avoidance that benefits the rich, it makes little difference to them other than the government is taking their money instead of the charity receiving it, but the statement implies that cutting will be a crackdown towards the rich paying more or having lower income of which it is neither, it's just cutting the funding that charities receive from the tax revenues.

It's also a subtle swipe at Labour timed perfectly for the upcoming elections, reminding the public that this was allowed under their watch and he intends to sort it out. In fact I expect he will state the Tax received will have risen under Tories, which is only likely to because of they are taking the charity money.
The idea of bringing the tax rate down for some to gain competitiveness and up for those avoiding implies that it's fair trade off, when it's not really a trade-off at all.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"You have some players out of position. Mikel cant really do anything at the right side of midfield and Frank can either play LAM or as a central midfielder.

In my opinion this is our strongest 11:

------------Cech--------------

Ivanovic--Luiz/Cahill--Terry--Cole

--Ramires----Romeu--(Revolving role)-


--------------Mata----------

-----Torres--------Kalou-----

or 

-----Sturridge----Drogba-----


Defense: 
Ivanovic, Luiz or Cahill , Terry and Cole.

Ivanovic is our best RB. Luiz and Cahill depending on what kind of team we are going to play and Cole over Bertrand against strong teams because of his experience, otherwise Bertrand is not half bad.

Midfield :

Romeu is our most impressive defensive midfielder. His contract with Barcelona was a huge fuck up which is the reason there are so many problems of him not playing. We will see the best of him when the contract with Barca runs out. Another reason to hate those royal assholes.

Ramires is our best option in the right side of midfield. The left midfield spot should be alloted to Meireles, Lampard or Essien depending on the tactics and their form.

Mata easily with the free roaming role and the play maker. 

Forwards: 

Sturridge and Drogba can play better together than Sturridge and Torres because Sturridge does try to pass more to Drogba but when you put him along side Torres he tries to play his own game.

Kalou is more open to pass to Torres. They both play better together.

I'd also like to see Lukaku start to feature but it is unlikely because of the immense fixtures coming up. He is going out on loan for sure.",0,1334055942,null,0,false,0,c4aiprd,t3_s2clg,t1_c4aiprd,t3_s2clg,null,1428690989,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

AVB pushed too hard to switch from old ways and got burned for it. RDM isn't doing it, I like that we're on a good run of form, but he's relying on our traditional players too much.

You mentioned Lukaku and I think he's a great example. The guy was a freight train at Anderlecht and has the ability to just blow past players. People call him the next Didier Drogba. He's 18 years old and loves Chelsea. We've seen him play, what, twice? We put Drogba and Torres up front for 20 minutes every odd match - why aren't we working in this new talent?

Now we're in a shitty situation to rear our young talent next to our greatest players. Why? Because they're getting fucking old and are going to retire or leave soon.

As much as it pains me to say it - look at Manchester United and how they've managed to bring young players in. Phil Jones, Jonny Evans, and Danny Wellbeck have been great this season. They've got something like 5 players out on loan and a few U20 players on the bench or in the reserves who I'm willing to be are going to a) get playtime over the summer on tour like most young players at MU did last year, or b) be returned from loan and are going to be put on the first team in the 12/13 season.

We've got the young talent and the team to help nurture players, we just aren't.

As for forwards Jerome and Crouch need to be given more time together, something with Walters is not clicking, Crouch is always there for set pieces. We need him and Huth in the 18 yard box for every set piece. Jerome is needed for his pace and skill, if he gets to work on his finishing over the summer then he’d be a machine for us :)

The Tory led coalition is being far more anti-rich than Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, or the two Scottish chancellors ever were.
