We ditched Pav, with the figures in the press giving us a net of around £5.5m (£7.5m in, £2m out).  Saha's recent form is obviously crap, but if the move is viewed as a straight swap for Pavlyuchenko, he's likely to yield similar numbers given what little time he'll see on the pitch.  The money recouped from Pav should help us to lock up Luka, and if things look right, Ade.

The Nelsen move, should it happen, strikes me as similar.  Bassong has barely played and has wanted out for some time.  I doubt Nelsen would play much, but he gives us cover and can't be rated too much differently from Bassong.

I can't help but think that today's moves are with next season in mind.  The loans we doled out are the most telling.  Corluka, Bassong and Pienaar will each get first team football, work into shape, and leave us options to unload them in summer.  The table suggests that, of the Ar*e, Chelsea and Liverpool, only one of them can make the CL (imagine saying that four years ago, wow).  In the meantime, we'll have a crack at the title and should lock up a CL spot barring a serious collapse.  We'll be in one of the most attractive positions we've been in for quite some time for summer signings, and management may have set us up with some room to breathe if the clubs taking our loanees want them permanently.

true,danfeen,flair8,,"A little dramatic perhaps. What makes you think Walker will be out for a few games? In my opinion Kaboul was very good at right back when he's played there, fast and powerful going forward and solid at the back.

I think the Saha/Pavlyuchenko deals will prove to be smart ones. Pav was never going to give any effort for us any more, as he hasn't been for a while (barring the Sunderland goal) and had no chance of starting. Saha offers a lot more when he plays giving pace and power up front and a whole lot more movement that Pav, yes he is very injury prone but as with Pav, will be there for cover and as a sub rather than first team. With the Saha deal being a loan, that means we will almost certainly spend big on a striker in the summer, Damiao anyone? 

While it seems strange on the surface, the Bassong/Nelson deal might be a decent one too. Bassong the same as Pav, had no chance of a game, going on loan puts him in the shop window and will be sold in the summer. Nelson will probably barely feature for us, but if needs be, he is a decent and very experienced CB. He has also only been signed until the summer, at which time the very promising Steven Caulker comes back from loan at Swansea and will be gradually worked into the team.

It's not all doom and gloom! COYS!

true,eternalrival,lfc55,null,"I thought the first half was fairly even.  Jay Spearing was getting forward a bit too much for me and Charlie Adam's yellow card was caused by our midfield being terribly out of shape, discipline and balance during that spell.  But in the second half I thought as we took more and more control of the game, particularly in the five to ten minutes after our first goal, Wolves fell apart.  I personally don't think Charlie Adam is the ideal central midfield partner to Lucas or Spearing but he has some real talent.  He is not very efficient and his belligerent long passes seem to disrupt the flow of our game sometimes.  But he can really hit them well so good on him.  It is a travesty that we never got to see a midfield two of Lucas and Henderson, but I can live with waiting until next season.  It was really good to see Andy Carroll play well and with confidence.  His goal was a tricky piece of work and he earned it.  Movement is the key for him.  He has the size and physicality to trouble any defender.  But if he is running hard he can be a force.  Glen Johnson did not have a great game but Kuyt and particularly Henderson exposed him badly a few times.  That has to addressed before we play Spurs on Monday.  Enrique was good and Spearing settled into a good performance.  Bellamy, Skrtel and Agger need very little mention as they have been solid of late.  I thought Agger's yellow was harsh, though.  Kuyt continued his good run of form.  His touch is rarely excellent, he gets caught offside a fair bit and he gives the ball away but his movement is class and he always looks like he knows what everyone else is doing.  It feels like we might be building some momentum going into Monday.  It would be great to get them as they have a three match winning streak against us at the moment.

 31 January 2012 Last updated at 15:33 ET Former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin has had his knighthood removed.

 Mr Goodwin, who was heavily criticised over his role in the bank's near-collapse in 2008, was given the honour by the Labour government in 2004.

 There had been a growing clamour for Mr Goodwin to be stripped of his honour following thousands of job losses at RBS and in the banking industry since then, and the impact on the wider economy.

 The decisions - first to give him a knighthood and then to remove it - were, primarily, political decisions.

 Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Tuesday's announcement was the ""Right decision"" while Chancellor George Osborne described the decision as ""Appropriate"".

 Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said it was the ""Correct decision"", since the knighthood ""Was for services to banking which could not therefore be sustained"".

 End Quote James Hardy IHS Jane's Defence Weekly A spokesman for the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium told the BBC they were disappointed, but stressed that the decision was not final and negotiations were still going on.

 ""However, we respect the decision of the Indian MoD. With the Eurofighter Typhoon, we offered the Indian Air Force the most modern combat aircraft available,"" he said.

 ""Based on the Indian government feedback, we will now carefully analyse and evaluate this situation together with our European partner companies and their respective governments.""

 He says various reasons were in play in the Indian decision, including diversifying from Russian hardware and contractual problems with other bidders.

 Indian Defence Minister AK Antony had earlier cautioned that this remained a ""Long process"" and that no deal would be signed before the end of March.

 One Indian defence ministry source confirmed to Reuters that the Rafale had been ""Much cheaper unit-wise"", adding: ""Moreover, the Indian air force, which is well-equipped with French fighters, is favouring the French.""

Far more prominence should be given to the culture that awarded Fred this honour in the first place.

But they're not doing that - the status quo is in fact maintained, and Fred becomes the scapegoat. We could argue that he's fairly the scapegoat, but still he was operating in the parameters of the industry. We need to adjust those parameters.

It's weird though because AVB came to this club with a strong philosophy towards motivation within the squad, but it looks like it's had the opposite effect.

If we can get anything close to the full 27 points from those matches (I'd say 23+ would be tremendous and not unrealistic), we should be on our way, especially with Chelsea coming to Anfield the week after Norwich. 

Our problem over the last few years has been matches against lesser competition. Over those 9 matches, only the trips to Newcastle and Norwich (and maybe QPR) might give us problems. If we can maintain the level of performance, commitment, and professionalism we showed today, there's no reason why we can't win every single one of those matches. I know it's unrealistic, but crazier things have happened.

 On the one hand, pointing out yet again how important a role Alan Turing played in twentieth century affairs, and how large his legacy looms into the twenty-first, seems almost unnecessary now that we are in the midst of the Alan Turing Year.

 I don't know how many times I have now seen a news item or a blog post about the fact that there is an Alan Turing postage stamp.

 I have nothing against the postage stamp - he certainly deserves it - but the repetition of this fact at the expense of anything else that might be said about him is a symptom of the fact that Turing may, if we are not careful, end up too much a symbol and too little an actual human being.

 Here's a person who discovered the most important thing in logic and he invented the concept of the stored program computer and he did these wonderful things in biology and cryptology and started artificial intelligence and ran marathons and rode bicycles and had these terrible sexual problems, but I don't know anything about this person here's the key figure of our century, but I don't know him and I wish I did.

 So Minsky's comment portrays Turing's legacy in its appropriate scale, but at the same time it provokes the same reaction in us that Minsky is having himself: we want to know the man, the real guy.

 For people in either of those categories, The Strange Life and Death of Dr. Turing is conveniently available on YouTube.

 Now zip forward to the present day and, like I say, sharing has somehow got all out of whack.

 For God's sake don't ask them to share anything.

 Not sharing money or bison meat, but personal information.

 Increasingly, I stumble across apps and services that expect me to automatically share my every waking action on Facebook and Twitter.

 I'm all for sharing thoughts, no matter how banal.

 When sharing becomes automated, I get the heebie-jeebies.

Basically - she's Bella to Moffat's Twilight. I bloody HATE that character (Not the actress) SO much, it bloody HURTS.

We haven't had a no-nonsense manager since Jose and this team was build around his tactics, his philosophy and his style of play. Between Jose up till recently, our style have not changed much and neither have the starting line up. Much of the characters AVB is dealing with now are remnants of Jose's team, players who new comers look up to and listen to. That plus our aging squad and senior players must not be ideal for a manager like AVB. 


Chelsea is no longer a project. AVB is the kind of manager fit for a project much like how Jose fit 2004 Chelsea. Give AVB time and he will mold his own version of Chelsea and succeed with maybe only Cech, Cole and Terry left in the squad from Jose days.


Part of me want AVB to succeed and become a Fergie/Arsene figure at Chelsea but part of me also want Hiddink/Jose to come back so we wont have back to back trophy-less seasons.

So that's £40-60 for the cigs, £15ish for the tobacco and papers/filters etc and another £10-20 for booze.  £65-95 a week in stuff they could probably cut down on right there.  I'm feeding a household of between seven and eight on a lot less than £240/week, and that includes four smokers.  I've got no clue how they are managing to spend £90/week on the 'other outgoings'.  When all four of our kids were at school we weren't spending that amount a week on them, even when I was working, new trousers/skirts/shoes two or three times a year and maybe another £20 a month for trips etc.  We still managed to provide xmas and birthday presents as well, even if it meant we didn't get anything for each other.

That list of weekly expense looks more like a list of justifications than a list of necessities.  Try going from a combined income of over £50k a year to £20k and see what belt tightening feels like.

EDIT:  Here's what my weekly budget looks like:

*Four Kids, two at college, two unemployed.*

**Income**
Housing Benefit: £95 (Local housing association)

Child Tax Credits: £55

Wife's Incapacity Benefit: £90

Wife's DLA: £50 

Carers Allowance: £55

Income Support: £25

*Total: £370*

**Outgoings**
Phone + Internet: £10-20
 
Electricity: £45

Gas: £25

Tobacco: £60 (Four 50g pouches of tobacco + filters &amp; papers)

Diesel: £20

Mobiles: £10

Rent: £95

Food: £100-£120

*Total: £365-375*

We spend shit-all on 'entertainment' apart from the internet, and none of us drink.  I'm sure as-shit not complaining, we do pretty well on ~£20k a year.  Yeah, sometimes we can't afford to run the heating all day, and  eat an awful lot of pasta and Tesco Value food, and it'd be *nice* to have a can of cider every now and then, a takeout, or a proper ciggy rather than a roll-up, but at the end of the day we have a roof, and a  reasonable standard of living.  Up until 2003 we both worked, and from 2006 I've been a full time carer.  We've seen our income go from £50k, to £35k to £20k and each time we've figured out where we could trim the budget.  Take-outs went first, and xmas presents got a lot less expensive.  The wife's health stopped the social life the same time she left work, and we stopped smoking proper ciggies a while back when they went over £4.50 a pack.  We sold our house in 2006 moved to a cheaper area and rented whilst we lived off our saving for two years before starting to claim things like Income Support and Housing Benefit/Council Tax benefit.",0,1328102715,null,0,true,0,c3msp8i,t3_p62ja,t1_c3msp8i,t3_p62ja,null,1428277037,76,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,76

This is mainly because of the lack of service he's getting, in the first half, he basically played as a striker but nobody gave him the ball, he touched it something like 9 times. So in the second half he started coming deeper to get the ball, which seems to be what happens most games.

As you can see, the Tories didn't win in these places either, don't act as if it's some phenomenon exclusively limited to the Scots. Should Yorkshire succeed from the union just because they have a government they didn't vote for?

You'll also note that Scotland voted Labour (and Lib Dem), not SNP.

We payed a fortune for Lukaku and not used him at all, 10 minutes off the bench isn't enough. We have had Malouda being dreadful all season but against Swansea he didn't try Piazon. Those are decisions I simply do not understand. Get the young, hungry players in if the old ones are not doing the job. At the very least it'll make the old ones realise they MUST perform to be apart of the squad.

I know this is a transition year, so transition. Just dump players that don't want to play and know they're leaving. I'm not bothered if we end up 5th as a result, the response will be quicker to achieve. Get Chalobah a game, why is McEachran not in the first team squad getting chances (I know he's now on loan, don't worry)? It's all a bit weak from AVB so far.

Also, we've just signed Cahill. Then play him! It's ridiculous to just leave him on the bench constantly when he could be given a chance in the team. We've looked so poor in defence all season, playing him now will only integrate him faster.

He's a little bit like Xavi, in a way. Excellent midfielder, passes like crazy. He's not very attack-minded (he still scores from time to time, though), his role is mainly about supporting the other midfielders and starting plays (we call that ""volante central"" here in southamerica, don't know the english name for that).

Benefits helped my family. They help many families. And any adjustment needs to be debated thoroughly. But when benefits are abused, or just taken for granted, then we have problems. This family in the article was not a good example for this debate.

As I read the article, I was feeling sorry for the family used as an example. But the more I read, the more I got angry at the family. Benefits are there to be used responsibly, to help you get back on your feet, or to lift you above the poverty line. That family aren't helping themselves at all.

I want to compare 'Raymond's' family's existence with that of my own, as we lived in similar circumstances.

As some context, my parents also brought up 6 children in one house, on an estate in an industrial English town. My mum didn't work, and my dad had a job that at its max paid c£23,000. We lived within our means, but that meant giving up luxuries like having a TV. My parents kept meticulous accounts, knowing exactly what budget we had to spend on food for the week ( for example, it was a luxury that we could have cheese 1 day a week). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't comfortable by any means.


&gt;The family receive a total of £30,284.80 a year in benefits - well over the £26,000 cap proposed by the government

Ok, so I don't know the comparison of today's money compared to a decade ago, but I still know several families nowadays who live on considerably less than £26,000.

&gt;Raymond, a former educational software writer, has been jobless since 2001...
Says Ray: ""The market for my skills dried up 10 years ago - there's a total lack of work in my area of expertise.""

In a decade he hasn't done any retraining? When my dad got made redundant from his main job, he took any job that was going to keep food on the table, even working in a warehouse (he was an office worker generally)

&gt;Other: £91

&gt;'There are four children to supply school uniforms - including gym kits - each year. The school trips aren't days out to Alton Towers - they're educational trips for several of the courses, like history, geography and media studies, that the school tells us will form an important part of their course. Then there are seven birthdays a year, and seven children to make Christmas happen for each year.'

Each year, I wore hand-me-downs from my elder siblings. In year 7 I remember getting a new school blazer! My mum got one several sizes too big and I wore it for the next 5 years. We didn't go on any school trips unless the school was able to help with the cost. Birthdays and Christmas were tight for 8 people and we didn't splash out.

&gt;Sky TV £15

&gt;'We get the Sky Movies package because we're stuck in the house all week - otherwise we wouldn't have any entertainment.'

What the fuck! Make your own goddamn entertainment. Read a book, go for a walk, talk to each other. I'm not complaining about paying for internet, but TV, and Sky on top of that? It's fucking ridiculous.

&gt;Mobiles: £32

&gt;My wife and I have mobile phones, and so do all of the teenage children. You try telling teenagers they're going to have to do without their mobiles and there'll be hell to pay.'

Maybe try telling your children what to do with some authority then. Maybe a shared phone for emergencies, but for children?

&gt;Weekly shopping: £240

&gt;Includes food and household goods, 24cans of lager, 200 cigarettes and a large
pouch of tobacco... 'On the cigarettes, my wife tried to give up, but she missed one appointment on the course and they threw her off it.'

For fuck's sake. Give up buying alcohol, give up smoking (which you can do without a course, strangely enough). And maybe, just maybe, try using a budget and sticking to it.

&gt;I see eight people here having to choose between eating or heating

No you don't. You see 2 irresponsible people choosing entertainment and comfort over basic needs. And I'm still including the internet as a basic need.

While your benefits seem fine and justified, Raymond's don't.

These people have more money and entertainment than me so god knows how hard working low income families feel.

Doesn't that just come back to the Olympics generally being an uneconomic mess? Most people don't even watch it. At best a few will tune in for the 100m and maybe the rowing because we win that one.

Most of the complaints about advertising are the restrictions on free speech in general surrounding the Olympics. There are laws in place that allow police to enter homes and remove any signs, political or commercial. That is surrendering vital freedoms for something utterly irrelevant.

&gt; This legislation prevents unauthorised use of certain ‘listed expressions’, which could suggest an association – for example, seemingly innocuous phrases like ‘summer 2012’ and ‘London 2012’.

The whole idea that you can breach IP laws by stating either term is absurd. It shows that IP has massively overreached itself. If the Olympics can't sell its brand for £100m without silly laws then sell it for less than £100m.

 As for Lukaku, I like his strength and he fits better into a system heavy on crosses and long balls, which we fall back on when our ""creativity"" fails. However, I question his ability to operate against a team like Man U. At this point though I'd be willing to try it.

A possible fix for the Bosingwa problem is to throw Cahill in the middle and slot David Luiz in at left back. He likes marauding up in the attack anyway, why not put him in a location where he can do that freely?

true,keizersozei,flair5,,"I don't know why any of the Spurs blogs haven't picked up on it yet (that I know of), but don't the past 2 transfer window dealings show quite how much Levy is bracing the club for Redknapp's departure this Summer?

Although the 3 signings have greatly improved our starting 11, we spent very little in last Summer. The only reason we managed to borrow Adebayor was because City had to reduce their wage bill to adhere to the FIFA financial fair play rules. A conservative estimate would save City around £5m for the year. Our new manager can decide in the summer if he really wants to take Adebayor full time or search elsewhere.

In Bassong and Pav, we had a couple of players who were good enought to warm the bench at the very least, but weren't even getting that honor at the best of times. Due to their raitings when they came to Spurs, I doubt they were on a small wages. They definately have sell on value - but their stock has been falling steadily over the last season or two (due to lack of playing time). 

So for Pav, a straight sale (thought to be £8mish) - to replace him with Saha (free). Pav did have a tendency to come in from the cold and score for us but was clearly a 4th choice striker and wasn't happy about it. Saha surely isn't under any illusions. Pienaar I'll get to in a minute.

Bassong goes on loan, but with the clear intention of a sale at the end of the season for anyone who wants to pay good money for him. He's still young, an automatic international, and has plenty of Prem experience. I thought he did a good job for us when he played regularly, but definately looks suspect when lacking match fitness or coming on as a sub - and clearly doesn't like playing second fiddle. Ryan Nelson has a boat full of experience (Captain of NZ at 2010 WC) and is again used to warming the bench.

With both signings (or swaps) we've brought in experience as cover, rather than players who are at the peak of their careers (age-wise). Definately made profit/saved money in the process. More importantly IMO is the fact that we CAN get rid of them both in the summer with no losses to incur. The new manager can decide whether he wants to extend/terminate their stay, and either option won't cost us a penny. The manager can also use the funds from the sales for his own purchases. Lets not forget that Bayor will probably leave us in the summer

Because we didn't manage to offload Gio, we had Kranjcar, Pienaar, and Dos Santos as our backup for the attacking midfield. Letting Pienaar go instead might be a blessing in disguise, as Gio is certainly a more direct player.

In conclusion, ""ahem"" I think Levy is setting it up nicely for the new manager to come in in the summer and make some big-ish signings of his own. I don't think its unrealistic to think that we will make a marquee signing in the CF, if not also the CB dept. 

Hopefully Mourino will be as good at buying players for Spurs as Harry was.

true,joealarson,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"So I had a thought with the meta-Who that went like this:

Before the Fields of Trenzalore the Doctor defeats the Silence once and for all, wiping them from existence. This is accomplished through the aid of a character who, like the silence, can not be remembered when (s)he's unseen. This character finds out about the universe reboot and embarks on a plan to trick the whole population of the silence on to the TARDIS and blow it up with them inside it, then they would not be brought back because they can not be remembered and they'd be stuck on the other side of the rift. It's this character's voice River hears in the TARDIS say ""Silence will fall"" during a fight that's happening just outside her view and she's actually the one who rigged the TARDIS to blow (hence the ""I'm sorry, my love."")

Then, come to Fields of Trenzalore. The Doctor's been avoiding it, didn't even know where it was, but he finds himself there, and discovers the truth muguffin. The episode is spotty. Bad writing, occasionally inconstant acting. It's not really bad but Matt and Alex just seem off their game. Finally someone innocently asks ""Doctor Who?"" and then the end of the episode. 

Next up is the triumphant return of Doctor Who Confidential (normally I don't watch it, but in this case...) and we see the last minutes of filming the episode. ""Cut"" and everyone is OOC, walking off the set, and the interviews start. ""We really don't know where we're going with this one"" admits the writers and directors over and over again. ""We set this whole thing up kinda hoping the ending would write itself. The story's just flowed up to this point like it always does but this is the worst case of mass writers block. No one has anything."" ""How do you answer that? Why did we even ask it?"" ""If we can't come up with something the show may be on permanent hiatus... why did we do that?"" The whole time Alex Kingston and Matt Smith keep hearing voices that don't make any sense interrupting their interviews.

Suddenly Matt does a take and he's... weirder than usual. Disoriented, confused, surprised that his sonic screwdriver is just a prop, well of course it's just a prop here. The Doctor has breached our reality and is the only one who can save the show. River too inhabits Alex, but their grip is tenuous and intermittent. They go to the writers and say they must not write the Trenzalore episode. They've already written it. They go to the director and says they must not film it. ""What? You mean the show we just wrapped up?"" ""Then we must not air it."" ""We can't stop it now, it's the season cliff hanger.""

Then they discover that while they've filmed the climax, but not some of the preceding scenes. Shows are often filmed out of order, perhaps if they can insert something into the earlier scenes they can use that to leverage a win from this, something they can hold on to. Doctor/Matt and River/Alex do some quick rewrites, a little adlibing, we see Moffat turn to the camera and say ""Matt's just not bringing his A-game today"" but when Moffat say's they'll need to reshoot the scene Doctor/Matt insists it was perfect and that they move on. ""If we're going to save the universe... I mean the show, we have to do the next scene.""

Then fucking move. Why is it that some people seem to think that they're entitled to not have to do what others do to make a living.

&gt;A 10-years out of work person with niche skills from a remote area may very well honestly struggle to find work.

10 years is enough time to develop a niche skill into a more general skill. If the guy actually did this job, he's not an idiot. Stop making excuses for him as though he's some kind of naive retard or unfortunate imbecile.

&gt;except to point out how great the unknowns are

What great unknowns?

This couple spend £50 quid on smokes, £15 quid on tobacco, a tenner at least on beer (£75 in total). Another £15 for SKY movies. AND money on mobile phones for their fucking KIDS.

Here's what I know. That's over £400 a month on luxuries, not necessities. Here's also what I know; my local college offers fucking hundreds of courses that only cost £100-200 a pop. These are 10-20 week courses in everything from tourism fucking management to photoshop design.

These courses are also tailored to beginner, intermediate and advanced individuals.

Maybe if he put his cigarette out, his can of beer down, and turned off the fucking television, he could spend some of that £400 a month he tosses off on some skills that would get him a fucking job.

Yes, they are in two different courts. But that doesn't mean that they can't be tried in both. Just like in the states, you can be tried in Criminal for the public charges against you, AND you can be sued as well. Remember OJ?

From what I've been hearing, the FA is to make a decision or make some type of ruling against Terry AFTER the criminal case. Now, here comes the stupid issue I have. No way any regular bloke off the street is going to get a delayed trial for more than 5 months. The fact that it's been delayed for the purpose of the Euro is disgusting. Because they've decided to postpone the criminal charges, you are thus postponing any pending FA charges.

I wish Liverpool were able to choose when they wanted to start Suarez's suspension.

As to why Suarez wasn't punished criminally for his actions, I really can't tell you. It would have been better because we would have had a trial that would have had no substantial evidence to prosecute Suarez, thus putting the FA in a position where they couldn't find Suarez guilty. 

Personally, I would have sued the FA. That way, the charges and facts would have been brought in front of a Judicial Magistrate where we would have been given a fare and proper ruling. 

After reviewing JT's video, I would say that JT is going to have a hard time defending his case. I don't see a criminal Judge dismissing his case; any neither does anyone else, hence why the trial has been pushed back into July.

Also, many employers will give you a relocation allowance. If not, there are employers who will loan you the money to relocate at reasonable repayment rates (interest free usually).

You can also speak to the Job Centre about a possible relocation allowance.

&gt;making a formal complaint to the employer over stupid trivial issue that apparently affects ONE person is quite another.

in what other way is she supposed to voice her opinion to the bus company?

&gt;And playing the ""sexism"" card over terms of endearment does nothing but devalue REAL gender issues.

sexism isn't a real gender issue? I don't get that part, but anyway, i think calling a woman 'babe' is pretty demeaning. You don't know this woman or how she feels about being called 'babe.' It's a phrase which made a few ex-gf's of mine feel uncomfortable, because it made them feel as if they were being treated like babies. Not to mention the fact that 'babe' is usually an affectionate term reserved for a partner, and to be called it by random men when they're at work comes across as a little strange to me.  To me it's like calling a man 'kiddo', it just isn't done because it's demeaning when both parties are supposed to be equal.

&gt;Can I go complain because someone I've never met nods at me in the street and says ""alright, mate"" ?

The people who WORK FOR THE BUS COMPANY are at WORK they're not in the street, there's a difference.

&gt;This IS someone with a stick up their ass, a chip on their shoulder, too much time on their hands or however you want to refer to it.

No, this is a woman who feels (quite rightly in my opinion) that terms like 'love' and 'babe' how no place in the professional world, and should not be used to refer to random women on the bus who may or may not be happy being called this.

&gt;Gender is irrelevant

No it isn't, the whole issue here is that terms like 'babe' are pretty much exclusively used to refer to women (there are some exceptions like women calling men 'honey' etc, but these do not have the same connotations as the word 'babe' does.) I'd arge that this is a gender issue and that gender is pretty damn relevant.

&gt;if a man had made the same complaint

How would he word his complaint? What words could be used by a bus driver to refer to a man which bear derogatory connotations? The closest thing i can think of is calling a man 'son' or 'kiddo' but apart from that?

&gt;The anger here is not because she's a woman, it's because she's WRONG.

But she isn't wrong. She says she feels X, some people say it's wrong to feel X, that is not her being 'wrong', that is her receiving feedback from some members of society who feel that she is being outrageous in her request not to be called 'babe.' How dare she, after all, dislike being called 'babe'? Stupid bitch. Amirite? ",0,1328122129,null,0,false,0,c3mvw6o,t3_p65xj,t1_c3mvw6o,t1_c3mvogt,null,1428278623,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

&gt; The couple share their home with six of their children - their five-year-old son, Raymond's twin girls from his first marriage, and three of his wife's four children from an earlier relationship.

Three/four children from an earlier relationship: well that number of children isn't unusual nor is it unreasonable or irresponsible if both parents were earning decent amounts and we don't know how or why that relationship ended. Twins: well that's always going to be tricky and no-one can be blamed for two kids instead of one in that case. The only criticism I would have would be having the youngest child that was conceived well after Raymond was made redundant, but of course we can't know for sure if it was planned. A vasectomy could have gone wrong, the pill could have failed or the condom broke. There are many possibilities. Overall I don't think it's fair to 'condemn' a family on benefits simply because of the number of children without knowing the facts.

Of course there are families that willingly get bigger without considering the problems and that is irresponsible, but the blanket one-size-fits-all ""You shouldn't have had them"" doesn't work in so many cases that it's not really a valid criticism.

true,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;The banking industry didn't force the public, they may have made it easy, but they didn't force people to borrow at outrageous levels. We managed to do that all by ourselves.

Well on balance, a lot of people are told now and even more so in 2008 that it was ok to take things out on credit. If I go into a bank I expect good financial advice, there's not harm taking something on credit *if* the bank can afford to be without the money for long enough. I'm not an expert economist by any means but the way I understand the situation was that the banks could aford to offer a lot of credit because they thought they had a lot of valuable assets, which it turns out were garbage. 

At the end of the day I agree the public shouldn't get into the habit of taking things on credit especially things they do not need, but *if* they do, is it not unreasonable to expect the bank to say ""hang on a minute, you can't afford this and we're not really sure we want to run the risk?"" I'd say at the end of the day, it's really down to the bank to be refusing  particularly high risk credit rather than the public not to try if desperate.

I understand your point and agree that there are numerous cases where people have kids without giving a shit about how they'll be supported, but in this case (and similar) the retrospective ""Well no-one forced them to have kids"" doesn't really help the issue and isn't a valid criticism.

My dad, for example, had four kids ranging from 5 to 16 when he was suddenly made redundant at the age of 50. ""Well who forced you have four kids"" would have been a ridiculous response to his welfare woes, should he have had them.

ACTA procedure in EU Parliament:

- The International Trade (INTA) Committee of the European Parliament is the main committee working on ACTA.

- The Legal Affairs (JURI), Development (DEVE), Civil Liberties (LIBE) and the Industry (ITRE) committees will first vote on their opinions after holding “exchange of views” on draft reports in the coming weeks.

- Opinions will then be sent to INTA to influence its final report, which will recommend the EU Parliament as a whole to reject or accept ACTA.

- The final, plenary vote by the EU Parliament on ACTA should be held no sooner than June.

true,daveduckman,null,null,"Sorry fellow Kopites, but I just do not rate Spearing.

Don't get me wrong, he plays with his heart, he runs and runs and runs and he is the only player in the squad atm that looks like he's trained to play DM position. What's more, he's a Scouser, and that means he'll always be up for the big matches and he'll always have the passion then some players lose.

However, I just don't think he's up to scratch, even for a youngster. First off, he very short and not really physical enough to be the anchor-man/holding midfielders. Obviously Lucas isn't huge and mascherano was even smaller, but he just doesn't seem to be able to compete in the middle of the field with any strong presence. Secondly, his distribution and passing is pretty poor, sure he doesn't need to be making plays all by himself, but he always seems to want to make the easy no-progress pass backwards or sidewards instead of holding up the ball to let players make runs or finding someone forward in space. Maybe most importantly, his defensive positioning and movement is unsatisfactory for a DM. He run at the man with the ball, but he just doesn't close off spaces and stop opportunities like a good DM (and Lucas in particular) do so brilliantly. While he's still fairly young with time to improve, he's not THAT young.

As much as I would like the golden age of liverpool's defence to be robinson/kelly/flannagan/spearing, he just doesn't seem to be good enough quality. It reminds me of seeing Damian Plessis get way too much gametime a few years back, when every time he got on the field, I though 'this is a mediocre player who adds nothing, and will probably never be good enough to add anything'.

I like him in the squad for the moment, but I don't want him to stop us buying proper cover for lucas in the summer. Also, I'd like one of our high quality back line to be played as a holding midfielder (surely aurelio, coates or kelly could handle that ably).

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"Okay ... I was irritated earlier by the pomposity of your response.

So here's the serious version, as objectively as I can muster.

How can you possibly consider the word love (when used as a term of endearment) as a remark ""demeaning to women"", when the word love is COMPLETELY without gender and can be applied equally to MEN and WOMEN ?

Quite simply put, the interpretation is entirely in the mind of the recipient, and she can have no idea of the intentions of the person who delivered the remark.

She has ASSUMED that it was made as a derogatory term, and has acted without any consultation or discourse with the person who said it. It is safe to bet that she did not challenge the driver at the time, perhaps with an ""excuse me, what did you say?"", nor has she given the driver a chance to explain himself, which probably would have consisted of a simple ""no offence, I meant no harm"".

Instead she has made a formal complaint to his employer, for whatever reason, perhaps to cause trouble, perhaps to make the world a better place, who knows (although I'd lean towards the former).

And she has done this based solely on HER interpretation of what he has said, an expression that is the norm in many societies, and most definitely not in the same league as blatant racist or sexist remarks, such as your ""nigger"" reference, or indeed some of the ""stupid bitch"" comments that you have seen here.

Hence my video link, which is trying to explain had you really watched it, that making any judgement about some idle remark is ALSO dependent on you as an individual, your upbringing, your society, your religious and other views etc etc.

She thought it was sexist, he may have thought he was just been exchanging a pleasantry. You are no more in a position to definitively state ""XYZ is a sexist remark"" than I am of saying the opposite.

I'm talking about the appropriate response to the situation, some consideration for BOTH sides of the issue, and not instantly jumping on the ""sexism"" bandwagon because it's chique or politically correct to do so.

She was way over the top in her behaviour. Now please READ what I have written about understanding both sides of a situation before telling me ""I AM WRONG"".

Also, you might want to read up on hyperbole, and see how it applies to your response above.",0,1328130708,null,0,false,0,c3mxngj,t3_p65xj,t1_c3mxngj,t1_c3mvzef,null,1428279451,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It didn't make me feel comfortable in the workplace, and although we were both in the same job position, it made me feel like his assistant, or underling.

That video basically says 'it's okay for him to call you kiddo, you're an idiot for feeling shitty about it!' which we can easily extrapolite to other things. 'it's okay for him to call you babe', 'it's okay for your boss to call you babe', 'it's okay for your boss to call you coloured', 'it's okay for your boss to call you crippled' 'it's okay for her to call you a spastic', 'it's okay for them to call you a nigger' etc.

Just because a word isn't offensive to a majority of people, doesn't mean that word should just be bandied about without regards to people's feelings. I don't feel offended when my friends call my spastics. But i would never dream of calling a person in a wheelchair a spastic and then telling them 'nothing happens when you get offended!'

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;How can you possibly consider the word love (when used as a term of endearment) as a remark ""demeaning to women"", when the word love is COMPLETELY without gender and can be applied equally to MEN and WOMEN) ?

i never said the word 'love' was 'demeaning to women', you've taken two parts of my post and put them together when they were not originally. I actually said

&gt; terms like 'love' and 'babe' how no place in the professional world, and should not be used to refer to random women on the bus who may or may not be happy being called this.

the end part about 'random women on the bus' is not saying that the term is only not to be used on women, but was a reference to the woman in the news article. Getting my entire point and linking it back to the subject at hand.

&gt;Quite simply put, the interpretation is entirely in the mind of the recipient, and she can have no idea of the intentions of the person who delivered the remark.

absolutely correct. Just as the woman says in the article 'I personally find terms like ""babe"" coming from men to be over familiar, sexist and patronising.' She also says ''m not suggesting that bus drivers or other men who say babe to women they don't know are evil misogynistic women-haters', which shows she acknowledges the intent behind the words may not correlate to the word itself. However, language changes over time, and it is not the intentions that are important, but the signifier and signified itself. If you call a black man a 'nigga' and he is offended, turning around and saying 'but i meant it in a nice way, i had good intentions!' does not cut it. It is not up to you to dictate who finds what offensive, or how a woman should feel when she is called a babe etc.

&gt;She has ASSUMED that it was made as a derogatory term

No she did not. She just said it isn't appropriate. NOWHERE in the article does she say that she thinks the men were saying it to be deliberately misogynistic. She just says that she finds the words themselves 'overfamiliar, sexist and patronising.'

&gt;It is safe to bet that she did not challenge the driver at the time

I don't know whether she did or not. No one does as that information is not given by the article writer, or the bus company. But that isn't important. It is much easier and more efficient to ask the bus company to ask the drivers to stop calling women 'babe'than it is to get into an argument with every bus driver there is, driving what we can assume to be a busy bus, possibly full of people waiting to get somewhere.

&gt;Instead she has made a formal complaint to his employer, for whatever reason, perhaps to cause trouble, perhaps to make the world a better place, who knows (although I'd lean towards the former).

In the article, she herself says 'The thing I find weird is that I don't really think this is news' and talks about her puzzlement when she finds it discussed on national television. I don't think she was trying to stir up 'trouble', and i definitely don't think asking some people to mind what they say to others i causing any kind of 'trouble'.

&gt;an expression that is the norm in many societies

Yes calling women 'babe' is certainly seen as normal by many. But by many people it's seen as over familiar, patronising, demeaning, and sexist; and i'm inclined to agree with these people. It creates an air of over familiarity and superiority. Who is this person driving this bus and why does he think it's okay for him to think i'm his 'babe'? etc.

&gt;definitely not in the same league as blatant racist or sexist remarks, such as your ""nigger"" reference, or indeed some of the ""stupid bitch"" comments that you have seen here.

But it is the small, subversive sexist remarks, which are still held as acceptable as many, that are the real problem. People see obvious sexism such as 'get back to the kitchen, bitch' and condemn it, possible even patting themselves on their figurative backs for being such progressive 21st century members of society, not accepting sexism and striving for a more equal world. In the same evening this person might call someone a 'cunt' (because women and their genitals are weak amirite?) or maybe they'll slut-shame and say, about a woman they deem to be dressed revealingly, 'she's asking for it.'

&gt;which is trying to explain had you really watched it,

I've seen it quite a few times before, it gets bandied about on this site as some sort of 'end-all' argument stopper about offensiveness. It has been used by many on this site to justify racism and homophobia, as well as sexism. 

&gt;dependent on you as an individual, your upbringing, your society, your religious and other views etc etc.

Of course they are, but that doesn't make the offensiveness of a comment any less serious or any less real.

&gt;She thought it was sexist, he may have thought he was just been exchanging a pleasantry.

And a man calling someone a 'faggot' may think he's being jokey and laddish. Whereas someone else may find the word 'faggot' offensive. However, we, as a society, understand that there are certain words and phrases used by people as forms of oppression. Words like 'faggot', 'nigger', and to a lesser extent, 'babe', frequently used by men in the past to make their wives feel like less than equal. A patronising term to say the least, which many women do not find acceptable in today's world.

&gt;I'm talking about the appropriate response to the situation, some consideration for BOTH sides of the issue, and not instantly jumping on the ""sexism"" bandwagon because it's chique or politically correct to do so.

I think her response was appropriate. She let the bus company know that she didn't find it appropriate. I, however, think the backlash she received was WAY out of proportion, and as she said, was originally not 'news.' I do, however, think the backlash she received has actually made this an interesting piece of 'news', or at least a point of discussion which can get people thinking about what they say, and how it may not be acceptable to say it to everyone.

&gt;She was way over the top in her behaviour. Now please READ what I have written about understanding both sides of a situation before telling me ""I AM WRONG"".

I don't think she was over the top in her behaviour. She just spoke to the bus company. Nothing else. That is NOT over the top. You are wrong.

&gt;Also, you might want to read up on hyperbole, and see how it applies to your response above.

Please don't attempt to patronise me, especially when your first response to my post just contained a link to a hackneyed and tired youtube video, which has been consistently used on reddit to defend racism, sexism and homophobia.

&gt; The economy more or less rests on the assumption of large numbers of unemployed people.

Debatable. 

&gt; There are, to my knowledge, no options for significant retraining that do not take you out of your benefits. You stop being a jobseeker and start being a student.

That needs to be examined more closely. In this particular case it's clear that the length of time your unemployed for is a significant factor in the amount of retraining you will require.

""Spastic"" has been used extensively as a pejorative, so its offensiveness is orders of magnitude greater than ""babe"" – and ""nigger"" is just off the scale. 

When I first started work I was made quite uncomfortable by a male colleague who always called me ""love"". Being male myself I thought he must be gay or bi perhaps, but I shrugged it off and said nothing. I soon discovered that he called literally *everyone* love – that was quite common around where he grew up apparently (Sheffield I think) – so my unease was unwarranted as it turned out. The fact is that *some* terms are considered innocuous enough by most people to be cautious about siding with someone who claims it offends them. 

And where should we draw the line? Are there *no* terms of endearment or personal address that one can use in general, for fear of offending someone? I mean, I genuinely don't like being called ""sir"" so maybe I should complain the next time it happens, and try to get it stopped. 

Don't get me wrong though, I know there are some people who will use supposedly friendly terms in an unfriendly, condescending, or sexually suggestive way, but those kinds of people would find ways to do that regardless of what terms they used.

&gt;
&gt; Whenever we have a shortage of a particular type of employee it becomes something of a national emergency, requiring the government to hire from abroad. Nurses and midwives a few years ago comes to mind.

It is already a nightmare trying to find the right people for positions, because our education system isn't focused on providing the majority of people with relevant skills for working. That's why we need polytechnics and apprenticeships back. Until we face up to this we're going to be enjoying year upon year of record exam results, record youth unemployment and high immigration. 

&gt; I should preface this with me not being an expert on how the dole works, but I do know that to receive ""jobseekers"" you need to be fully available for work and actively seeking work. That means you can't be a student so any formal education is out of the question.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I don't think there is much of a case to be made for changing that, as it would increase the cost of the yearly welfare bill without actually really reducing the number of unemployed people.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"The terms are not equal in the weight that they hold, but they are equal in the way that they have all been defended with terms like 'political correctness gone mad' or 'you being offended = its offensive' etc. It's the subtle comments like 'babe' to a woman which allow a breeding ground for ignorance and sexism. I was always taught never to call a woman babe because of two reasons.

1) She isn't a pig

2) She isn't mine

I never really understood number two as i was growing up, but found number one pretty humorous. As i got older i saw how the term 'babe' has been used historically by oppressive males to patronise and belittle women and realised that the term 'babe', whilst seemingly innocent and friendly, can bear a lot of weight in regards to women who have had that term used against them in a negative way.

I think 'love' is different from 'babe' in many ways. The term 'love' has been used by my granddad for forever and a day, in every situation really. But 'babe' always has a slight kinda of sleaziness to it, i think. It's a much more patronising word than 'love', basically saying that the women is a baby. Not to mention the fact that it's a word that is usually reserved for couples, and in that regard 'babe' can come across as patronising and also superior. The whole idea of 'i'm not your significant other, but you're my babe.' The term 'babe' has more baggage associated with it than the term 'love', and in turn the term 'spastic' has more baggage than 'babe', and 'nigger' more baggage than tha, and so on. It's a matter of degrees, and although i'm not saying 'babe' is anywhere near 'nigger', i'm saying that it's the more socially accepted sexist remarks that do a lot of damage in today's society, because they're not yet seen as taboo.

&gt;And where should we draw the line? Are there no terms of endearment or personal address that one can use in general, for fear of offending someone? I mean, I genuinely don't like being called ""sir"" so maybe I should complain the next time it happens, and try to get it stopped.

Well the term 'sir' has never historically been used to oppress a sex, gender, or race. So no, i don't think that if someone claimed they were offended by the word 'sir' (when used respectfully) they will be taken seriously, because it's very hard to empathise with someone who takes offence at a word which has been used historically as a way of showing respect. If you don't like it, then it's fine to request that someone stop calling it you, but it's socially accepted that you would refer to a male as 'sir' in a respectful manner, and a woman as 'madam'. It is not accepted to call a woman 'babe' in the same way.

&gt; I also think both of our tales from work demonstrate that we perceived someone else's intent incorrectly, so I would always urge giving people the benefit of the doubt.

I would also urge giving people the benefit of the doubt, but in regards to context, i'd say that it's important to not just let someone say something and get say with it because of the context, but instead, to attempt to tell them why what they said isn't really a nice thing to say. My great-grandma (dead now but she lived to like 100 or something daft) used to affectionately tell me about her days as a child and the 'niggers' that lived near her. Now what she said was still wrong, and although the context (she was old as fuck, didn't understand why it wasn't acceptable etc) partially excused her behaviour, it did not reduce the offensiveness of the term, because it is the word which holds weight in many people's eyes, not the context.

As I understand it, there is a great deal of variability as to the degree of eyesight within the group of people defined as legally blind. It may simply mean you have very poor eyesight even with the best correction. But people who are legally blind can often read things in large print, or very close up. And even if you can only perceive light and dark, it gives a lot of useful cues to get around, particularly in a dangerous environment like a factory. It is right there in the article, 'this hereditary condition has caused his sight to deteriorate during his adult life'. Obviously one cannot deteriorate from total blindness.

&gt; No one is suggesting he should 'thrown into any job' and frankly if this guy was not blind no one would be saying his working life was over because he could not be a masseur. In fact we would utterly scoff, as in the example of someone who has a history of arts degree only wanting to work as a museum curator...

I agree that he shouldn't consider his working life over. The issue is that he was using this as temporary support in order to train himself up for an appropriate career, which was then blocked off, through no fault of his own. If you remove this scheme, you must replace it with something which is essentially equivalent. It is a general point with people with disabilities that they can excel if placed in the right environment, but will flounder if put into an unsuitable set-up without support. It is manifestly absurd to say that people who are blind should go onto JSA, and compete with everyone else for cleaning, driving and temporary office work. To be honest, this all plays into the generally rubbish nature of the jobseekers system in the country. It is actually absurd to expect a tell an expensively educated successful university graduate to do any job they can get their hands on. The whole system needs to be restructured to be much more long term, training people up to meet their abilities and talents, and the demand within the job market.

In my last company we had two blind people working, one answered the phones and was a really lovely girl who I still keep in touch with, the other was a computer programmer who was in a wheelchair who looked after our website. We had to work around things like design with a designer who could see what things looked like, but he was really good with perl (and later other things after I left so I'm told), although I don't keep in touch with him.

I guess what I'm saying is that being arthritic can really affect your ability to work, but being blind while possibly restricting your road haulage career shouldn't stop you from working. However, being able to work is not the same as finding someone who's willing to accommodate your disabilities, and in my experience (my brother was a cunt for this) it's possible for any employer to come up with reasons not to employ a blind person that have nothing to do with their disability. I fought for Angela (the receptionist) on the grounds that if she was answering phones and dealing with faxes, aside from braille keyboards there was nothing serious, but the programmer I believe had his manager tell my brother he was simply the absolute best guy for the job, to which my brother supposedly replied, ""He's fucking blind, how will he know what a website looks like?"".

Raymond is living in a part of Egypt known as denial. There's a massive booming business in writing educational applications for phones and tablet devices. There's money to be had porting textbooks to iPads and Kindles. There's even money to be made making educational websites for specific niches. If he thinks that his skills are dried up, then surely he must think no-one wants to learn anything anymore, or maybe it's just him.

When I saw the costs of booze and fags I can see how some people might get upset, but I wouldn't begrudge the opportunity for people to have a beer or a smoke now and then. I think it's a lot, and yes they could do without or at least cut down but when you're long term unemployed there needs to be something that allows you to at least celebrate the few things you might have in life or feel more human. It's one of the main reasons I oppose minimum pricing (and the smoking ban) as it affects the poor the most.

My complaint against the proposed plan is that it's national and not regional. I always felt that a 26k limit penalises those living in fulham or my own surrey on benefits, but allows those living in places such as liverpool or bradford to still claim benefits way in excess of a living wage. Realistically we need to stimulate the creation of new jobs by stimulating the creation of small businesses (as it is the growth of these businesses that create the most jobs) and we need to be compassionate about benefits while removing the benefits trap.

I suspect that if the government offered to pay the difference in his profits as a copywriter or writer of educational software for iOS devices in schools up to his benefits, but that the minute he went over he'd get an extra 5k limit before he pays tax that he'd find a way to make a living.",0,1328144036,null,0,false,0,c3n06bd,t3_p62ja,t1_c3n06bd,t3_p62ja,null,1428280640,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

First, the bad: Ream's past season in MLS was rough. He made a bunch of stupid mistakes; his positioning was tentative, and he's neither particularly pacy nor particularly strong.

Now, the good, and there's plenty of it: Ream's 24, but he's got PLENTY of upside. He's extremely comfortable on the ball, and his distribution from the back is top-notch. He seems like a classic ""confidence"" player a la Michael Carrick whose mental states form a feedback loop with his performance. That is, he's brilliant when he's on and his comfort level is high, and quite dismal when he's off. I think much of his struggle this past year had to do with the Red Bulls' more or less poisonous locker room atmosphere created by the presence of one Rafa Marquez (bastard). Given OC's ability to motivate players, I think Bolton's locker room ought to be better for him. In general, he's a very savvy player. He reads the game exceptionally well and his positional sense is generally quite good.

The rest of your comment suggests that whilst you may have read my previous comments you aren't really engaging in them. 

As for...

&gt;It is actually absurd to expect a tell an expensively educated successful university graduate to do any job they can get their hands on.

No it is not - there are either jobs that are relevant to their degree or they have acquired skills whilst learning that are transferable. If this is not the case they actually have wasted everyone's time and money - however not really relevant.

&gt;As I understand it, there is a great deal of variability as to the degree of eyesight within the group of people defined as legally blind. It may simply mean you have very poor eyesight even with the best correction. But people who are legally blind can often read things in large print, or very close up. And even if you can only perceive light and dark, it gives a lot of useful cues to get around, particularly in a dangerous environment like a factory. It is right there in the article, 'this hereditary condition has caused his sight to deteriorate during his adult life'. Obviously one cannot deteriorate from total blindness.

I am not an idiot and see my other comments - I suspect I know rather more about this topic than you do and I am well aware of what you are saying here. What has this to do with this specific case?

&gt;Disabled people are an extreme example of the general incompetence of the system, but they are also in a particularly vulnerable situation, and need to be protected until someone gets their act together and makes the system fit for purpose.

Why are you telling me this? See my remarks concerning the social model of disability.

true,tgjer,davison,Davison,"Back in the day, the rule as I understand it was ""No sex on the TARDIS."" 

To keep the censors off their backs the Doctor had to officially be strictly platonic with companions. That didn't stop subtext, but nothing official. When Peter Davison started as the Fifth Doctor I know they got stricter, since he was so young looking. Male companions were brought in so the Doctor would have someone to interact with casually, since it was pretty much no-physical-contact with women. And this was the 80's, so same-gender pairings were ignored entirely.

In the old series and spin-off media there was sometimes an assumption that Time Lords are asexual. Some of the spin-off media claimed they reproduced via genetic looms, and there was a lot of resistance to the idea that the Doctor or any Time Lords ever have sex at all.

But the actors and writers have thought the *""The Doctor NEVER gets laid""* was silly for a long time. Tom Baker and Lalla Ward (Romana) flirted on screen before getting (briefly) married IRL. Davison played up the flirtation with the Doctor and Nyssa. And Moffat posted [**his thoughts on the Doctor's sex life**](https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.drwho/browse_thread/thread/c5d105603a51785/f4860ccc178ed0fe#f4860ccc178ed0fe) on rec.arts.doctorwho back in 1995.

Now I think it's pretty canon the Doctor at least has romantic/sexual feelings for some companions. Rose definitely. He also married/deflowered Queen Elizabeth I, ""danced"" with Madame de Pompadour, would have done Astrid if she hadn't died so fast, kisses/marries/presumably has sex with River, etc. 

And his relationship with the TARDIS seems pretty definitively non-platonic these days, as does his relationship with the Master. He's married to the Blue Box (and River, but married to the Box longer), and the Master is the crazy ex-boyfriend he still obviously loves even though he's batshit crazy.",0,1328145787,null,0,false,0,c3n0g0j,t3_p5lnt,t1_c3n0g0j,t3_p5lnt,null,1428280768,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The Master's new body wasn't a normal regeneration, it was something he custom built but which got fucked up when Lucy interrupted the process. He's given himself crazy powers before, it didn't seem too implausible that he'd do it again.

And 10 was more self-absorbed than other regenerations, more intensely focused on his own particular regeneration, but I thought that made sense for him. Nine had only a brief ""life,"" ending in sacrifice. Nine's whole world was defined by his status as Time War Survivor. 10's was about building his new life, but because he's the Doctor no aspect of his life stays stable for long except the TARDIS.

I don't know where I first heard it, but I like the idea of the Doctor's regenerations as basically being an instant death + reincarnation, without the inconvenience of being a baby again.  His consciousness continues, and carries many traits and feelings with it, but the man he was dies. 

And his new personality reflects the conditions that led to the death of his previous regeneration. Nine was so willing to sacrifice himself he was practically suicidal at times. He was the Doctor who couldn't destroy the Daleks at the expense of Earth, who chose ""coward"" over destruction even when he thought it would lead to Dalek annihilation of the universe. 10 feared death intensely, and was violent to the point of genocide if no one was around to stop him.

Benefit fraud is a non issue in the grand scheme of things, about 0.7% of welfare budget claims in 2010 were fraudulent, about 1bn. 4bn was lost in DWP admin errors which also get bundled into the 'fraud' pile, which of course makes for some lovely reporting in the media, people's eyes seem to glaze over the moment we're into billions. In 08/09 nearly 17bn went unclaimed by charities and working families though, mostly because the benefit system is a horrible mess that unfairly preys on those already in the most vulnerable situation. 

I challenge anyone who talks about benefit 'scum', and 'scroungers' to firstly, try get everything they're entitled too, and need to survive, secondly, live on such an amount, and thirdly (and most importantly) maintain this attitude that seems so prevalent, that they just need to work a bit harder, to try a bit more, to stop being so lazy.

I do agree that if money can be got from other taxes it should be (I'd personally be in favour of a land tax, proto-Marxist as I am, or the Lib Dem mansion tax seems another decent idea). But if social protection (benefits and pensions) make up 30% of the budget, and the unemployment figures go up, it's pretty clear that if cuts are going to made to the general budget they'll have to come out of benefits per person as well.

Also, the most important thing is that we get ourselves into a situation where we're growing again, because that removes the entire debt problem immediately, for everyone. So I disagree with any tax rises which stand to damage that.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Nobody ever hears about people on benefits who aren't in some way cheating the system.

I was on Job Seeker's Allowance for three years after being made redundant. I received £50 a week in exchange for proving each week that I was looking for work. In the end I was supplying so much proof every week that my advisor asked me to stop bringing the lists in.

Now I'm off benefits and back into full-time work and while it isn't glamorous, I'll be damned if I'm not clinging to it. 

However, without those payments I would never have gotten the part-time job I took to get off benefits (a part time job that paid me per month roughly £240. After travel costs I was actually worse off than I was on benefits) and without those payments I'd have never managed to keep my suit in order, pay for my net connection through which a majority of my jobhunting took place, never paid for transport to and from interviews, never enabled me to get printouts of my CV at the library, no nothing.

I never attempted to claim anything except my JSA. I got a few single-day jobs at telemarketing companies and survey firms, the Job Centre said. ""Take 'em, don't worry about it"" and I ended up with good references because of their help, as well as a temporary role in the civil service which has helped me get promoted in my current job after less than a year.

However, people never hear about experiences like mine. They never hear about the shame of climbing on a bus and riding down to the town to make your case, they never hear about sitting in a room full of people who genuinely don't care in some theoretical jobfinding course, tapping away at one of the virus-riddled computers full of bootlegged mp3s and flash games as you pillage one jobsite after another. They don't hear about the relief of making that first step or gaining the experience you need by taking a job that isn't ideal, but is a start.

People don't hear about any of that, because while many don't fancy taking a crap job now for the sake of a better job later, they also don't necessarily want to work for something that they know won't benefit them.

I go down to the course centre every few months now and give talks about how much better my life is for sacrificing a year to a company that didn't care and didn't want to know purely so I could say ""and fuck you too sir"" on my way out to a company that pays well, has a union, cares enough to pay a decent wage and has some flexibility regarding its employees, and I'll be goddamned if I'm not proud of my self sufficiency now.

Technically there is no real canon. Nobody who works on the show has ever declared an official canon. The closest we've ever gotten is the statement that what happens on the television show 'actually happened'. Besides the show itself (which I hope we can all agree is pretty much canon- though again, not uber-technically) canon is all relative and personal. I include the novels in my personal canon.

Yes we do  - doesn't matter how many we score if the ref won't give them, which is what has happened recently. These weren't just some penalties we missed out on getting. Three wrongly disallowed goals in a season is some damn bad luck - three in 10 league games is all but unprecedented.

I understand your sentiment, but it's not a non-issue, and that's before you get into sendings off that should or shouldn't have been. A single season just isn't statistically long enough to legitimately claim things will even out - this could have a huge effect on our finish.

Transfer dealings make a lot more sense when you look at it like that - this transfer window was all about keeping the mood right in the squad. You're absolutely right that Saha and Nelson aren't going to be complaining come April about not having played enough.

I think the bid for Remy shows Levy isn't necessarily holding back because he thinks we'll lose Redknapp. We've just identified appropraite targets and are willing and able to wait a little while to get them. Makes sense. I'm not entirely averse to a managerial change - Redknapp's not perfect and is a little too in love with his first XI - but I don't think or hope we'll get Mourinho.

How lovely, putting a white supremacist group on a Muslims. And I'm not sure that most politicians are happy to meet or speak with absolutely *anyone*. I doubt very much that the average MP would agree to a conference call with such groups.

Now I should make it clear that I am in no way a fan of the BNP nor do I support racism or any sort of the normal anti-equality groups, but I'm not sure I agree with anonymous completely over this:

&gt;  ""It is essential if we wish to live in a world free from oppression to expose and confront racists at their jobs, their schools, at their homes and in the streets.""

It depends, of course, if they are being racist while at work, or at school or in the street. By all means go through the proper channels in those cases, or challenge their ideas. But at their homes? How would that work - protests outside? Surely freedom of speech, which is a right that shouldn't be curtailed unless it leads to advocating (particularly in public) violence against an individual or group, is not a reality at all if such a thing is restricted in the privacy of someone's own home.

That doesn't leave a lot of resources for new comedy, and they're not exactly looking for new creative talent at the moment.

In the past, the BBC was a more hallowed institution with a stronger mission for original British content, which meant they'd be more inclined to take a risk on some of the more 'out there' ideas that the writers were coming up with.

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"&gt; Half of our current starters could end up as backups in two years.

That is really optimistic, IMO. Who do you see that being?

I can see Kelly taking over Glen's spot at RB or perhaps Agger/Skrtel if one is injured/leaves for some reason. Other than that I see Agger, Skrtel, and Enrique as still likely starters 2 years from now. Flanagan and Robinson look promising but are still a ways away from being better than Enrique and Kelly.

I could see someone taking over Downing/Kuyt/Bellamy's spot(s) in the lineup. But Suarez, Lucas, and Henderson all seem likely as starters in two years. Particularly if Henderson continues to improve. 

Gerrard very well might be a reserve player or retired by that time, so I can see his spot being open for the taking. However, Shelvey seems to be ahead of Coady or any of our other midfielders, save Spearing. 

So I see one position in the back four that is possibly open, two/one midfield spots, and one/two striker/winger spots, for a total of four open spots.

I think we have a ton of talent in the reserve and academy levels, but I think it's very ambitious to hope for more than 2-4 players to be regular contributors in two years, much less regular starters.

For example I own two pairs of jeans, one pair of trainers, a pair of boots, enough shirts/underwear/socks for the week and one winter jacket.  When the arse falls out of my jeans we shuffle the budget around a bit and I spent £10 in Primark.  The same for uniforms when we needed to buy them.  Up until last school year the kids at college were getting EMA so that paid for their bits n bobs and bus fares etc, JSA pays for the other two's needs.

We try fixing stuff before throwing it out and replacing it, even if it means a lot of gaffer tape holding stuff together, when it finally goes beyond my abilities to fix it we buy second hand. My father's xmas present to me for the last few years has been the TV license, and as for household insurance, we don't have any.  Christmas budget is less than £30 per person.  That usually means for Oct/Nov we are eating spag-bol at £5 per meal three or four times a week.

I'd guess our 'other outgoings' budget is something like £500-600 for the entire family a year. 

I'm not trying to make it sound like we're one step away from the workhouse.  We're not, we're probably in the same income range as most of my neighbours.  Sure I'd like an extra £100 a week so I could get a new PC/PS3/whatever and go out once in a while, but I don't *expect* the welfare system to pay for things like that.  I expect it to stop us from starving or freezing to death and give a reasonable quality of life, which is what we have.

They're our islands. The residents have British passports.

If Argentina does nothing, we do nothing. We don't provoke them, or take the piss.

If Argentina petitions other countries to blockade the Falklands then we can do the same to Argentina. We effectively say ""Anyone buying Argentine goods can't sell to us"", and put sanctions in place around banking in the way that the US does to other nations concerning Cuba etc. This could massacre their economy.

If Argentina attacks any British vessels or people, or invades the Falklands then its time for a full scale land invasion of Argentina. (Its 'Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me') It would be time to annex 75% of their land mass, declare it British soil. It costs money to go to war, so the Argentinian land would be payment if they started it. At that point its our land until a larger, more powerful nation with a bigger army decides it wants it, at which points its tough shit.

This may at least also shut the Spanish up about Gibraltar.

Having said all that, nothing against the Argentinians; watched Uruguay vs Ghana with a few of them and they were alright.

&gt; Law implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include closed-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness, and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.

Judoon are Lawful-Neutral, or just Lawful-Stupid. Agent Johnson (from Torchwood) is another good example. Torchwood London and UNIT may also be.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Obese people do cost the NHS more to treat that healthy people

I've just seen this first hand, having spent a few unplanned days in hospital.  I had an infection ([cellulitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis)) that suddenly flared up from an old skateboarding wound and required hospitalisation for some hardcore IV antibiotics.  They put me on the diabetic ward because it's a problem that's common in diabetics, apparently.  

One bloke on the ward was 180kg (~28 stone in old money) and didn't get out of bed once in the 3 or so days I was there.  He was in his mid to late forties, I guess, and hadn't worked in 4 years.  He was a lorry driver but had to give it up when he couldn't climb into the cab any more.  He had spent a combined total of nearly 2 years in hospital over that time.  As far as he was concerned, it was better than being at home because he had people running around after him all day.  He had no intention of getting ""better"" and going home where he would have to fend for himself.  ""4 star service"" he called it - ""I can't give them 5 stars because sometimes you push the buzzer and they don't come straight away"", he said.

He alone took up more of the staff's time than the other 5 patients on the ward put together. Not to mention the cost of having him permanently occupying a bed, the cost of treatment, specialist equipment and so on.

I'm glad that we live in the kind of society that helps people like this, because without the NHS he would be dead within a week.  But it was also extremely frustrating to see other genuinely needy people having to go without because he was hogging so much of the limited resources.

Mrs. Brown's Boys is decent but you can pretty much call the episodes from the outset. At times it becomes guess when the fourth wall gag will happen. My parents were telling me that they have seen the stage show each year it is on, which came before the BBC series, and it is much funnier. BBC censor him quite a bit.

Sadly I think Royal Bodyguard will be David Jason's final series. I can't remember a laugh I got from him since The Colour Of Magic and even then he was horribly miscast as Rincewind.

There was always talk of costs becoming prohibitive, but older smokers always recount how they've been saying the same thing for years, decades even. I stopped in the end because I felt my health deteriorating and it scared me. I'd also observed how older smokers all had swarthy looking leathery faces – something I think the anti-smoking campaigns haven't highlighted enough – and I didn't want to end up looking like that, irrespective of whether the habit was killing me or not. 

One thing I have against excessively increasing taxes on harmful substances, is that it only really affects the poor. I was in a well paid job when I smoked, so the cost was almost immaterial to me. I could afford the increases comfortably so they were having almost zero effect. A good education campaign would have been far more likely to influence me.

According to [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharmaceutical_companies), GlaxoSmithKline made a profit of £5.6 billion in 2009 on revenues of £28.3 billion (roughly 20%) and spent £4.1 billion on R&amp;D.  Meanwhile the NHS spends around £11 billion a year on drugs, accounting for 12% of its total budget ([source](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Pharmaceuticalpriceregulationscheme/DH_4071841)).  If, hypothetically, GSK was a non-profit then it could more than double its R&amp;D spend for the same revenue.  Or it could cut drug prices and reduce its income without sacrificing the current R&amp;D level.

If the top 20 developed nations invested half of their current drug spend (assuming the UK figures as average) into non-profit drug research, development and production then that's £100 billion to play with.  It's more than twice the current R&amp;D spend of all the drug companies on the planet.

And/or have the patent dictate mandatory cross-licensing terms so that other companies can make versions of the same drugs and pay an appropriate licensing fee to the originator.  To the best of my knowledge, drug companies do not tend to cross-license drugs because they prefer to keep a monopoly on them for as long as possible.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Seriously? Leave your family, friends, colleagues for being unemployed, because shame on you for being temporarily unable to pay your rent.

The sad reality of the current property market is that many fully employed people are having to leave their family, friends, etc., and move elsewhere because they can no longer afford to live in the areas they grew up in.  

So, while I agree that people should get their rent paid when *temporarily* unemployed, I don't think that the long term unemployed have a right to expect their excessively high rent to be paid indefinitely by the state so that they get to live wherever they want.  Not when it's a luxury that many fully employed people can't afford.

The new benefit cap of £26k pa seems reasonable to me.  If your rent is £30k a year and you don't find work in the first ~10 months (or whenever the £26k would run out, proportionately) then I'm sorry but you'll have to consider moving somewhere cheaper.  I agree it's a massive inconvenience, but it's something that those in full employment have to deal with, too.",0,1328192052,null,0,false,0,c3n5z78,t3_p6xm4,t1_c3n5z78,t3_p6xm4,null,1428283437,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

When it comes to numbers like these, you cannot expect to simply say, ""Well it's the fatties' own fault!"" and wash your hands of it. Combating obesity is something everyone needs to be involved in. Our culture is one of sedentary lifestyles, overeating, overdrinking, and of little exercise. A great many people aren't overweight at all but are complicit in the normalisation of unhealthy lifestyles. 

For instance, I'm a very skinny man, and yet I am not healthy. I'm simply lucky with my metabolism. When I had kids I had to make huge changes to the way I ate simply because I didn't want my bad habits to be passed on to them. And whilst they have a pretty varied diet, many of their friends simply have burgers and chips every night. The sad thing is that for many of these children, the consequences of their poor diets might not be felt for another twenty- to thirty-years, by which time they'll have had kids of their own and the whole thing repeats itself.

To really tackle obesity I think we need to educate and enable people to eat healthily. We need to change the mentality that healthy eating is boring or uninspiring.

Obese people rarely hurt themselves from physical activity, probably cant be bothered going to doctors so quickly when they're sick, and die more readily from heart, liver, kidney failure, etc.

I wonder how much these stats are skewed by a PC culture though. For example, an obese person falls over and shatters their hip. The doctor/surgeon knows it was probably caused by obesity, but the report shows ""fell over during physical activity, shattered hip. £250,000"" and its marked up against ""sports injury""..

New Zealand has recently gone through a health system review, and one of the results was a (successful) push to increase registration costs for motorcyclists. The reasons backing it were ""there are 10x more motorcycle injuries than car injuries, they should pay more"". They didn't take into account that more than 50% of those injuries were caused by motorcross (on unregistered bikes), almost all of the road injuries were the fault of a car driver, or that almost all motorcycle owners also own a car.

Statistics are amazingly easy to skew in a way to support whatever story you want..

RTD made the Doctor *old.* No other writer could have him respond the same way, because before RTD he was always the renegade and exile from the ancient Time Lord authority. He was the young rebel, relatively speaking. Now he's ancient and alone and aware/afraid of his own mortality. RTD gave us the first Doctor who doesn't take Time Lord invulnerability for granted.

And if Nine was shell-shocked, Ten was Time Lord on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He's always had a messiah complex but Ten went full on Time Lord Victorius, then realized he was dangerous and verging on totally unhinged. He and the Master and Rassilon are all driven by the same urge to avoid death, varying only in what they were willing to sacrifice and how far they would go to achieve this.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; My fiancee has a macbook...

I've never had any serious problems with the Apple kit I've got but I'm not disputing the fact that others have.  I've had plenty of hard disks, DVD drives, LCD screens and other bits of kit fail on all sorts of different machines over the years.  In my experience, Apple are generally above average in terms of build quality and reliability.  Your mileage may vary.

&gt; Apple is a complete rip off. 

We'll have to agree to disagree on that.  I've been buying and using IT kit for nearly 30 years now and I think it represents excellent value for money for what I want to do.  I own an iPhone (gifted to me by a client) and I bought the wife an iPad for christmas.  They're great as far as I'm concerned but they're ""just"" gadgets and I'm not much of a gadget freak.  I'm sure there are other phones/tablet out there that are just as good or better in certain areas.  Take it or leave it.

But when it comes to desktop/laptop machines I'm far more certain of where I stand (or sit, as the case may be).  I've been using and programming computers one way or another for about 30 years now.  I used PC/DOS/Windows for about 20 years, Linux and various other Unix operating systems (including Sun and Silicon Graphics machines - you don't know the meaning of ""overpriced"" until you've been there, my friend) for about 20 years, and now Apple for close to 10 years.  With lots of overlaps.

Linux is, of course, the cheapest in terms of hardware and software cost.  Microsoft not far behind.  But Linux and Windows both cost me heavily in terms of consuming my own time to get and/or keep things working smoothly.  And time is money when you're working for a living. Linux had all the power I wanted and Microsoft didn't.  On the other hand, Microsoft was everywhere and every bit of kit had drivers for Windows.  Linux didn't.

&lt;fanboy&gt;
Apple gives me the best of both worlds.  OSX is based on a real Unix operating system that, speaking as a developer, gives me all the power, configurability and flexibility that I need.  Speaking as a designer, it also has a beautiful UI that has been designed by experts with usability in mind.  Speaking as an end user who has long since grown tired of installing device drivers, messing around with configuration files and rebooting machines, I'm glad that everything Just Works^tm  

I spend most of my working day living inside a computer: juggling databases, text editors, web servers and all sorts of other ""techy"" things, while working with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and other various ""arty"" things.  When I'm not working, I'm often playing or composing music using my Mac, or checking in on reddit (I'm actually off work sick today, otherwise I would have given up on this debate ages back).  Everything Just Works^tm

So when Apple offers me a product that does all this and they tell me the price, I tell them to shut up and take my money.  I no longer have to run 2 computers (one Linux for development, one Windows for Adobe apps) and I no longer have to spend hours or even days fixing shit when it doesn't work.  My working life is objectively cheaper, more efficient and considerably more enjoyable thanks to Apple.
&lt;/fanboy&gt;

&gt; You're paying for the name, not for some amazing piece of kit.

Wrong. I know *exactly* what I'm paying for and it's not the name.

There's lots about Apple's business strategies that I dislike (i.e. walled gardens), but as far as I'm concerned they're saints compared to the shit that Microsoft pulled for 20 years before them.  But I have no particular brand loyalty.  If someone else came up with a product as good as Apple's for *what I want to do* then there would be nothing to stop me from switching.

However, I totally agree that many people choose (or avoid) Apple because of the name, but that's up to them.  But just because Apple doesn't do it for you doesn't mean that it's wrong for everyone.

TL;DR: not a fanboy, just a happy user

This extra VAT burden means that libraries have less to spend on electronic publications making it very difficult for them to move towards e-provision.

The academic community is now getting behind an e-petition calling for VAT on electronic resources to be abolished, or at the very least reduced to the 5% rate levied elsewhere in Europe. 

100,000 signatures are needed for the topic to be debated in the House of Commons. Anyone can sign:

• You will need to provide your name, address and email 
• You can choose to receive email updates from the government about the e-petition

Perhaps rather than cut benefits for people with children already, the rules for future generations should be changed to lower the cap and make sure they know it.

Horse riding has the most injuries per person in the UK as you're going to fall and then you've got a giant horse either landing on you or kicking at you. The study I read said horse riding #1, trampolining #2 and I forget what was third, it was few years ago. 

Smokers contribute about £8bn per year in taxes with an average spend by the NHS tackling smokers problems of about £2.6bn, again you can find these numbers pretty easily. Smokers have lower life expectancies and where care becomes super expensive is end of life and dementia, most smokers will die of something else before they get to that stage and thus cost the state less. There is a famous study produced by a big tobacco giant detailing it all before they realised it probably wasn't great marketing. 

So yeah, is horse riding dangerous and a lifestyle choice? Yes it is. So back to you, should we therefore tax it? I say no. We all choose to live our ways in various dangerous ways but taxing them all would be impossible. I don't drive and people who do are more likely to injure themselves doing so, should we tax that?

During the Time War, the Doctor was given either 510 or 511 extra regenerations, depending on whether the regeneration used to create the Meta-Crisis Doctor counts as a full one.

true,bunnygurl,tennant,Tennant,"Philosophy is the process by which arguments are assessed.  People create bad arguments all the time, but they aren't philosophizing and they aren't philosophers.  They are just regular people that are failing to reason properly!  That said, if one is to philosophize.... it is to respond logically in response to a poorly reasoned argument by showing it's logical errors... and that, dear boy, is philosophizing!

Using a simple argument as an easy example of the types of thought involved: 

Some s are p;

Therefore some s are not p.

Some s are not p;

Therefore some s are p.

Given that the top statement is true, are either of the conclusions correct?  The answer should be no.  In the first group, you have no way knowing what the rest of the s are.  They might be p.  In the second set, you have no way of knowing if some s are p given the information provided. 

Let's apply this to something more concrete:

Some politicians are corrupt;

therefore some politicians are not corrupt.

You have no way of knowing whether any the rest of the politicians are not corrupt with the given information.  This is simple logic.  But it applies to the even most complex arguments.  Once you understand how to argue with using fallacies or poor argument style, you become a more more convincing and more formidable opponent in a debate.  In the academic world, it means writing critiques, usually, of other's works. 

Let's get more complex, shall we?

And excerpt form a text: ""…I want to list seventeen summary statements which, if true, provide abundant reason why the reader should reject evolution and accept special creation as his basic world-view. …

Belief in evolution is a necessary component of atheism, pantheism, and all other systems that reject the sovereign authority of an omnipotent personal God.""

What is wrong with this?  Let me simplify it to argument format:

If atheism/pantheism is true then evolution is true. 

Atheism/pantheism is false. 

Therefore, evolution is false.

Even if the first premise were true—which it is not—it doesn't follow from a rejection of atheism or pantheism that one must reject evolution. 

Welcome to logic 101.  I'll be your professor for the journey.  Please keep hands in the thread at all times and your laptop/monitor in the upright and locked position.

Here is proof that I read your letter, I am restating the contents of your letter in a way that shows I read and understood it. You may find some other details that I know about this issue interesting. You may also like to see that I am generally a well-informed person.

Please know that I have sympathy towards you and the issue that you brought up. Let me quickly say how I appreciate it when people bring their concerns to me, even when I disagree with them or don't care. I honestly do sympathise, and I honestly do think you are completely wrong.

Let me describe to you what I am going to do about your issue. I'm going to exaggerate because you probably think I have a lot more power to change things than I really do, and if I say that I'm only going to do something ineffectual you will think that I am not sympathetic to your issue or that I am actively conspiring to make your life worse.

If I am able to do something about your issue, expect a call. I love it when I actually change something and will get the most out of it that I can.

If require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I know that you won't hesitate, as half my constituents seem to think I'm their psychiatrist.

It's not the job of the judge to determine the defendant's guilt, just whether what he's been accused of is a crime here too, which in the judge's view it apparently is, particularly given O'Dwyer embedded videos in his site (the judge took the view that this materially constitutes hosting them himself, since his users probably had no idea of the technicalities of a different HTML tag). It's the possibility that the accusation may be valid that is key. On that basis, an extradition order has been granted. 

Happy to be corrected on any of this, of course, but that's my understanding of the situation. 

The most sensible course would appear to be for the CPS to bring a prosecution I the UK, but for whatever reason, they seem reluctant to do that.

true,DearBurt,null,null,"Well, I was in town for Hogmanay.  My buddies and I were on a two-week vacation/drinkathon, having already been to Dublin and afterward going to London, Brussels and Amsterdam. Edinburgh was by far our most favorite stop of the trip, and we'll be back for damn sure!  The night before, my buddies and I did the torchlight processional, which was so unbelievably surreal and fun. (Afterward, we went to that Frankenstein bar and drank rum and cokes out of suitcases and video-taped the bouncers rough up a belligerent drunk outside -- good times!)

So, on New Year's night, after going to the castle and partaking in a few touristy things, we went down to the festival. We weren't staying far (rented an apartment on Jamaica). Long story short: After midnight we're time traveling from libations.  In fact, at some point I came to in a dark alley, on the curb with someone nudging me with their foot, making sure I was alive.  Needless to say, I was a bit concerned and started wandering around and texting my friends. After a couple of blocks, I came around a corner and actually ran into one of my friends, who was leading a group of about 20 people, all of whom were drinking and having a great time and delighted to have found the drunk friend he was looking for.  Eventually, we met up with the others and went over to Bailie Bar, where, a day before, was the first place we sat down and had a beer upon arriving in town.  

Now, by my own admission, I was already blacked out, so the rest of this (and some of what I've already said) could be a bit wrong. But, this is how I remember it, so here we go!  While standing/swaying around and enjoying some cask ales, I looked across the way -- could've been right next to the guy for all I know -- and noticed a tattoo on his arm. I'd seen this tattoo before, but where?  *I know that tattoo*, I kept thinking. (By now his boys and he probably noticed the creepy drunk with trash on his clothes, swaying back and forth, peering into his soul from across the bar.) Finally it hit me.  It was one of Axl Rose's tattoos!  The [Victory or Death](http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/axl_rose_signed_pix.jpg) tattoo, like the 32nd Armor Regiment's coat of arms. (It's also the motto of several Scottish clans -- FYI, I'm learning this as I type/Google.)  

Now ... to understand my excitement at this, you have to understand that I was roughly seven years old when *Appetite for Destruction* dropped. I mean, in August '81, two things (of worth) were born into this world: me and MTV. Nothing against my parents, but I was essentially raised in front of MTV.  Guns 'N' Roses were my first real heroes (besides Mark McGwire).  Within minutes of walking up to this guy, I've explained this, and, to my utter delight, he says the same thing. Before you know it, we're all toasting to King Shithead and (in our opinion) the greatest rock 'n' roll band of all time, reciting lyrics and generally getting rowdy. Eventually, one of them asks if I had a tattoo. ""Hellz yeah I gots a tattoo, too!"" I exclaimed, sloshing my drink everywhere. On the outside of my right thigh, I have the [Gadsden flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_flag), so I put my drink down and started to unbuckle my jeans. Only, I forgot that I was wearing long underwear. Usually, I'd just drop my pants and pull up my boxers. But, there would be none of that, so I just decided to drop everything to my ankles, hold my junk in my hand and show my new besties my trouser snake. 

At this point, my stateside buddies look over to see me, in the middle of a random bar halfway across the world, with my pants around my ankles, my dick in my hand and four or five Scots circled around me, drunkenly moaning, ""Ah, fuck yeah.""  They probably thought I was on the chopping block for some sort of black-market manwhore society ... and freaked out. Of course, as soon as they came over and realized what was going on, it was all boisterous laughter and more rounds!

So, to reiterate, it probably didn't happen that way -- in fact, I'm hoping one of them reads this and says, ""Uh, no man. Here's how it went down ..."" -- but I absolutely had a crazy time in Edinburgh. ",0,1328226832,null,0,false,0,c3ncbkc,t3_p85h6,t1_c3ncbkc,t1_c3nazfa,null,1428286496,5,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,5

I'm not exactly an avid follower of Astrology myself, but due to my father, I've had to be more aware of the in-depths of it all. I will be the first to agree that astrologers have little to no interest in proving astrology in terms of empirical science. However, there is so much anecdotal evidence, stacks upon stacks of historical data relating to events and the positions of celestial bodies at the time. Throughout thousands of years, they developed recognisable patterns and cycles of human behaviours. Whether they directly influence human behaviour is open to debate, but at the least, the heavens do seem to reflect these cycles in a recognisable fashion.

Regarding the Zodiac constellations, they are not literally utilised in Astrology. Rather they are used as labels for regions of the sky in relation to earth, akin to timezones or segments of an orange. It doesn't actually relate to the stellar constellations. I'm surprised that this isn't more frequently mentioned on online resources. 

Astrologers also use the place of a person's birth to make their charts. Astrologers take the place of birth and date of birth to calculate where the various planets were at the time of their birth. Based on the positions in each planet in each zodiac region, house and in relation to each other (opposing planets will naturally have an effect on each other), they develop details into each facet of a person's personality. If you ever happen to see a chart created from scratch, it's a remarkably complex process. It's either a lot of elaborate bullshit, or they legitimately believe in this stuff.

Having been raised around astrologers most of my life, seeing the much of the history behind all of this, it seems like such a shame for Astrology to be so frankly and bluntly written off as bunk. My father can get into my head far too well, although maybe that's just parents, I don't know, I can't compare after all. 

I could bitch for a little bit about sun sign astrology (the horoscopes you see in newspapers), but I'm afraid I'm losing focus for the time being. If you want me to go into it, let me know. Otherwise thanks for reading. Even if it's in a historical context, I hope there is more openness to study astrology in the future.",0,1328231566,null,0,false,0,c3nd4oq,t3_p1l6i,t1_c3nd4oq,t1_c3m23gk,null,1428286875,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Assuming for the moment that it is, this actually explains City's ability to play hardball over Tevez recently - his contract was also signed before summer 2010, so won't count towards any FFP calculations either (that's not the only reason - I'm pretty sure they're more willing to hold firm over Tevez because they feel they have the moral high ground in that situation and want to teach him a bit of a lesson, not to mention they're likely feeling a little burnt on the Adebayor deal too, given his success for us - if not they would have probably accepted Liverpool's loan offer).

I'm not sure there was anything more to us getting Adebayor than hubris on City's part; they thought they'd moved so far past us that it was reasonable for them to no longer consider us direct competition. They certainly weren't the only ones underestimating us last summer, and it's back-fired somewhat (though no one's likely to remember that if they carry on as they are and win the league...). This wasn't the case when we were after Bellamy - we were very much considered direct rivals at that point, having just kept them out of the CL.

There are other reasons for them to let Adebayor go somewhere on loan - sitting him in the reserves for a year is certainly no way to maintain the value of a big asset (as they're finding with Tevez now).

I don't want to sound like a grinch but I wont be losing any sleep if we lose the final to Cardiff, because winning the League cup is nothing to write home about. Getting back into the top 4 is way more important than this competition has ever been.

The FA Cup is more prestigious and you are likely see a more high profile final.

I dont think I ever recalled a game in the League Cup under Rafa where he fielded his strongest team without CL or the Prem in mind. Once we qualified for the CL and were battling for the title, the league cup was on the back burner.

Before that Houllier had a good run with the Comp winning it in the treble year which helped us come out of a 10 year slump. He also won it in a very disappointing season for us, which also turned out to be his last.

Before that Roy Evans won it in a period of our history when we were in decline.

Before that we won it 4 times in a row in the 80's when we were dominant in every competition.

You cannot tell me as a fellow supporter for the last 30+ years that you have ever had an argument with a Manc or an Arsenal fan and glorified the competition and they have taken you seriously?

The title says goosebumps inc. I'm sorry but I cannot get goosebumps over something knowing we are underachieving as a club and trying to mask it with an appearance in the League Cup final.

It's great that we are in another final, FA Cup final would be great too, if we get into the CL I will personally buy the End Of Season review for us both.
