2- Yes, yes it is. It's not as bad as Detroit, but it's still bad. It's one of those places that was designed in the 60s where the only concern was maximizing unit density, so there are a lot of alleyways and dead ends which are typically unlit and encourage crime.

To show good intent, for you seem to have missed the light side of the GP, I notice in your comment history (apologies, again, for looking at it; but you did attempt to read mine) that you've asked several questions on this site which have gone unanswered and in case this is still so, I'll answer them here and now:

* Depending on what sort of job you want to do, a BSc in mathematics or physics can sometimes be fine; they open a lot of doors into other industries but in software alone they can be very handicapping as opposed to straightforward computer science (all consideration of degree drops away after ~5 years, mind). As to actual institutions, they're normally just divided into {Cam+Ox+ICL, Russell Group, Ex-polytechnic} - interviewers know a lot about specific universities from past applicants but that's not something people tend to get judged on. The only thing you really *need* a graduate degree for is research, but they're good fun regardless and worth considering closer to the time.

* A-levels do not make a big difference when applying for jobs, but they have a huge impact in what undergraduate course you can get into. Best to do as much maths as possible then fill up the rest with the sciences.

* Never work any harder on jumping through assessment hoops than you have to in order to ensure that you'll get the grade you want. Taking a BSc is a good idea because, as has been implied, the Dunning-Kruger effect is a terrible thing and you'll never know what you missed learning about if you don't.

* Yes, most industries expect every new face to be attached to an accreditation of some sort.

To this end I think it would be better if the government had a more active role in the economy and employment - now constructing council houses to alleviate the rent problems, but in other productive work as well. Otherwise we have this stupid situation where no-one is employed, and so can't afford to pay businesses/raise capital to create any business opportunity that would provide employment.

It's particularly bad that the government seems eager to abandon any role it has in education as well, as that is really one of the most important parts to maintaining a productive workforce.

If we had government industry and education run to the benefit of Britain (rather than saving some pennies by shipping all the work to India and China), we might be able to educate people for work and strengthen the productivity of the whole nation.

Exactly, so let them be. I'm a part of this group, I do accumulators for 1p-£1 depending on odds, and will never spend any more than £1 on one because I know it's daft and I'm a student, but for that nominal fee I get a hell of a lot of excitement on a Saturday afternoon.

Where as I can take or leave the machines, I do enjoy roulette at the casino, because even though I know the odds are against me, they're not programmed towards certain profits and it is about as random as anyone could hope for.

The government have no business trying to be everyone's mum and dad. If I were on a six figure salary and I chose to nip into a bookies on my lunch break from time to time and put £20 or £100 on a spin, who are they to tell me that I'm not allowed because people with less disposable income than me can't afford to do so but, for some reason, decide to do so anyway?

These people that are bad with money / have addictive personalities will become addicted to something, whether it's gambling or not. If the government really want to lower addiction, gambling is the least of their worries; alcohol and smoking are a lot worse in terms of general health of the country and the NHS bills that follow. Where as I don't like the government getting involved too much, higher taxes on alcohol and cigarettes are understandable as the damage caused costs the taxpayer lots of money.

*And so it goes on. Shakhtar Donetsk beat Metalurh Zaporizhzhya 2-0 on Saturday – Douglas Costa converted a penalty before a late goal from Luiz Adriano sealed it – to take their winning streak in the Ukrainian league to 23 games, 14 of them this season. They lead the table by 12 points and, already, with the season one game from its halfway point, it seems inconceivable that they will not lift a seventh title in nine years. The focus, understandably, is all on the Champions League and Wednesday's game against Chelsea.

At the moment, Shakhtar are in a happy position. They can rest players domestically, essentially using those games as practice matches, clocking up the wins, building confidence, perhaps experimenting with tactical tweaks. Although the party line is to spout the usual platitudes about no easy games, the Armenian Henrikh Mkhitaryan let the truth slip when asked if he'd had to work ""really hard"" in the home game against Chelsea a fortnight ago. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""This is not the Ukrainian championship. When playing in the Champions League, you must move faster, close down the zones, orchestrate fast attacks. There are no weak opponents. All the teams are very strong. We must know how to defend, how to attack.""

The long-term prognosis, though, may be less positive. It's not easy for teams used to winning comfortably at home to then raise their level for the tougher battles of the Champions League. If an average game is won 3-0 or 4-0, they lose defensive focus, forget how to fight. Given their form – in all competitions the only game Shakhtar have not won this season was the 1-1 draw at Juventus – it seems absurd to criticise, but they have conceded soft goals against both Juve and Chelsea.

In fact – and again, this feels like ludicrous nitpicking – their Champions League record this season should be even better than it is. Shakhtar have controlled all three matches, have created tons of chances, and yet their goal difference is only 5-2. They have been wasteful in front of goal in all three games – albeit against Chelsea in part because of a superb performance from Petr Cech. Now perhaps that is coincidence – all teams have games in which they miss chances – but it may also be that Shakhtar lack a certain edge in front of goal.

Some would blame Luiz Adriano, and it is true that his strength as a centre-forward is bringing others into play and creating space rather than finishing, but he is not the only one who's been profligate; it may be that when a team are used to creating a couple of dozen chances a game, a certain sloppiness can creep in. Shakhtar could really do with Dynamo Kyiv getting their act together soon.

That, though, is the one small negative in what has otherwise been an utterly exceptional season for Shakhtar. The difference to last season, when they finished bottom of their Champions League group after a series of limp displays, could hardly be greater. ""Last year, if you remember, there were problems in the first game when the referee sent off two of our players,"" Mircea Lucescu, the manager, explained. ""Fernandinho wasn't fit. There were also other problems regarding the fitness of our players.

""Last year's exit from the group stage made us regroup, analysing once again everything we had been doing. By winning the championship, cup and Super Cup, we tried to make up for our exit from the Champions League. We won all these titles, and it gave us confidence. The level of this year's competition for first-team places has resulted in our players' improvement.""

Fernandinho's return from injury has been a major positive, partly because it allows Mkhitaryan to play further forward – in the position Jadson used to occupy – but also because he is the ideal player to link back and front of the team. Tomas Hubchsman sits deep to protect the back four and Fernandinho distributes while being willing to carry the ball forward and make the sort of runs that led to the second goal a fortnight ago.

It was in the wide areas, though, that Shakhtar really hurt Chelsea. Roberto Di Matteo has spoken repeatedly this season of the need for ""balance"", of giving his creators freedom without losing defensive stability. In Donetsk, he left out Eden Hazard, playing Juan Mata on the left with Ramires on the right and Oscar central, but again his full-backs were left exposed.

Ramires effectively cancelled out Razvan Rat in the first half – as he had Kwadwo Asamoah in the Juventus game – but on the left Mata may as well not have been there for all the attention Darijo Srna paid him. Mata is reasonably diligent about his defensive duties – see the way he robbed Kyle Walker before laying on Chelsea's fourth at Tottenham – but he simply couldn't cope with Srna's energy as he bounded past him again and again. There seemed to be an attempt by Chelsea to meet fire with fire on that flank, particularly after half-time when Hazard came on, and Ashley Cole was far more attacking than Branislav Ivanovic. All that meant, though, was Alex Teixeira finding space or being able to isolate Cole.

The other key to Shakhtar's domination in the first game was Mkhitaryan, who seemed to find it far easier to escape Mikel John Obi than Oscar did to get away from Hubschman at the other end. That perhaps lay behind the decision to substitute Frank Lampard and move Ramires into a holding role when Hazard was introduced. The Brazilian did, to an extent, check the surges of Fernandinho, but Mkhitaryan, one of those players with an enviable comprehension of where other players are, seemed always to find space.

Chelsea's approach to Wednesday's game will be fascinating. Do they assume that with home advantage they will be able to impose themselves, knowing that if they can keep the ball in the final third Shakhtar are vulnerable? Or do they take measures to negate Shakhtar?

It seems bizarre to discuss breaking up the Hazard-Oscar-Mata front three, or at least bringing in any one else but Ramires, but perhaps Ryan Bertrand could be deployed on the left to try to check Srna (or Ramires could play on that flank, as he did in the first leg against Barcelona). Will Mikel be able to cope with Mkhitaryan? And how will Ivanovic deal with Willian – by sitting deep or by attempting to bypass him by simply playing higher up the pitch?

This is a vital game – for Chelsea particularly – but it is also a fascinating game tactically between two sides who essentially look to play the same way.*

If you wanted this level of freedom so much you would happily have companies advertising heroin on T.V and selling it on every high street, it might give more freedom to the individual but wouldn't be good for society in general.    

Gambling adds absolutely nothing productive to our society and absolutely ruins peoples lives, the idea that you can help solve this by offering probability lessons in school shows how naive and blinkered you are to the reality of this problem. If you want to read about how real peoples lives and families and the mental torture that easy access to gambling puts people through try reading some of these http://www.gamcare.org.uk/forum/index.php?f=23    


Gambling addiction is different to every other addiction is some very specific ways which can be protected against, instead of encouraged. In comparison to other vices the speed at which you can financially ruin you're life is faster than anything else in existence. The availability of it is also unlike anything else, if you are addicted escaping from temptations is near impossible, its on T.V, on every high street and on-line and you can do it without anyone knowing. 

It is also most dangerous to those who are financially desperate and think they may be able to get out of trouble through it. What's most dangerous is if it actually works and they win. The notion that somebody should be able to play high stakes if they wish to for fun is fine, but their should be regulations such as credit checks to ensure membership for those players  to make sure that someone who has a problem does not have access to something that will ruin his life for the next ten years for someone else's profit.

He's charming yet goofy, one of those ""ugh, I just can't stay mad at you"" type of characters.  His eye sparkles for adventure and loves to just waltz about finding things that are messed up.

Compared to 10, I still like 10 more.  10 was observant, yet excitable.  If something stood out, he didn't immediately try to fix it or solve it, he wanted to see what would happen.  He had a curiosity to  him that made you  just want to follow him wherever he may take you.  You say the passion in everything he did, you felt every emotion from joy to pain and loss.

As far as the writing and direction of the show, THAT'S where I've felt it's gone completely downhill.  I've had a hard time putting my finger exactly on it, but it's a wide variety of things that just turn me off.  With the new direction, it seems like we are always just 2 steps away from knowing what the hell is going on.  In a way, they tell us more than we want to know, but not enough of what we NEED to know.  A lot of the series and arcs, when taken as a whole, are very good, but the individual episodes seem lackluster and incomplete.  I always feel like I've just been thrust into the middle of something, whereas before I felt like we always caught the opening and closing segments of a story.  Even when there were over-arching plots that ran through the whole season, you never felt like you were missing something.  There were hints and curiosities sprinkled throughout, but you weren't constantly going ""ok what? WHAT?""

With the new direction, I feel like so much emphasis is being placed on the ""HAHA WHAT A TWIST RIGHT?"" that it's become commonplace, like the ability to fool the audience is more important than the ability to tell the story.

I like 11, I enjoy his character and his quirks, and I like Smith's portrayal...but I just can't seem to get past the writing.

Absolutely nothing? Jobs? Tax Revenue? Entertainment? And ruins peoples lives? Yes it might ruin some peoples lives but not for the vast majority.

The question is whether it's acceptable to limit the rights of the majority just to protect the few?

I understand that people get addicted to gambling, I have sympathy with their families and friends but you need to realise when you're heading that way and stop early. If, as an adult, you are susceptible to advertising, then that's your fault. We protect children from advertising as they can't make informed decisions, you can't parent a country of adults.

People who are financially desperate are always going to be susceptible to schemes to make money, whether it be crime, gambling or just being ripped off otherwise, regulating the number of machines / betting limits won't be anything like a cure for it. 

I don't want to be told what I am and am not allowed to gamble, simply because some people can't look after their money like an adult.

Oxford, naturally, wasn't much of an indicator about anything as Leeds decided to bide their time for the first 20 minutes then dominated the game. I don't remember him putting a foot wrong, though. He had a poor game against Blackburn, especially in the first half, but so did the rest of the defence - especially Peltier on the other side, who was pretty much at fault for their first two goals.

He played well against Cardiff: his experience and composure really seemed to help the defence hold up against a relentless barrage. We looked a lot worse without him, when he went off injured - and White put in the worst performance at left-back that I've seen in a while, in the subsequent game against Hull. Drury also did well against Forest, although he wasn't really tested as they tried to use the middle as much as possible.

I think that he must have trouble playing week-in, week-out - either that or rumours of Warnock blaming him for Snoddy joining Norwich are true. Warnock also prefers him in away games, I think, because he shores up the defence while he's not the best going forward.

Sounds to me like you are talking out your arsehole. Firstly the gambling industry is huge. There are many different types of gambling and many different types of customer, what you say may apply to a certain section, but not to gambling as a whole.

Secondly, the idea that companies simply want to exploit the vulnerable minority is absolutely ridiculous. And to say that the minority of problem players provide the most profits. That could not be further from the truth.

Whilst I appreciate where you are coming from, you are throwing in a whole load of inaccurate 'fact' which is undermining what you are trying to say.

Of course nobody can help but notice the number of bookmakers in poorer areas, there can be 4-5 within a few hundred meters, some might say that's preying on the poor, others might say they are simply fulfilling a demand.

But I don't understand your solution too well because poor people don't walk into a bookies and spend £10k in an hour. That is what rich people do.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Sadly, I think that this game is going to be another in which we play badly. Burnley have an excellent attack with the best striker in the Championship, and our weakness is that we don't have the ability to retain the ball and keep teams on the back foot. If we could do that, Burnley would be there for the taking with them having one of the worst defences in the league (although they kept a clean sheet in new manager Sean Dyche's first game, so he might have sorted it out already - great appointment, by the way). Sadly, I don't see us doing that: we'll be up against it for most of the game and only have two or three attacks yielding half-chances against the run of play.

With that said, I think that I'll go with a **2-1 to Burnley** scoreline. If both defences get up to their old tricks, it could yet rise higher - to 3-2, even - but I have a feeling that either Burnley will defend well, or we will be chronic up front.

Here's the team I predict Warnock will go with:

-----------------Kenny

Byram---Peltier---Pearce---Pugh

White---Brown---Austin---Tonge

-----------------Diouf

-----------------Becchio

Substitutes: Ashdown, Drury, Green, Norris, Varney, Hall, Gray.

I can't see him changing the team too much. I expect Lees to be ruled out, due to his eye injury, so he'll be forced to start Peltier at centre half - where he plays at his best, to be honest - and find someone else to play at left back. Now this *should* be Drury, but due to his unfathomable reluctance to play him I get the feeling that this will be transfer-listed Pugh, with Drury looking on in disgust from the bench.

I also feel that he'll start with Becchio, but he could just as easily stick with Varney. My reason for starting Becchio is that he came off the bench against Brighton like a man on a mission, so it looks like dropping him might have had its desired effect, in which case Warnock might be convinced to start with him. However, this would lead to Diouf staying short of the Burnley defensive line more often, which might not be what we want. When I really think about it, starting with Varney might be best, as his movement will pull and stretch what has been a fragile defence.",0,1352217040,null,0,false,0,c6x9p5i,t3_12q2q0,t1_c6x9p5i,t3_12q2q0,null,1430334944,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

I also don't think that people with 6 figure salaries are really the mainstay of betting shop customers, as the type of gambling offered by betting shops (functional, bleak windowless dungeons filled with half dead alcoholics) is hardly appealing when you have more salubrious gambling options available to you.  Especially with sport betting migrating more and more over to the internet for those with the means, betting shops are becoming the last refuge of the wretched.

The libertarian outlook of everyone having to look out for themselves may be a valid viewpoint, but it irks people always frame it in the context of 'I know better, why don't all these silly billies throwing their money away just be more like ME!' - It neglects the fact that people have flaws to their character which make them vulnerable to things like addiction through fault of upbringing or circumstance, rather than personal agency.  Given the demonstrable willingness of companies to profit from people in these situations, I don't think it's taking it too far to place limits on the extent to which these places can exploit peoples weakness.  The idea that people with addictive personalities are likely to get addicted to something anyway, so might as well throw them to the wolves, is frankly callous.

Ultimately, it is the astonishing success of these machines to the gambling industry that is the greatest argument for their increased regulation.  I have walked through many a run down area where the gambling shops full of these machines are the only businesses still going strong.  It is not completely fanciful to argue that if a bit less money was siphoned out of the community through these venues, some of the pubs and shops in the surrounding area might feel the benefit.  You can't use the same arguments against regulation that work in the other sectors of business (suspect as some of those are) because there is just no case to be made to say that gambling actually adds anything to the economy.

This in combination with little to no punishment for women who falsely cry rape has lead to more people using it after they regret sleeping with a man.

So now when a man and women have been drinking, the man can be accused of rape because the woman ""was not of a clear state of mind"" and the woman does not have to have any responsibility hang on her because ""being drunk isn't an invitation to rape"" ""Look at what I'm wearing, tell me I was asking for it""

She lost her job, I was in university surviving on money from my dad, who was paying my half of the rent and bills, and occasional teaching income. She needed to go on benefits, but was told she was not allowed to get JSA unless I signed up too. We told them that I was a post grad student, and thus ineligible to get JSA. They said that I'd have to apply for an exemption. I told them I didn't want or need it, and I certainly didn't want to be obliged to fulfill the terms of the contract that I'd have to sign saying that if I didn't apply for at least x number of jobs per fortnight then both me **and my girlfriend** would be disqualified from claiming benefits for a long time. Their only response was that on the exemption form I should write that I didn't actually want their money! 

It was an incredibly stressful period for both of us. We felt trapped by a system that forces people in unmarried relationships to operate as one financial entity. She was a highly skilled and experienced person in her field, and only needed to go on benefits for a month or two while she found a new position, but the Job Centre insisted that I should get involved (even though a. by their rules I was ineligible and b. I didn't want their money) and we HAD to claim for two people.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, for a start the Tory party isn't out to get the poor. That's a particularly bad ideal that stems from reading too much into CIF. It's a 'Daily Mail' type view of the Conservatives. 

IDS who is in charge of these reforms has no reason to be unsympathetic.  IDS isn't exactly your typical Eton/Oxford career politician. On top of that he's already hit his career peak - and is senior enough to not be moved. He is essentially trying to reduce bureaucracy, wastage and loopholes in the benefits system. It's his legacy so to speak. He has no reason not to be sympathetic to the poor.

Will it in practice? well, that's to be seen. I have my own doubts that's more related to Government inability put into place decent IT systems.

However, in OP's situation there are clearly things that should be done. For example, in his situation I would move out of the flat and share a room with the GF In a shared house. I know several people who did this whilst job hunting after uni. This will massively reduce outgoings for a start.

One thing that does bug me hugely is this mentality on Reddit that the Tory party hate the poor, they hate the working class, all they want to do is enslave everyone who doesn't have a knighthood. It's such BS.

For instance, I have no love for the Labour party - but I don't go around saying all they care about is trying to make the entire population dependent on benefits. Or that they are only sympathetic to single mothers on benefits.

The poor vote too - The Conservatives like poor people as they represent unbridled ambition to NOT be poor. At least that's the idea. Giving people the ability and responsibility to make their own way in life, not depend on the state. However, if things go wrong - there's a safety net there. 

My membership card says the following:

""Our party seeks to advance opportunity, nurture responsibility and protect security "". Nowhere does that say 'we hate the poor'.

Why don't you try actually reading up on what the Government is doing rather than hating on them in some pseudo anti-Thatcherite rant. This isn't the 70's/80's,

No. Because she has been at University, she hasn't made sufficient NI contributions in the 2 financial years counted to claim contributions based JSA. She is therefore only entitled to Income Based JSA which takes your income into account as you are a co-habiting couple. As your income is over the amount for a couples JSA, she won't get anything other than NI contributions. You may be able to claim Housing Benefit and Council Tax benefit if you live in an area where rents are sufficiently high enough that after paying them you're left with less than around £120 a week to live on.

&gt;  My partner and I are not married nor legally joined in any way - there is no arrangement where I give her money on a formal basis. 

For the purposes of the Social Security Act you are by the fact you are in a relationship and co-habiting. If you lived separately, she would be entitled to benefits but as you are living together, you are expected to support her as a couple.

&gt;  So I'm wondering on what grounds I am expected to support both of us - especially as I've not been asked any details about my own income or means by the JSA agency.

By the fact you are a couple and that as you have an income greater than the law says you need to live on it is expected that as a couple you support each other. This has been the case ever since the welfare state was founded and is nothing new. You're not being penalised any different to every single generation that has existed since the introduction of unemployment benefits. 



&gt;  So I'm wondering on what grounds I am expected to support both of us

Yes I've already answered this but this is something that really annoys the fuck out of me when people say this. Its like the entire relationship is based on money and it is completely self centered. Society in the UK has always until Generation Y it seems, accepted that couples support one another.

Exactly. And employers know this. They know that as a graduate you are not going to stick around longer than it takes for a better offer to show up, and that you're looking down your nose at the job they're offering. Some of those under 18s they interviewed won't call the position a ""menial job"" - for them it will be exactly what they want.

This is not a case of deserving or fairness. It's the companies doing what's best for them, and the under 18s are not given an unfair advantage over you. You may think that your degree may give you better training in performing these jobs than degree-less teenagers: it doesn't. I'm saying that as a graduate who believes strongly in higher education. 

What I would do in your situation: sign up for all the recruitment agencies you can. Places like REED were great just after I graduated a couple years ago and fixed me up with temp work while I was looking for permanent work. The place I temped at even offered me a permanent position because they were impressed. The kind of jobs you're likely to get at an agency allow more scope to demonstrate your skills because your degree will at least help with office work. Working on tills, nope.

In terms of attacking, the combination of coleman and baines out wide is devastating.  They're two of the fastest wing backs in the league, and both have quality players in front of them in mirallas and pienaar.

The way I see it, beyond his incredibly creative technical ability in front of goal, Suarez is the prime chance-creator for other players on the team.  There have been countless times where Suarez sets up someone like Shelvey, Sterling, etc only for them to bottle it due to lack of composure, inexperience, etc.  In fact, the only person he can consistently link up with to create goals seems to be Gerrard when he is in an attacking midfield role (which we haven't seen much of lately due to Lucas' injury).

What's typical of the Conservatives is trying to roll things back to a mythical Golden Age - the absurdity of which is actually proven by the fact a Conservative government replaced O Levels in the first place.

The problem is that nobody actually knows if the GCSEs have been made progressively easier. 

It may just be that now more time is spent teaching to the test rather than teaching 'knowledge'. It may be that, in standardising the tests and marking schemes, pupils know what is expected of them more than they did in the past. It may be, as you say, that the tests are much easier. It may be that teaching standards have improved. It may be that children are smarter than in the past. It may be that more people are focussing on exams because they know that there are fewer opportunities if you leave school at 16 now than there were 20 years ago.

But it's far easier to show the first question in a GCSE exam (which is usually pretty basic) and compare it to a complex question from an O Level exam, then produce a load of clap trap about how ""it was much harder in my day and kids these days don't know how lucky they are and aren't standards degenerating?""

And Huntelaar is quite a bit older than our other signings, but if the 6m I've heard thrown around has any merit, that's honestly a pretty damn good deal to get a few seasons out of an incredibly good striker.

I've known a number of heroin users in my time, not too many crack users it's true (albeit, crack itself is a product of prohibition, most users, given their druthers would be using powder cocaine, a number would be chewing coca leaves); anyhow, those heroin users who were employed in reasonable paying jobs and had a good access to quality supply were very rarely involved in criminal behaviour.  Why do you make it a class issue?

Though some of our politicians try to push in the American direction of pretending capitalism is something we should be proud of rather than something we use and would dispose of if it suited us.

Other people are saying start with the Ninth Doctor, and that's definitely a good jumping on point because all the basics are reintroduced for new viewers.

true,bartleby,null,null,"I'm an American, and I'll give you the quick overview.

You have to remember that the United States are just that -- a set of *states* -- and that was part of the founding vision as reflected in the Constitution. It is helpful to think of each state as casting its own complete lot for the President, though there are really people who are pledged to do this (the ""electors"") based on the outcome of the popular vote in their state.

Each state is ""worth"" a different amount of votes because, of course, different states have different populations. So how is the number of votes determined? Well, like you, we have two houses in our national legislature, the Senate and the House. Because of the initial compromise between big and small states (that's an oversimplification, but it'll do), every state has 2 senators regardless of population. And every state has at least one representative, but some states have many, many more (CA, NY, TX, PA, IL, FL, etc.) due to larger populations. Your state gets its total number of electoral votes for the total number of senators plus representatives that you have. The minimum number you can have is three because even the least populous states, like Wyoming, have two senators and one representative.

There are a couple oddities involving DC, Maine, and Nebraska. Basically, they added an amendment to the constitution during the 20th century that gave DC 3 electoral votes even though they don't otherwise have a say in any federal elections. And Maine and Nebraska have this odd setup where not all of the electoral votes have to go to the same candidate -- they can split theirs up, though they don't do it very often. Most of the time, Maine is democratic and Nebraska is republican, but in 2008, a little part of Nebraska went for Obama.

So, to wrap this up, the total number of electoral votes up for grabs is 538. This makes sense because there are 435 representatives in the house, 100 senators, and the 3 electoral votes that were given to DC. To win the electoral college, you need a simple majority, which is 270. It is possible to have a 269-269 tie, which would be a hot mess and involves congressional delegations voting by state.)

There you have it. Not a perfect explanation, but it gives you the gist.

I blame the OP for linking the Daily Mail, even in jest, because things like this happen lol! Here are some interesting points incase ANYONE dares take this article seriously.

1. The headline states: ""Misifiring Spurs"" what the actual fuck? Is this the same spurs that have scored in every game this season, or perhaps some other spurs. Andy Carroll is the one misfiring.

2. A player cannot play for more than two clubs in one season. Carroll has appeared for both Liverpool, and West Ham this season, meaning even if we paid him £800billion a week, and gave liverpool £1Trillion he wouldn't be signing in January. *(Just to report, it appears the Daily Ballsack have updated their article to reflect this, it appears they are actually able to read, it's just writing them cannot do)*

3. Tomorrow the Daily Mail will probably report that Real Madrid are looking at £1Trillion rated striker Andy Carroll.

4. Fuck me, scroll down to the comments. Some guy (might even be a spurs fan) actually manages to spell AVB wrong. Not the full name, the actual acronym. He initially calls him AVB, then at the end says maybe it's time to ""get rid of VDB."" It's three fucking letters, and he gets it wrong.

5. The only actual quote from anyone in the entire article is AVB saying we might play two strikers, and that Adebayor was unfit/injured. If anyone actually believes this article, please contact me and I will take you back to last weekend in my time machine, and allow you to alter the fabric of reality so we beat wigan 9-1 again. I promise I won't rob you, slit your throat and bury you in a shallow grave in the Emirates.

Unfortunately I do know people who have been hurt by the changes to ESA, and fear they will be negatively affected by the change from DLA to PIP. Lets be clear here - most of the savings aren't going to come from reducing wastage, bureaucracy or loopholes but from straight forward cuts in benefits - like the cuts to housing benefits.

I do think Universal Credit is a good idea, although it will inevitably be used as an excuse to cut benefits and therefore be unpopular (by lefties at least). 

I was pleased when earlier in the year Ian Duncan Smith called the idea of having an extra £10 billion of welfare cuts ""unacceptable"" and thought finally we were seeing some of this compassionate conservatism I heard so much about in the run up to the last election. It's a shame George Osborne overruled him and the party supports these extra cuts regardless.

The conservative party is made up of a broad spectrum of MPs - IDS is towards the moderate scale but there are undoubtedly some in the party who don't understand/care about poor people in this country. When you see them suggesting a complete removal of housing benefits for under 25s it's hard to think otherwise.

&gt;I think that not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others - and that is their real crime.

I read that in the Telegraph not CiF in the Guardian, and it's not a quote from some leftie but from Tory MP Nadine Dorries.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Coming at the issue from a different angle - are you aware of how few people come forward over sexual assaults and on top of that the ratio of convictions to acquittals? One of the reasons for anonymity on the part of the accuser is due to the general social stigma *still* associated with rape cases. I say this to highlight *why* I think it's the case. One of the problems with not naming the accused is that potential other victims might not come forward - they can't do that if they don't hear about the case. For example: Look at the recent Savile case. How many people spoke out because others already had? Hundreds. Rapists don't generally rape only once, I believe - there are usually multiple victims. Yes it's shitty that some men are wrongfully accused and suffer the stigma too, but this surely is a case of the ""lesser of two evils"", isn't it?

Meanwhile:

&gt; ""little to no punishment for women who falsely cry rape""

Bullshit. I've heard of a number of convictions in the last year alone. You haven't?

&gt; ""lead to more people using it after they regret sleeping with a man""

Citation, please.

By the by: Your comment started off *somewhat* reasonable, exploring the issue of anonymity in general around such cases - it's a tricky area - but you mucked it up by going all victim blamey.

And I say all this while being of the opinion that the law should be changed to extend the definition of rape to include women: at the moment only men can rape because the definition includes the word ""penis"". I make that note to ensure you understand my mindset - it's most definitely not an ""Us and them"" as yours appears to be.

Again, I may be misinterpreting, but another yellow flag. Next I checked out the fb page, which is where I found the 'date founded', and noted that the page had very few likes, indicating the company's lack of online presence. Again, being a new company isn't a bad thing in itself, but it does make one more wary. Finally, I read the thing on the website of past winners.

true,flagondry,tardis,TARDIS,"Hi, musician here. When you say band, do you mean brass band? If so there is an arrangement you can purchase of:

1 The Doctor Who Theme
2 This is Gallifrey : Our Childhood, Our Home
3 Westminster Bridge
4 The Face of Boe
5 The Doctor Forever

Link: http://www.musicroom.com/se/id_no/0706125/details.html

Second option is to see if your band director or educational establishment (I assume you're a school band?) can hire the music.

Failing that, you will probably have to make arrangements yourself. If you are looking for unpublished sheet music you need to contact the [BBC Information &amp; Archives](http://www.bbc.co.uk/informationandarchives/services_ext.html), who hold copies of most (not all) unpublished sheet music commissioned for BBC programmes. However it is likely that they will not have the particular arrangements you are looking for, they probably only hold piano originals or the orchestral arrangements used for recordings and the Proms.

As far as I can tell, you then need to seek copyright clearance from [BBC Talent and Rights Negotiation Group](http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-law-copyright-intellectual-property/). You will need permission both to arrange the music and perform it in public. 

Lastly be sure to inform the [Performing Rights Society](http://www.prsformusic.com/users/businessesandliveevents/musicforbusinesses/Pages/WhatisPRSforMusic.aspx) of what you intend to arrange, perform etc. You must also pay PRS the appropriate royalty so they can pay the copyright owner (they will tell you how much it is). Some educational establishments are exempt.

Hope that helps, good luck.

The towns in Scotland closest to the border would be transformed into hotels/holiday camps, with the price of rooms becoming cheaper the further north you went.

I'm pretty certain that many fields in greenbelt just north of the border would be turned into camp sites as a way to attract people even though they can't technically build a hotel on the land.

Caravan parks would spring up almost overnight.

Courier firms and dealers would be making deals with hotel chains/holiday camps/camp sites for bulk deals on drugs.

There would possibly be a change in legislation for people who run hotels/holiday camps/camp sites where it is harder to get a licence to run the place, and you would have to appear before a magistrate to do so, like you already have to do so now with alcohol licences. You would have to prove you are a responsible person and are not going to be running a dive that puts people's health and safety at risk.

These places would be required to have a certain amount of security staff on site at all times, depending on the number of guests present.

There would have to be regular checks on the places in question to make sure they are being run safely.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Henderson still has a lot to give. He's only 22 and has a long and bright future left in a red shirt. When Gerrard decides to hang up his boots, I back Henderson to take his place and become a great, influential player for Liverpool.

There's nothing that suggests that - Henderson has a good engine and is technically solid (not spectacular, just solid), but doesn't really seem to have the mental fortitude to excel at anywhere near Gerrard's level. At an equivalent age, Gerrard was unafraid to take players on, try risky attacking passes, and in general just make his presence felt on the pitch. Henderson doesn't do any of that - indeed, in Liverpool's biggest fixtures last season, Henderson often went missing - including both Wembley finals. To boot, he was anonymous at the England U21's World Cup, despite being captain.

I'm not saying Henderson can't develop into a good player, I'm just saying there's absolutely nothing that suggests he'll become the next Gerrard. 

&gt; but then again, why are younger, less experienced players getting a look in over Henderson?

Because they're far more positive going forward - Suso and Shelvey aren't perfect, they both have flaws, but both of them provide greater attacking contribution than Henderson. Compare Suso this season with Henderson last season - both being played out of their favoured position, neither fully ready for being in Liverpool's first team on a weekly basis, and yet Suso's been much more impressive.

true,TheJayDizzle,null,null,"i think many of you guys (and especially you GCahill4J) are being very very reactionary. no torres isn't himself, nor should he be missing/not taking as many chances as he's been provided. fine. but 6 goals in the beginning of november isn't terrible when goals come from all over the team. cech is the only one who doesn't look likely to score, even mikel has had more shots than usual. 

the pressure of being the only striker in a champions league team is great, never mind the current holders. he was benched most of last season in favor of drogba, and he got this position due to default almost of no striker purchases and only sturridge on the bench. with a brand new manager/team/system forming behind him as the lone striker for a team he only appeared for last year, things take time to jell. fuck yes i want him to have more goals than he does, hell i expected him to. but he doesn't. jumping on his back like this is only going to exacerbate the problem just like when he signed. i don't want to have to coddle our main man like this, but the fact his he does have a fragile ego, so you are forced to. 

we are spoiled with riches at chelsea and no ones position is certain. it is not as if we aren't scoring and winning games. i don't think any of the losses this year (manu/shaktar in mind) can be solely or even partially contributed to torres not banging in the goals. we remember him in his prime, and he's not now, and that sucks. but we have him. he drifts wide too much, and he should be pulling the trigger earlier instead of dithering or looking for the easy goal/pass, but honestly there is nothing indicating in his performances (bar one or two) that he can't be a 20+ goal a season striker. hell if de gea didn't make that baller save we might not even be having this same conversation. 

its all too early. its all very new. we're second, advanced in the cup, doing okay for a new system in a difficult group in the CL. i guess what i'm trying to say is take a breath/step back and be thankful for what we have.",0,1352248991,null,0,false,0,c6xj2bw,t3_12o82f,t1_c6xj2bw,t3_12o82f,null,1430339387,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

More boys drop out of school, less go on to do A levels, and less go on to university, and after university, males are less likely to be employed.

I know a guy working for my friend who had been on jobseekers for a while after losing his £55k/yr job as an engineer. He's now too qualified for a ""normal"" job in the field, and nobody is hiring higher-ups any more now. He has a house with a mortgage and he was royally pissed off that a woman next door to him was ""earning"" over £30k/yr from benefits.

He was getting almost nothing while out of work, but this woman next door with her five kids knew exactly how to extract the most out of the system - how to call, what to say, what to do at the compulsory meetings etc. He was clueless and basically got bullied by the job centre people and ended up with almost nothing. And as a single guy, living by himself in a home he bought, he's entitled to almost nothing anyway.

Everybody is taking the brunt of cuts. The conservatives just increased minimum wage (a small amount yes) and the tax free allowance, which will be £10k/yr by the next election. That's fairly helpful to low earners.

And as Ivashkin said, they want to reduce the amount of spending overall and want to reduce the amount of people who completely depend on government. That's beneficial to everybody.

New-who has done the whole human introduction angle so many times, it'd be nice to have a companion that gets right to it and is equal to him, can be sassy with him without being overimposing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; are you aware of how few people come forward over sexual assaults and on top of that the ratio of convictions to acquittals? One of the reasons for anonymity on the part of the accuser is due to the general social stigma still associated with rape cases.

Switching things around a little, many things in life are counter intuitive so I'm wondering if secreting the name of the accuser adds to the social stigma. What stays in the closet will remain a skeleton perhaps—a victim will be immediately put into a culture (and framework) of anonymity, so does this persist after the event? I also look to other crimes and I feel there are ones equally sadistic and damaging where both parties are named, so to my knowledge there seems an inconsistency at least, and through that lens why should rape be a special case?

Thinking further to a hypothetical, I presume people are ushered towards anonymity but how often does that prevent others from seeking justice because there lacks visible (anti) role models so to speak? They perhaps know or knew the victim, or know or new the accused, which are relevant to the Savile and ""Mcalpine"" scandal. It took brave people going public to open the floodgates it seems.

Going back to ""social stigma"", that implies persecution, don't act camp for fear of a gay bashing, regret putting your name down on the leaked BNP members list, that sort of thing. So are you suggesting known rape victims come to some secondary harm I am completely unaware of? All I can think of is some ""acting weird"".

I see it written down but I find the stat: [85'000 woman every year claim to have been raped or suffered attempted rape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_offences_in_the_United_Kingdom)"" incredible. It takes the ages 16 to 59 giving a range of 43, so at any one time there is a ceiling of 3.655 million female victims walking around (presuming all survived and lighting didn't strike twice). Perhaps the ""stigma"" is that society just doesn't what to look directly at its culture of violence, the same way it doesn't want to deal with the 180 thousand injuries caused on the UKs road per year. (Doing a similar math: 180k * 43 is a number larger than the UK population; everyone gets injured approximately twice it seems.)

Edit: I understand the stigma, being a rape victim perhaps isn't stigmatised, but making an accusation sometimes is.",0,1352259388,null,0,1352260908,0,c6xls3q,t3_12q8q9,t1_c6xls3q,t1_c6xfqux,null,1430340765,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

From http://www.debretts.com/etiquette.aspx

As you can see it would be quite a job to learn all about British etiquette.  Etiqette is a [shibboleth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth) of some of the higher social classes here (and probably all over the world), and so it produces a negative reaction in some people (as evidenced in some comments here).  However, a lot of the rules of etiquette are based on consideration of other people, and shouldn't be so lightly ignored in my opinion.  Having said that, to use etiqette to make someone feel uncomfortable is arse backwards.

It is more important that you don't get obnoxiously drunk than that you buy halves.

true,aBeardOfBees,essex,Colchester,"Brit here with your guide to ""proper"" meal etiquette. Please note the below is the gold standard for polite company - sitting on the sofa with a pizza watching television probably doesn't require observation of the below.

At the start of the meal, unfold your napkin and place it on your lap. 

Fork in left hand, knife in right. If there are multiples of each on the table, begin with the outermost sets for the early courses and work inwards. When done, place them together on the plate with the pointy ends at ten o'clock.

If there's a spoon on the right of the place setting, use that in place of the knife (for soups etc). For some foods, you may need to use the fork as a scooping device - in these cases, put down your knife, transfer the fork to the right hand, and do it this way. If left-handed, keep it in your left, but always put down the knife. For something like spaghetti, you can use the fork and spoon (to help twist up the pasta on the fork for example).

Lift the food to your mouth, don't lower your head to the food. Keep your mouth closed whilst chewing. Eat slowly. Keep your head raised and enjoy conversation, don't just focus on shoveling everything down as rapidly as possible. Social dinners should be enjoyed leisurely. Feel free to put your cutlery down for a few moments and take your time.

Drink whatever the hell you like. If at a formal event with old-school people and you *really* care what they think, then it's a dry white wine for the lady. But honestly, what you want to drink is a different sort of question to how you should behave at the table.

Table manners are an enforced set of social rules intended to display restraint and a bit of civilization when engaging in the basic biological requirement of eating. A calm and considerate approach to this behavior separates us from animals.

Keeping your bloody mouth closed whilst chewing is in the same category as not whipping down your pants and furiously masturbating in public whenever you feel a sexual urge occur to you. It's common decency for your companions and shows that you aren't dominated by base instincts.

Telling a lady she has to drink halves is just madness.

You find these people everywhere, not just among politicians - I've had employers like that and they were no fun. A lot of people chase money like crazy.

&gt; He's anti-abortion, invokes God all the time like atheists aren't American

&gt; would probably start a war with Iran, despite probably not knowing which countries it borders.

Again, USA has a warmongering track record, this is nothing new, if anything he fits in with the rest of the presidents just fine. Not saying conflict is good, but looking at it historically Romney really isn't anything out of the ordinary when it comes to US presidents. Didn't hear about the poor geography before though, so don't want to comment on that.

&gt; Not to mention the fact that he despises everyone on any form of welfare despite using it in the past.

Romney isn't the only politician to do this, and I'm sure a lot of regular people who feel financially secure share his ideas.

All in all, I'm just saying that Romney is a normal guy, there's a lot of people out there like him. Many people these days lie, are greedy and look down on those with a lesser social status than themselves, the warmongering and god-invoking in politics is more american traits though, but still relatively common in Mitt's country so he's a normal American alright.

How does that work?

Any way, Atos suck, and I'm not sure how this is meant to save money when 40% of appeals are upheld, at the cost of the tax payer.

I've met many disabled people, and they're all willing to work, they want it even. Many would do any job if they could. These aren't people who think they can do better, these are people who can't get work because nobody wants to hire them.

Instead of paying a private company to further stigmatise disability, the government should be doing all it can to get employers to consider hiring a disabled person.

Removing the benefit won't magically give these people jobs. At its worst, it will force them to become more dependent on friends and family, which means others may have to give up their work to become carers. So congratulations, government: you're taking money away from the disabled and forcing workers to be come unpaid carers. Now you have two parties claiming benefits.

&gt; A central question with all such encounter customs is, who takes part: is it everyone in the community, or specifically defined groups? This is probably the most obvious and the most significant difference between medieval and modern practice.  Nowadays guising seems exclusively the province of children.  The Edinburgh range seems to be from about three to thirteen.  The very youngest are initiated into the custom by adults: parents will help to dress, and will shepherd around, the under-fives.  Nurseries, and the first and second year classes of primary schools, used until recently to make Hallowe’en costumes and teach Hallowe’en songs that were then frequently performed as ‘turns’, an institutional community approval which has now been largely withdrawn.  But after about the age of five the adults seem to retire and guising becomes an activity managed entirely by the children: they devise and usually make their own disguises, choose and perform their own pieces, guise (usually in groups or pairs) without adult accompaniment.  In Edinburgh a customary break seems to happen around the first year of secondary school. Group social custom appears to dictate that guising is no longer appropriate much after this point.

&gt; Up until at least the seventeenth century, however, guising seems to have been an activity of adults.  Illustrations show adults; edicts concerning the control of the custom are directed at adults.  It seems, though, that like most Carnival practices, guising was especially associated with the young adult.  The Aberdeen complaint of 1605 centres on  the ‘young men and young wemen of this citie’;24 a 1701 record from Falkirk which identifies those accused of guising refers to each as ‘servant of’ or ‘son of’;25 and accounts up until the early nineteenth century tend to refer to ‘the youth’ or ‘the young men’.  The shift from adult to child guisers seems to have happened a century or even more ago.  An account from Crieff dated 1881 claims that within the writer’s lifetime ‘guisors have deteriorated from full-grown men and women to children’.26 In fact Walter Scott’s description back at the beginning of the nineteenth century records guising in his area as a children’s practice.",0,1352294325,null,0,false,0,c6xr5dl,t3_12q6ad,t1_c6xr5dl,t1_c6xqhqk,null,1430343329,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The public culture that fêted Savile still exists. It’s unfair to him but one way to identify this is thanks to Boris Johnson, and this should in no way be read as tarring Boris with Savile's depravity, crimes or suggesting any moral equivalence between the two men. Nauseated by the veneration of Boris at last month’s Conservative Party Conference, Max Hastings denounced him in the Daily Mail, Hastings had employed Boris and claims a long-time, close-up knowledge. It is hard to believe there has been a more ferocious attack on politician in occupation of high office that spotlights his promiscuity so prominently and persistently: the article is littered with “sexual affairs”, “blackmail” “testimonials from ex-lovers”, “bonkability”.

""Most politicians are ambitious and ruthless, but Boris is a gold medal egomaniac. I would not trust him with my wife nor — from painful experience — with my wallet. It is unnecessary to take any moral view about his almost crazed infidelities, but it is hard to believe that any man so conspicuously incapable of controlling his own libido is fit to be trusted with controlling the country… He is also a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier, figure than the public appreciates.

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK, if you're striving for what I think you're striving for (nice middle-class mother standards), I think I can help (been there, done that.)

1. You have to imagine yourself as a lay-dee. Think Jane Austen/Downton Abbey. Feel your inner Duchess. Carry yourself with grace, even if you think you're as graceful as a baby elephant. Be demure but confident. Also, no matter how thirsty you are, DON'T DRINK PINTS. Stick to nice lady drinks like white wine spritzers and gin and tonic.

2. [Eating politely.](http://www.ehow.co.uk/how_4650530_eat-politely.html) Elbows off the table, use knife AND fork (the fork turned so the curve is on the top) or fork and spoon for dessert. Use the knife to push the food into a neat pile onto your fork. Use mashed potato to glue tricky things like peas onto the fork. Also, if you're dining out and not confident, don't order anything fiddly or difficult to eat. And don't start eating until everyone else has got their meal in front of them.

3. No swearing, no innuendo, and remember your [conversational limits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS37SNYjg8w). Avoid conversations about politics, money and religion.

4. Take your mother-in-law (ish) a small token from your country. I would not fail to be wooed with a bottle of maple syrup and a ~~Nickelback~~ ~~Celine Dion~~ Michael Buble album.

5. Don't drape yourself over your boyfriend or be too free with the PDAs. Remember, he is still her baby boy and always will be. Secretly she is wanting to rip your throat out for being the temptress that lured her baby away, even if her baby is now 35 with a beard and a beer belly.

6. Don't slouch on their sofa. Perch on the edge whilst you sip your tea demurely.

I've probably forgotten something, but this is a start. Good luck!

Don't _not_ vote. Spoil the vote. The easy way is to vote for everyone.

Some people will now say ""that's the same as not voting"", they are wrong and are only looking at the direct consiquence to the action. Your vote will indeed count for nothing when the votes are counted up. What spoiling _does_ do is create a countable vote of no confidence in anyone, and following that the whole system.

However, imagine the ripples running through the democratic system if more than 50% of people (those that don't bother voting now) all stood up and gave, in the polling booth, a vote of no confidence in the whole system.

Hell, even 10% of votes being spoiled would send shockwaves through the whole system.

I would suggest bringing the tests under the control of the NHS and that they be performed by real doctors.  That way the £3bn in contracts the DWP pays ATOS could instead be given to the NHS and the doctors would have access to the claimant's files and history.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Government was originally formed simply to protect rich people from poor people, and a great deal of its current function is still about that.

I don't accept that as either its origin or its current purpose.  Originally, government was all about transferring wealth from the poor to the rich, and a great deal of its current function is still about that.  To quote a man who greatly inspired me in my youth: ""To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed, legislated at, regulated, docketed, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, assessed, weighed, censored, ordered about, by men who have neither the right, nor the knowledge, nor the virtue.""

&gt;For example I doubt it's any coincidence that the police are more concerned with the kind of petty crime that the underclasses perform than they are with the kind of serious fraud which is perpetrated by the financial elite - the Serious Fraud Office has been seriously flawed and underfunded from it's inception.

And what you state above runs directly counter to your argument.

&gt;However, what this system does deliver is stability and equality under law

If you genuinely believe in equality before the law, you're probably a more hopeless case than I can deal with in a couple of reddit posts, and I say this as someone who worked in the law in a different life.  I can't do better than to be boring and quote my favourite Proudhon again:

""Laws: We know what they are, and what they are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.""

&gt;I am at least not being actively oppressed, nor am I having my rights removed.

Marx, who I don't follow, but I do respect, had a term for that - he called it false consciousness.

&gt;What would direct democracy deliver us? Well everybody would have a say. That sounds nice on paper, but remember, that everybody includes people like this. And there are a lot of them.

Yes, that's true, but it would also do a great deal to prevent people ending up like that in the first place.

&gt;A case in point is the economic crisis - very few people are actually qualified to say what will have a positive impact on the economy, and generally they have studied the subject for years to come to their conclusions. Yet under direct democracy, 'Shardonnay' from Milton Keynes (named after what 'her ma wiz drinkin when she got preggerz') has exactly the same influence on economic policy as a professor of economics at Oxford. And that to me is a terrifying prospect.

Again, I hear what you say, but it was economics professors at Oxford and their brethren and followers who created and led us into the economic crisis in the first place, and then to add insult to injury they neither predicted it nor offered up any workable solutions to it.  Neo-liberal economics is a wash, Keynesian economics just rolls things back to previous failures

&gt;For direct democracy to not result in deporting all the foreigners ""back home"" (doesn't matter if they were born in Birmingham), as well as vigilantism and mob justice, you'd need the vast majority of people to be calm, rational, open minded, well educated and reasonable. Which they aren't.

It is partly funded by council tax from London Boroughs (councils) and mostly by central government. 

The Mayor of London can't change the level of council tax which your local council sets, he can only lower or freeze the amount that goes to the Mayor. Local property such as parks, library's and recycling centres are still run by their respective councils.    

The Mayor is in charge of those services that are London wide, the councils are in charge of those which only effect their boroughs.

Although I note that the increase is measured using the CPI inflation index, rather than RPI, which means that it doesn't include increases in housing costs. A lot of the rise in wealth will have been eaten up because people are competing against each other for a more and more limited supply of housing.

* That the rate of increase has favoured the wealthy, but in a moderately balanced way. Also, in this respect, there's an astonishing difference between the way in which wages increased during the years of mostly Conservative government (1986-1998) compared to mostly Labour government (1998-2011).

The reviews on Just-eat for Ken's Kebabs are an absolute bloodbath, saying that the food was unsanitary, delivered late, delivered cold etc. but I've never had a bad experience with them so far. I won't dare get Ken'sFC for delivery though - last time I did I ordered three of the same meal deal (one for each person in my house) and they managed to put a different quantity of chicken strips in each box, delivered after an hour and a half.

Want a REALLY bad takeaway? Try Andy's Kebabs At The Snack Wagon. Tried to order from there once through Just-eat, they accepted the order, said it would be delivered after 45 minutes. 45 minutes later, no food, called them up and they said ""we don't have a driver, so you're never getting the food"". Just-eat refunded it, bollocked the restaurant for accepting a prepaid order they couldn't fulfil and took them offline for the night. Fine. Gave them a second chance about a month later, the delivery guy came after an hour and a half... or so he said. Swore blind on the phone he was in front of my block, he wasn't. It took me calling both him and the restaurant and laying into them both to acknowledge that my road, one consisting of Victorian tenements and nothing else, does not actually have a building with a clock on the front of it. I don't actually know any buildings with clocks on the front round here, but he was certain there was one down my road.

The kebab was shit too.

My recommendations are Bombay Express (or Curry Leaf, both are great) for curries, Pizza Hot 4 U for pizza, Ken's Kebabs for kebabs (would be Efes in Fratton, who are fucking amazing, but they STILL don't take cards or use Just-eat) and Ken's Fried Chicken. Being an ex-morbidly-obese cunt and spendthrift I know my way around takeaways. Sadly.

Fulham refer to comments made by Brendan Rodgers on the official Liverpool FC website in July relating to their interest in Rodgers.

In addition, a statement appeared on NESN, the club’s owners website, that a deal had been reached for Dempsey’s signature. An apology was later released.

&gt;I see you mention Proudhon, and Marx, so I guess you're either an anarchist (likely given you're talking about mutual consent governance) or a communist. To hold those views, I know exactly what type of view of humanity and the world you need to hold, and I know that I won't shift your views.

Yes, I'm an anarchist, so?  You're a Statist and a capitalist.  I don't dismiss what you believe on that basis.  None of my views are set in stone, that's kind of de rigeur for my philosophy...

&gt;I also know you won't shift mine as I used to be a communist and I now no longer believe any sort of utopia to be possible, least of all a communist one.

Which is fine, and I'm not a communist either, but it's interesting how many ostensible right wing capitalists are currently effusive about communist business models (e.g. Silicon Valley start ups).

&gt;Yes, I'm an anarchist, so? You're a Statist and a capitalist. I don't dismiss what you believe on that basis. None of my views are set in stone, that's kind of de rigeur for my philosophy...

I apologize for my dismissive response; today has not been a good day. Also I got caught up in a long argument with an anarchist the other day and he turned out to have some... interesting views on the holocaust which made me realize that he held a dogmatic position and ignored all counter evidence.

&gt;I don't accept that as either its origin or its current purpose. Originally, government was all about transferring wealth from the poor to the rich, and a great deal of its current function is still about that. To quote a man who greatly inspired me in my youth: ""To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed, legislated at, regulated, docketed, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, assessed, weighed, censored, ordered about, by men who have neither the right, nor the knowledge, nor the virtue.""

You may be surprised to learn that I was paraphrasing the Wealth of Nations. I think that wealth is usually equivalent to power, so we essentially agree on this point.

&gt;&gt;For example I doubt it's any coincidence that the police are more concerned with the kind of petty crime that the underclasses perform than they are with the kind of serious fraud which is perpetrated by the financial elite - the Serious Fraud Office has been seriously flawed and underfunded from it's inception.

&gt;And what you state above runs directly counter to your argument.

Caught me with my pants down slightly there. All I can report is that when I typed that, I wasn't considering equality in the broad sense, but in a narrow, legalistic sense. I have equal rights to own things, not be attacked on the street, vote, etc., but I am not *fully equal* in that the types of crimes I'd be likely to commit are much more widely investigated than the types of crimes that bankers have recently been shown to commit. Of course, the fact that they're now being reported and investigated shows that there is at least some measure of legal equality.

&gt;""Laws: We know what they are, and what they are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.""

I think we will always need laws, as some people are simply not moral. I hold that the basic principle of morality is sympathy (cf. Hume), and without that, we need to enforce reasons to behave on people, or they do terrible things [insert favourite serial killer, etc.].

&gt;&gt;What would direct democracy deliver us? Well everybody would have a say. That sounds nice on paper, but remember, that everybody includes people like this. And there are a lot of them.

&gt;Yes, that's true, but it would also do a great deal to prevent people ending up like that in the first place.

You'll have to elaborate on that. If the majority are closed minded, surely direct democracy will only reinforce and institutionalise their bigotry?

&gt;Again, I hear what you say, but it was economics professors at Oxford and their brethren and followers who created and led us into the economic crisis in the first place, and then to add insult to injury they neither predicted it nor offered up any workable solutions to it. Neo-liberal economics is a wash, Keynesian economics just rolls things back to previous failures

It wasn't academic economists that directly caused the crisis, it was banks that had been left to their own devices taking part in irresponsible lending. If anyone can figure out how to fix the system to close the loopholes that allow that to happen, I'd trust academic experts over the man on the street. To put it another way, if your computer broke, you'd get an IT expert in to look at it, you wouldn't get a few friends round and try to solve the problem by consensus.

&gt;&gt;For direct democracy to not result in deporting all the foreigners ""back home"" (doesn't matter if they were born in Birmingham), as well as vigilantism and mob justice, you'd need the vast majority of people to be calm, rational, open minded, well educated and reasonable. Which they aren't.
&gt;Another product of not having any proper democracy - particularly in the economic system, which is what causes excessive economic migration and outsourcing of jobs etc. in the first place...

Again, could you elaborate? I don't want to invoke a straw man fallacy with my reply.

&gt;Which is fine, and I'm not a communist either, but it's interesting how many ostensible right wing capitalists are currently effusive about communist business models (e.g. Silicon Valley start ups).

Ultimately, our speech is only free if the police, government, and/or media agree with it. This is worrying, and I don't think anyone has the right to be offended.

However, I think there are cases where abuse of free speech amounts to harrassment, and in such cases may the law fall hard on it.

Whether or not that is what is happening in this video, I'm not sure.

If the two guys were offended by the homophobe, they could have moved on to another carriage and ignored him (if you read the description, they were passing him and chose to stop). Therefore, he was arrested because they were offended. That arrest *may* not have happened if his tirade had been about something else.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"The worst part about this Torres is that he loses the ball far too often. He gives it up away so many times that it completely breaks up the tempo and results in us coming under pressure.

Our new midfield is designed in a way that it should retain the ball, even if it loses it, it should be via a calculated risk (i.e a through ball)  and not a mistake like your striker running continuously into a player who starts a counter while your entire midfield was barging forward to attack. That is why we look so week and always under attack through counters, all teams with a Chelsea type midfield would suffer the same way if their player was giving the ball away over and over again. It doesn't matter how many holding mids you put in because sooner or later the other team is going to be good enough to run past all of them retracting back and score.

Even if Torres plays extremely extremely bad as a striker but still manages to not lose the ball, we will have better results than we are having. We will also score more goals regardless of him playing extremely bad. That is how we are going to score goals this season, not by one of our strikers playing like a striker but by retaining the ball until one of those midfield maestros takes it from you, sends it in to the other midfield beauties who score. 

His passing success rate is 68.9%, yes you read that correctly. Counting both the champions league and Premiership and it is not just a ""strikers have to take their chances thing, here are some comparisons :

RVP : 84%

Rooney : 84%

Tevez : 83%

Aguero : 88%

Balotelli : 80%

Ba: 78%

Defoe : 81%

Michu : 79%

Theo FUCKING Walcott (not a striker but gobshite): 80%

Even Lukaku has a better pass rate than him and he I also rate him as losing the ball far too often.

Are you guys not seeing him run into players like he forgot how to play football? Then he falls down most of the time or runs after them after they take the ball away from him resulting in a foul or not even getting the ball back. He fails to make even simple passes, like he has Mata and an opposing player and he hits the opposing player far too often for a professional footballer.

Also I got caught up in a long argument with an anarchist the other day and he turned out to have some... interesting views on the holocaust which made me realize that he held a dogmatic position and ignored all counter evidence.

No apology needed.  There are wankers from every political perspective known to man (woman, child, leftie, rightie, etc.)  No idea on your particular conversation... But irrelevant for the purposes of this one.

&gt;You may be surprised to learn that I was paraphrasing the Wealth of Nations. I think that wealth is usually equivalent to power, so we essentially agree on this point.

I wouldn't be surprised, since I'm a big fan of Adam Smith.  I view him as a proto-socialist of sorts who didn't quite make the necessary connections.  I have little argument with his basic economics, though they've been usefully updated by many people, Ricardo and Marx obviously, but many others since.

&gt;Caught me with my pants down slightly there. All I can report is that when I typed that, I wasn't considering equality in the broad sense, but in a narrow, legalistic sense. I have equal rights to own things, not be attacked on the street, vote, etc., but I am not fully equal in that the types of crimes I'd be likely to commit are much more widely investigated than the types of crimes that bankers have recently been shown to commit. Of course, the fact that they're now being reported and investigated shows that there is at least some measure of legal equality.

I don't think we're greatly opposed here.  There's nothing that makes me more pissed off than middle class lefties talking about the need for touchy feelie rehab and leaving working class people to live on shitty estates with genuine crime.  You know, where people actually get robbed and hurt.  Yes, genuine restructuring of society is the only way to make property crime pointless, but that's not very helpful to a person with a shop on a shitty estate.  But you can sell ""leftie"" progressive law and order polices just by showing they're cheaper and actually fucking work, whereas no ""rightie"" one I'm aware of does...

&gt;I think we will always need laws

I'm not against the concept of law, only the administration of justice.  Personally, I'd go for juror only courts for most cases (with legal advisors), and juror courts supported by expert helpers as well as legal advisors in certain cases requiring technical knowledge.

&gt;You'll have to elaborate on that. If the majority are closed minded, surely direct democracy will only reinforce and institutionalise their bigotry?

I'm assuming, I think with some justice, that racism is a feature if not a product of capitalism (and/or other exploitative economic systems - like feudalism, slavery, etc.).  If you're brought up in economic democracy, the tendency to blame other races or to believe you have some special racial status largely goes away.

&gt;It wasn't academic economists that directly caused the crisis

It was they who devised the means for its execution...

&gt;irresponsible lending

This has become the neo-classical myth, can you justify it in any way?  None of the intelligent analyses of the crisis I've seen say irresponsible lending was at the heart of it.  Have you seen Inside Job?  Most independent analysts, including most people in the banking industry not directly implicated, seem to point to this as the best attempt at an explanation.  And it directly points fingers for fraud and certainly never blames borrowers...

&gt;if your computer broke, you'd get an IT expert in to look at it, you wouldn't get a few friends round and try to solve the problem by consensus.

On the other hand, if your house was burgled, you might do better than to go to the person who stole from you to decide what alarms to install...

Edit: Submitted too soon.  Economic migration is a result of globalisation and corporate capitalism.

It's not the gay couples job to move away from a man throwing insults at them. We live in a society where gay people have the same rights as anyone else and that should be respected. 

Even if the couple weren't gay, and this man was simply being verbally abusive to them, or say they were black and he was being racist, I'd still say the onus is not on the person being harassed to move, as they're not in the wrong.

What seems off to me the most is probably the alignment between ""Doctor Who"" and the episode title, and then clashing a bit farther down with Gaiman's name.  I dunno.

The pictures don't seen *tooooo* far fetched to me, although it does seem a bit odd.  Jenna's picture is probably the oddest, with the shadowy part on the left.  Might be the lack of color making it seem off, though.  Also seems like one would take a better picture of that, but who knows.

I wish we could have a frank discussion about whether or not we, the readers, want this thing here.  

Edit: for the record, the bot deleted a post of mine when I said fuck once.  That's not illegal.  And ""it's a children's show"" is not a valid excuse, because you have to be over 13 to make a reddit account.  Not to mention, I don't think the ""NO MEMES"" discussion that we had last year - at least how I interpreted it - really meant *replies*, only submissions.  

Obviously based on how many upvotes I got and how many downvotes the bot got, clearly the issue is not settled to the satisfaction of the users of the subreddit.

Edit 2:  I have said my peace in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/12tghw/can_we_please_discuss_the_censorship_bot_or/c6y1hh6), and will probably be banned for expressing my opinion, so I suggest everyone go read my swan song, and please, try to let the mods know that this type of thing is absurd and intolerable.

**Edit 3:** As if there were any other picture perfect way of proving my point, my reply to that mod got deleted by the stupid bot!  Here is the content of the post that I linked above, with obfuscated text (another reason the bot is useless).  Quoted bits are the mod /u/Signe and the rest is mine:

____

&gt; Piracy is illegal and has no place on this subreddit, and while the admins may not actively seek out and delete posts or subreddits, it's also against reddit rules. If people want to find pirated content, they can use search engines.

Sure, but ""here is a link to ʇuǝɹɹoʇ ɐ"" is one thing, but ""lol you can check it on ʎɐq ǝʇɐɹıd ǝɥʇ"" is fully another thing, and you know it.  There's a difference between discussion of methods of piracy, and acknowledgement that it exists.  The bot deleted the latter.

And you are hiding behind what you *think* the rules say, when that's [not actually what they say](http://www.reddit.com/rules/), so either you're just lying or you're ignorant of the actual rules.  Neither one is an excuse.  It's against *your rules*, that you made up.

&gt; Memes and other content were removed after discussion by the subreddit and decision by the moderators, so they will be removed with great prejudice. The bot lessens the work that we are required to perform manually in this matter.

Replies, too?  I was pretty sure that was just submitted posts.  That's certainly the intonation of the stuff on the side bar.

**edit:** It even says in [your post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/yljy0/mod_rdoctorwho_goes_memefree/) ""All of these apply only to link submissions, not to self posts (unless the only point is to post the image) or comments.""

&gt; This is a community about a television show that is, ostensibly, a ""children's show."" Blatant slurs against races, sexes, sexual identities, etc. also have no purpose on this subreddit and will also be removed with extreme prejudice.

It's the internet; welcome to it!  Also, Reddit is served on servers based in the United States of America, and according to [15 USC § 6501](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6501) people under the age of 13 cannot legally create a Reddit account.  

And in addition, you *know* that you know that there is a world of difference between racial slurs and coarse language.  You know that, but you lump them together to get some mythical result that you think the rest of us want, when that's clearly not the case.

&gt; It's not a democracy

Ah, the last refuge of the online bully.  I have news for you - Reddit is, at its core, a democracy; or what did you think the upvote and downvote buttons were for?  

&gt; These actions include approving or rejecting posts and comments, **banning users**

So, in light of this threat, I suppose this is likely to be the last thing I'll ever get to post in /r/doctorwho. If that's the case, I sincerely hope - for the sake of your subscribed users - that you guys can manage to see beyond your personal vision, and really listen to your users; return the subreddit to the people, and stop deleting their content against their wishes.

Doctor Who is such serious business for the BBC that Torchwood (An anagram of Doctor Who) was written on the original scripts for this very reason: so someone doesn't find one by mistake and try to profit off of it. Also, have you been missing the whole Neil Gaiman aspect, here? An early script for **one of the hottest shows in the world written by one of the most celebrated sci fi writers** is kind of a big deal and big money. Advertisers pay MILLIONS of dollars to have their ads run for things like this. Having something like this spoiled could potentially cost them MILLIONS. And not just BBC Wales, but BBC America and their other affiliates. And who knows (lol) what information about other episodes might be in there.

The point is, there's a reason that they don't just send these scripts out to fan blogs and newspapers themoment they're written: it's a business. The **suspense** is what keeps us watching.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Rather than studying why the statistics are the way they are, people just want to use statistics. Here are some: if we keep the possession more than a certain % and have a certain number of crosses (30 or something) pr game, we will have huge chance to win the game. This is misuse of statistics, the teams who have possession are the dominant teams, and the teams who cross are usually attacking and pressing high. When you have players unfit to score from set pieces or crosses and your possession comes from playing at the back, you have just misused statistics without actually understanding why they are that way.

I'm glad the statistics are out there, but using statistics without having studied them (something I haven't either), and failing to study the countless different variables as to why they arise is misleading and worthless. Sadly I think statistics have become a way for articles to write themself, I rather read an article on how a certain team had changed their tactics to counter ours, than 2 pages of statistics on why we don't score.

I'm done with statistics and saber-metric/moneyball, not only are they worthless when it comes to how a squad will function, they are misused and a model that has cost us so much.

Luis suarez before Ajax: 15 goals in 37 matches
Falcao before porto: 16 in 35
Aguero before Atleti: 18 in 36
Suarez goal return would never be noticed by us, it's a league where good strikers are expected to top 20 easy, Falcao has returns that wouldn't impress specially for a weaker league and Aguero was looked at but at 20mill you are expecting someone who isn't just a promise.

Within 2 seasons, they had all increased their previous returns by at least 50%, for suarez and falcao double.

Put Henderson and Allen side by side, you will see that they can both reach 90% passing rate and put in couple of tackles, that is far from the reality in which Allen is capable of escaping from pressure and turning the game from defensive to offensive not couple of times, but nearly everything he get's the ball he moves from defensive half to the other, without looking like he will lose the ball. (I do quite like Henderson, and they are different players, but statistics of passing and pass completion will ignore the more important aspects of the game).

I would have loved if KK had a decent director, who would have bought good players for cheap, but instead we got statistically good players for more than they are worth. He had us playing good football regardless and we had such a nice record at home for his first 2 halves. We can't change anything, but we will still be there if we do not fix a simple obvious problem that doesn't require statistical look, but rather a footballing one. Get someone to score the goals suarez can't, in the games suarez can't and at least you can be sure that we will stay in top 4.",0,1352323994,null,0,false,0,c6xyydf,t3_12tdtv,t1_c6xyydf,t3_12tdtv,null,1430347057,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

* We need to take a page out of Shakhtar's book. They keep their passing ridiculously simple yet they carved through our midfield and defense like a knife through warm butter. Sometimes we are guilty of overplaying and sometimes everyone is just standing around wondering what they should do. There is still a lot of room to improve as far as team cohesion goes. There are pockets of good stuff but there's got to be more.

* Anyone else think that bringing Sturridge on in the 90th minute was ridiculously strange?

I have a friend from Jersey (tiny island off the coast of England) who was turned down because she was ineligible for any funding. I don't think an American has any chance.

If you are really exceptional, you might get a UK company to sponsor you to study, but it's unlikely. For that, you want to be googling ""CASE studentships"" which have the industrial partner who pays. Even if that is the case, they're unlikely to want to fund only an MSc. Masters are typically useless and most masters students achieve very little. The company will obviously want some return on investment, like a published paper using their product. You really need a 4yr PhD to actually get something done, unless you find some sort of blue sky exploratory idea to research into.

These statistics are well-presented and logical, though; I mean, you can argue over the definition of what counts as a clear-cut chance, but the number we've created is so small and so far off other teams that changing the metric won't close that gap much. The game that summed this up best was Newcastle - everyone says we dominated that game, when in fact we didn't, really - we dominated possession, but frequently didn't do anything meaningful with it. The fact that two of our wide players are teenagers is really showing (even though they've both performed better than expected).

The stat about the number of shots in the 6-yard box was new. The author attributes it to a lack of patience, which is partly true, but it's also due to the way our front 3 are set up - Suarez is a 'false 9', which means he's not going to be attacking the 6-yard box as frequently as a normal striker. Instead, the players around him should be attacking the space he creates, but that isn't happening enough from the likes of Suso, Sahin and Sterling.

&gt; Piracy is illegal and has no place on this subreddit, and while the admins may not actively seek out and delete posts or subreddits, it's also against reddit rules. If people want to find pirated content, they can use search engines.

Sure, but ""here is a link to a torrent"" is one thing, but ""lol you can check it on the pirate bay"" is fully another thing, and you know it.  There's a difference between discussion of methods of piracy, and acknowledgement that it exists.  The bot deleted the latter.

And you are hiding behind what you *think* the rules say, when that's [not actually what they say](http://www.reddit.com/rules/), so either you're just lying or your ignorant of the actual rules.  Neither one is an excuse.  It's against *your rules*, that you made up.

&gt; Memes and other content were removed after discussion by the subreddit and decision by the moderators, so they will be removed with great prejudice. The bot lessens the work that we are required to perform manually in this matter.

Replies, too?  I was pretty sure that was just submitted posts.  That's certainly the intonation of the stuff on the side bar.

**edit:** It even says in [your post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/yljy0/mod_rdoctorwho_goes_memefree/) ""All of these apply only to link submissions, not to self posts (unless the only point is to post the image) or comments.""

&gt; This is a community about a television show that is, ostensibly, a ""children's show."" Blatant slurs against races, sexes, sexual identities, etc. also have no purpose on this subreddit and will also be removed with extreme prejudice.

It's the internet; welcome to it!  Also, Reddit is served on servers based in the United States of America, and according to [15 USC § 6501](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6501) people under the age of 13 cannot legally create a Reddit account.  

And in addition, you *know* that you know that there is a world of difference between racial slurs and coarse language.  You know that, but you lump them together to get some mythical result that you think the rest of us want, when that's clearly not the case.

&gt; It's not a democracy

Ah, the last refuge of the online bully.  I have news for you - Reddit is, at its core, a democracy; or what did you think the upvote and downvote buttons were for?  

&gt; These actions include approving or rejecting posts and comments, **banning users**

So, in light of this threat, I suppose this is likely to be the last thing I'll ever get to post in /r/doctorwho. If that's the case, I sincerely hope - for the sake of your subscribed users - that you guys can manage to see beyond your personal vision, and really listen to your users; return the subreddit to the people, and stop deleting their content against their wishes.",0,1352333125,null,0,1352334358,0,c6y1hh6,t3_12tghw,t1_c6y1hh6,t1_c6y046t,null,1430348282,-2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-2

true,sylvan,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;Sure, but ""here is a link to a torrent"" is one thing, but ""lol you can check it on the pir-ate bay"" is fully another thing, and you know it. There's a difference between discussion of methods of piracy, and acknowledgement that it exists. The bot deleted the latter.

This subreddit is not really the appropriate forum for general discussion of copyright issues. The overwhelmingly common reason to reference TPB is to provide torrent links or direct users there. Thus, these references are removed.

&gt;And you are hiding behind what you think the rules say, when that's not actually what they say, so either you're just lying or your ignorant of the actual rules. Neither one is an excuse.

We were previously contacted by a Reddit admin, and told to crack down on copyright infringements or facing having the subreddit deleted.

I have since asked for clarification on exactly what is and is not allowed, and my request was ignored.

Until we get such clarification, we err on the side of caution. No links to torrents, streaming sites, or the like, and no references to the names of such sites. Users interested in such sites can *easily* find them elsewhere.

&gt;It even says in your post ""All of these apply only to link submissions, not to self posts (unless the only point is to post the image) or comments.""

That's the meme-free policy, not the anti-piracy policy.

&gt;And in addition, you know that you know that there is a world of difference between racial slurs and coarse language.

Slurs against race, gender, or sexual orientation are simply not welcome here. They are not excusable simply as ""coarse language"". 

&gt;I have news for you - Reddit is, at its core, a democracy; or what did you think the upvote and downvote buttons were for?

The admins of reddit have described their model of the site as based on IRC. Anyone is free to create a subreddit, and it is up to the mods of that reddit to manage it as they see fit.

We want /doctorwho/ to feature higher quality content &amp; discussions [no memes], be generally welcoming [no slurs], and not be shut down for inappropriate content [no piracy]. Our actions are consistent with that vision.

&gt;So, in light of this threat, I suppose this is likely to be the last thing I'll ever get to post in /r/doctorwho.

We do not issue bans lightly. Discussing the moderation policies or critiquing them civilly are absolutely fine.

&gt;that you guys can manage to see beyond your personal vision, and really listen to your users; return the subreddit to the people, and stop deleting their content against their wishes.

As has been noted and discussed by moderators across reddit, including many of the largest subreddits, content quality is typically in a ""race to the bottom"" of meme posts, rage comics, etc. *unless moderation policies prevent it*. To cultivate a higher-quality level of content, low-quality posts must be removed.

/r/DoctorWhumour exists to house meme images and similar now, leaving /r/doctorwho to be a fan community more about the fans themselves and discussion of the show, rather than endless trivial memes.

We welcome constructive feedback and input on how the subreddit is run. However, I, and I believe other mods, see the meme-free policy as a success. The piracy policy is, again, until we hear otherwise from the admins, non-negotiable. And racist, sexist, and homophobic/transphobic slurs have no place in a community that welcomes diversity in its participants, and about a show that celebrates that same diversity.

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"Sure, it may make a mistake here and there, and it will do in this thread when you're talking about what it gets rid of, but I've taken a look at the history and like I said, besides for that rare mistake, I can't say there's anything in there that I wouldn't remove myself, besides from one or two of the self-posts deleted without a body. It just (usually) gets there first.

If you have an issue with what it removes, the rules are what you need to discuss. Not the bot.

I'm not sure what the problem is exactly. Censorship? All it's removing is posts that are either a)Illegal, b)Go elsewhere on reddit, c)Not detailed enough or d)Foul language.

In the cases of Illegal...well it shouldn't be posted anyway. Link or not, Most people (I hope) can just as easily use google as me to find the content. Just because a direct link isn't being provided, doesn't mean it's not directing the user there.

In the case of ""Elsewhere on reddit"", that's hardly censorship. It's basically the reddit equivalent of a moderator on a forum deleting (because we can't just ""move it"") a thread because some idiot ""forgot"" to read the rules or the category title and posted it in the wrong place.

In the case of a self-post not being ""detailed enough"", that's simple. Repost it with a body.

In the case of foul language, Yes. This is the internet. There will be foul language, which is why it's very very relaxed for a language filter. Having said that, there are still children on here (Just because it's illegal for under 13s to create an account, doesn't mean to say they're not here). It only tends to remove the more severe bad language, mostly insults over just general.

But all in all, to be frank, when I read messages and comments from the ""against"" party (and it is only people who are against it) who feel the need to more or less insult (either directly or indirectly) the users or the mods in a discussion, usually because they can't argue for their side enough, then my fingers are either going to be sticking up towards the user, or going in my ears.",0,1352335554,moderator,0,false,0,c6y231w,t3_12tghw,t1_c6y231w,t3_12tghw,null,1430348621,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5
true,xiaodown,null,null,"(I am enjoying this dialogue, but let's trim down the size of these posts, we look like we're collectively writing Tolstoy... axing a bunch of stuff out)

I'm not mad about the meme free policy.  And to be honest, while on principle, I don't support it, I understand getting rid of inappropriate sexual content and racial slurs.  Since the bot was recently changed to not delete posts that contain swear words, I'm fine with the bot's stance on abusive language.

I also (reluctantly) understand erring on the side of caution where it comes to not allowing Reddit admins to take away the subreddit, if they have specifically cited the availability of pirated materials as an area of concern.  I am quite upset that you asked for clarification and did not receive any - perhaps it's time to revisit that with Reddit?  They've recently added to their staff; perhaps they would be more likely to respond.

My objections are more along the lines of having a bot do it.  The bot cannot be smart; doing a simple regular expression match for TBP is going to catch a lot of stuff like the deleted post that started this whole mess today. 

I really feel very strongly that this should be done by humans; human eyes, human brains, human fingers.  The fact that there are seven moderators for a sub with over a hundred thousand users seems to me to be the problem; the bot would seem to be a bad solution to a problem that's probably not as severe as you think it is (memes aside).

The simple answer is that you need probably ten times the number of moderators that you have, coupled with a set of very clear guidelines on how the moderators should act, and a comprehensive onboarding procedure to train them.

Guy was picked up by transport police officers, who held him overnight and sent him on his way with a caution. This is how 99% of public order offences are dealt with. The goal of UK police in that situation is generally to try and end that matter as quickly as possible and try and ensure the behaviour is stopped. YMMV how effective this is.

The more severe sentences came when the videos were made public, BEFORE the arrest of the perpetrator, leading to a public outcry. The matter was then dealt with by more senior officers and the CPS, leading to a court imposed (and inherently harsher) punishment.

Its this mechanism which has led to tweeters getting such ridiculous sentences-  once it reaches the police attention it is necessarily in the public eye, leading to a ridiculous over response, compared to that of someone actually threatening and abusing someone in person. Or, indeed, hitting them and wounding them. British courts are in many ways lenient, but are ridiculously media sensitive.

That said, it is still my observation that homphpbic offenses get far less severe punishments than racist ones. Hacks me off I have to say.
