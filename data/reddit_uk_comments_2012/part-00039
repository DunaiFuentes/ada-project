We leave frustrated because we were much better than Chelsea. In Lisbon we also lost with weird factors. - Derp. We lost home and away, but we were better. No, it's not that we shit ourselves when in front of goal. Or the opponents played deep so they could counter us. Nope.
Today, when we were in command, we were cut down. Even if we hadn't won but we did not deserve to be defeated. I'm very proud of the players, they also felt they were superior. We were much more of a team than Chelsea team over the two rounds."" - But they lost...twice...

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Ivanovic is clearly our best RB. Cahill/Luiz may be better pure defenders from a central position, but there is no way that either of them would defend better at RB than Ivanovic. Plus, he gives us our best chance to score from set pieces which is one of the best (and maybe only) chances we will have to put the ball in the net.

I think we will have to park the bus and ride it out at the Nou Camp, but we are going to have to defend well, counter attack with some real pace, and score goals at the Bridge to have any chance going into the second leg. I think it is important to have quick players up front in the first leg who can get from defense to attack quickly (Sturridge, Ramires, Torres, Mata). In the second leg, we should field a team full of solid defenders, Mikel/Essien/Ramires in midfield, maybe Malouda/Mata on the flanks and Drogba up front. We will need every man in defense we can get, but in the first leg, we can't be afraid to try to score.

I also don't think that passing out of the back is the Achilles heel of Barca... It might be their greatest strength because other teams over-pursue in the attacking half and get stretched out.

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt; The Online Safety Bill, if enacted, would place a ""duty"" on ISPs and mobile network operators that provide internet access services to ""provide a service that excludes pornographic images"" by default.

&gt; Only if subscribers aged over 18 actively ""opt-in"" to access the adult content would the ISPs and operators allow the material to be accessed, and even then access would have to be denied unless the ISP ""has an age verification policy which has been used to confirm that the subscriber is aged 18 or over"". The bill is currently under consideration in the House of Lords.

**&lt;INSERT ISP NAME HERE&gt;, can I have a wank please?**

Seriously, fuck this legislation. Not only would it be quite expensive and very inconvenient for ISPs to implement but it would be stupid because it would be so easy for anybody with a bit of computer knowledge to bypass.

Next of all, how are we going to prove that we are 18 or above? Will there be a prompt that will let us easily lie about our age thus making this legislation redundant? Will we have to ring up our ISP and fax them our fucking drivers licence or passport just to prove our age? Will we have to do this every time we want to engage in an online wank-fest?

true,railu,tennant,Tennant,"The way I look at it is, each Doctor represents a stage in life and that's where most people come to identify with a particular incarnation and also why that changes.

The 9th Doctor is the result of the Time War.  He's been there, done that, survived but feels responsible to protect the universe since there really isn't anyone else left who can.  He puts the weight of the universe on his shoulders and Rose is the one who changes that.  He locks her in the TARDIS and sends her back not just because he fears for her safety, but because he genuinely believes he can't put his trust in anyone else.  Her overcoming that, returning and being the one who saved him and the earth made him realize he could.  Regenerating can easily be interchangeable with epiphany in this version.  He became a ""new man"".  If you feel you're fighting the good fight by yourself, hardened but longing for others then this is an easy Doctor to identify with.

The 10th Doctor is about dealing with self-loathing and acceptance.  He's learned and now wants to move on but can't manage on his own.  He's been given a new chance at life, but can't quite escape his old habits.  His change in attitude towards humanity isn't an accident either.  As the 9th in ""Rose"", he is very dismissive of humans and thinks people just want to eat snacks and watch television.  As each season with Tenant goes on, he starts to see humanity as so much more and himself as so much less.  He's like a parent watching his children growing up and no longer needing him.  He's happy that they are becoming independent, but is afraid to lose his identity which is why near the end he becomes so defiant of his own rules.  Even his final act is essentially ""letting go"" and because the people he raised can take care of themselves now.  It's easy to be a fan of this version of the Doctor because we all start to feel inadequate and question ourselves when we see the world passing us by.

The 11th Doctor is about change and finding jubilation in the ashes.  He basically lost everything and was given a clean slate.  He represents new and exciting change, freedom and terrifying new responsibility.  I think this is why so many college-aged and young adult are big fans of this incarnation.  He's about discovering who he really is and realizing his own power and then what happens when you take it too far.  He feels like he's been pulled along one too many times and now it's his turn and won't tolerable it any more.  He's about shedding the past, defying the rules and getting what you want and giving everything to the ones you love.  He's definitely the most fool hearty of the new Doctors.

In fact, the fall of every Doctor is the result of just being too damn stubborn--the unwillingness to accept that what's done is done and move on.  To accept a helping hand, to trust, to have faith in others, to admit that he was wrong would have saved him many times.  But then again he also wouldn't need to grow up.

That's just my analysis.  Others might disagree.  I'm a Matt Smith fan too for pretty much the reasons I just outlined.",0,1333655812,null,0,false,0,c48wgek,t3_ruxit,t1_c48wgek,t3_ruxit,null,1435723846,53,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,53

More seriously, I mostly had an issue with Donna's... personality.  I disliked her sass and how she always seemed to default to screeching. How she reacted to things just got on my nerves, but this was less of an issue as the season(s) progressed.

Rose had the benefit of being the first companion that I had known (as I'm sure is the Ninth was the first doctor for a lot of people as well).  I liked the interactions with the Doctor, Rickey, and Rose.  One of my favorite characters arcs for the companion was Rose trying to reconcile whether the Doctor was the same person after he regenerated.

That's not to say I'm enamored with Rose. She did have the annoying habit of completely ignoring the Doctor's advice at times (Let's save Dad, Time can handle it!).

Martha was a character that I liked overall. She was intelligent and had a personality I did like overall.  Conversely, I don't remember much of what happened with her, so perhaps my opinion would change on a second time through, but she left a mostly favorable impression.  

Amelia might be my favorite overall, but the ambiguity of whether she had fallen for the Doctor over Rory annoyed me a bit.

&gt;I doubt, however, whether the unemployed would ultimately benefit if 
they learned to spend their money more economically. For it is only the 
fact that they are not economical that keeps their allowances so high. An 
Englishman on the P.A.C. gets fifteen shillings a week because fifteen 
shillings is the smallest sum on which he can conceivably keep alive. If he 
were, say, an Indian or Japanese coolie, who can live on rice and onions, 
he wouldn't get fifteen shillings a week -- he would be lucky if he got 
fifteen shillings a month. Our unemployment allowances, miserable though 
they are, are framed to suit a population with very high standards and not 
much notion of economy. If the unemployed learned to be better managers 
they would be visibly better off, and I fancy it would not be long before 
the dole was docked correspondingly. 

I think Orwell was maybe onto something here.

I feel that your breakfast would meet both of those requirements.

It may be because the format of the pre-2005 episodes is extended into multiple episodes, so it progresses more slowly and I'd have to watch two or even three segments of the series before I really start to get a feel for them.  Or it could be that I'm spoiled by current production values, but I doubt it because I still love watching old episodes of Star Trek, terrible effects and all.  I'm going to keep trying, because I would really like to eventually watch through them all and see the various portrayals of the Doctor instead of only having experienced five of them (Tom Baker and the eighth through 11th Doctors).

I do support local businesses when their produce and service is superior - and the local butcher clearly falls within both categories. They do a rather fine chilli pie too...

After all, who would know the meat better than the man who has cleaved it from the carcass?

I have sampled this thing, that passes for breakfast, in the colonies... What they call bacon quite clearly is not, which is a travesty.

Thank you, the sentiments are appreciated, especially as you are from the blue group! 

&gt;When you say you have no idea what should be done I say top to bottom tax reform with massive investment in public shared equity property investment to reassess the lack of council housing, with like you say, housing benefits available to re-appropriation.

That is the trouble with Tory policy at the moment, it doesn't take a wide enough view. Where I am, there is a severe desperate shortage of council housing, because they were all sold off and no more were built, as was promised. ( myopic in the extreme). So now low income families are stuck in higher rent private housing, higher in comparison to council rents for the same accommodation. This has contributed in no small part to the huge housing benefit bill, because the same family would be entitled to HB in either council or private rents. My local council will offer money to people in oversized council property, to move to a smaller place, oversized meaning they have more space than they need/would be entitled too. The money is usually in the range of 2 or 3 thousand depending on the property and the amount of downsizing. But they do not have the power to force the person to move, meaning that property is tied up until that person moves or dies. While I can sympathise with people who want to stay in the houses that they have 'done up', council housing should be more transient, a secure rent for life, but not always in the same property. 

The current social and economic problems have arisen because of lots of small factors, like the one above, contributing to exasperate existing problems. The Tory's ideal of 'making it so everyone will want to work' is fantasy because the jobs are simply not there to be had. They seem to be based on the lazy workshy element, which is a minority despite what the tabloids would like us to think. Incidentally, there are no other parties, at present that have taken a wider view either, certainly not Labour. I am about as far left as you can get, boarding socialist and with definite anarchic streak! It seems to come as a surprise ( to the hard of thinking usually) that a leftie would be spouting on about making people leave their homes, encouraging work etc etc but it is a common sense view that happens to agree with some who have a more blue view to things.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"I read a few really interesting articles on poverty that have made me think differently about things. One is that the poorer you are the more likely you are to make bad financial decisions and the decisions you make are likely to affect you harder. The reasoning was that when you spend everyday struggling to make ends meet, you're likely to be clouded in judgement when it comes to taking the time to decide on something rationally and impulse decide on the outcome which benefits you best in the short term, but are often worst in the long term and the negative association with financial decisions means you're unlikely to spend the time thinking about the big picture or planning how they can improve your finances and just ignore them, disassociating yourself from the bad feelings thinking about it gives. 
The way they are hit harder is in things like pay meters for electricity, debt charges, late fee's, interest, not using Direct Debit ect which just reinforces the negative cycle. 

The other thing read was about food poverty in India and how when rice prices dropped, it did nothing to increase consumption, people still ate just enough. Instead the people spent the extra money they had on things they couldn't afford before. The point the author make was that people want to enjoy their lives however poor they are and a new T.V offers more enjoyment than increased nutrition, or least people perceived it to. It also discussed the trap of poor eating and low productivity, if you don't eat well then you will not be able to function at work or finding work and it creates a viscous cycle. The second one was focussed on India where benefit barley exist, but it could be relevant anywhere. Will try and find them.  

Personally I think food vouchers would not be bad thing, especially if they were valid on fresh fruit and veg locally grown. Something like £10 a week of benefits given could only be spent on specific healthy food.

up. The people are in effect living a reduced version of their former

tolerable by lowering their standards.

One policy I would advocate, and probably very few others would, is giving heroin away cheaply on the NHS to addicts. People do not want to fund drug abuse, obviously, but the tax payer *already does* to a huge degree by people spending benefits (including money intended for children) on heroin.

In my opinion, the best and easiest way is to start with the 2005 series.

But if you do start with Eccleston, seriously do NOT forget to go back and watch the older ones. They are fantastic additions to the series, and shouldn't be swept under the rug.

A couple of months ago I had some kid arrive at my wee house while he was going door to door for a gas supplier, my housemate let him in (WHY?!) and during his pitch I distinctly recall him saying that 'all gas and electric suppliers charge exactly the same prices because it all comes from the National Grid, so the only way you can save is by monitoring your consumption and trying to cut down what you use.' He'd obviously never paid his own bills in his life, he was blathering on, and I had no intention of switching. 

So, I wanted him gone but, alas, I'm horrifically bad at getting rid of anyone like that in anything approaching a normal sort of way, so I thought I'd just make him very uncomfortable, though it ended up with me just having fun. I keep a modest collection of medieval weaponry, so I introduced him to it and then steadily built his involvement in some demonstrations - swinging a blunt sword at him in quarter-speed, then half-speed, him trying to keep concentrating on his clipboard and question-asking all the while. I'd sort of hoped I'd end up suggesting he let me William Tell an apple off his head with a crossbow - not that I'd be so stupid as to *actually* do that - but he chickened out well before it got that far. Probably a good thing.

Now their silhouettes are masculine, but in-Whoniverse, they have no gender. In real life, yes there's probably some inherent unconscious sexism there, but in Whoniverse it makes sense. Women have thinner limbs than men, so less strength whether you're a Sontaran or a Cyberman. Less space for muscles/circuits. So it makes sense that they would have more masculine arms. Neither have breasts because..well neither give birth or have to nurse offspring. What's the point to breasts? Same with the crotch.

Also, they only seem all male to us humans because they resemble our definition of masculinity. It goes the other way as well- all the weeping angels appear feminine (doubt they have gender) and Movellans are pretty effeminate. You could ask why they're all black too and call that racism.

Making all races look masculine/feminine/a certain race/etc is a way to show that they're part of the same species. At most, this reveals that humans are bigoted because we judge by gender and color. But that's just a fact of life.

But how are the Daleks male? They don't even resemble humans or have feminine or masculine qualities in design. At most you could say that their aggressive attitude is what makes them masculine. But that's just our human sexism and ideas about males being the ""aggressive"" ones getting in the way.

The Daleks' aggressive attitude isn't based on resembling the ""better"" gender, it's about survival. In order to survive they have to have zero threats which means eliminating all opposition. It's logical. It's not our fault that the males in our species tend to be more aggressive, but that's no reason to think that females can't be vicious.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I'll just give you the usual induction :)

Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. 

Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1333671649,null,0,false,0,c48znjs,t3_rvgb5,t1_c48znjs,t3_rvgb5,null,1428664334,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

1.  She says their lives are ""back-to-front"" and that her past is his future and vice versa.  This means that the moment they meet, he knows everything about her and she knows nothing.  This was repeated a few different times.  This means once they reached the point of no return, they can't go back.

2.  She mentions early on that they simply meet ""in the wrong order"" and that she needs the ""spotters guide"" to identify him.  This was a bit of a plot device to explain how she could so easily identify the 10th in The Library/Forest of the Dead, but this makes a loophole.

I personally think that's just being lazy but sometimes laziness pays off in that Moffat can just say that they don't necessarily have to meet exactly in reverse chronological order.

true,Morvis42,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Here's my opinion, start with Season 3 Episode 10 of the new 2005- reboot called ""Blink"". (In England they call a season a series so it's not just Doctor Who but every british show is like this) Blink is usually considered the best Doctor Who episode even though the Doctor is not in it all that much. It is a perfectly self contained episode and plays more like a short film then an episode of a television show. It also does a pretty good job of providing backstory because the character that the episode focuses on is only in that one episode and so you get to know The Doctor as she gets to know The Doctor. Then from there I would start with the first episode of the 2005- reboot called ""Rose"". Wherever you start though I'm sure you're going to love it. But don't let the episode Rose turn you off of the show. It is a little bit of a weaker episode but I appreciate it more after going back and watching the old series because the monster they bring back for the 1st episode of the reboot is one from the classic episodes but not one of the big 3; Daleks, Cybermen, The Master. So they reference the old monsters right from the start but they don't blow their wad right at the beginning.

Well, not really. Let me go in deeper (uhm... that sounded better in my head). Daleks are never referred to as ""he"", I don't think. And seeing as they're basically just a mutated form in a tank there's no real gender involved with Daleks anymore. Every time we see someone rise up a new army of Daleks it's either through the conversion of others or the extrapolation from one gene set. There doesn't seem to be any procreation at all. In fact, as Ritch says the *lack* of gender, not the presence of one or dominance of only one, removes humanity, removes diversity.

Look how relevant this is to the show guys. It feels like I'm a companion to the Doctor now.

Then there are those posts with: the trademark scarf, a picture/drawing of a dalek saying something inane, someone making a Who reference on a different subreddit, totally irrelevant pictures of actors that were on the show at one point, and some shitty picture your kid drew of a tardis.

But none of these are as bad as putting people down for not watching the show. Some people just aren't interested in some things. Don't act like watching this show makes you better than other people.

true,thefluttershytree,tennant,Tennant,"I've had the same feeling. I really enjoy some of Moffat's writing because he makes it a point to treat the audience like they're intelligent, and he can be very good at psychological thrillers. Blink, Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, and Night Terrors were brilliantly terrifying. Plus, his overlying arcs are somewhat reminiscent of Classic Who's serials. 

The problem I have is that he kind of ends up shooting himself in the foot by putting some of the very good writing early on and setting up these ridiculously complicated solutions, but then taking an easy out. When he's good, he's very good, but the rest of the time he is fairly mediocre, which is a problem because he has set up such high expectations. There was a lot of hype about Wedding of River Song especially, but I was very disappointed by the way it turned out. It was supposed to be the big climax of series 6, but it ended up being one of the weakest episodes of the series. 

The second thing I've noticed is that everything has to be an epic. There's no camp to balance things out. That's surprising, frankly, when you remember that this is coming from the man who invented the Sofa of Reasonable Comfort (if you haven't seen the Curse of Fatal Death, I urge you to go find it on YouTube immediately). The universe is terrifying, yes, but it's also wonderful. The core of this show is a madman in a box who's out to see all of space and time and the beauty and wonder and ridiculousness therein, but Moffat is writing it more like an epic quest. I can't think of one straight-up moment of hilarity (amusement, yes, hilarity, no) in series 5 and 6 combined off the top of my head, and that troubles me. There needs to be a balance.

That's not to say it's been all bad. The Doctor's Wife was, in my opinion, one of the best episodes of all time. Matt Smith's acting (which wasn't bad to start with) just keeps getting better. River can be fun too, though not quite as much now that we know her whole backstory. Rory's character development has been brilliant.

true,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"I've spent a lot of time trying to pin down what the difference is as well.  I think one notable aspect worth pointing out is that pretty much ALL of Moffat's great scripts were written when he was under RTD.  I think he's one of those writers who simply needs an editor to keep him in check, and to tell him when he's got a bad idea.  

Also, though, I find that a lot of the S5 and S6 episodes are less structurally sound than in the S1-4 run.  The people writing them don't seem to be paying enough attention to proper plotting and how to set up major plot swerves so that they don't seem totally out of the blue.  That's not to say that every episode under RTD was a masterpiece, but even the bad episodes are generally architecturally sound.  They honestly tried to *sell* the plot twists, rather than just having them happen.

A lot of the recent episodes remind me of the breathless way a twelve year old tells a story.  ""This happened and then this happened and then there were DINOSAURS and then Hitler showed up but we locked him in a closet and then ...""  The plot just races ahead, without any real attempt at internal consistency.  In the same fashion, cool ideas are brought up and then forgotten just as quickly.  (Wouldn't it have been niftier to further explore the mashed-up world of ""The Wedding of River Song"" than to only use it for establishing shots and then move the action to a generic underground base for most of the episode?)

Finally, I also find the new seasons to have less subtlety.  One thing I liked about RTD's run is that he was aware of things like race and class issues.  They factored into the stories, and gave them a bit of depth for the adults to pick up on.  Notice how Rose, for example, being working class, generally tended to gravitate towards fellow workers and used them to pick up extra information.  (Or the resentment between her and Cassandra was CLEARLY class-based.)  The same goes for when it touched on racial and sexual issues.  There were undertones there which fleshed it out and made it feel a little more grown-up, without interfering with the main plots or making it too dense for the kiddies.

Him riding off into the sunset for one last adventure, which we never see - and that adventure being so traumatic that it not only caused a regeneration, but changed his character entirely, giving us 9.

true,bkharmony,null,null,"Yes. This exactly.

My belief is Moffat creates episodes with a series of ""iconic images""* in mind, and marries them to a handful of plot points he needs to hit in order to advance the series. This, if true, would mean all the organic stuff that happens between characters is forced, if included at all, and often seems synthetic. The threads one would normally follow are not followed, and characters sometimes behave oddly because the point is not to tell a story and enjoy the way humans (and Gallifreyans) interact with the story, but to create a series of postcard moments and move along the established story arc.

Let me guess - you loved ""Vincent and the Doctor."" Most of us did. This episode was, to me, much more like the Tennant/Eccleston outings, and it was clearly an outlier in the Moffat/Smith series. To me, it had an organic nature and a human structure to it that most of Moffats' work no longer has (but once did; see ""The Girl in the Fireplace,"" an episode filled with great imagery and ideas, but which also seemed to be written by a human being).

I'm still not sure how to phrase this, but I'm throwing it out there anyway.

*By ""iconic images,"" I mean such things as ""The Impossible Astronaut."" While looking quite cool, it made absolutely no sense. Another example would be Madame Kavarian's eye patch. Though cool, and later sorta explained, it seemed like a retcon designed simply to explain a cool character design. For another example, look at practically anything in the last Christmas special.

true,writerbynature7,null,null,"I'm with you there. Martha didn't redeme herself in my eyes until she came back for those few episodes in season 4 and in Torchwood, then she was her own character.  At the same time I think Martha got the short end of the stick a bit. 

Rose starts off as just a shop girl, there is nothing amazing waiting at home for her, just micky and her mom and in comparison to the doctor they are nothing. So in her mind she is going to see the universe, and she doesn't have to ever give it up. She could travel for all of time with him. and so this is how she feels about it. She doesn't have to push the doctor or their relationship at all, because she has the rest of time to do that. It isn't until she's locked in another universe that it hits her she won't get to spend the rest of her life with him and that's when she admits to being in love with him. Yes we all knew it happened earlier but she was happy enough being his mate for now, and having all sorts of fun adventures and leaving the romance to later. (Also remember she was only 19 when he first took her, so she had a long life ahead of her)

Now Martha is different, she's going to be a doctor. She has stuff she has to get home for. Hell, her entire season, actually happens in 4 earth days (Once the timeline is reset and the year that never was, never was). She was only gone for 4 days, and though out all those travels Martha is looking for a reason to not go home. In her mind if the doctor loved her back, she could give up being a Doctor, and save the world this way instead, it would be a trade off, but if the doctor loved her back it would be worth it. The problem is that she cannot get out from underneath the shadow of Rose, and the Doctor's love for Rose.  Once she does (When she returns for Torchwood and season 4 of DW) then she's a pretty awesome character. 

When the doctor tells Rose that it travels in time, she's thinking of her past, and her father, and the future and all the interesting things in history she can see and all the interesting things in the future she can see. When the doctor tells Martha it travels in time, she's thinking ""I can have lifetimes of adventure, and still come back just ten minutes later."" 

Donna is similar to Rose. She's ""just a temp"" she doesn't really have much to get home too.

true,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"I think this is bang on, personally.  I've constantly felt like the interpersonal stuff seemed forced.  Like practically every element of River's backstory, for one thing.  Can ANYONE actually explain that tangle in a way that makes any real logical sense?  Not to mention the constant nagging feeling like the writers wanted to give the Doctor a girlfriend, while looking for a shortcut around having to actually do real character writing.  We're supposed to take on faith that, at some point in the (Doctor's) future, they have some great romance, but *we never actually see it.*  And, honestly, I feel like she and Smith have zero romantic chemistry and little reason to be so entangled, except that the plot requires it.  

They can't even keep their own story straight, saying in one episode that their meetings are exactly reversed from each other chronologically for the sake of a big weepy scene, then tossing that out the window the next time it became inconvenient.  (The events of ""Let's Kill Hitler"" *should* have been the Doctor's very last encounter with her, for example, if the previous story were true.)

Another thing that annoys me is the lack of real *impact* on the characters from the things going on.  Look at Rory.  While it's debatable whether the reality in which he had his, er, extended sabbatical still exists, he CLEARLY retained the memories and skills of those years.  Yet, he acts exactly the same way as he did at the start of his episodes, despite now [spoiler](/s ""subjectively being twice as old as the Doctor."")  You think that would change a man beyond just giving him some sweet fighting skills.

Same with Amy.  There's zero sign that she's learned anything or grown from her experiences, despite desperately *needing* to grow up some.  Hell, if nothing else, you'd at least expect her to punch the Doctor every time he calls her ""The girl who waited"" like it's a cute nickname.  He's ruined her life multiple times by making her wait.

I thought that RTD's standard season ender of ""Companion gets badass abilities and saves the Doctor's ass"" started getting a bit stale, but at least it allowed him to emphasize how much the characters had changed thanks to their time with the Doctor.

But ether way, the lack of character growth and development is absolutely symptomatic of a writing strategy that focuses on the plot and big events, and sees characters as just a means to that end.",0,1333706492,null,0,true,0,c494j6m,t3_rvnzm,t1_c494j6m,t1_c493xmr,null,1428666700,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

If councils invested into public shared-equity properties, and if housing benefits instead of being 'lost money' counted towards a deposit and mortgage payments, even if it was only 10% of a property share would you be inclined?  Arguably somebody that is mid term term tenant could save up a deposit.

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"Isn't this interesting that this comes up when we the public are in opposition to surveillance.  David Cameron seems to think all the public needs to know is the balance sheet, money in and what results come out.  Well i think he is sadly mistaken.  

Money in and results out are completely irreverent.  We already know that we are going to borrow 160 something billion plus 120 billion in taxes collected to run the country.  That is a staggering 280 billion to run things.

Be that as it may that is only 4,666 for ever man woman and child in the country.  5702 ofr every adult.  and that equates to about 7000 for working aged people.  Calculate in unemployed people that brings us up to 7685.  Then add in for those who are on health benifits  which brings us up to 8276.  Then of course there is the working poor who do not pay in, so working people able to pay taxes number almost 21 million and each of them would have to pay a minimum of almost 13500 in taxes to pay for our governments spending.

If you ask me something is terribly wrong.  If there aren't enough jobs to pay 21 million people 51000 a year in a population of 61 million this is a statistic that needs to be brought to light.  This is not even counting any corporate tax at all.  We would only need 21 million people making a minimum of 50 thousand a year to pay for our 280 billion pound expenditures.

So we know from this that something is very wrong, very wrong indeed.  If businesses paid no tax at all but raised incomes, we wouldn't have a deficit in my opinion.  

If David Cameron wants to talk only about money in and results then he should be thinking in these terms.  If we have expenditures of 280 billion you have to have a minimum of 21 million jobs that raise that tax revenue.

true,Variola13,null,null,"The scheme in my local area is run by [Orbit](http://www.orbit.org.uk/main.cfm), in fact my neighbour 3 doors down bought half her property through Orbit and pays the council rent on the other half. From her experience I gather it has been positive and a good way of being able to afford a home that you would not otherwise be able to afford. 

In principal I am in favour of it, because it is a great move for first time buyers, I am not sure how amenable mortgage companies are to it? I assume it would be like any other mortgage as it is still part of a property that retains its value.  However at the present time, more investment is needed in social housing, it is a long term plan though that will not make a dramatic difference for several years, but I belief it is an essential basis to tackle the situation we are in as a country. 

&gt;If councils invested into public shared-equity properties, and if housing benefits instead of being 'lost money' counted towards a deposit and mortgage payments, even if it was only 10% of a property share would you be inclined? Arguably somebody that is mid term term tenant could save up a deposit. If the property is worth £150k on sale they only get £15k but that would be £15k for them to spend; be it into a business, a deposit, pension, whatever.

I am pondering on that one, forgive me if I am being dim I just need to clarify. So a person ( employed) owns a percentage of a property, which they pay a mortgage on. The rest of the property would be owned by the council and they have to pay rent to the council on it. 
At the moment, I am not sure if they would be entitled to HB on a shared property, but assuming they were, they HB would be counted as a deposit on the other percentage of property that they do not own? In which case what would be in it for the council? 
I suspect I am talking myself into confusion here but if you could clarify that would be great :-) 

&gt;Shared-equity programmes is one of the few things New Labour introduced that I can get behind, but I feel it might have greater potential to address both lack of housing and council housing. A clash of private and public sector actually working for the common good for a change. It's an idea that I've been wrestling with. 

Yup, Tax credits was a great idea but like most poorly managed govt schemes it has turned out to be a nightmare. I hear a lot about how private companies are incompetent [forensic science is a recent example](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/privatisation-is-a-catastrophe-warns-godfather-of-forensics-7606789.html) but tax credits is a shining turd of incompetence, over payments, underpayments, clawing back money paid by their error, mismanagements, clients not being able to get through on phone lines for weeks, the list is endless. I am still fully behind the principle of support the lower paid, so they can work, but not when their income is 35K, while is it not 'rich' is is by no means low paid. If anything I am more in favour of tax breaks for those being paid at that 'intermediate' level. 

I maybe missing a few key points. science is more my thing rather than economics, so do feel free to correct me or clarify.

- Too many of the stories are tied into a plot arc in the Smith era. 

I can go into seasons 1-4, pick out a disk and watch an episode.

I can go into seasons 5-6, pick out a disk and then remember I should really watch X-Y-Z from earlier in the series/the previous series. This puts me off rewatching them. 

- I no longer connect with the companions. Karen Gillan is probably a very good actress, but something about her doesn't rub well with me. It's like when you see a nervous person go up on stage in front of the school, even though you know they're doing their best there is always that slight bit of hesitation which somehow ruins the dramatic impact of whatever she is acting out, it just shows the audience (to me at least) that it's not a spontaneous sentence, she's thinking of what she read in a script earlier. 

tl;dr I haven't felt overly joyful or sad after any of KG's performances. 

I just feel like I felt more emotionally connected with the characters during the 9/10 era, it feels much more like I'm watching actors in 5/6 (Bar The Eleventh Hour, which is still my favourite MS episode).

true,GrowleyTheBear,eng-staffordshire,Staffordshire,"This is actually what i'm hoping to get into after Uni, so i've been reading quite a bit on the subject; In short, it's really hard to estimate. People have been making these estimates for decades and they've never come true, usually because the goalposts move. 

A bit of reactor physics before i start. We define the Energy output divided by the energy input to be the Q value. A Q value of 1 is deemed to be ""break even"" where we get out just as much as we get in, the world record is currently 0.7, set by the JET facility in Oxfordshire (Believe it or not the UK is pretty boss at this kind of thing). For the plasma to sustain itself without external heating you have to hit a Q of ~5 that is 5 times as much energy produced as consumed and for a commercial plant you really want to be hitting at least 10.


Right, so the current record is JET at Q = ~0.7. It's retiring soon, but before it does they're basically going to run it into the ground by pumping it full of a more energetic fuel and try and hit Q = 1. So it could well be in 2014 that we get more energy out than in. 

If that doesn't happen though, it will definitely be hit by ITER, which is aiming for Q = 10. ITER is basically the last step before we start building MCF power stations all over the place and first plasma is expected in 2019, meaning we could have Fusion power in the grid by 2033. This is pretty much the longest estimate though in my eyes.

There are a lot of small start-ups investigating Fusion Energy commercially - primarily because the payoff will be so huge. They're a little more secretive than the big govt. projects for obvious reasons, but groups like [Plasma Focus Fusion](http://focusfusion.org/) might get us there a lot sooner than MCF, i.e. a Commercialisable plant in the next 10 years.

There's also Inertial Laser confinement fusion which is chugging along nicely, with the National Ignition Facility at the moment and the High power laser energy research facility planned in Europe, it's moving a lot faster than Magnetic Confinement did, but with the huge facilities it's unlikely we'll see anything concrete before 2040.",0,1333718121,null,0,false,0,c495epm,t3_ruf58,t1_c495epm,t1_c494nsp,null,1428667113,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

""Yes, it must have been a fix when Barca didn't get a penalty and Ballack wasn't sent off in the first leg against Chelsea in 2009. It must have been a fix when Puyol was sent off and a penalty was awarded after he collided with Fabregas in 2010. It must have been a fix when Milito's offisde goal was given a year later and Sneijder's penalty on Alves wasn't given. It must have been a fix that same year when Bojan's 94th-minute 'winner' was disallowed for a handball that no amount a replays can show to be clear. It must have been a fix when Messi had an onside goal that would have made it 0-2 was disallowed at the Emirates in 2011. It must have been a fix when Barca had two cast iron penalties not given at the San Siro last week. It was a fix - how couldn't it be? - when the referee blew two correct penalties this week against Milan. And, of course, it must have been a fix when Barca drew Lyon, Bayern and Inter in the knockout stages in 2009; Stuttgart, Arsenal and Inter in 2010; Arsenal, Shakhtar and Madrid in 2011; and Bayer; Milan and Chelsea this season. Such easy draws, purleese. And beating Man Utd in 2009 with half their defence suspended or Wembley? How's that a challenge?

But, of course, it was no fix when when Porto beat Man Utd thanks to an incorrectly disallowed Paul Scholes goal. It was no fix when Chelsea beat Rijkaard's Barca thanks to a goal facilitated by a foul on Valdes. It was no fix when Inter got out of the group stage against Dynamo Kiev with an injury-time offside goal. It was no fix when Inter beat Chelsea thanks to a penalty that wasn't blown at the San Siro. It was no fix when Inter beat Barca thanks to the aforementioned incidents. No, when talking about Barca, there is a narrative: they get all the calls, they're cheating, diving bastards, UEFA want them to win and put no obstacles in their way, all Barca wins are controversial and tainted by questionable decisions that, of course, only ever go their way. Yes, Barca have gotten many decisions over these past four seasons; they've also had quite a few go against them. But the begrudgers prefer to clog up below the line with a never-ending stream of conspiracy theories - some of which at times veer into xenophobic rants. But because it's Barca, a team recognised by many as playing a revolutionary style a football that has dominated Spain and Europe, and provided the backbone to the previously inept Spanish national team that came out of nowhere (group stage at Euro 2008 and second round at 2006 WC) to win the Euros and World Cup it's all down to luck and a black hand. People who profess to 'love the beautiful game' suddenly say that demanding a yellow card after being clattered is 'ruining football'. People who call themselves 'football fans' get pissed off that a team that has sat back an defended, playing on the counter, having 19 attempts on goal over four matches is beaten by one that has made 62 attempts.

There's a general sense that PPHs are monkish / concerned with theology, but it plays almost no role in the social structure of Oxford.

2. As an undergraduate you almost certainly won't be able to choose. But you'll get very good tutors from the university. If your college/PPH doesn't have a tutor for the subject you're doing, the university provides. 

3. Definitely not. In Oxford you're taught by Oxford University, not your college or PPH. 

4. That's a difficult one. I find that one mostly builds friendship groups with people in the same college. But that's almost certainly contingent on the fact that colleges offer a large population with a wide range of people from different subjects. If Blackfriars don't offer that, then expect to find it elsewhere. There are *loads* of societies in Oxford, catering for pretty much every interest. **Make sure you go to the fresher's fair to see what's on offer**. You'll make friends with the people doing your subject when you meet them in tutorials/lectures/classes, etc. If you get involved with university-wide sports you'll make friends. The list goes on. Don't despair about the social situation: PPHs aren't ideal, but if you make the extra effort you're not at any disadvantage!

II'll be in Oxford again this Michaelmas (studying the BPhil Masters). If you ever need someone to talk to about anything, things aren't going well, or you fancy a drink, just PM me :)

1) A lot of people just won't know anything about it, I reckon most will have heard the name, some might think it's a bit monkish (which is kinda fair because it does have monks) but basically it'll just be a conversation starter. People will form impressions of you based on your personality not your college. Unless they're twats, but then who cares.

2) Your college probably has an arrangement with some other college whereby you'll generally get core economics tutes at that college (for us it's Oriel). For later options if you continue economics to finals tutors will just be assigned by the department in the same way they are for everyone else (there are loads of economics modules and most will only have two or three tutors in the whole uni that teach them).

3) No. Your degree is from Oxford not from your college. Your college will not be stated anywhere on your degree certificates. You get the same lectures, same exams as everyone else.

4) If you're worried Blackfiars is too small a circle of people just join clubs and societies. It's easy to build up a good network of people throughout the university and not just in your college. Just aim to be very sociable, particularly in the first year. I recommend student journalism in particular, great socials and stuff.

Public attempts at demonisation?    

Removal of rights - Well with regards to businesses, there are plenty of restrictions in place over the selling/stocking of various items. So much so that I won't even begin to detail them! It's hardly oppressive.
    
But removal of individual rights: Where has that taken place? The only thing I can think of is banning smoking indoors in places like pubs or restaurants. However in that case it was a case of weighing up the rights of a group to 'inflict' their habits on others, I thought, though it could be that the government went via the 'bar staff health' route. Again, they're not being stopped from smoking entirely.

I'm still not convinced on the ""persecution"" front, though that could change if the demonisation has taken place in some way. I think it might be subjective.

edit - If my thinking is wrong and you can demonstrate, then say - I'm not a fan of being wrong when I don't have to be. Downvoting tells us nothing.

It would just be a way of saying ""look we're doing something shocking!"" and making changes for no good reason other than to grab people's attention.

But does anyone know what you would do once everyone's staring? How do you work with these new dynamics? How does the Doctor feel about his/her love for Rose? For River? How does the father whose lost his family translate? Do you change it to mother? Do you have him/her act more feminine? Do you write him/her with a woman in mind, or a man?

These are all of the issues brought up by a change that is being made for no real reason other than ""we haven't done it before"".

It would be like fixing the TARDIS's time circuits or making the Doctor American. It's just not the flavor of the show, it's something completely and pointlessly different just for the sake of causing scandal.

Seriously, does anyone have any real reason to make the Doctor a woman other than ""it would be fun"" or the vague ""it would open up so many new possibilities""?

I really like the idea of Doctor Who being a little more personal and a little more emotional, but no one wants them to lay it on too thick. I enjoyed this episode, but it's kind of ruined for me. I can't really fdully enjoy it like all of you.

You see, I did extensive studies in Van Gogh's life, so every inconsistency the episode has I cringe. He *didn't* commit suicide. He *didn't* live in abject poverty during this time of his life. Just so many things about what paintings he had finished when and how he was living when he made them really irks me, and I know that's just me.

I suppose I'd feel the same way about Girl in the Fireplace if I had studied Madame de Pompadour.

I don't think he's a very good writer, but he has some interesting ideas and tries his best to piece them together. Except when in the RTD era where he had lots of time to flesh out his ideas, he's got to crank them out really fast now and the gaps in the plot seem so much more evident.

Even the most popular episodes like a good man goes to war, are incredibly lacking in depth. They are however chalk full of interesting characters you want to know more about but never will. The whole reveal in that episode felt so abrupt and forced that I didn't even really enjoy the episode. 

Dr. Who is more akin to a show like LOST these days. It leaves a lot of empty gaps in the plot so you can fill in your own. Often those theories can be wild and imaginative and thinking about them gets you really excited. When the plot is finally laid out in all its glory, often it doesn't add up to your theories.

However, I wouldn't leap to any conclusions, or presume to guess the motivations of those who decided to make that change, before I saw the show for myself.

By and large, I find that the ""woman in authority"" figure is often poorly handled on TV.  And on a purely personal level, I prefer watching male actors as I tend to identify with them more (even though I'm a woman, go figure...).  But I'm willing to keep an open mind.

After all, it's not like Eleven is the most convincingly masculine figure out there anyway.  He tends towards androgynous much of the time, imo.

With Nine and Ten, especially because they were bridged by Rose, Jackie, Mickey, and Captain Jack, it felt much more natural.  With Eleven, as flutter noted, it feels like New New Who, a completely separate character.

Part of this, though, might be my personal inability to take Matt Smith seriously.  Paul McGann, Eccleston, and Tennant all had a remarkable ability to shift into ""serious mode"" with a suddenness and intensity that made them truly menacing.  You could FEEL all those centuries of wisdom, power, pain and loss almost emanating from them.  When Tennant was angry, you felt the fury of a time lord.  When Smith tries to be menacing, I feel like I'm being threatened by a six year old girl.  It really puts me off his performance, despite the fact that he's by no means a bad actor or even a bad Doctor.

Every female character he has gravitates to a stereotype of a sexy flirtatious women that can kick ass. It's consumed River's once deep and mysterious character from Silence in the Library, and Amy quickly became that as well.

So that's really my biggest aversion to the whole idea on top of what you said. The Doctor's not really ""male"" persay.

With EVERY new Doctor comes the allegation that the show is being ""dumbed down"" for ________ (Americans, kids, etc).  I remember: Davison -&gt; Baker (WTF is he, a CLOWN?)  Baker -&gt; McCoy (Oh, here's the Chaplin clone!) McCoy -&gt; McGann (Psh, American TV Doctor) ...  And so on.

Basically, what I've always taken away form it over the last 30 years or so is that the show changes.  Sometimes the change meshed with people, and sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes, it changes AWAY from established fans to a whole NEW set of people who never would have given it a second glance before.  It's a fluid show unlike just about any other.

I'm not saying anyone's wrong to dislike the opening or Smith.  Go for it.  But, don't get too hung up on it.  Just saying to keep some perspective.  Don't start thinking the sky is falling because its changing to try something new or different.  It's not the end of the world.  The show has weathered this type of debate for longer than most of us have been ALIVE.

Yes, but none of those things pay off in a comprehensive way. I mean, Big Bang was a *mess*. Why would the Daleks team up with the Sycorax? What do they even have to gain by bringing the farting Slitheen or the mindless Hoix in on the Doctor-capturing game? Why would they capture him instead of killing him, even though every last one of them present were armed while the Doctor was not? And *why the hell* did they use the memories from Amy's house to make an army of Autons? That makes *no goddamn sense*.

And then you have the whole River debacle. You've got the contrived ""boinking the the TARDIS = Time Lord baby"" and the even more contrived ""been-her-the-whole-time-trust-us"" Mel appearing out of nowhere, so obviously being Melody Pond. It just reeks of last-minute improvisation and a lack of proper planning.

And the previous seasons did have themes. Bad Wolf was ever-present, engaging, intriguing, but not something that ate up screentime or dampened other stories. Ditto for ""Vote Saxton"" or the disappearing bees. The cracks not only were portrayed inconsistently (are they portals that connect two points in space and time, like in the Eleventh Hour, or are they magic erasers of the cosmos?) and we still have no idea how the TARDIS blew up or why.

Anyway, I hate the argument that making a character female automatically makes gender the central issue.  For the longest time ""male"" meant human, while ""female"" meant just ""not male"".  That's why most of the animal/non-human characters in children's books were all male, except when they were definitely mothers (like Kanga).  Because the thinking at the time was that any child could identify with a male character, but only girls would enjoy female characters.  So I'd definitely support a female doctor, if it could mean helping us all move past the idea of ""female is always other"".  And I think an older actress with gravitas and authority, such as Helen Mirren, could probably pull it off.

Would I want it left in Moffat's hands?  While I don't have the issues others have with his handling of women, I don't think he's the director to do it.  But so what?  Doctor Who's had many different directors.  New director, new Doctor, allons-y!

Obviously there was consistancy within the secluded RTD Who just like there is in Moffat Who but the call backs to things outside of that are limited.

The things that keep the show consistent are the iconic things.  The Daleks, the cybermen, the TARDIS.  Companions and Doctors, while loved, come and go while other things remain consistent.

""a team which looks, at best, disjointed""

At it's best this season the team has been *very* good. The defence, up until a couple of months ago, was the best in the league, and against the big teams we have played extremely well for the most part. Suarez looks like one of the best players in the world at unlocking a defence, Carroll stepped up during Suarez's suspension and performed well. Downing has had a few matches recently where he's looked back to decent form. The much derided Charlie Adam looked like a clever buy earlier on in the season. Gerrard, back from injury, looked utterly imperious against Everton.

Which makes it all the more frustrating that we are so damned inconsistent. I just can't help but feel that there's a really promising team in there somewhere. They just all need to play to the levels they are capable of together, consistently.

Is it that we're too dependant on certain players defensively, like Agger, Lucas and maybe Johnson? I can see Coates overtaking Carra in the central defensive pecking order (if he hasn't already done so). Maybe we need another more experienced back up there?

Do we need another striker, to partner Suarez and allow Carroll to develop away from the spotlight a little more?

Maybe we've chopped and changed our line up too much, instead of sticking with a regular starting 11 and formation.

And although I would have liked more of his past cropping up, it's been subdued and I think that's effective. The Doctor's never much been about his past so much as the next big adventure. If he really is indeed running from something I can't imagine him looking back too often especially when you factor in the Time War.

But it's not like they pretended that the Classic Series never existed. We get to see Daleks again, as well as Cybermen (even the head of a classic Cyberman). We see Sarah Jane again (something even Classic Who hadn't done for years) and K-9. Companions returning for something that's not a reunion special. Something only New Who had really done (although I'm well aware of Seven's Battlefield and the like, it is still an unusual occurrance).

Although it's funny you ask. There was a rather talented actor up for the role of Eleven named [Paterson Joseph](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430667/). Seeing as the Doctor is an alien and the only real ties to ethnicity that would become important is culture (something the Doctor obviously wouldn't be influenced by) I really don't see much of a problem (so long as the BBC isn't just casting a black actor as a stunt, then it's not cool).

A change of race makes about as much difference as a change in hair color, whereas a change in gender (something the Doctor's never really been super affiliated with, mind you) will bring up some questions that really just create unwarranted drama for drama's sake. Actually, they made the Doctor a woman in ""The Curse of the Fatal Death"" and I fear that's exactly what will happen with Doctor Who.

I mean, he's *married* (sort of). How is that relationship going to work out now, particularly with all of the clear flirting between the two of them? That's just either going to be horribly awkward or unintentionally hilarious. Either way, not really a good move overall.

I *would* object to the Doctor being American, though. He's just so quintessentially British that changing him to be anything else kind of betrays the whole character, and I feel similarly to the gender.

They mentioned the Brigadier in The Wedding of River Song.  Moffat clearly doesn't pretend like it didn't exist.  He has tons of call backs to them so it seems like your defeating your own argument there if small callbacks are all that is needed for consistency as implied by your talks of ""the Shadow Proclamation"".  Not to mention Torchwood and the Shadow Proclamation were only in RTD Who.  Why would they be mentioned now?  They don't matter, their stories are done or have now diverged.

I guess I don't feel like the world is inconsistent or that it lacks callbacks.  I see plenty of them; references to old Doctor's lines, old characters (in LKH and TWoRS), and obviously the Monsters.

I think you're not understanding my point. It's not the recurring characters or the references, it's the cohesion of the *feel*. You can create a different flavor, one that's wildly different from the other, but there has to be that sort of familiarity. To let you know that you're tasting the same brand, just in a new taste.

That's what I'm talking about. I'm not saying ""never forget about the past and carry it with you all the time"", because that's contrary to what Doctor Who is. Instead I posit that certain nods be made. Nods so subtle that they could hardly be called nods, just a subtle intermingling of the past and the present, one seamlessly leading into the other. That's all I request.

I don't really know what you mean by ""old characters"". In fact, in A Good Man Goes To War, it's a bit disappointing that he didn't call in a few of his friends that he *actually* met and has debts against. Maybe just one or two people from RTD's run instead of concocting new people and bringing back the pirates from that insufferable Black Spot episode.

That's the sort of thing I'm talking about.

Mel, admittedly was contrived, but I found her an amusing addition due to the recursive nature of her name.

Regarding the cracks, you're assuming they can only do one or the other, it's never said explicitly so the appropriate assumption is that they can exhibit both behaviours.

The TARDIS blowing up does need explaining and I sympathise entirely with you here, but hopefully it will be explained in Series 7, otherwise we might have to make do with fan speculation.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"It's not a same-sex relationship, it's a ""one partner dies and without intention turns into a lady"" relationship. Neither of them asked for this, and figuring that the Doctor's had children and a wife before, I'm not too sure about how he'd feel about it either. In even the slightest of wrong hands the whole thing turns into a farce.

The Doctor's always been male just like he's always been British. HE's never been *excessively* male just like he's never been *excessively* British. He's just been British every single time and has been male equally so. It's become a facet of who he is.

For example: I have no issue with the Avatar being female. I have no issue with this because it's a title not a personage, and it's one that's changed genders many, many times. But the Doctor's a person. One that's been very much male (though not too very much masculine) his entire life. A sudden change no seems to serve no real purpose other than ""let's change it to make a kerfuffle!"".

River would care. It would seem Amy might care. I know she seems to have mostly gotten over her little attempted-affair with him, but she still refers to him and Rory as ""her boys"" and she is River's mother, after all.

We can forget his gender when it's a given. If the Doctor was always female and then suddenly became a man it would be equally pointless and equally jarring. It's taking a character that's never been about gender and then drawing attention to the fact that it's changed.

In fact, if the Doctor was particularly masculine, I could see the merit in a gender change, as that would at least give a new angle and perspective. But the Doctor's not like that. Gender (for him) has never been an issue, and now it suddenly is brought to the forefront for nothing other than shits and giggles.

I still have no idea why a Dalek (who we've already seen never makes alliances) would team up with species as stupid as the Sycorax or the Hoix, let alone the question of how a Silurian got there when they should be hibernating underground at this point in time. I mean, most of the Pandorica Alliance seemed to have no real role other than be there for the granite photoshoot after they lock the Doctor away. What were they providing? Moral support?

And it's even more unbelievable to show a Dalek *not killing*. Not killing, when it literally has every motive and ability to just shoot the Doctor. Seriously, half of the people there have no reason not to kill the Doctor, and yet they encase him in perfect protection from the end of the universe (the thing they were trying to protect *themselves from*, work that one out).

And the littler things like why would Daleks, who ""have no concept of elegance"" decide to color code themselves in pastels?

And yes, you're right about a Huntelaar type finisher. I think most folks agree with that. It's been a fairly obvious shortcoming all season.

A good quality defensive midfielder as back up for Lucas would be a possibility. They would need to be a marked improvement in Spearing.

All of those examples you gave were weaknesses in their characters, moments of relapse into the absurd (except for K-9, but during this time everybody had a robot pet). These weren't *who they were*, but rather temporary things they did.

How would you feel if Han Solo was a lizard-man? Or if River was a man? Or if Martha had been a Raxacoracapallapatorian? Or if Rassilon was a woman, or if the TARDIS took the form of a man or any other host of pointless changes made that only serve for change's sake and not to strengthen the character itself.

The point is that in Doctor Who, with the Doctor, gender isn't important. His gender has come up once or twice (and I really do mention his children in this), but on the whole he's not been called ""Mister"", he's just ""the Doctor.

If you change the gender, suddenly you've drawn attention to a needless aspect of the story, something that's never been brought up because it's a detriment to the story. Now we have to have episodes of the Doctor explaining his femininity and pontificating on how he's (and I don't know if this phrase has even been used more accurately than now) not the man he used to be.

Doctor Who's relapsed into camp and silliness, but that's never been it's defining characteristic, and it's something New Who's been recovering from. To go ""let's put tits on the Doctor"" with no real course of action or meaningful reason behind it makes no sense.

And beyond this the BBC would *never* go for it.

Doctor Who'd viewership's been fluctuating erradically past where it's budget needs it to be. The distinctly more feminine (or rather, and attempt at the feminine) Christmas Special was a bomb and they've had to order shorter series.

Although, I do think anyone who believes being female requires the character to stop and go on and on about it, instead of just moving forward with the plot, would be the wrong person to write or direct the series.  Me, I think the stories would be almost exactly the same, with monster of the week, and companions, and lots of running.

I think Han Solo could easily be played by a lizard-man.  After all, why can't a lizard-man be an intergalactic rogue?  No reason River can't be a man, either, as men can be sexy flirts and adventurers, too.  If Martha had been introduced to the show as an alien... so what?  She'd just be an alien companion.  If she'd changed part way through, then we'd have an interesting body/mind swap sci-fi story.  Rassilon can certainly be a (scary) woman, and the TARDIS *did* take on the form of a woman.  So why on earth can't it inhabit a male body just as easily?  It's a pandimensional being!  

And the Doctor's gender is clearly very important, or we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we?  Though I agree with you that the BBC would probably never go for it.

I´ve just been rewatching season 6 of DW and the end of ""The wedding of River Song"" got me thinking.
Why is Dorium so seemingly concerned about the event on the Fields of Trenzalore? It seems if I recall his quoting correctly that the Silence must fall when the question is asked on the fields of Trensalore when nobody can speak falsely or fail to answer. This story will unfold in 2013 at the 50th anniversary for Doctor Who, and it seems to be quite a big story from the hushed hints and speakings from Moffatt. I don´t know why I got it into my head like this If the Silence is determined that the Question will never be answered they must stop the Doctor completely like they tried on lake Silencio. The way Dorium talked about the fall of the eleventh it got me thinking that they might, but I certainly hope not, but they might Kill the Doctor and end the series at that episode/movie event. It would be horrible and I hope they don´t but they might. Because if the Doctor just regenerates to his 12th incarnation the question can still be asked and the silence will fall regardless.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; You're accusing me of calling children leeches

No, I didn't say that exactly, nor mean it. I was re-quoting the article and pointing out what you'd said was, in my opinion, incorrect. I'll do it again but clearer:

&gt; ""Many hungry children are from immigrant families whose parents are not eligible to work or claim benefits.""
&gt;  ...You cannot take our benefits or our goods for free just by coming here. ...Why we can't just put them on a fucking inflatable life raft [it] would be the cheapest way for these leeches on our society to get out.

My point remains: If the kids aren't eating properly because their families can't feed them, and those same families aren't eligible for state support... then the families can't be leeching: They're not claiming benefits. Unless you meant that going to charity is leeching, or that ""They're getting money out of us some other way"". If it's the former then I can't say anything other than ""charity"". If it's the latter then all I can do is shrug.

So far as I can tell you're making certain points that can't be drawn from this particular story. And that says nothing against their validity, btw.

(hell, I even got a little misty-eyed at the end of ""The Girl in the Fireplace,"" which come to think of it, has a very similar core theme.)  

But I think a lot of that has to do with plotting and structure as well.  Even TGWW seemed forced.  Why wouldn't Rory have thought to tell Amy *which* button to push?  He froze for a few beats trying to decide himself, so it's not like he would have forgotten that 2 minutes later.  Hell, fundamentally the whole situation was *his* fault, not the Doctor's. 

The really irritating thing is, I feel like if someone had let me have a pass at the TGWW script, I could have made it better.  I think one thing it needed was an actual demonstration of how bad it would be to let the ""helper"" robots get ahold of you.  All we ever get is the Doctor *saying* it's bad, and A)The Doctor Lies, and B)that breaks the fundamental TV rule of ""show, don't tell.""

Also, I'd have had some sort of temporal distortion going on to further sell the idea that bringing [spoiler](/s ""old bitter Amy"") back to the TARDIS was a really bad idea.  Again, we're only TOLD by the Doctor that it's bad.  I'm imagining some Matrix-style glitches with the same robot walking by twice, or Amy finding herself running in reverse for a couple seconds before time resumed its usual flow.  And have these get more extreme the closer to the TARDIS they get.

Besides escalating the threat, it would make [spoiler](/s ""the Doctor's betrayal"") have more impact as well, since we're used to the Doctor being able to sort out these sorts of timey-wimey problems with some reverse polarity bullshit.  Especially if they made it more clear that [spoiler](/s ""old Amy really had honestly come to believe in the Doctor once again, instead of just petulantly coming along because she doesn't really have anything better to do, and screwing over her young self was just too nasty even for her."")

true,[deleted],null,null,"So the tl;dr of this is essentially a transparent system of power based on what the people want. Sort of like Reddit, then? The good stuff rises to the top - because the users vote for what they like - and the shit sinks to the bottom. Sounds like a perfect system, one which most people could agree with. But it doesn't really work - not even on Reddit or Digg or Metafilter or any social news website, because look at your front page. There's posts about people who've turned to the website to find support after being raped or something with about seven upvotes and two comments, and then a picture of a jogger in a purple shirt with some text over it that gets about a billion votes and 4000 comments in twenty minutes.

The problem with this system is that it's not a proper democracy, it's *populist* democracy which reflects the raw and unrefined will of the people (an appealing but also very dangerous thing). Take the MMR jab scare; I could write an article about MMR jabs causing autism and then immediately there'd be panic. Everyone would ""upvote"" a law to ban the MMR jab on impulse and it'd be complicated and expensive to reverse that ban after I admit that my article was wrong. Everyone would attack me for making a mistake and they'd make me fuck a pig on television. How would that be fair?

Such a system would be just as easily to corrupt as the current one. Instead of paying parties to pass policies that favour the elite, we'd be giving them a far more effective and cheap system in which the elite can just do some good old fashioned scare mongering to get us to vote for whatever policy they suggest that'll make all the scary things go away. There'd be nobody to stop it because there's no accountability in a system like that.

I'm not saying it's a *bad* idea, but I will say that most of the things you mention can already achieved with the MPs that you currently have. You just have to write to them. You know, the old fashioned way; you write a letter, print it off, then send it to them. Two, three, ten, twenty, a hundred times until they listen to you. Go to their local offices in which you can speak to them face to face and tell them how you feel. By simply pestering your MP and letting them know they'll lose your vote if they don't listen. The only problem is that the majority of people can't be arsed with that because it's really hard :'( and want a lazy way of doing it online.

Something like the Digital Economy Bill, how many people do you know went and hounded their MP until they agreed not to vote for it rather than just using a link from 38 Degrees? I sent letters to my MP every few days and eventually got a positive reply after a month, even though the bill still passed. Granted, that's not really a good example. You can say the same thing about the tuition fees hike - everyone objected but they still passed it. The point is that the system we have - theoretically - is completely fine. The problem is corruption and that can't be solved with an upvote/downvote button, as much as everyone wants it to be.

I realize my reply sounds very hostile, but I mean no offense - I'm just playing devil's advocate :)",0,1333787811,null,0,false,0,c49gptq,t3_rr7qz,t1_c49gptq,t3_rr7qz,null,1428672587,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then compromise at the end. Some of it goes back, but some things actually change. Members of the altered timeline travel with the Doctor, anachronisms from an Earth that never was. At least one of them becomes a Companion, another relic of lost Time, traveling with the Doctor.

My personal suggestion is that they do it by screwing around with the Phantom Time Hypothesis, a conspiracy theory that 300 years of the Middle Ages never happened. It includes the life of Charlemagne. I could genuinely get behind the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne being the Doctor's Companion, helping to put Time right.

As a result, it turns out that a large portion (or a small and loud portion) of the group didn't want that mod, and have spoken. (I refer to people who spoke publicly that they did not agree with the choosing process, not the cowards sending abusive messages).

I didn't say pickledinevil asked for this, and she doesn't deserve the abuse she got. But this sub spoke it's opinion, and it was ignored. THAT was sad.

People HAVE bitching phases, meets are for when the flames have died down.

184 subs, 3 were mods, 1 wasn't a member when this started. That was 180 people. If I recall, you weren't conferred with either, that was 181 people whose opinion didn't matter when the new mod was chosen.

At this point, having been on a lot of buses in Manchester before I just assumed the woman was crazy and just let it go, but she kept saying this and it started to distress the children on the bus. When passengers started to complain the bus driver stopped the bus and called in his depo which called in the police to the route. 

Anyway, the bus stopped and we all started to get off to stretch legs and stay away from the woman(which again i will say she was there with her boyfriend/husband and her 2 teenage daughters) She remained on the bus. When we all got off she pulled out the thing that would ""end us all"" and it was just a lighter and she started laughing and then set her tracksuit jacket on fire. 

Her family was in hysterics to why should do such a thing, the passengers who got off the bus, me included, managed to rush onto the bus and put out her jacket before it got too big and took the lighter and the jacket away leaving the woman crying on the bus.

When we got off the bus she pulled out a second lighter which she had in her pants to which she had doctor'd to make the flame go bigger(its really easy to do), lit the lighter and then huddled over it moving it around in front of her face making the flame touch her face and move all around it. We rushed onto the bus and pulled her away from the lighter took the second lighter and as we did that the police turned up and took her into custody.

I believe there is a similar effect in suicidal spree killers that run amok. Probably something deep routed in human psychology.

Of course it creates a dilemma for a free press. Censorship to prevent social contagion or suppression that hides genuine social turmoil?

I have no idea if this story was suppressed or not. But I suspect that news do not report on every suicide attempt as its all too common rather than some agenda benign or otherwise.

I agree, the doctors and nurses are definitely skilled and use their skills (which are definitely of value) well in helping other people, but in situations like my example, praying for someone's well being, it may be that something were to go wrong, the doctors and nurses get their just in time, or use their skill at just the right time in this case, e.g. they go to inject adrenaline when someone is in cardiac arrest, sure, I agree that this would've been done with no intervention of a higher being (will have already had to go get the adrenaline and inject it), but God may ""make"" them inject the person within the right timeframe, in order to ensure survival through what the rest of the staff may do, whether it's CPR, use of a defibrillator, whatever.

Edit: An example I've read throughout my A level. A mother's son is playing on the railway near their house. The mother comes out and tell the boy to get off, but his bicycle is stuck; a train is heard to be coming round the corner. This woman prays to God, begging Him to save her son. It just so happens that the guy faints, or has a heart attack; something causing him to stop pressing the accelerator and for the train to slow down a metre or two away from the boy.

Whilst other people may not see that God helped as the driver may have been a heavy smoker, ate nothing but junk food; the woman will feel as though He answered her prayer as what happened saved her son.

true,iusuallypostwhileipo,uk,Where's the Texas flag?,"Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

The only information I was asking about was wether it was good/bad that the bill was postponed and what happens to postponed bills.

Nobody knows what's going to be changed in the bill, and I wasn't asking for opinions on the matter. 

Many of the opinions I got were just totally wrong, someone said something along the lines of the new bill won't just legalize banned breeds. Well, that's exactly what the bill will do. 

I don't see how that can be negotiated on, the bill is a bit like an on/off switch for the banned breeds. Either they will be legal if the bill passes or they won't if it doesn't. That's not to say that compromise can't be made on the bill, but to compromise on wether the dogs will be legalized in a bill about wether to legalize the dogs seems a little ridiculous to me. That's the reason the bill exists, why compromise on the main point. Most of the compromises in the law making system here in the states centers around the secondary issues in a bill. Not the main issue and I'm sure it's the same there.   

I don't agree with the reasoning behind the current law, especially when it has been proven time and time again to not stop criminals from having these types of dogs but I do respect it.

But again. None of this really matters because all I was asking for is what happens next to a bill that wasn't read during it's scheduled time.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"I would disagree. I couldn't spare the time to go to the game today, but ordinarily I'm at most matches home, away and in Europe. Frankly, the average fan shells out thousands of Pounds a season to watch matches and expect better than that. Lack of passion and drive was the hallmark of the AVB tenure and the crowd turning on him was one of the final nails in the coffin

People boo Sturridge because he wastes golden opportunities by either running into a defender, blasting the ball in to Earls Court or not looking up in general. This kind of waste gets us in to trouble, as it did today, as we nearly dropped 2 points. Every player has their selfish moments, Didier had one today and immediately apologised to Sturridge, who was open and ready to score. I rarely if ever see Sturridge say sorry for his profligacy

A lot of our lads on the pitch need a dose of tough love. The entitled attitude has led to our position right now, both on the pitch and off it. This is the second time where Torres has come on to the other flank and shown how it should be done, Sturridge learns nothing. With the fixtures coming as they are, fans are putting more time, money and effort in to attending matches than ever, resulting in a pretty short attitude when it comes to idiotic behaviour

As an example, last Wednesday during the Benfica match, the District line was suspended in one direction due to signal failure at Wimbledon. Now, theres only two ways to go from our tube station and if you want to get on that train within 30 minutes, you better be out of the stadium before the game ends. That night, a lot of people didn't get home until 2/3am, and I know several people who commute in to Central London, parking their car and tube-ing in the rest of the way, who couldn't get home at all because car parks close at 11pm or midnight and they couldn't get back in time

It was a rare incident, but there's so much stuff to go through when you're at the Bridge week in, week out, and I think the spectators have higher expectations than people who watch games on TV/stream

I think that one of our biggest problems today was lack of quality from fullbacks. Obviously our passing was shit and there was a staggering lack of space anywhere on the field, but our fullbacks got into good positions and failed. 

On the contrary, BAE's crossing is actually typically quite remarkable and it's one of our biggest assets in breaking teams down that play like this. But today it was shit. Walker's crossing is always shit, IMO. He is a good outlet and has great positioning, but he really is poor at doing anything with the ball.

It's just hard to put a finger on what the problem was. Not enough confidence in the passing, not good enough movement, etc. Everyone seemed more afraid of losing than hungry to win. ",0,1333816017,null,0,false,0,c49j58c,t3_rxxlv,t1_c49j58c,t1_c49j1wv,null,1428673741,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;I am not sure how amenable mortgage companies are to it? 

Extremely.  They limit it to people of less capital for *public* shared equity, as opposed to private, when it is there to serve to provide affordable housing (I seem to remember a threshold of about £50k) but they even allow it for second homes with the intent to rent out, so when people want to use it as a business venture.  I briefly looked into it but from what I saw the capital I'd have to disclose was too much.  In theory I could buy the 80% share of a split equity property and charge a diminutive rent on the 20% they don't own to make it worth their while but I'd still be charging them more than what council housing would otherwise have provided, but cumulatively that wouldn't be a solution to the housing problem people face.  I'm not approaching this as to what would be an good investment for me but how to solve the housing problem for those on lower incomes - which ultimately I believe solving would make a better society and economic environment for everyone.

As a rule mortgage companies seem to be increasingly favourable.

&gt; I assume it would be like any other mortgage as it is still part of a property that retains its value.

That's the thing that I'm not quick to assume or build a policy on.  People in recent years have been keen to assume property as an investment.  In reality it is a potential liability if it is your own home.  Negative equity does exist.  If the roof leaks, you have to fix it.  You have to maintain the decorations.  You even have to renovate it to keep it in mode and desirable with the market.  Prices can go down, areas can become less desirable.  As a trend properties retain, even make, on their value - but it is not a rule.  People tend to see it as their property and an isolated investment but it's entirely dependent on a much larger system which people aren't in control of.

&gt;I am pondering on that one, forgive me if I am being dim I just need to clarify. 

You're not being dim, I'm being convoluted because I'm simply sounding off ideas (the hangover's remarkably aloof as it goes, I was relatively sensible).

&gt;So a person ( employed) owns a percentage of a property, which they pay a mortgage on. The rest of the property would be owned by the council and they have to pay rent to the council on it. At the moment, I am not sure if they would be entitled to HB on a shared property, but assuming they were, they HB would be counted as a deposit on the other percentage of property that they do not own?

I was actually looking at it another, more radical way.  What if instead of Housing Benefit being something that comes and goes as a temporary measure to keep someone in housing that month that it seen as more of an investment?  Let's say the council buys a property outright.  Where as the housing benefit is given and spent it, instead it is seen more as a holding account for the tenant.  When the HB or the rent, which ever the lesser, over a fixed term, cumulatively comes to a agreed percentage of the original price of the house then they have a choice.  The HB isn't a supplement which is spent on them but don't own, much as like rent is seen as throwing money away, but they actively own the sum of the HB.  It's their money to spend, cash in, reinvest.  However, if they suddenly own 10% of a £150k property once they reach this stage their housing benefit is going to become less, just as housing benefit is assessed now.  They might agree to sell and liquidate their 10% so they can go onto the private property market.  They might agree to continue paying a higher rent.  They might agree to buy the property outright.  

It's not a problem that there was right-to-buy with the crumbling council real-estate, it's that when there was right-to-buy the money it saved and brought in wasn't reinvested in more property!

The approach that I'm working towards is that temporary measures are always much cheaper than permanent solutions but when temporary measures go on indefinitely they nearly always become far more costly overall than if the cash for the permanent solution had just been found in the first place - but that isn't always possible.  We see this already in the NHS and prison service.  Lower income families may go on living hand to mouth indefinitely and ultimately end up costing the state tens of thousands, where if a significant amount of capital where made available to them in one go, regulated, monitored and fund-managed of course, they might well break the cycle.  From the council perspective they'd be financially motivated to constantly be renovating underprivileged area effectively profiting from the public sector whilst providing more affordable housing.

It's a bit like an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.  We need more council housing but we also need to move away from holding onto so much council housing which invariably becomes very costly and a burden of itself for the state, especially when people find it hard to move from council housing to being back in the private market.

Essentially instead of the council supplementing rent, some of it which may go into the private sector and landlords making money because there isn't enough council housing to go around, a percentage of rent and HB going towards a deposit giving them the future option to take it all in one go as a capital injection.  It means moving away from council estates but more council housing with a greater turnaround of public and private housing.  Councils remember can manipulate the local housing market, so they are in a position to still make a profit by investing in run down areas.

&gt;Tax credits was a great idea but like most poorly managed govt schemes it has turned out to be a nightmare...

Which is why I'm really advocating massive tax reform.  What I'm arguing is a stepping stone towards Georgism or Geolibertarianism, where the majority of tax is based from property.  For that to work I need people able to own their own homes, for homes to be affordable, and to help people to break the dependency on benefits cycle (which I can appreciate isn't necessarily their own fault).  There's too much emphasis on the private sector effecting costs of social housing, the should be more emphasis on social provision effecting the cost of affordable housing - and councils with their budgets should be capable of doing this.

&gt;I maybe missing a few key points. science is more my thing rather than economics, so do feel free to correct me or clarify.

In this case I suspect you might have more of a working knowledge than myself because it seems like you've been there before yourself.  You might just say something from experience that I wouldn't know to take into consideration - and geolibertarianism is far from a working economic practice yet, but I like it as an idea for tax reform and to get more away from tax credits, national insurance and income tax.

i)  The centre is not council funded. All core funding comes from donations from the Muslim community. So whilst you are correct that the centre does have a Muslim focus, that is perhaps not a surprise given who is paying for it.
ii) I can assure you that you would be welcome there and would gladly be given a tour (if you aren't, let me know and I will complain on your behalf !) and I am sure that the centre would be keen to have a greater involvement from the wider community. Indeed the centre has held a number of open days in recent years to this end.
iii) Whilst there are some activities that would be frowed upon (as is the case at any centre), it is perhaps looking instead to the common ground, which I suspect represents a much larger spread of possibilities.

The amount of chances we've created are enough to have us sitting pretty in the top 4 but alas, our conversion rate has really let us down.

Very briefly:

Our 'Babe Ruth' player is Dixie Dean who is considered one of the greatest players ever, and was at Everton during the 20s and 30s. 

The last time we were a true force in world football was in the 80s when we had what may well have been the best team in the world. Unfortunately because Liverpool are filthy hooligans we were banned from playing continental football during this era so were never able to test ourselves against the best.

The current Everton team has been built by David Moyes, one of the greatest man managers in football. With little investment he has made us compete with far richer teams. Sadly in his 10 years at the club he has not won any trophies, however we are favourites to beat [very, very](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-03s4NqwYfyU/Tz57V9xcqxI/AAAAAAAAVHo/Ql9Z-IJNf80/s1600/everton-liverpool1.jpg) local rivals Liverpool in the FA Cup semi final. 

Due to an awful start to the season (which is a yearly occurrence for Everton) we found ourselves way too behind to be competitive at the top, however since Xmas we have looked very difficult to beat due to some very good signings filling big creative holes going forward.

We don't play the most exciting, open football and won't be taking home trophies every season; but our fans are loyal, for most people here football is a religion and will stand by the club through anything.

The show is amazing and about the beauty of humanity without all the stupid bullshit that doesn't matter. Since Moffat took over the show, this subreddit has started being about all the bullshit in life that the show tries to ignore. In some instances the stories have been about specifically raising above this exact kind of insignificant superficiality. We've become about memes, idolization, and marketing. Why? 

I've seen people posting stuff they've made and then linking to a site where you can go to buy it. *That is not consistent with the spirit of the show.* At that point it's questionable whether it's really fan art or just merchandise; those types of posts are inspired by money and if you support them, that becomes the purpose of this subreddit. We're also not a community for the sake of being a quirky community. At least we weren't. We were a genuine community of quirky people who enjoyed something that everyone else made fun of/looked down upon. 

Making memes like this cheapens the legacy of the show itself and posting stuff for karma cheapens the subreddit. I don't even know if kids can see the forest because they've grown up between the trees, but surely I'm not alone. Also, OP, this isn't directed at you. I just happened to leave this comment in your meme post instead of one of the others on the doctor who page.

In Northern Ireland, Ireland, the UK, we have a drinking culture. Pubs, bars, clubs are the places to go to on a night out. Whether you're meeting friends, colleagues or new people, that's where you go. And you drink. It's the norm here.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with this at all. Because of this, we have a great nightlife here. People are extremely friendly and fun-loving. But the problem is that all that fun revolves around alcohol. Take that away, and you're suddenly left with nothing to do. Herein lies the cause of the symptoms.

It's very normal here for people to start drinking from an early age. Early teens, maybe earlier. They start experimenting with different drinks. Beer, shots, whiskey, everything. It's something that you start doing with your friends. It's fun. 

The problem is that people don't know when to stop. They've gotten so used to alcohol that they become dependent on it to have fun. So they keep drinking to keep the fun going. Often until they vomit.

My question is, should this really be acceptable? Technically if it's in a home, either your own or someone else's, it's perfectly legal in the UK to start drinking from **5 years old.**

So what if they're sick though? They can all laugh about it the next morning, and about the rest of their drunken antics. But this becomes a cycle. A cycle that's hard to get out of since they started from such an early age. And so they don't do much else. It's as if a night with friends not drinking is a wasted night.

I may be going slightly off topic here but please bear with me. I believe these are the roots of the problem: People don't know when to stop drinking and because this has become the culture here, drastic measures have to be put in place to stop it. It's quicker to start treating the symptoms first while focusing on finding the cause. So yes even though there are countries out there with no final call or official closing times or whatever, doesn't mean that it's a one-size-fits-all matter.

Because we have such a big problem, because so many lives are being lost and alcohol-related crime and general anti-social behaviour aren't decreasing, these measures have to be put in place and tightened. I doubt the Government *wants* to be a nanny state and ruin people's fun. They have to, otherwise the NHS would be screwed.

But they have to treat the causes of the problem. I believe better education, removal of the home legal age and improving leisure facilities with particular focus on teenagers will tackle this, but it's going to take a long time. Once our culture is fixed, once people know when to stop drinking and enjoy a good night out without getting in to any sort of trouble, that's when restrictions like these can be lifted.",0,1333831805,null,0,false,0,c49lpp0,t3_rxuws,t1_c49lpp0,t3_rxuws,null,1428674967,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

To change his gender doesn't really do anything for the character except make everyone suddenly pay attention to the gender and ask ""why?"". It really would just be slapping a pair of tits on a character and calling it progress.

A Time Lord can regenerate, but we've seen nothing that indicates they can become ""any being that exists in the universe"". In fact every single Time Lord we've seen has looked like a human. A small aside with Nine about having two heads or no head does not mean the Doctor could become literally anything.

The Doctor has been traditionally male, but again this isn't a defining characteristic of his. It's just been an aside, something that provided flavor without defining him. If the Doctor turns female that *will define her*. She'll always be known as ""the female Doctor"" because it's such a needless and sudden change. It will make gender the focus rather than the attribute, which is not where it should be in Doctor Who.

I think the evolution of laughter was about signalling threats to have been neutralised or only ever imagined.

We know the banksters are all fat cats, we know condom-headed Cameron is a thinly veiled ideological dicking for wider society, but we have no ability to address the situation. The saying goes that if voting changed anything it would be made illegal, and I would apply the same idea to mockery. It's more entertainment passed off as insight when it isn't misinformation.

Even the prosecution of Murdoch has been reduced to a custard pie to the face. If there was real power available we would go ahead and crush these bastards. It's especially relevant because what is needed is anger and indignation, not amusement. If we go with evolutionary theory once we have ridiculed a phenomena we may feel that there is no longer a threat, and if there is no threat then you let your guard down. We are almost encouraged to be satisfied by this form of 'dissent' (unless it is Thailand of course).

As of a replacement, Taylor Fletcher would be the obvious kind of signing TP would get, but I don't think he would be a massive improvement on what we've got. I would like to think we could steal Spurs previous Top front 2 of Defoe/Crouch, but I couldn't see that happening until Defoe is nearer the end of his career? Rodallega is the other striker that's thrown around every transfer window, but he only seems to really score against us? We were also linked with Lukaka who would suit us to the ground, but he's only 18 and we could only get him on loan from Chelsea, however he was Belgium's top scorer last season so who knows.

I'm not 100% on Jarvis, I think he's good but he didn't impress me that much today, but saying that I wouldn't say no to him for a reasonable price. We definitely need to get some cover for ethers/pennant, but as you said I can't see some of the bigger names wanting to come to us too sit on the bench. I would love to see Kieran Richardson, but he would go to a top 6 club unless we payed a ridiculous fee. Hoilett can play as winger I believe? So I reckon he's a bit of a gamble but could come through. 

Olsson would be a quality signing too, and if Blackburn are relegated I don't see why we shouldn't go for him?

true,boidey,null,null,"I will agree will most of what you wrote.  Alcohol abuse is the norm across the British Isles, emphasising a particular country hides the fact that that affects both the Ireland and the UK.  Here we drink past excess, and it is   the accepted standard. Our inability to drink sensibly causes so much problems and stresses on our society.  

I recently saw it from another viewpoint.  Up to quite recently I had to attend court on an ongoing basis for 2 years approximately.  Whilst there I took to spending some time in district court.  There were so many people who were facing criminal charges due to alcohol misuse/abuse.  I had seen the Saturday night A&amp;E aspect but the viewing how the legal system related to it on a Monday or Tuesday was  new to me.  So here is what saw, our alcohol misuse is gold for the courts.  Here how it works, Judge grants a licence an appropriate individual to sell booze, said person sells booze to someone who fucks up.  The fuck up will initially keep the police busy for a while, who knows, maybe drunk &amp; disorderly, criminal damage, assault or perhaps more serious.  This will require some Police involvement, then a legal aid solicitor, which means a prosecution service counterpart.  There is little fast about the court system, they take their time in doing their work, but they still get paid, and in some ways it is all on the back of the fuckup.  Yes they are culpable for the actions but the amount of times that ""being drunk"" is offered by way of mitigation and explanation is just crazy.  

After a while I began to notice a few scenes being played out again and again.  Quite often a heartbroken Mother or a Sister crying accompanying the lad who was attending court for sentencing.  Their solicitor or barrister will have advised them to expect a custodial sentence so the young fella has a small bag at his feet.    I never engaged any of these folk but I could not but think looking at him;  'You unfortunate sad sorry fuckup have turned up every hearing in your best shell suit, your offered intoxication as explanation of your offence and now your life is going to be changed for ever.  Congratulations kid, you are meat to the machine, pretty soon you will be a regular here""  In messing up their own lives they keep others in work.  A barrister who regularly appeared in those courts described justice at this level to be little more than a rubber stamping  procedure but they all get paid.

I had a theory/hope that maybe, just maybe, the Doctor (either Eleven, Twelve or one beyond.....) would go and eventually meet an eventual descendant of Donna, maybe one who inherited her memories or abilities as the Doctor-Donna.

One can only hope that her legacy will return, after all, her married name translates to the ""Lady Time Lord""

If you change it, you are drawing attention to it. Not just drawing attention to the fact that it's now female, but also to the fact that it was male.

Suddenly you are bringing gender to the foreground. You're taking something that was never a crucial part of Doctor Who (and in reality is just a distraction from the show's core) and throwing it into the forefront for no real reason.

I'm not saying ""the Doctor mustn't ever be a woman"". If the Doctor had been a woman for the past 50 years, I would think that suddenly changing to a man would be just as pointless and obviously a stunt cast.

If it were the case that the Doctor's gender carried no importance, then it would not make any impact to his character or the story if he regenerated as a woman.

If the Doctor regenerated as a woman, she wouldn't necessarily be a token if she wasn't written as such.  The fact that this hasn't happened and probably won't means that the Doctor is not supposed to be gender neutral but a man.  Look, I'm not going to go into detail about the male as default in media because I could rant about it until next January and still not be finished, but we both know the Doctor wouldn't have been a woman because women are very rarely ever given gender ambiguous roles.  Maybe you don't pay attention to the Doctor's gender, but I do.  For me, his maleness is very visible when he belongs to a species that doesn't necessarily have to always be either male or female.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"And I still don't believe you're understanding what I'm saying. The Doctor's gender is something that is mostly ignored. If you change the gender, you've made it impossible to ignore.

This has nothing to do with male being the default. As I have said if the Doctor was female and they were suddenly making her male I would feel similarly, wouldn't you?

I mean honestly, how would you feel if the Doctor had been a woman for 50 years and then turned into a man? Wouldn't it feel a little pointless, a needless change in course? To just suddenly rearrange all of the furniture in your house simply because it's possible to do so? To put the sofa in the dining room simply because it fits there and draws new attention?

This is about a sudden and needless change that is inherently *not* what Doctor Who's about. Doctor Who has had sex-loving characters (let's not even get started on ol' Jack) but it has never been about gender. It had never been about the Doctor's sexuality, so changing the sex of the Doctor is just taking the Doctor and slapping on some breasts.

If, as you say, the Doctor is portrayed exactly as he always is but now as a woman then really, what's the point? So that you have a pair of boobs on the protagonist? So that you can ""appeal to the female demographic""? It's nonsensical, to change a main character's gender after 50 years. It would be jumping the shark.

It would be running out into the streets and shouting ""look at me, I'm doing something *new!*"" just so that more people look at you. It's hollow, it doesn't actually provide any inherent meaning, it's just a change for the sake of being different and not for the sake of feeling like a continuation of a 50 year legacy.

It's not to do with the gender, it's to do with the change of such, and the needless attention it brings. Like Fonzie choosing to jump a shark for no reason, it's doing something ridiculous to grab attention.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"What we were discussing was one character suddenly changing genders after fifty years of remaining the same. A change at this point, regardless of what the starting gender was, would be a pointless change for the simple sake of appearing ""new"" or ""different"". It would be, in definition, the show jumping the shark.

The bit about the furniture I used was what we call an ""analogy"". It is when you describe a similar situation to elucidate a point. This definition can also be found in a dictionary, but note how I'm not condescending and telling you to go read one.

I did indeed stay on-topic. The discussion was on the Doctor changing genders, and I said that the Doctor is a fairly gender neutral character and bringing his gender into the limelight with a sudden change is contrary to his character and to the focus and nature of the show.

I understand that you want the show to make the change to make a statement against the ""male as normative"" mindset of most television (and I can sympathize with you on that regard, I too am no fan of ""white male"" being seen as ""standard""). But this message isn't one that must be made through something as wholly radically pointless as a sudden alteration of gender. You can't just take a major character, slap some breasts and a vagina on them and call that progress.

Like LokainEule said, it's the suddenness and utter unwarranted nature of the change that would make a female Doctor a bad move, but if another Time Lord that had not been shown to have eleven consecutive male regenerations were to change genders then that is a perfectly fine change to make, but with the Doctor it's unnessecary and reeks of a promotional stunt.

And I find it curious that you seem to have unearthed a double standard you have by avoiding the question: would you feel the same if the Doctor had been female and was now becoming male? Let's not escape the question by claiming that television's too narrow-minded to properly portray an independent women whose gender isn't the sole focus and really think about this question, because it's central to the point I'm making.

I have said this before and will reiterate: this has nothing to do with the Doctor becoming female. This has everything to do with the Doctor suddenly changing genders, something he has never done before (and with good cause).",0,1333854330,null,0,false,0,c49pbps,t3_ry424,t1_c49pbps,t1_c49p710,null,1428676729,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

This assumes that men and women are represented equally and are given equal treatment in terms of how they are portrayed, and could thus be compared.  However, this is not the case.  To assert that it is the case, is not only incorrect but diverts from the original point.  It is a red herring because of this and a logical fallacy.  However, I suppose if I don't humor you, you will continue to stay off topic.  If it were the case, all things being equal, that the Doctor was a woman, there should have been several male regenerations.  However, this wouldn't have happened, and women not being portrayed strong and independent has nothing to do with it.  Chalking it up to narrow mindedness also diminishes the complexity of what stories are told and who they are about.  I don't think very many people go around saying, ""I think I'll make my gender neutral character a man because women can never be gender neutral.  Men are people, and women are women"".  It's not some conspiracy against women.  These ideas are deeply embedded in our culture and society, so much so that they aren't often even noticed.  That's why it is wrong and derailing to bring up the what if scenario where the Doctor was always a woman.  You cannot talk about media like they exist in a vacuum.  As I've said, it isn't about making a statement.  It's not about being radical.  It's not about being shocking or ""new"" and ""different"".  It's about making sense.  It's about making a supposedly gender neutral character actually somewhat gender neutral.  It is very strange that a character that regenerates that is supposedly fairly gender neutral has always been one gender, and does call attention to that gender.  I think I've made this point very clear, and I don't know how I could make it any clearer.  Also, just because I was insulting you doesn't mean that my argument was wrong or that I was off topic.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I'd argue that the Doctor is fairly gender-neutral. He does just about as much ""masculine"" actions as he does ""feminine"", however you want to interpret that.

You seem to have a very pessimistic outlook on the world's perception of women, as if the possibility of the Doctor always having been female isn't possible, but a sudden change to it somehow is. I understand that a lot has changed since 1963, but do you really think that a show like Doctor Who couldn't have a female protagonist not defined by their gender? There are actually plenty of science fiction with female leads or female major characters (Buffy, Voyager, Firefly, etc.) that don't have them defined as such.

I really don't think my analogies are irrelevant. At it's core we are discussing change, sudden change that is being made simply because it is possible. That's the real topic at hand, not could the Doctor change genders, but *should* he. And there's no ""logical fallacy"" in likening such a change like that of gender (something that's never been very important to the structure of Doctor Who) to that of changing one's furniture (something that's not important to the structure of the house).

Yes, I fully understand that the media's portrayals permeate to all of society, but the issue at hand is not ""male is normal, female isn't"", it's an issue of *change*. Of a sudden and unwarranted change that really does nothing for the show and attracts attention to an aspect (that of the Doctor's gender) that is unimportant and arguably a detrimental distraction from the actual message and meaning of the show.

Just because the Doctor could change genders (and we aren't even totally certain that he *could*, just because he mentioned the Corsair doing it doesn't mean that he can or more importantly *would*) does not mean that we *must* show him doing so to ""make sense"".

Ultimately doing so (from the standpoint of the BBC) would simply be a stunt. To go ""Hey, we're modern! Look at us shrugging off societal norms! We're relevant!"" is to pretty much blatantly say ""We don't know how to get people into this show"".

And even then, how does becoming a woman add anything to the Doctor? Writers were never pressured to write the Doctor as a man before, so now that there's this change, what are they supposed to do? Just write normally? Then what's the point of changing the gender?

If the Doctor keeps behaving like the Doctor (gender neutrally) it's just putting tits on a character and it's pointless. If the Doctor starts acting all feminine it's derailing the character *and* being sexist *and* being pointless. There's really no real way changing the Doctor to female brings anything beneficial to the table from a producer's perspective *and* the perspective of a fan.

I understand that you've got a fine discussion going here, and I'm quite glad you've recomposed yourself, but that relapse into childish swearing was pretty unbecoming of you. You're clearly capable of much better and I do commend you for pulling together and continuing with decorum.

Really I'm not getting the motivation. Yes, you theoretically might be able to, but there's really no reason why and at this point (eleven regenerations in) it would be a sudden and unnecessary change made simply to break status quo and not actually bring anything to the character that would ultimately act as a key mark of the show jumping the shark.

Out of all the many, many, many, many ways to explore the Doctor's character, gender seems supremely superficial (particularly in the Doctor's case) and seems more like a stunt cast than something more substantial like having the Doctor ruminate on the genocide's he's committed and coming to terms with them, or investigating his past roles as a father and grandfather.

Out of all these unique ways to explore and further the character, adding tits and a vagina seems supremely superficial and not really vital to the character as a whole.",0,1333857443,null,0,false,0,c49pu1h,t3_ry424,t1_c49pu1h,t1_c49plor,null,1428676961,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
