true,the_nell_87,uk,Scot in London,"Now that's the first sensible and plausible argument I've heard on the issue; that if private sector firms are publicly funded, they could potentially undercut the NHS. 

But claiming that that is the intention or spirit of the bill is sheer cynicism. Even in the top link you provide (which is, by the way, not about this bill at all), a health minister says:  
&gt;This government will not rig the market in favour of the private sector by giving them contracts that are unfair to patients and taxpayers. That's why we have made it illegal for this, or any future government, to deliberately favour the private sector

I agree that heading to an american style system would be stupid; but most other European countries have publicly funded private healthcare providers. As long as healthcare remains publicly funded, and free to all, everything is fine as far as I'm concerned.

As to so many NHS people being against the bill - I don't know what to think of that. That by itself is by no means convincing me that it's a bad thing. Pretty much all of the articles I've seen about some professional body voting that it's a bad idea have basically said ""The bill is bad because these people say it's bad"" - without saying what they specifically don't like. The whole thing? One specific clause, or the lack of one specific thing that should be there? If all these people have problems with the bill, they should be speaking to the MPs and Lords who are discussing it, and proposing amendments to it, or highlighting specific concerns, rather than simply whining to the press that ""it's bad because we say it's bad"".

As a slight tangent, triggered by you mentioning that you live in Edinburgh - this is a classic West Lothian issue if ever there was one. Most Tory MPs (and Peers) support this, and most Labour MPs are against it. But English MPs are overwhelmingly Tory.

Ferguson would regularly drop Berbatov last season when he was the premier league's leading scorer. Do Meireles, Mikel, Romeu, Malouda, Kalou all need to be sat down and given an explanation as to why they don't get picked sometimes? 

I do see both sides to the coin though. Lampard is a club legend who will obviously be upset when he is dropped so maybe explaining to him the whole situation could have helped. However, this is just a professional style, I'm sure many coaches behave in this manner. This should be a courtesy not a contingency of the job. It shouldn't be motivation to resent the manager and complain it should be motivation to improve performance. 

For me I don't even mind Lampard getting upset that he's not playing. Every player should feel this way. But there was a comment along the lines of ""Chelsea need to be winning every game if *I'm* not playing"" which I really disliked. You don't hear players at Manchester United talking like this. They believe in squad rotation and contributions that even bit part players make towards winning the title. I won't even get into the fact that Chelsea *were* winning at a higher percentage when Lampard wasn't playing.

The kind of comments I would have liked to hear from Lampard, which we haven't heard all season, are things talking about squad unity, every player has a role, the team and the manager are together, we are going to fight and win etc... These are the comments players like Terry, Luiz, Mata, Ivanovic, Cech and even Sturridge were making. For a club legend I would like to see Lampard lead this team a little better.

&gt;At the police station, Green went through the normal reception processes and in accordance with standard procedure was asked to nominate a person to be notified of his arrest and to whom he would be allowed one phone call. Green nominated Andy Coulson and was allowed to make one call to Mr Coulson. At that time Mr Coulson was Director of Communications for the Conservative Party. Then, following a consultation with his solicitor, Green claimed to be too tired to be interviewed (at about 8.55pm). He later agreed to be interviewed but declined to answer any questions put to him. Upon being released from the police station Green attended the front of the Palace of Westminster and gave a live TV and press interview claiming he was innocent, that he had only been doing his duty as an MP and criticised his arrest.

I'm always intrigued whenever someone makes the point that they have the right to live their life as they choose. So which one of the hundreds of laws you encounter every day do you break and why? I mean, which is deemed the most oppressive in your view?

Not walking on the motorway? What about paying tax in general?

I said nothing about whether or not you should use the health service we have. To be clear (even though I'm sure you understood my point) - if you work in the health service and see the damage inflicted by prolonged excessive drinking (not that this article was implying that over 45s are doing that) then you might not be so quick to assume that ""the man"" is trying to take every little bit of joy away from you. Just because there's a (potential) government campaign to get people to think about their alcohol consumption doesn't mean you *have* to cut down. The same applies to smoking.

Taxation of tobacco etc. brings in *far more* revenue than is expended on the smoking related diseases on the NHS. So why should the state care about people smoking? With regards to your view, or indignation, that the government wants to stop *you* from drinking so much, have you taken a second to consider that a campaign might not be aimed at *you* but perhaps more at the less informed sections of society? If it weren't for 'safe drinking/sex/smoking' campaigns by the state, the information about potential risks might not be so well known.

Asbestos has been in use for 4,500 years. It's naturally occurring and useful. Many people made/make their livelihood from it - mining or manufacturing. A couple of uses were as a cheap fire retardant material or brake pads for cars: saving people from fire and crashing their cars - both good things.

Was it right for the state to impose restrictions around asbestos? What's it got to do with them, regulating how people live or what materials they use?

And yours wasn't?

&gt;Firstly, it is already adequately covered by the Harrassment Act of 1997. 

No it isn't that is the whole point. (duh) If it was fully covered then the police would have the power needed and stalking would be taken more seriously. There is no clear definition at the moment of what constitutes stalking. 


&gt;Secondly, we have very specific laws surrounding the sale and ownership of knives, especially with regard to children, none of which have reduced the incidences of knife related crime and stabbings among teenagers.

Totally not related to the post and a very poor comparison. Teenagers are one group of people, stalking can be done by any age. You are comparing two different crimes with different social aspect to them, if you are going to build a strawman at least make it slightly reasoned. 

&gt;From watching the news this morning, it seems like most of the supporters of this poorly thought out proposal want a permanent police presence outside their front doors. More law won't make them feel or actually be any safer, so let's stop pretending that making laws changes anything.

Oh yes because news reports are always unbiased and present everything in an equal light... who is pretending here? 
Laws will not stop stalking, but it will better protect those who are suffering. Why would anyone be against that? I would like to know one solid reason why a change in the law would be a bad thing?

Walking on the motorway is retarded, but you're welcome to do it. Darwin would be proud.

Regarding tax, my money is my money. I don't see why I need to hand over more than a fifth of my earnings to a politician to decide which one of his friends or sponsors has supported him best, when I can decide for myself via a free market.

&gt; if you work in the health service and see the damage inflicted by prolonged excessive drinking... ...then you might not be so quick to assume that ""the man"" is trying to take every little bit of joy away from you.

Oh, I see. I oppose this intrusion in to peoples private lives because I don't understand, right?

I've seen it thanks, and I thought then the same as I think now - if you want to drink yourself to death, mate, then it's your funeral. And he did. And we buried him.

&gt; Taxation of tobacco etc. brings in far more revenue than is expended on the smoking related diseases on the NHS. So why should the state care about people smoking?

What's your point here? There are already calls for the NHS to deny healthcare to smokers, and have been for some years now...

&gt; have you taken a second to consider that a campaign might not be aimed at you but perhaps more at the less informed sections of society?

""Guiding the ignorant masses""? Give me a break. No one is so uninformed that they need some finger wagging do-gooder interfering in their lives. 

And even if they did. What's it for? So they can raise the age of retirement again? Maybe squeeze a few more productive years out of us before we die? 

That sounds so caring. As caring as the phrase ""it's for your own good"".

&gt; Was it right for the state to impose restrictions around asbestos? What's it got to do with them, regulating how people live or what materials they use?

By the time they banned it, the information was already public knowledge so people could have chosen for themselves. 

The Government did nothing about the asbestos that was already in private buildings, so it was left to the owners to do something about it. Schools are different but a whip-round could easily have been organised by neighbourhood committees, parents groups, churches etc to have it removed. 

We've had the Welfare State for all of 50 years now, but you seem to think it's the natural state of humanity. Do you really think that if it were not for the guiding hand of our political elites, then the world would collapse and we'd revert to savagery?

Jesus, could you be any more of a shill for the police state?

But I'll bite: let's say this legislation passes. Are you now saying that it will work against all age groups *except* for teenagers?

&gt; Laws will not stop stalking, but it will better protect those who are suffering.

They won't protect anyone because making laws doesnt stop crime.

&gt;No, the majority of intractable costs in the NHS are labour costs

Patently. Its a large human centric organisation, with manual activity at its very core. You can't automate healthcare. You (arguably) can automate records management and common/homogeneous activities (e.g HR, finance, property services etc) to a point. Only it turns out that share service model is fundamentally flawed as it simply shifts the activity cost from one place to another. Generally resulting in inefficiencies elsewhere (primarily staff time divert from their core tasks to routine task that were previously undertaken by the business unit that has been 'automated'. I've seen it happen in 3 different public sector organisation, in 2 different countries. 

Baumol's Cost Disease is a flawed model, that is not directly ascribable to any actual real example, unless you factor the other changes made in society, that have led to an increase in the real / comparable cost of undertaking any activity. Cost of living. Inflation. Cost of Housing. Cost of transport (separated out from living costs as they have grown in recent years disproportionally to the base living costs of food/energy etc). Factoring in the increase costs of training, health and safety overheads, legislation changes, technology developments (both IT/infrastructure and domain specific). 

&gt;IT does not make things cheaper

Again, IT does not necessarily make things cheaper, unless you factor in the lifecycle cost of any system, and use it effectively for that lifecycle. Which in the case you 'cited' is arguably exactly what is going on. 

Where in your 'expert' world view of healthcare IT is the advantage gained by the taxpayer to the myriad of failed large IT projects, 'delivered' by the private sector.

The ideas are related: we are holding two sets of people to opposite standards. We are saying the rich have a problem because they don't have enough, whilst pointing towards the poor and saying there is a problem because they have too much. That is absurd, dishonest or down right sadistic.

I'll point out more naive assumptions, the assertion of a private/public divide, there are market forces or that market forces get to decide anything. What we have at present is an artificial environment being engineered by people to suit their own minority needs, increasing their share of the collective wealth by impoverishing a majority: environmentally, legally, socially, prospectively, intellectually, politically, etc, etc.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"As long as you run in a system with a business model that revolves around shareholders receiving a proportion of the profits made. This results in the financiers/shareholders pressuring businesses to keep costs at a low in order to maximise their returns, and in turn results in some of the negative aspects of a society that runs on this model. 

What this comes down to is this - the businesses of this country have no reason to create new jobs if the population by and large is able to generate some kind of profit and keep the business afloat. They are under no obligation to spend more money than they want to. With wages being a 'cost' to the business, they have secured in some sense the ability to keep wage costs down for employees between particular ages.

I ultimately believe that in getting this freeze on the minimum wage, I predict no increase in job creation but an increase in profits. This will in turn somehow translate to an argument that it is economic activity and thus economic growth, and we will have once again been screwed over by what I perceive as an increasingly seemingly weak government that is either being manipulated by market forces or wholeheartedly embraced market forces prior to coming to power, neither of which really bodes well.

There are plenty of people suggesting the abolishment of the minimum wage on here these days, which while it looks like it would supposedly fix some of the issues, the transitional period would be devastating. Does anyone really think that wages and prices would correlate that fast, if at all? I would expect a massive hike in the welfare bill to maintain subsistence, simply because I believe businesses would not be willing to slash their prices at the expense of profit.

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"&gt;As a slight tangent, triggered by you mentioning that you live in Edinburgh - this is a classic West Lothian issue if ever there was one. Most Tory MPs (and Peers) support this, and most Labour MPs are against it. But English MPs are overwhelmingly Tory. Much of the Labour opposition to the bill is coming directly from Wales and Scotland, where the bill doesn't apply. In a devolved English Parliament of some kind, this bill would have been passed with much less opposition.

Is much of the opposition really coming from Westminster MPs based in Scotland? I haven't really heard any, but then I don't pay a great deal of attention to them since, as you quite rightly point out, the West Lothian issue means they're largely irrelevant here. I don't disagree with your implication by the way - the West Lothian question is an absurd situation that drives resentment south of the border towards Scotland and I want rid of it as soon as possible, probably in favour of independence, but at the very least in favour of devo-max, and any situation where Scottish MPs don't get to vote on English only issues - I'm quite sure that (rightly) drives people that live in England as mad as it drives me that the party of government decides foreign policy when it has only a single MP in Scotland, for example. I believe the SNP are the only party whose Westminster MPs take a principled position on that matter and don't vote on English only issues. That Labour, Lib Dem, and the solitary Tory do is pretty outrageous.

However, I don't think a devolved English parliament is a practical solution because of the costs involved; it'll be too expensive to set up yet another parliament in England, with its own MPs, own elections, etc, etc. Furthermore, that'd look very much like federalism, which is antipathy to the Tories and to Labour, and would be impossible to implement without devolving further power to Scotland which seems to be something they want to avoid (or at least maintain tight control over).

Aaaanyway, I really don't mean to start that debate here though, so apologies for going off topic. You'd be very welcome over on [/r/Scotland](/r/Scotland) if you want to have a chat about it there - as you can imagine it's a hot topic!

Back on this topic, and yeah, the York GPs thing isn't a result of this bill, but it's this bill that's given them licence to do that - they're acting in anticipation of sanction - and I think this bill will result in more situations like that one. I'm sorry to say you absolutely hit the nail on the head when you used the C word...I'm definitely a cynic when it comes to what government ministers say they're going to do, and what they actually do. While they may have made it illegal for this or future governments to deliberately favour the private sector, that doesn't mean that will never change in the future, or even that the plan isn't specifically to change it in the future despite what they say now. I'm afraid I am just that much of a cynic, and I really do believe the intention of this bill is to pave the way for privatisation.

I dunno. I believe this government - well, the Tories at least - are probably the most right wing lot we've had in a long, long time. They're to the right of Thatcher, certainly, and she wasn't shy of privatising a thing or two. Letwin, one of their key strategists, is a huge proponent of privatisation. I haven't read it, but he's published a book - a ""manual"" - on how to privatise industries, and I can't believe they don't want to do the same thing here. I absolutely hear what you're saying about how this bill won't itself result in you having to pay when you go see your GP, but I genuinely fear that's the way it's going, and that we're on the road to an American-style system. Perhaps - and hopefully - not, and perhaps this will improve things, but I really fear it won't.

If you're interested in the specifics, and apologies if you've already seen it, here's a link to the BMA website that explains why they're opposing the bill in its entirety: http://www.bma.org.uk/images/nhsreformbriefingbmaopposesbilldec2011_tcm41-210946.pdf (PDF), and here's another one from the RCN which explains why they're opposed: http://www.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/359726/RCN_Parliamentary_Briefing_on_the_Health_and_Social_Care_Bill.pdf (also PDF).",0,1331231859,null,0,true,0,c3yzf6r,t3_qn4z4,t1_c3yzf6r,t1_c3yy5zy,null,1428489915,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Well no, because I had real world examples and referred to UK law, 

No you pulled out one example of knife crime, which is not related to stalking in any way. I could state that banning the sale of alcohol to over 21 in supermarkets has done nothing to curb teenage drinking levels, and it has''t, but that is nothing to do with the stalking law. 

&gt;whereas your argument was pulled out of your backside.

Typical response of the hard-of-thinking. Actually, my argument is based on real life experience, that is how I *know* the current law does not cover it fully. Try and see if you can let that filter in through the dense matter without me having to spell it out to you. 

&gt;Jesus, could you be any more of a shill for the police state?

Yes because being in favour of one law makes me a proponent for a police state. Do you have a sheet of these that you just reel out on here without actually putting any thought into the response? Do you actually think I am for the police state based on one comment on one law or is it just easier to say that as an 'insult'? It has the intellectual depth of calling someone 'four-eyes'. 

&gt;But I'll bite: let's say this legislation passes. Are you now saying that it will work against all age groups except for teenagers?

Oh gawd you really are stupid aren't you? It is rare I ever have to resort to calling someone stupid on here, but that comment defies belief. I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it was you trying to divert the discussion on a non-point. 

&gt;They won't protect anyone because making laws doesnt stop crime.

Let's try to illustrate the point once more: Murder is illegal and has been for centuries, there's no ambiguity in the law, no grey areas. 

Right I will put this in simple terms, because you seem to be confused about what I am saying. Either that or you are so steeped in your own self-importance that you just parrot out the same thing over and over again without realising what the other person is saying. 
I could not agree more with the point 'making laws does not stop crime', that is very true, and in that seam, making prison sentences longer does not deter criminals, because people don't commit crime assuming they will be caught. However that isn't the point with the stalking law, the laws surrounding harassment do not adequately cover stalking, that is why we need a new definition. It may not stop people being stalked in the first instance, but it will give police greater powers to intervene at an earlier stage. 

As a small aside, you mention no grey areas in murder... hmm apart from self-defence, manslaughter, and unlawful killing of course... they can all be defined as murder but all have different circumstance. Death is not a grey area, murder is.

I think I mentioned earlier that some people might not know the risks. I I said earlier: it is not all about you.

&gt; What's your point here?

Altruism/basic humanity/not wanting to see others suffer needlessly for want of education.

&gt; ""Guiding the ignorant masses""?... No one is so uninformed

Well shit I guess all those surveys and studies and findings that show people don't realise the long term health risks of drinking are all a load of bollocks? But I'll just refer back to how this conversation started: You decided that a survey to find out how much people are drinking was a thinly veiled prerequisite to the state interfering with how much *you* drink. The fact that you have that reaction implies (and you later confirmed it) that you understand the dangers of excessive drinking.

&gt; So they can raise the age of retirement again? Maybe squeeze a few more productive years out of us before we die?

The world is out to get *you*. Yes indeed. The only reason a state might wish to ensure that all members of society live long and healthy lives is so that they can drain a little bit more productivity out of them. *Every single person* working on such issues is out to get more out of *you* and people like *you*.

Christ I thought I was a cynic...

Yes, this government, one no one actually voted for, doing things people find abhorrent: mandatory unpaid labour, privatisation of healthcare and policing. We don't live in a democracy, I would like to live in one. Just to make things clear, I find party politics as detestable as the binary political spectrum; I neither come from the left nor right.

Where I do come from are principles based on human needs, one very simple one is you don't improve (subjective of course) a people by debasing it. You could even say that is a truism. I don't want to live in a stratified economy, because interest, culture, fun, well-being, innovation, intelligence and creativity become oppressed. I'm not sure where I stand on taxation, but right now considering how it is mis-spent on wars of economics, vanity projects and corporate welfare, anything that can be done to avoid it should be taken.

That's true, but what makes stalking such a unique crime? A crime is a crime, no?

My point - a point that you agree with - was that legislating against something does not stop it from happening.

&gt; Typical response of the hard-of-thinking. Actually, my argument is based on real life experience, that is how I know the current law does not cover it fully.

Haha, thanks for the chuckle :) I'm afraid personal anecdotes are not a useful replacement for verifiable facts, but a crutch for the ill-informed.

&gt; I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it was you trying to divert the discussion on a non-point. 

Well, you're very kind but I'd still like you to answer the question :) 

Your comment implied that there is or should be a difference in how the law is applied to people in their teens and how it is applied to people of all ages (presumably including teens). I just wanted some clarification on that point.

&gt; you mention no grey areas in murder... hmm apart from self-defence, manslaughter, and unlawful killing of course...

I meant there are no grey areas in the law. Murder, self defence, manslaughter and unlawful killing are all clearly defined legal terms, and I was talking about murder. Was that not clear? 

But to your main point...

&gt; the laws surrounding harassment do not adequately cover stalking, that is why we need a new definition. It may not stop people being stalked in the first instance, but it will give police greater powers to intervene at an earlier stage.

Well, this harks back to what I said about your advocacy of police state in a way. You took offence to what you saw as a shallow point, so I will expand it here.

The issue is not really that the law doesn't adequate account for stalking, rather that the police don't have the time and resources to gather the burden of proof necessary to successfully prosecute.

In such an instance, it's too easy for the Government to simply lower the bar and make it easier for the police to just 'make an arrest' instead of dedicating more police resources and that is exactly what this proposal is about. 

It's a lazy, short-term solution and it is too open to abuse.

You find it amusing? Ok then. You would be great over on r/mensrights, they would love your kind of humour on there. If i was feeling malicious I would ask what you were worried about... 

 That scoff at my experience shows what a type of person you are, my 'crutch for the ill-informed' comes from 2 years of being stalked, 3 assaults,  moving house, home and job and finally ending up with my stalker in prison for GBH. (mine). The worst part is the mental torture, the things they can do to scare you but are at the moment quite legal, ask any other woman who has been through it.Yet you think it is laughable?  I got off lightly compared to some, but that is how I know harassment laws do not cover stalking. And then there are people like you who think that it is 'just another law' like the dangerous dogs act huh? Made up on the spot as a knee-jerk reaction. This law it for the police as much as it is to help protect victims of stalking, there are serious flaws in their lines of communication, and how each force, ( and officer) deals with complaints of stalking. Those flaws have directly lead to the deaths of women. Women ( and men) will still die at the hands of stalkers, nothing can ever stop that, but it will enable offenders to be flagged up much earlier in the system by regarding some of the more 'minor' offences as more serious. 

It is a pity we have had to have this conversation in this manner, because many of your points about re the terrorism laws, and laws in general I agree with and there could be fruitful discussion. But you seem set on disregarding this stalking law without considering the implications. You cannot dismiss laws 'just because it is another law'. But then if you can dismiss a victims experience as  'a chuckle' then there is no point in carrying on discussion.

true,Manic_Miner,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt; I wonder if there was a spate of young people doing it, would you support, or at least understand, a government campaign behind it?

I suppose I wouldn't oppose a politician expressing an *opinion* on it. I wouldn't see the point in, say, banning walking on the motorway though. I do think, however, that the best - and the first - people to take action on it would be their parents.

&gt; I see. 20% is OK. 21% not OK.

Oh come now. Let's not be facetious.

&gt; I said earlier: it is not all about you.

True but in this case we're talking about our opinions here, really, and they are as much about ourselves as about the matter at hand. 

However, you seem to have overdeveloped this as a 'self' theme, which is inaccurate but I'll address that later.

&gt; Altruism/basic humanity/not wanting to see others suffer needlessly for want of education.

People do what they want to do and they make their own choices. The tragedy of humanity is that we just don't listen, or we just don't care. You can't legislate human nature away.

&gt; I guess all those surveys and studies and findings that show people don't realise the long term health risks of drinking are all a load of bollocks?

That may be so, but it's still not the job of Government to educate them :)

&gt; The world is out to get you. Yes indeed. The only reason a state might wish to ensure that all members of society live long and healthy lives is so that they can drain a little bit more productivity out of them. Every single person working on such issues is out to get more out of you and people like you.

This goes back to my earlier point about the theme of self that you appear to be developing, implying that my opinions are either a product of selfishness or are confined to myself or ""people like me"".

But what if that were true? In this paradigm, the Government is keeping an eye on what we eat, drink and do because it improves our lives. It would have to be run by incorruptible and wise people who rule with an almost parental sense of selfless duty and genuine concern. Oh brave new world that has such people in it!

This touches on the final point in my last post, the one that confused you. 

We both know that the above is not what Government is really like. It's not the role of Government to tell individual citizens what they should be doing with their own lives. 

It's utterly unprecedented in the UK and it reeks of the sort of evangelical puritanism that comes out of the US. In fact, it's no different to the pontificating of a priest and, just like the tithes of old, we have to pay for the privilege of being lectured.

* Wage gap

http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm

* slut-shaming

Pretty obvious one here. Difference in perceptions of sex between men and women. Men as 'players' and women as 'sluts' when they engage in the same amount of sex.

http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100418065544/

http://homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/Sexualisation-of-young-people2835.pdf?view=Binary

This paper goes in depth on the sexualisation of children and the power of slut-shaming in regards to sexualisation.

* differences between perception of females in power (female bitches vs. male go-getters) 

Again, common sense will help you to understand this one.

http://www.faqs.org/health/topics/8/Gender-roles.html

http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/23/management-issues-workplace-forbes-woman-views-worst-bosses.html

* women still expected to be the primary care-givers to children and household presence

http://www.newamerica.net/files/archive/Doc_File_1504_1.pdf (American study, but easily extrapolated data)

Again, common sense here, backed up by pretty much every mainstream film in existence, including pretty much the entire back catalogue of Disney and Pixar films. Also the fact that historically women were seen as housewives and not workers (up until the 1960's definitely in mainstream advertising)

* hate motivated sexual assault levels much higher for women.

Again, common sense here.

Rape is the most under reported violent crime: 

http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf

different levels of rape in men vs. women, also convictions for rape vs. actual rapes:

* high rate of references in popular culture which restrict a womans possible gender roles

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/article804590.ece

Common sense again. Disney princess films show that women are incapable of saving themselves and require a prince. Recent movement towards balancing this our with Pixar (?) movies like Tangled and the new one about the scottish girl archer, but these still fail in regards to the women being self-sufficent. The woman still needs a price to save her and make her happy.

* rape used as a weapon against women during wars

Massive and well-documented history of this happening.

* You may be able to get away with just working harder and asking for more help, to push up the grades of your summer exams to bring you up to the level you wanted, also if your subject has coursework, scoop up a boat load of marks on that.

* Don't worry too much, you can re-sit exams as many times as you want, I entered the same physics exam 3 times (forgot to turn up to one of the resits) and know a few people who sat the same exam 4 times.

Sure: [""Agricultural intensification is by far the major factor in the decline of most wildlife in Britain. Wildlife may suffer from fox
predation if species are already reduced by habitat loss, pesticide use or other factors. Thus foxes do not pose a
significant risk to conservation interests and there is no justification for widespread fox control on conservation grounds
.
.
.
It is clear that fox numbers are stable, that fox populations are largely self-regulating, that the ban on hunting is
unlikely to have any impact on fox numbers, that widespread culling has no detectable impact on fox numbers and
that the economic impact of foxes is low compared to many other species of wild animals in Britain. This is,
therefore, an ideal opportunity to review what further information we need about the ecology and impact of foxes to
identify when and why problems are likely to occur and, should problems arise, design better and more cost-effective
methods of addressing these problems.""](http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/After-the-Hunt.pdf)

&gt;You do realise that fox hunting was always about class war and had nothing what-so-ever to do with the actual animal right?  
 
You do realise that the hunting community is made up of all classes(which they often boast about), so who exactly is this supposed classwar against? You don't get much more traditionally working class than the [Banwen Miners Hunt](http://www.banwenminershunt.co.uk/page2.htm), meanwhile the majority of the royal family are keen hunters. Likewise, hunt staff and kennel hands are from all walks of life so I'm sorry, but classwar-ing housewives are not the only opponents to hunting.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm probably repeating what a lot of people have said but I think our best bet is playing with VDV and Adebayor up front with Defoe coming on at about the 65th minute to actually have an impact on the game. That's our first team. 

If we're against smaller teams then I think he should be allowed to start so someone else can rest (VDV, Adebayor) I know Saha has been doing well, but he should be a stop-gap. Defoe needs to be kept playing, and kept happy.

I love Defoe. Love him. But at the end of the day, we need Adebayor leading the line and VDV also has a better record of scoring (and I think is better at linking up play) then Defoe. 

I hope he gets more of a chance and doesn't get disillusioned. I want to keep him, because he can do it. He can score goals and change matches...but so can Rafa, and Adebayor.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I disagree, and I'll tell you now for why (obnoxiously long post incoming).

We need to take 4 strikers into next season. We currently have Adebayor, VdV, Defoe and Saha. I agree that Adebayor doesn't quite cut it as an out and out top class striker, so I would like us to sign one - Remy and Damaio being the top choices to play alongside VdV in the first XI where I'm concerned.

Now I think it's likely we can all agree that at 34 going into next year, Saha isn't going to be up to the role of main back up striker, the man we turn to when one of VdV and Remy/Damaio is injured. Maybe we keep him as an extra back up, but we're probably going to let him go.

What about Defoe? Do we really think he has what it takes to be that main back up striker? He's great off the bench and even when starting this year has a good strike rate, but he's hardly an ideal replacement for a Remy/Damaio - if we lose that main striker and Defoe is the go to option, I think the team suffers, especially if it's for a sustained period. I wish he did, I love Defoe, but as much as he's improved recently I still don't think he has the all-round game to play that role in a top squad.

So if they aren't options, that means bringing in someone new for the role. Alongside bringing in Remy/Damaio, that seems like a tough ask, especially in terms of disrupting the team - we have plenty of other business that needs doing.

So why not fork out and keep Adebayor? He's the ideal main back-up striker, and it seems as though he's grown-up enough to be satisfied with that role. He may cost some in wages (although likely only a 30k/week increase on what we're paying now), but the transfer fee is reportedly going to be only 10-15m and he's already integrated into the squad which is a huge plus over anyone new.

In terms of affording it, look at the list of players it's likely we're going to be looking to offload this summer:

Gomes, Bassong, Corluka, Jenas, Bentley, Dos Santos, Pienaar, Saha, Nelson

I obviously don't know how much those players are going to turn out to be worth, but I'd guestimate around 40m in transfer fees is feasible for that group, as well as shaving 150-200k/week from our wage bill, if we offload all of them.

I think that puts us in a position to comfortably sign a Remy/Damaio (~25m), a Vertonghen (~15m) and Adebayor. If this story about a 50m transfer kitty is true we'd maybe have enough left to sign Hazard (~35m) too, though I don't consider this a priority.

Even with a cheaper winger than Hazard that sounds to me like a squad competing for the top of the league, so that's why I think we should keep Adebayor.",0,1331264526,null,0,false,0,c3z59k3,t3_qnbhm,t1_c3z59k3,t1_c3yzwxd,null,1428492732,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

And cannabis has much much less against it in the literature.  I wasn't trying to make a comparison of harmfulness, just explain why I thought many people might abandon cannabis but stick with heavy alcohol use even to the point of long term harm.  

Dope is just a synonym for cannabis in my circles (Brits of a certain age), in the US it more generally means heroin, but for us, in the times before weed/herbal marijuana, it was more commonly used for hash.  ""Bad reaction"" is a fairly neutral term for the experience one can have with basically anything - you can have a bad reaction to milk (lactose intolerance).  Some people have bad reactions to cannabis, and they're a bit less predictable than those to alcohol (as Ivashkin notes), because they're less related to dose and experience.  There are some people who have an allergy to alcohol, and they tend not to drink, but for most drinkers, they know fairly specifically where 5 beers, a bottle of wine, 10 shots, whatever is going to take them.  Personally, if I threw up after drinking now I would be straight back to the bar/shop complaining about adulterated or counterfeit alcohol - hasn't happened in 20 years or more.  There's a period of titrating your dose and becoming acclimatised with both, but after that, alcohol is relatively speaking smooth sailing for non-alcoholic drinkers; cannabis is always a bit of a lottery for all but the most regular smokers.  Some people, those I was describing above, find alcohol to be a more reliable intoxicant for that reason, and put out of their mind the long term harm for the medium term consistency.

*  Remarks are far better for humanities than sciences, science/maths has pretty well defined answers so it's harder to screw up the marking.

* Requesting your paper back might be better, you can check it yourself for free and see what's going on in your head during exams.

* If you're Year 12 don't worry too much, I got an E in my first further maths paper because I took it too early. I got over 90% in my last Further paper this Jan, and I'm retaking the first in the summer. You naturally get better at these things.

* If you're Year 13 think about what you need to further your education/ career. Don't damage your other exam results out of ego.

* January is always harder than the Summer. Your UMS is based off everyone who took the exam, and Jan's is far smaller and far smarter student pool. 

* I think it's good to start off with a bit of failure, if you peak too early you get complacent and fail when it's more important.

Creating plants that, rather than resisting droughts, need to be replanted every year yet provide a higher yield and growing in places that they couldn't normally. This is a double edge sword as farmers become dependant on the seeds yet, at the same time, the man made genus probably wouldn't have been purchased or developed if it had no benefits over an original. Seeds are cheap, identifying genes and creating new types of crops is not.

With that said; in my opinion (as someone who dabbles in the computational side of the science) GM, when done correctly where the motive isn't *just* for profit, isn't really that different from selective breeding, which we do *all the time*; our very existence has an incredibly complex relationship with nature and our enviroment. Increasing the yield from plants, biofeuls, improved sunlight efficiency, increased CO2 -&gt; O2 production; these are just some of the examples of where GM and plant biology generally can help improve the enviroment we take for granted and continue to destroy.

It should (and somewhat does) follow a model similar to drug development and clinical trials; limited granted patent times and high levels of regulation to restrict despicable behaviour and monopolies.

But isn't the law based in morality? Not specifically, but shouldn't the principles of the law ought to be based on fairness? I'm not saying that's the current situation, but when people are ""legally correct"" (""the best kind of correct"") it rarely feels like justice is being served.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Its not entirely BS, companies like Monsanto are doing some pretty awful things to control the world agriculture markets. Creating plants that, rather than resisting droughts, need to be replanted every year yet provide a higher yield and growing in places that they couldn't normally. This is a double edge sword as farmers become dependant on the seeds yet, at the same time, the man made genus probably wouldn't have been purchased or developed if it had no benefits over an original. Seeds are cheap, identifying genes and creating new types of crops is not.

Monsanto have done more to harm the progress of GM crops than all the anti-GMO groups put together! So yes, I agree with that one. But Greenpeace ( and other anti-GMOs) have put so much BS out there, along with the media hype. 

&gt;With that said; in my opinion (as someone who dabbles in the computational side of the science)

Ohhh what is your bribe rate? Come do my genomic side of my work.... I lose the will to live with it..!! :-) 

&gt;GM, when done correctly where the motive isn't just for profit, isn't really that different from selective breeding, which we do all the time; our very existence has an incredibly complex relationship with nature and our enviroment. Increasing the yield from plants, biofeuls, improved sunlight efficiency, increased CO2 -&gt; O2 production; these are just some of the examples of where GM and plant biology generally can help improve the enviroment we take for granted and continue to destroy.

I agree, the general public don't seem to like the idea of engineering being done 'purposefully' in the petri dish but accept the selective breeding because 'it is natural'. And then there are degrees of acceptance, drugs made with the help of a GMO seem to be more acceptable than food that has been engineered. ( I can cite sources if need be but I expect you know all his anyway :-) ) 

&gt;If there was one word that I could destroy from marketing, though, it would be ""organic""; there is plenty of benzene in organic chemistry (it just is an organic compound), try eating that up.

But the rings are so pretty.... :-)

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Because of all ex-offenders in the United Kingdom, those who commit offences of a sexual nature are among the most heavily monitored. And that's within an probation system that despite what the media might think, is among the best in Europe. Your ""typical"" [and I'm reluctant to use the phrase, as all ex-offenders who come through the Probation service have tailored treatment / rehabilitation / supervision plans put into place] ex-offender will likely be monitored through a number of different means - regular contact with a probation officer, mandatory attendance on rehabilitation programmes, and regular - **unannounced**, home visits.

On top of that, they're required to sign the sex offenders register once a year, notify the relevant authorities of any change of address, any plans to leave said residence for any more than three / four days, and any plans to leave the country.

That's at a minimum. Where applicable, under the 2003 Sexual Offences act, Sexual offences prevention orders can be requested, which can further reduce the ex-offenders risk of re-offending, and aid their rehabilitation.

Introduce the kind of measure you're talking about [and measures such as introducing mass public access to the registers], and you'll simply drive offenders underground.

------------------------Carroll----------------------------

In reality I'm expecting to see Hendo for Kuyt with Adam in the middle and Carra instead of Coates. 

There's the tough choice between Bellers and Downing on the left too. Downing's been in great form recently and Bellers has been a real super-sub when we need him so I'm not sure on that one. 

Kelly and Johnson both offer good attacking options so that's another position battle.

Hendo's a central midfielder but all season we've been playing him out of position to fit Adam in which annoys me. Adam's been sloppy recently and he's always putting in stupid tackles on the edge of the box which you don't want to do with Seb Larsson on the pitch so I'd rather see Hendo in central mid where he can show off what he's got. 

I know Carroll's the big man up top but I don't know if he should be played in front of Suarez or behind him to be honest. I think Suarez is more likely to make the runs off the ball if we put him in front so that's another tricky one. 

so basically, there's loads of position battles in our squad that are completely unsolved. Give it a season or 2 and we'll be a proper threat for Champions League teams, especially if we bring in some big names.

We know that Modric and Parker in the mids can dominate anyone if they give it their all, which is what I personally did not see at the Emirates (that and a 442 when a 451 would have at least put up a challenge). What Livermore has shown is that he is a more than apt player; very dependable, but I would not rush him into a permanent spot in the first team.

Control what? the genes? most GM crops are made infertile for that reason, of course that means the seeds need to be bought each year which leads to accusations of profit first. Can't win on that one. 

And what would happen if GM crops cross with a non-GM crop? The plant would still be heterozygous, that is if it was viable at all. 

Also there have been benefits to farmers planting their non-GM crops next to their neighbours GM crops in terms of pest control. 

&gt;The core issue really is though that GMO at this point are of questionable benefit

Your reasoning for this is? 

&gt;The only reason they are being pushed hard is because patents are due to run out and Monsanto and co need to monetise the work they've done before that. There is a fear that GM could die if the mega corps don't make money from it now so it is being pushed before there is a realistic benefit. 

You picked that up from the net then? Monsanto are not the only biotech company on the planet. Crops are not the only GMO. Think about it before spouting.

Same defensive line except Coates for Carragher. Coates needs some experience and Carragher really has become somewhat of a liability. Bellamy, Kuyt, Maxi, Suarez work really well together, lots of movement and offensive pressure. Downing could start in place of Maxi or Bellamy (depending on his knees), but I still think the Maxi-Suarez-Kuyt linkup is our best offensive threat. Carroll on the bench because he has done nothing to deserve a spot in the lineup. Our results and general play are much better without him.

We dont really need a holding midfielder such as Spearing for this match in my opinion. Sunderland are without a couple key players in midfield and their offensive threat is already pretty poor.

Secondly; you can't have a world-class back up striker? What's idiotic is thinking we can compete with the teams at the top **without** a world-class player or two in reserve. City can call on Dzeko when Aguero or Balotelli are out; United can call on Berbatov when Rooney or Welbeck are out.

There's a reason people don't think it's a ridiculous idea that we sign Hazard when we already have such strength in the positions he plays; if you want to get right to the top, and compete right across the board in all competitions, you need world-class depth in the squad.

It wouldn't be a disaster to not sign him along with another top striker - and he probably wouldn't be my choice if we were only to sign one striker this summer - but if it happens it might just be the addition that puts us in title contention.",0,1331309627,null,0,false,0,c3zab8n,t3_qnbhm,t1_c3zab8n,t1_c3z8b0u,null,1428495112,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; I mean, there clearly was a point in history when the British version of special forces was the one to emulate (I believe we invented it? - commandos?)

Hmm. Sort of. The South Africans invented it really, during the Boer War, which is where we got the term ""Commando"". We then copied and elaborated. We did, however, invent the concept of a small 4+ man team running around fucking things up during the second world war. Before that point, it was not thought small teams could have any significant effect.

&gt; And the SAS and to a lesser extent the SBS were internationally recognised as highly skilled operatives. But, there've been many high profile fuck-ups since the embassy siege, as well as recruiting problems as the military substrate has grown smaller

Yes, and yes. They are people, not walking super-humans. Of course they screw up. They screwed up during WWII too. The first SAS mission resulted in 2/3rds of the force dead or captured with no harm caused to the Germans. It's in the nature of fallible people doing risky things. Despite the smaller size, our Armed forces are still very good by global standards, that provides a good pool to draw from. Which I grant may not always be the case. 

&gt; As too which if any foreign options are better, there I defer to my more knowledgeable armchair generals.

Ouch. Difficult to measure, but I think its beside the point. The only claim that was made was that they were amongst the best, and they certainly are. For now.

EDIT: By the way there is a quite good film called [""Breaker Morant""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080310/), set during the Boer War, which (indirectly) follows the first attempt to emulate a Boer Commando.

Also, I really believe Johnson might be our best option out wide on the right as of now.  Kuyt isn't nearly as effective and henderson is out of place on the wing.  I wish we had someone else but to me he might be the best we've got.

As far as I understand them, the reasons why NI is not considered a country make perfect sense. For a start, unlike England, Scotland and Wales, it has no history of being a sovereign entity. England and Scotland for example, have over a thousand years history of being separate sovereign states. The state of NI in contrast, wasn't created until 1921 and even then, for the first 50 years of its existence all major decisions and legislation were made in London. 

Also, unlike England, Scotland and Wales there is no sense of NI as being a distinct ""nation"" with its own culture/custom/language, etc. It's spilt between a culturallly Irish community and a culturally British one. There is no distinct ""Northern Irish culture"" separate from Irish or British culture. It's similarly spilt in terms of nationality and citizenship between Ireland and the UK, and inhaibitants can have a British or Irish passport or both. Also its geographically organized in terms of the traditional county structure and consists of 6 of the 32 counties of the traditionally conceived of nation of ""Ireland"". And finally of course, unlike Scotland, England and Wales it has no official flag (but this of course is again symptomatic of its lack of distinct ""nationhood"".)

New clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) will arrange provision of fewer government funded health services and determine the scope of these services independently of the secretary of state for health. They may delegate this decision to commercial companies. The
bill also provides for health services to be arranged by local authorities, with provision for new charging powers for services currently provided free through the NHS (clauses 1, 12, 13, 17, and 49), and it will give the secretary of state an extraordinary power to exclude people from the health service.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Well, I don't think they should be kept in normal prisons due to prison violence

I kind of take the point, but ideally no one should face violence in prison.

&gt;but they shouldn't live lives of comfort either, and so should work to pay for their own food and board (as in the US)

Again, I'm not sure how this makes paedophiles and rapists special.  In a perfect world, we'd just put them all on another empty continent, but we don't have any of those, aside from maybe the Arctic/Antarctic which don't really fit the bill.  In many developing countries prisoners pay for their own shit, but what happens is rich prisoners live a good life inside whilst poor prisoners die horribly or end up as goons for rich prisoners.  Not sure how good a model that is.  I certainly don't want them working for corporations, and personally (though you probably don't agree), I don't want them becoming a hidden army of the State.

&gt;Meanwhile, it's wrong to force anyone to do this, so they should have the opportunity for euthanasia.

Should we allow people to have their shoelaces and ties and whatnots in police cells from now on in then?  If suicide is a valid choice in the face of arrest/imprisonment I mean?  At one level I don't disagree - offering the captured soldier a gun with a single bullet to choose the honorable way out has a certain attraction.  But to limit it to the one group so vilified and hated by the majority that even to have the scent of it means you're going to become instantly mentally unbalanced, I think not.  By offering it to this one group you're basically singling them out yourself...  Either all prisoners get the option to top themselves, or none do.  And how will you handle the anger when lots of innocent or mentally ill people chose the ""easy"" option rather than face trial and the risk of imprisonment, or long term or life imprisonment or whatever?",0,1331314185,null,0,false,0,c3zb4a4,t3_qotep,t1_c3zb4a4,t1_c3zav8r,null,1428495590,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Eh, I agree that Defoe needs more playing time (more on that in a minute) but I don't know about Livermore just yet.

I think if we played a 4-3-3 Livemore would be immense. He rarely throws himself around like Parker and Sandro, but on the flipside he's already more composed on the ball than both of them and his passing is usually more intelligent, varied, and even incisive. With 3 in central midfield he could focus on reading the game, positioning himself intelligently, and cutting out passes. 

But I think if we're going to play with 2 in midfield, we need that pure ball winner. It was Sandro against United, it's Parker typically alongside Modric in our best 11.

People can talk all they want about Parker's lack of passing range, but he's undeniably one of the best ball-winners in the league and in a two-man midfield with Modric, I think his skill set is more useful than Jake's. I don't think we need to rebuild our formula around a young player. 

As for Defoe, I think he deserves a run of games while Lennon is out. I assume we'll play VDV on the right and two up front, which worries me somewhat but we are playing teams that we should be able to dominate with 2 in midfield. 

Having said that, with a fully fit team there is no chance I'd start him. VDV behind Adebayor all day. Rafa has been injured so often this season he's almost a forgotten man but if the dude ever gets fit and gets a run of games, he will find his form again and light it up.

true,PSBlake,null,null,"&gt; When were you introduced to Doctor Who?

In 1983. I was four. It's probably one of my earliest childhood memories.

&gt; What order did you watch it in?

The first episode I saw was either *Destiny of the Daleks* or *The Android Invasion*: My local PBS affiliate had them in a weird rotation, and showed an entire story at a time, but aired the stories out of sequence.

Past that point, it would be almost impossible to recall the exact sequence: I watched whatever I could find. As a kid growing up in East Tennessee in the '80s, Doctor Who media was somewhat scarce. What little I managed to scrounge up was typically Tom Baker-onwards. By the age of 12, I had seen probably 90% of the 4th Doctor stories, a handful of the 5th, two of the 6th, and three of the 7th.

Still I hunted: Throughout the Wilderness Years, who media became even more precious to me. By the debut of the Paul McGann movie in 1996, I took comfort in the fact that I had managed to track down and watch every episode in the 26th season, although I won't pretend I understood them at the time. There were still gaps in my viewing history from season 12 onwards, and gaping holes prior to that.

In 2005, of course, I jumped in and watched the new show at every opportunity, in broadcast order. I tried to do this as legally as possible, but I'll admit: I probably violated copyright a few times in order to do so.

In 2006, after taking stock of an embarrassing hodge-podge collection of DVDs, commercially released VHS cassettes, audio reconstructions, and even a few home-recorded VHS tapes which I begged and borrowed from anyone I could, I decided the time was long overdue: I needed to watch the entire classic series, from *An Unearthly Child* to *Survival*. For the missing episodes, I would listen to the audio reconstructions.

So that's what I did. For a year. I barely watched any other TV that year. Sometimes it was glorious. Sometimes it was tedious. Sometimes it was just plain confusing. But I watched it all. Then I restarted the 2005 series, and kept watching from there.

&gt; Who is your favorite Doctor?

Yes, he certainly is. *ba-dum-pshh*

Just based off their performances on-screen, I would probably have to rank Pat Troughton at the top. He so obviously loved playing the character, and brought a playful whimsy to the role which has long since established the broad emotional tone of the show. This is a show which can be silly, heartwarming, thought provoking, and terrifying all in the space of an hour.

That said, diehard fan that I am, I've also listened extensively to [Big Finish](http://www.bigfinish.com)'s output, and have read more than 100 of the 300-odd novels released during the show's hiatus: Based on all that, it would be difficult to pick a favorite. Each has taken the character to new and interesting places, has piqued my imagination in fun and unexpected ways, and generally managed to completely endear me to them.",0,1331316771,null,0,false,0,c3zbldg,t3_qogsw,t1_c3zbldg,t3_qogsw,null,1428495811,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

(Again unless you define NI culture = British + Irish culture). 

However there is a more ephemeral feeling of NI as being a distinct place from GB and the ROI, but does this mean that there is a distinctive NI culture? What does it consist of? I would think a lot of the feeling of NI as dinstinct from ROI is to do with their political separation and their being divided for 90 years. Therefore the two states had very different influences. They have different infrastructure, roads, goverance, urban planning, currencies, signs, NI has its legacy of the conflict and the ROI in the previous decade received a larger economic boom, etc. So ROI and NI towns and cities can feel very different.

true,redem,,Ballymena,"&gt; For a start, unlike England, Scotland and Wales, it has no history of being a sovereign entity. 

Nor does any country until it becomes a country, this is a circular argument.

&gt; The state of NI in contrast, wasn't created until 1921 and even then, for the first 50 years of its existence all major decisions and legislation were made in London.

That just made it an occupied part of the old country of Ireland, given that that is now a separate country that would imply that so is NI.

&gt; Also, unlike England, Scotland and Wales there is no sense of NI as being a distinct ""nation"" with its own culture/custom/language, etc.

Nor did most nations until fairly recently (on the scale of history), the idea of a culturally distinct ""nation state"" post-dates countries rather than predates them.

&gt; Also, unlike England, Scotland and Wales there is no sense of NI as being a distinct ""nation"" with its own culture/custom/language, etc.

On the contrary, it seems a lot of people from here simply assumed that we were a country. Additionally, a country need not have ""it's own culture/language/etc"" to be a country.

&gt; And finally of course, unlike Scotland, England and Wales it has no official flag (but this of course is again symptomatic of its lack of distinct ""nationhood"".)

Only because no-one can agree on one.

&gt; Why don't you think these reasons make sense?

They seem more like you're picking apart minute and irrelevant differences from our history than you're defining the term ""country"" and arguing we don't fit it.

I present [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country#Nations) as an example of how ambiguous the term is, and as an example of how someone who was not involved in this specific discussion has spoken on the general topic before. And please, check the history before assuming I wrote it in a cheap bid for ""points"" on reddit. :p

It seems to me that not only does NI have a history of being thought of and spoken of as a separate country, it also satisfies any other reasonable criteria that apply to all other countries in the world.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Where did you get the idea that mental illness can't be treated from? A couple of things to consider:

Not all pedophiles are bad people and many never harm anyone. They have that sexuality/mental illness/whatever you want to categorise it as, but it doesn't make them a rapist... they can still choose to not abuse children, and having the illness doesn't particularly make someone likely to.

The thing is anyway, is that it can be treated. There was a discussion on here some time ago written by someone in situation A where they had that sexuality and hated it/wanted to be cured/never harmed anyone. Then also there was someone from situation B who used to be like that and had now been cured and was no longer even remotely at risk of harming children (not that he ever did anyway).

Seems to me like if being a pedophile wasn't so demonised in the first place, maybe more people would get help early on and get their mental health issues sorted out, where possible. It's the abusing children part that should be illegal, not having a mental illness. They don't go hand in hand, even though people with that illness are of course more likely to be the ones who abuse.

Eg. if you have schizophrenia should we lock you up just because schizophrenia has caused people to commit murder before?

Which brings me to this... regarding what you wrote below:

&gt; Because they have harmed others, otherwise where do you draw the line with personal responsibility?

If that schizophrenia can be cured/treated with medication to make that person no longer someone who is going to murder someone - should that not be taken into account, or should they be treated like any order murderer?

We all aren't fat, lazy, ignorant rednecks--although I know a few.

There was one where people liven in an iron age village that was somewhat interesting. And one from Michael Palin (I think) about the Middle Ages in Britain. And of course Connections, which aired years ago on some cable channel.

Coming from a country with barely 250 years of real history, I'm fascinated by the history of Britain. As I read somewhere, in the US we think 100 years is a long time, in the UK they think 100 miles is a long distance.

Furthermore, the differences between Wales, Scotland, England and NI in these crucial ways are absolutely not ""minute"" or ""irrelevant"" they are the things that make the place what it is today. For example, the NI state *wasn't* created until 1921, and in what possible sense could that be considered a ""minute"" detail of our history? Seriously? 


That said, I'm not really looking to get into a debate on reddit, but I should just point out that your response or reasoning take no account of the fact that NI is a divided society, with two communities with very different conceptions of nationality and identity and this is essential to the prevention of the development of a sense of nationhood. 

&gt; I suspect that the reason the UK government does not consider us a country is little more than historical baggage from Ireland freeing itself from their rule.

I don't understand what you mean by this. Most of the countries that were previously under British rule are now independent sovereign countries and the UK recognises this, what does the ROI leaving the Union have to do with NI not being considered a country? 

You also have to take account of the fact that according to the UK government Wales is not a country, it is a principality. This is interesting considering that Wales has a much stronger claim to the title of ""country"" with the homogeneity of its citizens in terms of their identity/nationality, its own language, etc. So why then doesn't the UK consider Wales a country either? 

It's because Wales has a long history of political association with England and politically is dependent upon England. NI too has been politically dependent upon the UK throughout its existence and at the same time has deep historical, political and geographical ties with ""Ireland"". For these reasons, NI is best thought of as a province of the UK and of Ireland, rather than its own country.

As of last year, there are 37,225 people on the Sex Offenders Register. Assuming a population of 64M, that's **0.0581640625%** of the population. That number includes people who have been placed on the register for the remainder of their life, due to the severity of the crime they committed.

Or to put it another way - 1 person in every 1719, is on the register [there or there abouts.]. That doesn't mean that one person in every 1719 is a child sex offender - the sex offenders register details people who have committed sexual offences against any person, of any age.

Secondly, going back to people who commit crimes against children - eight times out of ten, the offence is committed by a person known to the child / and or the child's family.

Which brings me to the third point. This article infers that this change to the housing benefit rules will put vulnerable people at risk [by vulnerable, you can include not only potential victims, but the perpetrator themselves, technically.]. Not only is this not the case - as has been outlined, MAPPA &amp; or licence conditions alone should make it nigh on impossible that a person will be put into a position where they can harm anyone [and as per MAPPA requirements, regular unscheduled home visits will quickly flag up any issues, such as new neighbours etc, etc], but as with most reports / articles that deal with child sex offenders - it misses what should be the obvious point. There are plenty of people ""out there"" in the community who are a potential threat to vulnerable people **who aren't on any registers**.

-

Some other things I noticed whilst browsing through the comments - someone asked about the recidivism rate for those convicted and who are on the register. Last year 57 people went on to re-offend. That's around 0.15% of people who're on the register.

some quotes form there:
&gt;Under current law the secretary ofstate has a duty to “promote”
a comprehensive health service and, for that purpose, a duty to
provide specific services throughout England to meet all
reasonable requirements.
2 Although the secretary of state will continue to have a duty to “promote” a comprehensive health service, clause 12 of the bill changes the duty to provide to a duty to arrange when it transfers  from the health secretary to CCGs. This weakens the health secretary’s overarching duty because primary legislation no longer specifies the measures he or she must take to promote a comprehensive health service.

plus

&gt; CCGs would be required to arrange fewer statutory services
than PCTs currently provide or arrange for areas. Under current
“functions regulations,” PCTs must provide or secure the
following services:

(list of services I omited to save space).
&gt;These regulations will be repealed, and the bill does not require
CCGs to secure the above services. They have to arrange only
ambulance services and “emergency care” for everyone living
in the area defined in their constitutions. 

and from the conclusion:

&gt;Legal analysis shows that the bill would allow reductions in
government funded health services as a consequence of decisions
made independently of the secretary of state by a range of
bodies. The bill also fails to make clear who is ultimately
responsible for people’s health services, and it creates new
powersfor charging.

You're looking at Clause 1, largely taken from the 2006 NHS Service Act

From the NHS Service Act from 2006:

&gt;(2) The Secretary of State must for that purpose provide or secure the provision of services in accordance with this Act.
(3) The services so provided must be free of charge except in so far as the making and recovery of charges is expressly provided for by or under any enactment, whenever passed.

and now, after amendment, the Health Bill says:

(2) For that purpose, the Secretary of State must exercise the functions conferred by this Act so as to secure that services are provided in accordance with this Act.
(3) The services provided as part of the health service in England must be free of charge except in so far as the making and recovery of charges is expressly provided for by or under any enactment, whenever passed.

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2010-2012/0119/2012119.pdf

Check out where the 2006 Act says ""must for that purpose provide or secure the provision of services"" and that's changed to ""must exercise the functions conferred by this Act so as to secure that services are provided"". The contentious point is the removal of the requirement to provide, implying that the SoS will no longer be obligated to provide health services. 

Then then look at the wording of sub 3 in clause 1 of the Health Bill and consider the reduced state the NHS would be left in.

Further to your linked comment's issue on the charging of services, then go to clause 10 which says that the responsibility vis a vis decisions about charging for NHS treatment will be removed from the SoS and given to Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Rougly there'll be two hundred plus of these, so it's more than likely that at the very least one will decide that NHS will not pay for common things like cataracts, hips and knee treatments.

Take into account the real term funding cuts the NHS has to deal with and the very real likelihood of service rationing (do not forget that because of this the NHS is currently in crisis due to those cuts and rationing is very likely!). That will involve CCGs telling patients that they are not yet in enough pain for the NHS to pay for their hip operation, or they are not blind enough for a cataract operation etcetera. These people will then, understandably, look to their savings, or cash in life insurance policy, raid their pension fund...anything to get the treatment they desperately need. 

These are the patients who will become private patients in NHS hospitals (since NHS private rates will be cheaper than the private hospitals, just look at Circle's current charges as an example. iirc they are in the region of three times more expensive). 

And that is how the Coalition will privatise the NHS.

&gt;I'm not persuaded by this rhetorical method of assertion followed by a broad reference, without the effort taken to explain.

Good summary of the Bill and Lansley's approach right there.

I'll be sure to post this under your other comment too, for posterity's sake.

You're looking at Clause 1, largely taken from the 2006 NHS Service Act

From the NHS Service Act from 2006:

&gt;(2) The Secretary of State must for that purpose provide or secure the provision of services in accordance with this Act.
(3) The services so provided must be free of charge except in so far as the making and recovery of charges is expressly provided for by or under any enactment, whenever passed.

Simply pointing out ways in which NI is different from the UK, or from Ireland is not enough, we must first decide if these differences are definitive characteristics of a country that NI lacks. None of the ones you raised seem to be examples of that.

Being relatively young, being split along ethnic/religious/cultural/language/etc grounds, and so on, I can name extant countries that have these traits.

&gt; I don't understand what you mean by this. Most of the countries that were previously under British rule are now independent sovereign countries and the UK recognises this, what does the ROI leaving the Union have to do with NI not being considered a country?

None of the rest were in the UK, I suspect that at the point of the Irish revolution the attitude in government was to view NI as largely being a ""province"" waiting to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, in part thanks to the original peace settlement not having a truly independent Ireland.
 
But that did not happen, and as a result of this original concept, we remain officially thought of as a province for no objective reasoning.

I listed off the jobs I had applied for, all being in Newcastle (it's an hour bus journey away, I've traveled between the two for work in the past).

I explained that while I do have experience in those three fields, I'm not going to limit myself to only apply for those fields as I'd rather broaden my options seeing as the competition in all fields is so large.  (I do also have bar experience).

A spokesperson from KfW told the authors of this piece: “The size of the holdings makes KfW one of the largest German banks. It is probably the case that every German company has borrowed from KfW at some time or other. The guarantee provided by the German state means that we make loans to SMEs at rates which mean we can make a significant contribution to economic development.”

Table 2 lists Employment of 16-24 year olds by ethnicity  - quarter 4 each year in the UK. There are more young black people in work now than there has been since 2008. The proportions of young black people as a percentage of 16-24 year old's as a whole is rising seemingly.

So even though employment of young black people has risen by nearly 20% in two years, the proportion of those in employment is falling because of the rising number of young black people reaching working age (I assume this must be the case?) and not getting jobs, remaining in education, etc..

Employment figures for 16-24 year olds just paint a bad picture of our future.

Check the nutrition information and you'll find that protein percentages are a fair bit lower in most cheap products, whereas fat and carbohydrate levels are correspondingly higher. Fat and carbohydrate are cheaper than protein, but the trouble is that fat and carbohydrate are empty calories. If your body needs protein, and you don't eat enough, you will stay hungry - no matter how much fat and carbohydrate you eat.

In any one product, that's not a big deal. But when most of what you eat comes from one discount store, that suggests to me a generally much lower level of protein in your meals - which probably means you'll eat more overall and get fat. And since you probably eat more overall, those cheaper prices are a false economy too.

The TARDIS gets blown off course, and ends up hopping dimensions.  He doesn't know it at first, but it turns out to be Rose's Earth.  IE, the one with the half-human clone 10th Doctor.  The problem is, the other Doctor has gone bad.  (Perhaps when they get there, he's doing something like trying to reactivate the Cybermen labs to make his own army.)  It turns out he was unstable, something about his brain not being able to deal with the conflict between Human and Gallifreyan thought processes, and Rose *couldn't* help him.

So, we're not just doing a ""Doctor + Doctor"" crossover ep.  We're doing a Doctor VERSUS Doctor ep.  Smith vs Tennant, for the gold.  And it doesn't even require a time hole and\or paradoxes.  (Realistically, this would probably be a two-parter.)

I'm not entirely sure how it would turn out, but I'd love to get Captain Jack involved as well, since he presumably doesn't know that the real Ten regenerated.  I could see Anti-Ten hooking up with him and making use of his teleporter bracelet to escape the alternate Earth (this would be the episode-ending cliffhanger), before Eleven catches up and convinces Jack of what's going on.

But, since he's still Ten deep down, I'd like to think that Anti-Ten ends up coming back to the light by the end.  Probably by sacrificing himself to stop some mad scheme that he came to realize was too insane, but it was too late to stop in any other way.

So, dangling plotline resolved, Tennant gets to come back one last time, and we get to see EVIL TENNANT, which has to be about the awesomest thing ever.

Think about it: who would the Doctor be most afraid of? The version of himself that killed everyone he ever loved. Since I never saw anything to contradict this theory (please point out any episode in which it says otherwise), I always sort of believed that the 8th Doctor was the one who fought in the Time War and killed everyone. And it was in using ""The Moment"" that he ended up injuring himself so badly that he had to regenerate into the 9th Doctor, aka ""survivor's guilt"" Doctor. 

I'm basing that theory largely on 9's actions during ""The Parting of the Ways."" He has the option to kill the Daleks and end all life on Earth but he can't go through with it. Arguably, this is because he sees Earthlings as having nothing to do with the Time War but I believe that 9 could never do anything like that. He hates himself for destroying his people but is incapable of destroying another race. Thus, I believe that the ""genocidal Doctor"" was actually 8.

You can freeze the bread too and save it for later in the week, and your own bread typically tastes way better than most in the shops.

In that time Liverpool management have to achieve smaller goals first. Build a new squad, something that is hard to achieve in just two transfer windows, give it another two windows and I bet we'll truly have a squad to be feared. Unfortunately Rafa left us in a bad state, personally I blame the owners but that's neither here nor there. 

Win some silverware to get the confidence and knowledge back that Liverpool can and will win competitions.

The next goal and this is the biggest one is get back into the top four, something which I feared would've been a big ask for us even at the start of the season. Give it another year and we should be back properly challenging for fourth, then you can start talking about the Top Spot.

Seems to be a whole lot more effective that how the courts tend to deal with people like this.

Sorry but the number of friends I have seen hurt / kicked in the head / glassed / punched or in a fight for absolutely no fault of their own. Something needs to be done to people who do this. The court's don't / can't / won't deal with them effectively. If however they happen to kick the wrong person in the head then yes by all means they run the risk of having their legs broken :)

Take somebody who breaks into your house to steal things. You should have the right to kill / shoot / or do anything you want. People will argue about human rights about killing the person. But look at it on the flip side. Most people give up a large chunk of their life to work so they can afford the nice things only to have somebody take them. This is indirectly the same thing as taking part of the ""good hard working persons"" life. Lets face it nobody really wants to work and would rather spend most of their life doing other things other than working.

Quite often the people who end up in a situation with the paramilitary groups are warned multiple times before action is taken by them. Events like these are almost always related to some other type of crime eg joyriding / breaking into houses / drug dealing / etc...

Don't get me wrong, a lot of stuff they sell is fine. I'm not snobblish about shopping in low price supermarkets but some of the things I've had barely qualify as food. The worst was some really cheap wafer thin ham I had from (IIRC) Aldi. 

Wafer thin ham is pretty rank at the best of times but this stuff was like 50-60% fat, 20-30% water, 5% arseholes and eyelids, some pink colouring thrown in to make it look a bit more presentable and the reaming percentage ""unknown"". 
Just touching it when making a sandwitch (I made only one before it went in the bin) would leave little bits of white fat all over your fingers and you'd have to scrub it off with soap.

Now, in its stripped down form, the tram will do nothing more, really, than act as a glorified airport shuttle bus. It has completely bypassed the main commuter source areas to the east of the city (shitting all over the plans to build more residential areas down near the ocean front), and essentially does nothing more than replicate a service already provided very well by the local bus network, (which is arguably one of the best bus networks in the country). Unlike other places which have lots of competition, congested routes etc. Lothian Buses only main competition has been First, and they exist pretty nicely side-by-side. They're prompt, efficient and if they'd put even a fraction of what they've spent on the trams into the bus network, could have even had the greenest fleet of buses this side of Scandinavia.

Talk to any small business owner on Leith Walk too, and they'll give you a fair idea on their thoughts on the matter.

Trams themselves aren't shit, and I quite like the idea of them. *Edinburgh's* trams, specifically. Yes, they'll be shit.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"No - I'm not saying it's any worse than carbohydrate, which calorie for calorie at least is broadly true.

What I'm saying is that your body needs protein. If you don't get enough carbohydrate, fat or protein can do the job. If you don't get enough fat, carbohydrate or protein can do the job. If you don't get enough protein, you have a problem.

Study of the Atkins diet, for instance, has shown that eating more fat and less carbohydrate *isn't* the reason it works. The reason it tends to work is because protein and fat tend to go together, and eating more protein tends to ""suppress"" (word from actual documentary) the appetite. I think that choice of word is odd - seeming to imply that the only reason a major nutrient reduces hunger is by being a mind-altering narcotic rather than by supplying the nutrient that's needed for homeostasis.

Anyway, as a general rule, animal products tend to be high in fat and protein, whereas vegetable products tend to be at least relatively high in carbohydrate.

What's more, if you're hungry, your stress response is more active. And if your stress response is active, your body tends to burn muscle for energy rather than fat, at least once the immediate blood-sugar energy supply is depleted. Since you've burned muscle, you need to replace it - which means you need protein. If you avoid eating through will-power, your muscle mass will reduce over time, reducing your resting metabolic rate so that you burn even less body fat - I'm guessing that's at least part of the evolutionary point, to preserve body fat as long as possible during periods of famine.

Protein is important (though extremely high levels may be harmful). Fat - well, percentages of it are very high in some foods compared with what they should be (e.g. modern beef has more fat than it did a century ago) but most people would be surprised to find out that people generally, even in first-world countries, actually have a lower percentage of fat in our diets than we did a century ago.

The big problematic change is the amount of processed carbohydrate that has been added to our modern diet, which is huge. Particularly problematic - all the snack foods that contain fat and carbohydrate, but no protein, no vitamins or minerals etc etc. If you're already overweight, the last thing your body needs is more calories, yet that's *all* many snack foods provide.

There are fats that are essential to the diet, of course, but these are mostly needed in small amounts. These should be seen more like vitamins and minerals than as an excuse to eat a slab of cheese.

&gt; ""Our main goal is to qualify for the Champions League. If we don't it would be a major disappointment,"" Henry said to the Dagbladet, a Norwegian newspaper.

We are now looking at the prospect of not only missing that fourth spot, but of also failing to improve our league position. This, for me, is not a positive sign. A Carling Cup trophy is nice and I am proud of it, but it's by no means a springboard to success, just look at Birmingham, who were relegated last season after winning the competition. 

A qualification for the Champion's League guarantees a huge amount of additional revenue. FSG, which has been very fair in their transfer policy, realize that the only way we can develop a team capable of winning the league is to first have both the revenue and the reputation to attract the sort of quality players that can reach those goals.

Personally, I am torn on my view of this season. I, like FSG, feel that failing to qualify is a huge disappointment, but our success in other competitions does show the club has the potential to win. Even if we were to finish around 7th again, I wouldn't necessarily think that we should sack Kenny, but I would guess that the following season would be pretty important and a failure to improve our league position would mean that we need to start looking in another direction.

The study I'm referring to was flawed IMO, but nevertheless, I've not seen a convincing proof that ketosis burns a significant amount of calories, whereas I have seen plenty of proof of homeostasis - if you burn more calories, through whatever mechanism, you get hungrier and eat more.

For example, when you burn body fat, you don't end up with fewer fat cells - at least not in the short to medium term. You end up with the same number of fat cells, but less fat per cell. And each cell that feels a bit depleted releases hormones that trigger hunger. Once you have gained more than a small amount of weight, thereby converting pre-fat cells into real and permanent fat cells, your bodies ""fixed point"" is fixed at a new and higher level, and will strongly resist attempts to lose any significant amount of that weight.

Losing weight by willpower means having a sustained high level of stress, which again means that you're losing muscle and reducing your metabolic rate. And if you sustain a stress response at too high an average level for too long, you burn out and become depressed. That's depressed as in a physical state in which energy levels are dramatically reduced (so you're burning even less fat) - not ""feeling sad"".

There is an issue in this which you can't do much about, and which I don't know that much about, relating to types of fat cells which is genetically determined. If you tend to gain ""brown fat cells"" (IIRC), then you're one luck b*****d, since your metabolic rate will tend to increase to burn whatever fat you gain, and you'll never accumulate much body fat whatever you eat, and irrespective of exercise. If you eat a lot, your body temperature will raise a little and that's about it.

true,ColonelMolerat,null,null,"I don't like Lauren Laverne, but if she were replaced, I'd rather they found somebody who *wasn't* a white man. Half of us are women and a fair amount are not white. Let's be a bit representative. Also, just because somebody's a 'token' doesn't mean they can't be good. The production team should see out a new, witty, politically-minded woman. Just because there aren't many on TV doesn't mean they don't exist.

My biggest problem with Lauren Laverne is she's too awkward and scripted. She doesn't seem to have the passionate quick wit of Charlie Brooker and David Mitchell. It sometimes feels like her role is to 'rein in the men'. Find somebody who can join them in their vitriol. Maybe she'd be ok in a few years, or with training at being live. She's too cautious.

Replace Jimmy Carr, too - or at least change his role. His sketches don't really fit in with the programme and apart from those, he just throws out one-liners when he sees a moment. Couldn't his silliness be targeted more towards teasing serious guests, or something similar?

I never watch anything live, anyway, so I don't watch it for being live-and-up-to-the minute. As Nikkeh says, I quite like the unscripted banter that comes from being live (as well as how some of the awkward moments are handled) but it could probably do more if pre-recorded. Perhaps a fairly casual approach to editing could be taken.

Your final point: yes, yes, yes.

What annoys me most is that everything is too short and hurried. It would be nice if the programme was longer, but if the sketches etc were cut and it had fewer, longer, segments, then it would be able to use its time better, I think. Every time it gets going, there's a cut.

I like The Daily Show and although find the American humour quite grating it has some phenomenal moments and does what it does very well.

Basically, I wish it were more serious and biting. Newsnight with funnies, rather than Harry Hill with seriouses.

&gt; Chaudhury vs. EDL: EDL seem more sensible

You do realise how few people 'follow' Chaudhury, yes?

The EDL is/has quite knowingly (well, the upper echelons) created a boogie-man over blowing the issue massively, but that's in assocation with lots of help by the mainstream media who didn't ignore the poppy burning fuckwits in the first place. [Obligatory Brooker link.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4mnUAWmROE)

Should an eye be kept on Chaudhury? Yes. Should an eye be kept Islamic centres? Within reason, of course, but that goes for many religious organisations (massive cover ups of child rape anyone?). But too many people (*cough* EDL *cough*) fail to understand the empathy inherent in most people, even in Muslims! A local bomb plot here in Bristol was thwarted when the guy was [shopped by the guy's fellow mosque goers. (4th paragraph)](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/17/isa-ibrahim-bristol-bomb-guilty)

Obviously not, if someone is wanting to build it.

*That* is another matter entirely, and the way to address the problem is not by discriminating against the people who want it.

I don't like churches. Loathe them. Don't like one of their main reasons for being - belief in a god is ridiculous in my opinion. But I'm a secularist and so I won't bitch and moan when someone wants to build one nearby (within reason) and certainly not because I don't like the people who go in there.

I just feel it is so watered down, you look at Charlie Brooker's News-Wipe his rants and all the Adam Curtis shorts that he showed. It was a funny, intelligent and most importantly it explored the issues, went places other media had missed. 

Also when the group discuss issues, you get a few good points but at times feels awkward and like they are just trying to out gag each other for an audience laugh.

The UK needs a News-Wipe or Daily Show like show and 10' O'clock live is not it. lose Lauren, stop it making it live there is absolutely no need. Expand Brooker and Mitchell roles, lose the shitty gags. Go for witty and insightful, explore the issues show me the other side of the stories, stop  not just making topical puns!

On the other hand, you've got to remember that Nick Clegg's decision to enter coalition with the great enemy of the progressive majority has facilitated the butchering of the NHS, the tuition fees, the damage to Britain's position in Europe and all the other things we hate the Tories for. If Nick Clegg had stuck to the Lib Dem's ideological guns then Diamond Dave would never have had the majority necessary to implement these policies.

Furthermore, I think that if Clegg was playing the ""best friend in government"" role like we all hoped he would, he would be fighting his corner much more strongly. His party could bring down the government but he doesn't seem to be using that to leverage his position at all.

If they are doing such a good thing why has Wikileaks managed to break more stories in its short life than the all of those organisations put together and for a good number of years. Championing the deaths of 'our' soldiers whilst at best ignoring collective military wrongdoing is objectively a form of censorship, as was failing to point out how recent war-mongering has been mostly illegal. Like wise during protests they do their best to first report police injuries, run hours long rolling footage of protestor violence, and in one case the BBC used the arrest of a police employed bailiff (for criminal damage and battery) but allowed the reader to infer he was a protestor. Other things the BBC has done recently, championed the efficiency of the NHS 'reform', and bypassed the debate about wether austerity was needed, instead going straight to 'what shall be cut'. (The little said about you using Sky News as a positive news source the better.)

If you want to look to academia for examples there was a good paper I think out of Glasgow University that went into detailed meta-coverage regarding isreal-vs-palestine. It was no surprise that israeli talking heads where given far more time on MSM.

true,SiliconRain,uk,Briton in Scotland,"&gt;If Nick Clegg had ""stuck to his ideological guns"" it would have meant no coalition at all.

Exactly! I don't accept the scenario you paint afterwards as being necessarily what would have happened. I don't think we're the first punters to speculate as to what would have happened if Clegg had rejected Cameron's advances.

It strikes me as equally likely that, if parliament was hung and a coalition couldn't be formed, another election would have happened within a month. Brown probably would have bowed out in that case as well, giving a Miliband-led Labour party a much stronger chance of a majority and it would have been much easier to organise a lib/lab pact without Brown in charge.

We could speculate until the cows come home. But the decision Clegg had at the time was either:

* Prop up the Tories in a coalition
* Refuse to form a coalition and be blasted in the next election

Yes, it would have been damaging to his party to reject the coalition, but I think he should have put his principles ahead of his desire for power. And he also should have realised how damaging coalition with the Tories would be for his party also. Sure, he was in the 'damned if I do; damned if I don't' position, but I think the latter option would have left him with more integrity.

Whilst people like you empower the paramilitary groups own twisted form of vigilantism we can have no hope of peace and no hope of getting rid of said groups from our towns and cities.

I can guarantee you that anything the boy getting shot has done, the boy doing the shooting has done tenfold so be careful who you entrust with the power of life and death. The boys getting shot are wee scrotes, the boys doing the shooting are career criminals with fingers in most of the pies that poison our communities.

And as to the ludicrous 'burglar' argument, why should people have 'the right to kill/shoot/or do anything you want' in their own home? They aren't allowed to manufacture heroin, they aren't allowed to rob people, they aren't allowed to rape someone in their own home, why should they be allowed to commit murder? What rights do you give homeowners next that none of the rest of the population have? If you're being robbed on the street are you allowed to kill the offender? Actually think for yourself before regurgitating the Daily Mail that you read this morning. 

Your point of view terrifies me. I was beaten up by some spides in Belfast city centre, there was no CCTV evidence and I was steaming so they got away scot-free. Its a shame but shit happens. To imagine being ok with them boys getting shot through the kneecaps because the police weren't able to catch them is completely abhorrent to me. 

Them boys are arseholes and its completely unfair that I was left with a permanent injury and scarring from their attack, but I will not sub-contract my idea of justice to a group of meathead thugs who have probably done the same thing to others like me countless times before.

On paper, perhaps.  If she were to ever use it, she'll lose it, with a real possability of forming a constitutional republic, with the monarchy isolated from the business of government.

This is because it's up to Parliament to make such decisions, and if the monarch steps too hard on that, then they will lose the right to step at all (see Charles the 2nd, and so on).

The only time the monarch can safely use that power is as directed by parliament, or, perhaps, if there were some reason that parliament were clearly unable to continue as is.  I think that would have to be a scenario that managed to eliminate nearly all the extant MP's; or something so dramatic that nearly the whole country agree that it is time to form a new parliament.

Historically, the Monarch has always been able to be petitioned by any noble.  So, even they maintained the power, then you'd have to be a noble to have the right to petition the monarch.

That's an insightful point, aside from the issue we're actually discussing. It's easy to under-appreciate how large an influence the British class system has on party-political allegiance.

Anyway, back to the point:

I don't think you can safely imply that just because Clegg is a member of the third party, he is somehow incorruptible or in no way desiring of power. I strongly believe self-interest (both personally and on behalf of his party) was at the heart of his decision to join the coalition. But it's not just his motivation that is in questions here...

If the alternative to a con/lib pact was (for the sake of argument) a Milliband-led labour majority, it sounds like you would be equally unhappy with that as you would be with a majority Tory government. That's a fine and legitimate opinion to have, of course. But I don't feel that way. I will never vote Labour in my life, but I still trust them at the helm more than the Tories, even with the moderating Lib Dems in place.

1) The creatures are meant to feed off paradoxes/ scabs in time right? Well, it seems that they would be attracted to the TARDIS first. Either they fed off the TARDIS itself, making leaving just the shell behind, or the pocket of time in which the car kept re-appearing prevented the TARDIS from intervening, so that it could be healed on it's own. I can't quite remember, but I think that there's an in-canon explanation which the Doctor provides as he's trying to restore the TARDIS.

2)None of the events which transpired within the deviation ever occurred, which is why all the people came back to life, as the wound in time healed itself, restoring things to the way they were. Jackie was only told about Rose within the deviation, so she was technically never told. I think the reason that Rose, the Doctor and Pete know everything is because everything was focused on them: Rose was the one who changed things, Pete was the one who changed things back, and the Doctor ... well, he's a timelord, I'm sure he has seen this happen before.

3) No definitive answer here, maybe she really is a terrible wife. To my knowledge, I think the point was that, before Rose changed things, no one was with Pete when he died. This time, the only thing she changed was staying next to him as he died. Since Jackie wasn't there before, there was no reason she would be there now unless Rose actively changed things around her.

The reason why people are around to kick the shit of of you is because they get away with it time and time again. It is their idea of fun or a good night out. The problem being is that the courts / jail does not sort these people out. Yet our society keeps doing the same repetitive things with criminals a slap on the wrist and not much else.

In your situation the guys got away. But 9 out of 10 times when people are doing this sort of action to people on the street. Have normally been involved with dealing with the police / courts before and have typically been arrested on several occasions where there has been evidence provided to convict them. So for you, me and everyone else who gets hurt by these types of crimes all the time the justice system fails to keep us safe / secure.

At no point did I say I backed the para's doing this sort of action. But it does appear to be a whole lot more effective than what the courts do. There are several documented events of joyriders being kneecapped or worse after several convictions of car theft / joyriding. Yet they are still on the street. Why is that? In a lot of cases where they have career criminals if justice was actually be correctly served by the courts and decent sentences handed out on repeat offenders they would not be on the street to commit these crimes in the first place.

I too have been involved in incidents on the street. I typically tend to avoid them at all cost. I really do not like any kind of violence. Though sometimes it works. I was with a friend when attacked with multiple people. First they tried to pretend to sell us drugs. Then they tried to take money from us (this was in a for-court of a well lit garage). However we didn't role over. We actually badly injured several of the group who were attempting to attack us. There was good quality cctv footage and multiple eye witness reports given to the police. Yet still nothing came of it.

Or another incident where a friend of mine was working in a garage somebody came in pointed a gun at his head and took the contents of the cash draw. Was identified / convicted and sentenced to several years. Was back on the street's again less than one year later. It wasn't his first and from what I have seen was not his last ...

So our justice system does not work. this is the key root of the problem. When this happens people will always stand up and protect themselves. Or take matters into their own hands. I don't support it. But unless the ""state"" does something to fix it. It will always happen.

You should also be given the right to defend your self in your own home (or place of residence) against any complete stranger. Since when somebody entering your home you do not know if they are coming to rob / rape / kill / torture. Instead our society lets it happen. So it keeps happening. Seriously though if you were a career bugler and had a 1 in 10 chance of being hurt / injured / killed every time you entered somebody else home the situation would resolve its self quite quickly.

true,Noodlehands,null,null,"Generally disagree with all your statements on taxation, but as the issue is specifically Health care provision imma going to focus on that.

&gt;Privatising healthcare is a step towards a more voluntary, rights respecting society. Competition between private companies is widely acknowledged as being the best motivator for driving efficiency and reducing operational costs. Just removing the overhead of tax collection and centralisation from UK healthcare would dramatically increase the value for money that patients get, let alone considering how competition would reform practices.

Markets can work in many areas, but what is the actual evidence for this working in Health care? What about the risks of total privatisation, e.g., monopolies, lack of accountability (think of the recent PIP implants scandal), lack of access to high risk and expensive procedures, provider selectivity, etcetera. 

The private sector isn't obligated to have a round the clock, every day emergency service, nor do they have to provide anything at all. A private hospital could decide to close up one day and not have to bear any consequence.

This outlines some further risks that will likely arise in the very near future

true,RedsFan7,lfc99,null,"In my eyes today's 2 biggest issues were tactics and the midfield.

I'll start with tactics, to me it seemed that we played the long ball the entire first half, this works (sometimes?) when we have Andy in, but we had no height up front and just kept losing the ball. Then when Andy did come in we didn't play the long ball as much, and I'm not sure why but until Downing came on Andy kept showing up on the wing.

Our midfield also got overrun this game. I don't know if it was a lack of pace or if we were just off today but we couldn't manage anything in the midfield but back passes.

Some may disagree but I think Downing is our most in-form player right now, and he didn't even start - I have an issue with this. I think Kenny is a wonderful motivator and definitely helped the club last season but I find myself questioning his lineups more and more. And for me subs should've been at halftime, not in the 70th minute - this is my biggest issue with Kenny, I know he wants to give the players a chance but subs have to have time to do something, he ALWAYS uses subs too late.

I have little trust in our side keeping clean sheets without Lucas/Agger, and unless we start scoring we will have more results like today.

That's a massive but. 

If you are condemning joyriders, street fighters and car thieves but not condemning people who run most of the drugs in this province, most of the prostitution in this province and for a nice wee sideline, intimidate and brutalise whole communities throughout the province, then to be honest I don't really want to hear your views on social justice. Your position appears to be that GBH, attempted murder and intimidation aren't crimes if they are perpetrated on scumbags or criminals. 

 I agree our criminal justice system isn't perfect, but I would say that the major problems aren't carjackings, muggings and street fights, I would say whole communities living in fear, whole areas of our country controlled by criminal gangs dispensing their own brand of justice is a big fucking problem. And the more people like you say, 'I don't like them, but...' the bigger and bigger the problem is going to get.

You seem to be confusing paramilitaries with normal people. You say 'people will stand up and protect themselves...or take matters into their own hands.' This is exactly the bullshit rhetoric that the paramilitaries want you to believe, that they are community workers keeping their communities safe and drug free. It was bullshit in 1969 and it's still bullshit now. People who shoot 16 year olds through the knees are not standing up and protecting themselves, they are reinforcing their power over the community by inflicting pain and suffering on some of the weakest members, the children. It is abhorrent and evil, wise up. 

You didn't say 'the right to defend your self in your own home' at first. I agree with that, and you do not need to be 'given' this right; you already have it in your own home and everywhere else. You said 'the right to kill/shoot/or do anything you want (in your own home)' which is what I whole heartedly disagree with.

 So how do teams that are underperforming get out of these slumps? Leadership. It really is that simple. Whether it comes from the manager, the captain, or senior players, this team needs to believe they **can** win.

Queens Gardens are a nice place to eat your lunch.

Because Hull is quite a poor city, its very cheap to live and shop there. Poor doesn't mean its utterly shit though. For example, there's The Deep which is one of the worlds leading aquariums.

Internet is shit though. Kingston Communications have a monopoly there and their ISP is Karoo. If you google Karoo you'll find out all you need to know. 

If you rent a car, head north and you're into my county. 10 minutes out of Hull and you're in open countryside with some of the best driving roads in the UK. Head 28 miles to the coast at Bridlington and there's some impressive beaches, Bempton Cliffs and the bird sanctuary there.

The group, in reality, has quite a lot of out and out racist members who find the BNP too politically inconvenient. Not all of them are, but there's a significant minority.

This show was very good:

You can see that the EDL are basically a reactionary movement to counter the presence of extremist Muslims. I empathise. Muslims are allowed to protest everything about Britain and freedom of speech itself, and say some very nasty things, but if some white guys said such extreme stuff, they'd be in trouble with the law. You can really understand where they're coming from when the government has an asymmetric policy.

Here's another interesting link:

In the case of Henderson and Carroll, it's undeniable that they have actually done *worse* under Liverpool than they did with their previous clubs. How is that hopeful improvement? That should be troubling.

Your example of Man City is a somewhat appropriate one, but it fails in that Man City improved every season. After 120 million pounds of investment, we have not made any significant, tangible improvement apart from the hopeful ideal that we are progressing. We need more than the **feeling** that we are getting better.

I agree that change takes time, but I am no longer as confident that we are growing at the rate that should be expected of the financial outlay and quality of these players. 

The primary goal of this club at the beginning of the season was to qualify for Champion's League football. It was said by the senior players, it was said by the manager, and it was said by the owners (go back and read their statements from June-August). It was never, ""Let's hope that Henderson, Carroll and Coates get better, we win the Milk Cup and in a few years we will be great.""

That wasn't the point I was making at all! Christ I never make arguments from tradition! Perish the thought, I don't know how I gave that impression. My point was rather it was that the system we have now was not arrived at suddenly and without prior foundation. Obviously the taxation systems in place where serfs would give up portions of their land's produce to the Earl/Lord/Land owner/Church was not particularly wholesome, but it was (among several other things) how we arrive to where we are today. You were making the point ""Should someone take my money?"" as though it was a system that is obviously unjust and without precedent.

Your argument seemed to be ""Taxation is theft of my property/money against my will."" while I still think that's a rather simplified view of the matter. Can I ask your opinion on whether or not you think the initial idea for the NHS was a good thing, and whether or not you agree with those politicians that set the system up?

I'm not sure that picking and choosing which sections of government taxation should fund is realistic, in so far as the general public is not informed enough to understand how much things cost or how things work. I am *not* saying ""They need to be looked after, poor things"" but simply that it is impossible for any one person to understand the ridiculously complex systems we operate today, or even in the recent past.

Wishing to opt out of various areas like 'defence' (no, I don't consider Iraq or Afghanistan defence) - that, perhaps, I can agree with assuming that the budget can be split into ""overseas"" and ""border"" defence. I'm not sure what else could practically be distinguished. If someone didn't want to fund the road infrastructure, could they then legitimately be stopped from using the public highway?

Your solution (private companies etc.) sounds reasonable, but in practice we know that it can cause issues. While competition between private firms initially will lower prices, what occurs when one company wins out? For some reason I have Walmart in my head. Milk is a prime example of what I'm describing, and I'm rather surprised you brought it up: supermarkets have been able to cut prices to an extent where [some dairy farmers make losses on every pint](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/farming/7805740/Countryside-in-Crisis-how-dairy-farmers-are-milked-dry.html). There's a reason we've lost so many (dairy) farmers in the UK. Of course the supermarkets are free to do as they wish, and the farmers can sell the milk elsewhere or sell up...

But it's not just milk. [I recall hearing about supermarkets setting up buy one get one free offers, with the producer picking up the tab.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/02/british-farmers-supermarket-price-wars) Link from last summer, but I believe I heard about it years ago.

We used to bang on about Benitez waiting until the hour to make changes, now Kenny drags it out to the 70th minute! By the time the player is up to speed there's less than 15 mins left!

Adam is shit. Let's not beat around the bush here. When Liverpool were courting him halfway through last season the only people not laughing at us were Liverpool and Blackpool fans. He's just not good enough. No forward vision, he passes constantly sideways and backwards, thinks he can shoot when he clearly can't and is a liability in the tackle. I was watching him closely against arsenal and if the ball come to him on a counter attack he would break it up. He needs to go.

I am probably not explaining some of my views / points very well as you seem to be understanding them differently from what I mean. That would be the nature of the English language! OR any language :)

I by no means support the drug dealers and people who do these sort's of things. However if you stop for a moment and consider the situation of certain places if some of these persistent criminals are permitted to continue. In certain area's the quality of life becomes even more reduced.

In a way the scrum and career criminals in this sort of situation is self policing since they tend to kill each other. In almost all cases they know exactly what they are getting involved in and the risk's involved. After all it is their choice to choose this path in life. This happens in all counties we seem to call them para's other tend to call them the mob / mafia or other criminal groups. I don't actually think the situation in n.ireland is really as bad as it is in other area's eg in england / us and other countries. Mostly because we have a smaller population.

When you talk about people who are 16 and being shot in the knee's. Yup this sucks. But yes they are often completely aware of the risk's. I know somebody who was in this sort of positions and he did choose to leave a life of crime (dealing) and wasn't punished in a vigilantly style.

You have to remember that at 16 people can leave school. Their basic education is meant to be finished. Although still not considered an adult. They have already be educated to the best of the ability of the education system to be an ""adult"". So yes our failing education system also plays a massive role in the creation of this sort of problem :)

Something I do typically consider bullshit in this country is how people view the ""groups / para's"". People still seem to see them as some religious group connected with the troubles. Where as it may still be the same people involved it has almost dissolved to the point where it is simply organised crime. Just like most other countries involving gangs like the mod / mafia / etc.... People who had a political agenda in the group have now either moved to the back or moved into politics :)

So no I don't really buy into this bullshit :) Its not where I get my views from

Not sure who is down voting you. You do raise fair and good points and its not me that is down voting you!

There are many users on reddit who think that this is what the upvotes / downvotes are for agree/disagree on a post. They are for relevance of the conversation / debate.

Controversial posts should normally be upvoted. The more people that hear other people views with some understanding behind them tend to think better about their own views and also be able to challenge their own views. This makes people individuals instead of a lemming.

So stop down voting this guy :)

Or at least give a good fecking reason!

Since Watson is a doctor and Sherlock knows he is not easily fooled when it comes to the medical status of people, Sherlock asks someone to violently bump into Watson on a bicycle. (Remember that Sherlock at one point says he finds out a lot of things through his homeless people network, and perhaps the guy on the bike is someone that helps him for a reward). That way Sherlock has more time to fake his death and Watson will be confused and disoriented from his fall. Sherlock probably uses a trick to fake the lack of his pulse, or to at least make it barely noticeable. This can be done by for instance sticking an object that fits nicely in your armpit and then squeezing it tight. The obstructed blood flow stop the blood flow in your arm and it will entirely or nearly completely make the pulse beat stop. Since this is a simple trick and the pulse may still be a bit noticeable, this gave Sherlock a reason to let someone bump into Watson. Also the fact that squeezing an object under your armpit makes the muscles suspiciously tense gives another reason to make sure Watson is disoriented and confused.

Earlier in the story he asked Molly for help, and she is the only one in on the trick. She later helps Sherlock by confirming it is him and that he is death.

Also, take note that he is standing on a building with the word ""Pathology"" written on it. Since he is apparently death, there is no need to bring him to the hospital, and Molly intervenes quickly to complete the trick, so no one else will check upon Sherlock and his true physical state.

Oh, and the reason that there is guy bumping into Watson at that specific time, is because he simply used his cellphone to call and arrange the collision.",0,1331428515,null,0,false,0,c3zqego,t3_qqrv8,t1_c3zqego,t1_c3zp2mg,null,1428502958,10,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,10

We barely won against a bottom half team that played most of the match with 10 men.  Embarrassing is the only adjective can describe Chelsea today - the quality was totally absent (the exception being our free kicks, which were very threatening).  We struggled for 40 minutes to get a goal against 10 men, and when we finally did, we preferred to become complacent, turning the ball over to Stoke so much that they came close to burying an equalizer.  Cahill and Lampard should be commended for their fantastic performances, but the rest of the squad played without any sense of rhythm or connectivity.

It isn't going to be easy, but it won't be easy for the Arse or for Chelsea.  We were flying high with a 10 point gap because we thought over the course of a year we'd completely eclipsed them.  Truth is we haven't, but we are at least their equals, and we've got the rest of the season to show we can be their betters.

10 games left.  Only one against a ""big"" club.  We have a one point grasp on third place, and we're in with a shout for the FA Cup.  How many of you don't take that deal, if offered at the start of the season?

He can't save a loved one, he can't save a planet, race, etc. Especially since they tried killing of the Doctor in S6, and then wiggled their way out of it in the last episode. Doing it in back to back seasons would be boring.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans along. We've had approximately 780 episodes but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in anywhere. The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. 

We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a person will like.

Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 then relaunched in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1331442861,null,0,false,0,c3zsdje,t3_qr6ju,t1_c3zsdje,t3_qr6ju,null,1428503893,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,daveduckman,null,null,"You say I am ""sick of all this negativity"" but then you pretty well articulate everything that's wrong with the club at the moment; we are playing bad football, we don't have a squad which has gelled or has tactical consistency, and we have made little if no progress over the past 2 years.

The negativity is that we deserve to be 7th. It's not that we deserve to be 4th and are unlucky, we really do deserve to be 7th for our inability to win the games we should and play like we did in the last 5 minutes of the sunderland game on a regular basis.

The negativity is because this is Liverpool, this is a team that has thrived on hard-working impassioned players who pass and move, and we do none of those things at the moment.

The negativity is the frustration of how far we've fallen since 2008 when we were truly unlucky and deserved to be premiers. 

The negativity is for the lost potential of this generation of the team, particularly for stevie and jamie, and for dirk and reina and lucas and agger and all those players who really should be the cogs of a premiership team. Who really should be in the quarters and the semis of the Champions Cup every year. 

The negativity is because we should expect more from our team. When we were great, it's because we expected to win trophies, to win titles and back them up with European cups and win the FA cup just for fun. And even when we weren't so great, we still went into every top 4 clash expecting to win and every european tie and expected to win. And that's why we beat Ronaldinho's Barca and trounced Real Madrid and that's why we remember Istanbul.

The negativity comes from ambition and frustration. Frustration of the fans who go to Anfield week in week out without even seeing a win, or travel to Bolton or Sunderland  or Braga and come away with a performance that wasn't up to the red shirt. Frustration of the fans who stay up late at night or wake up early every morning to watch their club fail to put away their chances or show the spirit of Istanbul. Frustration of every fan across the world who really have little to say to the taunts and jibes of Man Utd fans, or City fans, or Chelsea fans, or Gunner fans or Tottenham fans.

The negativity stems from the ambition of everyone at the club and everyone supporting the club, who knows that the only way we will ever be great again; the only way we can Premier League number 19, the only way we can call Wembley Anfield South again, the only way we can parade through the city with a champions cup again, is if we set out ambitions at that height.

In short, the negativity is neccessary, because negativity stems from our ambition, and ambition will make us great.",0,1331444246,null,0,true,0,c3zsk27,t3_qr30v,t1_c3zsk27,t3_qr30v,null,1428503976,34,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,34

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"Absolutely. There is some negativity that is stupid (""Carroll and Henderson are bad hurrr/FIRE KENNY RIGHT NOW/No one cares let's play all the reserves instead), but being legitimately upset and disappointed every week is something to be negative about. Yeah, we have the Carling Cup and that is cool. Winning the FA Cup would be great as well. I'm American and I woke up at 6:30 on a Saturday to watch today's game, only to find out it wasn't on TV. I then spent 20 minutes scouring the internet for the best stream I could find, with the best announcing and the best quality. I thought ""Cattermole and Sessegnon are suspended, Kieran Richardson is out on injury. That really only leaves Larsson as their top-class players, so we should do okay.""

Then I saw the lineup. Carroll on the bench again? Downing on the bench? I'm sure we all know they haven't been the best all season, but they've both been in-form recently. Gerrard not starting, Johnson not even on the bench? Okay... Never seen Coates play but I'll give him a shot, Carragher has seemed tired recently. Spearing and Adam in the center? I don't really care for either of them, but I trust it'll work out.

It didn't work out. I stopped paying attention at the 80th minute, started browsing Reddit and listening to the stream in the background. It's hard to get excited about Liverpool games now. Today's game was garbage. It was boring to watch and completely unacceptable. If we'd won today and win against Everton, we'd have a good chance of passing Newcastle for sixth and putting some pressure on Chelsea for fifth. We had that opportunity and we choked.

Newcastle fans are probably thrilled to be in sixth, given that they were promoted back to the PL only last year (or two years ago, I don't remember). Sunderland and Everton are content with 8 and 9. Wigan is getting RELEGATED and they seem to mostly have accepted that fact. That is not how we do things at Liverpool. We are not okay with 7th. If it's the best we can do, fine. If this year needs to be a transitional year, so the guys can figure out how to play together, fine. If Kenny has to admit that he made some mistakes and fix them by bringing in new players, fine. I am not okay with us finishing in 7th, but I will accept that it may happen.

What I WON'T accept is the idea that this is now Liverpool's place in the Premier League. I will not accept that we should get 5th every four or five seasons and spend the rest of our seasons hovering around 7-8. We should be a top 4 team, or at least a team with a chance of contending, every year. Yeah, this year has been hard. Arsenal made a comeback no one expected. Man City stepped everything way up. Tottenham is having one of the best seasons it's ever had. Newcastle has been consistently good. Despite everything, Chelsea hasn't imploded like we hoped. It's a hard season, but we're not in 7th because we're losing against Manchester clubs. We're in 7th because we can't even scrape a point out of Arsenal at Anfield. We're in 7th because we let Bolton kick our ass. We're in 7th because we look at a mid table team missing 3 of their best players, like Sunderland was, and think ""eh, we don't really need a midfield, right?""

I am not going to bitch about Carroll or Downing or even Adam (most of the time). I'm not going to say that Henderson is worthless. I'm not going to say that Kenny should be fired or that he's not fixing our problems. This is not the fault of any one player or manager, or even a handful. This is a problem with the team and I am really disappointed by it, but that disappointment is because I believe in LFC and I want them to succeed, not because I am a ""fairweather fan"" or have turned on the club.",0,1331446050,null,0,false,0,c3zsse6,t3_qr30v,t1_c3zsse6,t1_c3zsk27,null,1428504086,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10
