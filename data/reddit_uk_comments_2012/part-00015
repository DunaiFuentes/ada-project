true,Sleww,lfc68,,"**Steven Gerrard**

Unfortunately, we haven’t seen much of the captain in this campaign. Instead, he’s had to sit out with multiple injuries. Hopefully, his injury problems are over and he can get back to leading us into the top four. He’s played well since his return, for the most part. In the games he hasn’t played well, it was not due to lack of effort by him, but rather a weak game plan by Kenny. If you have someone like Steven Gerrard, use him to the fullest. By that I mean, use him at the position he is meant to play. When Gerrard plays as the lone attacking midfielder behind Carroll and whoever else is up front, he has amazing games. When he’s placed further back in the midfield, though, he has a weak game in which he does not do much. Instead, he wastes most of his energy making tackles and trying to get possession back. When he plays up front, though, we seem to have possession in the final third much more than when he doesn’t. Gerrard is a creative player by nature. Against Spurs, he was the creator of most of the attacking plays. If he cannot be played in the attacking midfield role, it may be better not to play him at all. Although he can play any role in the team well, he needs to be kept fresh to lead the team and running around trying to make tackles is not the way to do it.


**Jordan Henderson**

For some reason, this subreddit seems to have an overall negative look on Henderson. Henderson, in my opinion, has been the most consistent as well as strongest player in our midfield. His start at Liverpool was not very strong, but that is mainly because he is playing out of position! People don’t realize that Henderson is an attacking midfielder by nature, rather than a right mid or right winger. Over the season, Henderson has improved his game immensely. He is a great crosser, he is great on the ball, he even seems to like having the ball at his feet, and his creative mind is one of the best we have. Henderson has made himself into a player I would hate playing against, and he’s only 21! If Kenny and Liverpool management are not planning on building their future team around Jordan Henderson, they are making a huge mistake. Henderson has the capability to become a Liverpool legend at or above the level of Gerrard. He seems to already be better than Gerrard at tackling. Like I said, he is playing out of position. When Stevie is begin rested, Henderson needs to be tried out at attacking midfielder. That said, he has done a great job in learning his hopefully temporary position.

P.S. Why isn’t he in the discussion for the English national team?


**Jonjo Shelvey**

Shelvey has shown to be a strong young attacking midfielder. Unfortunately for him, we seem to be set at that position for now. Hopefully, he can come off the bench to replace Gerrard and Hnederson and he can get his playing time that way. He and Henderson really are the Liverpool players of the future. Luckily for him, he’s still quite young and has many opportunities to make his mark.


**Craig Bellamy**

Bellamy has been electric for us in this campaign. With Suarez gone, it was looking tough for us in terms of goal scoring. Bellamy really stepped his game up when we needed him most. He’s a tough man for defenders to deal with because of his pace around the pitch as well as his tenacity. Unfortunately, he hardly gets to play a full ninety minutes due to his bad knees. Hopefully, he won’t leave after this season like usually does and we get to see him annoy defenders for a couple years to come.


**Maxi Rodriguez**

Maxi is a mystery. He really likes scoring at Stamford Bridge, where he always seems to be in the right place at the right time. Everywhere else, though, he seems to be a mixture of bad passes, bad crosses, and bad decisions. It will surprise me if he is not sold during the summer transfer window. I’m really not sure what else to say about him.


**Dirk Kuyt**

Kuyt is another mystery. He was a hero for us after the FA Cup win over United and he even scored at Wolves, but his touches against Spurs were some of the worst touches I’ve seen him make in his career. He hasn’t gotten that much playing time so that will affect his confidence, and we know that he will constantly be running, especially to help us out of defense. While he’s been great for us over the years, I think it may be time for him to leave and make way for younger talent.


**Luis Suarez**

Suarez has been fantastic on the pitch. The problem is that he just can’t seem to stay out of the headlines. It is not always his fault, but the English media seem to be hell-bent on hating him. If he even steps with the wrong foot, the media seem to be all over him. Despite that, he was a Ballon d’Or nominee. His creativity and dribbling ability in the final third is unmatched by anyone in the EPL, besides for maybe David Silva. He sees openings in the defense that don’t seem to exist and he tries to exploit them as best he can. Hopefully, the nine match ban hasn’t hurt his form too much and he will get back to scoring goals for us in no time. What I am worried about is that he will be booed at nearly every match we go to. If this gets to his head, he may look to get out of England as quickly as possible, and I wouldn’t blame him. I’m sure teams like Real Madrid and AC Milan will definitely make bids for him.


**Andy Carroll**

Despite all the criticism thrown at Carroll, I think he’s played well. He’s had a dull season truthfully but he seems to recently have found a renewed passion for the game and a new fire to score goals. His confidence still isn’t there yet and he wastes some good opportunities, but it should come with time. It was actually a good moment when he told Spearing to fuck off against Spurs, it showed that he actually wanted it. For the first half to the season, it seemed like he didn’t even know why he was on the pitch. Hopefully, he can regain his confidence soon because we have invested way too much into him for him to go on without goals.

There’s one more thing I’d like to bring up. Torres is struggling mightily at Chelsea. We all know he’s a good player. No one doubts his skill, yet he couldn’t buy a goal if he tried. A thought occurred to me the other day. Torres seems to be struggling from the same affliction that affects Messi. Just as Messi cannot score without Xavi and Iniesta, Torres cannot score without Gerrard and Xabi Alonso. In truth, I would love to have Xabi Alonso and Torres back with us. While Torres may have betrayed us a bit, he will always be a legend at Liverpool and we cannot let him walk alone. Xabi Alonso would be welcome back here by everyone that loves Liverpool. He was great for us, and would continue to be great for us I’m sure.

This went a lot longer than I had planned. Sorry for that.

**TL; DR You’ll Never Walk Alone.**

Personally my favorite of the new series is 11 but that doesn't mean I think 10 was bad or ""worse"", I just prefer 11's personality to 10 and I'm sure that 12 will be just as different.

true,refcon,null,null,"This has dramatically reduced the return on government debt as much of the quantitative easing ends up invested in UK Gilts. This has both lowered the cost of borrowing fro the UK government and made it easier for British banks to increase their capitalisation. This has promoted stability within the UK banking sector, reducing risk whilst at the same time reducing the required fiscal contraction had borrowing costs been higher.  

There are however negative effects. We have seen a significant uptick in recent levels of inflation due to the expansive monetary policy, both from the increase in the monetary base the and fall in the value of the £ (due in part to the inflation in the UK). 

The fall in the return on government debt (Gilts) has also had another significant effect on the economy which is not often appreciated. Gilts are used by financial institutions as a 'safe' investment, as the government is highly unlikely to default. This low risk means they have a low return - in order to provide higher returns financial institutions invest in riskier assets to provide the return on equity needed to attract investment. As Gilt rates have fallen financial institutions have therefore been required to make riskier investments in order to increase the average return (as it had fallen as the return on Gilts fell). 

Financial institutions that are prevented from making riskier investments have simply seen their return on equity fall. These institutions are mainly insurance companies and pension funds. This has led to a significant decrease in annuities, leading to a fall in pension income. As long as QE continues pension income will stay depressed.

* There is no mention of why the connection in drawn, correlation is not causation.

* The conclusion drawn is cherry picked from the one study that, by pure coincidence, happens to have data that fits exactly into the political bias the DM is widely known to have.

Here is me checking the reference material available from Eurostat, as mentioned in the article. http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-12-009/EN/KS-SF-12-009-EN.PDF :

* Oh look, the report draws none of the conclusions that the DM is drawing. How brilliant of them to be able to look at graphs and tables and *draw conclusions that the highly experienced and trained statisticians did not*

* The DM have drawn conclusions that the collected data doesn't test for. You can't do this, you design a model to fit your data, you don't engineer data to fit a model.

* The figures are from 2010 and do not actually show us what the figures are now, the Euro zone could be much much worse off.

* According to these figures we have a worse ""At risk of poverty"" score for people in every category than France, Germany, Denmark, Sweeden...

* About 25% of UK people in the sample had the inability to face ""unexpected financial expenses"".

* The report, no-where, mentions benefits or welfare.

* Households ""work intensity"" is much lower than in other countries, this is not necessarily the same as unemployment though the two will probably correlate.

First, I have some student debt denominated in another [currency](http://i.imgur.com/hZLvf.png) and my girlfriend sends money overseas every month to help her mother pay for medicine and heating bills. We're both being squeezed as the pound is losing value rapidly. Using round numbers, if payments were £1000 pre-crisis it is now £1320. Ouch.

Second, it feels disingenious that the Bank of England talks about the QE program as necessary to hit a medium term 2% inflation target while inflation is running at 5%. As a saver, this is hitting me hard and as a wage-earner my take-home pay is being rapidly eroded. It may make life easier for British exporters, but it isn't much fun for the rest of us. 

Cutting salaries and benefits by 10-15% could lead to riots while using QE-driven inflation for a couple of years achieves the same effect but much more gradually, with blame being directed to energy companies or other sectors that have to pay much higher prices for imported commodities instead of being focused on the government.

I know the deflationary spiral argument, but from where I'm sitting the only thing I see is inflation. Also, having been to Japan and seen the quality of their infrastructure, the vibrant economy and the living standard they enjoy I have to say that if decades of deflation does that to a country, then I'd prefer deflation over inflation. 

Third, the increase in gilts. A gilt is a UK Government liability issued by the Treasury and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Every six months this pays out a coupon and then on maturity date the holder receives the final coupon payment and the return of the principal. This [chart](http://i.imgur.com/9pHTr.png) shows what has happened since the crisis. Note that much is held by 'non-residents', likely Chinese and UAE soverign wealth funds. That is half a trillion pounds worth of gilts which we have to pay out coupons on and for which the principal eventually needs to be re-paid.

true,geekchic,null,null,"This is a fallacy that there is a way for the bulk of consumers to collectively lower their prices.

Let us presume that the industry needs X income per year.

It has a number of customers, the bulk of whom will pay the average price, and a small minority of whom will be price-hoppers seeking the lowest possible prices.

The industry knows this, and set prices accordingly to ensure that across its customer base, it retains X income per year.

Now, if all customers switched to the lowest tariff - what happens?

Why, the industry now has less than X coming in - so it just puts up the per unit prices to reach X again.

Mass participation movements like this don't lower prices for the majority. What they do is end low prices for the minority of price-hopping consumers, and raises the average rate for everyone else.

by turning right, donna's life turned to complete shit. her mother's losing her mind, all their friends are dead. the entire planet is circling the drain and there is absolutely no hope for anyone, because there is no doctor to save them.

donna makes the decision to sacrifice herself because she has nothing to stick around for. that's why she rejects rose the first couple of times, because she doesn't believe her. it's only when she realises that the stars are going out, and everything rose told her must be true- that the entire security of the planet rests on her turning left all those years ago- that she realises that she stands to lose nothing but pain and misery by going back, but gain everything, for herself, for her loved ones and for everyone else.

**donna agreed to go back, because the alternative was oblivion**

old amy spent her entire adult life (in tgww) on her own, forced to adapt and rely on herself. she was FORCED to become a better, more rounded and capable individual. 

she had no bitterness towards her younger self. she just recognised that they didn't have anything in common anymore, except their love for rory. all she wanted was to go off and live somewhere else. she didn't have to go with them, just be allowed to not live in complete isolation, constantly watching her own back.

if someone offered to go back in time to when you were a child and make it so that you were raised with the absolute best of everything- best care, education, opportunities, etc- but you as you are now (with all your experiences, thoughts, personality, ambitions) will be erased from existence- would **you** take that deal? would you *leap* at the opportunity?

just because sacrificing herself so that she never has to endure 40 years of suffering isn't all there is to consider. she may have found that despite her hardship, she likes who she has become- tougher, brilliant, capable- and isn't willing to throw all that away. she's the living embodiment of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. you tend to value what you achieve through adversity more highly than that which comes easily.

I really like the show and I like the fact it's live and unpolished; that gives it more of a natural feel. Who cares that they stutter occasionally? Real people do! On the whole, I think they all do a remarkably good job of delivering their set speeches. 

But the thing I disagree with you about most strongly, TheJizzard, is David Mitchell's interviews: I think they're brilliant! He's very sharp witted and articulates opposing viewpoints as well as any regular presenter/interviewer – with the added bonus that, being a comedian, he can get away with saying lots of things they couldn't. Take last night's for example: he clearly doesn't like football – which I love, BTW – so he makes several ridiculous sweeping insults that would normally have set the grumpy Alistair Campbell off in a tantrum, but instead he just laughs at him. To me, that's the point of interviews like this: it's not to conduct a hard-hitting Paxmanesque wind-up, it's to disarm the guests with comedic banter while *still* managing to get across some serious points if possible. Jon Stewart quality he may not be yet, but I honestly think he's got the potential to be as good.

I personally could do without Jimmy Carr's parody sketches, but I've talked to other people who think they're great, so I guess it's a matter of there being a bit of something for everyone. I also think he's generally excellent in the round table group discussions; often showing an astute understanding of a given topic or otherwise adding a dry witty – or trademark uncomfortably sick – comment here and there.

You're lucky that the current administration is sympathetic though, the repeal of DADT and not heavily enforcing DOMA is a good positive step. While I can understand it's not quite enough, marriage rights will be determined by the SCOTUS or Americans might go 'full retard' and vote Republicans back in which will scupper the movement.

Plus, we've had plenty of pro-gay leaders in the past and Cameron isn't a great example of one if you look at his voting record historically.

I'm not trying to convince you to live in Albion, it's not for everyone, but it is the cheapest accommodation that isn't on/near Jubilee/Raleigh Park.  Only £83 a week, and you get a basin in your room. (Next year that's going up to £91 a week)

Honestly, being in catered or self-catered is really up to you. You'll have an epic time either way. I like being in Albion, which is self-catered because it's in Beeston, which has loads of shops and pubs and it's also where both of the main supermarkets are (Sainsbury's and Tesco Extra, with a Lidl not too far away either). I can see Sainsbury's from my bedroom window.

Broadgate has a range of rooms for a variety of prices, but having looked at the prices for next year, it seems to have gone up!

EXACTLY!  

You didn't know what you were doing, you don't know the civil obligations and you took part in an illegal protest that endangered a lot of people.

If you want to organise a march or static protest in the UK, you're absolutely entitled too, but you have a legal obligation to fill out form 3175 under Section 133 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.  The legal protest did this and it passed by peaceful with hundreds of thousands attending and all returning home safely and in a timely manner.

Some, a minority, decided to break from it, from the planned route, and take the protest elsewhere which is an illegal act.

And where in the video are the police forming a line, around Charing Cross with their backs to the direction of Parliament i.e. the designated area for sections 132 to 137 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.

There was a massive lawful and peaceful protest, properly organised, well attended that went through all the processes to make sure it was safe and above board - and the headlines the next day were stolen by the selfish, inconsiderate and frankly naive people such as yourself watching those that had arrived with the purpose to light a fire, throw some fireworks, wear a mask and attack the police - and you with your attendance cheered them on and made matters worse.  The police had to be present to make sure it didn't move one step across the road into the designated area, and when fires were lit, fireworks and fences thrown it was a criminal act - and you stood and watched it and made the situation worse.

And here you are saying you didn't know.  Not knowing isn't an excuse.

*Blush* Why thank you kind Sir! I am 36... but I don't look a day over 50! I also have a 6 yr old boy, which lives things up somewhat! Depending on whose room I am in, I never know if I will tread on a discarded make-up item, a dried up crust of something which was once edible 3 months ago, or a thomas the tank engine toy! 

&gt;I totally agree with your points. I only wish all parents were as close to their teenage children as you are. I can't help thinking that if a young woman considers herself adult enough to be having sex and taking the pill, then she should also consider herself adult enough to be able to discuss it with her parent(s) who, after all, are still legally responsible for their welfare. However, I realise that we don't live in an ideal world and it doesn't always happen that way.

Indeed. Although I am not sure much consideration into whether they are mature enough goes on, it is more hormones and drive, which is why  so many girls find themselves pregnant. There is something in the brain which doesn't quite engage on an adult level, they understand the concepts but putting it into practise and realising that it might happen to them doesn't seem to register. All you can do is arm them with information and hope they make the right choices. 

&gt;t's time like this that I'm grateful that I have 2 boys. That said, the elder one turns 13 in a few months and I am scared. He's already showing signs of arm-flailing Kevinism.

Oh yeah I know that one! My daughter is 17 and my son is 15, the delights of grunting to me first thing in the morning! Mind you I don't do much more in the way of communication myself until I have had a coffee.

The Liverpool match was his first really decent performance in months, and it still wasn't up to the standard he was setting back in September.

One of the big reasons I was so keen for us to sign Parker rather than the touted alternatives (Diarra, etc) was because he seemed less likely to restrict Sandro's opportunities. I know Sandro has spent a fair amount of time injured, but when fit he should be playing more alongside Modric, with Parker sometimes dropping to the bench - we lose a lot of creativity when we play Parker and Sandro in the centre, and Sandro has consistently outshone Parker whenever they've got on the pitch together this season.

Charlie is great in the right context, but poor in others.  In 10 O'clock live, he's not *bad* per se he's just at his most unoriginal.  He's basically doing Newswipe *Lite*, but with added audience laughter and sensationalism.  Personally, I think he's at his best when he hasn't got a live audience.

Especially your KK point, some reason he is bulletproof to most fans, and any criticism you send his way immediately gets shot down, especially by fair weather supports, who are 10 a penny when you live in Liverpool.

The comment on Charlie Adam not being a defensive midfielder, but being an attacking one, as in my opinion he was even worse when he played the CAM role, he was slow, wasteful, and most of all always picked the wrong pass (whether its due to eagerness to please, or him only having the ability to see the killer ball, yet not hitting it 9/10)


Another point that didn't quite settle with me is Downing. Yes, I know a lot of people are on his back, and it can't be good for his confidence, but I could take his lack of goals, and assists on the chin, if he atleast tried to beat a man, he seems incapable of it, he gets to about half way into the opponents half, then passes backwards, he is the biggest shit house I have ever seen when it comes to getting past a defender.


Final tiny point, with Suarez, yes he has amazing craft, he is exciting, and probably our most technically gifted player, but this just makes it even more frustrating when he can't finish to save his life. He seems to have an affliction, if the goal isn't amazingly difficult to score he misses it.


 But, booing isn't new to Suarez game, I think he gets off on the role as Pantomine villian, with biting the opposition, his handball off the line against Ghana, Evra Racism row, and the cherry on the cake, his diving, have all went toward cementing him a place in the love to hate hall of fame, with such alumni as Roy Keane, ElHadji Diouf, Didier Drogba, and Christiano Ronaldo.",0,1328798835,null,0,false,0,c3pgg9t,t3_phgin,t1_c3pgg9t,t3_phgin,null,1428323052,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,bjan09,lfc68,,"There is quite a lot I disagree with here, but that is the normal course of football discussion, so I don't want to shoot you down point by point. There are a few of major points though:

1. Agree that Kenny must shoulder a great deal of blame for our failings against lesser sides. It doesn't require great management to get the team fired up for a game against Man Utd or another top team, where the manager earns his money is getting the best out of his players consistently. Given I think he is weak tactically, he really needs to compensate with man management. In many of your points you say the player is being played out of position (Adam, Henderson, Downing, Gerrard). This is without doubt the manager's fault and given he bought three of those players it is very odd that he should be then forced to play them out of position.

2. Henderson. I'm sorry but in no world will he be better than Steven Gerrard. Do you remember Gerrard aged 21? Do you remember Gerrard at 17? He was light years better than Henderson is at the moment. Everyone could see he was special, it was like Rooney, Messi, Ronaldo (fat). You contend that Henderson is a better tackler, I would urge you to consult Youtube. Henderson can be a good player and he seems to have a good attitude, but he is weak positionally and defensively. i agree that he should be playing centrally with less defensive responsibilities, but then we have Gerrard and Adam who you would also want in that role. Brings us back to transfer policy.

3. Maxi - he is just lazy, so lazy. I actually used to have a lot of time for him till I watched him in the Utd FA cup game. He either didn't care or is too unfit. Either way time for him to move on.

4. Kuyt is no mystery. He has the technique of a 10 year old. He has virtually zero intelligence on the pitch, compensating for this with stamina and effort. I don't deny that he has scored massive goals for us and his commitment is commendable. He is the kind of guy that you want on your side when the chips are up, but he is not a good player and now that we have tried to implement a quicker passing game, his lack of technique shows up even more. People say lack of game time, but I disagree, he is still playing daily in training so the first touch should be there. It just doesn't exist. 

My conclusion is that I am disappointed. I am disappointed by the league position obviously. But more than that I am disappointed in the lack of intelligence in the transfer market, the lack of guile up front, the fact that we can't beat teams at home. It just feels the same as it has for the last 15-20 years. We can look so good on our day but the lack of consistency means we will never be challengers.",0,1328799726,null,0,false,0,c3pgktp,t3_phgin,t1_c3pgktp,t1_c3pdrr4,null,1428323104,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

You are compassionate by not giving poor people money, you improve job prospects by decreasing wages, you improve general welfare by enabling rich people to become richer. These ideas are not necessarily wrong, but they are counter intuitive. Left wing comedians can exploit that gap in an amusing way. It's the single well timed comment which makes an entire elaborately constructed argument tumble down.

Hislop, as an example of a broadly conservative comedian, fits into this scheme, because what he does is to present the facts of a case in such a way as to cut through the complicated legal and bureaucratic justifications surrounding it, and expose it, deer-like in the headlamps, to common sense judgment.

I would also like to talk about Glen Johnson. If Glen Johnson wasn't a right-back, he wouldn't be played at right-back. How many times do you see him as the weak link in defense? When was the last time someone scored a goal because of Johnson? The only one I can remember this year was Fulham, but he had two guys to mark and did his best with what he could (and Reina gave away a rebound). 

Glen Johnson is a strong player. Obviously I like to see Kelly, but the right-back spot is Johnson's to lose at this point.

It was just pure opportunism.

I don't think that the youth of today are able to claim that ""they're getting their taxes back"" (as one of the rioter's has said). They haven't paid into the system yet, no-one's stolen their money. 

The real question is why there's so much youth unemployment. What conditions have the ""ruling elite"" created that is causing the youth unemployment? In my mind it seems to be that we've created an education system where we promote the freedom to choose what you want, but don't seem to instil any responsibility in choosing courses that leave you with a viable career path. Then of course there's the unskilled work that's often ""taken by immigrants"", but I think a lot of the young unemployed see those jobs as below them.

You see I thought last night's football interview was really good and his interjections were all very funny. When Campbell was listing the reasons he thought it was okay for he and Bertie Ahern to leave the NI peace talks early to watch football matches, he added: *""and neither of you particularly liked Northern Ireland!""* Funny. Saying Clarke Carlisle – who I thought spoke excellently BTW – was a role model, *""not for being a footballer, but for winning Countdown twice!""* was funny too. As was his defensive protestation that he wasn't responsible for the idea of footballers being role models. And right at the very end there, where he said, *""I don't think you're insane Alistair, I just wish you'd been a footballer!""* – implying he didn't like him as a spindoctor – was frankly hilarious.

true,AKneelingOx,null,null,"&gt; The alternative might have been oblivion, but she had no idea what would happen to her in the other timeline- for all she knew, Rose was manipulating her as a pawn and she'd be dead as a sacrifice to save everyone else or something.

so what? If the only options available to you are GUARANTEED destruction of *everything*, or taking a leap of faith and trusting some random girl who claims to be able to help, I know which door I’d open. What’s she got to lose?

Yes donna had no idea about the doctor or what she was letting herself in for by agreeing to go with rose, but once she saw rose wasn’t lying to her- when the stars were going out- it was hardly a gamble: bet your current hideous existence that will definitely only worsen until you die shortly, against the possibility of improving yours and everyone elses’?  

&gt; that doesn't make me like her more, because the Amy we've watched will never, ever achieve the “brilliance/capability/toughness"" of her alternative self, for the reasons you specified. She won't do it naturally, it's not part of her, she's a weak, constantly in distress character. Only when she's by herself did she become something, and only because survival depended on it. 

I’m not sure of what you’re trying to say here, as you appear to be reiterating my point- amy only gets good when she’s left to her own devices, which is something that the doctor and rory would never allow. My point was that it was sad to see all that potential that will never be realised, replaced with the pathetic flirt we’ve had so far.

&gt; Additionally, as a psychologist, I refuse to believe that's what Older Amy would have become- that degree of social isolation would have resulted in absolute insanity, not what we saw so I don't put a lot of weight on that, either. Nor do I put much weight in that Older Amy getting to leave and travel would have been good- she wouldn't have been able to handle it after so long alone.

you are aware you’re watching a drama series about an alien with a time machine right? I believe it’s called artistic license- an episode of an insane old woman would completely nullify the key issue of the episode- who gets saved, old or young amy. You’d save the young one to stop the old one going crazy. Job done. next planet please.

&gt; As a result of all of this, I don't count Older Amy as an example of why Amy's good as a companion. Because she's not. She's weak and useless and annoying, and while Rory is great, I'll be very glad to see her go.

Of course amy’s not a good assistant. She brings nothing apart from the shallow qualities you’d expect from someone who appears to have got by on their looks until an alien friend came back for them and an excellent husband. 

*older* amy is the first time we’ve ever seen amy as something other than the vapid mannequin she’s been since we first met her. Older amy can only exist in a vacuum, but that doesn’t negate how great she was- if only because she became so different to her younger self.

Only young amy **could** be an assistant. Older amy couldn’t because:

* she would never exist in the company of the doctor
* she fucking hated him when they came back for her

but that doesn’t mean she wasn’t an excellent character by herself.



&gt; And yes, for the record, I would absolutely take that deal, in a heartbeat.

That made me a bit sad.

To summarize, you can think about the economy in terms of the balance between the demand for services, and the ability to fulfill that demand, otherwise known as supply or the capacity of the economy. Inflation is thought to occur when demand is too high to be met by supply, deflation by the opposite.

To eli5, say there are 10 apples for sale; if there is only demand for 5 apples, the buyer has the whip hand, and the price goes down; if there's demand for 15 apples, there'll be a bidding war and the price goes up. 

So because they consider this recession to be caused by a downturn in demand, they think that printing money will counteract deflation, and not cause too much damage. 

One of the major lessons of the great depression is that a decrease in demand leads to deflation, which leads to people waiting for prices to go down, which leads to a further decrease in demand and a really catastrophic crash in the  economy.

Sadly, for the foreseeable future football in America will be relegated as a sport exclusively for youth.

Seems to me that there are kids like that everywhere, although being in the middle of nowhere can't help. Also, and I say this on the understanding that I consider myself fairly aligned with such people in many ways, I think many hippie types aren't great parents. There seem to be two things that are done wrong. One is treating children like miniature adults in some misguided attempt to give them freedom. I don't want to sound like some sort of fascist here but I do think (especially small) children need some sort of structure. You shouldn't constantly ask them what they want. (Although giving them choice sometimes is obviously good.) You should know what they need. The other is to try and isolate the kids from the modern world or popular culture eg not letting them play video games or watch violent films when they're a teenager. This is kind of self defeating since these children are going to grow up and live in the real world anyway. It's funny, because the two things seem quite opposed to one another, but I've seen the same parents do both.

&gt;Don't

This means 'refrain from' or 'discontinue'. It is a shortened version of the words 'Do' and 'Not.

&gt;be

In this context, means 'existing as'. It is not to be confused with the 'bee', which is a flying insect.

&gt;a

Singular identifier, suggesting that there is only one.

&gt;fucking

This one can confuse a simple mind, it's used in this context as an expression of frustration and to emphasise the strength of the next word and the statement as a whole. Ultimately, it's unneeded for the overall purpose of the statement, but can be considered a bonus.

&gt;retard

A person of deficient intelligence or mental prowess. 

&gt;.

A full stop, utilised in many languages to mark the end of a sentence or statement.

I hope this explains my previous comment. The overall point of the statement is a request to not go for the obvious red flag gag. It serves little purpose, it doesn't present you as witty and only makes you seem like an uncreative, stupid simpleton.

When reality was fixed Amy and Rory were living in that house the Doctor gave them while River would visit them once in awhile. Amy thought the Doctor was dead until River told them how he faked his own death. Then the Christmas Special- The Doctor; The Widow and The Wardrobe happened. At the end, The mother of the children he was taking care of told the Doctor he should spend his Christmas with his family and friends whom thought he was dead. So the last shot of the special, which I guess would be the last shot of the season, is the Doctor heading into Amy and Rory's house for dinner. Presumably, their adventure with the Doctor as they are his in-laws is not over yet. The Doctor did say he was going to leave them for their own well-being, but they are his family and he very well cannot leave them 'behind'. "") That's my take on it anyway.

true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"I consider myself an anarchist because I believe that fundamentally everyone is equal, and thus no-one has any innate right to tell others what to do - this essentially all that anarchism means, as far as I am concerned - a lot more in bolted on and grows from that, but that point is the core. 

For example, I believe all authority comes from either respect and trust, or from violence and threat of violence, and I would far rather the former than the latter. If I am to do what someone else asks of me I want to know that they actually have good reasons for it, and, ideally, what those reasons are; if I don't believe that is the case, and especially when I believe those reasons are actively detrimental to myself or others, I want to reserve the right to say ""no, not until you explain yourself"". If I cannot do that for fear that I will get hurt then I am not free, I am not being treated as equal, and I am not happy with that situation. 

Hierarchies will grow naturally through respect and trust - this is human nature, and this is fine - but those hierarchies must not be able to become entrenched to the point where shifting them when it becomes beneficial is too hard or people will suffer. This is my take on the idea of constant revolution. 

As for what is required - I don't think we can really have a true anarchist utopia until we have free energy and energy to matter transference because many many problems come from limitation of resources, and social structures frequently form initially to combat those limitations. By achieving unlimited energy and energy to matter conversion we effectively have unlimited resources (without having to find somewhere to put it all - space is of course another resource!)

In the mean time, the most important things are to minimise the undue influence of organisational corruption, minimise suffering, and promote education (including from an early age reasoning and deduction skills as well as just knowledge). 

We do not live in the worst possible world, but neither do we live in the best, and the fact that others have it worse elsewhere is no reason not to strive to improve our lot as well as theirs, especially where the two are connected (e.g. international finance). I do not believe I will see my ideal world realised in my life time, but I hope I will see some advancement towards it, and that not too many people will be hurt along the way. 

p.s. while I am labelling myself, I may as well add pacifist and transhumanist to the list too!

Just like many other fans, I was really critical of Kenny and co for not giving Meireles the 80k/ week he wanted. He was one of our best players, and deserved to be paid on par with Kuyt. 6 months later, I feel that our skepticism about the Meireles transfer has been validated, we could have used him this season for sure, which brings up questions about the decision making and priorities of our staff. In a season where champions league football was a must, I didn't understand why we were ""trading down"" for charlie adam. We need to keep players that are of Meireles' quality, no matter his age.

Many fans were also critical of the  Downing signing, and 6 months later it's pretty clear that we were right. He takes it to the outside every damn time, and he has absolutely no right foot. He's worth 10m tops.

Kenny also seems to have a very strong emphasis on the locker room and keeping every player's morale up...citing the dressing room of Liverpool in the 80's as a major reason for his past success. But what Kenny might not realize is how much *winning* helped his locker room, and the priority should be *winning games*, not keeping Andy Carroll happy. 

Lastly, what many people don't realize is that tactically it's sometimes easier to score against the big teams because they are more offensive and will leave more space to play in. For instance even though tottenham are a 'big team', they left no space to play in so it was like playing a mid-table team. We will almost certainly have more chances tomorrow against Man Utd.

We have a decent squad now and it's fantastic that we're in a final, but realistically it will be tough to get top 4.

Kuyt has not been at his best for the last 2 years, I actually think age has caught up with him sadly. I don't think he lacks footballing intelligence, it's just his pace has deserted him and he's never had a great first touch.

Kelly's preferred position is centreback, although with Agger and Skrtel playing like they are (Carra as a sub, and Seb Coates coming through) I doubt he's going to have much chance there and think his best shot is at rightback. That said he's ace, such a classy player.

Back in his school days little Jay Spearing played as a centreback, and he was rock solid at it, in fact he'd play in teams a year or two older than him and cope fine. I was gutted for the lad when he got sent off against Fulham, and hope that it doesn't deter him from tackling in the future. Let me tell you his tackles are immense and crunching (I've been on the wrong end of them a number of times!) 

Again I can echo the sentiments that Henderson will be epic in the future, I don't think he'll fully fill the void that Gerrard is going to leave (I doubt anyone ever will, he's one of a kind), but he'll do a very good job as long as he keeps developing.

3) Mainland Britain does not need defensive vessels really aside from fishery patrol boats or coastguard style boats. There is not a country on earth with a navy worth worrying about from a mainland perspective that is hostile to us. Our navy is to protect British interests and the interests of our partners. That is what it is doing in this instance.

4) I think compared to most other nations we have it pretty good. Aside from maybe Scandinavia and the Benelux nations we have one of the highest standards of living. Millions of people from across the world don't want to move to the UK because it is such a shitty place to live.

The banks have to balance their investments across risk factors, so when these government bonds are bought, they have to find similar investments, because the demand for similar investments increases the safest get cheaper and then the new money disperses quietly down the chain.

The theory is that this does a couple of things, frees up investment capital that spreads out into businesses encouraging growth and secondly ensures that long term interest rates are stable and lower than they would have been.

Dumping money into the liquid economy would have the wrong effect. Since it enters immediately there's no distribution curve so inflation would be immediate.

true,MooMorris,null,null,"My views are largely based on moderation and the Harm Principle. I vote, but hold no allegiance to any party, as I believe they are all run by people out of touch with the majority, and that they care little so long as they look good in the press and win votes (fact that voting figures are going down doesn't seem to bother them). I support free speech, unless it threatens the peace; so calling David Cameron a wanker is fine, but saying all Asians are inferior should be banned. The way humanity advances is through debate, and freedom of speech is key to that.

I'm a bit of an oxymoron in that I deplore violence, but applied to join the army. I think violence should only be used when there is no other option, but 98% is un-necessary. 

I believe you should be able to do what you want, so long as it doesn't harm others. Obviously, 'harm' is quite a broad word, but I like to think people will generally understand what I mean. Take drugs, for example; I hate them, but people should have the right to take them, on the condition they pay tax on them to cover the medical bills and policing of them. 

I think equality of opportunity is more important that equality of outcome. Give people the chance to do what they want and be the best they can be, and provide the tools for them to do it. If you give equality of outcome, people can become lazy and not work hard and things don't improve because there's no real reward for advancement- this is what happened in the USSR. As much reward as you should get for hard work, you should face the reality of fucking up.

Hierarchy is natural, and people need to be held accountable for their actions, which is why I believe in the police. When you take away hierarchy, the result is the London riots.

Everyone is entitled to human rights. I don't give a rats arse where people are from, their sexuality, opinions or whatever (the exemption to this rule is Man Utd fans). But, if you are using your rights to restrict the rights of others, you then forfeit some of your human rights. The EU is dropping the ball on this one; it pays farmers not to grow food, so land is wasted, and a lot of food grown is left to rot (the ‘food mountains’). Why they don’t just send some of this to Africa, or get the food grown and send that to Africa, I don’t understand- they are allowing people to die a painful death without reason.

I think people are naturally greedy and will always try to get ahead if they can. This isn't to suggest everyone is a bad person, but they will look after themselves. For this reason I don't believe in an unselfish action.

I can’t stand extremism of any sort. To be an extremist by necessity means you are ignorant of facts, and this means you can’t sustain an argument. A socialist saying all bad things comes down to capitalism is the same as a Christian saying all bad things come from the devil.
Should things be fairer? Yes. Do we have the ability to do it? Yes. Will it happen? No, because of the greed of humanity and the concentration of power. 

My views come from going to a university with a substantial socialist following, observations of people in different circumstances and coming from a very middle class area, but I have a working class background. I’m also strict on myself when I make a mistake, so deem society should be run the same way.

I'd love to eventually see a larger-single-market-for-labour, extended to the Commonwealth Realms, (and for that matter the entire OECD).

Lungbarrow however, requires lots of background knowledge, is hard to get the first 70 pages, and divisive among fans due to the semi-origin story at the end. But it blew my mind and it was my first novel so I love it to bits.

true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"To be honest I think we agree on a lot of things, perhaps I want to compromise less, but there is one paragraph I disagree with (well, disagree with half of anyway):

&gt; Hierarchy is natural, and people need to be held accountable for their actions, which is why I believe in the police. When you take away hierarchy, the result is the London riots.

Social structure is natural and hierarchies are a common form of that, and no doubt people should be held accountable for their actions (and that includes, when one has a hierarchy, holding those who give orders accountable for the actions of those who do their bidding, if there was no real choice in the matter, although this does not excuse the people who actually did whatever it was I was vaguely imagining). 

However, I do not believe in the police as they currently function - they serve primarily to protect the satuts quo, even when that is detrimental. As George Orwell may or may not have said, ""Men sleep peacefully in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf"", and there is some truth to that, but when there are people (be they police or military) standing ready to hurt people in my name for reasons I don't believe in and in ways I do not approve of, I object. While some policing is probably necessary in the current society and while we have a limitation on resources to protect us from the people who would want to take people's stuff, I believe the police do not adequately represent the society they are sworn to protect, and do too much harm relative to the good they do. 

As for the London Riots, there were a large number of causes and if a lack of hierarchy was one of them, it was only in that people had been downtrodden for so long that when that authority (through violence and threat of violence, not respect and trust) was removed people over-reacted. The looting was because they had repeatedly been told ""you can't have this, but someone else can"", and when the people saying ""no"" could no longer say ""no"" because the fear was no longer real for four days, the results were predicable. Of course greed, stupidity, vengeance, conformism, and a myriad of other reasons also played a part, but a simple lack of hierarchy is far too simplistic an reason! 

I can very much see the problem when one person's rights conflict with another's, and frankly I don't know what the answer is. If they cannot come to an agreement between themselves then obviously there needs to be some way of reaching an outcome, and if there is no third party trusted and respected by both then I honestly do not know how to resolve that situation. This is why I say we cannot have a true anarchist society until we have a lack of scarcity, and the only way I can see that happening is through free and unlimited energy and energy/matter transference.

I don't think any right minded person would think thats what ""Britishness"" means. I think these are facets of British society which could easily be attributed to various other countries. These aren't aspects of British identity are they? They are things which happen in this country.

1) Champion the likes of Rooney? Support our national football team? The nation doesn't pick the team so we pretty much have to support whoever gets chosen regardless of predilection for old whores.

2) The Daily Mail is the most read online English language Newspaper in the world with most of its readers from outside the UK.

3) Yes, we have waged war. Any nation with the power to protect its interests with force does so. You are naive to think this is a British trait because we of the Empire. Think of the peacekeeping work our forces do.

3) Not sure where you are getting this anti-intellectual thing from. Stephen Fry = national treasure and he is a caricature of an intellectual!

4) I haven't used force to exert my will today, I don't think many British people go about their daily living using force to exert their will.

5) Apparently we're on a paltry 18 a week, you really need to learn how to cite your sources when arguing with jerks on the internet.

http://www.aneki.com/watch_tv.html

6) awash with nationalism? I think most people would agree that Britain has largely lost its national identity, especially England. Compared with countries like America, France, Australia. Support for BNP is not linked to national identity, it is linked to political failings of the Labour party.

7) No food security? Just been tescos, bought a doughnut. Looked alright to me.

8) Serf under the monarchy and financial classes? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index

9) No industry? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_sector_composition

10) Stepped on if you are poor? One of the most generous social security systems in the world. Very rare for people to slip through the gaps to live. The fact that we have Social Security means a lot.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state

11) In terms of cramped houses I'm guessing you mean this? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14916580
The Irish can't get any one to live in the house they've built and they have completely omitted the fact that most europeans tend to live in apartments than houses, meaning those that are built are usually bigger as they are for the wealthier. The idea of everyman needing to own his own bit of land, THAT is a very British ideal.

12) Feral banking class? Do you think the bankers are better in any other country? It is a world economy. This is not a British virus.

13) Indifferent to war on terror? http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm
I think you'll be hard pushed to find anyone that supports or supported either of the wars in the Middle East.

14) In terms of riots I think we are doing ok, similar riots happened in France a couple of years ago.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_riots#2012
Plus, I think you are looking at the cause of the riots in a very simplistic manner. There are numerous causes, one of which, I agree was consumerism.

TL;DR: You're talking bollocks, these aren't ""Britishness"". I suggest you go and read some books about British identity rather than taking the most scaremongering aspects of the guardian and the mail and warping them into the view of the British nation you have now.

There is no human intervention because humans are too slow. She is also has very advanced SONAR and RADAR and is very capable at detecting any military threats which allows you to move your resources more strategically. She has a large compliment of anti-ship, anti sub and anti air weapons.  They are perhaps the most advanced ships of their type in the world. 

There is likely a Trafalgar class submarine in the area as well. The T class subs, although older are again extremely impressive. They've undergone a number of re-fits, the Argentines will have no idea where they are and I know a submariner on one of them, he said to me ""We could take your house out and leave your neighbours standing if we wanted to."" I am inclined to believe that. T class subs are not boats you want to have a fight against. One also can't help but wonder if HMS Astute might also be present, although that is entirely speculation.

4 Eurofighter typhoons. Very modern, extremely capable military aircraft that has had a lot of development. Very fast, very capable of taking out troops/ground vehicles or vessels or dealing with airborne threats.

Yatton is near Bristol, off the A370 on the way to Weston-Super-Mare (which is itself bound to feature on the crapmap sooner or later).

In Yatton, the bones of children do not grow properly. A typical teenager will appear to have rickets and something odd about the skull. Often the dome of the head will appear to be missing completely, and the jaw is extended toward the ground. I am no scientist, but there must be something lacking in their diets – perhaps food.

In Yatton, the elderly are like dirty, damaged vultures. They converge at awful jumble sales. They rummage and fight for socks and underpants that have been torn from the stiff corpses of their previous ancient occupiers.

The newly-clad wizeners parade, in purple Sta-Prest flares and grimy beige duffel coats, worn with ancient carpet slippers, toothless to Somerfield to buy Tizer and Superkings. If they speak to each other, nobody knows what they say.

I had an engineering friend go there - really popular guy at college, full of wisecracks and social confidence; but after six months he couldn't hack Loughborough, said it was all either extreme introverted geeks, or in-your-face brohemian-rhapsody douchebags with almost no middle ground between the two.

Additionally, if he operates on the Left wing, he'll get alot better coverage from Cole, and we all know he needs that.

It wasn't exactly on display in the Liverpool game since we were parking the bus and getting pressed really well, but he and Modric have a real chemistry that only comes with experience. That's also not even taking into account his leadership on the pitch. They both work their asses off and throw their bodies around, but there's just something about Parker that would make me want to play better. I'd follow him into the very fires of Mordor. 

For my money, Sandro will be considered the best DMF in the country within 3-4 years. I consider the guy just as important to our future as Bale and Modric. But I don't think we're overstating Parker's impact at all. ",0,1328842467,null,0,false,0,c3poqbo,t3_ph393,t1_c3poqbo,t1_c3pl5su,null,1428327025,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine.

My spouse first tried to start with the first series and didn't really care for the first episode. Kept watching anyway, because some of our friends were into it and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. But stopped after ""Aliens of London."" I still wanted to give it a try; I've been a lifelong sci-fi fan and already knew a bit about Doctor Who just because it's such a phenomenon. So our friends suggested we try again, but starting with the 5th series (which is how they started). We both loved it instantly and watched the next three episodes right then. We finished out the 5th series, took a detour back and watched ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"" from the 4th series to [spoiler](/s ""see the introduction of River Song (which is a GREAT way to first meet her- after already knowing her. Fits her character)."") Then we got series six because it's not on Netflix and finished that out. Watched the two Christmas specials with the Eleventh Doctor. And now we're both going back and watching the rest, starting from the first series. I definitely wasn't as taken in with the first episode of the first series with the Ninth Doctor as I was with the Eleventh, but I am already in love with Doctor Who now. I want to know everything, and that makes it interesting even when some aspects aren't. We got past ""Aliens of London"" together. ;) And The Doctor's smile? The same with every actor. They all got it right. Anyway, starting with the 5th series is what worked for me and that's what I've recommended to everyone.

In general his passing isn't incisive (when he attempts more incisive passes, he tends to give the ball away) and he plays a lot of 5-10 yard passes to the nearest player (hence his high pass completion rate). He often dallies on the ball and takes too many touches, allowing the opposition to man up. This is all very critical, and I do rate him highly, but I definitely believe he is very overrated.

As for the Liverpool game, Gerrard ran rings around him, and the reason he excelled at the end was that when Suarez came on, Dalglish shifted Gerrard to the right, which gave Parker a lot more space and time in defence, and meant he could drop into the back and clear all those balls into the box.

No?  Sovereignty is an absolute, whereas the balance between national and regional democracy is a political question which is present in most mature democracies.

&gt;I see no fundamental reason that a majority of independence-supporting parties in the Scottish assembly be a necessary or sufficient condition for a vote on independence.

I like the way you just declare that without feeling the need to back it up!

Here's why it should:

a)  Otherwise you end up with every issue which ever achieves 40% in any national poll whatsoever, triggering a referendum.  You'd be in continual referendum world, where even if something passed, you'd still be having continual referenda to reverse it.  It would cause ridiculous instability and expense!

b) You're saying that polls can be wrong, yet ignore actual election results!  Democracy is driven by elections, not referenda.  Of course conventional elections have primacy. 

c) It's necessary just like majority support of a parliamentary body is necessary for every other policy or significant government action.  It's sufficient because what else would you need?  A Yougov poll?!?  Why are you questioning whether it's sufficient?

Either you're going to have referenda triggered by actual votes in elections, or freak polls in newspapers of a sample of the electorate carried out by a private polling company!  Are you seriously arguing for the latter?!?

&gt;Nevertheless, if you believe that in response to an SNP majority Brown would have risked falling on his sword and gutting his party for the sake of Scottish sovereignty, and that I'm just a bad man for thinking otherwise, then well -- we'll never know for sure, so you're entitled to your opinion. Mine differs.

You're seriously saying that as leader of the Labour party, Gordon Brown couldn't have got himself parachuted into a safe seat in England?!?  It's a non-issue.

Also, Gordon Brown would have been confident of winning a vote on Scottish Independence just as Cameron is.  In fact, a Scottish Labour Prime Minister would have no problem dispatching a idea that generally only has 1/3 support!  Much easier than for a Tory PM who went to Eton.  

Furthermore, it would hardly gut his party.  Out of the last 18 Elections, 15 would have gone exactly the same way without Scottish MPs.

Yes, I find it inconceivable that the SNP could win a clear majority in Scotland and the UK government would not allow a referendum.  Such an action would cause a massive constitutional crisis. It wouldn't happen.

&gt;A cynic might also note that, although the current government is notionally unionist, Cameron is trying to force a yes-no vote on independence that would coincidentally leave him with 304 MPs out of 591, and for some reason he wants it now-now-now even though the SNP doesn't.


&gt;And I have no idea what the problem is. You are the one who appears agitated about something.

The only aspect is that 250,000 turned out and out of those 53 civilians required medical treatment, the vast, vast majority not seeing any trouble under the watch of the police.  So is this evidence of a police crack down?  Of course not.   The significant incidents came when a small group broke from the official march and started lighting fires and throwing stuff after the official protest had dispersed.

Then as a parting blow you just farted all over your argument!  School children know this.  The police even went to colleges planning protests to help them fill in the forms, to tell them why, and to explain that they were allowed to protest but why the forms were being filled in.  That as long as they did it not only would they have the law on their side, but the law enforcers would have to be there to protect them and their right to protest!

&gt;.if they could afford higher education...

You pathetic. pretentious. whiny. dickhead.  


You don't need a higher education to understand or to look up 'protest in the UK'.  In fact if you can't figure out intuitively that there's a civil code to be witnessed and a proper way of doing things then you shouldn't even be going into higher education.  Seriously.  If you can't understand something that is made understandable to the least academic of the community (they even say if you have any questions you can go to any police station and they'll walk you through it themselves, that they're obliged to.  They even did it for a group of highschool kids that announced a protest on Facebook but didn't do any planning.  They even pointed out that they wouldn't even be able to hire coaches to go to a protest if it was official because the company would be liable, and the sorted that out for them!), if you can't understand that, then you probably shouldn't even be issued with a T.P. license, let alone think about going to higher education.

As someone who works in online marketing (I'm one of the good guys I swear) I can inform you that the latest seminars and workshops I go to, especially the ones in my industry, are featuring talks on how to use sites like Reddit in ""New and engaging ways"" and one of the ways is to use memes as a format to allow ""Your client or consumer to understand the product at a level they are comfortable with""

There is also an influx of people joining this industry because it's fairly strong at the moment and they feel that they don't have many options and it's an easy role they can just idle away in until something else comes along. The people getting into entry level roles, which often come with the freedom for your own projects, see people using memes because they figure ""If I can get x traffic to y URL, I'll be able to prove I'm great at this!""

There are quite simple tests that can be done to find if most food is out of date such as gas levels or acidity; these could be included in the packaging and give a colour indication when food *actually* 'goes off'. On a mass produced scale this could cost little more than litmus paper but companies won't do it unless we introduce the threat of regulations and/or consumer will.

I also think air sealed compartments in fridges should come in; you could open a packet of food use half of it and then place in in an air tight container to limit the rate bacterial growth. People should also remember than reheating food more than once is worse for bacteria than leaving it out on the side.

By far, though, the most important factor is this: harmful bacteria in food is very rare, there are precautions to take but most bacteria won't hurt you because you have a highly evolved immune system. What's more, bacteria in food is actually what makes it tasty. When you eat a rare steak you're essentially tasting live bacteria and, you know what, it's delicious.

true,OldManPip,null,null,"Well, damnit, i wrote a long comment before i forgot to ask if it was for the Union or not. Copy/pasted it and then i forgot and i copied/pasted something else.
The gist of it was:

1. Get sports societies on your side. If you're in one already, makes it much easier. If not, get some on your side. The AU people, club presidents and etc. The sports people make up a BIG number of voters.

2. Get some of the other candidates in different positions on your side. Not sure how okay it is, but i've seen ""you get your guys vote for me and i'll get them to vote for you"" kinda deals happening throughout all the years i've been there.

3. Online voting is pretty awesome. Get people to do it. Most people won't have the time, energy and give-a-fuck to go down to Union/Library and sign some papers, EVEN if they're already there. If you can get a small piece of paper that says where to vote and your name on it, EVEN if they won't listen to your campaign speech. 

4. Social media was a big thing last year. Get it on it. Get people to get badges/profile pictures of your campaign poster/picture on Facebook and Twitter. Get a facebook group/page setup early, but hide it and make sure it has content on it so when you are allowed to start campaigning hit it up and get people on it.

5. Get a gimmick. I hate it but most years people have done it and it works. Stupid students. One rgood one was Super Steve last year in the form of Superman. Cliche and stupid, but it works.

6. Look at other University elections, specially the ones that are being held before you, like Southampton. Who won? How did they win? Email them and get a tip or two. Never hurts.

7. Know your shit. There are quite some random students that know what you're talking about and will try to stick it to you and if they think you don't know what you're talking about it, people will find out very quickly. This also helps for example in the live debates.

8. Get some media going. This goes hand-in-hand with the social media stuff, but get some videos of you, however crazy/interactive/weird you want them to but get them out there.

9. Get as many people as you can to help you campaign. The year i was involved in had a fair few people campaigning for others around Library/Union (but mind you, you're not allowed to do it inside of them) while the candidate was running around doing the various University lectures/talks they could. If you only have one or two people, all the activity will get them down and noone will want to do anything. The more people you have, the more you can swap them around depending on their own and your schedule.

10. Speaking of the talks, make sure you have a quick 2 min presentation ready. You can do it live just yourself, but i'd recommend having a flash drive ready to quickly insert into the computer while the other candidates, if any are there, are talking. Practice on it beforehand, and make sure you deliver a nervous-free speech and you'll have won more votes than you know. Most students don't give a fuck about who you are or why you're there, but if you can entertain them a little bit while you're giving some boring speech, you'll have won a few over. Make sure to tell them where they can find you if they have questions and TELL them that they can vote online. Can't stress that enough.

Hope that helps. 

*edit*
Make sure to also be giving out free candies/chocolate/cookies. People ALWAYS will grab them and it's just another opportunity for you and your group to get them to stick around for a minute and pitch them to vote for you. 90% won't give a shit and just want the free stuff, but you'll have a few good conversations out of it and some votes.

Just be ready for people to ignore you wherever you go, hate you for bothering them about this stupid election they don't give a fuck about, to only care about the free stuff you give and ignore what you're saying and to be shouting to vote for you while noone cares. Pretty disheartening stuff, but get ready for it because it's not fun at all. But come election results day, you might find it all worth it.

Anyway, the implicit guarantees offered by the State don't cost the taxpayer a penny to provide, and by driving down the cost of borrowing at Barclays actually benefits the UK economy in lower borrowing costs.

It's worth noting that it was the previous government that blocked - quite literally at the last moment - Barclays attempt to rescue Lehman Bros, and while such a transaction would have done considerable harm to Barclays in the short term, it would have avoided the panic that hit the banks when Lehmans collapsed a few hours after the UK veto'd the rescue package.

* Small differences will emerge in what services they offer. Top up plans will become available. And that, kids, will be that.

Is it a legitimate cost though? £150 to switch payment methods? Why were the meters designed in such a way that switching payment methods requires a whole new meter? IIRC DD billing is done by meter reading/estimation - and prepayment meters record electricity usage in much the same way that a conventional meter does, therefore I can see no good reason for such a system (other than profiteering via an attempt to keep people on a more expensive payment method).

Last year, it contributed between 8.3% and 9.4% of UK total revenues (depending on whether you include the entirety of oil and gas), and received 9.3% back from the UK Treasury. It did that with 8.4% of the UK total population, and an unemployment rate lower than London (Ayrshire is a problem, however). Outside of London, Scotland is the most attractive part of the UK for foreign investment too, and GDP is higher than anywhere else in the country (again, London aside). Those statistics are only for last year, and the picture isn't as rosy if you look further back than that, but the idea that Scotland *couldn't* exist reasonably well on its own just isn't accurate, and there are plenty of countries with far fewer resources than Scotland that do so quite happily.

The biggest issue for me - although far from a deal-breaker - is what will happen with the currency long term. Having interest rates set by London would see Scotland in a potentially worse position than if it were a member of the Euro where at least it would have some input into setting them.

Couple of examples: 

1. Loss of Lucas has meant that we have no natural holding midfielder that fills the gap between midfield and defence, picking up runners from deep and moving side to side to assist the full backs. For quite a few games we played with no holding player and this resulted in some poor results over the Christmas period. There were many times, for example I remember against Wigan where we were exposed because of this, but Kenny only brought in a holding player v Utd (FA Cup) and it was Carragher (who was dire). 

2. Inverted wingers while Andy Carroll is the forward. The best use of Carroll is early, whipped crosses into the box that allow him to power in and score from. It is very hard to get up at the back post and head a loft ball back across and in. Inverted winders naturally cut back thus delivering a later cross when the defence has more time to set themselves and the angle is generally not as favourable.

There are more examples but those are two of the most obvious to me. I was glad to see Spearing starting v Spurs, but I think he needs to be more disciplined. This could be his fault so I'm not going to blame Dalglish, but I would hope that he has been told to hold more.",0,1328879213,null,0,false,0,c3psq9x,t3_pj2fd,t1_c3psq9x,t3_pj2fd,null,1428329067,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

* **Parker** - Got to love him. *Is English so I don't have to buy an English EURO Cup-shirt (I'm on a tight budget).* Parker is awesome, and is also the kind of player I'd like to be (with Parker being a bit of a more defensive tackling machine compared to Modric).
* **Bale** - OMG. I love him too (obvious reasons). My nephew recommended Bale, I dunno, I might get him a shirt with Bale on, depending on how generous I'm feeling (or maybe two shirts for myself, but that's a bit of a waste).
* **VdV** - So awesome most of the time. Already have a replica with him from 10/11. Seems like a really good guy off the pitch as well (but most Spurs players are, thank God). Still an option though, even if he may be the weakest option of those stated.
* **Defoe** - One of the reasons I ""found"" Spurs. *Is English (see Parker reason, might not play though).* Usually performs well and 
* **Walker** - Still a bit unknown in the world. One of the reasons I ""found"" Spurs. Has performed exemplary, *is English (see Parker reason)*, but I don't like to play as a defender.

My dilemma seems to be that I want someone I like, and that I want someone that I want to play like, sort of a role model.

true,mao_was_right,cnty-wales,poverty,"&gt;We give money to financial institutions who charge us to borrow it back?

We don't really 'borrow it back'. We never really had it in the first place. The BoE doesn't actually print anything, they simply credit their own account by £50bn (virtual money!) and use it to buy the bonds. Once the BoE sells off all the bonds once the economy has recovered, it just destroys the money it's made, causing no net loss or gain.

Lowered long-term interest rates benefit the public in the form of cheaper mortgages and investments for small businesses, so essentially giving banks an incentive to lend money more freely is doing us all a favour. The whole process revolves around the idea that the more money that is moving around bank accounts, the more money the country is generating (through interest payments), thus a stronger economy. Yes, credit can be dangerous for people who don't live within their means, but the fact is, with the economy already in a mess you have to take the rough with the smooth.

&gt;Why can't we just give the money straight to the public again?

I don't know anything, but it sounds like not only a logistical nightmare, but horribly innefficient. How many of those people would just put the money in their savings account and leave it there?

I was a kid when this first came out and of course I watched it because it was SF, but looking back on it, what did it have to offer?

It was simply another variant on the ""trying to get back to Earth or its nearest equivalent"" story, same as Lost in Space, Voyager, BSG, HHGTTG (from Arthur's perspective), and a good many others.

Maybe this is a fundamental backdrop with which to explore the human experience, but it needs something to go with it, it seems to me, and I really can't think what it was in S1999.  Maybe they will find some new angles, as the BSG reboot did so wonderfully well, but I'm struggling think what they would use as a starting point.

Something that did intrigue me first time around was what was going on back on Earth: No moon means little in the way of tides, with huge disruption to wildlife and perhaps energy sources; loss of moonlight - with more effects on natural systems; disruption of orbital motion, day length(?), the many emotional attachments that the moon has; as well as the physical loss of the people on the moonbase, and the resources that they were providing, so perhaps that would provide some material, but afterwards, I don't recall any ongoing pursuit, on other continuing interaction with any particular aliens (except for Maya - and there is little original story material there), or anything else of substance to work with that we haven't now seen many times before.

The most enjoyable aspect of it in many ways, was the aesthetic - most notably the Eagles - a truly memorable design - but also throughout the set design of the base itself. It built upon a number of prior works including 2001, Silent Running and Anderson's earlier UFO, of course, and did it well. The continuing appeal of this look is perhaps reflected in the 2009 film ""Moon"", and I imagine that they would do well to maintain that style, and most certainly the Eagles.

If it were true, I'd be able to easily find a nice source for this blacklist of sites I'm not supposed to be able to access.

There are indeed some ISPs that actively block certain sites, like piratebay, that's not the same thing as there being legislation that forces them to do so though.

On the other hand, google removes things from their listings through (I believe) the DMCA, as detailed when there's a ""chillingeffects.org"" notification at the bottom of a search. That's an American legislation though and really has nothing to do with us, though I'm aware we have a European equivalent. There is absolutely nothing that tries to stop me (If I knew what the site I couldn't find on google was) viewing the site though if I simply type in it's address.

There is a huge difference between censorship through completely disallowing access to a website and telling google to remove x very CLEARLY damaging to human beings website from their search listings.

It should be noted that sites like Pirate Bay are in fact not illegal in the UK too, despite the current extradition case that's ongoing, there's legal precedent in the UK that says linking to somewhere you can download copyrighted material isn't illegal, pirate bay's changes to magnet links will solidify this as all they do.

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"Well, it's not even clear Scotland would be worse off financially at all. If you include all the north sea oil revenues that are in Scottish waters, Scotland is marginally a net contributor to the UK Treasury (without having control over corporation tax). Under those conditions, it's at least arguable that independence would make little difference.

Good question about foreign investment in the event of independence, but I don't think there's a clear answer. Business seems to be saying it doesn't care, but the only way of telling would be in the event it happens:  http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-does-scotland-look-bonnie-to-foreign-investors/9080. If corporation tax were lowered by even 1%, there's a fair chance companies might relocate to Scotland from London; many of the big financials already have significant presence in Edinburgh, and companies like RBS which is registered and headquartered there and not London would presumably start paying corporation tax to Scotland (or relocate their entire operation to London, of course, although that would cost them a fortune). UK Financial Investments Limited would then have a rather large stake in a foreign bank. 

Given that France has recently been downgraded, and I agree with you about the UK's rating, whether the remainder of the UK would continue to receive a triple A rating in the event of Scotland's secession with 10% of the economy and (potentially) 90% of the oil and gas reserves is questionable. Presumably they're taken into account by the credit agencies.

I'm not sure Ireland is a particularly good example given its position in the Euro, and the particular property bubble crisis that happened there. Scotland has a higher GDP and a bigger population, and greater natural resources.

Personally, while I'm against the idea of governments controlling what we have access to on the internet a la China, Syria etc, I don't like it when people compare real society-stifling censorship like that to things like TPB which is nothing to do with freedom of speech and just about being able to get entertainment without having to pay for it.

I can't really be too against sites like TPB getting blocked, much as I can't really be too against police seizing counterfeit DVDs and the like. I can't have too much a problem about laws applied to everything else in life also applying to the internet - if the law can shut down a manufacturing plant who's sole purpose is to produce counterfeit DVDs, then why can't it shut down a website who's sole purpose is to enable illegal downloads?

**Cocktails**: [Island bar](http://www.bar-island.co.uk/) near the Alexander Theatre or the [Jekyll and Hyde](http://www.thejekyllandhyde.co.uk/) especially if the Gin Parlour is open (you might have to call ahead).

**Real Ales**: [The Wellington](http://www.thewellingtonrealale.co.uk/) is probably regarded as one of the best in Birmingham for ale.

**Wine**: [Bacchus](http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/bacchusbarbirmingham/) is quite good if you want somewhere quiet with a decent selection of wines.  [The Vaults](http://www.vaultsbirmingham.com/bar.aspx) are also very nice, and do excellent cocktails - it's quite pricey though.

**General Drinking**: [Brindley Place](http://www.brindleyplace.com/) has some of the more 'upmarket' chains (All Bar One, Slug &amp; Lettuce, Pitcher &amp; Piano) if that is your thing.  The [Chameleon](http://thechameleonbham.com/) appears to be popular among this clientele also (although I haven't had chance to go along yet).  I have soft spots for the [Old Joint Stock](http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/) and [The Victoria](http://www.thevictoriabirmingham.co.uk/).  I'd say the Victoria is my favourite ""general"" pub in the city, actually.  It's behind the Island Bar mentioned earlier.

**Honourable Mentions**: if you are into a specific type of music I might be able to help more.  The Yardbird is very good, as is the Jam House.  If you are into rock music, 'The Flapper' or '[Scruffies](http://scruffymurphys.co.uk/)'.  There are regular drum &amp; bass, electronica &amp; indie gigs down in Digbeth.  If you want to go further afield, Mosley/King's Heath has a lot of good drinking and is home to the [Hare &amp; Hounds](http://hareandhoundskingsheath.co.uk/) venue.

**Clubs/Late bars**:  Check the [Arcadian](http://www.thearcadian.co.uk/) and [Gatecrasher](http://www.gatecrasher.com/venues/birmingham/index.html).  Again, depends on your tastes.

Drop a bit more information about your tastes and I'm sure we'll be able to give you some better pointers.

Pirating serves many purposes other than just getting something for free. It's a protest against Ubisoft's draconian DRM for example, DRM that only hurts the consumer in the end. It's the cause of fantastic new services like spotify and grooveshark. It's the sole reason photoshop is ubiquitous and has such a huge business in that it's because people pirated the software that it got such a massive presence of tutorials and the like as well as being what people learned to use and therefore simply the easiest thing to use rather than a free alternative that largely does exactly the same - this applying to a huge number of successful products.

While pirating might be illegal, I don't see it as a bad thing at all, I think it drives innovation, helps businesses that are intelligent enough not to viciously attack it and the like. While most companies will never agree with me on the record you can guarantee that the people at Adobe know full well piracy is good for them. - As just one example amongst many.

In fact, my pirating of various products over the years led to my eventual purchase of said products as I grew older. I'm a very strong believer in the stance that a pirated product is not lost revenue at all. While there's certainly some that simply do it for free, on the whole those people doing it to get something free are helping to make the product more widespread, which ultimately only helps most products.

Nobody will object to censoring paedophile sites, because, well, they're sick fucks.

What I appreciated about Being Human was that the characters tried so hard to live worthwhile lives, and to make good choices, even when everything else about them was dark and terrible. The first series of Misfits seems like an inversion of this, like ""evil Mitchell"" spread thin across five pathetic people and drawn out for a season. They're so invested in the misery of their circumstances, even getting superpowers doesn't make a dent in their short-sightedness, coarseness, and self-pity.

I think some of that is intentional--Nathan is just written to be a rude blarney-spouting prick--but some of it is a lack of imagination on the part of the writers. Look at Kelly, she's this one-dimensional chav horrorshow who probably doesn't have a life plan for further than 30 minutes from now and has never considered the minds of other people. Now she's a telepath, she could have all these stunning insights about other people's perspectives for the first time in her life, and instead, it's nonstop ""waah, she thinks I'm a slag"", ""gag, he wants to shag me"".

true,mao_was_right,cnty-wales,poverty,"It's definately an idea that I've heard being knocked around. The question is the logistics of it though. Firstly (and this is just off the top of my head), you'd have to decide who is and is not eligible for it (taking into account children, prisoners, people in care, people who work abroad etc). Then you'd need to know how to actually get the money to them. A lot of people don't have bank accounts. You can't exactly send £50bn of cash in the mail...

One idea was giving people vouchers that only they could use. Nice on paper, but by the time it takes to assemble enough people to organise and design the structure (this being public sector, *a lot* of people), perform trial runs, deal with inevitable cockups in process and delivery and appraise whether the whole shebang actually *worked* or not, we'd have already defaulted.

Next (and the hardest part), is deciding where you can spend the money and where you can't, and ensuring people give the money to the right people. For example, you could buy a new Volkswagen from your local dealer (you'd struggle with £850, but you could put the money towards it), but then you have to decide whether the British bloke who owns the dealership should be eligible when half the money goes to Germany. Secondly, how would you tell if anybody did actually spend it there? This is where the vouchers would come in, but we've already discussed the caveats of that idea.

Then there's dealing with the scores of people who won't spend it regardless, either because they weren't aware they had to, had the money nicked (or lost the voucher), died before they could spend it, or just plainly have issues with the government demanding that you spend £830 on something you may or may not want.

The difference is one shows you're actually interested and motivated to learn something to a professional level while just saying ""experience in VB.NET"" could mean you just learnt a bit about it in school. 

It might sound obvious but a lot of people just try and pack in as many acronyms and buzzwords as possible without thinking what the business value of the skills are to the company they're applying to.

The reason i ask this question is surely GBR would be screwed by the War Crimes Tribunal if war crimes were commited.

As for your link, the Belgrano was sunk 36miles from the exclusion zone. Which is not WELL out of the exclusion zone but kind of like the kid that winds the dog on a chain up.
 Why the hell did they go so close to the zone as a military vessel. In fact the picture on the belgrano link shows that the ship was approaching as close to the border as possible then going back. for example travelling E-W then W-E. Yet the British government stated  ""April 23rd, that ‘the approach’ of any warship or aircraft ‘which could amount to a threat to interfere with the mission of the British forces in the South Atlantic’ would encounter an ‘appropriate’ response. ""

As for the second hand weapons thing, that is Argentina's problem, they didn't have to buy second rate equipment. a
A win is still a win however pyrrhic.


Your point three about PTS, post trauma treatment and basic psychiatry 30 years ago was pretty shit, Hell 100 years ago and people who wouldn't go over the trenches were shot for cowardice.

I mean, there has been a continuous movement of people between Ireland and Scotland for as long as these isles have been inhabited and a large amount of people in Scotland are the direct descendents of Irish people. 

In the 5th century Gaelic language and culture spread from Ireland to the west of what is now called ""Scotland"" via the Dál Riata. These Gaels soon spread out to most of the rest of the country and merged with the Picts who inhabited the north and east of what is now Scotland to form the modern Scottish people. Indeed ""Scoti"" is what the Romans called the Irish and ""Scotland"" comes from ""Scotus"" which is Latin for ""Irishman"". This is why Scottish and Irish Gaelic are so similar. 

Many of the people who immigrated from Scotland to Ulster during the 17th century plantation were the descendents of these early Gaelic settlers. This means that as an ""Ulster Scot"" you identify as the descendent of people who went from Ireland to Scotland and then back to Ireland from Scotland. Doesn't that seem kind of excessive? 

Why not identify as Northern Irish, as that is where *you* are from, rather than trying to find an identity in the relentless island hopping of your distant ancestors? ",0,1328907747,null,0,true,0,c3pxndl,t3_pjv39,t1_c3pxndl,t3_pjv39,null,1428331376,9,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,9

Also you have to think the abortion issue in the way it is in america is an aberration even among countries where there is strong anti-abortion support. It is a social/religious issue that has been smacked into the political arena to fire up religious voters and repeatedly stocked and pushed for political advantage that simply doesnt (or possibly even cant) happen in far less religious society or a society less willing to bring in social issues into politics.

also most abortions are little more than a heavy period, later abortions requiring more invasive procedures are really quite rare and never as gruesome as the religious right make out. Their portrayal of abortion is akin to PTEA's portrayal of animals and farming.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Have you actually watched Sandro pass the ball? Or better yet, have you watched top DMFs go to work? Sandro is even less positive than Parker, and even less accurate when attempting to be incisive. 

There are only a handful of elite defensive midfielders who do a hell of a lot more than play 5-10 yard passes to the nearest player. He wins the ball back and gives the ball to players who can do something with it. He's not here to be Xabi fucking Alonso. 

And guess what? He's arguably the best in the league at doing that job. There is only one player in the country who makes more tackles per game than Parker, and he's in the top 10 in interceptions as well. There is nothing deceptive about that: he EMPIRICALLY dispossess people and breaks up attacks as well as anyone in the country right now. 

I rate Sandro as high as anyone in our squad, but it's blind favoritism and laughable to suggest he's a more complete player. Shit, for other teams Parker was much more of a box-to-box midfielder and contributed a lot to attack. If anything Sandro is a more specialized player. He is a pure destroyer. 

It's like you just watched my compilation and made up your mind on him or something. He gave the ball away a handful of times, which is still less than most of our players without a #14 on their shit. The purpose of this video was to show that in a sloppy game where both teams were constantly giving the ball away, Parker willed us through the final onslaught. It wasn't pretty, but he got shit done. 

I'm trying to be civil here, but your opening statement makes me want to smash my head against the wall. Statistics don't lie: he is not even close to overrated--let alone the most overrated player in the league.

Some membership plans allow you to watch simultaneously on more than one personal computer or Netflix-ready device. If you are on the Watch Instantly Unlimited plan or the 1-disc-out-at-a-time plan, you may watch only one device at a time. If you are on the 2-discs-out-at-a-time plan, you may watch on up to two devices at a time. Members on the 3-disc plan can watch on up to three devices. The maximum is four devices – available for members on the 4-or-greater-discs-out-at-a-time plan.Your account can have up to six unique authorised devices activated (and associated with it) at any given time, including personal computers and Netflix-ready devices. For example, if you're on the 1-disc plan, you can have up to six devices associated with your account, but you can only watch one of them at a time.

As for your question overall, General opinions on yanks are this

* Texas= steers and queers (blame FMJ) too much money, VERY LOUD
* Mississippi=hilly billies, shotguns, rocking chairs
* New York= Rude traffic jam, Exceptionally opinionated out spoken people, who moan about anything/everything
* San Francisco=Hilly shakes a lot, Very sunny, happy people
* Los Angeles= over paid celebs who don't have a clue how to behave (paris etc)
* Washington=that place that every other state moans about
* Florida=Old people who cant make up their mind
* Alaska=canada
* 

* * 
* On the whole USA man
* The appearance the americans sometimes give
* Canada is an addon to America
* Dont understand subtle jokes/sarcasm witticism
* Descriptive language eg sidewalk not path
* Overly patriotic
* Homophobic and still racist
* Did I mention LOUD
* Isolationist
* Overly Emotional
* 

fwiw I don't believe most of these however having watched CNN FOX et al this is how your country comes across. Hollywood doesn't help much either

There's also Snoopers paradise on Kensington Gardens, if you like looking at and playing with weird things from the past, it's the place to go. 

If you're into graffiti or street art, on the other side of Kensington Gardens is Kensington street where theres lots of Graffiti Murals. There's Also Banksy's ""Kissing Policemen"" on the side of The Prince Albert Pub, right near the station. 

For Food I would definitely recommend Pompoko, atmospheric, cheap and really good food! Also, this might not be the prefect time for it, but Boho Gelato, near Pool Valley is my favourite place in Brighton EVER! Best and most innovative Ice Cream I've ever had.

If you're going to go to the Pavilion, you should also have a quick peek in the Pavilion Art Gallery and Museum in the Pavilion gardens, its free so you might as well.

There's also a really cool TEENY TINY alley way between The Cricketer's Pub and ""Pho"" the vietnamese restaurant. If you walk along it (only big enough for one person), get to the other side, cross the road and walk along the TEENY TINY alley way directly opposite, when it begins to widen out a little bit, you'll see a bright pink little artists studio.

&gt; ""While he was at Number 10, Tony was virtually gagged on the whole question of religion,"" says Mr Burton. 
""Alastair [Campbell] was convinced it would get him into trouble with the voters.

But that didn't stop him. 

&gt;Mr Blair has previously admitted that he was influenced by his Christian faith, but Mr Burton reveals for the first time the strength of his religious zeal.

&gt;In it he portrays a prime minister determined to follow a Christian agenda despite attempts to silence him from talking about his faith.

&gt;""But Tony's Christian faith is part of him, down to his cotton socks. He believed strongly at the time, that intervention in Kosovo, Sierra Leone – Iraq too – was all part of the Christian battle; good should triumph over evil, making lives better.""

&gt;Mr Burton, who was often described as Mr Blair's mentor, says that his religion gave him a ""total belief in what's right and what's wrong"", leading him to see the so-called War on Terror as ""a moral cause"".

&gt;""I truly believe that his Christianity affected his policy-making on just about everything from aid to Africa, education, poverty, world debt and intervening in other countries when he thought it was right to do it.

By the way, Wilf was my favorite companion. That man was wonderful. 

My interpretation of it was that whenever he regens he completely loses who he used to be. As in, he loves his life so much that dying is like literally dying to him, and he just becomes a different person who can never feel the same things he could before.

All kinds of contraception and the morning after pill are freely available over the counter at pharmacy's in Ireland. No need to see a doctor, but yes if you are on a lower income the state will pay for it (there is no NHS here) and the consensus generally is pro-choice for anyone who this will actually have an effect on, regardless of our laws on reproductive rights. 

The reason that no laws have been passed is because it is nearly just as easy to go to the UK for an abortion as it is to travel about Ireland. It actually costs more to get a bus from one end of the country to the other than it generally does to fly from Dublin or Cork to anywhere in the UK. Couple this with our large older population, who are the only ones who actually vote, and you will have a parliament of older men who are too scared to do anything progressive as they will find themselves voted out in a heartbeat. Most of our young who are more inclined to be political only stay long enough to get a university education and then emigrate because the powers that be have never found a sustainable economic model to work towards. (At the last estimate 1,400 are leaving a week, and even when times were good the young only stayed long enough to save and gain work experience so they could leave)

This is why the EU (and its various directives) have been a major boon to Irish society because mostly our outlook is more liberal than our laws would state and the politicians get off the hook with the old dears (aka the electorate) by hiding behind, ""look, we don't want to pass this but we all signed up to the EU, so... "" Hypocritical? Definitely, its more of a ""not in my backyard"" situation because the UK is so handy. Most of our political parties are centre-right and stem from the foundation of the state so you can imagine it is a complex situation.

Long story short, the public consensus does not equal the standing legislation in a country.

As has been said, the Stoke game was one such example. Tony Pulis changed to 4-5-1 when he saw we had 3 at the back, but despite this, Kenny didn't then push Coates or Agger into midfield or sub one of them. Other issues include his sometimes strange substitutions - my main gripe being whenever Carroll is subbed on for Downing, who would be the ideal man to cross to him. The only other game where I have major tactical complaints against Kenny is the 4-0 to Spurs. Starting Skrtel at RB with Henderson/Downing in front of him was always going to end in a Bale massacre.

I can understand his reluctance to push Agger into DM while Spearing was out, him and Skrtel being great at the back, and it's not his fault Carragher is such a limited footballer he couldn't do the job against United.

**Downing:**

Downing on the left has shown not to work as Enrique and Downing get into each other's way when going forward. It was frustrating to watch. I've been pretty frustrated overall with Downing and his timidity, but thought he made a nice bounce back after Daglish tore into the team and it he actually played with balls. I was surprised to see him back on the bench. 


**Spearing**

I appreciate his defensive capabilities, but the Spurs game is still fresh in my mind and he was pretty bad. He gave away a lot possession and killed several potential counters. I partially blame Daglish for this... why did he keep him in the game when Spurs were content to sit back and defend the entire match?


**Adam**

I'm afraid when Adam is on the pitch... Afraid he is going to get a red or give a pk. He makes so many stupid and unnecessary fouls. I hope it is something he can improve. I have hope for him. He makes some truly amazing long diagonal balls to the corners... and if our guys out on the flanks could play a decent cross or Carroll could get better positioning and get on the end of some of them Adam would be much more effective. I think the entire idea with Adam was to have the ability to play this long ball out to the corners where we should be getting a lot of crosses/services into our big striker's/target. The plan isn't working.... who to put the blame on? Downing? Carroll? The team? Kenny? I think it is partially on all of them. 


**Carroll**

Despite being annoyed and frustrated I still have high hopes for him... I just hope he sorts his head out. Too often he stops to complain and not continue play. Other than that we've seen some big improvement the last several matches and hopefully it continues. 


**Team**
In an ideal world we'd be have the option to play target man football or pass and move football with the players we have. Unfortunately it isn't clicking yet. I think we leave Carroll on an island and provide very poor service and little to no support. We should have people flying around him ready for knockdowns and flick ons. We need someone who can actually play a threatening ball into the box... someone who can whip it in. Too often I've seen us drive to the line and lob in some halfassed floater while Carroll is waiting flat footed. Players need to take note of Gerrard's service into Carroll which usually came in earlier and while he was moving towards goal. We will be much more effective and threatening. We really need to get a right winger and sort Downing/Enrique out on the left. While Bellamy has been great and clutch for us... we need to think about the future. We need wingers who can beat their marks and play threatening balls in. Wingers who are also versatile enough to invert (switch sides) so they can cut inside on their good foot for a rip at goal. I also think a poacher would do well for us to knock in some of these missed chances and post/crossbar shots and can cleanup off of the havoc Suarez creates... but first I want some real wingers.

true,zolalala,1986,"  Didier Drogba","for me, my main concerns are the tempo of play, Everton have shown signs of being a very disciplined team in a slow build up, and very explosive when they push the pace. the game will be decided on the wings defensively i feel at least, with Baines pushing up our right and Donovan to the left (of the CFC formation mind you). the cup tie with QPR was way too negative for my tastes, too few chances off such a wealth of possession. then the Howard Webb i mean...the United game, they decided to open up and play true Premier League style when they had a padded lead. so to me, keys to victory are keeping Baines running backwards rather than forwards, eliminate space on the wing for Donovan and tightly mark all options around him considering he's had a hand in almost every goal i've seen them score, while first half, if you want to play them like QPR, fine, control the game in the first 15, but then apply the pressure until the halftime whistle, and if CFC get the lead, then play the Iberian Peninsula style, 60-40 them in possession.

If you would like to ask me some questions about the EU and what I support about it and what I don't, you're welcome to.

EDIT: Having read over your comment a few times, I think I've worked out that you think that I don't actually know anything about the health bill, that I am totally against the PM and that I am blindly in favour of the EU. I know lots about the health bill and its impacts, I am not totally against the PM but I do not agree with a lot of his policy and stategy and in this case Lansley is the one I have issue with and I am not blindly in favour of the EU at all.

Also, your flair is an English flag. England ceased to exist in any meaningful administrative way in the 1707 Act of Union  and has not had its own government separate to that of the UK since. The Administrative area since 1998 has been 'England and Wales' although of course Wales has its Assembly. So why do you have the St. George's Flag?

true,skinnyhulk,eng-kent,Kent,"* While loud pipes ARE noticeable when sitting next to a dude blipping his throttle, you can barely hear him once you are in motion. That is, unless you’re right behind him. http://motorcyclementor.com/motorcycle-myth-loud-pipes-save-lives/
* When a race car is approaching you at 300 Km/hr as you sit in the grandstand, you actually hear very little -- maybe a high-pitched whine. It's not until the car is right in front of you and moving past that you hear the roar of the exhaust. Then it's deafening as the car disappears into the distance. Same with an airplane or any moving object. It's the way sound waves travel.
* As you approach a car or pedestrian, your loud pipes will not be particularly noticeable, but will become very loud once you are adjacent to, and passing, the other vehicle or person. The effect is often to startle the driver or pedestrian -- AFTER you have passed, with little warning that you are approaching. Your loud pipe is actually ""warning"" people behind you,
* Therefore if the cager didn't see you in the mirrors before approaching the blind spot chances are they will not hear you until you are past the prime danger point. I wish I could say loud pipes do save lives, but the physics behind it just doesn't work.
* another example (although anecdotal or requiring you to see for your self) travel down the motorway in peak biking season with a mate, (take the car if this is easier) have him travel with his bike and loud pipes a fair distance behind. Even if he makes as MUCH noise as possible you will not hear him, even with the windows down or up. At higher speeds of both vehicles they effect is greater, ie neither will hear each other.

With regards to low speeds (reciever) pop down to your race track on a Moto GP day, (loudest fucking exhausts on the planet) when the bikes are coming towards you they are actually quite quiet, but once they pass you cannot hear a thing.

Btw I didn't mean they Reduce visibilty just they have no effect on visibility, need to start sleeping more :-)
Better off adjusting your riding style so people will see you as opposed to relying on loud exhausts (stay out of the blind spot). Peace out dude and ride safe.

true,mishagale,english,London,"&gt;Well nobody likes the idea of killing a little unborn child

This is part of the abortion debate I've never really liked. *If* a foetus is a ""little unborn child"" then clearly abortion is killing a person, and in almost all circumstances would be morally abhorrent.

If, on the other hand, a foetus is a cluster of undifferentiated cells, then someone having an abortion should no more feel guilty than someone having liposuction or a tumour excised.

Abortion either is killing someone, or it isn't. It can't be a little of both.

I don't understand people who are ""pro-choice"" but claim abortions are ""a big step"" and ""shouldn't be undertaken lightly."" Of course, as a medical procedure they carry risks, but this doesn't seem to be the reason for such statements. Statistically, early-term abortion is probably safer than giving birth.

I can see that precisely when a foetus becomes a living human being is obviously a grey area, but when we are talking about a teenage girl who is a month pregnant, what reason is there to make her feel guilty about choosing to have an abortion?",0,1328969463,null,0,false,0,c3q50h9,t3_pjmmb,t1_c3q50h9,t1_c3q3e7l,null,1428334956,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;He just doesn't seem to understand that freedom of religion absolutely must include freedom from religion. The only way to maintain both is for the state to take an explicitly neutral stance towards religion, and part of that is not having a government body lead mandatory prayers of any kind, especially only those of a single religion.

This is exactly the point.  You can believe whatever kind of fucked up shit you like in private and civilized society should provide you with the space to believe it.  However, when it comes to outward actions and interaction with others, civilized societies need to protect the rights of all groups with an even hand. No special privileges for any group over others, no right to treat other groups in a discriminatory manner.  Personally, I'd prefer to live in a society composed of enlightened beings who do this naturally because they know it's right without any need for State intervention, but since we're stuck with a State for the time being, then it must act neutrally in the affairs of people. 

Historically, the church wielded a lot of power, and could use the State to secure for itself privileges, today it has a lot less power, so it's possible to restrain the State from acting on behalf of religious people.  I can dream maybe one day we'll be able to do something similar to prevent the State from working on behalf of the rich, albeit I suspect that'll require a rather more radical transformation of society.",0,1328969543,null,0,false,0,c3q50oo,t3_pkoq9,t1_c3q50oo,t1_c3q4u6s,null,1428334958,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I 100% agree that everyone must be a defensive rider.  You cannot rely on any one thing to save your life.  On a cloudless day, on even pavement, going 10 under the speed limit, all alone, you can have a serious mechanical problem occur on your bike and you're in the ditch.

Personally to protect myself, I drive defensively. Remain where the driver should see me, mostly behind the mirrors that drivers actually check (middle and on rare occasion right).  Keep safe distance and try to maneuver out of the way of tailgaters to let those muppets continue on their way.

And while I do understand sound wave propagation, the Doppler must be taken into context (not trying to refute scientific proof) just providing my logical thought process):

I'll open with the simple question, when do you really want a car to notice and avoid/be cautious around you? The answer normally, is when it is near you. 

Now lets lay out specific situations - 

Should a car becoming in the opposite direction. 
   Well sound will not alert them, but that is what the running head light/reflective vest-gear/and defensive driving/risk mitigation is designed for = on coming threats. I would like to stress sound should be used for when others can not see you and as you are in these driver's front FOV (field of view), you must rely on all visible ques at your disposal.

Should a car be traveling perpendicular to you or in the same direction but maybe turning in front of you.
  To me these are the most dangerous times, where the only thing you can rely on is your own safe driving practices because if people don't check for the visual ques and they can't check for the sound, then you don't exist, and should always treat a negotiation of this situation as if they are going to act as if you are not there. 

For the final situation - 
If the threat is only motorists traveling in the same direction and is adjacent to you or the a driver following behind you (potentially to close)
   As you have already managed risk/danger ahead of you (such as on coming traffic or those cars traveling in your same direction but far enough out that their action do not pose any real threat to you), you are actively trying to remove yourself from being directly abreast of larger vehicles, and trying to move out of the way of someone following to close THIS is where your pipes can save your life.  As you said these are the places (abreast or behind) that motorists could actually hear you.  

Whilst stopping I routinely slow down a significant bit ahead of where I need to, to allow the driver behind me to take note as to how quite a motorcycle can decelerate, then with the clutch in, I rev the motor, so that if they didn't immediately notice that they are closing on me they do at that point. 

Side question: the luxury cars that drowned out sound around them, I've seen these commercials, never experienced one though.  But it is utterly fantastical.  Just for my own curiosity, are the deaf allowed to drive? If not and these cars do exist, then why not? Should these cars actually work as well as they are advertise, why would my neighbor who lives in a brick and mortar house (which by fierce contrast has more insulation/noise dampening characteristics) complain of hearing my bike 

TL/DR: Pipes will NOT save your life by alerting drivers of your presence in ALL situations. But can be an invaluable tool, to notify drivers under the right circumstances.

* Without Lucas we need a CDM... I understand why Spearing is being played as Adam/Gerrard are not up to par defensively at tracking back and  we were getting overrun without a CDM. Really what we need is an adequate CDM to fill in for Lucas. I've been suggesting moving Agger up and putting Coates at CB for awhile now. 


* Henderson... I have hope, I want him to prove me wrong and see moments of brilliance, but too often he disappears and like today makes very unnecessary errant passes losing possession.


* Adam... I agree. High hopes/potential.


* Carroll... I agree. High hopes/potential.


* Kuyt... Disagree. He is past his prime. We need an out and out winger with pace and skill to take on and beat defenders. Downing/Kuyt isn't cutting it and I'd rather not rely on an aging Bellamy's form or knees to provide what we need on the flanks.

United were far more motivated than us for this match. They'd just come from a 3-0 comeback against Chelsea, the league is their priority and they're in a battle for top, they were at home and they'd just been knocked out of the cup by us so they had a lot to fight for.

 We, on the other hand, are in a battle for 4th, we're playing all the other teams battling for 4th before the end of the season. I'm going to reserve my full judgement on the ability of the squad for those Arsenal, Newcastle and Chelsea matches but it's clear that we need to be more motivated for the games we're expected to win (i.e. Bolton, Stoke, Norwich where we have lost points which really would've helped us out). There does seem to be weaknesses regarding certain players which has already shone through though.

 We do have a big problem with motivation, we were sluggish and boring today. Nobody was making any attacking runs off the ball so we ended up playing it back to Reina or the CBs and banging it up field to try to make a break, which resulted very often in just giving them the ball. We had an unusually poor defensive performance today too. It wasn't terrible but against United you've got to be on form or they'll hammer you.

Yeah, of our main midfielders he's probably also the best defender, but we need to score fucking *goals*, and he's also our best midfielder going forward. He *needs* to be our attacking center mid where he can find some form. Sure, the guy could probably play any position on the field decently well, but taking advantage of that and asking him to play a different position every week has always hurt his form. Put him up high and leave him there so he can get his passing sharpened and start dropping bombs on people. I suspect we'll see some more of Shelvey in the coming weeks as they struggle to figure out the best current lineup, so keep your hopes up. 

Obviously wing attacking is the other main problem for us now, and I honestly don't know what the answer is. I agree with the assessment that Bellamy kicks ass for 45-70 minutes, but can't be relied upon for every outing. Kuyt has slowed down a decent amount lately, which is to be expected since he's already given so much over his career. It's also really hard for me to keep defending Downing after that ghastly performance today, and he's our ""only natural winger"". So I don't know what the fuck they're gonna do about the wing situation, but I'd almost say start recalling loan players (if possible) like Ecclestone and Pacheco and fucking give them the chance they deserve to maybe add something to our attack for the last couple months of the season.

Yes we can. We looks at the laws. In one country guns are only allowed for hunting, and must be kept in secure gun cabinets.

In the other guns are given out like candy at a childrens party and it takes about 3 days for a background check and you can have almost any gun.

&gt;g. On a similar statutory defence, DPP v Bayer and Others (2004) 1 Cr. App. R. 493[4] dealt with defence of private property as a defence to aggravated trespass under section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

&gt;The court held that if defendants argued they had used reasonable force to defend property from actual or imminent damage that would constitute a criminal act, then the court had to consider whether, on the facts as the defendants honestly believed them to be, the force used was reasonable in all the circumstances.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_of_property

Where going into an unlocked car is very little force and you have an honest desire to protect property it could be legal. The issue is [mens rea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea), proving the intention of the subject. For the offence to be complete you would have to prove intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. It is easier, in theory, to believe a police officer is doing so honestly than a member of the public.


There is also an offence of vehicle interference


&gt;A person is guilty of the offence of vehicle interference if he interferes with a motor vehicle or trailer or with anything carried in or on a motor vehicle or trailer with the intention that an offence specified (theft) [....]


[Criminal Attempts Act 1981](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/47/section/9)


Again you'd be hard pushed to prove you were trying to save property than steal it and could risk arrest, if not being charged at the end of it.

I liked the [Museum of Time and Tide](http://www.great-yarmouth.co.uk/whats-on/thedms.aspx?dms=13&amp;venue=0226501), its built in an old herring works and is a museum of the sea, local fishing industry, and the local area generally. [Norwich castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_Castle) is good, but its a bit a trek back from Yarmouth to there. There's also the [Nelson Museum](http://www.nelson-museum.co.uk/) in Yarmouth itself. The [Norfolk Museum site](http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/) has a list of other [events](http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Whats_On/index.htm) going on.

Yarmouth tourist board have a site with a [places/event list](http://www.great-yarmouth.co.uk/), and there are usually printed ones in the places on the sea front

Once you are there, the Eastern Daily Press and Yarmouth Mercury normally have whats-on sections for the week.

The Deaf can drive in the UK (don't know much about other countries though. I personally think the only time loud pipes ""could"" save lives is when filtering in summer and the car windows are down.

You say when you slow down you do it significantly before you need to turn. Try this, get used to activating your brake light without engaging the brakes, MOST motorcycle brakelights come on long before the pads even touch the discs, and that is far more effective than expecting them to notice minor changes in speed from a small object. It really does work. Road positioning makes a huge difference as well. Have you thought about trying a Bikesafe day?

BTW as for sound proofing ""Most vehicles and cars these days have sufficient sound insulation installed during production."" http://www.keepitquiet.co.uk/motor_vehicles_soundproofing.html
http://www.teamrocs.com/technical/pages/sound_proofing.htm
In fact I happen to know that it is LAW for tractors with cabs fitted  to have sound proofing, i think it must restrict noise to below 65dB or something similar.

With response to your neighbour, you could probably fart and he would hear it, he sounds like ""one of those"". Brick and mortar houses etc and streets in particular also have an acoustic resonance type thing going where if a window or door, or letter box is open any low frequency sounds get amplified, kinda like a subwoofer. Plus if it is a quiet street, any noise even from someone walking in big boots will make him notice. The human brain tends to tune out ambient noises. For example those people living next to a motorway, dont actually hear the motorway as it is just background noise. But if like me and you are a country bumpkin i hear every noise from outside.
