They have a ton of extra games due to winning the Champions League and despite having a big squad they will still encounter issues like Barca did last season (losing Villa for the season during the Club World Cup). Also Di Matteo had a league record worse than AVB, not to mention he lacks a settled team due to a raft of new signings. Don't rate him as a manager either. Lampard/Terry/Cole all showing signs of decline too.

Arsenal have strengthened and I think Cazorla is the best signing of the summer so far but they really haven't strengthened where they so obviously need, in defence. Wilshere still not coming back anytime soon. Giroud and Podolski could misfire and if Van Persie goes they could be in trouble with regards to a top 4 place.

I also have a sneaky feeling Man Utd will trip up somewhere during this season unless if they sign a central midfielder.

Tottenham haven't strengthened greatly, although Sigurrdsson may be an improvement on Van der Vaart, and most importantly they have yet to sign Adebayor who was so crucial for them last season.

Newcastle, surprisingly, have been unable make any real moves so far and I don't see Ba and Cisse firing so emphatically next season to be honest. They rode their luck a lot last season and are heavily dependent on Cisse to score (or Ba if he is played centrally). Also they have the Europa League to contend with this year round which could trouble them as they don't have much depth.

Liverpool have yet to make their biggest moves this transfer window so I'd wait before making such judgements but I do think it is absolutely necessary that we hold onto Agger and sign Ramirez/Dempsey if we are trying to finish in the top 4.",0,1344386254,null,0,false,0,c5pqp3m,t3_xuf1r,t1_c5pqp3m,t3_xuf1r,null,1429579576,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

There's also wages. Someone on another forum made a great point: if this guy sees all his buddies joining big clubs and making 100k a week, what do you think he's going to want?

They also 'forgot' to tell the owner I'd given notice, and  also 'forgot' to pay him a month's worth of rent. This culminated in him turning up as we were moving out, thinking we were doing a runner and threatening to call the police.

After I moved, I wrote a bit about the agents on my blog. 6 months later, I got hauled in at work. Rather than complain to me, they went to my employer, who then had to get their lawyers involved to make sure they weren't liable for anything I'd said. That part's not really my problem (they were covering their own back), but it didn't make me look good at a time where I was applying for a new job at the same company.

I ended up taking down the posting just to shut them up. They were the biggest bunch of dicks I've ever had the misfortune to deal with, and (since this was about 8 years ago) I hope they've gone bust.

Let's say one of our players gets called up as a reserve, not much is expected from him. He comes on for five minutes but obviously doesn't have much of a chance to affect the game. However, during training the day before, he impressed the international manager. Despite only playing five minutes for his nation, he might get another call up soon, which can lead to more call ups, more attention, higher transfer values, higher wages, and hopefully one day he'll start in a World Cup or something. This would not be possible if the club denied him that opportunity.

That being said, I think there are some times when it is appropriate to hold a player from playing an international match, if we had an important final or semi final or season-defining game coming up.

This guys seems like a smart buy if you can get him for 20mil. Realistically who else is out there right now that would have us jumping up and down if we could get them?

Huntelaar? Llorrente? Would love either of them, but big price tag, big wages and 5 years older than Damiao.  Remy? Evidently AVB isn't interested in him.  Who else falls into that category? 

Not saying we need to buy him because we have no other options, but Damiao is probably one of the smarter buys we can make with the pressure we are under.

Again, either we give him a chance, or we get rid of him, and since we decided on the former, there goes our no. 2. Thats 2 strikers in a team that uses 1 at a time, and thats all we need (e.g. Real Madrid has only Benzema &amp; Higuain). I know its a big gamble to go into the season with just these two, but buying someone else while keeping them and playing a 1-striker tactic makes absolutely no sense.

He's sneaky and untrustworthy but shows kindness and concern for his granddaughter, and there's genuine anguish in his voice when he talks about being alone and friendless and never able to go home. He's running from something that terrifies him, and given his suspicious behavior, you're forced to wonder if he's not a criminal fleeing just and proper arrest. And here's something significant: His first major decision here, to kidnap and flee, makes everything worse. This isn't a guy with a grand plan who can wave his sonic screwdriver like a magic wand—this is a guy who recklessly and foolishly courts trouble to satisfy his ego and curiosity and often gets in over his head.

1) It is astonishing that West Ham would offer Carroll a:
&gt;massive eight-year contract on offer from West Ham that in total would be worth an astonishing £36 million.

   - Especially since West Ham are just getting back up from relegation, and financial reality might not support this kind of spending. However, wild and irresponsible decisions are no strangers to football finance and administration.

2) If this story is true, then LFC is demoralizing a guy who wants to play for us, and prove himself. The missus and I were at the game in Baltimore. The thing that she still recalls about the game is how Andy charged at the Spurs defender who kept throwing Sterlling to the ground. The point of this is Carroll **wants** to be a Liverpool player. If he ends up being sold, the scar of being sold by both Newcastle and Liverpool might effect him in many ways. 

3) How, and if Carroll fits into Rodgers system is secondary. If he is going to be sold, then it needs to be done without all the drama and speculations.

true,redadil4,lfc68,,"&gt;1) It is astonishing that West Ham would offer Carroll a:

    massive eight-year contract on offer from West Ham that in total would be worth an astonishing £36 million.

    Especially since West Ham are just getting back up from relegation, and financial reality might not support this kind of spending. However, wild and irresponsible decisions are no strangers to football finance and administration.




Still doesn't mean he won't leave for a different deal.



&gt;2) If this story is true, then LFC is demoralizing a guy who wants to play for us, and prove himself. The missus and I were at the game in Baltimore. The thing that she still recalls about the game is how Andy charged at the Spurs defender who kept throwing Sterlling to the ground. The point of this is Carroll wants to be a Liverpool player. If he ends up being sold, the scar of being sold by both Newcastle and Liverpool might effect him in many ways. 




The only problem with that is that LFC probably are only thinking in their own best interests.



&gt;3) How, and if Carroll fits into Rodgers system is secondary. If he is going to be sold, then it needs to be done without all the drama and speculations. 


We're Liverpool, drama comes even when we aren't doing anything.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Well, for starters, Moffat *loves* putting in classic references. Such as The Doctor getting dressed in a hospital during The Eleventh Hour, library card in Vampires of Venice, Victory of the Daleks 'I am your soldier' is a reference to 'I am your servant!' said by the Daleks, in Cold Blood he asks for a stick of celery, in The Lodger The Doctor asking if Football was the sport 'with sticks', referencing the fact that he knew how to play cricket.

And that's just off the top of my head about season 5 :p. All these little connections help remind you that, yeah, this is the same guy that's been travelling for lordy knows how long, and started in An Earthly Child. Oh, and just to toss it in, one of my favorites was the line,""You've redecorated...I don't like it,"" in Closing Time.

Also of note, just because I always thought it was interesting that Moffat did this, Amy Pond was born in 1989, the same year Doctor Who was put on 'hiatus'. She first met The Doctor in 1996, the same year the Doctor Who movie came out. When The Doctor went to 'jump forward 5 minutes', and skipped to the future by accident, it was 2008, the year Moffat was first announced to be the successor to Doctor Who. Then, finally, The Doctor picks up Amy to join him in the TARDIS in 2010, the year Moffat's first season of Who aired.

Anyway, I'm slowly getting off topic. I think River completely has it in Silence in the Library where she's describing The Doctor's 11th incarnation. Most potently, she hits the nail on the head when she says 'Next stop, everywhere!' With Matt Smith/Moffat, it feels like Doctor Who has gotten back to the feel of adventure and excitement. When the TARDIS doors open, you never know what's going to be on the other side. And there was always something exciting happening.

With RTD I always felt like there was just too much focus on the love relationship between The Doctor and his companions, and especially their home lives. It would feel like just as The Doctor was getting ready to go on an adventure, we'd have episodes like Aliens of London, Turn Left, Love and Monsters, etc. that focused on the home lives of the companions, instead of exploring some ~~rock quarry~~ alien planet out in the cosmos.

That's about the best way I've come to think that I can describe it. The sense of adventure just wasn't there. Well, it was there, but it would flicker in the wind as companions would constantly want to visit their home life or flirt with The Doctor when there was all of Time and Space to explore. And such a focus was never really prominent in the classic series, either. We might be visiting our millionth rock quarry, but damnit, at least they tried! Which episodes like God Complex also remind me of. It's like Moffat was saving money to do the Wedding of River Song, so he asked to film in a rock quarry, got denied, and then ran out and rented every room in a hotel and said,""Ok, this is going to be an alien spaceship!' and by George, we all believed it!

It's that kind of magic where the entire episode can be filmed inside a hotel, and you still feel so pulled in that you really believe it is an alien spaceship/prison floating around somewhere in space.

&gt;You know when you see a photograph of someone you know but it's from years before you knew them? It's like they're not quite... finished. They're not done yet. Well, yes, the Doctor's here. He came when I called, just like he always does. But not my Doctor. Now, my Doctor... I've seen whole armies turn and run away and he'd just swagger off back to his TARDIS and open the doors with a snap of his fingers. The Doctor in the TARDIS. Next stop, everywhere.

* No. We are Liverpool: we should control most of the drama within our grasp. Rodgers has done very well so far. But the Andy Carroll thing is not as controlled, as say the Suarez contract renewal situation was, or the Agger situation is. We hear lots of speculations about Agger, and even Skrtel at one point,  but not much specifics, where-else with Carroll, it just doesn't feel as controlled.

true,LORDJEW_VAN_CUNTFUCK,smith,Smith,"Paradoxes can be fun and clever but they can also be horrible and cheap writing. Having you say ""I wish there were motr parodoxes!"" is like seeing somebody say ""This show needs more deus ex machina"" or ""If only there were *more* cliches"". That's why I was so confused at your other comment because it basically reads, to me, ""I like bad writing!""

The paradoxes in Blink were clever and fresh and completely okay. But it's odd that you cite Season 5's finale as another good one because that's probably one of Moffat's most blatant ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" uses of the paradox.

[](#s ""The entire first episode surrounded this mysterious box. It is then revealed that hundreds and hundreds of the Doctor's greatest enemies, smart intelligent antagonists that he has messed with in the past, has somehow gone against all odds and formed an alliance. Formed an alliance to trap him in impenetrable, infallible, prison. They force him in there and he's yelling and it's closing and it's a very dramatic and nice cliffhanger to the episode."")

[](#s ""And then in the next episode all that is undone with a stupid paradox. Never mind the fact that this amazing ancient prison is openable with a simple sonic screwdriver (Which *all* of his enemies know The Doctor uses), the Doctor travels in time, gives Rory the screwdriver, Rory opens the pandorica, which releases the Doctor giving him the ability to give Rory the screwdriver in the first place. Completely fucking stupid and frankly, an insult to the viewers. You don't build up this massive suspenseful cliffhanger in a two-parter season finale only to solve it with a cheap and impossible paradox."")",0,1344414240,null,0,false,0,c5pwsdd,t3_xsww7,t1_c5pwsdd,t1_c5pjfds,null,1429582446,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Remember, this is the woman who ran off with The Doctor so she could prolong her wedding day to making the decision in Amy's Choice that risked killing herself to get to live with Rory again.

Those bikes might have a logo on them but they are every bit as tailored in fit to those riders as the GB ones are.  Same goes for TdF bikes...which in the days of steel frames were frequently nothing to do with the manufacturer whose logo ended up painted on them (sponsorship money determined branding, cyclist determined who actually built his frame).  

The point about GB's recent success is that one change such as aero work or designing your own bikes does not make a significant difference, so people pinning it on ""magic"" kit just aren't getting it.  At this point you could give everyone the same bike package and the results would largely remain the same.  The winning margins are the cumulative effect of improving every single area, no matter how small, that affects a cyclist's performance.  Throughout most of this Olympics, GB's riders and coaches have been the only ones using heated shorts between races, the only ones analysing their races in such microscopic detail, the only ones doing certain kinds of training, the only ones thinking about what they need from a bike enough to want to design their own.  Hell, Chris Hoy was the only rider who bothered wearing an aerodynamic helmet for his final yesterday.  I'm sure the other riders thought it was pointless, and it probably had little or no effect on its own, but doing absolutely every single thing that could help your performance is a mindset that now runs through GB cycling like a stick of rock thanks to Dave Brailsford, and it's that attitude the other countries should be looking at, not magic bikes.",0,1344415392,null,0,false,0,c5pwxe4,t3_xtvwn,t1_c5pwxe4,t1_c5pq113,null,1429582512,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You make it out to be a bad thing but the reality is that most of these people come to get apprenticeships have very little job prospects. I sifted through 100s of applications a week from people with 2-3 GCSEs at E and F grades that would have no way of getting a job in the real market. An apprenticeship not only gets them a job, it gives them a legit qualification and gets a foot on the career ladder. I can't speak for Farmfoods but even though the advertised rate is usually £2.60 an hour, many companies will pay apprentices a decent working wage if the apprentice works hard and takes the job seriously.

What is wrong however is to criminalise companies like Farmfoods for offering someone that is other unemployable an opportunity to get into work and get on track with life.

1. Chelsea finished 5th last season. Tottenham finished 4th.

2. Tottenham has a new manager, and Chelsea have a manager with a big question mark next to his name.

3. Tottenham have a high chance of losing modric this window, Arsenal of losing RVP, Chelsea have lost Drogba. Imagine what last year's premier league would've looked like without those three talismans.

4. Chelsea and Arsenal finished incredibly strongly in the last few months. Up until about February-March they looked on par with Liverpool, and far worse than Newcastle/Tottenham.

5. Man Utd have thus far made one first-team signing. At the same time they've haemorrhaged ANOTHER midfielder (in park) and time has ticked over one further year for giggs and scholes. Unless Ferguson is going to play a 5-0-5,  their squad is looking as threadbare as it ever has in the past 20 years. 

6. Last season was probably the most exciting and one of the most open in the premier league history. Coming into the new season, we are clearly in the decline and fall of the top four with no definitive successors. Chelsea, Arsenal and Man Utd (and Liverpool) easily have close to their weakest squads of the past decade. They are assured of nothing.

7. Only Man City can boast stability, having retained all their stars and counting on consolidating on last years triumphs. But keep in mind they tried their hardest to lose the premier league at the end of last season, they will undoubtedly emphasise the champions league this season, and history has taught us that the success of previous flash-in-the-pain galacticos has been fleeting (leeds, lazio et al).

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Apprenticeships have always varied greatly, both in terms of the qualifications on offer, the job prospects at the end, and the salary.

I did an AMA [Advanced Modern Apprenticeship] in I.T, during which I studied NVQ Level 2 Customer Service, and NVQ Level 2, Level 3, Using I.T. At no point did I have to contribute towards the cost - in fact, I was paid a little over £14k a year during my apprenticeship. Once I'd ""qualified"" I was given a full time job, at the bottom of the regular salary ladder, and eventually went onto study a HND in Computer Sciences, before burning out, and completely changing career paths.

Most people would argue that the apprenticeship I did was a text book example of how they should be run - taking school leavers who could demonstrate a desire to learn more about a field that they want to pursue as a career, and offering them training - both on the job, and in the classroom, that would allow them to fulfil their potential.

Indeed, if memory serves, over 1,000 people applied for the ten apprenticeships that were on offer.

This was the selection process:

* Complete a full application form, downloaded from the internet.
* Attach any qualifications already achieved / certificates of achievement.
* Write a personal profile [minimum 2,000 words].
* Include documentation from your school, that indicated your predicted grades at GCSE.

If you were selected, based on the above, you were invited into the local college. Once there, applicants underwent the following:

* Advanced English / Maths testing.
* Microsoft Word / Excel test - if memory serves it was take the details from an excel document, and mail merge into Word, to generate a series of letters.
* Typing Proficiency test.

If you passed through that process, you were invited back again for a 1-2-1 interview with HR, and senior members of staff.

They had to advertise the position[s] again, as only myself and 4 others got through the entire process.

Now, in terms of the job itself? Within a year of starting [i.e. at which point I had two years left of ""training""] I was lasing with members of staff to produce content that would be taught to students my age. I was also doing extensive project management, and programming in PHP.

None of which, was taught during my ""lessons.""

Part of the reason I mention it, is that there were people in our lessons who were getting ~£70 a week [or whatever the appreticeship rate was back then] and who were doing very basic I.T jobs [basic hardware repair / installation etc, etc.]

So, should you start yelling stuff about immigrants in my vicinity then I am perfectly within my right to find what you're saying to be offensive and to take issue with you. What I cannot do is claim to support freedom of speech which demanding that you be prevented from exercising your right to free speech on the basis that I find your speech to be offensive. And quite often you will find that the right-on-man lefty crowd do actually hold this view and cannot see why it might be a problem.

In this case the argument is being made that if one set of people should have a right to their freedom of expression being protected, in the way that their political views and activities should not be held against them when seeking employment, then there is an argument to extend this to other people. The issue being pointed out is that some of the papers who consider the blacklist to be a problem are the same papers who tried to insist that people who held political views they didn't like should be put on a blacklist.

One thing I do have to point out is that not everyone who agrees with the BNP or supports the party is some terrible violent racist who hates everyone who isn't English. There are people like that in the party or who support the party of course, but it's not everyone. The party itself actually runs on a platform of little Englander mentality combined with a large amount of [rather trite] socialism - they seem to want to nationalize a great deal of things for instance. And as such actually has support from people who have legitimate concerns about immigration but have found that quite often expressing these concerns will get them branded as a racist. And if we ignore the concerns people hold about immigration then we're left with a situation where the only people who engage with them are actual racists.

However, though I'm not saying people should be exempt from certain lines of employment based on their political beliefs, I do think there should be at least some caution.

I think it's not so unjust to say that believing in right-wing politics (if they are indeed a racist) could potentially affect their performance as good teacher or police officer. I.e. prejudice and discrimination in the class-room or when arresting people; racism and being a copper has never been a good mix. But of course, freedom of speech is important for a free society, and though I don't in any way agree with racism, fascism and nationalism, I'll defend their rights to express their views.

They kept that red herring going all the way up to A Good Man Goes to War in which, to the audience, it seems like Amy is describing The Doctor to baby Melody, and how he'll rescue them, when it turns out that she's talking about Rory the whole time.

For better or worse, the show has permanently changed in certain regards, and I agree, I don't think we'll ever see certain aspects again with the main show.

I think a large part of the charm, though, came from its history. Back in 1963 England there were like 3 channels on TV, and it didn't take much to have an interesting show. Old British broadcasting is even made fun of in American culture as being drab and boring. So the crew to Doctor Who had license to do pretty much whatever they wanted, hire whatever kind of actors, etc. because there wasn't a whole lot else that was better than it at the time.

Now though, especially since it's beginning to compete on an international level, the writers and producers will do as much as they can to adhere to the audience they've gained over the last 7 years, and part of that is having the young, quirky, good looking Doctor in a fast paced and exciting 45 minute episode.",0,1344423806,null,0,false,0,c5pxrmf,t3_xv8to,t1_c5pxrmf,t1_c5pxq4g,null,1429582993,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Even before they changed the default sub reddits to what they are now;

http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html

The focus shifted away from news with the introduction of the sub reddit system over 4 years ago.

If you log out right now and check the [default front page](http://i.imgur.com/7UmVe.png), there's barely any news there at all. And the default front page is what you have to judge reddit by, because your reddit is far different than my reddit, but the default set is what *everyone* sees while not logged in and when they first register.

So how busy are some of the defaults? Well according to some [recent statistics from Askreddit](http://i.imgur.com/nmqJG.png), they had just over 10million uniques in July yet only have 2,018,004 subscribers. So that's 5 times as many people viewing the sub reddit than actually subscribed.

So back to eh original question of how many people who use it as a news service? Not many.

You could say this about fizzy Haribos. 


Rejecting the combined vaccine is, as far as I'm concerned, a form of child abuse that has slipped through various legal cracks and become a protected act. It harms everyone, not just the unvaccinated child, and should be utterly condemned and any non-scientific advocacy of it suppressed.


Edit: Whilst I personally think that any advocacy of rejecting the jab as an end conclusion should be banned (not academic or political discussion of it, but any kind of suggestion of what to do directly to parents), the article is a bit unclear as to why the ASA were involved.

If you go to the site, you'll see that the site offers **private medical services**, chief amongst them the individual M. M. R. shots. 

The ASA got involved because the site was ginning up the autism link so it could profiteer from worried or paranoid parents.

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;If you are 20 years old and you're still only applying for unskilled jobs such as Farmfoods at apprentice level, you're basically unemployable. By the age of 20, if you've not been in university you should be well on your way.

You're making ridiculous assumptions about the people applying for these jobs. There is little choice in the matter for some. The current employment market is dire. For those with poor qualifications stuff like retail, call centres and door-to-door sales are the only routes available (and even for some graduates now..). Not everyone is university bound. We will *always* have menial workers. Not to mention that these are the sort of roles that those with learning difficulties are placed in.

&gt;And yes, I was a lorry driver in a past life. Your point?

Not exactly the dizzy heights of achievement - to me it just sounds a bit hypocritical of someone who worked a low status role berating others in similarly low status roles as 'shit'.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Not that i'm saying it is MMR but it is almost certainly environmental. 

[That's certainly not true](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15858952?dopt=Abstract). [Autism is either genetic or has prenatal causes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_autism) (You'll notice that the postnatal hypothesis are noted to be anecdotal or poorly sourced). Children can be screened for it by 18 months of age via psycological tests, and it's also possible to run genetic and brain scans to detect the condition. There is nothing more than anecdotal evidence that autism has any environmental factors. Until there is actually any evidence against it, It's safe to say that everyone with autism is born with it.

Firstly, if you want to save your time reading the next few paragraphs while I attempt to correlate what I've read about the subject, then here's the biggest clue that the MMR/Autism link is a scam:

The MMR scare was started by a man named Andrew Wakefield, who was subsequently struck off by the GMC, his article on the subject debunked and rejected by the Lancet due to fabrication of data, and his ethics were questioned that he was possibly receiving money from lawyers involved in MMR-related court cases. [Rational Wiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) has a nice little article on the man. If you still want to believe his claims, then read on while I try to debunk them even further.

Autism wasn't really known of until about 1996, at which point diagnoses have been shooting up year after year - One explanation is that doctors are either getting better at it, or misdiagnosing other psychological problems. Wikipedia has a [nice graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US-autism-6-17-1996-2007.png) showing the near-geometric increase of cases in the following years. For comparison, how many people were diagnosed with Schizophrenia *before schizophrenia was defined*? Those poor people were just written off as crazy or weird.

The MMR vaccine was introduced in the 1970s, so if it were the cause of autism, you would have expected the disease to be picked up and more prevalent long before 1996. As that's not the case, I don't really see how MMR could be considered as a cause for Autism.

Additionally, in the States where this whole thing kicked off, remember that healthcare is a massive, profitable industry. Without trying to sound too conspiracy nutcase, doctors are under pressure from pharmaceutical companies to promote and sell their latest drugs. Parents also tend to get panicky if baby doesn't cry as much as usual or doesn't play well with friends, and there is very much a culture of attaching psychological diagnoses to children who just have unique personalities. How many kids in the states on Ritalin do you actually think have ADHD, and how many of them just have parents that *think* they have it?

**Edit: Rewording, moved a few paragraphs around, I'll probably be back with more sources, but mostly it's wikipedia at the moment**

The loyalty fee, if I'm not mistaken, gets paid when a new contract is signed or a player is sold without a transfer request being lodged - thus, Meireles would have been persuaded to accept a lower deal for the first year while we struggled to sell the club and avoid the banks, with the promise of a shiny new contract with much higher wages and a sizeable loyalty fee to go with it.

The new owners obviously didn't want to give Meireles the new contract he was after, and at that point he was always going to leave, and once AVB was interested he was always going to go to Chelsea.

Diagnosing the condition is not an exact science.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're right in there certainly needs to be an explanation for the sharp increase of cases from the mid-90s, and I really feel that, given the sudden media boost Autism and other illnesses on that spectrum such as Aspergers, awareness is likely to be one of the contributing factors. Remember, we're talking about *parents* here. 

If the world starts telling you that if your child is antisocial or shy then they might be seriously psychologically ill then you'll feel more compelled to get it looked at.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all - I have trust that such awareness has resulted in many thousands of children getting the help they need when previously the parents or teachers would have written it off as a personality thing, but this media hype seems to be the only thing that coincides with the increase of diagnoses.

A nice little illustration of the hype can be seen on [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/?q=autism) - You'll notice really quite noticeable spikes in people searching for the term 'Autism' around articles published about claims of potential causes. You'll also notice a steady increase in news-site articles per year on the subject.

The media effect is even more noticeable with [Aspergers](http://www.google.com/trends/?q=aspergers). Note the correlation between media reports and search popularity.

Of course, please don't take those statistical analyses as any kind of evidence, there are doubtlessly confounding factors involved that are skewing those numbers but I feel that it's a good representation on the effect media reporting has on public awareness.

The cause is still very much up for debate, but there's something really strange about how many different hypothesis there are, and how many of those are untested, speculation or anecdotal.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"He makes a good point; you're using a faily old definition of what an apprentice is.

The traditional appretiship was to train people in the sort of physical skills that school was considered unsuitable for. They weren’t really paid much either, but out of that you were expected to purchase all your own kit (tools, precision measurement equipment, etc).

The modern apprentiship is mostly aimed at addressing the chronic problem of so many of our youngsters finishing highschool with the system having failed to make them employable. You might consider these retail positions insulting in wage and utterly beneath you, but consider for a moment that they probably aren't intended for you (we have a wide range of unemployed right now).

If you finish schooling with sub-C grades in English and Math, what employment prospects do you realisticly have in a jobs market like this, with no qualifications and no job history?

So either you leave such people to languish on jobseekers ad infinitum, or you try to encorage businesses to take them on and develop them to an employable level. Now businesses aren't charities; they've got no reason to want to fix societies problems or solve the failiure of the school system. If you want them to spend the time and money required to develop these people (and yes, you might not consider retail to be a very advanced skill, but it is still a skill and all skills require training), you've got to make it worth their while to employ a poorer range of people then they'd otherwise snap up.

So the businesses get cheap labour, while the employees get marketable skills and a job history. The apprentise stays in the position for a few months; long enough to build up an employment history that will demonstrate the right things to future employers, and then moves on so the position can be taken up by someone else.

Try to think of it as subsidised training rather then employment; plus £2.60/hr is almost twice what you'd get on jobseekers while still being low enough to avoid the tax thresholds.",0,1344428301,null,0,false,0,c5py9k7,t3_xvgc0,t1_c5py9k7,t1_c5pxip0,null,1429583229,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"Well here's something for you to think about; if you commute by bicycle, the chances are you'll live to be healthier for longer.

It's easy for me since I've been cycling on the roads since I was 16 (24 years ago, sadface), but you just have to be aware of your surroundings and try and be predictable.  That means cycling at least 1 metre from the kerb.  On a carriageway with two or more lanes, you cycle in the centre of the left-hand lane and bollocks to any motorists who don't like it.  If you're going around a roundabout, you take the centre of the lane you need - don't cycle around the outside, you'll get wiped out.  At pinch points (pedestrian islands), take the whole lane so motorists can't overtake you.  Do the same on narrow country lanes, make it so motorists have to give serious thought about overtaking you rather than just ""squeezing past"" without a care in the world.

Be confident, be assertive.  Don't take silly risks, don't slip up the inside of large vehicles (that's how most cyclists are killed), don't assume that you're invulnerable and that a motorist has seen you.  Give other road users friendly signals, for instance, if a motorist has waited for you to clear a hazard, give him a friendly wave - many motorists will reciprocate.

If someone cuts you up (there's always one), try not to get into an argument with them if you catch them up - just be nice and ask for more room next time.  If they give you shit, blow them a kiss, it confuses them.

Youtube cycle cameras tend only to show the worst instances of driving, but on my daily 90min+ ride I encounter only about 2-3 careless drivers out of thousands.  In all my years of riding I've been knocked off twice, at low speed.

Never be trapped into thinking that cars have more ""rights"" over the road than you. If you're even the slightest bit concerned of someone dangerously overtaking you ride out to a position that makes it practically impossible for them to do so in. Drivers might get pissed off at you but who cares; they want to drive fast, you want them to drive safe. I use this tactic with oncoming traffic in single lanes, or where a car is parked a few hundred yards away and I don't want to get boxed in.

Watch out for ipod zombies; apparently walking in a straight line is a difficult task for many pedestrians, they can wave in front of you at any time and shouting at the top of your lungs rarely works. On this note, never wear headphones; slow pokes on shit mountain bikes listening to music and weaving all over the place is about the most annoying thing a road cyclist faces (that isn't life threatening).

Never jump red lights at junctions, it gives cyclists a bad rep aside from being incredibly dangerous. I must admit that at some pedestrian crossings I've done it because I've not liked the situation; I'm not proud of it mind you. 

Never use the bits at the side of the roundabouts for cyclists, get in the middle of the correct lane so cars can't cut you up. Almost never overtake a truck or if you're not certain you can get passed it. A lot of advice tells you that ""Overtake on the right hand side because then the drivers can see you in their mirrors for longer"" which is true for buses but a decent percentage of lorries are right hand drive because of long haulage to Europe - its impossible to tell which it is from the back (unless your some kind of truck expert or something), they have blind spots that are fucking huge.

Confidence is the key, if you make no decision that's often worse than making the wrong one; don't find yourself sitting in a position that leaves you vulnerable.

Lastly, It's tempting to swear at drivers when they behave like wankers, don't bother some of them thrive on it. If they really piss you off try and follow them or take their plate in case you find them again; if they stop in a car park you can then calmly inform them of their erroneous behaviour when they don't have the power trip of their big steal death boxes. This scares the shit out of short guys and women in big cars and you don't even have to raise your voice.

&gt; I think the Times’ campaign is an excellent campaign. I strongly support what they’re trying to do. **Anyone who’s got on a bicycle – particularly in one of our busier cities – knows that you are taking your life into your hands every time you do so**. And so we do need to do more to try and make cycling safer. The government is making it easier for councils to install mirrors at junctions. We’re putting 11 million pounds into training for children, and **15 million pounds for better cycle routes and facilities across the country.** I think if we want to encourage the growth in cycling we’ve seen in recent years, we need to get behind campaigns like this.

£15 million is nothing, it's impossible to create any sort of valid improvements ""across the country"" with such a insulting amount.

So we all have to lobby, email, phone and keep at it along side direct action until things are improved.  We're a tiny country which lots of money, if several other countries in Europe can do it, so can we.

I wish councils would stop wasting money by painting tiny lanes or ASLs where they're not needed and go and hire someone from Europe that knows what they're doing.

People moan about groups like Critical Mass (I'm not surprised, there's a lot of dickheads in those kind of rides) but I understand their frustration, but the only way to get good facilities when there's nobody with the power or money lobbying, is ""direct action"".

It annoys me no end that there is not more of a push for good cycling infrastructure.

Just recently I want to a local council meeting regarding a 21 mile distributor road that would be (if built) passing around the back of my village. The reason they need this road is because there are currently too many cars on the road! My heart sank when they said this...

Around cities and towns (I live 4 miles outside a city) we have the opportunity to get cars off the roads, make people fitter and generally improve everyone's life - and all it takes is a bit of forethought. We need cycle lanes and better public transport. Building more roads for (mostly) single occupancy car drivers is stupid and irresponsible for future generations.

But I digress.....I asked the local counsel planner is there would be any inclusion of cycle paths...confusion and worry appear on her face, she then proceeded to point at about 5 small stretches of road that would include cycle lanes. I was far from impressed. The lanes really did nothing, and at best was a token gesture to appease some legal requirement.

Obviously the meat comes from the US, although as you seem to concede, it was very popular in the UK, particularly in WW2 and in the subsequent austerity of the latter half of the twentieth century.  It was at the top of school dinner menus throughout the 60s and 70s. Because of this, it has a strong cultural connection to the UK, unlike Oreos.  Although it originated in the US, people in Britain see Spam as a British food because of its history:

http://hungryhouse.co.uk/blog/the-many-delights-of-british-cuisine/

This is about as far from Oreos and M&amp;Ms as you can get!  What an odd reference.

I doubt most people in the latter half of the 20th Century even realised it originated in the US.  The Monty Python sketch is a part this, and the use to describe email comes via them.  It may have solely US connotations in your mind, but that is because you seem entirely cut off and ignorant of the prominent position of Spam in Britain's cultural heritage.  To describe it as ""some kind of an American food"" when your forebears literally grew up on this stuff is just lack of knowledge. It is a personal misunderstanding, not grounded in reality. Such ignorance would have been inconceivable a generation ago. There is even a Scottish term ""Spam Valley"" to describe low cost housing.  I definitely remember Spam in the 80s, not least the habit of school kids to find someone with a large forehead, slap their palm on it and shout spam at the top of their voice.

 We're seeing it in F1 with resource restriction agreements, and FIFA are introducing financial fair play. Ultimately the Olympics, once championed as the games for minority/amateur sports has to also follow suit, if anything it should have been the leader in cutting the costs of it all. The Olympics, in general, have just become far too expensive. Governments throw too much money at them for very little return on investment, apart from 'prestige' gained from gold medals.

There needs to be financial reform, because it's in the interests of the IOC to keep the costs down.

I disagree. If FSG's tenure as part owners of the Red Sox is anything to go by, I'd say their strategy is more of a ""draft and develop talent young (academy) or buy young players from others, supplemented by veterans when needed, with value stressed overall."" They then hold these players until they are no longer productive or until a younger, less expensive player is ready to take over.

EDIT: I should add that even when the Sox traded Youk, the sox long time, high producing first baseman and fan favorite, it was only because there was an excellent young third baseman coming up through the minor leagues (like the academy for non-baseball followers) to replace him with better production.

Its not a legal requirement for cyclists to use cycle lanes.

It can be dangerous to use cycle lanes, especially if they are shared with the public.

cycle lanes unlike roads are sometimes covered in rubbish and are in a state of disrepair - road bikes especially need a surface in good condition.

Cycle lanes sometimes don't lead where the cyclist wants to go (this is my biggest issue) 

Cycle lanes often just stop - meaning a cyclist has to enter a road of traffic.

If a cyclist has a £1500 bike there is every chance he can keep up with the traffic, and would be cycling faster than a cycle lane would allow

But I do sympathise, taking the above into account -  if its there, and its usable, and its going in the direction they want to go in I see no reason not to use it.

In some circumstances the bike lanes are poorly maintained, so give a *very* rough ride, this is more noticeable on the faster racing-type bikes because they are generally stiffer and have thinner/harder tyres - hence why the preference for the (slightly) smoother tarmac. As an analogy, imagine if you were on a dual carriageway where the left lane was cobbled, and the right was normal tarmac, you'd choose the tarmac to drive on wouldn't you?


Also, the bike lanes can become filled with general road debris such as stones, broken glass and often small pieces of metal rubbish. These are swept of the main carriageway by cars/vans/lorries and accumulate in the bike lane.

I'm glad that Andy is being given a fair run at it and I would love for him to get at least a season under BR to try and perfect his touch and short passing. There's never been any doubt about Andy's physical presence and natural ability but I maybe a manager like BR is what he needs to bring his game tithe next level and become a ""complete striker"", similar to Ibra. 

Agger is a player we MUST hang onto. Aside from Kelly if he got moved to CB, Agger is our only central defender that has real composure on the ball and it's going to be key with our new style that we are able to pass the ball out of the defensive end and not boot it every time (no offense to Carra). 

Hell, a few key signings and this team could be real title contenders in a couple years. We have a lot of young talent and I truly believe this club is headed in the right direction.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Honestly, I think Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead is my favorite Tennant story. Largely due to two facts. For starters, it really feels like Moffat is playing with everything that has been established as the tenth Doctor. Such as when the 'explorers' first show up in the library, and he does his typical 'I'm going to yell until you do what I say!' bit, and they just stare at him like he was a yipping Chihuahua. Moffat did a great job, I think, in highlighting the literary flaws built up around the Tenth Doctor, but then still lets them play out in the story itself without it seeming like he's overly criticizing Tennant/RTD.

Second reason is that I actually like Donna in the episode, and liked that she got a very good, yet still sci-fi, side story based around her. Separating her like Moffat did gave her a chance to shine as a companion without worrying about living in the shadows of Rose. And I know I'm in the minority here, but I feel like her ending in this episode was far sadder than her ultimate fate.

He even told Wilfred that it doesn't matter if he is out of regenerations, he can still die. He says even regenerations feel like dying because a whole new man takes his place: new body AND new personality as we learned in The Christmas Invasion. It is not that there will never be a Doctor as good as him, he just doesn't want to change. And he actually did sacrifice himself for his companion: Wilfred. Wilfred even told him not to but he did anyway.

Watch The End of Time and you will see that the Doctor basically did not change.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"I think Andy will stay. Agger will only go if a good offer from Bayern or Barca comes in. Brad Jones is looking to be leaving for Norwich. Everyone else will most likely stay (yes that includes Cole and Adam) except for a loan here or there (mainly Shelvers and Sterling).

I don't think Ramirez will come to Anfield this season unless he's in a Spurs shirt. I think we've faked interest in Ramirez enough that Spurs are actually willing to dish out the money Bologna have asked for him, which means they'll hopefully go after our other targets less. Dempsey really wants to be an LFC player. Rodgers wants him to be an LFC player, but Fulham's asking price is too high (10m+) and the deal is nearly dead.

I think we'll be getting Tello on a perm move (with a buy back clause for Barca). He's looking for first team football which he won't get at Barca. There's also a good chance for Afellay on loan. Sahin will also most likely come on loan (especially if Song stays at Arsenal). All of these players would kill for first team football, which they would almost definitely get at LFC. I think a move is being made for Kevin Mirallas (Belgian striker at Olympiacos). He's scored 34 goals in 52 appearances for them so is a pretty solid player but would also be relatively cheap.

Lastly, I'm almost certain that Allen will be an LFC player by the end of next week. It won't be the 20m+ rumour that's been going around but most likely around 12m + Sterling or Shelvey on loan. Oh and Dorus De Vries (Wolves backup keeper) will be coming in to be our backup keeper.

**TLDR**; 

Out: Jones, maybe Agger, Shelvey and Sterling on loan

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"As a senior engineer who trains (what are in your parlance) ‘semi-skilled’ technicians I fail to see a practical distinction in what you’re saying; it’s entirely arbitrary and rather old-fashioned to label one thing a ‘domain-specific skill’ and another thing ‘training’. 

The vast majority of what our factory staff learn would be classified as transferable skill-sets. We don’t employ someone because they’ve got, say, a vast domain-specific understanding of processing rubbers which they’ve learnt in an accredited apprenticeship. We look for people with experience working in factory (or fabrication) environments, who can demonstrate good English and numeracy, who have experience with typical SHE requirements (as I listed above), who can demonstrate attention to detail and the ability to accurately follow process specifications and (of course) properly document their work.

That’s all you need. It’s better if you have more, of course, and we’ll always take those with more if we can find them. But that is the basic set of transferable skills we need to see on a technicians CV before we’d consider them for interview; it’s more important to be able to demonstrate the ability to learn then it is to demonstrate specific technical skills and knowledge (those we can give you as needed). 

This idea that apprenticeships need to be about learning specific trade skills (like plumbing) is so antiquated it’s almost Victorian. Development and training practises have moved on; these days it’s about proving a basic level of competence in a given field and developing a transferable skill-set.

Is Bellamy going to stay? Is Carroll good enough to stay? Who are we bringing in? Why *aren't* we bringing anyone else in??

My positives:

1. FSG and Rodgers - We finally have some solid ownership, we have a young and passionate manager in Rodgers who has seemingly said all the right things so far and is bringing exciting tactics to Liverpool.

2. Gerrard is entering the season fit, Lucas is recovering very quickly and appears to be fit enough to start the season, Suarez shouldn't miss eight matches in the middle of the season for *any* reason.

3. I've mentioned this many times in this sub before but I truly believe that the much maligned group of Stewart Downing, Jordan Henderson, Charlie Adam, and Andy Carroll surely could not perform any worse than they did last season (frankly, Adam and Henderson weren't as bad as some may remember). Most of these guys seemed to be anonymous for large chunks of the season or in any given match but with some improvement and some consistent play, they'll feel like 'new transfers.'

Again though, even if I increased the target to £2million, I would never see a penny of it. No possible way for me to scam people with this.

Third: for context I can't do better than that wordpress page. It all took place on twitter, and the blog has screengrabs of his tweets which explain the background. I didn't write the blog (and I'm not sure I know the person who did). I'm not an official fund raiser or in any group, I am just an individual who was annoyed by something. There's not a lot more context I can give other than that!!

and lastly, addressing the point of him not doing any damage, I personally think he is. He is guilt tripping the athletes. He is a multi-millionaire who is making a charitable donation conditional on people complying with his narrow definition of Britishness. I agree the charity getting money is great, I'm just helping to make his donation as great as it would have been if he weren't such a massive twat...

1) Levy promised last year to let him go, but broke his promise (source: Redknapp). This shouldn’t happen for a high profile manager like Levy is.

2) Modric is a foreign player. He doesn't owe any of the allegiance to the spurs whatsoever. He has been bought, used and should be sold. This is a part where lots of fans gets angry and starts to hate player if he shows his disloyalty, but they are forgetting that he is there to play for money, not for their love. Maybe he already has a club in his heart to which he wants to return sometime in future. And it can't be two favorite clubs, we all know that :).

3) He wants to leave. He really wants to leave. Would you liked to stay at a job triple less paid just because you have a contract? Football business shouldn't be slavery, just like none of the other work places.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Re: ""Gentleman's agreement"" - Modric has been in the game long enough to know that if you don't get it in writing, it's worth nothing. Normally I could sympathize with his situation, but he signed a 6 year contract in 2010 and then tried to get out of it less than a year into it. If he put so much stock in the gentleman's agreement, then he needs to fire his agent, because that was an incredibly naive move. Most other players are aware of this. That's why they have buyout clauses, to avoid this. 

As far as allegiance goes, none of us have any doubts whatsoever about Modric's loyalty. We know it doesn't lie with Spurs, and we don't expect it to. Certainly it's nice when players latch on to the club (see: Van der Vaart), and the fans certainly respond to that, but it's not expected, not in this day and age. Personally, the only allegiance I expect is to his contract. He's a professional. He's making several million pounds per year. Which goes into point number three you made. He's under contract. It's not slavery. In any other business on earth, for every other person, if someone signs a contract of which they know full well the duration, they are expected to honor it, and it is generally seen as a negative thing if they don't. Why should footballers be any different? He wants out? Then he should be cooperating, not throwing tantrums and refusing to go on tour, or to practice. In the long run, the only person he's hurting in that case is himself. Levy won't budge from his valuation, as well he shouldn't. Levy's interests are the well-being of the club, not the well-being of Modric. If we shouldn't expect any loyalty from Modric, then Modric also shouldn't expect Levy to put his own interests ahead of the club's. The fact of the matter is, Levy has Modric's price set in his mind. He even offered a lower price than that to Madrid initially, when the alternative was for him to go to Chelsea. They wanted to haggle from that price instead, and then Modric decided to go on strike, which meant to them that our bargaining position was weakened so they decided to go even lower than that, and it might have worked, had Chelsea not brought Oscar in. But they did, and that brought the asking price back to Levy's valuation, while Madrid seem to still be convinced that Modric's value is lower due to him wanting to leave. Comparing it to slavery is absolutely laughable and frankly insulting to the conditions people lived in in actual slavery. Luka's not a child, and I'm assuming he was aware how far away 2016 was when he signed. If he didn't sign that contract and left on a free, I know I, personally, wouldn't hold it against him because he'd fulfilled his obligations. But he signed that contract and then decides he wants to make 6 million pounds per year instead of 2 million? Not feeling it, really.

Levy's been negotiating, so he's willing to sell. That much is true. Modric is an incredibly good player, and they don't go for cheap. Madrid refuse to meet the price, and Chelsea don't need him anymore, so what option does he have now? Levy's not going to let the club get screwed just because of a supposed agreement with Modric, the fact that Madrid haven't come close to meeting the price is their fault entirely.",0,1344444269,null,0,false,0,c5q1tv2,t3_xvr5a,t1_c5q1tv2,t1_c5q1ak5,null,1429584913,21,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,21

The evidence shows less men get killed by left turning vehicles because they push forward more, skip more lights and generally are more pushy and law breaking than female cyclists.

An area of Paris is making it legal for cyclists to skip red lights when they deem it to be safe (and accept they do not have right of way etc). I think this law would be sensible to introduce in the UK assuming it goes well enough over there (it happens here now just illegally). As well as maybe some stuff allowing a bit more flexibility for bike to jump onto and use pavements in certain circumstances.

Really we do need both better driver awareness (and it may be me but I think they've got better a little) and a better cycling network infrastructure that is really joined up, no pointless cycle lanes on really wide roads that are basically unused by cyclists because the roads are too dangerous either side or are not able to be used by cyclists, or ones that just stop dead somewhere etc etc",0,1344444798,null,0,1344445013,0,c5q1zfu,t3_xvjex,t1_c5q1zfu,t1_c5pydei,null,1429584972,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

true,MiniPenguino,lfc99,,"Why are we still talking about Allen? I do not think that he is a good enough player for Liverpool. He is a player that has been brought up through the Swansea ranks and has only had one season of Premier League experience. 

Allen plays well in Rodger's system, but what does that mean if Rodger's doesn't do well and is canned by next season or in two? We have an average player that does well in a tiki-taka style of play. 

Also, the fact that Laudrup wants more than 20 Million Pounds for him should be an indicator that we need to back off. We can't be putting in these super high transfer bids for players that may or may not work out. Carroll is a big indicator of this. He has played decently so far, but for the majority of his LFC career he has not done well. 

I honestly think that the squad is good as it is. If Rodgers is able to bring in Sahin on loan, fucking awesome. Maybe even a permanent deal clause in the contract would help bring in a great player. But I think Downing will do a lot better this season and Sterling is going to be his replacement in a few years so there is no need to buy a left winger. 

Dempsey could do well on the right wing, but I seem him a lot as a squad player or as an impact sub. Cole is also there to give some competition on the right wing and seeing as nobody wanted to pick him up or his huge wages, we should at least try and use what we have and save the money for next time. 

TL:DR; Buying Allen is a waste of money, Dempsey is meh, the squad is solid, save money.

Historically marriage in Scotland and marriage in rUK have been very different due to the different legal systems and different churchs. The famous example of this is the age at which you can get married. It is sixteen in Scotland and eighteen in rUK. 

The Scottish Executive was designed to allow flexibility, speed and efficiency on designing, debating and implementing Scottish bills. That is why the smoking ban was passed in Scotland first and also the hunting ban. Now it is gay marriage and minimum alcohol pricing.

true,unwind-protect,cnty-uk,Cambridgeshire,"&gt; it's like they think they're too special to have to use the cycle lane

And presumably you think you're too special to let them use the road? ;-)

Here's some reasons:

* Cycle lanes (painted on roads) often simply aren't wide enough to allow cyclists to cycle in them safely, avoiding drains, etc, while encouraging motorists to give cyclists sufficient space when passing (""as much space as a small car"").

* Cycle lanes contain more debris as they are not swept as frequently by large motor vehicle wheels.

* Cycle lanes frequently encourage poor road positioning at junctions.

* Cycle lanes are frequently rougher than the main carriageway and if painted offer less grip than tarmac in the wet.

* Cycle tracks (""off road"") are not built or maintained to the same standards as roads, and have design speeds typically no more than 10mph.

* Cycle tracks are not included on most road maps, and are poorly signposted so a poor choice for getting somewhere unfamiliar.  They're also often longer than the equivalent road route.

* Cycle tracks are frequently filled with obstacles including barriers, signposts, bus stops, bollards.

* Both often end abruptly and with little consideration for where the cyclists should go next; typically the cyclist is expected to give way to traffic on the main carriageway when, given the ""official"" road user hierarchy, motor vehicles would be expected to give way to the cycle track.

* In particular cycle tracks crossing road junctions are particularly dangerous, requiring the cyclist to stop and check (typically at least 3 ways), whereas cycling along the main carriageway they can just continue on.

* Both encourage the impression that cyclists should not be using the main carriageway and therefore resentment towards them when they do.

* Both encourage dependency on the facilities, so cyclists do not get experience in cycling with traffic.  I guess this is fine if you expect to have cycle routes everywhere anyone could possibly go, but not helpful otherwise.

My opinion is the problem is not that we don't have motor traffic free routes.  The problem is that we don't enforce existing legislation against those who endanger and kill more vulnerable road users.",0,1344445597,null,0,false,0,c5q27u4,t3_xvjex,t1_c5q27u4,t1_c5pzlar,null,1429585077,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Little pricey for a player mostly coming off the bench but again his marketability makes up for that exponentially.

2. Allen - I wish his price was more reasonable say somewhere in the 13-18 range but he is the calm and collected player we need. Honestly anyone to keep Adam's off the field. 

3. Ramirez - I would like to see any of the 3 below signed before him, but he is an intriguing young prospect.

4. Sahin/Affelay/Adam Johnson - At least 1 of these guys will come in on loan for us and be a big hit. I think Johnson is rotting away at City, even if he doesn't come to us he needs to be playing.

3. Look above about Modric, RVP is most likely staying, no one wants to pay for him and Juve has been turned down every time. Looks like he's staying at Arsenal. Drogba has left but now Torres has started to really regained form, you don't win the Golden Boot at Euros for being a bad player.

4. Agreed

5. Kagawa is a great player but remember that Vidic is back and he is a world class defender, and Giggs and Scholes seemed to have found the fountain of youth. Also watch out for Antonio Valencia, if he stays healthy he will have a monster year.

6. Last year was certainly weak year for the PL, but now almost every team has imported world class talent, if we get Sahin and perhaps Tello that would be HUGE for us. We can then boast a pretty strong team by anyone's standards.

7. It's possible, but if they keep Tevez happy for the whole season that's another huge improvement to the squad, it makes a difference when you don't have a player of Tevez's quality for 80% of the season.

He obeys its contract; everything is by the book, all except that he is a jerk. But Mr. Levy, who has no problem breaking a ""gentlemen agreement"", he is a wise salesman and great manager.

You will go when I say you'll go, where I say and for the price that suits me.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"&gt;Well the whole gay marriage thing was fast tracked by the Scottish Parliament because they want to act like they can function as an independent country, 

Alternative hypothesis- the parliament decided it wasn't worth that much debate and decided to shuffle it along. A lot of policy is treated like this- you can't have exhaustive half year long debates, redrafts and nitpicking for every policy that passes through the halls of power. There just aren't enough hours in the day.

As such a role of a representative is not only to debate policy, but also to decide how much time it's worth spending on it, or indeed bothering to take part at all (again it's simply not possible for a representative to appear for every last parliamentary session, especially if they are also a minister).

&gt;...despite the fact that it would make far more sense if it was passed universally in Westminster (which is a planned bill for this governmental term and has cross-party support).

Why? Isn't the purpose of a separate Scottish parliament to allow them to enact policy independent of Westminster? If they just wait for Westminster to do the same, where is the point in all that expense? Is there any reason why this policy in particular should be homogenous with Westminster policy over any other policy?

&gt;Salmond's SNP (Scottish National Party) are chess players. Everything they do boils down to messing with the ties between Scotland and the rest of the UK.

That's pretty much an irrelevant point to be honest. You could have condensed the entire thing down to ""Salmond's SNP are made up of politicians."" Balancing relationships is pretty much what they do; be it to prevent war between two nations or to stick a knife in someone's back to kill a policy. Why would you want them to do anything else? Scheming, conniving and a keen sense of which way the wind is blowing is what makes a good... sorry, a *skilled* politician.

&gt;Not that I'm saying that they don't support gay marriage, nor is it a bad thing that it was passed, but the timing has other motivations.

Yes it does *possibly* have other motivations, but then again so does everything else a politician does. A conservative backbencher votes against marriage equality not because of serious political reasons but because he doesn't like it. At the same time another one votes for it not because she actually believes in it but because she's bucking for promotion and wants to toe the Cameron line.

I can't believe I just wrote the words 'wants to toe the Cameron line.'

And then a third votes for it because he actually believes it is ethical, right and high time it changed.

At the end of the day many politicians end up doing the right thing for the wrong reasons and vise versa too.

true,donniex7,flair2,,"Levy's ""Gentleman's Agreement"" to allow Modrić to leave was entirely contingent upon the club's valuation of him being met by the buyer first. If Madrid/Chelsea/PSG came in with an offer that met the club's asking price, then he would be gone already. So Levy hasn't reneged on any promises he made, because nobody has met that valuation yet. And while there are some *similarities* to slavery within the game, that lies almost exclusively in the trafficking of young players from Asia/Africa. Comparing this situation and all of this talk of ""slavery"" in Europe's top leagues is an absolute disgrace of a joke. 

First, players have far more power now than they did even ten years ago, as is evident in the sales of Nasri to Manchester City, pitching a fit until Arsenal agreed to sell him. You didn't see players forcing clubs to sell them in the past, but it's nearly common place today.

Secondly, as noted by Waffuls above, if Luka had wanted all along to move on sooner than he has, he should have NEVER signed a six year contract to begin with. The reason why he did sign it? Not because he wanted Spurs to be compensated fairly when he left (the run-of-the-mill response from most players), but because A) he get's a cut of his sell-on fee, and B) because his agent wants him to move so he himself can get an even bigger cut of the fee. In signing a long contract, all he was doing was protecting his and his greedy agent's own self interests.

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery, etc.

&gt;Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.

&gt;The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.

&gt;No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

&gt;The lower strata of the middle class — the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants — all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.

true,hhmmmm,null,null,"&gt;Never jump red lights at junctions, it gives cyclists a bad rep aside from being incredibly dangerous. I must admit that at some pedestrian crossings I've done it because I've not liked the situation; I'm not proud of it mind you.


Largely agree with you but disagree with you here. 

Jumping red lights when its safe in particular and being more pushy in traffic, going onto pavements at junctions etc generally has been shown to be far far safer for cyclists reducing deaths.

An area of Paris is introducing laws allowing bikes to skip reds legally to stay safe.

Women cyclists die disproportionately largely as a result of left hand turning vehicles, the thing that kills most cyclists by a mile, because women cyclists do not push forward and skip reds etc nearly as much as men.

I'm all for what you say, except when it puts me at greater risk of getting hit. Then I will skip reds, mount pavements near junctions and so on when I deem them to be safer. The route I cycle regularly there are several places where 

There is one pedestrian crossing near a left hand turn with parked cars  all ways and busy traffic and cars pulling out and into the left hand turn and a regularly used bus stop just before the left hand turn. If I get there at a bad time and the light is red, I will skip it because if I don't I know there is a good chance I will lose a good position and good visibility on the road I have as I normally and get more chance of being hit and pushed into parked cars by overtaking cars who swing back in. (I've expained it poorly because the layout is quite odd but trust me skipping a red there when the pedestrians have crossed is entirely sensible).",0,1344452706,null,0,false,0,c5q49sw,t3_xvjex,t1_c5q49sw,t1_c5pyxo8,null,1429586049,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The other reason is that the first movie *Dr. Who and the Daleks* in particular piles on the campy humor and slapstick.  It seems like the filmmakers showed disdain for the original material by turning it into a comedy.  This is probably the biggest reason fans don't like it.

I'd argue that the second film *Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.* is actually a big improvement over the first one.

&gt; So tell me, how much would you appreciate Luka if he wouldn't practice good manners, like Mr. Levy. Let’s say that he keeps his contract with Spurs, but instead of being the engine of spurs team, he becomes side player. The guy that runs a little on practice, shoots couple of balls and go home with 40/60/80 000 per week in his pocket... that’s a pretty good amount for anybody to put food the table. He obeys its contract; everything is by the book, all except that he is a jerk.

If that's how he wants to do it, then fine. He can play poorly, and then in two years when he only has one year left on his contract, he can try and force a move to Madrid only to realize that the only teams interested in a player who's been mediocre for 2 years are Fulham and Liverpool. Or, worse, if he decides to play artificially poorly, he doesn't get game time. You're a Croatia fan, you want that to happen as little as we do, since he'll regress as a player without getting any playtime. But we have players who've been crap for a couple of years already. Bentley, Bassong, Jenas, Dos Santos, etc. Having them on the team isn't the end of the world for Spurs, but if Modric decides to stage that as his rebellion, he's effectively scuttling his own career. He's a brilliant player and that would be in no one's interest.

&gt; But Mr. Levy, who has no problem breaking a ""gentlemen agreement"", he is a wise salesman and great manager. He works in the best interest of the club, so everything shitty he does is OK. It shouldn't care how much money he wants, he promised one thing, does another, and all the yids are mad at Modric for his dishonest behavior.

A gentleman's agreement which there is no proof even took place, first of all. No one is mad at Modric because Modric is not being dishonest. His intentions are crystal clear. My question to you is this: If we as fans should expect no loyalty from Modric to the club despite him signing a contract (in essence, a promise to the club), why should Levy have any loyalty to Modric over that of the club he's managing? What ""evil things"" has he done, pray tell? The understanding was presumably that he would listen to offers that came in, NOT that he would put a bow on Modric's head and drive him over to Madrid himself after selling him for 10 pence and a biscuit. Levy's been fulfilling his part of the agreement. It's been shown time and time again that he is negotiating and willing to sell Modric. However, that doesn't mean that we should sell for the price Madrid want to buy for. That's not how it works. Nobody's word, no gentleman's agreement, is worth 10 million pounds. If Modric wants to pony up the difference himself because it's such a dream move, then more power to him, he lives his dream, and he's out of our hair.

&gt; I don’t know if you have noticed, but selling and buying football players has become a huge business, such business, that it has received some of the marks of slavery.

A horrible, misleading exaggeration. We're talking about people that make more than the average yearly salary in most developed countries, in a week, for kicking a ball around. Sure, at it's most base level, technically, it's correct. However, the difference is, slaves had little to no choice in becoming slaves. Modric willingly put pen to paper and signed 6 year deal. We're talking about a 24 year old signing a contract, not a green 16 year old who doesn't know any better. He knew the risks and the consequences of that action, and he has no one to blame but himself. Or perhaps his agent, who he hired, so it all comes back to him. Levy never held a gun to his head and told him to sign, I don't know why people keep ignoring that.

&gt;  Imagine your boss tells you that you are sold to the rival company

Players can, and have, declined to move clubs before, despite their current club's efforts to sell them (Dos Santos is a good example of this).

&gt; or better yet, You are not allowed to move anywhere for the next five years of your life, because you signed a contract

So what are you saying, that we should free them from all contractual obligations because they might change their mind sometime in the next 5 years? You don't want to be stuck at a club for 5+ years? Here's a simple solution: DON'T SIGN A 5+ YEAR CONTRACT UNLESS YOU'RE 100% SURE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MOVE.

&gt; you are earning him so much money that you don’t have the right to make any choice about your own life. You will go when I say you'll go, where I say and for the price that suits me. It doesn't matter how much you get paid, it's the freedom of choice that is missing.

Again, horrible exaggeration. The amount of money he earns makes no difference to what choices he does or doesn't have, I only mentioned how much money he makes initially to justify why I don't feel any sympathy for him. You keep glossing over this fact. He had the choice to not sign the contract, and in the end chose to sign it. He is now to be held to the terms of that contract. In any line of work, if you put pen to paper and sign a contract while being completely aware of what it is you're signing and being willing to, you are to be held to that. 

Again, as I've said before, Levy is fulfilling his part of the agreement. He's willing to sell. He's negotiating. He's being stubborn, but that's to be expected. If you're going to be frustrated, be frustrated with Madrid. They clearly don't want Modric as much as Modric wants them, and at the moment no one else is going to even try for him, so what then?

true,donniex7,flair2,,"I think you misread. While I certainly can't fault him for wanting to move on to Real -- who wouldn't want to play for them? -- I called Luka's *agent* greedy. Though it would be naive to think that Luka's desire to move on to another club isn't at least partially motivated by money. 

Yes, Modrić is typically very humble and a model professional, and I think he could easily make the grade in Madrid. But he's been a bit of spoiled brat in the way he's handled himself this summer, what with skipping the flight to LA and then not showing for training right away. He's hardly been the saint you've painted him as.

As for assumptions, I really only made one. That was regarding his ""Gentleman's Agreement"", and that was because Levy is too smart a business man to make such an agreement without having a condition of his own... the requirement for his asking price to be met. I never called Levy a gentleman. He's just a shrewd business man, and that sometimes means hurting peoples feelings. It's as if Luka only heard half of the agreement.

Everything else I stated was fact: Luka get's a cut of his sell on fee, his agent gets a bigger cut, and that signing a longer contract generally means a higher selling price, players have more power than they did. And if you don't think Luka's agent is greedy, get off the bath salts. There's no such thing as a non-greedy agent.

I'm seen them explained in more modern books in a far more accessible and applied manner.

It's a good book, but I don't know if I would recommend it, because it is somewhat dated in parts (for example we don't have many industrial workers in the UK anymore), I know that one can essentially equate menial Services work to the old industrial labour but it isn't identical and there are many other things that have become apparent such as the true cost of environmental damage etc. which aren't covered.

The book certainly doesn't deserve the reputation it's given by the right-wing media, but on the other hand I can't help but think that a more modern book might be better.

But then I suppose one could make the same arguments for The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists and that is probably my favourite book of all time, but then it is a book written about a certain time, as is the Communist Manifesto.

Silly attitude, which has been shown not to work across the world in even the most brutal prisons.

Hell holes create twisted animals on release, not people who think ""hey, that wasn't nice I think I'll just sort my life out now"".

Prisons need to be mostly about rehabilitation and training, so when they get out they actually have a chance, rather than being in an even worse situation than when they went in before of the X years employment gap and having to declare their prison sentence for every job.

The punishment is their loss of freedom.  Prisons shouldn't be about torture or revenge.

_[spoiler](#s """"What River whispered into the Doctor’s ear has never been fully established but it’s long believed that in order to gain his trust River was whispering the Doctor’s name"""")_

But just before she dies, the last thing they say to each other is:

**Doctor:** 
_[spoiler](#s """"River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear. There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could..."""")_

**River:**

So when he whispered something in her ear at the end of _The Wedding of River Song,_ it was probably just _""look into my eye""_. He couldn't say that out loud without ruining his fake death, so he lied there. But when he was talking to River before her death in the Library, it was just the two of them, and he had no reason to lie.

He couldn't tell her his name at the end of _Wedding_ because they weren't at the one point where he would even be able to do so. But he must tell her eventually, he just hasn't yet.


**Edit:** They better not screw this up. I don't think they will, but I'm also not sure I *want* to know the Doctor's name. I don't know if anything that could be pronounced out loud could possibly live up to 50 years of hype. The equivalent of *Romanadvoratrelundar* won't cut it.

true,AgentFalcon,null,null,"Definitely. There's lots of great stuff there to add background info to what you've seen in the later series.

Some recomendations, no particular order:

Genesis of the Daleks - 4th Doctor - for background on Davros and the Daleks. Essential viewing.

The War Games - 2nd Doctor - Long epic mystery arc. A bit repetitive in the middle, but the ending of it was fantastic. Matt Smith has emulated the 2nd Doctor quite a bit too if you want to compare. I belive it was his favorite Doctor.

The Deadly Assassin - 4th Doctor - No companion. Just the Doctor vs the Master on Gallifrey with lots of Time Lords. Very interesting if you've only seen the newer series, though they might not be quite as epic here as they've been built up to be...

The Five Doctors - 1-5th Doctor - Just as epic and great as it sounds.

The Invasion of Time - 4th Doctor - Sontarans vs.Time Lords.

The Tomb of the Cybermen - 2nd Doctor - First Cybermen story.

[The Black Guardian Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Guardian_Trilogy) - 5th Doctor - Not related yet, but constantly rumoured to be a big bad in newer series. 

Otherwise I'd pretty much recommend all the 4th and most of the 5th Doctor episodes. 

I've not watched any of the 1st and 3rd Doctor stories, but the first Silurian episodes are in the 3rds era and I belive they're pretty good too and for the 1st you should probably see the first episode for the start of the show. Not many other episodes of his or the 2nd doctor have survived though :(

Personally I didn't like any of the 6th and 7th Doctor episodes enough to recommend and the 8th Doctor movie wasn't very good either.

So I watched Doctor Who 6 years after the reboot started.  Lastly, this isn't one person writing all of these.  It's the hundreds of people on Reddit who have seen Doctor Who.  So maybe they don't realize how much this joke has been made and know that it will gain them karma.  

And, FYI, yeah, people on FB do make this joke.  The new Whovians, all the time.  It can get old, but it's not something to get uppity and downvote on.  It's not that serious of a thing.

I sent the link to my friends because they (like me) weren't fully aware that rape like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/c5jtt3p) can happen.

&gt;...To be honest, even remembering it now, the squirming always made it better, they didn't want it to happen, but they couldn't do anything about it. Most girls don't say no either. They think you're a good guy, and should pick up on the hints, they don't want to have to say ""no"" and admit to themselves what's happening.

&gt;Alcohol helped. Having a few drinks during the movie, or doing a few jello shots that were ""prepared for a party that weekend"" would usually do the trick.

&gt;The aftermath was always different. Some girls left after about 15 minutes after. Some girls would stay until the morning and then leave. A few tried to call back, maybe blaming themselves for what happened or something...

That is valuable knowledge right there. That rape happened without any threats or violence; he just convinced the victims that they didn't  want to try and stop him.

The problem with paying full wage is that you're back to the status-quo; companies will just go for the more qualified applicants (of which there are an abundance right now). The demographic problem with that is that the more qualified applicants the the older ones who have prior work experience; it becomes impossible for school-leavers to get a toe-hold on the job ladder. Of course, you could pay them full whack and the government could subsidise their training directly...but that's just another form of subsidising the private sector.

I should add that I don't consider this a particularly good solution, its just that there don't seem to be any other ideas knocking about. Anyone comes up with something better? Knock this on the head. Monitoring demonstrates this has little/no effect on the employability of youngsters? Knock it on the head. Companies abusing the system? Etc.

Downing will probably fit in primarily rotating with the front 3, but can play in the midfield 3 as well - he's played central midfield for Villa in the past and he's a decent passer, albeit more accurate than prolific. A lot of the integration of the style, the rotation of players and their adapting to the philosophy is going to happen over time, which is another reason why Allen would be a great addition - he'll enforce that philosophy right away, setting something of a foundation for the rest of the team to work with and dictating the way the team will play.",0,1344462549,null,0,false,0,c5q76gd,t3_xwgxs,t1_c5q76gd,t1_c5q6w40,null,1429587498,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

I don't have a problem with convicts having a TV to watch.  Woman shouldn't be in the cells, that's a safety issue at the very least, but they are allowed in on visits.  Alcohol is banned for obvious reasons, although that doesn't stop the odd ""home brew"" fermentation of food scraps being found.

Like I said, it sounds like your going on gut feelings of wanting revenge.  Thankfully we're better than that and you have no say in how our prisons are run.  Just your drunken impotent rage.

There's a small minority of convicts that don't mind prison, but that's down to how shit their life is outside.  Most people hate being there.  But the entire idea prison is a holiday camp is a joke.

Based on the Redknapp interview, and Modric behavior which is highly unlikely to his character, I’ve come to the conclusion that the little guy has been played, just because of his naivety when signing the contract. YES HE WAS WRONG. He fucked up. He shouldn't sign it. Probably the only reason he signed it was because of the belief in the word of Mr. Levy. HE FUCKED UP HERE ASWELL. He should've put some sort of clause or something else. HE FUCKED UP. 

What I don't condone is this atrocious transfer system. Long term contracts are becoming more and more a standard. Without a long term contract, players have a little to no chance of success, no matter how good they play. I AM sympathetic to the little man, and I really don't care how much he earns, this is purely from one human to another.

I understand your side of the story and you have a good point in some of the discussed parts.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh9HJnHMeWk

Most of the podcasts were removed from itunes (I think automatically). Same on the website chortle.co.uk that hosted it (and currently hosts Ray and Ed's current podcast Peacock and Gamble, which is probably better) although there is still about half on chortle.

http://www.chortle.co.uk/raypeacock/ It'll in one of these eps

However it has been archived by Pilkipedia and you can get the rest here http://www.pilkipedia.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=8731 which is where I got the rest from.


Because so much of the podcast revolved around them mocking and torturing Raji James (who was in on it and a willing participant who usually played up to them and to some extent played a part) and in the end some people stopped seeing it as a joke and started being genuinely horrible to him online and it basically damaged the chance of his acting career picking up. As a result (and it also being an old stuff and they've done loads since) Ray Peacock has basically said he has no problem people going and finding it online but he isnt going to re-upload it to itunes or chortle etc.

I think it's genuinely hilarious and really worth a listen (starts a bit slow as they get into and ed isnt in it but it was one of the first non Ricky Gervais comedy podcasts and they are working out what they are doing). 

I remember listening to it for the first time starting at some random episode and listening while cycling and having to stop cycling and sit down because I was laughing so hard I was going to fall off my bike.

As for the marriages that have taken place in various cultures throughout the world for millennia, let's not forget that marriage used to be (and still is in some places) a way to bind women to men, placate warring tribes, appease angry gods, trade cattle. 

Early nomadic peoples would practise something similar to what became marriage, where the woman would be required to carry out certain duties (weaving, making clothing, taking care of animals) thus securing a position in the tribe for the 'husband'.

I think that people still get married because they simply can't imagine that they really don't need to. Why not write a will if you're worried that your partner won't have anything when you die?

true,widgetas,null,null,"To reply to your last question: Don't worry about me - I know the general reasons as to why people do or do not get married these days, in the UK. I was wondering, given your first comment, if you did.

You seem to be under the impression that I don't know these things, when in actual fact I was probing your reasoning that marriage is (currently) primarily a religious institution. This is not the case, and I note that the reasons you give in your last comment don't make reference to religion at all, save for the appeasement aspect (not terribly relevant in Europe for the last who-knows-how-many years). As such it sorta undermines your initial comment, even though I'll admit that many of the reasons can be tied into certain faiths.

Even if marriage was initially a religious ceremony (depending on where you are and when, it wasn't), it certainly no longer is for very many people. And that's nothing new (again: marriage act 1836) and that particular legislation implies that people didn't want the religious aspect 'even back then'.

People don't just ""make a will"" or ""throw a party"", because the ceremony and significance of a wedding has a certain social weight (whether that's a good thing or not). Plus it allows family and friends to get together, allowing the couple to make a declaration of commitment to each other in front of those people. Actually following from that: what is a marriage these days if not a short union ceremony followed by a massive party?

In a bid to be snarky: Why not take a moment to consider, before you dismiss someone, that they might not be an ignoramus simply because they disagree with you? I should point out that I didn't explicitly disagree, but rather only ask you a pertinent question.

true,IIAOPSW,uk,"""the states""... don't look at me like that","I'd go even further. By use of subreddits, reddit is anything you want it to be. Sometimes its a community for your favourite game or show. Other times its just a collection of content from people that like similar content. And Still further it can be a place where you can interact directly with people from all over the world and get information without the filter of traditional media.

My absolute favourite thing is when politicians do an AMA.

1. Everyone has a say. The questions they have to answer bubble to the top because people care about them. No person gets a greater voice because they are the producer/moderator/rich.
2. It is there in writing. You can tell when a question is dodged because it is sitting there up at the top unanswered. People will hound you. You can't get away with things. 
3. It is there in writing (again). On this site, you don't have a face and you don't have a voice. You have a username (often a crude one). What you put forth is judged purely on its merit. It forces you to consider the candidate for the policy that they represent, not their eloquence in speaking or air-brushed good looks. It also gives the person time to sit, think and compose a well thought out response which is something often lacking in political debates.

However, I don't agree that company owners should be forced to effectively hire someone whom may pose a threat to the company, such as the potential for disruption or work place de-harmonisation.

Just to state my bias, I run a small business and I need my people to get along, if they didn't I'd be screwed and soon go out of business. Additionally if I had some ultra left activist sticking to the second of working times or effectively ""going slow"" if they didn't like something, it could cause my business to crumble.

While in a perfect world this would not be a problem, it most certainly is in the real private sector world where cash is king for small business and any waste (such as on an employee that causes trouble) could mean collapse.

According to the guy I quoted this could mean someone who insists that safety procedures are adhered to. Construction can be a dangerous business, but safety meaures cost money. If people likely to insist that safety is paramount are blacklisted then that is an issue.

A few key pieces that get overlooked imo: is that independence won't revoke the Britishness from Scotland, it is still the British isle and we would still have the queen as head of state (like Canada or Australia and many more). furthermore there would remain a unique relationship between all members of the British isle.

The issue that swayed me (I was once staunchly pro union) was that of control over the power of parliament and corruption. I believe in local power as a means of best accountability as well as dealing with local issues, blanket policys dont have a grand success rate from what I've seen. This is just a snippet as i could go on for a while.

The alternative to the independence, I think, is a devolved English (PR) parliament, that way Westminster becomes a parliament of non devolved issues such as defence and tax (if they're insistent on keeping fptp), and I'd think it fair that England gets what scotland, Wales and ireland have, which would remove the lothian question.

Far better to keep up what's working well in London, the cycle superhighways are flawed but still rather effective. Boris bikes put thousands more on the roads. Most London boroughs have free or subsidised cycle training that even experienced cyclists can benefit from. 

The more cyclists that are on the roads on an equal footing with cars, the safer it is for us all. By all means consider segregation of busier or faster roads (Euston Road is crying out for one) and I think an increase in segregated contra flows on one way streets are a good idea.

All of this is written from River's perspective. For instance when I say; River's last kiss I mean the first kiss from The Doctor's point of view. Of course we haven't seen the full story yet, but as I understand it this is the order:

&lt;=|+|=&gt;

1. S6 Ep08 - Let's Kill Hitler - Melody Pond, 'Mels', first regenerates into the Dr. River Song form that we all know and love.

2. S6 Ep07 - A Good Man Goes to War - Amy, Rory, and The Doctor learn what here name really is. After this, they don't know who she is.

3. S6 Ep01 &amp; 02 - The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon - River kisses the Doctor for her last time. Everything after this point happens while The Doctor doesn't know her very well.

4. S5 Ep12 &amp; 13 - The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang - River says that The Doctor will be finding out who she is ""very soon now"".

5. S5 Ep04 &amp; 05 - The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone - River says ""You'll see me again quite soon, when the Pandorica opens."" This indicates that she has already been there and that this was the last time that they met.

6. S4 Ep09 &amp; 10 - Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead - This is the first time that The Doctor meets River; and is therefore the last time that she meets him, because she dies and her consciousness gets stuck in the planet's database.

1.5, 3, &amp; 5.1.   S6 Ep13 - The Wedding of River Song - For the River sitting on the beach, this happens during The Impossible Astronaut. For the River in the spacesuit, this happens before A Good Man Goes to War but after Let's Kill Hitler. Finally, for the River at the end that tells Amy that the Doctor is alive, she sees that as happening after the crash of the Byzantium (the ship Flesh and Stone takes place in).

England was outdated back then. It had a huge recession and a lot that should have been invested and changed in the years prior to that didn't happen and that meant the end for the british industry. Thatcher buried the rest of it and without the north sea oil GB would be even worse of. Kinda sad. Also the going-private of many public services made stuff worse.

The have such a malign influence of our daily lives, they are damaging innovation for everyone and who use their position to make sure competition cannot exist on an anywhere fair playing field (hence why they owe the EU 1 billion US dollars in an anti trust case)

Want an example of how MS are damaging us ?

How about their support for such laws as PIPA and ACTA (if we didn't fund these shits they wouldn't be able to lobby in support of such bad laws.

It angers me so much that as a tax payer I HAVE to fund this hideous company when there is no reason at all - when they gained their monopoly in the 90's you could argue that there was really no competition, that is just not the case now.
NO government dept 'needs' to run any Microsoft products.

They also lobbied In Europe for  the software patents bill  
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/06/eu_bins_swpat/  but thankfully the EU destroyed the bill.

For anyone who is slightly interested in why they have the position they have (its not by having a better product)  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Halloween_documents_leak

(Doesn't have much info on the last 1/2 decade - they haven't changed - in some way got far worse

Anyone who knows about the company SCO see

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies#Microsoft_funding_of_SCO_controversy

They are a hideous company who will use any immoral means to bugger their competitors - Microsoft customers are like people locked in the Matrix, they just need to wake up.

The money Gates has given back probably doesn't equal the money he has skanked from various governments in the 1st place.

Maybe he's giving the wealth back due to guilt ?

The whole 'Occupy' movement should have a closer look at what OS they are using on their PC's and ask themselves if it is moral to financially support a company that supports ACTA/PIPA, etc.

They may have had a better product in the mid 90's when they gained their monopolist position - since then they put more effort into preventing competition (and thus attacking the ability for mankind to advance technologically)
If anyone here is to say ' they have changed now' - they have NOT

Here is (yet another) example of the damage Microsoft does to society - they lobbied my government to abandon their policy of adopting open systems... this is far worse when you consider that MS are jacking up the cost of the licenses (which if were not using open standards means being dependent on MS.)

http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/01/09/uk-government-reportedly-caves-in-to-microsoft-on-open-standards-it-policy/

The lobbying will make society worse for all, not adopting open standards will cost the tax payer more in the long run - money that will go to this shithole of a company.

And it's quite likely that some people didn't go to university at all because they were under the impression they would need to have £9K in cash to attend.

Our ancestors did not have the same technologies available to determine if someone had been murdered or died of natural causes.

The evolution of religion and human ability to believe in a higher power could be said to have directly led to civilisation as we know it, because without the cohesive society that sticking to the rules brings we could not have worked together to create it. 

Of course we have other ways to do that today and religion is no longer necessary for society to survive.

I much prefer a rack as opposed to a rucksack as it lowers your centre of gravity, keeps your fluroescent jacket visible and stops you back getting so sweaty.

Have a good look at the welded joints - do they look ugly? Compare it to welds on a Brompton.

Make sure you don't get twist grip gear changes - up and down paddles are much better.

Make sure you have two bottle rack mounting points on the frame - some come just with one. You can use the second one for pump/etc.

Make sure frame has holes to fit mudguards.

Road tax, or VED is a cost on emissions, its more a car tax than a road tax - bikes have no emissions

Fuel tax is a cost on fuel - bikes don't use fuel

Congestion tax is a tax on congestion - bikes don't (for the most part) cause congestion.

Parking charges - bikes take up about 1/6 the space, and can be parked off road, in houses, in work places, cars cannot.

What part of those taxes do you think a cyclist should be paying exactly to make it more fair for you?

Im sure that part of the fines (from speeding maybe) or other miscellaneous car related taxes do go towards the upkeep of the roads - in the same way they go towards the upkeep of the fire service or the NHS. But by in large the cost comes from General taxation, its been that way since the 30s when ""Road tax"" was abolished (btw, all this info is on-line)

In case you missed the Heseltine quote..

Dimbleby: What was the biggest U-turn Mrs Thatcher did?

Heseltine: Oh, I suppose on the Falklands. 

Dimbleby: What, she wasn't going to go to the Faklands? 

Heseltine: No. There was a deal with Galtieri and the Right wing of the Tory Party overturned it in 1982, was it? Or 1981? Whenever it was, it was very early in the... 

Dimbleby: But they did actually invade the Falklands, it was slightly different. 

Heseltine: Not at all. Mrs Thatcher, through the voice of Nick Ridley announced a deal with the Argentinians and that was her policy. A group of Right wing Conservative MPs said ""we won't put up with this"" and Mrs Thatcher gave in.

Presumably as part of this arrangement some form of compensation and transition plan was already in place to either bring the Islanders to the UK or offer them the chance to stay put under Argentinian administration.

If you consider the actual economic value of the Islands to the UK this would have been a very pragmatic thing to do at the time. I imagine the kudos of retaining control of the Islands has not yet paid for the cost of the campaign to ensure their liberation 31 years ago.

Of course now any talk of return is impossible as there were a lot of lives lost to retain them in 1982. 

I didn't check last year when the 30 year cabinet papers were released whether the Falklands memos were kept locked away for longer or were put into the public domain.Nicholas Ridley's announcements on the matter would make interesting reading now.

So it's only the people who earn decent wages but who get no benefit from university who would come off worse.

The problem with the tuition fee increase wasn't the extra money that students will have to pay (later in their careers), it's that the extra money will not go to improve the quality of the education they stand to receive. When the number of students was doubled in the early 90s, tuition grants for universities stayed the same. In less than five years, funding per student halved, and staff:student ratios doubled. 

The first two tuition fee increases helped the situation, with all the extra money actually going to tuition, but the coalition hijacked the process as an excuse to reduce public expenditure on Universities. It's seriously no wonder that Oxbridge produce such a high percentage of prominent figures, when they are the only universities that have the outside income necessary to maintain the level of education which was previously available to all students.

I don't understand this 'massive credit to those who upload' and call for support of them. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is this not directly ripping off the club we love? Yeah, we all want the news and videos and enjoy them, etc - but is this not essentially taking money directly from the pockets of the club? I don't know if it's a *major* source of income or the exact math, but I know memberships/subscriptions to what is meant to be exclusive content from LFCTV is a source of income for the club.

Every time someone rips one of these videos from the site and puts it on youtube, how *isn't* this theft? Granted, this happens regularly with all sorts of things, but encouraging supporters to evade the purchase of a membership in order to view these things seems almost..hypocritical. You know, you get tons of ""yeahh, yeahh support the club buy a shirt woohoo i got my scarf from the club directly wooo"" and then these people turn around and go on youtube to find exclusive videos.

I'm American and a long time paying subscriber to LFCTV. I enjoy it, it's worth every penny to me (it's pretty inexpensive, really..) and I don't mind paying for it. I'm not well off, and I too have bills to pay like most adults. I don't think it's appropriate to rip the videos from LFCTV and share them with non-paying supporters - because what the fuck am I paying for then? Yeah, okay, I get access whenever I want blah blah and all that, I have more benefits than say, the OP here, but if you all are getting the most popular videos from it for free (mind you, they do give out free content from time to time) - then why would you subscribe to it and pay for it yourself?

I don't know man, but this has always rubbed me the wrong way. I brought this up a few months ago and got downvoted to hell and shit all over by my own fellow supporters, and for what? Because I encourage funding the club even on the most microscopic level? People have argued that LFC don't get the money for this or that it goes into some other element blah blah blah - but if they're the one's charging, it's funds generated by them somehow, some way, and is something in the area of £5 a month more than they had for SOMETHING had I not retained my membership. 

Am I truly alone in feeling this way? I want everyone to get all the news they can afford time for, be up to date and enjoy Liverpool *just as much as the next guy* but I strongly feel like this is just..obnoxious. You'll *get* the news, you'll *read* an article on this from *somewhere* eventually, why can't we just let this level of content that's explicitly restricted to one channel, one source, the club directly which you're meant to pay for..be what it's meant to be. I know youtube tries to tackle these things eventually, but catering to it only really adds stuff for the people we support to try to combat. 

Can't we just..discourage this? I don't support this, it's like supporting bootlegging. I'm no damn saint, I got a torrent for the season highlights where I could probably have bought it somewhere - yeah, I know, I don't buy EVERYTHING I can - but shit.

Encouraging people to take up sports for fun and fitness is great but to use the people who are the best at it as role models is ridiculous... most of it's just genetic luck anyway - you can't be a fast runner without long legs, etc.

Sure it takes hard work to train to the point where you can win once you have the genetic advantage, but that isn't even the reason for the inspiration is it - all we should be encouraging people to do is take up sport for fun and fitness... because the majority of people are already pre-determined losers at competitive sport no matter how much they try! But seriously, if you someone needs a sports personality to get you to play sports for *fun* and *fitness* then you have a problem already.

It's just as silly as people who strive for fame - they get told they can do it if they try, but it's bullshit. If all the people who wanted to be famous through music, art, etc. tried their damnedest it would still never happen to most of them.

So the different here: academically, with science, even business, charities, community work, public awareness, and any other random projects, etc. *everyone* can make a worthwhile, lasting contribution to mankind, regardless. Sure some people might make the bigger discoveries and win a nobel prize, and they will probably be out of some genetic luck too - but there's a huge difference here between putting in some effort and making a real difference in the world for lasting generations, and putting in effort for something immaterial that is going to leave 99% of people with unfulfilled dreams because society has set them up to aspire to something unachievable.

&gt; The lowest common denominator - i.e. the very people the tabloids are targeting as customers - don't want to hear about inspirational athletes unless the Olympics are on. The papers might be trash, but they're just delivering the filth that the general public wants.

&gt; The average person can't relate to somebody who has spent their life in pursuit of perfection in a given field. They don't want to read about that unless there's a particular reason for it (e.g. they just won a gold medal for Great Britain). They want to hear about some average Joe who's just like them, who managed to milk some fame and money from reality TV either by showing off what meagre talent they have that shallow fucks wouldn't expect just from looking at them (archetype: Susan Boyle), or from humiliating themselves by displaying their ignorant or shallow nature to the world (archetype: Jade Goody). They want to hear about celebrities doing and saying stupid things, so they can bring them down to their own level. They want to read about pampered footballers spitroasting slags and driving fast cars, because to a lot of people, they're living the dream. There's a reason why most people can name 5 members of the *Jersey Shore* cast or the last 5 *X Factor* winners, but would be unable to name 5 Nobel Prize winners.

&gt; There's a reason why celebrity gossip pervades every tabloid newspaper - it's what the people want. Not all the people, but most of them; enough to sell a metric fuckton of newspapers - and that there is what the papers want. Everybody wins.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"That is quite an assertion, and also a huge liability if it's wrong, considering you are condoning that the nation looks to these people as role models. There's already a huge fucked up portion of an entire generation who think they can grow up to be famous celebrities due to them being fed that crap as role models as if it's the most important thing in life - how can you be so confident that won't simply happen again when everyone is worshipping olympic gods from the age of 3?

But okay, I concede that these two things are not exactly equal - and in fact I never really said they were anyway, but that seems to be the impression I am giving so okay. But the focus is still on the meaningfulness of the pursuits of these people and why they are there on the first place.

What I want you to answer is:

Why should all our role models be genetically superior sports personalities?

And also to draw on what you've said - genetic luck of the draw is not quite being handed something on a plate (still requires some effort), but it is being given a much larger portion on that plate than anyone else gets - these people are only working hard due to some innate talents, many of them were identified as prodigies at a young age, etc. and were basically forced into a life of sports by virtue of their existing abilities. Sure they might enjoy it, but guess what - most people do enjoy doing things they are particularly good at!

It's just such an empty meaningless thing to have as a role model...

**Edit** In summary, if you think the whole hard work thing is meaningful then our role models should be people who have succeeded by hard work *in the face of adversity* rather than people who have succeeded by hard work because they were born with superior abilities. If you want role models that can be universally applicable to mankind, that should be the people you're aiming for.

its not a ""road tax"" its a tax based on your car emissions . If you car has low emissions you don't need to pay it. Simple as that. My bike has no emissions, therefore I don't pay it.

Your thoughts on why its a road tax would have merit if we knew that the amount you/I pay would go straight back into the roads, but we don't, and its not that simple to say it does. All tax generated from the roads goes back into a national pot which is then redistributed to local councils to pay for everything from roads to the police service. There is a much validity of saying VED is a road tax as corporation tax is a road tax.

its its not just me that confirms that, its the government and local council too.

In the Harry Potter series Rowling uses an admitedly basic vocabulary to tell a quite interesting and complicated story, that spans seven novels, capturing the minds of a generation of young children and adults.

In the fifty shades novels E.J James draws ""inspiration"" from an sub-par series of books [Twilight] to write her own trashy novels, that make said source of inspiration appear like it was written by Roberto Bolaño.

The *Fifty Shades...* books are so utterly bereft of any literary merit, they make Dan Browns novels look like the works of David Foster-Wallace in comparison.

Gimmie Rowling, who inspired a generation of kids around the world, and did her bit to make reading ""cool"" again, over James any day of the week.

In comparison, Liverpool were very rarely a pressing outfit under Dalglish - Lucas' immense tackling statistics are more a testament to his insane work rate and lack of defensive responsibilities among the rest of the midfield than anything else. So obviously, if you're just looking at **total** numbers between players from different systems, Joe Allen will have more than any player from Liverpool, because *he's in a team that does it more.*

**It would be better if, *alongside* the total numbers, they showed success rates; that way, you get an idea of how often Allen tackles, and how successful he is at it.**

You need both - just having success rate can be misleading (for example, Jordan Henderson's success rate would be above 80%, but he made fewer than 60 tackles all season - like Raul Meireles before him, Henderson largely seemed to tackle when he was almost certainly sure of winning the ball, although his low total will also have to do with being on the right rather than in the middle.)",0,1344523615,null,0,false,0,c5qj2mm,t3_xxs8n,t1_c5qj2mm,t3_xxs8n,null,1429593169,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Surely children/young teens are more likely to be inspired by athletes and take up a sport than be daunted and scared off.

That intrigues me. FSG said when they bought Liverpool that FFP was a big part of their decision, and it's obvious that their transfer strategy has been planned around abiding by FFP and the assumption that it will be enforced well. In comparison, clubs like Chelsea and PSG seem willing to call UEFA's bluff.

I'm not saying we should be spending like sugar daddies, or that there aren't obvious benefits to being more responsible with money, but it's more an issue of timing - if FSG had realised how porous or toothless UEFA's FFP rules ***might*** be (because we can't know for sure yet), perhaps the transfer strategy would have been less about trimming the wage bill and more about getting back into the top four as quickly as possible (assuming that last summer's buys were still influenced by wage bill considerations)",0,1344526510,null,0,false,0,c5qjsxw,t3_xxisv,t1_c5qjsxw,t3_xxisv,null,1429593506,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

An online company has the advantage that it doesn't necessarily need to have offices in a country to do business there, but as you reach a certain size you end up needing local staff to handle sales etc.

Although Google has a European base in Ireland, it has a UK company operating here, so it would be taxed in the UK on UK registered profits.

(and obviously wages, vat, business rates etc)

It would then repatriate those profits to Ireland, where as a Group it may pay taxes on any surplus after withholdings are applied. Hence, Ireland with its lower corporation tax is preferable for Group HQs.

The big issue is that when they try to move those profits back to the USA they are hit by another US tax which the USA is almost alone in imposing on foreign earnings. This dissuades US firms from investing overseas unless the profits they can generate justify the hassle of dealing with US taxes.

Then, in the summer, one of the rugby pitches and the grass hockey court was turned into an athletics track, with shot, javelin and discus areas, areas for both long and triple jump, two cricket pitches, one with astroturf, one without, plus a softball area.

And yet, the school barely made use of them.  Over five years, we probably used half the facilities.  One of the PE lessons each week, from year ten onwards, we were just chucked into the gym and told to get on with it.

We did use most of them, once or twice, but the majority of the time, it was just football and rugby week in, week out.",0,1344528546,null,0,false,0,c5qkcrq,t3_xxt7g,t1_c5qkcrq,t3_xxt7g,null,1429593780,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8
