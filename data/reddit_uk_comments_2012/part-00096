Hell, if most infrastructure projects are anything to go by they will just throw PFI at it and fuck us up even more. 

I was just pointing to how I would do it under the idea it has the greatest potential for public good. Companies will always favour profit, often dangerously short term profit. The banks knew subprime and ppi to an extent would bike back in the end but the people at the top didn't care. I admit you could make the same argument for government though. 

If we had a state that was genuinely working in the majority of the peoples best interests I believe that that it would offer the best opportunity for success. Whereas with a company the greater public's interest will naturally come after profit. Plus you have the issue of profits themselves in a state vs private model, in a state version you could ensure that all profits were kept inside the organisation to reduce ticket prices and give a better service. Private companies will always look to maximise profits often at the cost of good service and long term investment.

No. Just no.
Speak to a lawyer first. In no way, shape of form does what Caldaribluesaid  apply. S.21(1) Theft Act 1968 concerns blackmail (AKA making threats with menaces). 

A few points,
First and foremost, The Act applies to England and Wales. The OP's flair shows him in Scotland. If this is the case, the Act does not apply.

Second, see s.21(1) - to paraphrase, the person making demands must be making a demand. The correspondence is not making a demand - it would likely be viewed as advising OP of his position. It is a reponse to OPs suggestion for compensation. Unless the letting agency just wants to hand them money for asking, this would be a court matter; i.e. establishing a head of tort, showing and quantifying damage. Messy and very likely not needed.

Third, The person making those demands must be making unwarranted demands. The demands will not be unwarranted if (s.21(1)(a)) if the person (or agents on behalf of) making a demand believes that 'that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand'. In this case, the 'demand' (which likely isn't a demand but regardless) would (IMO) be considered warranted and reasonable. 


If you want to talk about compensation, fine, it seems like it may be a reasonable expectation in your position. If I were in your shoes, I would detail the damages (inconvenience, property, whathaveyou) and ASK them for a statement on their perceived liability to you, their policy on compensation and restitution. Ask this of agents and council. Ask for a copy of your contract, correspondence and any other documents they have relating to yourself (As a subject access request under DPA, if necessary - Scottish law is virtually identical in this regard)

I was thinking that individual churches would happily take up the offer, rather than the bods in charge being denied a licence - you need one of every church surely? But if there was a flat-out refusal for the whole church, I think that would only be for a short time until the uproar causes the guys at the top to realise how out of touch they are.

My solution is only a whimsical observation that, due to the established nature of the CoE, the government is (I think) allowing state sanctioned discrimination on various fronts (gay teachers in faith schools etc.). Personally I think that the force from inside individual churches and communities will eventually lead to religious gay marriages.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; Could someone please help me understand how anyone could be blinded by such poisonous Nationalism? 

I don't think Nationalism is really the driving force behind a lot of these people, in the first instance - most of these groups are coming from relatively impoverished areas, where they feel they are not respected or supported by the institutions of government, and taking matters into their own hands offers a sort of empowerment.

While in most places this would likely run out of steam after a spot of rioting or similar, the established political divide in Northern Ireland offers a natural rallying cry and sense of continuity to this sort of thing. And, once you're involved in this sort of group and have come to the point where you feel vigilante murder is an acceptable way to improve your community, extrapolating it to political aims probably don't seem that big a step. (Note that the many of the groups coming into this new organisation are only loosely ""nationalist"", but are much more involved in attacks on drug dealers and other people who they feel harm the community, at present at least). 

Of course, the presence of such violent groups in communities tends to reduce the effectiveness of the police at dealing with ""everyday"" crimes, and leads to occasional instances of heavy-handed policing to try and deal with the problem, which in turn causes people to further distrust the government and so the merry cycle continues.

I don't think many of them are really in it for the grand nationalist cause any more - rather, it's the accumulation of (hundreds?) of years of slights, feuds and grudges that has this shambling life of its own.",0,1343338502,null,0,false,0,c5jwhog,t3_x7dru,t1_c5jwhog,t1_c5jvpom,null,1429478330,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

My only ""criticism"" as such was that he played like a centre midfielder would play on the wing. This game confirmed where he plays best, in the centre, and that he isn't a natural winger. He didn't appear to be perhaps as creative as I had thought, perhaps due to the focus on the players who have cemented their position in the team, perhaps because it just wasn't his best position.

I've found that Vodafone has the best reception (parent company to Verizon). (This is mostly based on the fact that I get reception at the Easter Bush campus in Roslin whereas my classmates do not.) If you're in the city, any provider should give you decent signal though. It's only when you leave the city centre that it may start to differ. However, I don't know how much Vodafone would charge for PAYG since I'm currently on contract. Vodafone does have an internet dongle option available. It was 9 quid for the equipment itself and about 20 quid per month (must give 30 days notice before cancellation). Your other option is to steal internet from Starbucks or any other cafe that may be offering WiFi. You can also Skype people back at home to reduce international calling costs on your phone.

Keep in mind that if you aren't bringing a phone with you that you can use (just insert SIM card), that a phone will be expensive since you will have to pay full price for it. There are places though that can jailbreak your phone if necessary. However, this affects the stability of the phone and I had major issues with my iPhone after jailbreak. (So I went on contract and got a new phone.)

I think the idea of Carroll becoming a goal-scoring monster under a Rodgers-style system is a bit optimistic but to say the opposite - that Carroll is useless under Rodgers' system - is also a bit too pessimistic.

I have to think Rodgers is smart enough to utilize the strengths of Andy Carroll to fit his tactics, that Andy Carroll is still young enough and skilled enough to adapt to a style of playing, and I have to think that - *at the very least* - Carroll will be a very useful as a change of pace in a variety of matches (Cup matches, Europe, etc.).

I just think people are freaking out unnecessarily about things that are OVER A YEAR OLD. If it's OVER A YEAR OLD THAT'S NOT A SPOILER.

I have an issue with this whole let's redo where the line is because someone someday might start dr who for the first time and we need to shield them from anything that could possibly be a plot point.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Sorry I took awhile, I was on the way to the office and had to deal with the standard early morning emails once I reached. Let's move on. 

I'll put it out right now, because this isn't the first time I've had this discussion, and people always miss this part. **There is no way to measure passion**. Now, while that may be positive, this also means that there is no way for people to prove that they are passionate. People can be stoic and not show much passion due to personality and culture, but that doesn't mean they are not passionate. Regardless, I don't think I have ever doubted anyone's passion on r/liverpoolfc before. 

I have, however, doubted the ""titles"" they give themselves, most recently when QuantoQuandoQuantro called himself a fanatic. But that's going on a tangent. 

While passion cannot be measured, contribution can. Attending a match directly benefits the club's coffers. On top of that, the attending fan has the option to cheer in support of the team. While the exact effect of cheering cannot be accurately measured, it is fair to say that cheering in a game inspires and motivates the player, helping them play better. 

So now, let's assume there are 3 fans. 
A is a fan who attends the match and cheers. 
B is a fan who attends the match and keeps quiet. 
C is a fan who is watching from home. 

A contributes both monetarily and in terms of motivation. 
B contributes only monetarily.
C contributes nothing. 

(Please bear in mind that in this scenario, all 3 fans have bought the suitable kits for the season.) 

Who contributes more to the club? A. Who contributes least? C. 

Now, there are arguments that international fans do contribute in other ways, and I don't disagree. The fact remains, however, that the international fan makes significantly lesser direct contribution to the club in comparison to the attending fan, whether or not he cheers. 

The international fan contributes in buying kits and paying for sports cable subscriptions. Kit sales contribute very little to the club, the club has already benefited from the kit deal itself. Higher kit sales does help in negotiating better kit deals, however. For sports cable subscriptions, the amount the club gets is based on the number of live matches and also league standing. In all, it is pretty balanced, City got 60 million pounds, Liverpool 54, and Aston Villa 42 million. Not too much difference can be made there. 

Now we come down to the point you made about knowledge. So you read articles about Liverpool and discuss stuff about the club with friends and on the internet. How does that benefit the club? How do you think the 3.5k subscribers to r/liverpoolfc, or the 10k users of RAWK contribute directly to the club? If you're going to say that they ""spread the gospel"" about Liverpool, then you obviously haven't been to RAWK. 

Just because nobody has backed me doesn't mean I'm wrong, this isn't a popularity contest. There are several others who hold similar, or comparable views, but choose not to jump in because they know this is downvote haven. This last part is where I actually get angry: Lebron's ""investment"" was part of the deal that gave FSG his exclusive marketing rights worldwide.

The CoE doesn't function like that. It's a hierarchical organization so if a single church struck out on it's own and went against what the church as a whole was being told to do then it runs the risk of expulsion or excommunication. So yes there would be uproar, because it would be the state trying to overrule the word of god, and you would immediately cause a backlash from pretty much the entire church, including members who are actually in favor of gay marriage.

true,rgalzera,lfc68,,"first off. ill tell you what i havent done, berated fellow LFC fans and tried to call them lesser fans simply because they havent been to anfield and havent spent excessive amounts of money to give lfc the price of one ticket. 

secondly, just because your idea of what a fanatic is doesnt mean that /u/QuantoQuandoQuantro isnt entitled to calling himself one. It's pretty tough being able to even watch the team we love across the pond even now, 7-8 years ago would be even harder. As far as american fanatics go he probably is an LFC fanatic. 

as far as your fan a-c example goes, if fan c is anything like OP or me they would probably do anything to make it over to see LFC at anfield, but we simply dont have the means. if i ever make it to anfield i sure as hell wont take it for granted. and lets be honest if i dont go there is probably someone else there that would pay for that ticket. its a market that is always going to have buyers. 

also with the emergence of new technology like twitter and other social media fan C can make an impact on the motivational side.  any fan from america could send a player a tweet that comes at the right time saying exactly the right thing to give that player the motivation to score the winning goal of the game. now thats an extreme example but anything is possible. 

Anyway, being able to directly influence the club isnt what being a fan is all about. its about loving a team. who cares if someone hasnt been to anfield that doesnt make them a lesser fan. it might make them a lesser privileged fan but not lesser in quality. No one tried to convert me to LFC and i have no desire to convert anyone to support them but damnit if someone on the street yells ""liverpool sucks"" on the street while im wearing my LFC kit damn right im gonna yell FUCK YOU right back.

If you are going to look down on lfc fans for not being able to go to anfield when it is possibly one of their greatest dreams thats when it makes me mad. This argument has not been about measuring passion its been about you looking down on fellow LFC fans for not being able to go to anfield and being able to pay for one ticket at great personal expense. its the same way with religion. you wouldnt ask a homeless devote catholic to donate to the church to fuel the vatican would you? NO. would you expect that same homelessman to make a trip to the vatican and cheer for the pope at easter mass?

28-year-old Stewart Downing on the other hand is a bit more concerning: his poor play last season is a bit more troublesome. With his experience in the Premier League and as an international, he should not have been as rattled or whatever you'd like to call it by the pressures of Liverpool. Or his finances.

Carroll can possibly fit into Rodgers' system, sure, but with any player, you have to consider whether the money gained from selling them, when reinvested, leads to a better team than just keeping Carroll. When Newcastle sold Carroll the supporters were furious, but they reinvested well and are overall a better team for it than if Carroll had stayed. 

We have limited funds to improve the squad, and Carroll's valuation will never be this high again. He showed good form last season and at the Euros, there's still lots of time on his contract, he's young, and also FFP will mean fewer clubs are able to cough up figures of 15-20m. (I know FFP's already kicking in, but there's a grace period which really allows clubs to keep spending a fair bit- look at Chelsea).

Of all the Liverpool players that could provide a sizeable transfer fee if sold (Carroll, Agger, Skrtel, Lucas, Suarez, Reina, maybe Johnson), Carroll is currently the worst fit for what Rodgers wants to do. So if he needs to sell to buy, Carroll is the first to go.

I'd probably go with Blink for someone who's already a sci-fi fan.  It's great for showing how the show has great monsters, uses time travel in cool ways, and can be a bit scary at times.  On the other hand, if I thought someone was more likely to get into the show for the characters (especially The Doctor, obviously), I might be more inclined to go with The Eleventh Hour, as other people have said, because I think it's a great episode for showing off the show's characters without requiring any context (new Doctor, new companion, and much better than ""Rose"", the only other episode where both those things are true).  If I wanted to show off the emotional side of the show (or the history side of the time travel), Vincent and the Doctor would be a good choice, as most other emotional (possibly tear-inducing) episodes are the departure of a doctor or companion and obviously don't have the same impact if you're not attached to the characters.",0,1343363246,null,0,false,0,c5k2rw5,t3_x6whi,t1_c5k2rw5,t1_c5jzzjh,null,1429481372,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

 Tennant had a long and successful run as the Doctor, on top of being charming, quirky, emotional and lovable.  
  
Smith is, in my opinion, the strongest actor of the lot. His goofiness and zaniness is more reminiscent of what made the show so popular in the first place. He is a great mix of what makes the classic and new versions of Doctor Who so wonderful.

I'd like to answer your 2nd question together with your point about the difference in numbers between Scouse fans and worldwide fans, just to save time. I'm basically answering directly from my mailbox now, too much of a hassle to jump from post to post. 

One for one, the match-going fan makes more direct contribution than the one who doesn't. This is fact. Maybe if one day the tickets do cost 3000 pounds a match, the locals won't go. But then again, would anyone go? People like to have a go at the fans at Emirates and Old Trafford because they are quiet, but these are the people who allow them to earn close to 100 million pounds per year on matchday revenue. Again, I'm not saying I'd rather have 10 people paying 1 million per match than 45,000 noisy fans, there is an equilibrium to be found here. I keep repeating that the attending fan, regardless of how much you spent on the ticket, has the ability to cheer on the team. This makes them more important than those who don't even have the ability to. I'm sure on the night of Istanbul, Liverpool City centre was rocking with noise, and that fans worldwide were praying in front of the TV, but the actual fans who motivated the team were the people sitting in that stadium belting out ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" during half-time when we were 3-0 down. I don't think Rafa showed them how people were showing support on an IRC chatroom, or an internet forum, or a video feed of Liverpool center. It was the noise right there and then that struck right into the hearts of the players. At that point, in that particular moment, for that particular match, not a single Liverpool fan in the world was equal to those singing in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium. 

Globally, the group of international fans is surely larger than those who attend the matches. This is without a doubt. However, one international fan is a speck of sand in the ocean. How much of a loss would it be to lose 1 international fan? Surely lesser than the loss of 1 season ticket holder, wouldn't you say? The international fans hold an important part for Liverpool. They are the flesh, the bulk we need to get massive worldwide support and therefore large sponsorships and investments. The match-attending fans, the ones whose ""fandom"" have been passed down from generation to generation, those are the backbone of the club. If in 30 years, the club gets relegated to nPower division 2, and we've lost 80% of our international fanbase, these match-attending fans will be the ones who the club will rely on just to survive. 

I often hear a common argument from international fans saying that they make more of a sacrifice than local scouse fans because they have to pay for cable and watch matches at inconvenient timings, compared to people who are able to watch the match on TV in the afternoon, or walk down the street to Anfield. I don't view a Scouse fan who doesn't attend the matches and watches it on TV any different from an international fan. Living in Singapore, I know and understand the pains of having matches at inconvenient times. However, to compare that with someone who watches the matches? Does anyone think about the actual affluence of the city? Considered the sacrifices taken to travel for away matches, especially European ones? Someone who watches the majority of matches, home and away, literally spends thousand and thousands of pounds yearly, and yet some guy in America gets upset when told that he shouldn't call himself a fanatic when he can't even fork out $2000 over 6 years to watch ONE match at Anfield. My tone would have been spectacularly different if he had watched at least 1 match. I know how it feels like to save up money to fly thousands of miles to watch a match, I took 4 years to save up money for my 2nd Anfield trip, starting when I was 14. I would have praised him for it. His defensive attitude and continued insistence that he was a fanatic, however, just managed to annoy me. 

The funniest thing is that I have only ever experienced such defensive reactions from Americans. I know Liverpool fans in Asia who happily admit that they aren't fanatics, that they were envious of Scousers who got the chance to watch Liverpool weekly, and who hoped that they would one day go to Anfield so that they could officially call themselves real Liverpool fans. I've met people in China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Germany who all have similar sentiments. They know they can't be termed fanatics, and they have no problems with it. Is it because there is a relative lack of football culture in America? I haven't met anyone from Europe who called themselves ultras without the credentials to back it up. I once worked with someone from Spain, and when he told me he went to every home game for Atletico Madrid, I mentioned that he must be a die-hard fan. His response was that he wasn't even close, he's just a fan who loves the club. The people who go for every training session and away game and reserve game and pre-season game, those are people who will die for the club. 

Every single time this comes up, people think that I'm some lousy Scouser who can't deal with having fans from America, but I'm not. I'm just a fan from that million-strong fanbase, just like you are. All I'm saying, is that don't pretend to be a die-hard Liverpool fan when you're not. Don't call yourself a Kopite, or a fanatic. You are, in the bigger scheme of things, just another Liverpool fan, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Personally, I don't like the idea that the State gets to choose, as its interests don't coincide with ours.  I'd prefer that the parents choose, but they should be definitely be accountable to their child and arguably the community for the choices they make.  Whole swathes of the school curriculum are awash with politics - history is political, economics is political, hell, even PE is political.  Science seeks to set itself up as a special case in this regard, and to an extent it is, since it tries to measure itself against reality, but there are many instances when it hasn't lived up to this ideal (Nazi science being a good example), and even history tries to be objective.  I tell my children to tell their teachers what they know the teachers want to hear in order to pass exams, but to make up their own minds about the issues having read around them for themselves.

What a negative way to look at things. If someone says Christian Bale is the manliest man, do you take that as an insult to your manhood? 

The definition of ""fanatic"" is:

1. a person whose enthusiasm or zeal for something is extreme or beyond normal limits

2. informal  a person devoted to a particular hobby or pastime; fan: a jazz fanatic

I did a rough calculation and it takes less than USD2000 to fly to Liverpool for 1 night and watch a match. If somebody is unable to save up 2000 dollars over **6 years**, then your identity of being a Liverpool ""fanatic"" is the least of your problems, because that's less than a dollar a day. 

&gt;also with the emergence of new technology like twitter and other social media fan C can make an impact on the motivational side. any fan from america could send a player a tweet that comes at the right time saying exactly the right thing to give that player the motivation to score the winning goal of the game. now thats an extreme example but anything is possible.

I like this example, because you're right. There are always exceptions. Someone could be an avid writer who puts up a great blog advertising Liverpool. Or he might have his own personal expertise and fanbase (like a pro-gamer) and make use of that to promote Liverpool. He might go to great lengths to set up the local chapter of a Liverpool fan club, and do things like set up deals with pubs for Liverpool fans, or organise a donation drive for charity that promotes the club etc. These are, however, exceptions, and I have found no reason to consider OP an exception. 

Using your definition, anybody can claim to be a fanatic fan, and no one is allowed to doubt it. I mean, what's there to show for it? Words on the internet? ""I'M A FANATIC BECAUSE I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT IT!"" and that's it? Okay? Doesn't this belittle the actual fanatical Liverpool fans? The Kopites? Can you imagine somebody saying ""Hey you spend a big chunk of your paycheck every year and take regular annual leave and spend tons of time watching every Liverpool match in person, I've never seen a Liverpool match in person before and I am equal to you!"" to a Kopite whose held a season ticket for 20 years? 

There was a reason why I asked him for his age first. If he was 15, I wouldn't have said a thing. This isn't about me belittling Liverpool fans. The whole ""some fans are more of a fan"" came from Cymro87 who mentioned an old comment of mine and me explaining it. This is about someone who claims to be a ""fanatic"", who has never been to Anfield after 6 years, and is immediately defensive when I literally said:

&gt;While I don't doubt that you're a fan, I think you might not want to call yourself a fanatic.

And that's the only way for a culture to be valuable?

Germany, France, Poland, Austria and co all seem to be in pretty good shape at the moment, despite that happening to them.

Fair enough. Doesn't explain your continued defence and explanation of Romney's actions though. It's no secret you have conservative leanings from reading your previous posts on r/UK so you can see why I may have thought that.

&gt;I think it's crazy our obsession with US politics, as though we can do anything about it. 

I'm not sure anyone is suggesting that we can. Doesn't mean we can't discuss it. Due to the size and power of the US, whoever they have in power can have significant ramifications for the rest of us (especially with stuff regarding foreign policy, border control, trade agreements [ACTA etc.]) so it's quite understandable that people are interested.

&gt;If I was a betting man I would say Romney is likely to win the election, and we will have to face up to that fact.

I do indeed lean conservative, but my concern is more the inconsistency of the reddit community. For whatever reason, Obama is a saint who cannot be criticised. On the flip side, we will upvote an out of context quote from a book Romney wrote years ago, in order to support our preconceived notions that this guy is evil embodied, whilst Obama is our saviour. 

The truth is there is a biscuit between them, and Obama makes Cameron look like a green party candidate.

With the ABC circle-jerk that is r/soccer, it boggles my mind to know that people actually think MLS&gt;Chelsea or somewhat. It took a nations best collection of players to scrape a controversial win over a 2nd string team IN TRANSITION. The Era of Mourinho's boys is reaching it's end, and a new dawn of potential and talent has been carefully brought through in the wake of our greatest triumph. Smug anti-chelsea fans can sneer and jibe all they want, when deep down, with the hate out of their eye, they wouldn't think twice about having our squad in their shirts ( maybe bar Terry ;p). Our squad, blessed with the greatest owner in football, I HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.  
  
now to discuss what i honestly feel what our team needs is a coach that will drill THE SHIT out of the new generation, bring them together and fight for every win from whistle to whistle. Yes, call me delusional and obsessed with Mourinho, but watching clips and interviews when him and players speak about the team, It's evident they would do everything and anything for that team, they were united and had the mental strength, which i feel has carried them over the years since Mou left. I know i shouldn't be recalling on past glories or what not, but for me, being a great people person/man manager and letting players play how they want/park the bus doesn't cut it for me. Then again, Pre-season is like reading the menu before dinner, you see what looks and sounds good before you eat. so like every manager, I'll give RDM a chance.

The only justification for their lack of legal monopoly is the very recent introduction of secular marriage, which I'm surprised they didn't oppose more.

What they are saying is that the tenancy may be better to end depending on the work involved. It may end up that the whole roof needs replacing along with all the ceilings and any chimney rebuilding. This can take months in which time there'll be no protection from the elements save a tarpaulin and possibly no electrics from time to time so basically it would be uninhabitable.

Whilst they legally have an obligation to sort out temporary accommodation this could be a room in a B&amp;B with your belongings going into storage - something which I think you'll agree is less than satisfactory.

If it does end up being that serious then finding somewhere else is probably a better option than months of upheaval. However it may not be that bad and could be repaired with minimal disruption to you which is why they're asking that you give them the chance to find out the extent of the damage to save you unnecessary aggravation as much as them.

However I would say that over a month without any significant process, i.e they know whether or not it needs a full re-roof or just remedial repairs, is not on.

[The Manifesto: Who We Are and What We Mean](http://www.fc-utd.co.uk/m_manifesto.php)

&gt;*FC United of Manchester is a new football club founded by disaffected and disenfranchised Manchester United supporters. Our aim is to create a sustainable club for the long term which is owned and democratically run by its members, which is accessible to all the communities of Manchester and one in which they can participate fully.*

&gt;*Although driven by very different circumstances, FC United of Manchester takes as its inspiration a number of supporters' groups who have gone down this route, including AFC Wimbledon, who have offered unstinting support.*

&gt;*FC United of Manchester is intended to create a football club which addresses the concerns which many Manchester United fans have had over the last decade or more with how the club and football have developed, culminating in the club's takeover by Malcolm Glazer. We will follow the best traditions of Manchester United's past by developing policies which encourage youth participation in terms of both playing and supporting.*

&gt;*FC United of Manchester will be formed as a member-owned, democratic, and non-profit making entity on the Industrial and Provident Society company model. The EGM will focus on the election of a board of directors by the members, and the direction of the club over the coming season.*

&gt;*We have ambitious and long term plans. Above all we want to be seen as a good example of how a club can be run in the interests of its members and be of benefit to its local communities. However, we are a new club and will require patience in order to reach our goals. With the help of all our members and supporters we are confident we can achieve them.*

&gt;*Seven core principles of how the club will operate are set out below, and once agreed by the membership, will be protected by all elected Board members:*

&gt;*1. The Board will be democratically elected by its members.*

&gt;*2. Decisions taken by the membership will be decided on a one member, one vote basis.*

&gt;*3. The club will develop strong links with the local community and strive to be accessible to all, discriminating against none.*

&gt;*4. The club will endeavour to make admission prices as affordable as possible, to as wide a constituency as possible.*

&gt;*5.The club will encourage young, local participation - playing and supporting - whenever possible.*

&gt;*6. The Board will strive wherever possible to avoid outright commercialism.*

&gt;*7. The club will remain a non-profit organisation.*",0,1343385350,null,0,false,0,c5k6686,t3_x824w,t1_c5k6686,t1_c5k5zhr,null,1429483020,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The only certification that actually looks decent to me is the RHCE and that's because it's not prohibitively priced and the testing consists of a day long practical exam. Everything else is just multiple choice or dodgy JavaScript simulators. Most people I know with certifications passed them by buying TestKing books and memorising the questions or something similarly dodgy and find it very difficult to function in an actual work situation which seems to defeat the whole point of a certification in my opinion.

[The great myth of urban Britain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096)

&gt;The urban landscape accounts for 10.6% of England, 1.9% of Scotland, 3.6% of Northern Ireland and 4.1% of Wales.
&gt;
&gt;Put another way, that means almost 93% of the UK is not urban. But even that isn't the end of the story because urban is not the same as built on.
&gt;
&gt;In urban England, for example, the researchers found that just over half the land (54%) in our towns and cities is greenspace - parks, allotments, sports pitches and so on.
&gt;
&gt;Furthermore, domestic gardens account for another 18% of urban land use; rivers, canals, lakes and reservoirs an additional 6.6%.
&gt;
&gt;Their conclusion?
&gt;
&gt;In England, ""78.6% of urban areas is designated as natural rather than built"". Since urban only covers a tenth of the country, this means that the proportion of England's landscape which is built on is…
&gt;
&gt;… 2.27%.
&gt;
&gt;Yes. According to the most detailed analysis ever conducted, almost 98% of England is, in their word, natural.
&gt;
&gt;Elsewhere in the UK, the figure rises to more than 99%. It is clear that only a small fraction of Britain has been concreted over.

The fact is, many ""conspiracy theories"" turn out to be true, however unpopular and vociferously dismissed they are when they're first posited.

* [Maybe the USS Maine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_%28ACR-1%29#Sinking), but whatever the actual cause of the explosion, it was certainly exploited for propaganda purposes by the press, as were the sinking of the [Lusitania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania) and the dubious events in [the Gulf of Tonkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident).

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"The problem with being 'fairly certain someone did it' is that that is based on a gut feeling based on evidence which if it isn't conclusive still has a margin of error.

Retrospect with regards to repeat offenders who could have been caught the first time but there was insufficient evidence provokes an emotional response . Realistically, the first time, your acquaintance may actually have been innocent. Of course as he's been arrested, he wasn't, but the evidence in later cases convicted him. Each case has to be taken alone otherwise you could end up judging someone based on character and not actual evidence.

If you cannot prove that someone is definitely guilty, to force them to henceforth announce they 'may be guilty' is as good as, if not worse, than sending them to prison for something they didn't do.

We should seek to maintain the stance that everyone is innocent until proven to be guilty. Creating a 'not proven' status, to me, looks more like a 'limbo' status that I would hate to inflict on anyone.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Nah it was beautiful. Hardcore politics is indistinguishable from hardcore bitching.

Cameron was in a tough spot politically: A guest has just insulted the our/his capability to host a party. One the one hand he doesn't represent the US, so it isn't a big deal; on the other he might actually represent the US soon, which means it can't just be accepted. The comments were fair and true criticisms; but it was still rather rude to make them. Brits love to complain and moan and criticise their own country; but we are going through a patriotic streak with the Royal Wedding, Jubilee, and Olymics all coming through in quick succession. Romney did successfully host the Winter Olympics once so he is kind of qualified to make these comments; integrating the Olymics into one of the busiest cities of the world is much harder though.....

Cameron would have looked foolish to directly respond to Romney's comments - he isn't important and to do so would have been making a big deal out of nothing and come across as overly defensive over true points. However the media was already making a big deal out of Romney's political rudeness and Cameron has been working hard to stir up national pride for the events, he'd lose a lot of face for not responding to rudeness on the eve of the big moment; furthermore if Romney does gain power in the US then this previous interaction would have lasting damage to the international relationship.

His response was perfect - it accepts the criticism and doesn't deny it but puts it in a fair perspective (of course things will go wrong when you have an event this big in a city this compact and busy). If you want to read into it then it *also* says ""London is where the international community is focusing on right now. It's an important city and it's looking good; yours doesn't really compare."" but ofcourse that is all in the mind of the reader and it could never be proved that Cameron told Romney to sod off.

Saying Andy has none of the attributes to fit into his system is dead wrong. Having Suarez and a Borini playing off him on the wings could work out. You really don't know until you try. His passing is underrated, not ideal, but certainly not poor. Him holding down the ball and springing Suarez and Borini actually sounds quite good. With his confidence on the rise, his finishing could be better as well.

I understand he really doesn't fit the ""fluidity"" of a 4-3-3, but at the same time, if you're expecting a Barca-esque 4-3-3, you're taking the piss. Not one team in the world will/can truly play like them. 

And finally, about the transfer purse, these owners can go get fucked if they're looking to be cheap. Understandably they cannot throw money around like City, but you just hired a new manager with a new system. Also, we've picked up a number of new sponsors, not to mention the fact they decided to embark on a tour of the US during the same summer as two major international tournaments.

Their wallets aren't hurting at all.

true,rgalzera,lfc68,,"by saying someone is more of a fan that has to mean that there has to be lesser fans. by using a superlative and grading fandom you automatically imply that some are greater and some are lesser. as far as the example you gave about christian bale, the difference is you didnt give a reason why he was the manliest. if you wouldve said christian bale is the manliest because he has brown eyes then youre discounting people for reasons beyond their control. 

saving money isnt the only problem limiting people from going to see a game. family obligations work and other things also limit people. especially family. if someone with a family wants to go to liverpool to see a game the cost rises dramatically because its most likely that they would have to bring them along to liverpool.

first off im not claiming anyone can be a fanatic, OP could be a fanatic and the fact he hasnt been to anfield doesnt mean he is'nt, it's other factors. Also as far as your example of a 20 year season ticket holder being more of a fanatic than OP your probably right. its not because they have been to anfield. the sacrafic that person makes is great and the fact that he thinks that sacrifice is worth it speaks of his fanaticism. there are probably other factors that make a 20 year kopite more of a fan than OP. words on the internet dont make him a fanatic but his life outside does. we dont know OPs deal, you cant lesser his fandom because of his limitations. if he would go to anfield one time that would not change how he felt about the club or make him more of a fan. he would feel awesome because he went but that wouldnt change his status and make him more of a fan. would the 20 year kopite be more of a fanatic than OP if he had been once, probably, but now they have both been to anfield. are we going to start gaging fandom by how many times they have been to anfield?

Lastly your example of being a fan of in-n-out is totally different. what makes in-n-out something to love is its burgers. LFC is way more than anfield and seeing them in person. like i stated earlier about me going to a roma game because i had the opportuniy. it wouldnt make me more of a roma fan than an extremely passionate Roma fan in the US. The same goes for LFC.

EDIT: i will agree that some people use the word fanatic wrong but you cant say OP isnt simply because he hasnt been to anfield. my roommate last year claimed to be a fanatic MUFC fan. problem was he was an idiot and knew nothing about their current team or past teams. he just liked the title. im pretty sure he hadnt been to old trafford but that wouldnt make him not a fanatic. the fact that he was an idiot and i knew more about Man U as an LFC fan made him not a fanatic. A trip to where a team plays doesnt solidify fandom or fanatic status. you said you had no evidence that he was a fanatic to soldify his claim, you also have no evidence that he isnt a fanatic (other than not being to anfield)",0,1343398008,null,0,1343399574,0,c5k7zx8,t3_x74b4,t1_c5k7zx8,t1_c5k3ffs,null,1429483890,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I find people who bitch about UK weather hilariously naive. I've put up with negative 40C prairie winters, blood heat 100% humidity Asian summers and 45C desert summers that went on for months. The UK has one of the finest temperate coastal climates in the world.

Other stuff the UK does well. Racial integration. Compared to the USA, there's way, way less segregation and distrust between blacks and whites. Especially, I see so many black/white couples compared to the US, which is just lovely. The race achievement gap in schools is much smaller. Open racism is way less common. 

Generally this country is really tolerant. My east asian (chinese) friends do report a bit of uncomfortable stereotyping. As a gay, I've never encountered problems here, compared to people yelling faggot at me outside gay clubs in the US and harassing me and my boyfriend occasionally. 

Looking after people down on their luck. US cities are fucking full of toothless homeless drug addicts, often veterans. UK, not so much. Essentially zero fear of gun violence, although it's true you're more likely to be mugged in the UK. At least you won't die. And my God, Americans would give their back teeth to have something like the NHS. (Those that have teeth. You meet a LOT of Americans with missing teeth, because they can't afford checkups!)

Near to really interesting places. This is particularly awesome about the UK. You're a stone's throw from really different and interesting cultures in Europe with thousands of years of history. There's nothing you can compare to this in other english speaking places.

On politics and religion: all I can say is Brits, don't get complacent. The USA's cultural influence is fucking malign on this stuff. Nutball American Christians are starting to spend big money on corrupting British schools and churches into their Wahhabist brand of religion -- and fundamentalist Islam is a bit of a concern too. Speaking as someone who had fundamentalists protesting about abortion down the street from him every weekend for years, I can say Brits don't want this.

This might all seem one sided in favor of the UK. Overall I do prefer the UK to other countries, but the USA does a lot of stuff really well, especially considering how many more people they have. Just having a semi-working developed democracy of 300 million people is pretty fucking impressive all on its own. If the UK was 5 times bigger, it would have many of the USA's problems with political inertia and special interest group politics too.",0,1343398421,null,0,1343401679,0,c5k83aq,t3_x8evz,t1_c5k83aq,t1_c5k6fgb,null,1429483924,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

It's easy to make the Drogba comparison due to their similar builds and Andy's potential for a late bloom, but, as we are increasingly seeing, LFC is now being run like a business more than anything and we have a risky asset sitting around that is probably going depreciate in the near future in this new system (and I'm basing this on a lack of statements from Rodgers' pertaining to Andy in the future of the club).  It seems like selling him is the most likely option regardless of who we are getting to replace him.

true,jestalotofjunk,lancashire,Lancashire,"I think you are really underestimating the cost effect of treating a heroin addicts and locking them up. People also very rarely go to prison for drug use today anyway. It's the crime they commit to get the money to fund their habit which often gets them sent to prison. Decriminalisation wouldn't mean you could set up legal sales of drugs. It just mean it's not illegal to use the drug. You're confusing legalisation and decriminalisation which may be close in parts of their understanding put completly different in law. Thus a heroin addict would still be out breaking into houses, mugging people, stealing cars, selling themselves for drugs.

With this it would not stop the money flowing into the war on drugs. The majority of organisations taking tax payers money are using the funds to stop international drug movement and major organised crime. Which wouldn't be stopped by decriminalisation. 

Back to my original point. It sound fine on paper but funding this sort of treatment is to expensive and political suicide. Before this changes we need to educate and change the public ideology and the way they view addicts in our society.

Most analysts have estimated that Brendan has a moderate budget of money he can spend, but a sale of a big striker would justify a large increase in his transfer budget. 

Regardless, like you just said, fitting in the system is obviously the biggest factor in estimating a player's relative worth (especially considering FSG wants this to be a long-term plan).

My though process is that Rodger's is looking to play primarily on the ground with much fewer crosses and long risky lobs (or ""Charlie Adam Hollywood passes"" if you will).  Andy can finish with his feet, but he is nowhere near clinical enough to be the player we rely upon upfront.  His strength is in the air using his strength, and even that is diminished by the fact that refs allow him to be constantly fouled in the box during set pieces to no consequence.  Additionally his mere presence threatens to derail the system early on as players (Adam, Downing, Henderson etc) are getting used to being comfortable on the ball, they will surely panic and just lob it at him, creating dissonance in the system.  

I'm sure this can be ironed out before halfway through the season, but Rodgers is also aware that he can't waste half a season.

In this, one player is a dedicated defensive midfielder, he sits right in front of the back four and wins the ball and distributes simply. This is the so called ""Makalele Role,"" after our very own Claude Makalele. This player has little attacking responsibility. He is often more defensively minded than the outside backs even. The other player is then free to position himself as he pleases. This player often plays a box-to-box role, like Lampard did in his younger days, or a deep-lying playmaker role, like Andrea Pirlo.

[Double Pivot:](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=866)
In this system, both players play as ""holding midfielders,"" with defensive and attacking responsibility being shared. Often one will break forward and one will stay, but these roles are not pre-defined. A good example of this is Schweinsteiger and Khedira for Germany.

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","I don't think you're getting what I'm saying. Have the police actually made any mistakes in convicting him? They got the wrong result, but perhaps by doing exactly what they should have done.

If they found a bloody knife, covered with his fingerprints, he had a motive, three witnesses say he and his daughter had had a massive argument, he was seen leaving her house around the time she was killed, etc etc, the police produce all that black and white evidence in front of a jury, the jury may well think ""we're beyond reasonable doubt he did it"". Even if he's innocent.
 
Now, if the police didn't do their investigation properly and missed (or worse, covered up) crucial evidence that would have proved his innocence, that's different (as I said, I don't know specifics in this case). 

I'm trying to think of a good analogy. The best I can do is, hypothetically, if you sell someone a car with faulty brakes *that you've no way of knowing if they're faulty or not*. The brakes fail, they have an accident, its hardly fair for you to be held liable for their accident.  
Or maybe a surgeon who kills a patient who has a condition the surgeon was unaware of. The way I'm feeling about your argument is that you're saying the surgeon (police) should simply have run more tests to find this condition, when realistically its almost impossible for them to have known.

I'm talking in hypotheticals, I don't know any details of this case, the police might have fucked up time after time, in which case this entire conversation doesn't apply.  
I'm no fan of the police, and I'm sure there's a good chance that mistakes/conspiracy to get this guy lead to him being jailed. But its also entirely possible he was just unlucky. ",0,1343410416,null,0,false,0,c5kba3q,t3_x8mzz,t1_c5kba3q,t1_c5kak9s,null,1429485427,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It is not that we think they were directly responsible and had this not happened, we accept that there is a good chance she would have died anyway. But that is no excuse for the poor care, the complete lack of communication with us leading up to her death and not even consulting with us before deciding to list her as DNAR. 

We are not looking for someone to blame for her death, but there is a chance that her care, or lack thereof, contributed toward her ailing health (we were told she was stable) which subsequently led to her death. Bear in mind, the builders had no information on her condition and for all they knew their activities *could* have led directly to her death. This is what needs to be addressed.

The workmen created an atmosphere that was extremely unhealthy for someone so weak with pneumonia. 

The workmen should not have been in there, so why were they? 

Helen Blanchard claims that the Junior Sister accepts responsibility for this. But I don't believe the entirety of this falls on her.

There are so many things wrong with this situation that I am unsure where to start.

Why were we not told how weak and close to death she really was? Why was her Parkinson's consultant, who was based at the same hospital, not brought in to ensure any medicines and treatments would not adversely affect herself or her long term medication. 

Why was the Sister under such heavy work load to make this mistake?

In fact, when you put it into perspective, the first-team midfield trio of Green-Norris-Austin (give or take Brown and Pugh) is much stronger than Clayton-Brown-Pugh (give or take Howson and Vayrynen).

Perhaps the only thing we're lacking is players with the passing range of Clayton and Howson, in fact I think that Austin is the only player capable of playing defence-splitting passes - but that's only from what I've read.

However, the reason why I'm not so happy is because I'd like to think that we can sign better players than him, not to mention that he's on the wrong side of 30 and a year has passed since we last tried to sign him. So why we've got him on a three-year deal is simply mind-boggling.

I'd (friendly) disagree, you wouldnt have a solid idea of what we were capable of when the league was mostly even before billionaires started to take over. It also helps to know where you have come from to see where you are going, by seeing how we used to play and how successful we were its obvious what changes have caused us to fall in recent seasons.

&gt; **English fans seem to have a hard time understanding that the world of football is changing.**

Please, lose that thought process immediately, the English and the prem set the standard for football 

&gt; **What your club won in the past is becoming less and less important**

worst attitude to have, seriously, I say this as a friend, that is a poor attitude to have, you should take pride it what we accomplished as it made us the club, name and image we are today

&gt; **how your club is set up financially and how well they do in the eyes of the world is now becoming more important.**

Im sorry but I feel you have missed the whole point of football.

----------------------------------------------------

I dont understand why you feel the need to be so competitive against other fans? Just because you supported liverpool since we have hit a rut doesnt make you a better fan, Ive supported Liverpool for 29 years and seen it all but I wont use it against other supporters because thats not what we do.

thinking the game is all financial is very stupid, you could make the point that arsenal do well financially and they come 3rd most seasons but what do they complain about? not winning trophies.

They did several of these with the First Doctor: Marco Polo, The Aztecs, The Reign of Terror, The Romans, The Crusade, The Myth Makers, and The Smugglers.  In fact, it wasn't until the 17th story, The Time Meddler, that they ever combined science fiction with a historical setting.  Before then, it was always one or the other.

The Second Doctor had one straight historical with no SF element other than the Doctor himself, a story called The Highlanders.  After that there were none until a Fifth Doctor story, Black Orchid.  And none at all since then.  It's like the BBC or the producers had a higher opinion of their audience in the Sixties than they did later.  Nowadays they're afraid people will be bored by realism and always need aliens and monsters.  As an SF fan I find that insulting!

&gt; **I appreciate your willingness to not be insulting. I feel like I'm developing quite the chip on my shoulder about being an American supporter.**

Im sorry you feel this way, I really really do. Being a US supporter doesnt make you any less of a supporter than those of us who live in liverpool, we both love the same thing, but we should never ever turn on one another.

Also sorry for this format, just makes it easier to reference and respond.

----------------------------------------

&gt; **Sorry, been getting a lot of attacks lately for being an American Liverpool Fan.**

I didnt know there was a problem like this and im ashamed if there is or has been because we're all doing the same thing no matter where we are and live, supporting the club we love.

You have to remember football is a VERY VERY big deal here in England and Europe on a scale that I dont think a lot of US supporters can quite understand, for some people football is all they have, need and love.

&gt; **I didn't say I'm not proud of what Liverpool have accomplished. I just meant that to the rest of the world it matters less than what we are currently accomplishing. My point is that in order to continue to be a competitive club, we have to be seen as a big club and our history will only do that for so long (ask Forest about history).**

The thing is Liverpool achieved so much in the past it was ridiculous, in the late 70's &amp; 80's we were pretty much the best club in the world. We won it all, then won it again and again but as time went on the level of play forced other teams to adapt and get better, thats why the prem is so competitive today (not COMPLETELY because of us but it did help). 

You came just after the CL win and you were right to say we did decline but you really did miss out on what we were doing aswell as a lot of the changes to the club, prem and the game overall.

Arsenal finish 3rd pretty much every season but have not won anything in 8 years, in 8 years we have won 6 cups, including the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FA cup and Charity shield. We're 1st in cup wins in the last 8 years and 2nd overall of all time, but all that alludes us is that damn prem league crown which we came so close to winning in 08/09 this is why you hear fans so desperate for it and maybe this is why you think we need to be focusing on it, we do but you need to remember were also very famous for our tournament wins.

&gt; **As for Arsenal fans...the ones that complain, I think they are idiots.**

Their not Idiots they are passionate fans, they want there club to win and you should admire them not mock them for that. Back in 2000-2005 Arsenal were performance wise the 2nd best club in the league, they were killers and they won the prem undefeated. 

Fans still expect Arsenal to do what they did when they won the prem unbeaten but they havent been able to find a full squad that can do what they used to do. They are just frustrated.

&gt; **Birmingham beat them to a trophy recently....I wonder if the Arsenal fans want to swap fates with Birmingham?**

Ive seen League 2 teams beat United, Liverpool and Chelsea in the FA cup many times, it happens to us all.

&gt; **Your point about what Liverpool were capable of before the league was all billionaires isn't a good point....because the league is now all about billionaires.**

I think your a little confused here,

Only **3** teams have billionaire backers that have spent a billion,

Man city and Chelsea's owners both spent over **1 billion** pounds to win the league,
Man Utd won the league by consistently spending between 60-80 mil every season but the Glazers have put about put about 600 million into them

Only Arsenal have a billionaire backer but they are **not willing to spend billions in order to win**.

(Side note! When chelsea first did get their billionaire owner Roman, they literately bought the league. This had a huge backlash because it became heavily unfair to other teams as they literately did not have the players or the spending the Chelsea did and chelsea became boring to watch)

You see the difference between city and Chelsea is that both City and chelsea have NO/ZERO limit of what they can spend, their backers are multi billionaires and do it for glory rather than profit. 

Liverpool are very rich team wise but again our backers like the rest of the prem are in it to make money so we have a limit on what we can spend and because clubs like Chelsea and city spend so much on their players this has raised the overall price of players making getting new players much more expensive.

-------------------------------

Liverpool will ALWAYS be famous for its history, Always.
Its the same reason Man U fans keep boasting about 19, its our history that makes us, its that history that makes our rivalry so heated.

Also it may have been just a bit before you started following, but Billionaire backers **REALLY , REALLY** almost ruin the game. They took all the fun out of watching, Chelsea went from mid table to unbeatable overnight, it would be pointless watching teams like west brom play them when one of Chelsea players were bought for the combined price of the whole team.

Many young people spend more money going out on a Friday and Saturday night than it does to fund a habit but many are just to lazy to earn the money to pay for it. It never made sense to me as by working to pay for it you know you will have a reliable source of income to pay for it whereas by stealing I imagine making money is hit and miss.

I'm currently in drug treatment as it's time I started behaving and I have actually found doctors willing to treat my chronic pain that I have been self medicating for decades. 

The main benefit of legalisation is that the heroin would be a known quantity and free from dangerous additives like cement dust which is sometimes used and can mean that peoples limbs need to be amputated or worse.

It basically means you can pivot around 2 players instead of one. If the left cdm is in possession then he is pivot and vice versa. In reality most teams employ a modified midfield 3 instead of a true double pivot. One slightly more attacking cm who can get into strike zones, one passing cm whose main job is being open for passes and being the playmakers and a defensive cm who screens the defense.

Beijing was beautiful and creative whereas this relied on referencing creativity. It was as if Danny Boyle was in a contest to put as many cultural references as possible into a 90 minute show. But they were all so brief and fleeting that they left no lasting impression. 

Anyone unfamiliar with British culture during the poorly edited mix of songs will be switching between thinking ""Oh i know this"" to ""Oh what is this- oh wait it's gone"" . There's no lasting impact to it. What's the point in referencing things, it was an overload of information.

I'll admit I did enjoy the Industrial sequence, but after that it was all,in my opinion, downhill. Of course there were fleeting moments of greatness, but they were just that, fleeting, as soon as you had taken something in, something else grabs your attention, allowing for no time to contemplate.

I also feel it was centred on Southern English culture far too much, I admit it is the London Games, but when everyone else is footing the bill ,you'd hope for a bit more diversity.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; those were all bargains

Agreed, terrific deals.  But they can't be the rule.  You can't put together an entire team of fortuitous 8-10 million pound bargains.  Maybe that's what Levy wants to do, but it's simply not possible - not for a team with serious Champions League aspirations.  Like I said in my (long to the point of being unreadable) post, Vertonghen was a potentially world-class player interested *only* in playing for Spurs and willing to push for that move until Levy got his price.  That's not going to happen with anyone else.  Sooner or later, if we want *the right players* - not just the best bargains - we're going to need to actually meet a club's asking price.  I'm genuinely not certain Levy will do that.

&gt; not so that we could get Moutino, but because I'd rather seen that money be spent on 1 or 2 top class strikers.

I don't think those are mutually exclusive, or they shouldn't be.  Our net spend for the last few transfer windows (including this one) has been virtually nonexistent.  We've sold two center-forwards for good money in previous windows and not replaced them.

Once they've questioned that person, they should then come to a decision, again based on logic, as to whether or not there is a genuine threat.

Oh wait, that's actually EXACTLY what happened and the police decided that it was not a credible threat.  Then, for some bizarre reason, the CPS chipped in and overrode that decision.

We have a wage structure because that's what we can afford. And while I would love to just say ""fuck it, pay Ade"" the second we do, Bale, Rafa, Kaboul, probably Lennon, Benny, and all our other top players who are making our current top wages will come back and demand that same money.

In major cities like London they are acting like a protest group (but never admit to it, so they can avoid any legal issues), and use tactics like Corking and mass ""swarming"" to allow them to openly break traffic laws. Spin off groups like Critical Manners in SF have been created for the sole reason of these people merely going for a ""bike ride"" routinely breaking the law, to encourage groups to stay within the rules.

It may have started as a simple gathering of fellow cyclists, but as always happens in large groups, there are enough participants using it as an avenue to cause disruption in their aim to promote respect and equality for cyclists on the road (ironically), or just because they can.

that is in the communist manifesto, right at the top. i know a of people like that idea, but it means giving up your rights and property, something i think belongs to you, not some interfering government.

a competitive market always brings better results for everyone when compared to something government 'gives'. i am in a very small minority, i know that, but at least there's a few of us fighting for everyone's rights against big government.

That being said, I will personally guarantee you two signings before the window closes, and I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with four or five. Levy and AVB aren't stupid, they know where the holes in our squad are and they will fill them with players who are good AND good value. Which is why our windows take so long to get moving.

And the fact that we do it so well, which is the reason we can even consider ourselves a top club, is testament to the work our Chairman has done over the past several years. 

We trust in Levy because he's done it before, over and over, and he can do it again, and because there's no other option for us.

true,SpasticPanda,flair2,,"&gt;we need to be spending big on world-class

Spurs are not a huge market team. I think that you need to really understand this in order to move forward with your argument. Sure we can all salivate about the huge players which get linked to us, but this is just inevitable. It happens every year. You need to just expect it.

Levy refuses to take on large debts, and refuses to make silly, high risk player experiments. This is why the club is so financially strong. And this is such a good thing. It means we will never have to fire sale players to pay down debts. It is also partly the reason that the biggest failure that we have ever had is probably Bentley. I'll accept that. In fact I will smile about that.

Levy is also ridiculously stubborn. But how many times has this been a good thing. The Modric saga last year was the perfect example. Too many times I see ""Lets just sell him...buy more players"". Why on earth would we do this? Would you sell a bottle of amazing scotch, well under value just to get it over and done with, so you could buy two bottles of unproven, possibly terrible scotch? And in the continuation this year, the same is true. Levy is selling him for the best possible price, in the best interests of the club. How can anyone argue with this?

&gt;Does he really expect to sell a 40-million-pound player and replace him for 10 or 12 million?

He bought Modric for what, 20 million pounds. There are players out there who are undervalued. They exist. Van der Vaart is another brilliant example. Gylfi is another. Vertonghan, I would argue, is a world class defender. 9 million pounds. These signings changed the nature of our team. Did we have to spend 30+ million on supposed 'world class players'? No. We bought players with purpose and fit and they made (will make) an impact.

Bottom line, Levy is unwilling to spend because it is in the best interests of the club to ensure that it is viable long term. This is also in the interests of the fans. The need to splash huge amounts of cash is also well overrated. I wouldn't call you an idiot, but I'd say you don't know much of the Levy history, and you are very much a one way street fan. 

Having said that, it can be frustrating, but everyone just needs to take a step back and remember - Levy most likely knows more about this sport and the way clubs need to be run that the entirety of this subreddit. Lets give him the respect that he deserves with regard to that knowledge. COYS

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; Sure we can all salivate about the huge players which get linked to us, but this is just inevitable. It happens every year. You need to just expect it.

I think you're taking that phrase to mean that I genuinely expect bids for the Hulks and Falcaos of the world.  I don't.  I'm well aware that those players are beyond our means and I never took those rumors seriously.  I'm talking about 24 million pounds for Moutinho, 22 million pounds for Damiao - not necessarily those players specifically, but players of that reputation and in that price range should be attainable.  Not for every position, obviously, but one or two from time to time should not be outside our means.  Several years ago we were paying money not *too* far removed from that for players like Modric, Bent, and Bentley - has our situation worsened so much since then?  Is our buying power so much less?  If you adjusted for inflation and for changes in the transfer market, in fact, I'd suggest those transfers would appear even *more* expensive.

&gt; Levy is selling him for the best possible price, in the best interests of the club. How can anyone argue with this?

If rumors of a 33 million pound bid are accurate, I believe it is in the best interests of the club to take that bid as soon as possible, the better to begin shopping for a replacement and stabilize the squad.  If you're telling me you expect Levy to hold out for 40 million, even if it means waiting until August 31st, I would *not* say that's in the best interests of the club.  I think it will have a detrimental impact on the start of a vital campaign and will prevent a real replacement for being purchased.

&gt; He bought Modric for what, 20 million pounds.

A little under 17 million pounds, I believe.  What's the relevance of that?  It's not like he was known to be a 40 million pound player then and Levy just managed an incredible bargain.  If you're saying he could be replaced for 20 million pounds, it's entirely possible that's true.  I said 10-12 million pounds, which corresponds to the bid made for Oscar and the price being suggested for players like Moussa Dembele.  To pretend I'm unwilling to countenance the purchase of a 20 million pound replacement is to avoid reading my argument.

&gt; Van der Vaart is another brilliant example. Gylfi is another. Vertonghan, I would argue, is a world class defender.

Yes, again, the same three examples everyone is using.  These kinds of purchases are never going to be the rule.  You cannot make targeted acquisition of necessary players by holding out for these kind of fortuitous bargains.  It was a matter of blind luck that a CB the caliber of Vertonghen was coming to the end of his contract the summer we needed a new defender - and if Vertonghen had been willing to countenance a transfer to any other club we would *never* have gotten him.  What would Levy have done then?  This is a pertinent question because there are no good strikers in Vertonghen's situation.  Given that we *need* two players in that position, what do you suggest?  As wonderful an eye for a bargain as Levy has, he can't conjure those bargains from nothing - he can only make those deals where they exist to be made.  If there are no such deals, what do we do?  How does the squad get what it needs?  Vertonghen is probably a world-class player, VdV certainly was, but no world-class strikers under unique circumstances available for peanuts.  Only excellent strikers available for the asking prices of their clubs.  If we're categorically unprepared to meet those prices we should never have sold our other strikers to begin with.

&gt; I'd say you don't know much of the Levy history

It was under Levy's chairmanship that 17 million pound transfer fees were agreed for Luka Modric, David Bentley, and Darren Bent, not to mention 15 million for Jermain Defoe, 14 million for Pavlyuchenko, 12 million for Wilson Palacios...We've come a long way since those purchases, and certainly should not be aiming any lower than that as far as player quality.  If it was clear to me that Levy was willing to sanction prices even *that* high for the players we need I would have no problems.  8-10 million apiece will not get us the players we need, though.  Not in every case, and I think *certainly* not in the case of strikers, whose price tags are inherently much higher.

&gt; a one way street fan.

I don't know what that means.  If you're suggesting that I'm asking Levy to gamble the financial future of the club for short-term gain, I'd suggest you're caricaturing my position.  There is a middle ground between the club going under and the club never taking the slightest risk on the transfer market.  I'm obviously not arguing for the former and if you're arguing for the latter, I have to disagree.",0,1343435766,null,0,1343436962,0,c5khuxp,t3_x9pkt,t1_c5khuxp,t1_c5khh2f,null,1429488595,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

First of all, it's going to be a lot less friendly, and crime is high compared the rest of England, so far above and beyond most places in Canada. It's going to be small cramped and smelly in comparison as well, not to mention the weather. Always expect anything when it comes to English weather, it'll go from sunny 30C, to hail within seconds. 

Nottingham does have a good night-life, and some pretty awesome pubs. As you're new to the city, I'd recommend spending most of your time out near the city centre, around market square. It's the nicest, and the safest part of the city.

Depending on the sort of job you're after, you may run into some difficulties, as you'll be competing with a lot of students looking for work in the city, both part time and uni leavers. 

I might not have come across as too positive about the city, but I'm actually rather fond of it, everything worth going is pretty centralised, and the public transport is far better than anything in Canada. 

A good pub to visit is the Ye old trip to Jerusalem, it's not the best pub, but is one of the oldest in the world and a bit of a tourist attraction. I'm rather fond of The Bell just off Market Square although it's not for everyone, and somebody below recommended The Ropewalk, I'll back that up, they even have retro gaming consoles that I'm a sucker for. All British pubs are an order of magnitude better than Canadian ones though.

It's partly my fault. I expend all my good karma in /r/gallifrey, and all that's left to post in /r/doctorwho is snide. Especially after that post about ""Sometimes we forget he's just one man"" turned out to be three men, and not eleven. And especially after *this* thread, where there was so much - and, dare I say, too much - of a negative reaction that there wasn't *enough* of a *Doctor Who* tribute, or enough of a **specific** *Doctor Who* tribute.

It was in that light that I read your post. An unfair light, truth be told, and one that might have obscured the nuances of your original intent, that being one that desired a more general appreciation for *Doctor Who*'s contribution to all things British, as opposed to whining and pining away for, as I stated above, something more specific; which, as I also stated above, is regrettably far too endemic in this thread (and has, on numerous occasions in both the distant and recent past, been a subject of contentious discussion and debate), and might well be for the present and near future until the commencement of Series 7.

So I do believe apologies are in order. Or, more to the point, I'm sorry that I assumed you were part of the David Tennant Brigade, when this is evidently not the case: you simply wished that *Doctor Who* had been better recognized and acknowledged during the ceremony. And while I am satisfied with the level of attention the show was given during the opening ceremonies, it's certainly a minor point of detail upon which we can agree to disagree with no harm done either way.

I thought Amy was... OK. For the most part she was 'standard plucky companion' but she evolved to have a bit more depth. Rory, however, was a total dark horse character who came from very standard beginings to become an entirely unique character in the Whoniverse. Just his presence in an episode made an effect on both Amy and the Doctor. He was the archetypal human companion written *right*. He wasn't written as a plucky sex idol, he was written as a plausible human who became something amazing just by getting caught up in the Doctor's orbit. I think that's what the show is all about. I also think it's a tad unfortunate that this mainly seems to happen with male characters, as if the writers can't comprehend writing a female character who is not a sexpot or tragic love interest first and foremost. Donna was the only comparible companion, but unfortunately Rory was barely treated with full 'companion' status.

•Waits a total of 50 years (36 of which did not 'stay with her')
•Obsesses over a man she met and knew for one night, for twelve years, making dolls and mock ups
•Ignores Rory for most of their lives until they are mid-late teens and ""a friend"" tells her Rory has loved her forever. 
•Finally gets together with him, has the most wonderful man she has ever known/met, decides to marry him (doesn't seem too excited about it)
•Doctor eventually returns, she throws herself at him, and leaves with him in her nightie on *the night before her mother fucking wedding, marrying Rory*
•Gets pisses because she had to wait 36 years on her own, *when she knew about the different time streams and the fact that it was neither the Doctor's nor Rory's fault*

Rory:
•Seemingly wimpy, but a real badass
•Waits 2000 years alone for the woman he loves (in a fucking Roman's get up, need I remind you-uncomfortable), protects the Pandorica from harm, pulling it out of fires and assorted dangers (heavy D: )
•Does not get mad/upset/whatever *because* he has to wait 2000 years
•Is incredibly in love with Amy, it seems more than she is in love with him
•Stays behind, loyal to Amy (except maybe that Flesh episode, but he was a bit upset with her..), when she goes off and does whatever with the Doctor ('hey sexy, you're back! Now have sex with me against the TARDIS in my bedroom on the night before my wedding!' ಠ_ಠ)

true,THR,lfc50,,"It might have been the most successful to date but by no means was it the first. Renault *is* a major car company. Many other companies - Ford, Volvo, Toyota etc have had demonstration vehicles available well prior to the Volt's release (I'll concede that they are demonstrations rather than actually retail available). But the point remains that it is *not* the first, and they are not years ahead as you claim.

If you go through Europe, most of the plug-in vehicles (which are available to hire as car-share vehicles) are Renaults, Peugeots or the like. 

&gt; **In 2003**, Renault began selling the Elect'road, a plug-in series hybrid version of their popular Kangoo, in Europe. It was sold alongside Renault's ""Electri'cité"" electric-drive Kangoo battery electric van. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elect'road

&gt; On December 2007 Ford delivered the first Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid of a fleet of 20 demonstration PHEVs to Southern California Edison.

&gt; GM officially launched the Chevrolet Volt in the U.S. on **November 30, 2010**, and retail deliveries began in December 2010

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid

&gt; As the ghost of GM's assassinated electric car haunts a fearful Detroit, another boogeyman is waiting in the wings: the world's first mass-produced plug-in hybrid electric car, being readied for its December release -- in China.

&gt; BYD, a company that first made its reputation as the world's largest maker of cell phone batteries, has announced it will release the F3DM hybrid sedan on **December 15 [2008]**. And BYD says it plans to release a version of the car in the US and Europe in 2010 or 2011, just when GM plans to begin selling its own plug-in hybrid, the Chevy Volt.

Job wise depends on your line of work, experience and expectations. What are you looking for?

Good pubs - The Lion Inn in Basford. Live music, local brews, good clientele, and known throughout Nott'm for its live music - open mic nights, acoustic sets blues and jazz, etc. Centre of town, go for the old pubs - The Bell Inn, Olde Trip, Salutation, etc. There's a Brewdogs opened here recently that's supposed to be good but I've never been.

Avoid Wetherspoons, specifically the one on the Market Square, as it's invariably full of scum and the food is awful.

The Chameleon is quite a cool place for music if you catch it on a good night (it's always either totally empty or rocking). Up the alley just near The Bell Inn and up some stairs.

Riverbank is quite nice because it's by the river (surprise!), but it's expensive and usually full of people in too much aftershave and fake italian shoes.

I'd rather a business man be at the helm, as they know how to make money.  Now, don't think that, that means we are a ""selling club"".  I think Levy genuinely is more interested in residual income over a lump sum here and there when we finally have a gifted individual that we bought on the cheap.  I think Levy saw the money we got from CL, the money we can get from a larger stadium, and with Under Armor ( a US brand), I think he is trying to break into the US market...

We all know that we messed up with Carroll and his transfer fee, but the as big messup IMO was giving him such a large long-term contract. To be worth that much money he has to be a guaranteed EPL striker that you don't have an ounce of doubt in. 

If you defend him as a player who is developing, then we should have signed him on 20k a week and sent him out on loan. 

This deal is happening, I am just worried that Carroll won't take it and cause some problems because of his contract and we will end up having to buy him out for £5M or so. That may be why we are holding out for more.

As soon as he goes we have £10M p.a plus another £20M in space to bring in players.

If that was written in the FAQ then anything not within those lines could be deleted if we had enough mods to do so.


That way all the bases are covered. At first, I thought it excessive, but you know what, it's not hard to type brackets and S#E# and it will save everyone hassle, heartache, and being pissed off. You just automatically draw the line at new who and not worry about constantly moving the line. Or you do it for all of who and for old eps you can just specify which doctor. I don't think we need to put the word ""spoilers"" in every single title for any season that contains a spoiler. If we just decide to make all posts in the [S#E#] format then those who have not seen it Be they a day behind or brand new to the series, they will know to avoid it if they haven't seen that ep. 

At first, I was just angry and thought the same way about ""well if it's been a year they should've seen it"" but many people (including myself) did / do pick up Who much later. Now should they join a subreddit if they're not caught up? Probably not, but it takes 2 seconds to write the season and ep number after your post, and it'd keep everything clean and tidy. The biggest thing is pick a way and then enforce it. 


We need a tag that basically means spoilers / speculation for future episodes. Because many people like to speculate, talk about Moffat tweets, find tidbits of leaked or potential leaks. And some people don't like it at all but click because they think it's something actually pertinent to dates or times or something of new epps. Again, saving heartache with a simple fix. 


Both of these I think are important because I know I for one may put something within a post and forget to use the internal spoiler tag but I think that simple rules should fix any potential oopses from that because people won't be in that thread if they don't know what goes on in S6E2 because it was tagged. And it would also solve the image spoiler issue.

Recap:
A. Always use [S#E#]

B. If it is about hearsay, spoilers, or speculation for a future ep use [SPOIL] or whatever tag is decided.

C. have enough mods to be able to actually patrol and enforce.

D. Don't put spoilers in titles

He's about to fetch enough from the sale of Luka Modric to buy us Joao Moutinho and have a few million quid left to throw at Ade to make sure he makes his move to us permanent.

After that, we could do with one young striker, and we're looking really solid.  Vertonghen has helped shore up the gap defensively and Sigurdsson gives us some flexibility when it comes to Lennon and VdV.  Both of them look like really good buys.  Add in someone with youth and possible long-term benefits like Damiao and I'd say we've had our best summer in a while.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"1. Shouting ""Fire"" in a theatre has a clear intent which is to cause immediate panic to a specific group of people.

2.  Tweeting what is very obviously a joke (note the use of words like ""Crap!"") shows no threatening intent and no cause for panic to a specific group of people.

What you're doing is comparing apples and oranges.

&gt;That's why these things have to be taken seriously, even if they later turn out to be a joke.

And, as I've already pointed out, it WAS taken seriously.  The police spoke to him and satisfied themselves that there was not a credible threat.  The CPS decided, for reasons known only to themselves, to take the matter to court.

&gt;the guy was ill advised to do it in the first place, and yet he's being hailed as a hero instead of an asshole

I'm not sure that anyone is particularly hailing him as a hero; rather they're celebrating the fact that, finally, common sense has won and it's time to consider whether financial remuneration is appropriate for a man who seems to have been the victim of the CPS acting on a point of principle rather than a valid threat to the fabric of society.

I'm just really tired of the same old shit and I'd like you to shut up. I'm sorry... it's not the subject matter it's just... people like you on these crusades. I'm not up for hearing it ok.

true,fool_on_the_hill,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"In general, your ability to hear the difference between accents depends on familiarity (and, therefore, proximity) to the regions they come from. So I could tell the difference between a Texan and someone from New York, but might not be able to pin down a Southern US American accent to a particular state. This is why imitating accents from another country is very hard: It's common for Hollywood actors performing English accents sound 'all over the place' to people native to Britain, because they end up munging together a few regional accents that sound distinct to English ears (I have seen sources suggesting the UK has a slightly higher than normal accent gradient though, so maybe it's particularly challenging). English actor Simon Pegg used a 'generic' Scottish accent (a mix of Edinburgh and Glasgow) in his role of Scotty in the Star Trek reboot a few years ago, which sounded perfectly acceptable to English ears but might have seemed odd to Scottish viewers (although he was coached by his Scottish girlfriend).

An English person referring to ""Northern"" accent would typically mean an accent from the North of England; e.g. Paul McCartney (Liverpool, although the Beatles often sang in American accents), Oasis (Manchester), or the Arctic Monkeys (Sheffield, in Yorkshire). Anyone native to England could easily distinguish between all these different Northern accents, but may well consider them to have a certain amount in common and may well sound the same to someone not native to Britain. If you asked an English person to mimick a generic ""Northern"" accent without specifying where, they'd probably perform a Yorkshire or Mancunian (Manchester) accent, since other regional Northern accents such as Scouse (a *subset* of Liverpudlian - yes, accents can vary within individual cities) or Geordie (Newcastle) sound more distinctive to English ears.

A Scottish accent is very different to a Northen English accent, and the two would not normally be lumped together by anyone British (I also struggle to imagine how they'd sound similar to someone not native to Britain). Glasgow and Edinburgh do have different accents, although most English people probably couldn't recognise them (but probably could tell the difference if hearing them side-by-side), and would probably identify either as generically 'Scottish'.

The worst part of the NBC coverage was the despicably idiotic commentary DURING the show (not even during the transition parts, they talked over musical parts of the show). They politicized almost every country and spoke negatively about everyone. When Kazakhstan came up, they talked about Borat. When Iran came up, they talked about nuclear weapons. They talked about Kim Jong Il's golf game when North Korea walked. NOTHING about the athletes. And then there were these nuggets of awful announcing:

""This is another part of the performance I don't understand.""

""This is the United Arab Emirates ... (silence) ... they come before the U.S. because of the alphabet.""

I don't see the relevance of the NHS in a story about things quintessentially and uniquely British. The industrial revolution started in the UK, and other segments seemed to have their logical place, but pretty much every country in the world has an equivalent of an NHS, there's nothing particularly remarkable about ours, and we certainly weren't the first to develop one. I think the reason it was included was because of recent political posturing about the make-up of the NHS. The proverbial microwave-dinner of patriotism. It's already been prepared and cooked, you just need to heat it for a few minutes to get a result. Cheap.

If the Olympics were being held in the 80's or 90's, it is quite possible organisers with a message to push (or a lack of imagination at the 11th hour) would try and shoe-horn BT or British Rail into the act to get a cheap reaction.

nottingham born and bred here,
There are significantly varied social groups within notts like most british cities, you've got chavs, skaters, rockers, punks, a few mods and ska's still, and a mass of others... now depending on what type of music and stuff your into there are different pubs and clubs to checkout as you would expect, im a bit of a rocker and i love the Pit and Pendulum pub, deffinately a rock/metal pub, does some of the best burgers ive had in town at lunch, also has an underground dungeon style seating area with underground bar, ""Pit'n'Pendulum"" or ""P'n'P"" is also known for its awesome cocktails and custom shots, predominately the 7 deadly sins

But yeah tons of great pubs around notts, also got 2 fair sized shopping centres, Victoria Centre and Broadmarsh, also got several good highstreets that branch out from the central square with loads of shops to cater for every taste, also got a small shopping centre just behind the town hall (the place with the two lions outside it) which i think is a designer place but it gets overlooked alot by people for some reason. bit random but if your looking for a good suit go to Slaters, just off market square all suits are tailored and almost all are designer label, gotta dress to impress if you wanna work somewhere nice...

In terms of employment like someone else said it depends what your really looking for, alot of temp work and low level stuff is taken by students, there is a place called Blue Arrow on Friar Lane that is a temping agency style gig, they hire for alot of stuff but that 'office' on friar lane is specifically looking for admin and office based vacancies and they typically look for people with that kind of background work. 

there is also a plethora of cafes and stuff everything from starbucks to costa, some next door to each other, one good place that recently opened is an internet cafe / gaming cafe place on King Street, owned by a mate of mine whom i believe is also redditor

but yeah if you want to know anything else give me a shout on this page or pm and ill be glad to help

The purpose of marriage, marriage negotiations, and the effects on the married couples' lives, families, etc. have always been secular.  The influence of religious groups on celebrating and recording marriages has waxed and waned.  For example, (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#History_of_marriage_by_culture)), ""From the early Christian era (30 to 325 CE), marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter, with no uniform religious or other ceremony being required... starting in the second half of the 16th century parental consent along with the church's consent was required for marriage... As part of the Protestant Reformation, the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state, reflecting Martin Luther's view that marriage was a ""worldly thing""""

&gt; There have been unions for a very very long time, but marriage has been a primarily religious institution for a very long time itself.

Absolutely, because there were binding ceremonies / unions for a very large part of human history, in many other cultures and times.

Marriage as a concept is something which did exist in the early part of the 1st millennia, but was crystallised by christianity over the course of a few hundred years (Yes, I know this took 'till about 500, hence my saying 1500 years and not 2000).

You can't get away from this fact that there have been about 1500 years of them completely owning the concept, and the idea that that OK, it took a while to be crystallised as it was and then in the last 30-40 years some people moved away from that doesn't go nearly far enough to demonstrating the idea that marriage is not a christian thing, and it can't, because marriage as we have it essentially *is* a christian thing.",0,1343477628,null,0,false,0,c5kogv9,t3_x4j8i,t1_c5kogv9,t1_c5koeac,null,1429491787,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

As for what the US does ""for"" the UK, the majority of US foreign aid is distributed to countries that were formerly occupied by the UK.  The vast majority.  I believe, and I may be wrong by a small margin, that foreign US aid to countries formerly controlled by the British Empire exceeds the entirety of UK foreign aid - and the UK gives the second highest amount of foreign aid in the world.

The vast, vast majority of US bank bailout monies has gone to European banks, including British banks.  There's a hell of a lot more direct benefit to the UK than to the US in doing this, tho obviously the US benefits greatly.

Depending on where you look, the amount of US aid to countries that were once part of the utter disgrace that is the result of the British Mandate for Palestine is in the trillions of pounds.  The simple fact is that Britain *cannot* fix this situation, period, despite creating it.  You may not like the US's decisions in this area of the world (few do), but the UK has offered no better solutions to the shit storm of its creation.  If a major regional war broke out, the UK could not effectively intervene.  IT simply does not have the fire-power, the monetary resources, or the influence.

I could go on, in consideration of the US being the largest source of foreign aid for both Eastern and *Western* Europe (both of which has more direct impact on the UK than the US), but you get the point.

I absolutely don't agree with all of the US policies.  I do agree with the general intent: stability.

It's undeniable. Western companies now issue throwaway laptops and mobiles when going to China because it's virtually inevitable that any medium or high ranking business person will have all of their electronics bugged and all of their data harvested.

true,reddditoor,null,null,"&gt; Absolutely, because there were binding ceremonies / unions for a very large part of human history, in many other cultures and times.

&gt; Marriage as a concept is something which did exist in the early part of the 1st millennia, but was crystallised by christianity over the course of a few hundred years (Yes, I know this took 'till about 500, hence my saying 1500 years and not 2000).

Do you have a source for any of this?  I really don't think anybody else makes this distinction between non-Christian ""unions"" and Christian ""marriages"".  Marriage didn't just exist in the early part of the 1st millennium, it has existed in pretty much every known human society.  It didn't become ""crystallised"" by Christianity, the institution went on evolving as it always has done.  Perhaps most importantly, it went from being a transaction between two families, in which a man took possession of a woman from her father along with a dowry, to a contract between two equals.

&gt; You can't get away from this fact that there have been about 1500 years of them completely owning the concept

no it isn't. you do not have the right to other people's money, that is called theft.

&gt; nowhere has anyone even mention politics.

apart from me, that's because i know what i'm talking about - the NHS is something called social care that's provided by government. when we talk about government we are talking about politics, that's just the way it is.


&gt; [if i] break your leg, have a heart attack, or get in a car accident, which service is going to be resuscitating you and taking you to a hospital to save your life?

the second rate NHS service that i'm forced to pay for, that doesn't make it right, can you see that point? just like if the mafia makes me pay for protection i'd be forced to go to them if some other idiot tries to extract money from me.

a free market beats central planning every time, i'm afraid, both in freedom and quality. even right now the NHS is second rate when compared to our private care and that's without much competition happening. just think about it for a second. i'd rather have better care at a cheaper price wouldn't you? i at least want to be able to have a choice and not have it made for me by force.

Yes, because the Krays were black. Good one. As were the IRA. Not to mention, none of those people in the ceremony are responsible for that. Are those critics of the ceremony not intelligent enough to realise that not all are the same group? Also, what better way to deal with gun crime and gang culture in the black community, than complaining about the black people that steer well clear of it and strive to do well for themselves, by appearing in things like the Olympics, and embracing and contributing to our culture and values.

The reason they bought Torres is because of Rafa Tika Taka variation system allowed quicker more agility based players greater movement and freedom and with players like Alonso and Gerrard feeding through we thrived as we didnt need to rely on fixed positioning. 

Speed kills in the Tika taka, we bought suarez to play with torres but he left before Suarez arrived. 
Both Torres and Suarez cutting through and feeding off one another would have been incredible.

Borini, Suarez and (lets imagine we get him) Ramirez are renowned for their speed and Agility style playing, preferring to cut through players than playing around this is where they are similar like i mentioned, so rather than having two players cut through we play with three up front and with the tika taka system the three of them should be able to cut through most defences pretty swiftly both creating and making chances.

Andy Carroll is not renowned for his speed or agility, he's a power house player, somebody who does not get bullied by defenders, he may struggle to keep up with the pace and speed of tika taka

&gt;They've retreated to a place of their own and said ""this is pretty shitty"" and people, for some reason hate that.

&gt;Black men don't commit more crimes that anyone else. They certainly, in some environment commit more crimes per capita than the average

Which is, in a simplified manner, exactly what he's saying. One doesn't need to look very long at race and crime in say, the US, to make the point he made. He's also correct about the downvoting and unpopularity of facts on reddit - whether his is true or false is irrelevant to that point.

&gt;but when these discussions take place there's no room for context, or discussion about causation.

Yes, there is, there's plenty of room. That doesn't mean a fact isn't a fact though. Facts without context aren't as useful as those with, but that doesn't mean they're false because we don't like them.

&gt;Explain the difference to trying to offend me by calling me a nigger

They're not trying to offend you, they're trying to offend everyone who can be offended. Those who are left, can have frank discussions about anything without complaining about facts they don't like, or their emotions being hurty. That's part of why 4chan discussions work so well. No-one ever bothers complaining they're offended and no-one has the power to silence people simply because they don't like the facts that they're spouting.

&gt;By dismissing it as something 4chan does it's like it's OK to offend me as long as it was deliberate.

Again, not you, everyone. For instance they take it further by calling everyone a fag, Amerifags, Eurofags, Britfags - they're as offensive as they can be all the time because that immediately excludes those who take offence, leaving only those for whom that won't get in the way of anything.

&gt;Is this irony?

No, it's racism, quite clearly. So what? You want to be shocked at people being racist on the internet? I mean come on, I know I spend hours on this site arguing, but seriously you're going to bother wasting your time caring about every last shit head?

&gt;the care and treatment is second rate on the NHS, that's just a fact.

Private care is better? No doubt - you pay for such a thing. But the NHS as parasitic because it doesn't have adequate resources? I am not sure that is a sustainable position.

&gt;I think Reddit forgets that we're in the minority in this country. Vast swathes of it oppose multiculturalism

I don't buy that. That's only about 5 million of 60 million population. Not to mention, he's alienating Brits from one another, driving wedges between communities. And yet tries to act like he's being a patriot. I could understand if he were complaining about gun crime. But he's just complaining that black people were present. Which is just not rational tbh. We could do without that sort of little Englander mentality. It helps no one.

&gt;He's not alienating all fellow Brits though. He's alienating people who hang around on Reddit and Guardian readers.

It doesn't take a genius to work out that in order to get the best out of players you *do* in fact need them to trust in you and your system. On top of that, when you carry on losing games while spouting this kind of stuff to the national media, it shouldn't come as a surprise when the owner is unhappy with your approach...especially when you're owner is someone as notoriously impatient as Abromovich.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;by supporting the NHS. we are having our right to choose where to spend our money taken and given to an uncompetitive service by force. if the NHS were an opt-in service that would be fair. plus, if the NHS is so good why are we forced to pay for it rather than it being voluntary? it's because the private sector would win hands down. the government can get away with it because most people can't understand what's happening and they don't have the foresight to know a free-market gives a better, fairer cheaper service.

This paragraph is the epitome of the ""Fuck you, got mine"" libertarian philosophy that prioritises the individual. Why should YOU pay for the NHS that everyone else uses? Well, because a great deal of them wouldnt be able to pay for the inflated prices of private medicine. You are ""forced"" to pay for it because by and large people who are not sociopaths dont mind giving up a small amount of money to be secure in the knowledge that they or anyone else can walk into a hospital and receive treatment regardless of their financial circumstances.

The private sector can compete on some things, namely waiting list times. Their ""client"" list is much smaller since each private hospital only deals with a smaller userbase instead of NHS hospitals that have to encompass a wide area. For an all-encompassing service the NHS has been assessed to be pretty damn good value for money worldwide. It also doesnt leave people on the street to die because they cant afford treatment.

Free markets dont exist. Any market scenario is influenced by factors that rig the game, whether by reason of geography, opportunity costs, regulation or whatever. Even if they did, the natural progression of free market capitalism is to create a monopoly as companies grow, merge and repeat, eventually leaving a few monolithic corporations that are so similar as to remove that element of competition - in short, the libertarian free market you advocate allows companies to maliciously rig the game in their favour, devoid of regulation. 

ld rather pay my tax and have the NHS.

&gt;most people here know our politicians are self-serving and we have economic problems, but lack the wisdom to know the solution. they think more government controls are the answer, well they are wrong. giving away freedoms never helped anyone, but the people taking the freedoms. it's really not difficult to work out!

Why yes, deregulation is the answer! We'll just handily ignore the fact that such deregulation primed the pump for the recent financial crash in 2008. 

We'll also ignore that (as an example) before regulations were introduced and imposed by the government with food standards, manufacturers could get away with selling a loaf of bread almost a third by weight of sawdust, and sausages with barely 5% meat in them.

i explained a private-sector  free-market in my last post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/x9l4l/fuck_yeah_nhs/c5kpqz2). throwing more money at the NHS is not solution especially as we don't have the money and it will only be taken from the unborn, they shouldn't suffer for us without giving their consent, something they can't do, obviously. 

what we need is competition for services, something that will bring better care and bring down costs. that is how a real free-market works, we all benefit from it.

surely you've heard about all the bureaucrats pushing pens at the NHS? they are dead-weight, taking our money to justify their existence, driving up costs and bringing down care. people taking their money from government are the only people that benefit from our taxes, not us, of course they will continue to tell us we need them, they are living a great life - they have guaranteed money that we have to go in to debt to give them.

&gt;the mafia comes to your door and tells you they are going to protect you for a fee, if not your business 'might' burn down.

Why yes, the NHS is directly like this, because if you dont pay them to heal you, they come around and give you cancer.

&gt;the government comes to your door and tells you they are going to protect you (NHS) for a fee, if not you are going to jail.

...but they dont. They imprison you if you evade your taxes in general since that way youre not contributing to the society that has had a large hand in allowing you to reach a taxable age.

&gt;the government services have no competition - no reason to provide a cheaper, better service because there's no competition. in other words your money is taken by force and given to a an uncompetitive service.

As it happens the NHS is one of the most efficient services for reducing mortality rates on pound per pound effectiveness worldwide.

http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/07/JRSMpaperPritWall.pdf

&gt;now, picture this - i am the only person allowed to run in the olympics 100m final. i have no competition and no reason to improve. i finish in a time of 6 minutes 20 seconds and spark up a spliff half way down the track to celebrate. everyone thinks i'm the fastest in the world, but Bolt, in Jamaica, says he's the fastest, everyone would think he's crazy after watching me win the 100m final. i am the NHS and Bolt is the free-market, subject to competition and ever improvement. because no one can imagine someone running so fast they just can't believe it's true.

This is a retarded analogy, conveniently ignoring that in the UK you have the option to go private if you wish - having a parallel 100m track with Bolt on it, and you on the original one.

You pay for the use of the original track, and if you can afford it you can go onto the parallel one.

If you're getting it on with your fellow freshers, take precautions (again, common sense).

As for going back to before the event happens, once The Doctor is involved in an event he can't go back in it's timeline, because it would end up causing a paradox. Obviously this is kind of put into question in The Pandorica Opens and The Big Bang and I think that's what caused the Tardis to actually explode and reset the universe, I'm not sure and It's likely that that explanation is wrong. If it is then idk how to explain how The Doctor went back in his own timeline during those episodes.

My advice for what its worth -

- Don't stay too close to Kings Buildings as it's vortex will suck you in and you will never see the beautiful city. if you stay half way you stand a chance on having a life as well as good academic results.

- For bus routes use lothianbuses.com; there is an iphone app which is very useful.

- use the Accommodation Services in Edinburgh university. http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/accommodation-services/

- Find some temporary accommodation to stay for a few months then move in with people who you get on with. For a PhD you need people who are cool with occasional hibernation for study. This is better than dorm living.

- I knew quite a few people who preferred to live with non academics. Worth thinking about.

- places between george Sq (arts campus) and KB are worth living in.
http://goo.gl/maps/AJzIS

- Learn what tenements are.

- Do not try and match people drink for drink when you arrive.

- Bike is a good idea. Horrible in winter though. FInd out what the hours of daylight are in December (hint very very small) compare with July hours though :)

- A single apartment will cost arounf £500 a month for something two bedroom and standard.
