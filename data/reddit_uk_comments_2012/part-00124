true,ChristofferOslo,NO,norway,"Written by Jeremy Clarkson on TopGear's webpage: But then, one day, my wife gave birth to a boy who, for no genetic reason that anyone can fully understand, has grown to be fanatically interested in the fortunes of Chelsea. And, of course, that sort of means I've had to get fanatically interested as well.

Just last night, the two of us settled down to watch the Blues play Liverpool. And it was like being plugged into Drax B. There was the horror of the early goal, the tension of Chelsea's thwarted fight back and then, in the final second of added time, the orgasmically joyous own goal.

An own goal! Not only had Liverpool been effectively knocked out of the Champions League, they'd done it to themselves. My boy and I did a jig round the coffee table. We punched the air with delight. And as the camera zoomed in for a close, high-definition look at the culprit, we could see the misery, the agony, the grim realisation that he was a complete and utter failure. That he'd ruined everything for himself, his club and indeed a whole city. This made us jig about with joy even more.

And then they showed us pictures of the crowd. The boy and I stopped jigging for a closer look. It was even better than we'd expected. The whole Kop was a sea of misery. God, how we laughed. We hadn't laughed so much since Manchester United were knocked out of the Carling Cup by Coventry City. We hate Manchester United. We think Rooney's ears are ridiculous and Ronaldo is a big girl. Indeed, my boy came home from school the other day and said: ""Dad, do you know what the three best words in the English language are?"" ""Manchester. United. Nil.""

true,Theinternationalist,null,null,"1. Fair point about the aging and experiencing things differently.  Moffat himself mentioned how Smith did a good job of being an old man in a young man's body.  In some ways, it screws with his lifespan since he spent hundreds of years in the Hartnell body, but only a few in Tennant's.  Fair, and yes I realize Pompadour's ""dance"" was probably offscreen.  As odd as it is, considering he first met her when she was Amelia's age...

2. Girls are icky?  Interesting conclusion, if incorrect and, even if you were right, completely irrelevant.  I'm more interested in literary competence and innovation, and I think we've explored the ""20something female falls in love with the dashing 900yr old Alien blah blah blah"" enough as is.  I'm not saying that the companions should not have an interest in the Doctor, it's that the ""Youngin' Love the Doctor"" subplot is overdone and the writers seem to have hit a rut in it.  River?  More interesting- and not because she's some sort of Timelord (that's what Romana was for).  It's because time passes oddly for them, so when she met him she had the heartbreaking realization that he knew nothing about her.  It's because the Doctor realized that *he* was River's target, and that he had accidentally given her the name River Song.  They have such awkward moments and they have to fight through it to have the relationship they want.

2a. Compared to the horizons left in explaining the Doctor-River relationship, I feel like we're done with 20somethings and the Doctor.  We've had unconditional love, unrequitted love, and psycho, not all written that competently (I got especially tired of Martha's Rose subplot).  I think taking the Donna break (note: STILL female, STILL flirty) was a good idea, with Amy being a good take on the subplot (if one that's overdone now; she should have left the show in Season 6- she and Rory don't feel that useful to the plot anymore).  If they can write Oswin/Clara/whatever well, okay- but I'd rather they tried something different this time.  Maybe more of a father/daughter relationship, the Jenny he never had the chance to have?  Maybe we'll luck out and she'll be a Lesbian (that sounded way less charged in my head) and see the gender politics involved with *that,* especially if they go back far enough in time to certain periods (one Persian shah was advised to ).  Maybe they'll axe Torchwood and Sparrow rejoins the team, which would bring something new to the table (unless the censors kill it first).

Or maybe we'll go for the ""ultimate ick"" and have a male companion who's gay for the Doctor.  Then we can see just how long it takes for the American religious right to get it off the air in the US :0.

true,railu,tennant,Tennant,"Excellent response.  One of the things I'm getting used to is that there really aren't going to be many resolutions to the romance plots in Doctor Who.  Unresolved sexual tension can give a plot a lot of mileage but it's not something that can be easily integrated into Doctor Who without invoking the Legion of Concerned Parents; which I find odd because they don't shy away from inferring homosexual attraction.

Conversely, I agree that a change is needed and Rory's dad might be a good start.  Indeed, we've explored romance but something we haven't explored a lot is if someone became more of a paternal figure to the Doctor instead of other way around.  His deadpan delivery contrasted with the Doctor's flamboyancy would make for interesting drama and also be a potentially good paternal relationship arc.  The 10th Doctor had shades of a father-son type relationship with Wilfred but it came out in the end more as two old soldiers reminiscing.

Also, Craig.  I would be ecstatic if Craig made a return because they are like two misfit children getting into trouble.",0,1347570031,null,0,false,0,c67rnac,t3_zrr4m,t1_c67rnac,t1_c67r9ca,null,1429891988,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

daleks being scary, a future companion playing a role as an actor before they are a companion, title of the episode is a naming convention of many classic Dalek episodes, making the doctor a brand new enemy to his old foes, ""remember me"" as a theme- let's remember 50 years of the Doctor, etc...

true,thelotuseater13,null,null,"1. My CV is exactly 2 pages long. The first is split into education and work experience (my experience is limited however so you may need more) 
The second page talks about skills, so team working, leadership, communication etc... Just touching on them briefly and saying any further achievements as well as qualifications such as languages etc. 
2. Bullet points and short sentences are best as many jobs have hundreds of applicants, so reviewers aren't going to look over every word, they are looking for 'buzzwords' and specific things, so dont over explain through the use of adjectives etc.
3. I would just say you have a full valid work permit and if you are planning to stay here long term, maybe touch on future plans. One reason I have heard that non-Eu citizens can get passed over is the idea that they may leave and not be a good investment for the company, therefore by showing you plan to be in it for a good time can allay those fears.
4. I have a BA so thats what I go into most detail in, then I say my grades in A levels as some jobs (even with a degree) still require good A level results which is stupid in my opinion. My GCSE's are just on one line and just say 10 GCSE's graded A-C including Maths, Science and English. Its not a lie and my GCSE's were good, I just am not using up space explaining them all. For a US High school they may not be relevant or useful at all to a British employer and they probably will not even take the time to find out how to convert them, therefore its most likely a waste of space for you, concentrate on your post-graduate and undergraduate qualifications.
5. It can't hurt to work with recruiters/Agencies. If you are in a specific field, such as areas like Railway Engineering, recruitment agencies are a must as they pretty much all work through them (Currently work for a company that does this, so first hand experience) If its a more broad speciality like a Humanities subject at University, then your chances with an Agency are less likely but nevertheless not impossible. I wouldnt rely on them though. :)",0,1347573911,null,0,false,0,c67sjyz,t3_ztzpc,t1_c67sjyz,t3_ztzpc,null,1429892416,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

true,badspyro,null,null,"Well, first of all, everyone is autistic to some extent. Welcome to the world.

Second of all, a significant number of people with Downs Syndrome do integrate with society, requiring little more help and care than a significant proportion of the OAP population.

As for the people with autism or Downs stacking shelves of pre-packed, sealed, hygienic goods, ignoring the baseless statement that they aren’t hygienic, who do you want to stack the shelves, doctors? Nurses? No, you want someone who finds that fulfilling and at their intelligence level and doesn’t have skills or abilities beyond that level. This way, you can have progression and development.

I also never said that they are not a burden. They can be a burden, but as is a political system, a religion, a monarchy, large corporations and an army. And that’s before I get down to prisoners etc. However, there is a cost to benefit ratio, and what I was explaining was the fact that the equation is not as one sided as you put forward.

As for the politicians statement, it was not an attack on Cameron. It was a statement about the vast majority of politicians. It was a statement about the lack of honesty, the lack of integrity and the fact that our political system is far too open to abuse by the people in charge of stopping the abuse.  As far as I’m concerned, at least Cameron believes in what he says and what he is doing, and is honest about it. It’s Clegg I detest.

I also agree on the statement that there is difference between caring and being overly supportive and I will happily say that the latter is wasteful and damaging. However, I can say this as someone who is autistic, and is currently studying a Law degree after dealing with a tonne of condescending rubbish from people being “overly supportive”. What knowledge and experience do you have in that area?

P.S. the spelling issues are mainly due to RSI coupled with using a browser without a spellchecking feature. Nothing to do with autism or Downs.

If you really want to spend a little bit of money then donate the cost of the song to the HFSG or HJC. The families will be taking legal action over the coming months and may need financial support. I'm an Apple fan but I would prefer my 79p to go towards the fight for justice than their profit margin. 

To the OP:- This is a noble and heartwarming post and I'm sure everyone appreciates the sentiment. It would be awesome to see YNWA in the charts once again. Gerry and the Pacemakers are still involved with the club so who knows if we might see a charity single for the HFSG in the future!

true,erisacrat,river,River,"Secrets, your subconscious drives, and hidden agendas are found in the 12th house, the house of ""secrets and undoing"". For the Doctor his 12th house cusp is Taurus. This might denote a person who's longing to discover literally who he is. His ascendent makes him want to communicate to anyone and everything, because deep down in his subconscious he's still trying to figure out his worth, where he fits in to the world, or in his case, the universe. Taurus is a very tactile sign and he dreams of using his whole being just to figure this out. There are no planets there so we can't really see what his dirty laundry may be, but Taurus, an ""earth"" sign, is there. I call Taurus Ferdinand the Bull- The sweet little bull that would rather sit under the tree and smell the flowers then fight like the other bulls. Taurus's have a great love for the earth and wants to experience it with their whole being. I don't think this is much of a secret for the Doctor. We know he loves the earth and it's people, but what if his secret has to do with the earth itself?

I have often wondered if the Doctor was the creator of life as we know it on the earth. According to the Cartmel Plan, he may be more than he seems, very possibly the Other, one of the 3 founders of Time Lord Society. Pair his possible big cahuna-ness with his 4th incarnation sticking his fingers in our Primordial ooze in the episode City of Death, and it almost puts him into Creater status. If that's where the writers decided to go, there's a good argument for it. One thing is for sure, according to the ""undoings"" part of the 12th, if you run away from the subconscious urges and secrets of the 12th, it can cause your downfall. Will the love of the earth and it's people be the end of him? Or maybe he deep down, wants to be like us. Time and time again he puts himself in danger to save us and will sacrifice a lot to do so.

There's a lot more that you can delve into in his chart that brings up his secret self. One is the sign of Scorpio which is the 6th house cusp and the Planet of Neptune which is found in his 6th house. There are also a TON of other planets found in his 6th house which means that this house is a big deal in his development,  and funny enough, the 6th house rules literally, doctors. To support that, Pluto which also covers secrets, usually at a karmic, or dare we say it regenerative, level is in a very supportive sextile with Neptune and is found in Virgo which is the sign that rules doctors. This made me giggle.

However, somewhere there is a BBC blog post from when they started introducing the test card on the HD channel. It states that the test card they broadcast is ""consumerised"" - one of the things is something like that the colour saturation is much lower than on a traditional test card.

Really only for consumers to set up their AV equipment instead of for broadcast purposes. It does go into some detail on how to use it which is unusually decent of today's non-technical BBC.

(and if the plans go ahead to turn BBC HD into BBC Two HD, I wonder if they'll try to keep the test card at night or broadcast it as a programme every so often so people can record it?

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Most Time Lords did not travel as the Doctor does. They were largely a xenophobic race with a non-interference policy. They observed other species and events, and sometimes conducted directed missions.  It was the unusual or renegade Time Lords who the Doctor meets in his travels. Often, the High Council would ask the Doctor to do their ""dirty work"" for them because of his abilities to interact with others successfully. There were very few Time Lords that he interacted with away from Gallifrey, or other Time Lord bases (like the one in the ""Trial of a Time Lord"" series).

In trying to remember the actual traveling Time Lords the Doctor meets or are directly mentioned in both classic and new Who, I come up with the following list:

The Master
The Rani
The Corsair
The Monk
Romanna
Draxx
Omega

And that's all I can come up with, maybe others can add to the list?

It is also implied that in the Time War, that the Time Lords put out a call to all their own kind to return to defend Gallifrey. The Doctor did so, even the Master was involved. So, in my understanding, the final battles occurred there. When the Doctor used the Moment to end the war, and the time lock was created, it sealed off not only Gallifrey in the present, but in all points of its past. Everything related to it is inaccessible by time travel.

There could still be Time Lords scattered or in hiding as the Master was at the end of time. Ones like him who fled the final battles, or ignored the call to defend Gallifrey in the first place. I suspect the Rani might be one of those, she's not the team player type, and was exiled by the Time Lords.

Will the Doctor encounter some of these in his further adventures? I guess we will have to wait and see.

He pointed out that Henry basically basically flips professional sports teams for a living(like you stated OP), buying low and then selling high. I know he's done it before, with the Florida Marlins most notably, but I always figured he would flip Liverpool and stay with the Red Sox.

Liverpool certainly has a higher ceiling value wise and if they can get 2.5 billion for the Sox(they have their own Network adding to the value) it would be a good deal. The Red Sox have most likely reached their peak value as well, so it certainly like seems if FSG are going to sell a franchise, it will most likely be the Sox. Liverpool also has a lot more room to grow commercially if FSG can get us to become competitive again. It's just that I always thought the Red Sox be FSG's main money maker and they would branch out from there, flipping smaller franchises. 

I have some mixed emotions on this, being a Sox fan as well. It would be bitter sweet for me if FSG sold the Sox, they brought us our first World Series in 86 years and another 3 years later, but they turned us from the lovable loser everyone adored(well not everyone haha) into a commercialized money making machine. I assume that this is their plan for Liverpool one day as well, buy in low and sell high. I just hope that they will be able to find some sort of middle ground for the commercialism with Liverpool though, but success usually brings plastic/bandwagon fans. In my ideal world, FSG would bring a Borussia Dortmund type of success to Liverpool, but we'll just have to wait and see I guess.

Thank god we didn't end up with the McCourts.

I'm not really sure if LFC have a higher value.

true,TheWinslow,null,null,"Interesting read. The comparison between the writing for RTD and Moffat though doesn't hold up though. Rose was a teenager who fell in love with the doctor and was hardly her equal. She followed him for years, searching only for the Doctors approval (and damn whatever Mickey and her mother had to say about it). She has a tantrum when the Doctor attempts to save her life (and Mickey and her mother are the ones who help her return to save the Doctor). Hell, she freaks out when he regenerates and is lying (unresponsive with something obviously wrong with him) in bed because her Doctor would never have done that. Also, Rose almost dies trying to save the Doctor multiple times (yet there is something wrong with River doing a similar thing).

I have to admit, I really disliked Rose as I found her selfish and boring. I know this isn't the most popular view to have though... 

Martha was better, however the story of unrequited love got old quickly and was really the only personality trait I remembered from her. She spent the entire season gazing at the doctor, hoping he would notice her.

Donna was awesome, yet RTD managed to weaken her character at the end, making her into an insecure woman shouting at the world because she believes she is insignificant. You can't have a snarky and sassy woman who is actually confident, can you?

The assertion that there are no consequences for the Doctor is also incorrect. Take a look at ""Amy's Choice"" with the Dream Lord, the end of season 6 and the christmas special The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe (for clear examples of this, there are other moments scattered through episodes). The Doctor starts commenting on how old he has become in season 6. The christmas special is especially telling, as he talks about how he can no longer feel emotions as strongly because of his age and what he has seen. The episode ends with him crying tears of joy and looking amazed that he is still able to do so.

I'm playing devils advocate; the point of this was to show the bias in the article. The author has deconstructed the overall story to basic statements that prove their point, and their same tactics can be applied to RTD's writing. The comparisons are also difficult, as River is comparable to Captain Jack or Mickey (a character that is important, but appears sporadically), with the added problem of meeting her out of order (so how she views the Doctor changes a huge amount based on the exposure she has had to him). Additionally, RTD had four seasons to develop the Doctor, with Tennant's Doctor really only changing significantly when Rose leaves (he pines after her for the next couple seasons after all) and after Donna leaves (and he is alone and goes all egomaniacal all of the sudden).

I also have a theory that Amy is going to die this season, making the closing paragraphs of the article null. We shall see.",0,1347603849,null,0,1347604639,0,c67zhmu,t3_zuxlt,t1_c67zhmu,t3_zuxlt,null,1429895799,28,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,28

Downs syndrome and learning difficulties have no place on the DNR form as they should not in themselves be a reason for the decision, being bed bound and tube fed are very justifiable reasons for a DNR.

DNRs are a very emotive subject and they were best explained to me as follows. Imagine you are in hospital and that you are receiving treatment for whatever problem you have. Despite all this medical treatment you deteriorate and your heart or breathing stop, at this point CPR could take place. What CPR won't do is fix the problems that led to you having the cardiac arrest in the first place, so even if they do manage to get the heart or breathing going again, they now have to contend with the damage done by not having any oxygen to the organs (kidney, liver and brain) PLUS the underlying condition that caused you to arrest in the first place. All of this means usually a trip to the ICU. Now if you aren't in great shape to start with (bed bound, tube fed) the chances of you making it out of ICU are minimal and on ICU it isn't going to be possible to fix some of the the underlying problems i.e. if you have cancer you aren't going to get chemotherapy on an ICU as it would be too dangerous.

So who should make DNR decisions, people who are trained to weigh up the risk and benefits of an intervention, or people who have an unrealistic expectation of outcome? 

Should I be able to force a surgeon to perform a heart/lung transplant on my bed bound demented granny against the surgeons wishes if he thinks it is a futile operation, because I as the relative think that is what Granny would have wanted? Similarly should I be able to force doctors to perform CPR when they think that it is a futile intervention, where the risks outweigh the benefit?

i dont pretend to know how the timelock works but i always imagined it worked like this:

let's say hypothetically the earth is involved in the timewar and it happens in 1957. now the doctor can travel to earth before 1957 and after 1957 but the timelock will prevent him from visiting 1957 during the timewar. meanwhile, in 1957 you have timelords but they cannot leave 1957 and are stuck in it forever. now change the earth to the entire universe and 1957 to countless other years in both the past and the future and you have the timewar and timelords everywhere, all the time but the doctor and the tardis cannot exist with them at the same time because the timelock prevents it. i've always assumed the the timelock was something the doctor did to the time vortex itself, since it's the only way that it makes sense for it to be inaccessible.

I'm trying to think of a way for you to be more crass... I just... can't. 

That aside... speaking of being naive, who are we kidding here? Go to any beach resort on the Med and have a stroll along the beach. Look at all those bare chested women. Going topless is nothing unusual by a long stretch - the only reason it's sensationalized is because the person involved is royalty. 

Call me a traditionalist but if they really were in a private house and not a public space, I wouldn't blame them (or anyone) for having negative feelings about this. Again, the only thing that makes them worthy of this attention is their status in society. 

Imagine if you wandered around a warm British summer town and sought out girls sunning themselves on their own balconies - then sat outside taking pictures. You'd have the police called on you in no time at all and the local media would brand you a creep and a perv. 

It's a brilliant double standard that it's fine to take shots of one person but not of another. Have we forgotten that behind her status she's still a person with feelings and thoughts of her own? 

But who cares, because she's a hot celeb, right? 

And before anyone figures I'm just a hopeless royalist, I'll chuck some perspective in. I'm a hobbyist photographer who enjoys taking photos of people and places. But I'm still genuine enough to realize how important privacy is.

I prefer the Guardian version of this, since it makes a couple of *very* relevant points.

&gt;The maximum £72,000 compensation cap for unfair dismissal is to be slashed as part of a package of measures designed to remove disincentives from employers to take on new staff. The new cap may be set at the employee's annual salary, or another lower figure.

&gt;Vince Cable, the business secretary,** thinks the current maximum – though awarded in only 1% or 2% of cases a year** – deters employers from hiring staff. **The current median award is only £5,000 to £6,000, with *just 6% of cases leading to awards over £30,000.* **

So before we get any further, lets analyse these figures. 5 or 6k is the Median value, which means that it sits directly in the middle of money typically awarded per year, which means (and the 6% of cases over £30k proves) that the vast majority of awarded compensation is - to put it simply - fucking peanuts.

Lets continue.

I know I sound like a broken record, bringing the same post up whenever an article like this comes up, but fuck it - We dont NEED this shit because we are already one of the most liberal labour markets in europe and indeed the world:

From http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-case-dismissed-on-employment-law-reform/8360 

&gt;OECD indicators of employment protection from 2008 show that the UK has the third least-regulated labour market of all 30 member states surveyed, including most of the world’s leading economies.

http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3746,en_2649_37457_42695243_1_1_1_37457,00.html

&gt;Only in America and Canada do employers enjoy a lighter regulatory burden, according to 21 measures of how easy and expensive it is for companies to lay off their staff.

&gt; The European Trade Union Institute says only 33 per cent of the UK workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements – deals that allow groups like unions to negotiate en masse on wages and working conditions. That’s half the EU average and the smallest percentage in Western Europe.

http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Across-Europe/Collective-Bargaining2

&gt;The Federation of European Employers, which gives its members detailed information about employment regulations across Europe, concludes: “By continental standards, the UK operates a highly liberal labour market with the minimum of legislative intervention and administrative ‘red tape’.”

http://www.fedee.com/natlaw.html[4]

So it would appear that UK businesses are already enjoying a competitive advantage over their European rivals, but that isn’t translating into better growth rates and higher employment.

Plus were the seventh easiest nation in the world to do business in:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_doing_business_index#Ranking

Lets not forget that up to two years in, you can be fired for anything your employer can dream up and they dont have to even fucking tell you why. Most jobs these days have an immediate ""probationary period"" where your employer can simply say ""Get out"" if they want, and thats your job over - they dont need to give it to you in writing.

[And as from April this year, you need to have been working for two years for an employer to be able to take them to a tribunal for unfair dismissal.](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/work_e/work_rights_at_work_e/basic_rights_at_work.htm) (Ctrl+F ""Claim unfair dismissal"").

The Right who are intent on bleating ""Britain is too punitive to business!"" dearly and sincerely need to shut the cunting fuck up because they are *wrong*. Categorically, factually, demonstrably *wrong*. If you cant find out that an employee is terrible within two goddamn years you need to get your head checked.

Vince, I thought, was one of the few good Lib Dems but with this he has finally hung himself. 

We *dont need* to remove worker protections in this country because frankly we havent got any. The only reason that ""business"" wants this removed is to behave fucking terribly to their employees and escape any kind of significant recompense.

EDIT: 

I forgot that people will now also have to fucking pay £1250 to bring an unfair dismissal claim:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/oct/03/employees-pay-unfair-dismissal-claims

Let me reiterate this: YOU HAVE TO PAY £1250 TO GET (on average, *IF* successful) £9,000.

And you also have an issue of people moving from one company to another - ""Ive been with my firm for six years. I would have to work for two years for you to enjoy the same protections but I dont have any guarantee. To cover me against you firing me, I think I should get some ""danger pay"" so lets say £Xk +20%.""

You can see this by just visiting the north and the south, the north has far more towns with huge Victorian buildings and even today the biggest towns and cities are still in the north and Midlands. For example look at Buxton (not strictly ""the north"", but it's a fair way up the country), a small town in the middle of nowhere but it has some huge buildings like the Buxton Crescent, the Devonshire Dome or the Opera House. Same with Matlock, it's baths, or Chesterfield and it's town hall (designed by [John Carr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carr_(architect), just look at his career to see where the wealth used to be). Compare the buildings to places like Reading, Southampton or Winchester. Today the south is largely made up of small towns and villages, but loads of them packed closely together, where as the north has much more space between things.

Pretty much the entirety of the UK's industry used to be in the north along with all the wealth. And it wasn't until industry began to leave the UK for overseas that the South began to shine. And it did so because there was less there (meaning it was easier to do new things) and the London overspill projects brought wealth and development. So when the UK industry died (mainly due to it's own faults), the north fell apart while the south went from strength to strength.

But for some reason, a significant proportion of the population are interested, so will buy this magazine. Knowing that, the publishers feel it's worth publishing them, and paying the photographers a hefty fee for them. So the photographers know that, and are happy to spend a fortune on huge lenses and boats to sit out in the Med for a week at a time.

We can stop this very easily: become completely indifferent to the photos themselves, and perhaps mildly sarcastic about the idiots who are so interested in them. If everybody who bought this kind of shit stopped buying it and started buying something with a bit more gravitas and taste, you'd see behaviours in the media change very quickly.

But that won't happen.

As for the Royal angle: they're public servants. They get to live *very* comfortable lives, and at the expense of the British tax payer. The deal is simple:

We could easily get rid of them as they serve no constitutional or political necessity within public life, but we know foreigners really like them and therefore have a lot of potential to help us with exports, tourism and patronage of important charities (Diana did a lot of work around charities working with HIV and land-mine victims, for example). The royals cost each Brit £0.50 per year out of taxes, and perhaps bring in several hundred pounds per capita in tourism, exports, etc.

All that is expected from most Brits is: Don't fuck that up. Don't embarrass us. Realise you're doing a job almost 24x7 where you get the nicest things in life that most of us will never have access to, but in return you can't make us look stupid. Do that job well, and no problem. Do it badly, and we'll be a bit pissed off.

Hence the reaction to Harry. He has a mild get out of jail card though: he was born into it, and didn't ask to join ""the club"" unlike Diana, Fergie and Kate; and, frankly, the public cut him a lot of slack because every time we get angry with him we all have the gut reaction of remembering him behind his mother's coffin in 1997 and thinking ""fuck, the lad has had a hard life emotionally-speaking"".

On this one though, the press have misjudged it. We're mostly indifferent to it. Nudity on its own is just normal. It's not the same as nudity in Las Vegas, drunk, playing billiards, with orgy under-tones implicit in the context.

Another reason London currently benefits is it was well placed to benefit from the decision to abandon manufacturing and move towards financial services. It already had all the infrastructure and corporate networks in place to instantly be the go to place once those changes were made.

Finally it gets more general tax spent on it per person by a long way*. In part taxation is supposed to balance out uneven economic activity but in the UK we do it the other way around. London gets the most tax per person and that drives the economy there further.

UK policy has been London first for decades. The odd 1/2% either way on taxation is bread crumbs compared to the vast benefits London currently gets from UK policy.

He was more focused on saving the world, which is completely valid.

I have to say one of the advantages of what I do (engineering) is that I can keep informed as to what's going on: manufacturing does still happen here, but it's of an entirely different nature (and less focused around big products, big factories, big work forces).

Economically it's a coup, and if you work in the technical aspects, it's better than ever. We are however left with a nation where there is a legacy of mass industry, with no replacement for the scale of employment that went hand-in-hand with that.

To me, the dwindling of large factories, shipyards etc, is not so sad (well it is, but these things do come and go over time).

Their budget for accommodation is 2,000 USD a month. That gets you quite a nice place in downtown Beijing.

If I'm remembering correctly they get a yearly travel allowance of the equivalent of 5 business class flights back to the UK. Though they can choose to spend it how they like on flights; doesn't have to be business class and doesn't have to be spent to go to or from the UK. 

There are a whole load of other benefits they get for serving overseas, but I can't really remember them all. Having been in a car with them it seems that you don't have to obey local traffic laws at all, the benefits of diplomatic plates. Though admittedly in China no one really obeys the local traffic laws.

I remember going for a dinner with them and a load of their colleagues on one of my trips to Beijing and the topic turned to the Bubbly Brunches (3-4 hours of amazing food and free flow champagne for about 50quid a head) held at the local 5 star hotels. The preferred places to go seemed to come down to the champagne of preference of the person. My friends like the Westin because they served Verve.

Subs: Diakité, Derry, Cisse, Mbia, Ferdinand, Faurlin, Green

*That was tough. We have so much depth in mid-field, it's very difficult to choose a definite starting line-up.*

*I also had to spend some time choosing the defense. We have a lack of left-footed defenders and I think we have stronger centre-backs than Ferdinand to start, plus we now have Mbia, surely one of the best full-backs in the PL.*

*Both Traoré and Fabio are naturally attacking-minded, so no matter how you line the team up we are likely to be pushing forward. I put Park in a defensive mid-field position to try and maintain a connection between the mid-field and the back four - in reality it'll be mostly a remaining back 2 (Bosingwa &amp; Nelson) for most of the game, though even Nelson seems to go forward. Park's workman-like performances will be needed with 90% of the team in the other half for most of the game.*

In Amy's choice, the Dream Lord is the personification of the Doctor's inner critic. He is extremely self-critical (the only one person in the universe could hate the Doctor that much is the Doctor). There aren't any physical consequences for the Doctor, but after that episode I have always seen the Doctor's ""carefree"" attitude as somewhat of a sham. He acts as if nothing ever phases him, but the entire time he is brutally critiquing every action he makes (even the insignificant ones like his choice of style).

In the christmas special, he saves a life, but that isn't the consequence I was referring to. The main point of the episode is to contrast the Doctor and the family; the family getting the father back is secondary (plus the Doctor wasn't responsible for saving him). The main point is that he is old and unable to deeply feel emotions anymore (the consequence for hundreds of years of life). He can't cry tears of joy for instance. That is why the end is so important, he cries tears of joy when visiting the Ponds for Christmas dinner, something he believed he would never be able to do. It shows how important the Ponds are to him. His inability to show emotion also indicates just how jaded he had become (maybe I am reading into this, but I thought of it as something like burnout for EMTs, or the fact that soldiers in WWII would refuse to befriend the new recruits because they were likely to die).

true,Sjreed,null,null,"It may seem ridiculous to you, but this is definatley welcome for small business owners like my brother and his flatmate, who I was discussing this issue with recently. They set up a small recruitment agency about 8 months ago which is profitable and are looking to expand soon, having saved a buffer of around 50k, easily enough for a full years wages for a new employee, but if after a year the new employee had to be let go and claimed unfair dismissal it would kill the company, as they would need to spend their time which would be their only source of income for the company dealing with it and large amounts of money on legal fee's. 

Like most small business's they want long term employee's and would much rather not have to fire people, but something as simple as being able to make the threat of taking a firing to a tribunal is pretty scary stuff and would probably lead to them just giving them an out of court settlement so they could move on, regardless of the situation, as the alternative would be worse. This is an unfair balance of power towards the employee, they can effectivley hold a small company to ransom.

The reason this topic came up was due the same thing happening to a friend of his who set up a digital marketing agency, had a member of staff who was great but then starting going through an emotional rough patch which heavily affected the company and lost them a lot key clients and put the business at risk and when they asked him to leave he threatened unfair dismissal and discrimination, the company ended up paying him an out of court settlement as it would have ruined them to go through the whole process of going to court at a time they had already lost key clients and were desperatly trying to repair their reputation whilst needing to do the work with one less person.

Edit: I'll reproduce here:

&gt;When I set out to write this article, I wanted to review John Obi Mikel’s performances for Chelsea so far this season, mostly due to how he has impressed me personally but also because he quite often comes under criticism which we will discuss later and eventually try and disprove.
&gt;
&gt;The Nigerian has played well enough, perhaps to convince Di Matteo and the board that letting Raul Meireles and Michael Essien (albeit on loan) to leave is good business in reducing the wage bill and net expenditure, whilst not hurting the strength of the squad to compete for the 5 remaining trophies this season.
&gt;
&gt;Mikel and Romeu are now the only real defensive minded midfielders available in the senior squad, as Lampard still has an attacking mentality and Ramires is the box to box engine. The Likes of Chalobah can do the job very well at a level but is untested and unproven in the premier league level and is out on loan along with around 25 others to gain competitive experience anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Mikel is often seen as a player who completes a lot passes by simply playing the ball back to Terry and his defensive partner (Cahill, Luiz or Ivanovic) creating an artificially high pass completion in an area of the pitch that normally provides time and space to make simple backwards passes.
&gt;
&gt;It appears to be a common belief that this play slows the game down and stops Chelsea from building a quick counter attack or suggests the team is lacking the urgency demanded by some supporters, perhaps gets caught in possession too often and as whole can be unreliable or frustrating for Chelsea fans.
&gt;
&gt;But the statistics tell another story.
&gt;
**Mikel vs Wigan**
&gt;
&gt;An opening exhibition from Hazard helped the blues to a 7th minute 2 goal cushion before hitting cruise control for the rest of the game. Mikel had a solid display completing 49 of his 52 attempted passes, receiving the ball 39 times, 19 of his 21 passes were forward, 17 of 17 backward and 13/14 sideways.
&gt;
&gt;**Mikel vs Reading**
&gt;
&gt;A dominant first 25 from Chelsea with some exciting tiki-taka football and a goal was blown away by an unstoppable header and a mistake by Cech. The Blues rallied in the second half to win 4-2 and Mikel was replaced by Oscar in an almost gung-ho attitude by Di Matteo to salvage the points and the 100% start to the season.
&gt;
&gt;The Nigerian completed 63 of 70 attempted passes, received the ball 57 times. Completed 10 of 13 attempted passes in the final third. 32 of his 39 forward passes were accurate compared to 15/15 backwards and 16/16 square.
&gt;Mikel vs Newcastle
&gt;
&gt;**Mikel vs Newcastle**
&gt;
&gt;Partnering Meireles in a more defensive minded double pivot against a side that beat Chelsea 0-2 at the Bridge towards the end of last season and a side that also finished higher in the league. It was an understandable tactical change by Di Matteo and the statistics show a share in the defensive qualities needed from a midfield to keep Chelsea’s 2nd clean sheet in three games.
&gt;
&gt;The Nigerian completed 60 of his 63 attempted passes and received the ball 53 times. Although clearly not thought of as an attacking player, Mikel completed 5 of 6 attempted passes in the final third.
&gt;
&gt;58 of 61 short passes were completed and 26 of 29 were passed forwards as opposed to just 14 of 14 backwards and 20/20 side to side (square).
&gt;
&gt;Mikel made 11 passes to Meireles his team-mate in the double pivot or central midfield role, unsurprisingly. However Mikel made 8 passes to Hazard and 5 to Torres which is 13 combined and more than Mikel’s total passes to defenders Luiz, Ivanovic and Cech combined.
&gt;
&gt;Mikel Vs Newcastle The Influence of John Obi Mikel | Stats Analysis
&gt;
&gt;In summary (59%) 96 of 164 passes analysed have gone to ‘forward players’ – those other players playing in the 2-3-1 of a 4-2-3-1 formation.
&gt;
&gt;29% of his passes have gone forward in the first 3 games of the premier league season compared to just 12% going backwards.
&gt;
&gt;Mikel has completed 13 of 18 final third pass&gt;es successfully and  has maintained 93% passing accuracy his own half as well as 93% in the opposition half.
&gt;
&gt;**Mikel Vs Last Season**
&gt;
&gt;Last season Mikel made 22 league starts, completed over 982 passes (90% completion). Made 362 passes forwards compared to just 110 backwards, 295 passes went left and 322 passes to the right.
&gt;
&gt;Mikel was dispossessed just 16 times last season, 0.727 times per game or once every 88 minutes (this season he has improved to once every 124 minutes), whilst recovering possession 184 times making 4 blocks and 33 interceptions.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The Statistics from this season and last show a forward playing and forward thinking Mikel, but a player who also understands the need to keep possession by being able to pass sideways and avoid being dispossessed. At Stamford Bridge this season 29% of Mikel’s passes were forwards against Newcastle and 37% against Reading, 72% of his attacking third passes have been accurate and to compliment that Mikel has won 86% of his tackles, 57% of his ground duels and 33% of his aerial duels.

It was because of a international school that my dyslexia was picked up, as when I was in a state school in the UK they just said I was 'a bit slow and would catch up eventually' and didn't get any help for it. 

Many people are saying that it is elitist, suggesting that all diplomats come from the upper class, well that is not the case with my father.

Because of my dad's work we always got 'hardship' posts, meaning that you are posted to places where there living conditions were difficult. Two presidents were assassinated and martial law was declared when I was 8 years old living in Sri Lanka. Also a number of suicide bombers attack the capital over the years. In Indonesia, the president was deposed and riots broke out and we were evaluated from the country.

Some don't want to go back back there are no jobs there, and very little social welfare. They may have families. While it may be 'unfair' for the taxpayer... can you blame them for fighting to stay somewhere where they are guaranteed food on the table for their children?

Some have been here for years and have been paying their share, but suddenly have found themselves out of work. Can you blame them for feeling they deserve a bit of support from a system they have helped fund?

I was thinking of countering point for point but I'm going to go the shorter route which may come across as selfish but unfortunately that's kind of the point: 

&gt; Some don't want to go back back there are no jobs there, and very little social welfare. They may have families. While it may be 'unfair' for the taxpayer... can you blame them for fighting to stay somewhere where they are guaranteed food on the table for their children?

No, I can't blame them for fighting to stay somewhere where they're given these concessions. It's a good deal for them and if I were in that position, I'd fight for it as well. 

But I'm not. I'm a taxpayer. Not hugely wealthy - but one of many paying to keep the system working. 

Put simply my gripe is this. The boiled down notion of paying taxes in this country is: 

""All of you must put money into a big pot from which we will offer you health care, education for your young and so on and so on"". That's fine. I might be paying for the guy across the road but then he is paying for me. 

But what happens when the pot is made bigger - takes more to fill - and that comes from me. But me and the guy across the road aren't the only ones with our hands in the pot anymore. Now we have to share with folks from the neighboring town who saw what a good deal we had and have come for a piece of the action. We don't think it's fair - but the guy who owns the pot is OK with it and so we have to cope. 

I hope that makes some sense. It's not the most polished analogy ever but it kind of sums up the notion that there is an ""us"" and a ""them"" and that we are paying for *them* - and for what return? Out of the goodness of our hearts? 

These are hard times. I would love to be selfless at all times - but it's a lot easier to do that without worrying about the roof over your head or the food on your own table (which is a squeeze folks are feeling right now).

true,Moleman42,null,null,"I don't really agree. I think making the Doctor (or the repercussions of life with the Doctor) cause of the break up/divorce is a total disservice to Amy and Rorys relationship. I mean, they were in love and due to be married before the Doctor whisked them away? So why would they start to struggle just because the Doctors not around? Sure, their travels have affected and changed them, but changed them together, for the better. Their relationship wasn't founded on action and adventure, so nothing is taken away when that is gone. I think it's nice and important that the Doctor isn't the centre of everything all the time. You know, the Doctor is this amazing fantastic hero to us, but to Amy he's more of a best friend, Rory has been her hero the whole time, and Rory is fantastically devoted to Amy obviously. 

And I think a theme, as we've seen in the Pond Life eps, the ""weaning us off"" comment in Dinosaurs and probably the upcoming Power of Three episode (which looks to take place in Amy and Rorys home), is that the Ponds have a life outside the Doctor and a normal one (real troubles and all) at that. It's for that reason, I think/hope they won't have a tragic ending. 

Also, I thought the little plot point of Amy not being able to have children was a really good way of dealing with the whole River Song conundrum. The second half of season six kinda brushed over the consequences of Amy losing her baby, and this was a good way of showing that yes, that stuff, that trauma did have an effect and no, ""raising"" Melody by growing up with her is completely not the same as raising a child.

true,ksturgis,null,null,"While I appreciate the effort to reproduce the statistical analysis, it still doesn't show much to discredit any doubts on his forward passing abilities. Feel free to correct me if I missed anything, as I skimmed for the important parts while at work. 

For starters, the most redeeming stat is his passing accuracy in the final 3rd thus far this season. While we might applaud these results, were looking at a only 3 games, two of which were against sides that will likely be battling relegation. So while completing 13 out of 18 passes in the final third is respectable, we would really need to see a larger sample size against respectable opposition to be able to draw any sort of reasonable conclusions. This takes us to the analysis of his performances last season

According to the stats posted above, only 33% of Mikel's passes were forward passes. This means 2 out of every 3 passes were lateral or back passes. Which (in my opinion) reiterates my point made about why his overall passing % is high, due to his tendency to play simple safe passes. Another stat that isn't addressed (which I explicitly requested in my original post you so generously revisited) was his passing percentage on passes over 12 yards. I ask bc the vast majority of forward passes that I see mikel play are short 5-6 yard passes right in front of him. So again while he may have a high completion rate on forward passes, it doesnt accurately show his ability to make the incisive passes that can aid an attack. 

So again I stand by my critical summation of Mikel and his inefficiencies, and these one-dimensional statistical analyses only support the argument/opinion of the OP and don't provide any sort of subjective evidence for us to draw reasonable conclusions.

And it's not like the show is only recently cropping up on American televisions, either: Doctor Who was consistently a staple programming package for American PBS stations - which, throughout the '70s and '80s, were often the strongest and clearest broadcast signal for your rabbit ears. If you lived in an area which was even mildly rural, chances are PBS was your go-to TV station - and chances are you would have watched at least one episode of Doctor Who at some point.",0,1347641313,null,0,false,0,c68544k,t3_ztzaf,t1_c68544k,t3_ztzaf,null,1429898590,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,sdtp,cnty-england,Southern Fairy,"No, you're right, I shouldn't have told him fuck you. However it was more his tone that I felt implied that the attack was deserved. It wasn't stated explicitly, and so I guess we can't make any assumptions. This is the intranet. Striked out.

Believe me or don't, I'm not really that fussed. Here's a blow-by-blow account of what happened. It's quite an entertaining story, so I don't mind reciting it even just for one person.

1am, just finished working, put my lights onto my bike, no dice (I thought they'd broken, turns out the batteries had just died). I stuck them in my pocket and decided that, well, I was just going to ride on the pavement tonight. Normally it's completely empty anyway, as all the students who are going out have left, and all the people who aren't are at home. Anyway. I see 3 people walking towards me, so I pull over to the side and slow to a stop to allow them to pass.

I notice that the 3 people are a man and a woman around 55-65 years old and a man around 35 years old (I can only assume it was their son).

As they come level with me, the old man steps in front of me, putting his legs either side of my wheel. I've had people screwing with me before because I'm a cyclist, and I was very tired and just wanted to get home, so I was not in the mood for any shit.

He was clearly drunk, and said, ""Get on the road.""
I just replied, ""Leave it out mate.""

His son and wife (?) were stood just past me on my left and I guess waiting for their man to have his fun.

He said, ""Get on the fucking road!""
I said, ""Fuck off, mate,""
He said, ""It's illegal to ride on the pavement!""
I said, ""Seriously mate, give it a fucking rest will you, I just want to go home,""

He then started getting too close to me, seriously invading my personal space. I was sat on my bike, my arms at my side, in a completely non-threatening way, clearly just exhausted and tired of the situation.

He then shouted, ""I'll call the fucking police!""
To which I replied at an equal volume, ""Go on then! I just rode past some back there!""

At this point he lurched forwards, grabbing me round the throat and bringing his face close to mine, pressing on my adam's apple and growling in my face, ""GET ON THE FUCKING ROAD!""

Before I could even react, his son had put his right forearm around my head from behind, and used his left arm to push his father off me, and then his son came close to my face and told me quite sternly to, ""Fuck off. Now.""

I then proceeded to call the old man a cunt. Which I feel was deserved, irrelevant of what anyone else says.
The old man was shouting at me saying, ""I'll call the fucking police!""
I shouted back saying that I would have him convicted of assault.

I was seriously shaken up; I'm not good with confrontation at the best of times, let alone being assaulted. I've been beaten up a few times but this was the scariest moment.

Anyway, I got back on my bike and rode off, still on the pavement, and saw 2 Policemen walking towards me.

Normally I wouldn't say anything, I'm reasonably anti-Police most of the time (a story for another time), but I thought, ""You know what? This is what the Police are here for. For protection. This guy has just assaulted me and I would like to find him and press charges.""

So I said to the Police, ""Hello, hi, basically, an old man just assaulted me, he tried to strangle me for riding on the pavement. I know, I shouldn't be riding on the pavement; my bike lights have died.""

They said, ""Would you like to find him? Press charges?""

To which I said, ""You know what? Yeah. I would.""

So we walked. For 15 minutes. Down the road. In the attempt to find this old man.

But alas, we didn't. After a while I said, ""Look, I don't think we're going to find him.""

With all due respect to the 2 VERY pleasant policeman, they would probably have followed me around all night, and they did say, ""Are you sure? If you give us a description we'll look out for him, and if you see him don't hesitate to ring us.""

* Tunisia - Zine Ben Ali, military dictator, supported by Western countries, particularly France. For example, French foreign minister offered security service assistance to quell the Tunisian rebellion.

* Yemen - The military dictator, Saleh, recently stepped down, but has been replaced by a similar figure. Supported by America, to facilitate drone strikes against militant targets in the interior of the country.

* Egypt - Government heavily controlled by Britain in the decades following independence, leading to a military coup by Nasser. Britain then conspired with France and Israel to invade the Suez Canal. Following Nasser's death, America supported successive dictators in Sadat and Mubarak. That certainly means tens of billions of dollars of military hardware, and major security service links. For instance, Adam Curtis alleges that the CIA trained Egyptian military interrogators in torture techniques.

* Sudan - Has been the subject of fifty years of civil war between the Christian, animist South, and the Muslim North, after Britain drew up its colonial borders (presumably for the purpose of divide and rule).

Obviously, I disagree with your opinion.  I think the show has increased in maturity and subtlety over the last few years - due to the increase in pace, the dialogue is often very stripped down, but rarely dumbed down.  

For me, where the show has really come along since the changeover is in the relationships between characters - they've stopped flatly saying how they feel about things, and started *showing* it by inferrence instead.  The viewer has to work a little harder, but I feel it is the more rewarding for it.

As for River's character, she has followed the path from iron-ass to clueless noob, and the catchphrases have been used to support and clarify this.  And at least such catchphrases are usually intertwined with deeper meaning, or have interest in themselves.

It is a tough thing to train however, as a lot of it comes down to a persons attitudes and beliefs, as ethics and morals overlap but obviously are different between people. We should try harder.

Both groups having a veto is an interesting idea, I see the appeal of it for sure but a few things strike me as problems.

1) Not every patient will have that other group, which creates an inequality between patients, a minor point perhaps but if you accept some people will have no family to advocate for them in these situations, then you are relying on the judgement of the medics anyway.

2) I don't agree that families are any better placed to make ethical decisions around life or death either, the bottom line is its hard as hell to think about this stuff,  its even harder when its someone you are close to.  

3) Lets say medics want a DNR, family veto it.  What happens if that patient needs CPR, the medics think CPR is the wrong thing to do - which translates as 'this will harm my patient for very little risk, I swore an oath not to do that',  ?  You are then legally forcing people to act against their ethical principles, chiefly do no harm. 


These are all reasons why it is best practice to have discussions wherever possible, but I wouldn't advocate changing the law about it.

*Doctor Who* is a British science-fiction television program that began in 1963. It features the adventures of an alien Time Lord known simply as the Doctor. The Doctor travels through time and space with his companions in an attempt to save civilizations from destruction. He travels in his spaceship. Known as the TARDIS, which stands for Time and Relative Dimension In Space. It is disguised as a blue British police box. Popular in the 1960's. With the power of regeneration, the character of the Doctor is able to be passed along to a new actor as needed. The Doctor has been portrayed by 11 different actors since 1963. The show holds two Guinness World Records: the longest-running science-fiction show in the world and the most successful science-fiction series of all time. *Doctor Who* has spawned multiple spin-offs including *Torchwood* and *The Sarah Jane Adventures*",0,1347650422,null,0,false,0,c687l97,t3_zvxsi,t1_c687l97,t3_zvxsi,null,1429899755,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,Lozzy1256,null,null,"Sorry, I've just realised that everything I've typed is just a 'bleh' of stuff. Hope you can make sense of it all!

Yeh, I once read an article that said it was worth taking the max student loan even if you didn't need it and put it in your ISA for the year. It all made perfect sense to me at the time, and I wish I could find it now!

So totally, get your student loan. It's the best type of debt to be in! University is investing in your future - you need to spend some money on that! The interest rate only goes up by inflation (I believe) so you're only ever paying what you borrowed back, and you only start paying it once you start earning a decent wage. It also all gets written off after a certain amount of time. (Sorry I'm not being more specific, I'm assuming you're in England, and I'm in Scotland so the loans are set up slightly differently, but the principle is the same!)

As for saving money - you need to be writing down all your expenses. Seriously, go buy yourself a wee book, or start a note in your phone, and write down every single penny that you spend. Buy a Fudge bar (can you still buy them?) for 10p? Write it down! Phone contract? Write it down! At the end of the month sit down and look at what you're spending. Sort everything that you've spent into categories! You'll soon start to notice trends. For example - I used to buy a coffee from Starbucks 5 days a week on my way to classes. That was almost £30 a week. I really couldn't justify spending that much money on a cup of coffee everyday, so I bought myself a thermos mug (for £4) and made coffee at home every morning instead! Once you've worked out where you're overspending - stop! If it means only going out with a certain amount of cash on you and no cards then do that. If it means carrying different wallets with money for different things - do it! 

And start up a savings account. http://www.moneysupermarket.com/savings/ has some good comparisons. You're looking for an account that has a good percentage, and has no penalties for withdrawals. Sainsbury's Websaver seems to be a good one at the moment, but thats a special bonus rate for one year, so you might need to open up a new account after one year and close the Sainsbury's one, to keep getting a good rate.

Since you're unlikely to get any 'emergencies' in the time you're at college, you might want to consider starting to throw money at an cash ISA. This is like a savings account, except you can't put any more than £5640 into it per year. Any interest that you earn you don't need to pay tax on. Try to get an 'access ISA', which means that you can get your money out at any time, but you can't replace it in that year (e.g. if the limit is £5000, and you've got £3000 in it, and you withdraw £1000 then your new 'limit' is £4000, and you've now got £2000).

Start to put all this money that you're saving now after your little notebook exercise into your savings account and your ISA. (ISA first, preferably, since it's going to be a better rate and you wont pay tax on interest)

If you've got a phone contract, when it runs out look at getting a giffgaff sim, or if your parents have Virgin internet or phone or telly then you can get a rolling contract sim from them. I've got one and get more than I could ever use in a month for £9/month. I got my sister-in-laws fancy xperia phone that she got on contract, she didn't like it, so kept her contract and her old phone, and I got a shiny new smart phone!

In terms of travel, if you're on DLA then you might be entitled to a bus pass (if you've not got one already?). Make use of it when you can! If you're living in any moderately sized town or a city (which chances are you will be, if you go to uni) then buses are your friend - make use of them! Don't bother learning to drive! Although it might be worth getting your provisional just before you turn 17, since it's always good to have ID that's not your passport. For some reason I'm ok with taking my drivers license everywhere I go but not my passport!

And last but no least - read up about finances. Bursary's are an awesome thing to get while you're in college. It's people offering you free money! If you're entitled to one then you're as well to get it. Even if you don't spend it then you can throw that in your newly acquired savings account/ISA and let it make money for you! You'll need as much of it as you can get when you go to uni, because it's VERY unlikely you'll get your way through uni without taking out a loan.

Also, someone above mentioned student bank accounts. Be very careful about which one you choose. In August/September time all of the banks are looking to give you a student bank account. You're only allowed one, and studies have shown that few people actually shop around for new accounts, so once they've got their claws into you chances are they'll keep you. That means that they're all offering all sorts of fancy incentives for signing up with them. Look for cash bonuses, or things like 5 years of 18 - 25 rail card if you do a lot of traveling. 

When you do get to uni, sign up for all the free things you can get. Someone gives you an lidl bag with a few cans of soup in it? Awesome! I hate tomato soup, but that stuff went in the cupboard, and when I had a fiver to live off and a week until my loan came through, it tasted like God sent it from heaven! Someone offers you free membership to the film and pizza society which costs £10 to join for the year and you meet twice a month to eat pizza and watch films for free? Great go for it!

Hope all this made sense! If you've got any questions feel free to ask, or if someone can be more specific about loans in England then please do chip in!",0,1347651903,null,0,false,0,c687zzr,t3_zvz6q,t1_c687zzr,t3_zvz6q,null,1429899947,3,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,3

Pretty impressive display.

Ngoo has some awkwardly efficient footwork and body positioning.  Was a big threat for his short time on the pitch.

Adorjan (sp?) was very Ozil in his movement, fantastic hit for his goal.

Morgan was ever the runner and did provide some threatening runs, but also mishit frequently.

Yes of course! Fuck me, I want our embassies to protect themselves so I must hate all non-whites! How fucking obvious!

&gt;I tagged you as wanting genocide a while ago, some thing related to Afghanistan or Iraq.

Righty!

&gt;You haven't changed as far as I can tell.

You'd have to have an accurate picture of who I am to know that, and since you clearly have a very hilariously distorted view of who I am, you will probably never manage to tell.

&gt;You chose to obsess around this decade thing

I never obsessed over it, you said something false, I corrected it, and you got your back up against the wall immediately.

&gt;which conveniently allows you to avoid the fact that islamic extremism has been for a few generations indirectly and directly cultivated through ""collateral"" damage, occupation, and even conspiracies.

Whut? Why would I need to avoid that? I made no argument related to that, I defended no position which runs contrary to that, and in fact I'm quite aware of the various clusterfucks we've caused in the middle east for about the last 100-120 years and quite happy to discuss them. Yet you assumed that because I said you were incorrect about one thing and asked for evidence about another that I must have some big agenda in proving everything you said wrong because I'm some nutter who wants to glass the middle east.

As I said, you're very tiring because you jump to conclusions better than a fucking adolescent frog.

&gt;We funded Saddam, we funded the Mujahideen, supported extremists in Libya, and even to this day the UK is funding extremism in Syria.

Some of these things I know to be true, some I don't know to be true, some I doubt, but so what? What does that have to do with my original post? **Nothing**

Christ, you lot are so fucking fragile that if anyone dares to avoid the circlejerk and just flat out corrects you, or dares to ask you to provide evidence, there's not a milimetre of space between you and the highest wall you can find, and you assume that you've become embroiled in some adversarial fight against neo-Hitler.

true,TheLushCompanion,mcgann,McGann,"Sally and Reinette are pretty complex for non-recurrent characters. The contrast between River Song and Reinette is very interesting to me. River Song is supposed to be the Doctor's equal, right? She's a Time Lady substitute, due to her unique conception. But Moffat doesn't show us one single thing in her entire arc that suggests she has anything like a Time Lord's mental abilities. The Wedding of River Song shows that she neither senses nor really cares about the Web of Time. We've never seen her initiate telepathy. Nothing. The only ""more than human"" things about her are her ability to regenerate and her strength. Reinette, in her one single episode shows that she can surprise the Doctor by sensing his thoughts through their mental link. I think you're right on about the focus being the source of the problem. My contention is that Moffat's strength is as a writer, not as a show runner. He's running two successful shows concurrently as well as writing stories.

I don't think she's supposed to be a Time Lord though.  She's a human that was born in the vortex so she could be manipulated into having those problems.  Not to mention she didn't have the social upbringing as a Time Lord to back up feelings about the web of time.  Not to mention, she's supposed to foil the Doctor.  Her interest in the story comes from her desire to move quickly to action, to question the Doctor, and rile him up.  If she was too ""Time Lord"", she would get too similar to him.

Not to mention, as many have said, River at the time of The Wedding of River Song was young.  She cared more about showing the Doctor that he was a good man and was loved than keeping the web of time in place (Speaking of like... it's okay when Rose and Rory ignore the laws of time for their loved ones but when River does it she's a dumb bitch?  LOL kay fandom).  The idea was that sometimes love is more important that following the rules.

Repeating lines is something Moffat has always been fond of, formerly to the point where they would become painful.  If anything he has *decreased* the use of the most egregious ones, or pointedly reused them in new ways, often quite cleverly.

true,disguisedmuel,null,null,"Before I begin, I want to qualify my advice. I'm a student of two years, about to go into my third. I've applied twice, switched course twice, and completed two first years. I've lived on campus and rented privately. I've had a grant and not had a grant, and in those respective years, I've had a financial surplus and have been forced to ask my parents for help. In other words, I've got a lot of university experience under my belt, and a lot more to come.

&gt; My college offers something called a ""bursary fund"" which is basically another benefit, but I'd rather not rely on benefits

Benefits aren't evil you know, and neither are the people who rely on them. They're there to help people like you to succeed. Accept the help -- you're going to need it. If you like, you can rationalise it by making a commitment to pay back into a scholarship/bursary fund once you're successful.

&gt; I know I can get a loan to pay for university, but I'm well aware that loans are a great way to put myself in a massive hole for the rest of my life, so fuck that, it's a last resort.

Provided that you do a good degree at a good university, the debt is well worth it. I hate that education is now touted as ""investment in your future"", but it's a good investment to make, even with the higher fees. Others have elaborated why the loans are so good, so I won't go into detail.

&gt; How do I save as much money as possible?

Set up a savings account and direct every penny you can in it. Get one with the highest interest you can -- it won't be very high but a few extra pennies every few months can't hurt. ISA would not be a good idea at this point as you could need to get to your money at a moment's notice, but an ISA would lock it away.

&gt; How can I go to uni without also going to massive debt?

Unless you have rich family prepared to support you, it is impossible. I'm sorry, I wish it were different. However, provided that your parents' household income is low enough you can also get a non-repayable grant paid to you directly. (You could arrange with your university to use this to pay some of your fees, but it would be a drop in the ocean and it would be much better spent on your living costs.)

As long as all the forms are sent off in time, tuition fees won't be a problem. The main problem you wil face during your degree will be living costs. As you rightly point out, many students get help from their parents. This is because you cannot live off student finance, even, in some cases, with a grant. You will need to be frugal, smart and get your hands on every bursary and scholarship you can.

On the subject of bursaries and scholarships, some courses at some universities will give you an automatic scholarship just for taking up the place, or for fulfilling some criteria like being female or coming from a certain background. Look out for these, but *always* go for the quality of the institution and the degree above money. There's no point getting a shit degree from a shit university, even if they do give you £500 a year. It won't be worth it in the long run.

Do everything you can to avoid getting a job that interferes with your studies. If you do a science degree, getting a job during term will interfere with your studies (there's simply too much contact time). You may be able to get a summer job with your department or at a research institution, specifically aimed at undergraduates, so look for those.

&gt; How many ways can I save money?

There is only one way to save money: have it, then don't spend it.

&gt; How do I be as cheap as humanly possible without feeling like this?

Budget (I find it particularly helpful to have a weekly budget I'm not allowed to exceed). Figure out the essentials and cut back the extras. Invest in quality items infrequently. Make your own food wherever possible. Go drinking only occasionally. Do it right, and you'll end up with money left over at the end of each term.

What can you do while in college? Save what you can but it won't be enough to live off when you go to uni. It will help, but most of your income will come directly from student loans/grants.

**The most important thing you can do right now is to get the best results you can in your A Levels**. Don't get a job in college if you can at all help it; put all your energies into getting the best grades you can. A's, preferably. Be in a position where you can apply to the best universities in the country for your chosen course, and be confident of getting a place.

One last thing. Please, please go to university to, first and foremost, study. Partying and a good job afterwards are bonuses. Choose a subject that you love, because you will commit to it and reap the rewards -- financial and otherwise -- as a result.",0,1347656604,null,0,false,0,c6898x5,t3_zvz6q,t1_c6898x5,t3_zvz6q,null,1429900536,4,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,4

Ngoo was showing support the families of the 96 and the fight for justice. This is quite clearly one of the times for sensibility to be used.

Further, he becomes a ""monster"" blending with Rose's DNA. Smith's Daleks are Dalek's trying to bring the entire species back, by pretending to be slaves to the humans.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"Consider the Duggan event last year, who could have predicted the animosity towards police that broke out? The film itself is obvious muslim baiting, and being published on youtube in July, having been made 12 months previously, why now is a great question. [Some are suggesting it was an organised revenge assassination attack](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4280821,00.html). Who even came up with the narrative that this was about the film? What is the evidence?

I don't really see it as an explosion though. It's not really that significant in terms of violence, but it's a big deal because of the target and made a big deal by the press and military because that's what they do. Some reported that dead bodies were dragged through the streets to add more humiliation, but [actually they were dragged away from the fire and then to a hospital where the ambassador died of smoke inhalation](http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/09/how-sam-bacile-bamboozled-the-ap-wall-street-journal-over-anti-muslim-film258.html). The ""enemy"" must be made to look as bad as possible to legitimise any force against them, or legitimise the expansion of empire. More people including nine children were killed by that [""one"" rogue US soldier terrorist](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/19/afghanistan-american-imperialism-glenn-greenwald?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter) for example, a death toll far higher than all these embassy ""riots"" as so far as I can make out.

It's almost impossible to pick this apart, but it is clear that the most significant uprisings have been around the middle eastern countries that have seen US/NATO aggression in recent times. Far eastern islamic states, or even middle eastern ""friendly"" islamic states like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain haven't made the headlines. The old wisdom is to ask who benefits? But it's unclear because there are so many players.

**""Common"" muslims** - they rarely benefit from violence, however there has been so much directed at them for many years now it is understandable that they would be resentful. It could be spontaneous insurrections or deliberately herded and directed by others.

&gt; [Predators launched 145 strikes on ex-regime targets. That was twice the barrage drones unleashed in all of 2011 on tribal Pakistan, the place commonly thought of as the epicenter of U.S. drone strikes.](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/332810)

If people hate the film so much why haven't they gone after israeli embassies especially since Sam Bacile was on record as 

**""Extreme"" muslims** - the most extreme muslims in Libya were the same ones that the west supported, so why should we be surprised when violence reoccurs? These people might use this as an excuse to further the ""brotherhood"" and gain political power, but it would seem odd to bite the hand that was feeding just a few months earlier. Have we seen this before? Western militaries know exactly what happens when you back extremists, Afghanistan is the example. You fracture a country, the same is happening in Syria.

**US military** - the Libyan response has been extreme, Obama® has moved warships and marines into the region. In fact they have proposed sending more ""security"" to all embassies around the world in ""counter terrorism"" measures. It certainly seems like an invasion by another name.

**Israel** - Obama® has quite publicly rebuffed Netanyahu's demands for war agains Iran. Like the US government has used [false flag strategies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods), [Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair) (if we can even say it is separate) has a history of them as well. The film was obviously a propaganda film to incite hatred, but if so why not all muslim countries not just Libya? Obviously once the libya thing happened people got brave and it spread, even to the UK. I read I think a likudnik essay from the 70s or 80s about who the military strategy to advance israeli interests should revolve around destabilising neighbours through the provocation of sectarian violence. There was an attempt to frame Israel with the fake ""Sam Bacile"", fake quotes of calling islam caner, and probably fake jewish financiers.

So who knows? My best guess is that this is a media primed to make muslims look as bad as possible, deliberately distract from decades of aggression by UK/US/Israel as a contributing factor, and then like with 9/11, the military industrial complex has started to milk it for all its worth to expand the ""war on terror"". The PNAC essay [Rebuilding America's Defenses](http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf) is one that gives insight into the current military aims of the US and Israel.

true,helencopter,null,null,"It's not just a role reversal, it's a complete dismissal of their dynamic because ultimately, it explains away all of River's drive, her intelligence and knowledge and power and attraction for the Doctor with ""well, because of Doctor"". Not even the Doctor in his own right, she's brainwashed by a third party, told all her life that the Doctor is the coolest by her parents, she's basically raised up with him at the center of her universe. It's like she's this really creepy child bride. 

Just look at their respective first meetings. The first time the Doctor sees River, she's got a leg up on him, she knows all about him and is unsettling to him but he's still in control, he still leads the group and saves the day. There's a bit of a power struggle but it's between two equals and when he saves River, we understand why, she's proven that she will be important to him someday.  Not to mention, to save her all he has to do is plug his screwdriver in, it's not really that impressive. 

Now River's first meeting with the Doctor, we see what I THINK is meant to be a reversal of that. He knows her but she doesn't know him (or not personally), there's a power struggle, and she saves his life. Except the power struggle is now between the Doctor, who's entirely in control of himself, and a brainwashed out of control young woman trying to kill him. And then she eventually decides to save him... why? From what I can tell it's because he's foxy. And to do so she has to give up what amounts to immortality. 

It makes River seem weak, and unimportant in her own right, and in my opinion it kind of makes their relationship pretty creepy considering that River doesn't really seem to have much of a choice in it all. If I were the Doctor I'd be recommending a good therapist for River, because marrying her seems kind of unethical.

I guess what I'm saying is that yes, it is supposed to show their relationship reversing, but it does so and then some. And in the process makes me really uncomfortable with their relationship.

Secondly, I wanted to know where you got the idea that it is the 'de facto gold standard', because it may be true that in parts of Britain it is seen as such, but certainly not everywhere, nor outside Britain either (think of Australia, or Canada...it's certainly not the gold standard there). What you said implies that one 'accent' is 'better' than another, and such subjective prescriptivism is only one way of considering accents. More commonly, linguists try to see accents descriptively which implies that there is no 'better' accent, they should be analysed and seen objectively. They are all just variations. While some people in the UK, particularly those who speak in an RP accent (and possibly the BBC, although they are trying to change that by having regional accent/dialect speakers present the news), may think it's the gold standard, a great many people including linguists refute this notion.

* The Queen can be depicted as appeasing Nazis before it was uncool. Later on she defecates on to a silver tray and has her arse wiped with the neck of a swan. She has a German accent.
* The pair hate each other, have separate beds, separate bathrooms and never make eye contact.
* Charles could be a crazy homeopathist.
* Harry and William are actually enemies, because every time Will looks at Harry all he can see is a flashback to the time he was four when he walked in to see that ginger quiff and ginger balls having at it with his mother whilst Charles was furiously masturbating a limp penis in the corner.
* If it isn't clear James Hewitt is Harry's father.

I'd advise calling the bus station to check the rates (there are three sizes - small, med, large - the medium fits a large duffle bag and a small backpack, large would fit two decent sized suitcases), then do the math to see whether Waverley or the bus station would be the most cost-effective option for the period of time you need to store your stuff for.

If you're storing for more than a few days, maybe think about a locker or small space at a self-storage company? For anything over a week that would definitely be a good option if you can find a convenient place.

Some hostels will store luggage for a small cost even if you're not staying there - worth calling to ask.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"""What to do"", is a question I ask my self quite often. The first thing I did years ago was to stop watching TV. A little later I stopped reading the Guardian and the BBC website because mainstream press is tightly controlled and pro-state. The Guardian is supposed to be left, but for me it reads like another conservative paper taken it its entirety, especially militant or economic articles. It backs capitalism, and backs wars (look at the Syrian and Iran coverage, compare it to the very light Israeli criticism). The same goes for the BBC. Then I stopped watching organised sport, it's promoted for a reason, and a source of wealth inequality. At the same time I refused to partake in consumerism, I gave up driving and buying anything first hand (accept toilet paper and other necessities of course).

I've concluded that colonialism never really ended, politics in the UK is utterly corrupt, and I don't just mean government discourse but the whole socio-economic power distribution, or rather the centralisation to a minority. To elaborate on the colonialism, it morphed into corporatism which echoes imperialism, totalitarian socialism and monarchy. Really they are all flavours of militant dictatorships and differ in scale.

At the heart though is the monetary system. Through it every outsider can be taxed, whilst the insiders have access to tax havens. It also mean that whether you like it or not, anyone trading in pounds is complicit in wars of aggression and further entrenches the status quo. The other problem is representative democracy is a failed electoral model.

In practical terms, the solutions would be independent candidates running on the basis that if they are voted in they will electronically poll this constituency and vote which ever way they do. Hopefully that can go viral and we implement direct democracy without asking for permission. At the same time new monetary systems need to be created that can't be politicised, or that allows money to be hidden in the Cayman Islands.",0,1347663545,null,0,false,0,c68axxd,t3_zvjbq,t1_c68axxd,t1_c68a9fs,null,1429901331,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Here, let's have a line-up contest, because why not:

**SG's projected line-up:**

*Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech; Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Cole; Mikel, Lampard; Ramires, Hazard, Moses; Torres*

*Subs: Turnbull; Luiz, Azpilicueta; Romeu, Bertrand; Piazon, Sturridge*


**ROTS' projected line-up**

*Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech; Azpilicueta, Luiz, Terry, Cole; Mikel, Lampard; Moses, Mata, Hazard; Torres*

*Subs: Turnbull, Cahill, Ivanovic, Bertrand, Romeu, Piazon, Oscar*




Let the projected-line-up-off begin! (Don't forget to come back when the squads are reveiled to check who's the grand winner. Also, I have a strong feeling Cole/Lampard will be rested for Juve, but let's see how it goes.)

Good luck, and of course the prize is becoming the King of Belgium (already sorted with their authorities)


edit: **Actual Line-ups**

*Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech; Ivanovic, Luiz, Terry, Cole; Mikel, Lampard; Ramires, Hazard, Bertrand; Torres*

*Subs: Turnbull, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Romeu, Oscar, Moses, Sturridge*


SG's points: First 11: 9, Subs: 4. Total: 13

RODS' points: First 11: 8, Subs: 4. Total: 12

Amy and Rory have consistently shown that the person they love most is the other.  Amy straight up says that she doesn't want to live without Rory.  Their relationship holds together when Rory waits alone for 2000 years.  Rory is the person Amy loves after being trapped for 36 years alone.  So no, I really don't think the Doctor is the glue that holds them together at all.

That said, I think the divorce angle was stupid.  It was contrived and played quickly for drama in an episode the Ponds shouldn't have been in.  Amy's behavior makes sense from what I have heard first hand from people who discover they're infertile but it doesn't work in the narrative.  Rory knows she's infertile.  Why is there this conflict?   Why are they so quick to divorce?  I think it needed to have just been a fight.  Or if they were going all out divorce, there should have been a serious reason like a miscarriage.

*(1)A person is guilty of an offence if he—
(a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character;*

there's a bit about it [on the CPS website](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/):

&gt; The Communications Act 2003 section 127 covers the sending of improper messages. Section 127(1)(a) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and emails.

So it would appear this is a overly loosely drafted law that is intended to be used against people who send others abusive letters or emails.  It was the same piece of law that was used to convict the Robin Hood airport tweeter. I suspect when it was written, either in the lead up to 2003 or previous to that (and inherited from a previous law), Facebook and Twitter were not mainstream, or perhaps didn't exist at all, so this idea of moving 'pub chatter' level conversation into written and electronic communication didn't exist.

Also, I found [this blog](http://www.pitkanary.com/category/commuications-act/), whose author went to the trial. There's some interesting stuff on there:

&gt; A further statement came from one Samir Ahmed (no relation). **Less than three hours after Azhar Ahmed’s Facebook post, an address and telephone number had been published on Facebook by persons unspecified, which purported to be Azhar Ahmed’s details. They were actually Samir Ahmed’s details, and in the following few hours, starting from around 22:00 hours, they received a deluge of abusive phone calls, mostly racial in content. These continued relentlessly for hours. At around midnight,  cars started pulling up outside the house, and torches were shone in through windows.** This went on until past 1:00am the following day. The witness testified that they have since had to change their telephone number.

And linked from there, [this article](http://harrypaterson.co.uk/politics-current-affairs/a-tale-of-two-states-azhar-ahmed-and-scott-mchugh) about responses to Ahmed's post:

* On March 12th, one Scott McHugh, who appears to be a serving soldier, posted on his Facebook wall, in response to Ahmed’s comments, “Azhar ahmed you sick horrible twisted paki bastard, how can you say that about our soldiers!” McHugh was joined by several of his friends, some of whom commented as follows…

* Leighanne Gillott: ” He’s disgusting and should be fucking hanged!! **He won’t get away with it, locked up or not somebody will get him, he will get what he deserves!!x”**

* Lee Crisculo: **”Fucking sick twat burn his eyes out smelly fukka”**

* Helen Massey Gordge:  ”Cheeky smelly pakki cunt wants tying to a tree n shooting …Smelly fukker..Lock him up n throw the key away ..Grrrhhhh….SKUM…!!”

* Robbie Joedys Sampler: ” He’s nothing he’s gunner die veryy soon”

* Danielle Lufc Harker: **”Dirty smelly greasy bastard needs fuking torturing the dirty paki bastard!!”**

Unsurprisingly, none of these people come up on Google News as having been pursued by the police, even though their offenses in my opinion are significantly more serious (involving direct threats and incitement to violence).

There are some teams that are passed down through family generations and are hard to see ever being sold.  Usually these are football or baseball teams but it can be in any sport.  Teams like the Dallas NY Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL are examples of ""legacy"" teams like that.  You also have teams like the Dallas Cowboys or New York Yankees where the team becomes so closely associated to the owner that it is hard to see them being sold at any price.  These teams often go through big upheavals when the owner dies, although the Yankees have seemed to dodge that particular pitfall by becoming a legacy franchise when their iconic owner, George Steinbrenner (of Seinfeld fame) died.

You also get teams where the ownership is closely tied to a media empire.  The best example is the basketball team the New York Knicks who are owned by Cablevision, which is the dominant cable TV system in their home city.  The team and media arm become linked so, while the team could conceivably be sold, the price would be prohibitive for anyone who doesn't also own a media empire.

They're flying it directly at the Dalek ship, to give the Daleks the opportunity to hit them with missiles. They want the Daleks to do that so that they can use the explosion to power the Extrapolator that they confiscated from Flon Fal Von Slitheen in Boom Town.

true,sofsof,null,null,"That is one of the really wonderful and powerful things about Doctor Who to me.  He's lost his entire race, his home, he will outlive all of his companions and he sees terrible things day after day after day, and because time isn't linear for him there's no real end to it all.

But even though the Doctor *could* give up, and he *could* be bitter, and angry, and unleash his terrible self on the world - this is how it goes in movies, and books, and all the other TV shows, you know; something goes awry in someone's life, and they have all this power and they use it in terrible ways until someone comes along and shows them the light, etc etc etc - he doesn't.  The Doctor just keeps on going, and keeps on going with a light and a hope and a joy that shines through everything.  You see it in The Doctor Dances (one of my favorites: ""Just this once, Rose! Everybody lives!""), the episode with Van Gogh, and so many others.  Terrible things happen, and the Doctor remains steadfast through it all.  It changes him, but it doesn't make him a different person, he doesn't have to change who he is to cope with things.

I guess I'm rambling a little.  I just wanted to say that I really understand what you mean when you say the Doctor has saved your life.  I've found myself in points in my life when there is nothing left, just despair and an emptiness and a huge pressing weight and it's the worst feeling.  And then I remind myself - The Doctor can do this.  The Doctor has been through terrible things, but he still sees that light and hope and joy, and he still lives his life, and *I can too.*

So, even though it will be a while before you can watch the Doctor and feel his magic (to me, it *is* magic), that doesn't mean it has to be a while before you feel the way the Doctor makes you feel.  Print out your favorite quotes, create art (even if it's shitty art, creation is good), surround yourself with the Doctor and remind yourself of the way he makes you feel.  

Also, they have a few Doctor Who books, so maybe you could get them from the library?

Best of luck to you.  You can always get on reddit at the library, and we are all here for you, thick and thin, just like the Doctor.

Jesus, how much money do they think benefit claimants get?

I had to sign on last winter. I got £240 in housing benefit to cover my £275 rent on a shared terraced house. The rest I had to make up from my £56 a week Jobseeker's allowance (I was 24 so on the lower rate).

Sometimes I didn't have enough money for food or gas. I had to take a cold shower before an interview once.

£22,000 is significantly more than I earn now before tax for full time work. Some of these people have no idea what it's like to be poor. Oh, and not every claimant has 'never done a days work in their lives'. We're in a bloody recession and even for the employed we have colossal income disparity.

true,mountainfail,null,null,"Definitely this. Remember Uni is a chance to discover yourself - so be prepared to spend money socialising, gaining experiences, investing in resources you will use later in life otherwise you will have a pretty sorry few years. 

Otherwise, as other people have said, the key thing is to budget budget budget. Did I say budget? Figure out what you can spend each week, knock off ten percent and work with the rest. The 10% can act as an emergency fund. However, its also worth investing early into something which could last your whole time at Uni.

Learn to cook - and I don't just mean beans on toast, PM me and I'll send you some basic recipes if you want. Its cheaper when cooking for yourself than relying on ready meals, and much healthier. But also invite people round or cook for your housemates. Its cheaper than going out, and if everyone brings a dish to share its even better, plus you get to try new stuff.

If you need to travel locally (within, say 15 miles) don't get a car or rely on buses but buy a bike. Secondhand is fine, but try to avoid a Halfords or supermarket job, they tend to be of very low quality. Learn how to look after it. It will keep you fit, give you great insight into the local area (you see much more on a bike than you do in a car or in public transport) and can be a very cheap way of getting about. A bike is something I would recommend investing in - get a fairly decent one (~£100-£150 for a second hand one) and it should last you through Uni and beyond.

My BIGGEST regret is taking up drinking when in Uni. Ten years on its something I still struggle with and its a HUGE moneypit.

Do you drop cigarettes on the ground (I'm presuming you're a cigarette smoker because of the dirty work you do)? You and a lot of people do this every day. It is an issue that frustrates a lot of ordinary citizens. Yesterday I walked past 2 people in the space of 2 minutes who dropped their cigarettes in front of me on the street. So would you like to be the poster boy with headings of ""disgusting, immoral litterer!""? Or would you rather a council fine and just learn from it?

What about the woman caught on the tram ranting racistly? Surely it would have been better to receive a police caution or fine - rather than becoming a better known poster girl than Nick Griffin! I don't see the black woman caught racistly ranting becoming an everyday celebrity - so the tram woman was certainly treated disproportionately.

On iTunes you can access their offerings sorted by Doctor by selecting menus following these steps in order:  iTunes Store; TV Shows; Category - Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy (top right drop down); More in TV - Doctor Who (second from bottom right drop down); then you have the listings from Eleventh Doctor at the top to First Doctor at the bottom.

Now, if you want to know where the available episodes from either of these sources fall within the original broadcast order, this Wikipedia guide is your friend:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials

Let me say right away that In Classic Who, viewing order is nowhere near as important as the new series. Most serials were stand-alone stories, multi-episode story arcs were the exception, not the rule. There were a few connected stories, notably the Trial of a Time-Lord season, the E-Space Trilogy, the Black Guardian Trilogy; and The Key to Time Series. Other than that, you really don't have to worry a lot about watching the episodes in order. Personally, I like skipping around from Doctor to Doctor for variety. Otherwise, even Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor would get pretty old after seven seasons!

Some people even approach it in different ways, one Redditor was planning on watching all the Dalek episodes in order.

We've only played one game at home so far this season and we saw ranks of South Koreans in the stands. They appeared like magic. The guys with Park hairstyles, brand new Park QPR shirts, cameras and unmovable smiles. 

Park had an unremarkable opener in which we lost 0-5 to Swansea, the first time in history we've ever lost to Swansea at home and our worst league home defeat since the early 80's.

The South Korean-looking fans gave park an enthusiastic standing ovation as he left the field while standing next to shell-shocked and silent Rangers fans.

It happens at every club. I went to QPR games as a kid in the 80's, lost interest in the 90's, when I went to a college outside of London as we dropped through the leagues; but I remember in the mid-00's attendances of about 7,000 at Loftus road. Only the super hardcore could stick-out the awfulness of what was on display in some seasons. 
But I still have to drop my head when some supporters talk of 50,000 QPR fans travelling to Wembley to see our League 1 promotional play-offs....... as I didn't go.

There are good and bad points to our recent ""successes"". Now the players seem very distant to the fans, they don't come and chat to us after games like the old ones did. they are on multi-million contracts and we don't have whip-rounds at the end of games to buy new players.

What motivates our supporters and our players now is different to what motivated them before. I don't see how it can be any different.

There were some 'health and safety nightmares' (forges, welding kit etc) but you know what, no-one i know of ever got maimed or killed using any of the equipment. 

In all, done the correct way and with the right attitude, using hand and machine tools helps people to actually 'create'. Too much in this world is gained from acquisition/purchasing, yet so much can be taught from making: discipline, judgement, pride, interaction with others and collaboration. Most of all, making teaches respect for others and their projects (no matter how trivial) because to them, it means a lot and we can appreciate the time and effort expended.

The lessons learned at school (metalwork,woodwork) were invaluable to me. I've learnt so much more since, but the seed was sown in the correct way.

true,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"&gt;Depends why I'm taking your photo.....

First of all gotta give you credit for replying knowing full well you'd likely get a lot of flak

&gt;If I'm taking your photo because you've done something good, then yeah I'll come say hello, and talk to you. You've done something good why would you not want your photo took?

Many, many reasons foremost being copyright and then redistribution. As I understand it you or your employer would own copyright and could use it for any legal purpose without permission including distributing it. As for the latter once it gets online there is no knowing what will happen although I do recognise you can't possibly be blames for it.

&gt;If you've done something bad then fuck you. Its public interest, say if you've killed someone, hurt an animal (photographed some people who abused a monkey once(only in Dudley)) or just generally been a prick.

You need to define bad and public interest - the terms are too vague especially for tabloid reporters. If you've been convicted by a court I find no problem in naming/taking pictures without permission but not beforehand as it's a sad fact the press goes with guilty even if proven innocent. Again, I'm not sure if you write or not so I'll assume you have no control over text.

&gt;Theres times when neither of these happen tho , such as sunny day shots, you know the kinda thing, girls on a beach , kids in fountains/ eating ice cream. No need to interact with people then, take a shot and move on. If you ask me what I'm doing, I'll explain.

Out of interest are kids a legal minefield where pictures are concerned?

&gt;The thing that pisses me off immensely is when I'm photographing a shop, IE Tesco (because you sold out to America), The Job centre (because there was a story involving it) and staff come out and tell me I can't take photos in the street. Only thing worse is when they call the police, and they are daft enough to oblige and come and have a chat with me...................

After fifty years of rubber monsters and even more rubbery actors, in Britiain it is a national institution that is generally met with forgiving affection.  It is a show that has often been painfully cheap yet has somehow survived through ignominy and death - some take that as a metaphor for the underdog spirit of our country itself.

We figured out the trick to generating sparks was to have massive air spaces between the two pieces of metal so we used to furtively make fork like constructions and see if we could set something on fire. We never managed that, but we did get a torrent of sparks to go a good 40 feet or so.

Also, I really enjoyed nailing pencil cases to the workbench. Those tin ones with the folding tops were the best.

Interestingly the ""grammar"" site had woodwork and cookery and the secondary mod. site had technical drawing and metalwork. Our first task in woodwork was to make a T-square to use in technical drawing. This was in the North East in the 80's and the idea seemed to be to prepare us to go work in the engineering businesses of the Tyne/Tees conurbation that the government of the day was doing its best to shut down. But that's another story. 

We had supervised but largely free access to centre lathes for woodworking, turret lathes and drill presses for metalwork, sanding and grinding belts and disks of all kinds, a chip forge and anvil, and eventually a workshop well enough equipped that some of the staff would service their cars there. I don't recall any notable accidents—everyone got ""bitten"" by a vice at some point, and there was the odd burn, but nothing too gruesome.

Or as a university grad you will be paying more tax anyway, so you deserve the benefits which help you do so.

You will want to get a job so you don't have to get the Maintenance loan, you might be able to get a maintenance grant for a bit. The Student finance will manage all of your 'benefits' so dont worry about that.

Save money on booze/goingout by predrinking with cider or /r/Homebrewing 

Eat primarily with carbs like pasta/rice/potatoes and make cheap soups out of cheap veg and chickens. Spice it up and it tastes great. Take a pack lunch you prepared the night before to eat at lunchbreak, take a 1l bottle or thermos for drinks.

Only go out once a week or fortnight and spend the other nights at a friends house party (usually there are loads).

Don't worry about the student debt man, it is essentially just a tax in the PAY-E system that you pay when you earn above 21k. It is not hard to deal with. If you do take pack lunch, make it look cool or stylish in a nice box or something. G

Gardening pays about 6-10 quid an hour, more if you have a car and tools.

Jobs in service are usually the best for students though, if you have any skills think of ways to make money for them.

true,Redditambassador,hampshire,The best of the Shires !,"My experiences of 'shop' in school were very different when i started my A-levels, this is 17 years ago in a public comprehensive school. 

So the years before GCSE's were divided into:

* Home economics
* IT
* Woodwork
* Metalwork
* Electronics
* Sewing (forget what they called it)

You had a few weeks of each every year, then before GCSE's started you had to pick one which you would then spend the next 2 years focused on. I went with woodwork, but since i did not want a CD rack, a spice rack, a small mitred box for ""stuff"", I was allowed to build myself a case for all my archery stuff.

The teachers seemed to be more concerned with preventing us from hurting ourselves or each other with any hand tools (and this was all we were allowed to use) consequently the tools that were available were in a fairly poor state of repair, from blunt chisels (more dangerous if you ask me) through to mitre saws and everything in return. 

Workshop time vs classroom time 10 / 90% split.

When I went ahead and did an A-Level in design tech, besides being 50% of the class it was a whole new ball game, all of a sudden the 'materials workshop' was open for my use:

* Lathes (wood and metal work)
* Welding (arc, mig and tig)
* Bench saws
* Planer thicknesser
* Bandsaws (wood and metal work)
* Milling machine
* Morticer

Power tools (everything and all sorts)

The tech workshops, once it had been demonstrated that you were not a complete 'tool' and were not going to do anything daft, were then pretty much open to me whenever i needed or wanted to do something (this is where my love of robotics also stems from). 

TL:DR Good with my hands, can french polish, weld, metal work and anything in timber is a challenge which is very much enjoyed.

You work for 40 years until you’re young enough to enjoy your retirement. You party, drink alcohol, and are generally promiscuous, and then you are ready for high school. You then go to primary school, you become a kid, and you play. You have no responsibilities; you become a baby until you are born.

My parents have a mortgage which is the best part of £200k and they live in a really nice 5 bed bungalow. They freely admit that they put too much emphasis on the house they live in, but the large mortgage is mainly down to a massive drainage problem that required remortgaging. After taking my two younger sisters into consideration, and the fact that the house is oil heated, my parents decided that they would be unable to provide me with any money whilst I was studying.

I had about £3500 worth of savings from my part-time job, and I got a part-time job during term time that paid about £50-100 a week. I stayed in self-catered halls which cost £505.02 a month (far from the most expensive, but not the cheapest).

The class room helper pretty much made all my stuff for me as I could not cut anything for fear of losing a finger. What made it even worse was my inability to draw anything resembling a straight line even with a ruler. 
My bird box looked like it had been designed by Salvador Dali and had to be cut out by the classroom helper. Somehow I painted the inside with toxic varnish and mistakenly nailed the top down so you could not clean it out to be reused. My crap hammering meant the nail tips poked out dangerously. No bird would nest in that shit hole which made the project really difficult as we were supposed to put them up in our gardens and monitor the birds in a diary.  I thought I was being clever by putting a dead crow on top of the bird box and taking pictures of it in various poses as if it was living in my box. These pictures were placed throughout the project. Problem was the little entrance hole was tiny, probably for a blue tit or something.      The old guy who taught us never said a word about how ridiculous and disturbing the final result was, I think I got a C.  

The next term woodwork was cancelled as a punishment because somebody had stolen all of the drill bits.  It was not me but I won't deny I was relieved. This was an all girl’s school in about 1995.

* Mr Metalwork: ""Let me do that for you, else you could have an eye out.""
* Mr Electronics: ""if you want to learn, sit at the front, if you are going to ass about, can you sit at the back  please""

Mr Woodwork and Metal work were hard asses, bitter, hated children and saw us as an epic inconvenience, Mr Electronics (was a relatively young teacher looking back on it now) and he had knowledge he wanted to share, he wanted that light to come on when he explained something to us, we understood and could apply our newly found knowledge, he was an awesome teacher.  

**Influence of access to tools**

To start with a great source of frustration, why doesn't that fit, why has that split, why is it twisted .. perseverance, trial and error, practice practice practice and the rule of 'measure twice, cut once' and i soon realised hey, i can do this. Never overly ambitious to start off with, so little things, discovering the joys of a dovetail that fits, that looks good, I still have a box of stuff from school at my parents house. 

Electronics is a whole other story - as there were those who were genuinely interested in how stuff worked and those that were not. Electronics club after school started, I can still remember playing with my first IC and thinking, oh, my, god - i made this work, it went from there and the light is still burning these days. 

My final piece for my A-levels was a welsh dresser and rack, built in oak with elm cross banding detailing to the drawer fronts and top french polished and loved in my parents house ever since. 

I have been to several timber framing week long workshops and plan in future to build my own timber framed house at some point when time and money permit. 

These days, Im a civil engineer by profession but an avid / very capable DIY'er.

* hanging my own new front door and all the door furniture that comes with that.

Some of the children are completely uninterested, but some are mad keen, as you can imagine. Their 'work' usually consists of bits of wood with some nails hammered in, however, some children really go for it - attaching different bits and materials together to make 'sculptures' and 'machines'.

Woodwork has *loads* of benefits for very young children: cause and effect; fine motor skills; planning; vocabulary and language development; problem solving; social problem solving; science/maths skills... I could go on.

Many, many reasons foremost being copyright and then redistribution. As I understand it you or your employer would own copyright and could use it for any legal purpose without permission including distributing it. As for the latter once it gets online there is no knowing what will happen although I do recognise you can't possibly be blames for it.

Well yes, as you can imagine. You're a doctor whos cured cancer, so I come take your photo. 3 weeks later we find out you touch kids, hey presto we've already got your photo.

You need to define bad and public interest - the terms are too vague especially for tabloid reporters. If you've been convicted by a court I find no problem in naming/taking pictures without permission but not beforehand as it's a sad fact the press goes with guilty even if proven innocent. Again, I'm not sure if you write or not so I'll assume you have no control over text.

Well by the time I've took the photo, chances are we will know the verdict , or you're just in court for the photo.

Out of interest are kids a legal minefield where pictures are concerned?
Meh , theres no reason why you cant take photos in public of anything. If you're jo bloggs the police might say something but as press no one cares about that kinda stuff.

This is why I walk to the other side of the street whenever I see a camera. :-p but I do not like the implication that I either have something to hide or am paranoid for not wanting my picture taken.

Thats good, it means you dont end up in my shots. But also I might want that guy walking thru the picture . I might even ask you to walk past me with a tesco bag , or maybe an Asda one if it fits to the story.

As far as fact checking goes, the only facts they could check were the ones coming from police reports, which we now know was a bad idea because they were all fraudulently edited to cover up police negligence.

Also, it's worth pointing out that The Sun isn't the only newspaper guilty of this. The Daily Express, The Evening Standard, Daily Star and Merseyside's own Liverpool Daily Post also printed these headlines based on false police reports. But where is the ire for those publications? Non-existent it seems.

The Sun rightly hold their hands up to their grave mistake and are certainly not burying it under the carpet. But let's not blame Hillsborough or the cover-up on them. Blame it on the people who are responsible, the certain members of the South Yorkshire Police.

He didn't really get any chances period, so it wasn't like he had opportunities and pissed them away. The entire match we didn't look much interested in attacking except on the counter. Subbing him at halftime would have been rash, but I do think the switch for sturridge came too late. And needless to say, him storming off down the tunnel is just unacceptable. He has no one to be upset with except himself. 

Sturridge won't start over Torres against Juve, and he shouldn't. One poor performance doesn't justify Torres losing his place for the next game, especially one as important as Champions League. Such rash overreaction is what led to his dip in confidence last season. I'm not suggesting he should never be benched, but one poor performance shouldn't justify dropping him. I would agree that Sturridge deserves more time on the pitch, and hopefully Roberto will see to it that he does.

People complain because since the start of last season he has 14 goals in 54 games, obviously poor. People think he deserves to start every game because everybody else is not meeting his standards and supplying him properly, yet Sturridge shows actual threat and is deemed not good enough for more than a cameo role as the focal point. What dip in confidence? The whole season where he was essentially rubbish bar a couple of games? Not a great return

People seem to think he was immense the first few games this season, he was good but not great. One of his two goals was when he drifted offside and he was lucky to score, the other was well worked and a good finish. I think Chelsea have been without a leading striker for so long people have forgotten just what is expected. Didier has been on the slide for a couple of seasons and a few epic moments last season were spread over months where he looked a shadow of his former self, 09-10 was probably his last great year

So he pretty much didn't have any sense of direction or understanding of the lessons at all. One guy in our class cleverly came up with the phrase: ""Mr Nuttin, he doesn't know Nothin'."" As bad as it all seemed, they were still very good times.

The first time I saw her was in a BBC show '[Balderdash and Piffle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balderdash_and_Piffle)' where she searched for the original meaning of words and phrases. The two I remember most distinctly were about the word 'Coswollop', and the phrase 'pear shaped', meaning something has gone a bit wrong. IIRC 'pear shaped' came from when show planes would try to make a circle in the sky with that sky-writing foam thingy (sorry, i dont know anything about planes), but they would get their trajectory off slightly and it would make a circle with a bulge that looks like a Pear to people on the ground. Quite interesting, like a lot of the show. 

She also hosts the quiz show 'Only Connect' which is more in the 'University Challenge' vain of quiz where it can get pretty damn hard. There's no audience just a team of players trying to solve logical and word puzzles and stuff. Again, quite an interesting quiz show imho. 

I only found out about her poker exploits after these two shows, so when I saw her name I thought it was a good guest choice, and I enjoyed her contributions throughout.

If, on a bar crawl, you're not drinking at a given venue (saving money for a different/cheaper bar) you can always ask for a glass of free tap water - licensing laws in the UK are such that they cannot refuse this request. This at least mean you have a glass in front of you which can help if you're used to having a drink with you in a pub.

I left school in the early '90's and see that all kinds of things have changed.

We were lucky to have a wonderful teacher at our school for C.D.T (Craft, Design, Technology). He taught us things about using lathes and tools, how electric works and some resource management really.

Some of the projects I remember - 

a) Make a CD case using the vacuum former, plastic and dowel.

b) Make a 'game' out of some simple electronics, circuits and things not computers.

d) Work in groups to make a cupboard, table or other thing that had to be planned out. With different groups using some tools to make certain bits of it and others doing other parts (some designing doors, some doing a frame, others making the utility).

That was really good because each group had a spokesman which I suppose you could call the 'project manager' (an exercise could go on for a few days/weeks).

He was one of my favourite teachers, time changes memory like this but i remember him being very patient and genuinely interested.

That was last season. Torres and the team have moved on and a new season has begun, so we now can only judge him on his current form. As you said, so far this season he's been good. One bad performance doesn' justify dropping him. Let him build on his form that has been much better this season than last. His abysmal performances last season doesn't mean he should be kept on a short leash this season, and even if it *did*, he's only had one poor game? Just calm down, and let the lad play. 

I think everyone would agree we're thin at striker, and reinforcements should and probably will be brought in. But because of this we must try to manage what we do have to the best of our abilities. This would mean not overreacting to one game and benching our first choice striker, thus further damaging his confidence and making our already thin strike force, even thinner.

In the classic series The Doctor is one of many Timelords, however, most of the Timelords are content to stay on the home world of Gallefrey and play politics. The Doctor is a rogue Timelord whose allegiance could best be described as chaotic good. He is a rogue because he does what he wants not what the Timelords want (not that he ever does anything bad/evil) and that drives them batshit insane. They do manage to on multiple occasions manage to coerce the Doctor into doing favors for them (usually when Timelord race is in danger). On one of these occasions The Doctor managed to get elected president (not sure if that is correct formal title) of the Timelords and he tries to reject it since he will be forced to stay at home and he basically is a lone ronin (other than his companions that he picks up from time to time). Although he cannot formally renounce his office he basically selects one of the Timelords to rule for him in absentia (kind of a Hand of the King from Game of Thrones if you will) so he can go wander the galaxy.

Warning general minor spoilers involving the time war ahead.

In the reboot (starting with Chris Eccleston, this is why people refer to him as the 9th Doctor, in the Classic Who 8 Doctors preceded him)  the Timelords and the Daleks start a Time War, The Doctor finds out the Timelords have devolved into colossal jerks and The Doctor Time locks all the Timelords and the Daleks (hence no more Timelords and supposedly Daleks). Since The Doctor was the guy who pushed the button he is/was outside of the Time lock and is free to do whatever he wants.

Cachers hide caches in their local area, be it urban or rural, and other users try to find them. In the wilderness they tend to be Tupperware containers containing silly little goodies (if you take something, leave something) and a log book, in urban areas they're normally magnetic, bullet sized containers with just a log.

You find caches and navigate to them using the website, a GPS device, a smart phone or any combination of the three. The simple ones just point you to the cache, the harder ones involve puzzle solving, decoding the next set of co-ordinates or e-mailing proof of being in the right place to the owner of the cache.

true,spudboyblues,present,Mata,"I've since gotten some lunch and tempered my frustration that QuntPark held us goalless. Some (kind of) measured thoughts:

Terry's ankle doesn't really look 100%; he plays through it like a boss though. I just hope it doesn't become chronic or a long term problem. Luiz was really solid, and made several great defensive plays. He took his usual runs forward but they seemed tempered by his knowing when he can take that liberty. He's learning, and once he gets really smart about that I think he'll really be world class. Cole and Iva were really strong as well - great showing from the back four. 

Mikel was really fantastic aside from that one moment I'd like to forget ever happened. It's like he couldn't lose the ball in the first half! He was a rock in the CDM. MoTM for me. I think that if he were paired with a better passer we would have a really great combo. Lampard...looks less and less like he fits with this lineup. He consistently lobbed balls forward for Torres like he was looking for Drogba. Again, like in Atletico, he was often too far forward to link Defense with Attack, which stalled our attacking play significantly. I wonder if Romeu could develop into a visionary CDM-Passer-Modric-ish type player/if Oscar or Ramires can step into those shoes. 

Probably Ramires before Oscar at this rate, because he looked a lot better defensively than offensively. He lit up a little bit as the game got on, but he was back and made some fantastic tackles in our third/the middle third. Offensively he was lacking, which is why I feel like he might do well alongside Mikel or Romeu - even if he can't pass that well his dribbling ability means that he can very quickly move the ball from deep in our half into the opposition's half. I dunno, just thoughts. He didn't look that great out wide, and I think it's at the least worth a shot. Moses looked really great all the way out there - really stretched the play wide on the right, and could have scored. Can't wait to watch this man grow and be a beast alongside Lukaku someday - what a formidable duo to look forward to. Hazard was really bright, and you know, for all that he's done these first few games he's really worked hard for 9/10 of our points, so I can't fault the man for missing a sitter. Nobody's perfect. Regroup, come out stronger next time, and if he's the team player he says he is, he'll apologize and work to get better. Here's to hoping...oh, and we really missed Mata's creativity. Hazard can't do everything by himself. 

Torres was pretty poor today, but again, nobody's perfect. I really hope this game fires him up, but it's hard to say. His stomping off like that is pretty petty, and piss poor imo. Man up, work hard, and show us you deserve to start, because Sturry really made a case for starts at least in Carling/League Cup/maybe even some Prem games. He looked really bright and made the most of his changes. 

Overall, on a different day we might have put away our chances. Can't win em all, and at least we didn't lose. Pretty fucking terrible officiating. A couple of penalty shouts, Torres and Hazard got really roughed up, and...no yellows for ANYBODY on QPR? Well, enough said. Lots to think about - for having not really trained together for two-ish weeks, to not lose isn't the worst thing in the world.

The Gallifreyans long ago developed a very high level of technology, and eventually created a black hole known as the Eye of Harmony by causing a star nearby their own to go nova. The Eye gave them the power to develop time travel. They used it to power a type of sentient living machines called TARDISs (Time And Relative Dimensions in Space). Time Travel and the molecular/genetic engineering that made them able to master it changed the Gallifreyans and they thus became Time Lords. They differ from humans in several ways, they have two hearts, they can survive dangerous atmospheres or no atmosphere for a limited time, and when they are mortally injured they can regenerate. When regeneration occurs the Time Lord becoms a semi-new person who has the memories and experience of the previous regenerations. Historically, they could only regenerate twelve times, and so would lead thirteen lives. The Doctor is in his eleventh incarnation (played by Matt Smith). He is the last known member of his species, as the rest have been killed in a genocidal Time War with the Daleks.

true,punkfunkymonkey,null,null,"My mum qualified as an art teacher and so when the whole CDT thing rolled out in schools she found herself teaching graphics in a department that had previously been ran as a trad woodwork and metal work department by an oldschool teacher called Pete, the kind of teacher kids didn't fuck around with and senior management tried the best not to have to deal with unless they really had to. The school was in pretty rough part of Manchester, high rates of pregnancy, lots of vandilism, fights, police always there, kids with biro and pin tatoos type of place. 
One of her favourite stories goes something like this :-    

Pete heard a bunch of kids quietly talking around a work bench 'Yeah that's how it's done...he's had it done...it won't be that bad, yeah it would be quick...well you could go into town but that would cost...Your left one...if you do it, I will' that kind of stuff which he kept an ear on but basically tried to look like he was ignoring what was going on.  
After a while he heard 'Ask sir, he'll let you know if it will work!'... 'sir...sir...SIR',  
""What do you want, the works set you know what you are supposed to be doing"" said Pete, 'Sir can you pierce your ear with a hammer and nail?' a kid asked ""Yes, in theory you could pierce an ear with a hammer and nail, but why anyone would want to pierce there ears I wouldn't know... now get back to your projects"" he replied.( This was back in the days when men were pretty much just starting to get their ears pierced)     

The kids kept chattering away in the same way until they called his attention again ""What do you want now?"", 'if I got my ear pierced with a hammer and nail would it hurt?' one of them woridly asked ""yes"" he replied, ""it would hurt, and again why anyone would want to have their ears pierced I wouldn't know... now get back to work""  
More chatter with persuaive pleadings occur followed by another call to Pete   


""Yes, what do you want?"", 
'Can I have a hammer and nail?', 
""What for?"", 'to get my ear pierced', ""I don't think it's a good idea, It's going to hurt a lot and anyway why would you want your ear pierced?"", 'Oh go on sir, don't be tight' the kids chorused, so Pete thought he'd try something. He knew they were thinking about using a pin hammer and a small nail so he popped into the store room  and came back with a 6"" nail and a lump hammer in an attempt to put an end to the idea.    

""There you go"" as he dropped the hammer and nail down on the work bench ""but for the record I don't think it's one of your better ideas, best all around if you get back  to your projects you've wasted a lot of time this lesson""  
The kid who was going to get his ear pierced looks a bit shaken and the rest don't apear so keen anymore 'Yeah, I don't think I'll bother anymore!' none of the other kids seemed that keen either so Pete goes ""Right, now get back to work""    

Five minutes later after he thinks all has been settled he heard a loud bang followed instantly with an even louder scream, he runs over to the table to find one kid nailed to desk by his ear (left ear naturally) another kid stood over him looking shocked with a hammer in his hand and the rest of the class either in shock, screaming  or swearing. He grabs the hammer and grabs the nail just as the door bursts open and in runs the head teacher who had been passing by and heard the comotion. Pete looks round, nail in one hand, hammer in the other looks at the head teacher who blurts out ""Pete, Pete what have you done‽""
