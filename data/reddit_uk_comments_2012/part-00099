We don't have insurance, we have taxation (NI is a part of our taxation system). And that is compulsory and we would be fined or jailed if we didn't pay.

There is no evidence of that. The many studies that have been conducted have shown the opposite to be true.

&gt;while the millions who need health care will increase.

* Die in *Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead*
* Not defeat the Weeping Angels in *The Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone*
* Bullies a fat guy, tricks some fake Romans and can't stop the Tardis from exploding in *The Pandorica Opens*
* Makes a Dalek beg for mercy, *without* showing a good reason why in *The Big Bang*

* I'll admit, almost killing the Doctor and fighting Nazi in *Let's Kill Hitler* was fairly impressive, but she was basically a villain in that episode so it's not something to praise her about

Both RTD and Moffat could write some wonderful individual episodes but they both have a problem with the overarching plots. They always end up falling short. It's no surprise to me that Moffat has seemed to recognize this and is focusing on more individual stories next series.

I have to also agree with you on River Song. Alex Kingston is a wonderful actress, but the character of River Song has fallen far short of expectations. Maybe it's suppose to be a tragic love tale between her and the Doctor but I've yet to see any evidence that suggests the two really love one another. River certainly likes the Doctor and flirts with him quite a bit. The Doctor certainly likes River but I think it's more like he likes all of his companions.

Her being [spoiler](#s ""Rory and Amy's kid"") came off to me as very fan fiction. That's the thing I've come to understand however. Steven Moffat is living the dream we all have. He's a giant fan who not only gets to write for the show he grew up but also run it.

Overall, I think Steven Moffat has been good for Doctor Who. However, there have been some flaws in his run. I probably wouldn't mind them as much if there wasn't such a rabid fanbase that says everything he does or 11 does is the greatest thing ever.

I understand all that.


But saying an MP should talk to homeless people instead of doing other stuff is stupid man. Homeless people will talk about being homeless, they can't address how to fix the situation or any viable cost effective methods of how to change peoples lives around and have them be productive members of society.

If you feel as if you could do this, go to a homeless shelter yourself, talk to the people yourself, change around say.. 5peoples lives? Have them vouch for you, train other volunteers to do what you do, make a company out of it that gains government funding... MP's would gladly personally contract companies such as that, with a proven track record because paying you would pay back when these currently unemployed people begin paying taxes... 

..or you can just chat drivel on the internet about 'MPS SHOULD GO TO HOMELESS SHELTERS AND LEARN HOW TO MAKE ROLLIES OUT OF THE PLASTIC OFF THEIR SLEEPING BAGS', homeless people can tell MP's nothing they don't already know that is worthwhile knowledge.

There's things he's done like give the players a day off for Christmas and then we've been thrashed at home, so he says he'll never make that mistake again. It's a gradual process of learning what flies and what does. I like him but because we're the first team on his CV I don't think we'll ever get his best years out of him while he's at Oldham. 

He's done incredibly well with the budget he's got, but being Paul Dickov - Man City legend - can only get you so far. We've finished the seasons 16 and 17th place, when before christmas we we're gunning for a playoff spot. Because we're inheriently a small squad when there are injuries and suspensions we often loose our form quickly and take time to regain it. He's a very dedicated manager and bought a load of cameras out of his own pocket to record each game and analyse it afterwards to help him improve, so you can't fault him in that respect. 

I desperately want us to finish mid table this season, some sign that his plan is working. We're the type of team that if we get promoted it'll be via the playoffs, so we've got to learn to some consistency, and he'll only get better at managing with time. As a fan I mustn't forget that he's only 2/3 years into his managerial carer and he's not the finished article at all.

The real plot hole here is how the old man uses the time travel ability is not consistent with the way Curtis uses it, despite it being the same power. Curtis couldn't teleport through time to wherever and whenever he wanted to be - he literally rewound (or in some cases fast forward) time to an earlier part of his life. When the old man time travels, he doesn't rewind - he remains an old man - and he manages to simply land himself right next to Hitler, despite the fact he was never actually there in his past. 

To answer the OP: there isn't exactly more than one Kelly/parallel Kelly's - at least there shouldn't be with the way Curtis uses his power. He rewinds, and if events change, he has memory of *every* set of events that led up to the present. Think of it as the branches of the tree - he can remember what happened in every branch he participated in including the one that is currently happening, whereas everyone else can only remember what happened in the ""current"" branch, not any of the others.

Rose: The first leaving of rose was really bad but that got fixed on the second leaving.

Mickey: he had his girl leave him and was blamed for it. Then she came back and was no longer close. She leaves and comes back again and became even farther from him and then got stuck with her in another universe probably always moping about the doctor then they finally came back and he hooked up with Martha. (This one sounds quite bad to me though he does end up fine)

Martha: She didn't end up too bad, marrying Mickey in the end.

Donna: She went from normal, to traveler, to being Doctor Donna, to normal again. From an outside perspective her story is really sad but from hers it isn't.

Wilf: I thinke he ends kinda badly. He watches Donna go from bitchy to not as bad back to bitchy. Spends his time searching for the doctor hoping he can fix her, missing how she used to be when she knew him. Then ends up causing the doctor to ""die"". His story sounds quite terrible because he has to live knowing if his grand-daughter remembers she will die but she was so much better for the time spent with The Doctor.

Captain Jack Harkness. Before we meet him even he has already had it bad. He had years of his life erased, ends up causing mass mutations, dies and is brought back, then left behind and forgotten. Finds The Doctor finally who runs away from him and kills him (by going to the end of the universe). Ends up immobilized for how long in ""the year(s?) that didn't happen"" by The Master. 
That is all i can remeber from Doctor Who so now Torchwood. (Where the really bad stuffs happened)[spoilers](#s ""Had his brother taken from him and then try to kill him (kinda did since he was stuffed in the ground repeatedly sufficating), watched his lover Ianto die, blown into pieces, had many co-workers die on him including Owen and Toshiko, watched the man he replaced commit suicide after ""mercy"" killing his team, sacrificed 12 orphans to aliens, had to kill his own grandson to make them go away the second time,"") and I haven't even seen past season four so that's all I know but I think Jack takes the entire cake on who has had it worst off.

Yes, you can find many many articles describing ""how terrible"" brazilian public health system is (SUS - sistema único de saúde). Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that overnight we decided to provide full health coverage for 180 million people.

Of course the system still has a long way to go, but you can't even begin to compare pre-SUS assistance with the level of health care you can get nowadays. We run one of the best HIV assistance programs in the world ans also a top organ-transplant program. The main reason for waiting times and over-crowding is simply that first line assistance spread fast, and now we have a choke point at the secondary and tertiary level. That is fixable with time, a sound health decision system based on cost-effectiveness analysis, and political interest.

Yes, corruption is bad here. Despite that, public system is way way more efficient than private. Efficiency is good use of resources; comparing waiting times at an ER at a public hospital and at one where every patient pays a load of cash just to breath the air has nothing to do with efficiency. 

Standard treatment for an MI costs the public health system anything from 200 to 800 reais. care to guess how much is costs for a health insurance company? For mine that would be over 10k. That's even higher than if I paid for it out-of-pocket.

Even though anytime the universe came into danger Rose would show up. and Martha (now with Mickey) would help out with some happenings.
However I do think Donna and Wilf are quite finished along with Rose but Martha and Jack should definitely show up again.

Bentley actually looked alright, given how much playing time he has had recently and his recent injury.  I don't know if I would keep him, but perhaps he turned a few heads.

true,oag721,smith,Smith,"So here's my analysis (apologize for it being long, but I think you will find it interesting):

They are my favorite because I originally came into the show because I'd heard about it on the Internet and I'm a huge time travel geek (it should all work like it does in ""The Big Bang"", save from the alterntae universe). This was last year. I watched BBC America's recap of series 5 and then watched ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and was hooked. To be honest, I loved the first half of series *because* it was complicated. I loved theorizing, I loved connecting the dots. I don't think I would have gotten into it with series 1-4, or even 5 (which I soon watched in between waiting for the new episodes). In fact, I used to sniff at the ""arcs"" in series 1-5 (although I like the structure of 5 muh more now) because they were so simple and didn't really build (although 5 did). I loved it because it was mad and ambitious and the characters were funny and they seemed like people you would want to hang out with. I also sort of have a personal connection with it. See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/xfsux/what_do_you_like_about_the_eleventh_doctor/c5m1eqx) for Smith's Doctor and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/xckpm/when_a_good_man_goes_to_war/c5ldosn) for Amy. I do think Amy and Rory have developed a lot. Amy is quite annoying in the first half of series 5 because she had a difficult childhood, but in series 6 she is much softer. Try watching it again and thinking about how the Doctor is her father figure at heart and how he always sees her as a little girl. And Rory is also a great guy to have around and he becomes a hero but is still caring. I'd say the two of them have come longer than Rose or Martha (I'm still pretty sure Martha would have left the TARDIS like she does in the finale much earlier if it wasn't a TV show), not to mention the classic companions who didn't have much story to them (most, at least). And also I really loved the Doctor's development in the last half of the series, which explored his self-loathing.

Okay, so I think there are flaws in series 6. I loved ""Let's Kill Hitler"", ""The Girl Who Waited"", and ""The God Complex"" (and even the finale), but the problem with the last half is that it is very stand-alone and not quite as addicting as the first half. This is a structure and probably a production issue. Coming with this problem that everyone always complains about: Amy apparently not being concerned about Melody being taken from her and whatnot. It's sort of a double-edged sword: if they took over the stand-alone episodes than fans would complain about the arc bleeding everywhere, but as they didn't the fans who wanted it to be more stand-alone did? This is also true of the finale. Killing the Doctor of course isn't going to happen so there isn't that much of a build-up, and while I liked the finale and the Teselecta twist, fans were complaining it was a cop-out. Well what did you expect, of course he wouldn't die! I think that it's much better if we don't know what's going to happen, and with us not knowing what might happen with the Silence and the Fall of the Eleventh (please don't regenerate yet, please!) for the next series/50th anniversary it is much more terrifying.

So finally, River. I think she's fun and wonderfully mysterious in ""The Time of Angels"" through ""Day of the Moon"" (and even her small part in ""A Good Man Goes to War""). I don't like her as much in ""Silence in the Library"" and ""The Wedding"" because she's kind of sappy/pining there. She's a little annoying in ""Let's Kill Hitler"", but that's not really her yet, and the story of how she becomes ""River"" in that episode (eventually sacrificing her future lives for him) is moving. I liked her being Amy and Rory's daughter because it all slotted in well and it's a bit of comedy with the Doctor being their son-in-law, and I really liked the revelation about her being part-Time Lord and thought it made sense. Radiation and whatnot. Anyway, so you were talking about them being in love...again I think we have the flaw of knowing what is going to happen again, like the astronaut. In the finale she just fills out her role as we knew she would. A lot of their relationship happens off-screen and I don't think that he's in love with her and I'm not sure why she's in love with him other than the fact they know it's going to happen (I guess there's a little with the end of ""Let's Kill Hitler"" and feeling remorse and what she had done, and in ""The Wedding"" she gives that speech which nicely wrapped the Doctor-is-disappointed-in-himself development). Based on ""A Good Man Goes to War"", I think the Doctor finds romance a sort of gleeful alien thing that he wants to explore like a child who gets a thrill out of doing something he shouldn't, and River is amused by that. The backwards meeting is quite a tragic thing, but of course it would be more powerful if they were more in love. The main reason I don't think they're in love is because I think the Doctor is asexual--yeah, I know, there's Rose (which was sweet) and Martha and Astrid (which was kind of annoying) who all fell for Ten, but Nine and Ten were more human Doctors (especially Ten) and Eleven is just more alien like a lot of the classic Doctors, which I really like. The problem is that love just doesn't gel, which is fine with me because we hopefully won't get any more characters who pine after him. You also have to understand that River's story was planned before Smith was cast, and while he is great and seemingly born for the role (have you seen him in interviews? I wonder if he's even acting sometimes), he wasn't exactly who they imagined.

Except for maybe a cameo to wrap up Amy and Rory's story I don't think River will be returning, so don't get too worked up over her, even if you want to see how she became badass. Do you want to have more backstory, or just move on with things? I sort of just want to move on and not have it taint the fun of the new series. That being said, I want a little more to how Amy and Rory are coping--they presumably don't have another child, as we see in the Christmas special.

So, maybe there were some misfires and I'd say it was an interesting experiment, but with the promise of series 7 being more stand-alone (and fun!) and a new companion who looks promising and different, don't give up yet! I agree that series 6 has flaws, but I perfer the characters in it than series 5, though I perfer the structure of that more. I hope this is balanced. I'm not really a critic and I tend to love everything, so while I loved it to death I can agree that things could have been done better differently.

He hit the ground running and was on top of his game from his first second on screen. I know Four's first episode turned me off because he was waaaay camp with the costume choices. One is kinda a jerk for several episodes. Three, Five, Eight and Ten are kinda off in la la land due to regeneration stuff. Six is just really abrasive (and homicidal) in his first appearance. I haven't seen Two's first episode. Seven is really slapstick for several episodes and I didn't care for that although later on he becomes one of my favorites.

true,Quazifuji,null,null,"It just varies by person.  The Doctor's a huge part of the show, and his lack of presence is probably the biggest downsite of Blink as an introuction.  But some people like Doctor Who for other reasons, like the endless entertaining sci-fi concepts and time travel.  Blink is great at showing off the show's interesting sci-fi concepts and uses of time travel.  It's also just good at showing off the quality of the show's writing at its best, which is important.  All Doctor Who fans love the Doctor, but he's not necessarily what gets everyone into the show initially.

In the end, I think Doctor Who appeals to different people for different reasons, and I think which episode is most likely to convince someone to watch the show depends on what aspect of the show you think they're most likely to be hooked on.  I think The Eleventh Hour, Blink, and Vincent - the three most common choices for episodes to convince people to watch the show - do a good job sort of covering all those different aspects between the three of them, while all being good episodes in their own right without depending on any knowledge of the show's characters or continuity to enjoy them (especially Blink and Eleventh Hour).  

Rose is a great introduction to the show and the Doctor, but I don't think it would be quite as great for convincing someone skeptical to watch it.  It was how the show was introduced to me, and I definitely enjoyed it, but it didn't blow me away and I was interested in the show already.  As I've said elsewhere in this thread, if a friend told me they wanted to get into Doctor Who and asked where to start, I'd tell them to start with Rose.

Where does it say that? Seriously I've had a brief read of the consititution and can't find any referance to that or healthcare anywhere. The closest it comes is in Article 1 Section 8 which states ""*The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States*"". Which would appear to contradict what your saying.

&gt;yes, the amount of people needing care will increase

How? this makes no sense! Unless your suggesting that somehow the provision of universal healthcare will dramaticaly increase the number of accidents, cancers, chronic illnesses and other medical conditions then what your saying is blatently false. People don't get sick or injured just becaue there's healthcare available, they get sick or injured regardless. What you are actually saying here is that a universal healthcare system will mean more people will seek treatment... think about that, because if thats true and if that's what you believe then it means that right now there's thousands of people who need care who aren't getting it.

I hate her little recurring phrases. 
I hate how she always has to one-up the Doctor.
I really don't like the idea of the Doctor having a relationship like he has with her. It just...doesn't seem right. To me, the Doctor should be a lone traveler in the long run, not tied down to some woman, especially when their time streams are all wonky. I mean, I love the Doctor, and I really don't want him to be lonely, but being lonely is part of the whole character. He's the last of his kind, that's the way it's *supposed to be*. It's in the fact that the Doctor goes through so many companions and makes so many friends that the show is so magical. That's what makes people want even more to be the Doctor's companion-because they feel like they *could*, since he takes so many people with him. 
I also hate how she thinks she's all that, when she really isn't. Don't get me wrong, she is quite beautiful, but I just feel like River as a character is acting like she is twenty and all the boys come to her yard. 
I also really don't like the way she was sort of thrown at us as an audience. River gets up there and is supposed to be looking all bad ass, and it just doesn't work for me. It seems to me like they're just spitting images at us saying, 'LOOK AT RIVER, SHE'S SUCH A BAD ASS, HUH?!', and we're supposed to clap like seals. 
There's also the fact that there's supposed to be do much love between the Doctor and River, *but they don't even spend that much time together*. I know we as an audience don't see a lot of it, but still. 
Finally, I hate how flirty they are. It's just really annoying. It's almost like they're flirting just *because* they know they will get married. However, upon rewatching season one, I love the flirtyness between Rose and Nine..so, you know.

true,nerdfighteriaisland,tardis,TARDIS,"I totally agree with you on River being forced. Their ""romance"" just comes out in random spurts, and they really don't ""mesh"" together well. Their flirting, particularly in Day of the Moon, is just horribly awkward to me. The only thing they have in common is time travel and regeneration, though now she's lost that. She also is, apparently, the only character allowed"" to use guns, and the Doctor is fine with, and even encourages it. 

Moffat's singular episodes were generally brilliant and stunning. I like him as a writer. I didn't particularly dislike Series 6, but the story arch was a bit of a shock to me. In the past, Doctor Who has sparingly had huge plots like that, the most prevalent probably being Bad Wolf, which was actually subtle until the end. It wasn't bad, but it did feel a little dragged out for such a small climax, and it would have been better if he used his talents for more of those amazing single episodes. 

I agree with the lack of character development, and it was such a big drop off from Donna's major change and how it really showed at the end after her memories were wiped, how much she had really been affected. I do have to say though, Amy had some moderate development in Series 5, with her relationship with both Rory and the Doctor. That was almost the whole point of the season, which bothered me a big, but no one else seems to see that, so I guess I'm just over-analysing. Rory also got much bolder as the episodes progressed, which I believe was shown a lot in A Good Man Goes to War, with the whole ""Shall I repeat the question?"" thing, which was frankly, bad ass in a way River Song could never meet. 

I'm not sure what I achieved with this comment, but it really feels good to express my opinions. My friends also support River Song, and I'm not exactly secretive about my hatred, but I definitely feel ostracised from them.

Eh, I think that's strong.  I think he's doing what he needs to do to force this move because if he does any less, Levy won't let him go.  Hell, he's done everything short of pull a Mascherano and it's *still* looking like Levy won't let him go.  After the window closed last season he was a top player for us and this is, after all, Real Fucking Madrid.  There just isn't a more prestigious club in the world.  *Anyone* they wanted would push for a move.  Maybe not this extremely, but then he's dealt with Daniel Levy before and knows half-measures won't hack it.

&gt; he won't take 2 mil under his already crazy high asking price

This isn't really the situation, and it's kind of misleading of the Mail to suggest it.  I would be willing to bet good money out of my own pocket that Levy would take 38 million straight cash if that was offered.  He's just not interested in anything but a straight cash deal.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Gylfi will be even better when we have a real striker and someone with mobility and energy behind him. He's not really had the chance this pre season to show off his final ball, but he's got that as well. 

His one big weakness is his lack of agility on the ball. He's mobile enough to press and he has a high work rate, but he lacks that little bit of class to wriggle out of tough situations like Rafa. 

Still, I think his other attributes more than make up for it. We caused more problems tonight from corners than we did for probably half of last season. And it only started happening when Bentley wasn't on the pitch pulling rank like a twat.

I hope that doesn't become a pattern, because it's not a stretch to say that Gylfi is already our best set piece specialist. He might not be as good a player overall as Bale or Rafa, but that one aspect of his game is probably better. 

Jan I think naturally has less noticeable impact as a CB but he was also very good business. Yeah the penalty was a bit sloppy but it's more down to the high line than a weakness as a player. I think maybe some people expected him to stride forward like Sauron and knock everyone back and score a goal each game, but I'm personally stoked to see him playing with more discipline for now. Hopefully we do see some of those adventures though as he gets acclimated to the game. His class is undeniable though, just needs some time to adjust.

You've no way of being certain who wrote the letter unless you saw them do it, but through careful investigation you could analyise the way they put sentances together, or their hand-writing (if its hand written), and get an expert witness to testify in court.

The same with twitter. So the guy could claim it wasn't him, but then the contnet of the message could be checked against his past history for signs of consistency in lanugage (spelling etc.). The logs from tiwtter could be accessed to see if any attempts had been made to guess his password. The sever records could be looked at to determine where the message came from and traced back through the service provider; if it came from a mobile device you should be able to determine whom, and if from a home computer owned by the suspect you might be able to determine if they were in the vacinity at the time.

Johnson at LB tends not to get forward so much, so he's not caught out defensively. Given that he's also improved as a defender in general this past season, he could be a good shout on an as-needed basis.

I wonder if Martin Kelly will get any time as a CB this season? He might fill in for Agger if the latter has to go to LB, although I'm not sure how further along he is compared to Coates, so perhaps not.

I'm not sure if you meant Coates at LB, but he doesn't have the pace. It'd end in tears, much like Skrtel at RB against Spurs. *shudder*",0,1343817788,null,0,false,0,c5micef,t3_xfxe3,t1_c5micef,t1_c5mh05y,null,1429523643,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

End of course assessments are not returned with comments and I've felt results are a bit random sometimes. In one case I got a distinction on the ongoing assessment, then failed the final assessment.

true,TheGreatCthulhu,null,null,"A few tips from many years as an OU student.

* The attrition rate is highest in the first year and first term, just like RL universities. Make it through the first year and the odds are high you will finish a degree.
* Take the long view. This race is endurance.
* Link courses for Certificates and Diplomas on the way to a degree. 
* Almost every course can be linked to two qualifications.
* Develop a dedicated study time immediately. 
* Friends/family who say they what you are doing is great will not be as supportive on a sunny summer Saturday afternoon. You are in this for you.
* Don't freak out about study time guidelines in Course Notes. Some courses you will fly through, some will take more. 
* Contact your tutors regularly.
* Learn your Personal Identifier or put it on your phone. You will often need it when away from home computer etc. 
* Sorry, not all the tutors are good.
* The Student Support Phone Centres are great. Add their number to your phone also.
* Go to the first tutorial on any new course even if it is not local.
* Plan to do ALL TMAs, every course, not to leave one out. Only use the TMA substitution rule for when disaster strikes which it inevitably will over a 4 or 5 year degree. Edit: Substitution rule has apparently changed. Do all the TMAs.
* CMAs can take LONGER than TMAs. 
* If you've been away from education buy &amp; read the OW Good Study Guide. Keep it. Follow it.
* For Social Sciences or ""softer"" studies when writing a Project or TMA essay: Say what you are going to say. Then say it. Then say what you said. Repeat as required. Then add a conclusion. Put nothing new in the conclusion. ALWAYS follow this plan.
* Even if you write TMAs better under pressure or think you need the deadline to get started... start a week early and pretend the deadline is a week earlier than it is. Just do it ok? This is single best thing I finally learned.
* Copy &amp; laminate the course calendar and put it on your fridge &amp; a copy with your books.
* There are some arseholes in MBA courses. If you don't think there are, then you're probably the arsehole to them.
* Think carefully if you can stand to waste time and money on an aborted MBA. Especially if you come from a Science background.
* Summer schools: Are you going to get laid or to study?
* Course books: keep them. Course notes and miscellanea: dump them.
* You are a mature student with life experience and hard won opinions. You don't have to convince the tutor you know more than them so sometimes it's better to stay quiet, play the game and go for the marks.
* Go to your Conferral even if you don't want to. You will NOT regret it. You don't have to go to the local one. I can recommend the Dublin &amp; Belfast ones.

Edit: For the Conferral, wear a t-shirt if you want but do get the robe. The person who decides not to go for the robe, regardless of choice of clothes, invariably regrets it.",0,1343819380,null,0,1343834996,0,c5mii1q,t3_xhr0w,t1_c5mii1q,t3_xhr0w,null,1429523716,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Jack (who was also one of Moffat's creations) was supposed to show up in ""A Good Man Goes to War"" but there was a scheduling conflict so it couldn't happen.  Might be just as well because he would have either stolen the show or been a complete let down.

Rose, Martha and Donna all appeared (very briefly) in ""Let's Kill Hitler"".

Pictures of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were featured in ""The Eleventh Hour"" which also opened with the Eleventh Doctor wearing the same clothes the Tenth Doctor was wearing in ""The End of Time"".

There is a reference to ""The Stolen Earth"" in ""Victory to the Daleks"" and ""Flesh and Stone"".  

""Flesh and Stone"" also alludes to ""The Next Doctor"".

In either ""The Rebel Flesh"" or ""The Almost People"" the Ganger Doctor goes through several catch phrases of past doctors including, ""Hello, I'm the Doctor"".

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; There's about as much evidence that Carroll will be leaving as there is that Reina is.

It is the clubs playing the media. I know how it works because I have been working in the field for 10 years. Evidence that the stories are true:

* Liverpool never came out and said outright that Carroll is not for sale. The response was always that it would be evaluated. 

* When the BBC first released the story it wasn't denied outright by Rodgers in the press conference that evening. If the BBC made that story up, it would be easy to deny.

* David Gold's son sent that tweet out

Evaluate all that evidence and compare it to what the media say and it all matches up. The same two journalists are breaking the new news. Everything on the record from PR is choicely worded (eg. deal not 'done').

I initially didn't believe the first BBC story either and I thought that they were misinterpreting what Rodgers said in his press conference. But they were spot on and had their own source.

The denials in Sky? I'll tell you how that works behind the scenes. The reporter at Sky reads the BBC story and decides that he needs to write about it now as well, but he doesn't want to credit the BBC because of competition between them. He picks up the phone and calls Liverpool's PR guy. The Liverpool PR guy gives a statement that the deal is not 'done'. Off the record they talk about where the deal really is and possibly strike a deal on leaking the next set of news. The Sky reporter then calls West Ham PR and gets the same thing. He then publishes a story that Liverpool and West Ham deny that the deal is **done** (it hasn't been done, if it were done it would already be public and filed with the FA and EPL). During this entire time the Liverpool PR person and the West Ham PR person are in contact. They each have their favorite reporters who they leak to to further the agenda of the club (in this case Liverpools agenda was to publicize that the deal was not yet completed and to get a competing bid).

If you don't believe the stories then you can sit on the sidelines and ignore them, but the clubs playing the media for their own benefit is exactly how this little world works.",0,1343822866,null,0,false,0,c5mivun,t3_xeyom,t1_c5mivun,t1_c5milgi,null,1429523897,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"I came to the OU after leaving the University of Leicester at the beginning of my third year there, where I had been studying for a BSc in geography. It was a combination of me realising I had made a mistake in opting to study a physical science for my first degree (I love science but I'd like to come back to it later as an interest, not as a career) and me being unhappy with the type of tuition and learning offered there, that compelled me to leave. I quite liked the city and the independence offered by living with friends, but it wasn't enough to make me stay and get a degree in a subject that I had lost interest in.

I enrolled in the OU last year and started a course in Evolution in February, but I have to say I really underestimated how much work it entailed, and had little idea how to schedule it around the job that I had just started. I pretty rapidly fell behind and I withdrew a month and a half ago, because I couldn't manage doing the TMAs on top of catching up on a backlog I had accrued when I was still fairly new to my job and had to focus on that.

Now that I'm happily settled back in at my parent's home and my hours are stable at work, I'm going to ease myself back into OU study with a 10-credit standalone module in digital photography (something I've always been interested in studying) followed by some environmental studies and sustainable design modules from the humanities side of geography, with a view to finally graduating in September 2013 with a BA Open Degree.

The OU is amazing and I do appreciate the shit out of it. I'm currently on a transitional fees arrangement and have avoided getting another £7000 of debt, which is nice, however I would still like to continue studying with the OU afterwards, probably for a BA in Design and Innovation, even though that will cost me £5000 a year rather than £1400 thanks to the new fees structure. Whether I continue learning after that is a decision I'm not ready to make, but I would love to continue studying some science, language and art modules. I meet lots of people on the shop floor who have studied with the OU for decades, well into their retirement, and think the world of it.

The LSE external page: http://www2.lse.ac.uk/study/UOLIP/home.aspx

For each degree there is a  'lead institution' the same as if you study in UoL as a regular student. For example, Heythrop college do philosophy and divinity,
Royal Vetinary College to vet/health stuff, LSE do economics and politics related stuff.

Would reccomend, you get online lectures and help with everything and it is examined to the same standard as 'regular' students. There is an online group where you can find other people doing your course. With this it helps to be doing a degree that other people are doing. Universities seem to consider it kosher. You do have to work hard though. 

Personally, I think that this is the future. why pay 9K a year plus accommodation for a degree when you can get one for 1.5K a year? A MIT professor ( I forget who ) who is working on a Harvard/MIT online learning centre has stated that online learning will be the biggest revolution in education since the development of the printing press. 

It is also pretty economical to when you think about it. There is not point having 1000, say economics lecturers around the world giving the same classes every year, when you could just get the best professor to record it and let people view it online every year ( the basic stuff never really changes ).

I have a disability so this is the only way that I could study at LSE (I had an offer for a regular place but was too ill to go). Now I get an LSE degree without leaving the house!

For those that don't know this show, it's fascinating. Sapphire (Lumley) and Steel (McCallum) are supernatural beings (somehow representing the elements they are named after) who are hunting down Time, and the adverse affects of Time breaking down.

If that sounds vague, it's because it is. The best thing about Sapphire &amp; Steel is that it resolutely refuses to explain itself. There are few answers, just more questions. We don't know what Sapphire and Steel are really doing, who they are working for, just that they fight ghost-like apparitions of time.

Secondly, this was made as a cheap summer replacement show. Each multi-episode story takes place on just one or two sets, with small casts and few special effects.

No one can blame him, really, but at the same time, why would AVB play a player who's already decided he won't be here next year when he can play any other of our talented youngsters who can develop and still play for Spurs in 3 or 4 years?

Part of the point in using a different energy interchange medium is to _allow_ for reduced fossil fuel involvement, surely?  Otherwise we'd just use petrol!

So taking a long term view, syngas can be produced elsewhere than fossil fuels; and there other options.  All of these look better than direct electrolysis - which is the only non-fossil fuel options for hydrogen that I've seen proven to work on an industrial scale.

There are some advantages to hydrogen, but all the disadvantages seem to be being swept away, rather than a balanced consideration across options.

true,orbiting,uk,United Kingdom,"It's shoddy at best. Where the hell does 15 come from? Is 20,000 a flow or a stock quantity? And what proportion of the total number of Muslim couples is this?

There are plenty of more egregious abuses to be found. Literally every sentence in this article is an affront to journalism.

&gt; *""Muslim men, who often have up to four wives (and in some instances five or more) in a harem.""*

Often? How often? This is BS, unless they've specifically used ""up to"" in order to include monogamous unions too (in which case the only people they aren't counting are single).

&gt; *""The rapid growth in multiple marriages is being fuelled by multicultural policies that grant special rights to Muslim immigrants, who demand that Sharia law be reflected in British law and the social welfare benefits system.""*

This is someone's opinion presented as the actual state of affairs.

&gt; *""The multiple marriages have been encouraged by changes made to the British welfare system by the previous Labour government, which allowed Muslim immigrants to have a second, third or fourth wife (and in some cases five or more) treated as a single mother who can get a house and an array of other state payments for herself and her children.""*

First, this is written hysterically. Second, it makes no sense. If the woman gets exactly what she would get as a single parent then how is it ""encouraging multiple marriages""? She's no better off than if she was unmarried. It might encourage fertility and lone parenthood, but the system as a whole does that -- it's nothing to do with Muslims specifically.
&gt; *""The exposé shows how Muslim men can take a new spouse from anywhere in the world, father any number of children with her, and have British taxpayers assume responsibility for this family's upkeep and care.""*

So? I can walk down the street with a gun and shoot a bunch of people. I haven't, but I could. Where's the outcry about the millions of other awful things people can potentially do? Just thinking about the amount of hypothetical crime that could hypothetically be committed is far more horrifying than this.

&gt; *""Muslim men also cheat the system by bringing brides from abroad as nannies for their children, or as nurses for a sick relative. After the bride's one year visitors' visa expires, she then disappears into a tight-knit local Muslim community and is then entitled to receive welfare handouts. Apart from the ""nanny ruse,"" new female partners enter the country using tourist visas, student visas or work permits. They simply overstay the visas, which are normally for six months, and then remain in Britain, often hiding away in their husband's home.""*

Based on... what? Also, this is about outstaying one's visa -- a completely separate issue. Or is it only Muslims who do that?

&gt; *""The result is that the more children produced by Muslim polygamists, the more state welfare money pours in for their wives and them. By having a string of wives living in separate homes, thousands of Muslim immigrants are squeezing tens of millions of British pounds from the state by claiming benefits intended for single mothers and their children.""*

But being married doesn't increase the total amount of benefits paid out. These people could get just as much (if not more) if they weren't married. Also, ""thousands"" of people ""squeezing tens of millions"" out of an £88 billion welfare budget? Really desperate stuff here.

&gt; *""Those women are eligible for full housing benefits – which reach £106,000 ($250,000) a year in some parts of London...""*

Which part of London is that? Kensington and Chelsea? Hammersmith and Fulham? And how many Muslim families live there?

&gt; *""...and child benefits paid at £1,000 ($1,500) a year for a first child, and nearly £700 ($1,000) for each subsequent one.*

Newsflash: *everyone* with a child is eligible for this. Your marital status, ethnicity and religion are all irrelevant. Again, desperate stuff.

Then you have a few paragraphs lifting some anecdotes from an ""exposé"". While we're at it, I've lived here all my life and have never met a single polygamous family, so I could write a report tomorrow stating that there is no polygamy based on my own experiences. It would be no more or less valid than the source they quote.

The best way I can think to describe it is if you had a bunch of angels all lined up in a row. They'd all be quantum locked except the one in the back, and as soon as that one moved/stopped looking at the one in front of it, that one would be unlocked, and so on.

These are a large group of creatures that are very much aware of their 'disability', and they're going to move accordingly. Basically put, they know what they're doing, what their limitations are(Such as their scope of view), etc. The Angels were never all looking directly at one another like they were in Blink, and even if this did occur they'd still probably know ways to stop it with such large numbers. If two were staring at one another then it would still be easy for a third to stand in between them, blocking the other from view, and unlocking the two. The two move, the third becomes unlocked, and there you go.

It's far too narrow for Premier League, which has more wingers than Serie A (the main place the 4-3-1-2 is used), and is played at a higher-tempo which allows for more counter-attacks, something the 4-3-1-2 is susceptible to because of how empty the flanks are. It's also too narrow for us, considering that many teams will be playing defensively and on the counter-attack against us and we want to be stretching the play. Also puts all the creative onus on the AM, say Gerrard - teams just have to shut him down to significantly reduce the formation's threat. 

It could have some advantages - Gerrard stays upfront, Enrique and Johnson have license to get forward, Suarez/Borini work the channels while Carroll stays central as a reference point.

George Boyd would be a good signing. There is one significant question mark over him, however, and that is regarding why he can only seem to play well in League One. He tore us apart in the 08/09 season, then failed in the Championship with both a crumbling Peterborough side and a Nottingham Forest side that didn't look any better with him on loan (they had a view to signing him permanently and didn't take him).

In fact, it's almost as if 'The Left' is not a homogeneous monolith which issues pronouncements on that which is and is not verboten.

I remember having had many conversations with friends about how ghastly the modern Olympic sponsorship free for all is, and queried the need for maybe quite such overbearing and jumpy security (much of it beuniformed).  I watched the Olympic torch go past and shuddered as the majority of the procession was taken up with smiling policemen hi fiving crowd members and garish corporate party buses filled with the smiling Ubermensch hired from central casting.

This isn't enough for me to 100% rule out him coming, but it's enough that I think people should stop talking about him like he's nearly definite.


I say this next part with full knowledge that most everyone will disagree with me, but I think we still have the talent to succeed within the club.

Kane still has the potential to become a real threat, he just needs a few games under his belt in the PL.

Townsend is a very real threat already, and I think given a full 90 he could cause the other team a lot of problems, if not score himself.

Bale I believe, despite general consensus, has the ability to lead the line given a few more games in the position.

Carroll has the ability to replace Modric. Once again it's a matter of giving him minutes so he can adapt.

I have faith Gio will buy into and, more importantly, fit into the AVB revolution, and I think this could be massive for us.

Again, I fully expect to be mauled for this, but it's my opinion, as requested.

Edit: extra character
Edit2:With Moving Bale to striker, I say half a game with either Gio or Townsend out left to start, then sub out LW and shift Bale over, replacing with Kane, until someone starts scoring goals.

Kane does look promising but he's gonna see a lot of the bench, and there's no way he can start the season as our 2nd choice striker. Hopefully we can bring him on in smaller games and get him some prem experience to slowly ease him in.

Townsend looks quality, as does Livermore, I think we're going to struggle to keep both of them if they keep impressing - especially if we sign a new midfielder.

Carroll can't walk in to our first team and replace Modric, he doesn't have the experience and the jump from playing Leyton Orient and Derby to a top 4 Premier League club is insane. He does have potential though, similar situation to Kane. Plus he is way down the pecking order when we have Huddlestone, Livermore, Sandro, Parker, even Jenas is more likely to start games.

What i have been holding out hope of is letting AVB and the team get back from the US tour.  I am hoping AVB wanted to take some time to evaluate the team thoroughly and then make decisions on the personnel he has.  

Remember he had what?...a week, 10 days to work with the players before the tour? From what i have seen and read of his personality 10 days is a small window for him to complete these assesments. So i have been hoping that the full month of July to work with the players and begin putting in his system will allow him to see who would and wouldn't work in the system.

Now we have August 1, team is heading home and more importantly so is Levy.  I would hope they have been marking out transfer targets and now can get down to serious business. I am hoping for a resolution to Modders and Ade and a couple moves to strenghthen the team.

I think we can survive without picking up a direct replacement for Modders right away. It will make it tougher but in AVB's system Gylfi, VDV, Thud, Parker, Sandro should be able to make it work.  Adding a player like Dembele would make it easier, Moutinho would be ideal but i have a feeling that will turn into a haggling war between Porto and Levy.  

Personally i can't tell if Damiao is a realistic target or not, clearly we have made it known that we want him but we seem to keep bidding just below what Inter want and get rejected and haven't seemed to resubmit. Damiao seems happy-ish there, their owner made the ""we want him here forever"" comment which all seems to point to him not moving....But i thought the owner made a similar statement about Oscar and then sold him. So i don't know if it is a no go or gamemanship. I think Rondon is the cheaper, easier and potentially safer move at striker. 

Of course we could have a trick up our sleeve and pull a Llorrente, Hulk, Falcao move out of our ass, i don't think we will but i would love to see it.  I would settle for getting Ade, Rondon and another young and cheap striker (Castignos maybe?).

I think the final move i would want to see is actually for Lloris, it seems to have gone cold and at first i wasn't a huge fan of the deal. We don't desperately need him, he doesn't score goals or play on the wing...But, it seems to be one of those moves where a world class player is available at a reasonable price....well sometimes you just have to take the gamble and see if you can land them.",0,1343838310,null,0,false,0,c5mm3qq,t3_xib8k,t1_c5mm3qq,t3_xib8k,null,1429525475,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

Well you'll be glad to know that we don't have any characters that like in Glasgow. We have 'neds' in some poorer areas, but they're just puppy dogs that bark too loud for the most part.

There's 5 general areas of Glasgow for residence, the city, north, east, west and south.

City: a bit of everything can be expected if you live in the city, mostly noise and commuters/shoppers will be swarming the area. However the city is really affordable and you're within walking distance of everything you can hope for.

North: Mostly just residential areas. There's nothing of interest here other than houses, farms and small grocery stores. It's affordable, but you might get cabin fever up there.

East: Generally the poorer part of Glasgow, and as such crime rates and people you want to avoid are higher in this part. Living here is the cheapest, though, but you get what you pay for.

South: Where I live, this is an old part of the Glasgow area with a strong historic influence. Buildings here look a bit fancier, and it's mostly small business owners or professionals that live here (teachers, doctors, web devs like me).
The area is pretty affordable for Glasgow. Typically around £500-550 per month for a two bedroom property. I don't know how this measures up in the states, but for the UK, its a sweet deal.

West: Mostly students and professionals live here Glasgow University is in the West and a lot of cultural buildings (eg museums). Costs are very high in the West, and since you would live mostly amongst students with rich parents, don't expect to have a quiet night's rest. Typically a one bedroom property is around £600 per month, so you're not getting your money's worth.

We are lost without that tempo setter and deep-lying energy. Then again, we're also lost without one of our ball-winners so we never really remotely saw the potential of our midfield.

To me, everything has sort of conspired to make this more of a transitional year. If you wanted to install a new manager, the worst time to do so would probably be during a summer with two major tournaments to disrupt business and training. And that's saying nothing about Levy's personal life issues. 

I just hope we give AVB more than one season. I think Arsenal or Chelsea will have to underachieve massively for us to break into the top 4 this season, no matter who we realistically sign. Last year really was our best chance for 3rd, and we are going to pay some sort of price for it. 

I think maybe it's going to be a case of taking a few steps back this season but then hopefully getting more settled after that. I just hope everything doesn't go to shit if we finish 6th or something.

As far as Carroll and Dos Santos, agreed 100%. Carroll needs to hit the gym or something, he has the brains for it, but he's tiny. Modric was deceptively strong and could dribble his way out of just about anything, and Carroll doesn't quite have that talent yet.

That hope is slowly dying. We're looking more and more likely to still be scanning the news expectantly on transfer deadline day.

We're not down and out yet though; we can get over a slow start if it happens, and we *will* sign more players; it's just a shame it hasn't happened already. I'm just as worried about the players leaving to be honest - I could just about have taken Vertonghen and Gylfi being our only signings at this point if we'd sold Modric, Dos Santos, Bassong, Jenas and Bentley already.

I'm still less worried about the playmaker role than everyone else seems to be. I think VdV will play deeper this year and take on a lot of Modric's responsibilities in that respect (not to say he'll take the same role), and Huddlestone is going to keep getting better as he keeps getting fitter.

Arsenal and Chelsea have certainly strengthened, but in losing Drogba and RVP (assuming assuming...) they've both also got some big difficulties to overcome - you don't get over losing players like that easily. People putting Chelsea into the title race after signing Hazard are jumping the gun - I still think Di Matteo won't last the season. While Cazorla and Giroud should be great for Arsenal, Podolski's been consistently overrated because of international form that has rarely been reflected domestically, and they're still going to be relying a lot on some historically injury prone players staying fit.

The first meeting I went to (last September), I listened to an 8th Doctor radiodrama, having never seen the show. Later that day, I watched Blink. Every Monday at 7pm, I watched with my friends a new who episode followed by an old who of the group's head's choosing. I have now seen all episodes 8-11, and a goodly number of old serials.
I don't like 9 particularly,  and consciously avoided him for a long time. 5 is my favorite older Doctor, though that infernal celery still pisses me off! I prefer newer episodes for aesthetic reasons, as well as (I feel) better storylines.
Recently, I forced myself to watch the end of 9, and felt a good amount of sympathy for him; I was caught by surprise at this, as I feel he is a genocidal maniac. (The Time War takes a lot out of a man, I guess!) Regardless,  I watched him.
A fan is whomever declares oneself a fan. I am a fanatic, and will not disqualify others because I feel their reasoning is not sound, or of superficialities; I have only been a Whovian for a year; how could I be a /real/ fan to those who watched from 1 till today?!?

They actually try to get you *stationed* together, but chances are you won't be working in the same squadron/unit/platoon.

http://usmilitary.about.com/od/familydomestic/a/militarycouples.htm

So, when I'm done with basic and my schooling, it's a decent chance that I will be stationed on the Naval Air Station that my husband, daughter, and I already live at. He's in a squadron, and I will be in a different one. If there are no open slots for my job when I'm done with career school (unlikely) they will try to place me at a base nearby. I'm enlisting under the same rating umbrella my husband did. AV - He ended up as an AT(O), and I might end up AT(I) or AE, but that's still planes... which is what our base revolves around.

The military is already paying for an apartment for us. They won't want to have us have an apartment AND station me far enough away that they'll be filling a barracks room with my butt. They'd rather I be close to my spouse and daughter because it's cheaper and more efficient.

Not to mention the fact that military families who are stationed further apart tend to leave the military faster, no matter how good they are at their jobs or how happy they are otherwise. People don't like being away from their spouse and kid when they have the chance to be with them, especially when military families already have deployments to contend with.

So, they wouldn't be likely to be DEPLOYED together. Unless it's a situation where there MOS/rate is very specific and they're needed overseas... Even then, one cannot be directly in charge of the other in their command chain.

true,Chickpea123uk,english,England,"I'm an OU lecturer on two courses - one in psychology and one in sociology. Both are level 2 (equivalent to 2nd year of a 3 year degree. And both are 60 points (one sixth of a whole degree). 

I did my first degree at a bricks-and-mortar university, then after working for a few years started a new degree with OU. After I completed that I did an MSc with the OU. So I am familiar with traditional and distance learning study, and I know both sides of the OU experience - teaching and learning. 

The level of ability you have to reach and stuff you have to know are exactly the same at the OU as any other British uni because there is a governing body for institutions that grant degrees. But we don't have any academic requirements for students to start studying. You don't need 3 A'levels. You don't need any qualifications at all. You just need the cash. 

Therefore Level 1 courses assume a very low level of ability, and the main point of them is to haul you up to Level 2 standard. A lot of people drop out as they realise they don't have what it takes, or they have too many other commitments, or they just don't want it as much as they thought, or whatever. 

You'll notice a HUGE learning curve between Level 1 and Level 2. By now you should be operating like any other 2nd year uni student. At Level 3 there is another jump. There always is - 3rd year uni study is hard. If it wasn't there wouldn't be any point. 

You will need a lot of study skills and organisational skills to get an OU degree whilst also trying to live a life. Most OU students fit their study around full time jobs, family life, parenthood etc.  It takes at least 6 years to get a degree this way. In any 6 year period of a normal person's life, there are going to be some major crises and shit. I've taught students who were diagnosed with cancer, who got married, bereaved, gave birth, moved jobs, moved house. I love my students and I'm in awe of their dedication and effort. I'll do anything to help them achieve their dreams (except turn a blind eye to plagiarism). 

In my experience the teaching materials are the dog's gonads. The books and DVDs and other materials are absolutely top-notch. I found the quality of teaching far higher at OU than at traditional uni, by which I mean the books and videos. That's the main way you learn with OU. Your tutor's role is not mainly to teach you. They're there to mark your assignments, give face to face tutorials once a month (more in Level 1 where you get much more handholding), and support you by phone and email when you need it. The quality of tutor's is variable. Most are fine, some are outstanding but a few suck. Fortunately a sucky tutor normally isn't make-or-break because you mostly teach yourself, and you can usually change tutor if you ask. 

I'm worried about the few rises. As I said, I love my mature students. They make my job rock (it sure isn't the pay). I'm afraid that mature students will be priced out of OU degrees, and instead we'll get lots of 18 year old who see it as a cheaper alternative to going away to a regular uni. I've got nothing against 18 year olds, but I'll miss my mature students and I feel bad for them losing the wonderful opportunity to change their life.

Rondon's still a risk, but less of one than Damaio I think. AVB's reportedly not keen on Remy, but that doesn't make him a bigger risk than Damaio. Gignac's not got on well since he joined Marseille, but I still like him and Marseille are not in the best position right now.

Lyon supposedly need money and have missed out on CL; if we could get either of Lopez or Gomis I'd be ecstatic. Aubameyang has also looked decent at St Etienne.

Levante are apparently still keen to cash in on Kone. Sevilla are well out of things this year - Negredo could easily be available. Soldado is probably shooting too high, but I think Valencia are yet to bring in the annual large transfer fee that keeps them in business so you never know. We've all heard plenty about Adrian too.

And that's without pointing out that none of us thought VdV was realistic until we signed him - there are a lot of others I'm leaving out here that are only borderline unrealistic.

I'm not saying I'd have all of those players above Damaio, but in the context of making a single signing before the window closes I think all would be less risky options.

edit: If we get Adebayor as well, I'd take Damiao over a lot of the above because the potential reward is so high with him. Just don't want to rely on him coming good immediately.",0,1343844268,null,0,1343845635,0,c5mnvc5,t3_xi1qn,t1_c5mnvc5,t1_c5mm5zr,null,1429526307,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Unfortunately you do need money to have kids in the world we have created, at least in this country. They cost a shit tonne as you have alluded to and its sad but to an extent yes. If people can't afford kids I don't know if government should step in. I'm not totally against it, my opinion is fluid but the crap fact of the matter is that if you are born into a rich home you are likely to do much, much better than a kid from a poor home. better at least in silly westernised terms anyway. 

The difference between being able to provide a good life or not for children will likely never be breached by government subsidies, or at least not unless they increase dramatically. The reason I don't expect to have children is because I don't believe I will be able to give them the quality of life I would want to give them, but that is just my own view, although one echoed by a number of people I know. I wish it wasn't like this but it is. I'm fully supportive of benefits to support children and the welfare state, I work for a charity that helps poor people mainly, i'm not a horrible person.

It makes sense to stop using the limited spectrum for Freeview, yes. However it does not make much sense to then move this to the internet, which is not a broadcast medium and there is many bandwidth restraints (although ISP caching at something like the cabinet-level could resolve this).

It makes a lot more sense, to move it to Freesat.

Look at it this way.
Freeview HD is shifts between 0.8 - 1.2Megabytes (depending on framerate) per SECOND for a single channel. None of this high compression iPlayer shit either. Decent MPEG4.
...that would require at least a 9.6megabit line (so decent ADSL2 users, VM or Fibre only).

Sure, your connection may well support that, but could your ISP really support delivering that to almost all of their subscriber base, all the time? If you are silly enough to have a bandwidth cap, how many hours does 4GB an hour take to bust it? What if you want more than one TV on different channels?

It is of course, the future for on-demand. But to replace channel broadcasting is a non-starter.

consider this. Most people can name at most 7 olympians in London right now. Of all the Olympians I'd hazard that at most only 70 are even close to house hold names in their country of origin. Of those half have achieved that fame because they're female and have appeared in a photoshoot in the past few years. 

You can look up on your own how many athletes are involved in London right now. The vast majority have regular jobs and don't get paid very much at all and will returning to their day jobs after the sport is over. Of all of that it's estimated that we catch maybe half the dopers and yet the level of testing and enforcement is massive. There is literally no other subset of international sport you could have picked with more scrutiny and standards than pretty much....

**Garibaldi:**

Named after a 19th century Italian general, this biscuit is also known as the ’flies graveyard’ after it’s squashed currant construction. You can tear off portions from a strip of Garibaldi so good for periods when biscuits have been rationed. Recommended for survivalists and prisoners.

**Ginger Nut:**

The Royal Marine Commando of biscuits. Able to sustain severe dunking. Hard as nails. Also my personal favourite for it’s mild spicy bite.

**Hob Nob:**

Oatie favourite, a sort of flapjack/digestive biscuit hybrid. Genetically engineered to be dunked into tea. Very tasty too. Provides roughage for old people and rusks for babies so it cuts right through the generation gap in terms of it’s utility.

**Nice:**

The debate rages on how to pronounce this biscuit. Is it like the French city? Is it prounced like ""nice to see you"" or what?

**Jammy Dodgers:**

Childhood favourite, you can pull the two sandwich portions apart or just dunk the thing. Looks a bit rude. Overall a bit too sweet for my liking though.

**Rich Tea:**

This is a very understated biscuit and actually very classy. It’s minimalist in construction, and cheaper brands can be a bit like cardboard but those who know about biscuits will tell you it’s a good all rounder.

**Party Rings:**

Other than at a five year old’s birthday party, anybody who has these biscuits should be pistol whipped and have their human rights taken away from them.",0,1343848900,null,0,false,0,c5mp9zz,t3_xifn0,t1_c5mp9zz,t3_xifn0,null,1429526970,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The centre and west end are lovely, the Southside is a bit of a mixed bag but cheap, and don't go anywhere near the East end unless you have to (you likely won't have to). Glasgow has particularly bad weather even by UK standards, so expect wind, rain, grey skies throughout the year and long nights in the winter.

Similar places to look at would be Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol etc assuming that city living is important to you and you don't fancy paying a premium for London. If you can afford to, come over and spend a few days in each, and decide for yourself. Like anywhere, all of these places have their places to avoid. Huge sprawling dilapidated council estates (our equivalent 'Projects' in the US) should be treated with comparable caution to their US equivalents, they might be a bit safer due to gun control, but they won't be that much more fun to live in. 

All the cities I mentioned have very good Universities if you fancy doing a Masters over here. Would be a good start- getting a job visa could be difficult depending on your skills, as our Conservative government seems to think that putting draconian limits on Non EU immigration is a vote winner, and don't seem to mind that it is completely pointless.

If you can't get a Visa to move here and don't fancy continuing your education, or even if you want to see the sun for more than 2 weeks of the year, give some thought to Australia and New Zealand aswell, as they are reputedly much more welcoming on the Visa front.

true,deadgreystar,null,null,"Jeez, I was offered the choice of using myworldofwork.co.uk or going on a CV course by my Jobcentre a few weeks ago. The second the advisor said ""2 day course"" I took the DIY option for creating a CV, looks like I made the right decision especially now I've got a job.

JSA is something I took because it was available to me and I had no other income (although I live at home so it was basically beer money) so I got a few hundred pounds out of it. However when I went to the JC to see about claiming they said they didn't handle the claims, so I filled out an online form. Then I had to go to the JC to get the claim checked over :\, then wait for two weeks for any form of information to appear (and this was close to the second time I signed on) and the money turned up almost 4 weeks to the day I claimed. Then I was told to fill out a form each time I did something that was looking for work related - but 'you don't actually have to apply, we can't check that' was the gem of advice given. 

Then I had to meet an advisor on a day other than my signing on day for basically the same shite as normal. Then I had to rearrange an appointment because of a funeral I had to attend and was given a new time on a different day. When I turned up the person that was handling the signing on (because the advisor decided to take a month off) gave me the third degree because his idiotic colleague didn't offer me a time on the same day but earlier (even though I had to leave at 6am to travel to the funeral and got back at 8 at night) 'because that's the usual procedure'. They then put it down as a 'domestic emergency' and after you accrue two or more then they investigate you. Then when I went back the time after that the person that signed me on (advisor was still a week away from being back at work) didn't even check the form I had filed out diligently. Luckily I got a job offer the following week but I'd seriously consider not going back on JSA because it's so much hassle to get £52 a week, and it takes so long to actually receive any money, and one person that doesn't do their job can seriously jeopardise your claim. 

My favourite part was the last time I signed on I told the advisor (who magically turned up for once) about the offer and asked what to do. I had been given a form at the start of the process to fill out and hand to the advisor when I got work, but she told me they don't handle closing of claims there either... She told me to phone up a number to do that, and when I did I got told not to phone them after 4 'because we're too busy' even though I got straight through. I was also told you can only close the claim a week prior to the start date and to phone closer to the date. Every step of the way there was incompetency, lack of information, people doing their jobs poorly and open contempt for the jobseekers.

true,GypsieGenie,EN,england,"Here's Ron Gourlay talking about potential transfers.

You mentioned the team's performances earlier. Where is improvement needed before we kick off the campaign?
It's a question better aimed at Robbie, but we need to understand that this is pre-season training and we have been getting ourselves ready against teams who are midway through their seasons in Seattle Sounders and the MLS All-Stars, whereas we are just getting there.
We've had players filtering back into the team, some guys have been with the squad a few days, others only just over a week, so it is very difficult to get things right immediately. People expect us to win every game we play, but it can't always be like that, and in pre-season we have other measures, such as the intensity of training which has been very, very good.
Results will come, of course the fans always like to see us win, even in pre-season, but more important is that we are ready for the Community Shield and the start of the Barclays Premier League a week later when we play Wigan.
And finally, what is the latest news on the transfer front?
The situation is that we are still looking to potentially strengthen the side. The manager feels there are maybe one or two areas where we may need to strengthen but that will only happen if we find the right personnel to bring in.
We are already very strong and have a big squad, but if we feel there are players out there who can strengthen the side in the right position, we will continue to do so but it has to be the right player at the right cost, because both these things are very important. However, if we have to go with the pool we have now then we are in a very strong position going into the season.

But if we take anything from it, if you're a cyclist (be that avoid rider or casual commuter), give all large vehicles a wide berth.  Don't go down the side, don't try to get in front, just hang back.  Treat them like they're elephants and you're a mouse.

Smart cycling isn't about getting in front all the time.  It's about knowing the flow of traffic, knowing when to hang back, knowing where you're going to bunch up again in the future (lights, round abouts, crossings).

true,treebox,null,null,"I think it's because Ch4 news offers an in depth look at UK and world affairs over the course of an hour, with more time for interviews and finer details. The BBC has a local broadcasting mandate to fulfill so they have to devote 30 minutes to UK and international stories and then the other half to local news. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just when you live in Northern Ireland you get completely sick of hearing some of the news in the local slot. Ch4 news positions itself a bit later too at 7pm which might make it more appealing to a different audience or age group. I really don't know but I'd love to see if there were any figures on who watches it to see what 'kind' of person does.

I don't have any problem with the BBC's coverage, it still remains the core of British and worldwide journalism as a reliable, if not sometimes a little boring, standard by which other organisations are inevitably measured. The existence of the BBC pleases me and I hope it continues decades into the future. I just appreciate that Channel 4 have noticed that they can be different in the sense of when they can put their news on (7pm slot) and how they devote their time on air to more specific journalism. I think it's quite innovative, and worth watching if not for anything else but to see what colour Jon Snow's socks and tie is.

Edit: your comment on rocking the boat was something I missed but you're completely right. I know that in the Iraq War run up they completely refused to be complicit with the government's line without at least questioning it. That's journalistic integrity, I don't see Al Jazeera going against the Qatari government in the same way for example. That Radio 4 journalist who spoke against the reliability of the September Dossier had some serious balls, and it made me happy that he did it. The BBC gets a bad rap around some parts of the world for being the British government's mouthpiece, which to some extent it actually is when you consider the eyes the world service reporting is framed through. You wouldn't expect anything less, the journalists are British after all. I think the BBC News reaction to the dossier (which let's face it, in the end was dodgier than Delboy) was justified and right. Hopefully it showed the world the BBC can be independent even when funded by the government.

July 21, 1937

To whom it may concern,
	

My name is Alfrons Boehm, and I am writing a letter of complaint. I doubt anything will be done to rectify my complain in the time I have left, but if there is anything an old man has the right to, it is the occasional grumbling. 


I am ninety eight, and my life is coming to it’s end, I can tell. I do not mind that, I am the longest lived man in my family, and it has been a good life. My children are successful, and I have lived to see my grandchildren. What I do mind, is that I will not be allowed to die in my family home in Ettersberg. My father died there, and his father, and his father, back and back in the generations to my great, great, great, great grandfather, who built this farm. It would have brought me peace to have died in the same place, the old secluded farm house that I have not left for years now. 

	
Instead, some government types came, and insisted on buying my property. Could you not have waited a month for an old man to pass on? I admit I am too old, and too tired to keep up with the goings on of the younger generation, but I was told a prison camp was to be built on mine, and the surrounding properties. I believe I should serve my country, and would have granted the land in my will, but instead I have been forced to move in with my daughter. This irritates me, as it is not fair for her family to suddenly make room for me, a man who will leave as soon as he arrived.


I write on the slim chance that my home has not yet been torn down, and I may return there, before construction starts. I am annoyed about how this was handled, but as the transaction was legal, all I can do is write, and request a chance to die in my home.


Sincerely,
Alfrons Boehm

Look, the guy is world class, one of the best talents in the world today, and I wouldn't trade him for anyone.  It's because he's so good that I'll accept his behavior.  You bet if Konchesky acted like this we'd lay into him.  There's nothing wrong with loving a player who's got this dark side.  We don't have to trick ourselves into thinking that he's not a bit of a brat by cherry picking statistics.  He plays for a club that draws the ire of many people, so they'll latch onto anything they can get to beat him with, and no amount of arguing will change that.  If Rooney had been accused of what he has, we'd all go to town.

If articles like this help you feel better about cheering for him then fine, that's your thing, but all other clubs' fans will laugh in your face if you try to bring it up because they don't care.

He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there, forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that’s her. That’s always her. As for me, I was suspended in time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their protector. We wanted to live forever. So the Doctor made sure we did.

My complaints with him are chiefly that his performance lacks the soul - the passionate heartfelt responses that other actors have successfully imbued the character with, and an uncomfortable detachment and lack of understanding he seems to have with both his current surroundings and with the previous 900 years of his life. The last one I know is the writers fault, but it irks me that he runs around like he has autism instead of being the astute observer and assimilator of culture and other beings that make him the ultimate traveller. I haven't seen the classics since I was a kid so I have to go back and compare more thoroughly - but I don't remember the Doctor ever looking at people with this level of bewilderment, or being so completely oblivious to every social cue any creature shows him.

Like they meet her at 25 and she has these interesting moves and then meet her at 21 and end up accidentally showing her things that they saw her do later on in her life. 

Her character is the major flaw. 

Her timeline is a minor one but I've already decided I don't like her and chose to move on and see if their was anything at all that I liked about her. Nothing really appeals and this minor flaw is something I think if it was fixed would have made her have one thing that I would think was interesting.

50 years ago, in 1965 Star Trek decimated the norm by featuring a multi-racial bridge crew which included a vulcan-human hybrid, a Japanese man (think WWII), a Russian (think Cold War) and a black woman (think women's rights and African-American rights). Most notably, William Shattner and Nichelle Nichelle Nichols share a kiss on screen.

The thing about Star Trek was it was never a big deal. There were no chips on the shoulder, no witty jokes, they interacted as a group of people who respected one another as human beings. The culture shock was in the delivery; it wasn't a big deal.

I love Dr. Who, but the qwip here and the little jokes about The Doctor and Craig in season 6 were shallow and overly scripted, and they felt like they were written in to meet some sort of inclusion quota.

true,Imagicka,tardis,TARDIS,"Wow, I couldn't disagree with you more.  I love Moffat as a showrunner.  The story arcs he's taken us through have really been excellent.  You want to complain about timey-wimey stuff?  I think Moffat has created the best storylines in regards to time-hopping that have been done in regards to any other science-fiction shows/movies ever, and rightly so.  I wouldn't want any other show other than Doctor Who to have created intelligent, complex stories, over arching plots and themes, and be the king of time-hopping plots.  Star Trek can kiss my lily-white Doctor lovin' ass.  Intelligent yet campy has been present even with all the old series.  Look at the secondary characters like Captain Mike Yates who fell from grace.  A story-arch that played out over multiple episodes, something that anyone else would have done in one episode and be done with it.

I've felt that Moffat's individual episodes left me wanting.  The Girl in the Fireplace was good, but like the other ones, I felt hat they could have been so much better if they were stretched out.   They didn't really take the opportunity and could have expanded the Doctor as a character.  With every new companion, more of the Doctor's character is revealed.  Also frankly, the Doctor is an enigma, a benevolent mystery man, and if they were ever to completely reveal that character to us, he would loose something.  The Doctor is like the Lone Ranger, or Zorro, or Batman in that respect.  We enjoy him more not knowing everything about him, that he comes in to save the day, then rides off into the sunset.  You don't know that much about him, but you know he's one of the good guys, and that's good enough.  Character development is done through the companions.  

If anyone finds anything confusing, they can always rewatch it and hopefully pick up on the cues that were there.  I personally have never had problem, but I am always keeping an eye out for little pieces of the puzzle.  Such as, when finding out Amy was pregnant, I immediately knew who she'd grow up to be.  But I didn't want to spoil anything for my friends, so I kept my speculations to myself.  I've absolutely loved Riversong, I do admit them trying to work in a romance with her and Matt Smith is awkward.  But I also think that it contrasts nicely with Tennant and the potiental romance we imagine that Doctor having with her.  However, Riversong I think has been one of the better story arcs they've had, ever.  It doesn't need to be linear all the time.  But I also thought the reveal wasn't as good as it could have been.  I also didn't much like the character Mels as childhood friend of Amy &amp; Rory.  If they had smattered her in here and there in previous episodes as a foil for Amy's troubled childhood, it would have been so much more brilliant.  But just sticking her in as an one-shot for 'Let's Kill Hitler', was weak and left me wanting.  Thing is Riversong needs to remain a mystery-woman, so she has some aspects of being a psuedo-timelord.  

I do not want the show to be dumbed down, ever.  If they do that, it will be like all the other crap out there.  If anything, I want them to ramp it up.  Really show me what they can do.  Pull out all the stops, if you're confused by it, fine; I won't be.  But if I am, I'll rewatch it again and again until it does make sense.  Because all this stuff is rewatchable.  If it's too simple, I would have caught all the nuiances the first time around, and I won't need to rewatch it. 

As for The Doctor's Wife.  Being a Neil Gaiman fan, I enjoyed it.  It was very Gaimey.  That being said, it is probably one of my least favourite episodes.  Well acted, but not very revealing, not very gripping.  Not really that all that entertaining as a one-shot episode.  

I think Amy and especially Rory have grown in the scope and depth as characters.  Mickey is a pale pale comparison to Rory, and frankly I would have to count Rory as one of the best male Companions we've seen on the show. 

I've also loved Sherlock.  If anything, I hope they use Benedict Cumberbatch as a blond-haired Master verses Matt Smith.  That would be the icing on the big blue cupcake. ",0,1343878984,null,0,1343879318,0,c5mx6s4,t3_xh7nu,t1_c5mx6s4,t3_xh7nu,null,1429530765,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It may be that there are many paths to get to said fixed point in time, and thus the guy and his ancestors may have had many things they could have done, and only some of those decisions were leading towards this moment (and they could have had several valid options).

It also may be the case that the only part of the event that is ""fixed"" is that SOMEBODY sent Rose downstairs -- in this case it wouldn't be that this guy and all his ancestors were on a fated path towards this moment, but that as time progressed closer and closer to this moment, fewer valid paths lead to somebody sending her down there, until the very moment it happened and this guy was the only one around and did it.

It could also be a case of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey -- this wasn't a fixed point in time until it had already happened. Once it happened, it became a fixed point and could no longer be changed. In this case, there was no predestination or fate guiding things; everybody involved still had free will to do anything, but after it was set it became one of the things in time that had to continue to happen even if timelines were altered -- whether this means it had to happen that way or, as above, could happen in any number of ways that satisfied certain conditions of the fixed point, we may never know.

1: 1:17 That Weeping Angel, its in shackles..... Its a prisoner! But goddammit, it looks so much creepier than it did before. There's something about it that makes it look so god damn creepy.... :O
2: 1:20 We see a planet blowing up. Could that be Skaro??
3: 00:49 A statue that doesn't look like a weeping angel, blows out Rory's matchstick, that confirms that there will be other types of Weeping Angels doesn't it? :D
4: 00:11 The Bronze Daleks are the main daleks in this episode? Well, either way, this trailer explains a lot more than you'd think. The bronze daleks and paradigms all gather above Earth, they get The Doctor, Amy and Rory to actually HELP them, they all go down to Earth, and uncover an asylum of classic daleks. Anyone like that idea?

Other things I like: Those robot's ""We very cross with you"", oh good, this is going to be a fun episode. Riddell and that Egyptian Queen look like they have a fun attitude, and Solomon looks like he's going to be a funny villain. This episode should be quite good, I love comedy :D

0:57 That bit where Amy says ""Geronimo"", theres a humanoid that pushes them in, who is he I wonder? Oh, and all the ranks of the paradigms are standing behind Amy, Rory, The Doctor and that humanoid dude, the blue one, the white one, and a red one.

Look closely at 1:12, I spy with my little eye, something beginning with Classic and ending with Dalek :D

I agree that there are many new fans who are unsure about who to support and what not, but that's fine. Thus, my comment about *most American soccer fans* was also based on this factor.

As to the fair-weather fan remark, it happens in all sports around the world. When Torres left Liverpool, a few fans became Chelsea supporters. When Kimi Raikkonen went to Ferrari from McLaren, he took a few fans' allegiance with him as well, and now they follow Lotus. Same can be said of fans of LeBron James. The point is, there are fans of sports personalities, who follow a team because of the sportsman, and they are generally referred as fair-weather fans. 

I was at the game in Baltimore last week, and it reminded me of going to games in Europe and Asia. The passion and enthusiasm was there.

With Dr. Who, there's usually a detail or plot point in each episode that informs the finale or theme of the season, so they're all an important part. They all have something to add, at least with history and back story, or just seeing the character develop. They will also bring back old characters and races often, and don't provide context if you missed the original episode where they appeared.

Reddit mentions the must see episodes often. Some of the better ones: Dalek (s1e6), The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (s1e9-10), Girl in the Fireplace (s2e4), Doomsday (s2e13), Blink (which you found on your own, my personal favorite), Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (s4e8-9), Turn Left (s4e11), The Waters of Mars (s4e16, technically a special/movie), Vincent and the Doctor (s5e10), The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang (s5e12-13).

If the last episode you watched is Journey's End, then that means there are still four specials you're missing out on between Journey's End and The Eleventh Hour. Planet of the Dead, The Next Doctor, Waters of Mars, and finally The End of Time which features The Doctor's regeneration.

My bit of advice, to get the most out of enjoying the next Doctor is to remember that he is *still* The Doctor. What I don't like, in order to play up The Doctor's regeneration/his leaving of the show, RTD went overboard with convincing the audience that each Doctor was a unique person. I think this has really helped to turn people off of the next Doctor, as RTD managed to put a bad taste in people's mouths about Tennant leaving(By essentially saying, within the show, that no one will replace Tennant).

Feel free to get caught up in the emotion of the episode, but just try and keep in mind that it's still the same show, and he's still The Doctor. Nothing will ever change that, despite what RTD wrote into his final episode as show runner.

true,kggyrr,pertwee,Pertwee,"Here's how I started DW: I'm not from the UK or North America and only heard about the show sporadically. A friend seemed like a huge fan of David Tennant and Matt Smith's Doctor because of her regular mention on her social networking feed, so I decided to check it out during a Christmas Break (good timing in retrospect). *Rose* was a bit weird, but nothing short of intriguing. A living plastic trying to take over the world certainly played into my fear of plastics poisoning the modern civilization. 

Before then i had little exposure to British TV and knew nothing of the long history behind the Doctor Who franchise. I assumed that Brits just like this sort of campy sci-fi shows with blurry cameras and ridiculous lighting. So I went along, even with the farting aliens, because thanks to my whovian friend, I knew that I'd eventually get to Tennant and Smith. Regrettably I didn't appreciate 9 as much as I should the first time around.

Would love to know where this load of bollocks came from. I guess the course instructor spends far too much time in illegitimate sites? There'll be a percentage of jobs that you won't get, because they have to advertise it but already know who they're gonna employ. Just read the next tweet - yes it happens, but don't think it's THAT prevalent. 

There are also detail-grabbing jobs and jobs for fraudulent businesses, but in my experience,they are very much in the minority. Isn't in the private sector job agencies to have crappy placements, which'll keep it down. 

&gt; Apparently direct.gov is not good!

If you're in the IT sector, there's better job agencies out there, who specialise in IT jobs, who know the difference between tech support, IT admin, Java dev, C# dev etc. 

That course instructor sounds INCREDIBLY racist and err... whatever ""ist"" controls her other biases.

If they really want to have a big meaningful death in the show (something we haven't had at all in the new series, as far as I can remember, not counting River, since... well, you know...), it would need to be Amy, not Rory.  Both because Amy means more to the doctor, and because Rory's already died several times.

It would also definitely create an interesting dynamic with the next companion.  Previous companion departures hit the doctor pretty hard even when he left left them in situations not much worse than where he found them in the first place and the worst part was just them having to be seperated.  If a companion actually just straight up died, that would really hurt him.

I really hope they give the new companion plenty of attention to shine and don't treat her like Martha, though.  Martha was definitely really hurt by having to live in Rose's shadow the whole time (mainly in terms of the way the Doctor treated her, but I think also to some extent in terms of the way fans view her).  They need to not make the same mistake with the new companion and have the Doctor ush her away because he's too busy mourning Amy.  It might actually be a tricky thing to accomplish, making sure the Doctor feels appropriately upset and damaged by Amy's departure (and possibly death) without making it feel like the new companion's just trapped under Amy's shadow the whole time.

It might help if she gets more time, I think.  Part of the problem with Martha was that she only got one season as the main companion.  The Doctor spent so much of that time still mourning Rose that by the time he started really appreciating Martha she didn't get much time.  If the new companion stays through season 8 it might work better because the Doctor can spend the second half of 7 mourning Amy and then the new companion will still get a full season after that to shine on her own.",0,1343901871,null,0,false,0,c5n10jn,t3_xiy6q,t1_c5n10jn,t1_c5n0e5s,null,1429532635,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;In May 2008 he was living at a hostel run by Penrose Housing Association in Fairmount Road, Brixton.


&gt;Staff there called 999 just before 17:00 BST when he smashed up a gazebo and threatened staff.

&gt;Over the next three hours, staff at Penrose made another four emergency calls to police, but help had not arrived.

&gt;By 20:00, when they made their final call, he had left the hostel and was then reported to have attacked a young couple.

&gt;Within 10 minutes of the report, he was restrained by three police officers on the Weir Estate in Brixton.

I find that is the most telling piece of information of all. Someone turns violent at a hostel, its deemed unimportant/not urgent despite the number of calls. That same person steps outside and attacks  (allegedly) a couple, then they are there in 10 mins. 

I read that as they safety of people running a hostel, the people in the hostel and the safety of the person who has turned violent is not considered urgent by police, I suspect because of their own bias to the type of people living in a hostel. However when it is taken outside to more 'ordinary' people, then it is a different matter. 

People who live in hostels are not some subculture to be ignored, usually they are the 'invisible' of society, those who fall through the gaps in the system. They are still people, some with families. many with mental health or addiction diseases, they are still entitled to police protection/help the same as anyone else.

There are hundreds of years of history we don't know about but have been alluded to. The last great Time War ended with the destruction of the Daleks and the Time Lords. The Doctor walked away.

If you kill everyone you've ever known, you're entire race, total global genocide, because you thought you were serving a greater good, or maybe out of rage, you're always going to be haunted. If you still have a soul. 

[Edit, this guy describes it much better down the page](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/xjb2w/fury_of_the_time_lord/c5n15na) It wasn't genocide as much as it is a perpetual living hell that everyone from his planet will live over, and over, forever and beyond with no rest.

Every good deed he does, he is doing to regain something inside that is so hurt and so damaged that not even saving the entire universe satiates it. He is driven to go on. He's not on vacation traveling around for fun, he's going through the entire span of time and space trying to ""repent"", trying to save as many as he can, just to find balance because of the horror and death that he's created. 

&gt;""To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word doctor means “mighty warrior.”

When you look back at your life of almost a thousand years and know something inside of you can justify killing billions on a bad day, you're not thinking of yourself as a good anything. You make rules. Lots and lots and lots of rules. It's the rules that stop him and the rules that push him forward. Without those rules, he might be the one that destroys the universe some day.

The shadows in the library fled when they looked him up. Not because he's a nice guy, because they *knew* if push came to shove, as much as he screams ""here's my rule! no genocide!"" he's done it before, and it usually takes less than a day.

The Doctor chose his own name, a wise healer. One who works tirelessly to save. 

Because he has rules now.

The TARDIS is the greatest weapon in the universe, the Doctor is the greatest Warrior. If he wanted to rule all of time and space he could have by now. He chooses to find weak, primitive humans, and save them from themselves and others that would hurt them. Show by example sacrifice by dying over, and over, and over asking for *nothing* in return. Because, rules. Lots and lots of rules. and pain.

Edits: and hope. Nobody does that if they don't have at least a little hope, even as tragically futile as it might be. His guilt and pain has driven him a little mad.

 the waters of mars
 God Gomplex and
 The DreamMaster
seem out of place is mostly because of the doctor's that the general populous  {being 10th onwards} knows him as this carefree kind of guy. 

In these episodes you see what he is destined to become { a fixed point in history  }, he is not the shining beacon of hope, not the light hearted doctor that we all love and want to keep, but he is Valeyard, the deity of Darkness, a form between the 12th and the 13th {also known as the redeeming one} where is sole purpose is to counter-act the good in the universe.
What you see is the someone who is feared by all, A man who stopped a war that made the Ancients leave, a man who controls time and space, a man who cannot die. What can make an entire universe fear you, what can make the entire universes language change the word doctor { being Healer } into warrior, what can make an entire race { being the silence } evolve just to kill him, what can make every powerful race in the entire history of the universe ban together and try and destroy thousands of fixed points in time to simply imprison him. 

If youve seen the old episodes he was ruthless, uncaring and calculating, that was closer to who he is going to be. I admit i love the doctor as he is now, seeing him take a step closer to Valeyard brings anger and pity because i dont want to lose him, but it is a fixed point in time and it has to happen

the reason why he doesn't show this much power all the time is because it would be letting go and reveling in it, and that's whats Valeyard is about{truely and honestly Punishment}, if he did this all the time it would be time for him to become Valeyard and he doesnt want that to happen. he has met Valeyard, he knows what is going to happen.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"It depends who you ask. The right of the Tory party love him and think he's a serious contender for Cameron's job. Cameron also sees him as a real threat and if you watch closely you'll see a certain amount of shadow boxing between the two of them. Labour are perplexed by him. They'd like to dress him up as a buffoon but can't deny his electoral success while the vast majority of people simply see him as a politician who has a personality.

In terms of his politics, he's a mixed bag. Although he's often plays to the right wing gallery, he is quite pragmatic and can swing to the left if circumstances dictate. However, his main weakness is not the fact that he's a bit of a dancing horse - it's that he hasn't got a great attention span and gets bored very easily. Electorally, he's golden but in terms of actually sticking to the day job he's not so great. Most of the mayoral work in London is actually done by his numerous deputies while he uses the time that's been freed up to showboat. He's not got much of an eye for detail either and while he is good at articulating grand narratives, he's not so hot on the nitty gritty.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"I think he cultivates his image as a bit of an avuncular buffon as it is helpful for him politcally.  Firstly, he was voted into power largely on the back of his media profile on shows like HIGNFY and a few cultural documentaries and he must be wary that if he becomes too serious and po-faced he will lose the appeal that got him there the first time.  I have also heard that it is a calculated move to get people to underestimate him as he is actually a lot shrewder than he comes across.  This may be true, but I also think that he is somewhat gaffe prone by nature, as his exceedingly upper class upbringing and rarefied circle of friends leaves him pretty out of touch with real people.  Therefore by having a slightly chaotic air about him at all times, people are more likely to overlook slip ups and indiscretions they would not forgive other politicians (not least trying to throw his dick up anything that moves, by all accounts).

In terms of whether he is worth taking seriously politically, the fact that people are even speaking his name in regards to the Tory leadership shows what a keen political operator he is, and he remains one of the few enclaves of the Tory brand that remains relatively untoxified.  However, he shares with the current Tory leadership a total black hole with regards to his principles and I have no idea what kind of government he would lead.

[spoiler](#s ""I have said before this entire run has been leading up to the Timelords being brought back. They are the doctors greatest ally but more often than not they are also his greatest enemy. After he essentially killed them all they are going to be kinda pissed off. He has been getting way too god like the past couple of years and needs someone on equal footing to knock him down a peg. You can throw a million Daleks at him all day and he will find a way out but one Timelord and a box is more than his match."")

[spoiler](#s ""The Doctor ended the Time War by creating 'the moment' with a modified De-Mat gun. What we know about the gun is that it removes people from time and space. It was never said they die, the are removed which implies that they could have been put somewhere else. Which The End of Time seems to indicate in that the time war is said to be time-locked. So the modified de-mat gun must have put them all into this state. If we go back to Fires of Pompeii """"Your real name is hidden. It burns in the stars, in the Cascade of Medusa herself"" and a lot of people trying to find out the Doctors name. My theory is that the Doctors name is what has locked the Time War, he some how made his true name the key to the lock and only him saying it at a certain place at a certain point in time can it be unlocked."")

[spoiler](#s ""So how does the new series fit into this? Well we know that Amy and Rory go out on a Weeping Angel episode and that River Song is back. The angels feed on Time Energy by sending people back in time to feed off the potential time energy. Rassilon referred to the descenting Time Ladies as 'like the angels of old' inferring that even he had never seen one. What if the Angels are not a natural creature but instead a Time Lord creation? Who else would have a better understanding of Time to create something that could eat Time Energy? But for what purpose? What if while they can send people back in time easily enough going forwards in time seems to be impossible for them, they are stuck passing by the years like the rest of us so absorbing all this energy may be to take that one trip to the place the Doctor has his lock so they can open it? "")

[spoiler](#s ""So how to Rory and Amy go out? They are very complex time events, they created River, they have travelled with the Doctor for a long time now. Rory has lived longer than the doctor even and Amy sat in the Pandorica for all that time. They were also there for when the universe was born for the second time. Imagine the potential energy that the Angels would get from them? There are multiple ways to open a lock, one is to use a key the other is to brute force it. Amy and Rory could be a sacrifice that allows this to happen. I would go out there and even say once this is done that the new companion, based on her description as being a match for the doctor etc, could be the result of this, one Time Lord squeezed out of the time lock."")

Now, I know Tennant's Doctor is Russell T Davies' character, and somehow bringing the Doctor's clone back (from the other universe) would be awesome, but it would feel cheap. If they brought him back, they'd have to bring Rose back too.

Now, I like Rose, but after 'Journey's End', there is no need to revisit that story-line (unless they do something big for the 50th, similar to ['The Three Doctors'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Doctors_%28Doctor_Who%29) and bring back Christopher Eccleston as well).

If any previous character would make sense in a reappearance, it would be Martha Jones (married to Mickey Smith and would not a third wheel to Rory and Amy, is part of Unit/Torchwood so she can help the Doctor with military intelligence, etc), or Sarah Jane Smith (she just always takes action), but the latter can't, [because...](http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/04/dwn190411204508-elisabeth-sladen-1948.html)

Cameron famously (or infamously, if you prefer), decided to stay quiet when asked if he'd ever smoked a spliff.  Sky News went on a witch hunt of its own and started asking *every* politician who dared to appear before a camera whether they had smoked cannabis.  The problem was, the general public didn't really give a shit.  

Of course, there are times when such witch-huntery is advantageous, as was the case with the expenses scandals.

No, Bristol.

However when it comes down to the crunch if he was leader of the tories at a national election it would lose them the election (barring things like the labour leader punching children).

He can poll well on the subject but it wont carry over to an election.

A good example where this happens repeatedly is UKIP. They often poll quite strongly 13-15% or higher and do fairly well at EU elections. However despite what the poll at even in the periods leaing up to general elections the votes never turn up because people dont trust them or take them seriously as a proper political party sitting in Parliament.

It isnt just that they dont get seats, which would be understandable as their support is is not going to get them seats in a fptp election it's that their poll numbers always far exceed the number of votes they get.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I now present my pocket starting package of info for new fans or budding fans, TADA...

I usually recommend two available ""Starting"" or *""Entry points""* for the show, which are points you can enter and then pretty much follow from there without problem. Each option has pros and cons.


OPTION 1. Start at Series 1, Episode 1 (2005) ""ROSE""

PROS: The entire Russel T. Davies Era (Series 1-4, 4.5) is pretty great and forms it's own story arc concluding with the 2009 Specials, which begins the Steven Moffat era (Series 5-on). Every story concept will be slowly re-introduced from Series 1 on for new viewers so there's no missing anything and no need to pause and quickly Google what the Doctor's referencing. Another great benefit of starting here is that it also leaves the option of getting into the spinoffs: ""Torchwood"" (whose continuity begins after Series 2 of Doctor Who) and ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" (whose continuity begins after Series 3 of Who). Both of these are excellent spin-offs, Torchwood dealing with a lot more adult themes like sex and violence and SJ. Adventures being a cool children's show I really wish I had when I was a kid.

CONS: Starting here leaves a really large back-catalogue of episodes to catch up on with about 80 episodes before you've 'caught up' to where the show is now, with even more if you want to watch the spinoffs too. With Series 7 so close to broadcast, you might not have time to fully catch up so Option 2 might be smarter at this point.

OPTION 2. Start at Series 5, Episode 1 (2010) ""THE ELEVENTH HOUR""

PROS: This series was where the show underwent a semi-rebirth gaining a new head writer and show runner and a brand new production team. New viewers won't be left in the dark at all if they start here with concepts like regeneration slowly re-introduced (though a Google search on ""regeneration"" wouldn't go astray because it becomes important in Series 6.) Starting at ""The Eleventh Hour"" will mean you'll only have to view about 26 episodes before you've caught up to current continuity, and you always have the option of going back and viewing Series 1-4 plus specials if you want the additional backstory once you've caught up.

CONS: You may miss some important backstory with the River Song character, but you can pick up on her story pretty easily (basically, she's a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future, introduced in a Series 4 episode, who will someday be very important to him for unknown reasons. At the beginning of Series 5, these reason are still unknown and the character of River Song is still a mystery. It is unknown as of Series 5 ep 1 how or why River came to know the Doctor and what relationship the pair will have in the future...that's basically all you need to know to pick the show up from Series 5, ep 1 actually.)

As for where you can find the episodes, I'm not sure how good your internet service is but the thought of watching the entire series on Netflix would be a NIGHTMARE for me, but this may differ for you. The best option personally I think would be the actual DVD or BluRay box sets which are really brilliant, come with cool little booklets, and the ones for Series 1-6 come with ""Doctor Who Confidential"", which is a separate series on the last disc of the box set showing a behind-the-scenes look at how the episode it features was made.",0,1343921738,null,0,1343922871,0,c5n44z9,t3_xjoe4,t1_c5n44z9,t3_xjoe4,null,1429534106,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"&gt;Why? If you can afford something, what is unfair about it?

Well, I'll leave aside the issue that wealth (and therefore ability to privately educate ones children) is not something that is distributed either fairly or meritocratically. The fleeing of children of the upper middle classes to the perfumed garden of private eduction negatively impacts the schooling of other children in the local comprehensive systems.  If the sharp elbowed middle class parents were willing to support their local comps and help ensure their children got a decent standard of education then it could be better for everyone.  It's no wonder that inner city comps have such an awful reputation where in some areas everyone who's parents went to university whips them out of the state sector before they can understand multiplication.  And this is without even imagining what the untold billions spent on private education could be put towards if instead it was used to support the state sector.

I hear the argument of 'having to do what's best for your children', but this situation is a vicious circle that will not improve until short sighted looking out for ones own is replaced by a genuine civic mindedness that acknowledges that the only way to improve society is to participate to the fullest extent.
&gt;Whereas state schools instil in their pupils a sense that all they are good enough to be toilet cleaners and road sweepers? 

Clearly not.  But one only has to look at the educational background of the majority of cabinet ministers and CEOs to realise the stranglehold that the private education system holds over the seats of power in this country.  The entire purpose of private schools, especially the elite ones, is to mould its pupils into the sort of people who excel at getting ahead in these areas.  And it's not just through academic ability, it is about steeping people in a culture which is respected by the older generation of the powerful in this country.  The power of a school tie might not still be what it once was, but i'll bet public school old boys are often employed over their state school contemporaries through some misguided notion of having 'the right stuff' (i.e. speaks RP english, likes rugger and cricket, can have a good old natter about the slopes of Val D'Isere over a bottle of a decent red)",0,1343923440,null,0,false,0,c5n4l8a,t3_xk6fn,t1_c5n4l8a,t1_c5n3t4k,null,1429534319,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Bassong for example, I would normally pronounce Sebastian as ""Seh [Bastion](http://supergiantgames.com/site/wp-content/uploads/Bastion_092010_00041.jpg)"" but I always hear ""Seh bass tee enn"" so I end up saying that. 

I think it's the more exotic names that I end up pronouncing closer to their real or British pronunciation. Aaron Lennon is such a common sounding name that I just pronounce it as if I knew someone named Aaron Lennon in Minnesota. 

I used to pronounce the stone in Huddlestone but over the course of a few years it's sort of naturally gone away.

I think I spend too much time with English football, because not only have I adopted the accent for some names, I find myself using British expressions and football-related language naturally. 5 years ago I would have never said ""top"" or ""lovely"" or ""that's brilliant"" or ""good shout"" in normal conversation but I do so naturally now and I have to catch myself or I sound like a dumbass.

It's also completely ruined my ability to consistently use ""is"" vs ""are"" when talking about sports teams. In Britain it's basically always ""are"" (ie: Tottenham are close to signing Adebayor, Chelsea are a despicable club, etc). In America it's very often ""is"" (ie: Pittsburgh is close to signing Antonio Brown, Minnesota is building a new stadium). When it's the actual team nickname it's always ""are"", but when just saying the city name I just randomly oscillate between them.

true,ColonelFlashman,wales-carmrthenshire,West is Best,"&gt;Well, I'll leave aside the issue that wealth (and therefore ability to privately educate ones children) is not something that is distributed either fairly or meritocratically.

I find it hilarious that somehow you think that life should be fair. Some people are born fat, thin, clever, stupid, good looking, ugly, rich, poor. Life isn't meritocratic.

&gt;If the sharp elbowed middle class parents were willing to support their local comps and help ensure their children got a decent standard of education then it could be better for everyone.

So people should sacrifice giving their kids a better chance in life because the parents whose kids do go to local comps aren't willing to support the school?

&gt;untold billions spent on private education could be put towards if instead it was used to support the state sector.

Why would people spend their own money on state schools? That defeats the object. Putting kids in private school actually puts less pressure on comprehensives as the class sizes would be even bigger otherwise!

&gt;The power of a school tie might not still be what it once was, but i'll bet public school old boys are often employed over their state school contemporaries through some misguided notion of having 'the right stuff' (i.e. speaks RP english, likes rugger and cricket, can have a good old natter about the slopes of Val D'Isere over a bottle of a decent red)

All I hear is jealousy. Employers by and large don't give a shit about background anymore, especially during the current financial crisis, they want who is the best for the job.

&gt;""He's like fire and ice and rage. He's like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun. He's ancient and forever. He burns at the centre of time and can see the turn of the universe. And... he's wonderful.""

That's actually a pretty good quote, in that it doesn't actually answer OP's question - and I don't know that there is a convincing answer in the traditional way.

You look at those descriptors: fire, ice, rage, night, ancient, forever, etc. Almost all of them don't actually *do* anything - at least nothing other than what's intrinsic to their existence (yes, fire burns, but that's only because it's its entire nature - without burning, it's no longer fire at all).

The Doctor doesn't *do* anything in the sense that superheroes do stuff (Spider Man shoots webs, Bat Man wears a mask and beats the shit out of bad guys after terrifying them, Superman flies and can turn back time), he just *is* stuff.

He endures, he out-exists other individuals, civilizations and races, problems, traps and conundrums.

He uses his very being to simply be better than his opponents. He bears the burden of longevity (immortality?) and all the responsibilities of all the knowledge of time and space, and by bearing it steadfastly, tenaciously and with utmost determination, he defeats everybody who deserves to be defeated in much the same way that the ocean defeats a massive continent of rock.

Huds and Jake are definitely not as great DLP's as we have given them credit for here, in the past.  But, I think Gylfi and vdv could do it.  Still would rather get a real one, like Moutinho or Dembele.

Hard to tell at this point whether you are correct about Bale being our best player, but I'd bet it will be a left sided player.

I'm optimistic that our CB's can run faster than Terry.

Gallas was impressive, still not sure he will make the whole season.

Still not convinced we don't need another keeper.  We didn't face the best offenses on this tour, at all.  I think the high line will expose Big Brad.  And, it's not very often you can get a player like Lloris for the price.  Facken do it.

I find the BBC commentary a lot more egalitarian, focusing on the most interesting gymnasts not just their national ones. I'm really sick of shots focused on gymnasts faces waiting to hear their score, when from the crowd you can hear something amazing happening elsewhere. Also their commentators are a lot more technical, which I appreciate.

The people with the most to gain from spreading bullshit are news sources that are looking for website hits and newspapers sales, or agents who are looking to drive up their clients' values (mention interest from us, and I'm sure other clubs get a little twitchy).
