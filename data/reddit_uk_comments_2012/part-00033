true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"&gt; But the truth is in the UK, it comes going to choosing the lesser of 2 evils.

That mentality is what turned the US into the complete clusterfuck of a joke of a democracy that it is - the majority don't even consider that there are more than 2 options, they barely even consider a world where more than 2 political parties even exist because it's all they've ever known.

It's extremely dangerous for us to keep going on like this, but no you don't have to vote for the lesser of 2 evils at all, you can vote for the *least* evil.

Here's some things to consider though:

 * Your single vote won't tip the scales anyway
 * The above might make some people think ""why bother voting then""
 * That's dangerous thinking because if everyone thought that then no one would vote - and also it means you're not being counted at all (regardless of if it could tip the scales anyway) - but also is point 1 dangerous thinking in that case?
 * No, because if everyone thought that their vote wouldn't tip the scales and then they instead all went and voted for the least evil entirely rather than just the lesser of 2 evils? That would be awesome! Way better than not turning out to vote, haha.
 * But consider this: What does voting for a non-major party achieve, if it doesn't get a win? Does it mean you threw your vote away?
 * No, because it still lowers the % of votes for the big parties which means they have to try just that little bit harder, even by 1 vote.
 * Therefore the more people who realise they don't have to vote for the lesser evil, the better. Even if:
 * It won't make a difference to who is actually elected under FPTP, sure - however it *does* show in the numbers, it *does* drop the % of Labour/Tory and it *does* make them realise they need to do something to get voters back as they slip away to these other parties, or spoiling their ballots.
 * This is why I support ballot spoiling, because it shows that you are an active voter, it means you are counted, shows in the numbers, and still shows the big parties that they have a growing minority to contend with if either of them want to stay in power
 * Do yourself a favour and vote in a principled way, vote for what you believe in, but don't be fooled by the fallacy that you have to help someone win so that the other people don't win because it's simply not true - THAT is truly throwing your vote away, you're just pissing into a big pool of Labour
 * That is exactly what supports their ongoing confidence that they will always be re-elected
 * All of the above doesn't just apply to people on the left, plenty of right wing Tory votes would happily vote for a different right wing party too if they realised the above
 * This change in mentality could change our politics for the better
 * So vote for what you believe in and smile smugly when you see the % of the vote that went to Tory&amp;Labour as you consider that you made that number 0.00000003% smaller!
 * Nothing bad will happen as a direct result of you doing this, but a tiny amount of good can come from it
 * And as mentioned it's not a dangerous thing, this works well if only 1 person does it, and if millions do it then all the better!",0,1332516230,null,0,false,0,c444lkp,t3_r9pqs,t1_c444lkp,t1_c4445qv,null,1428579643,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"These days everyone I know who goes out to get pissed has pre-drinks at home.  So prices are high enough that clubs and pubs are already loosing out that way.  The question is whether the increase in prices in super markets but not pubs (who for now at least already meet the minimums) will help pus or hurt them.

It may be that since the prices are closer anyway people will ""pre drink"" less, maintaining the same total spending but shifting more of it to the pub.

Or it may be that people ""pre drink"" more since prices from the super market are still lower and that way they can get just as hammered for the same total spend.

The actual outcome depends on whether these people place a higher value on getting pissed, or on being in pubs/clubs.

My guess is that the people doing the heavy drinking will be happier getting very pissed and spending less time (and so money) out.

But that is just my guess...

To tell you the truth I think the decline of pubs is not about the price of booze.  In most pubs a drink (pint of beer, glass of wine, cocktail etc) costs less than a coffee does in Starbucks.  Check the queues outside Starbucks most days and see if paying ~£3 for a drink and somewhere to drink it is an issue for the average adult.  The truth is people are busy, you can work in a coffee shop in a way you can't in a pub, you don't get slowed down by caffeine like you do by ethanol, it does not stop you driving home after, their is no hangover (unless you really hit it) and it is less socially looked down on.

That is why pubs are emptying, and turning into piss up sites for the under 30s:  If you are older you would rather be clear headed, do something productive and not feel the worst for ware tomorrow.

The problem is people do not sober up when they leave the pub doors and, really, bouncers and a police presence just move the problems from the location and town center out a little to the residential areas near by...

Of course I am a total cynic and I think if people want to get drunk and commit crimes they should just be arrested like sober criminals and if they want to ruin their livers, then that is their choice.

Another great one-shot episode is Season 4, Episode 10 (Midnight). That's got a great deal more of the Doctor himself.    
    
Yet another good episode is Season 5, Episode 10 (Vincent and the Doctor). I also just realized that episode 10 of every season since 2005 (except season 2) is a good episode. :)    
    
Assuming you watch an episode and you're hooked, I'd recommend starting at the 2005 Season 1, Episode 1 (Rose) and move forward from there.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Let's Kill Hitler was a *mess*. 

We've got Mel, Rory and Amy's ""totally-been-here-the-whole-time-you-just-hadn't-met-her"" best friend who (despite being *specifically* programmed to kill the Doctor and having a loaded weapon in her hand with the Doctor *completely defenseless*) chooses to inexplicably decide to hijack the TARDIS and kill Hitler *for the sole purpose of making the title make sense*.

Forgetting for a second that little Melody somehow managed to go to New York (for some reason throwing a monkey-wrench in her Silent-master's plans by warning Nixon for no reason) to Britain and grow up with Rory and Amy (apparently getting mindwashed sometime before this, though obviously logistics are thrown out the window) let's focus on how little it makes sense for the Silents to put Mel *anywhere near* her real parents, let alone be educated in a London public school.

And then we have the Tesselecta, the single most ridiculous and unnessecary concepts introduced to Doctor Who since I don't even know when. Taking a page from the obviously genius playbook of Meet Dave, the Tesselecta is a ship designed to appear human manned by shrunken down people. Why they wouldn't use a goddamn android and pilot it remotely from a safe distance is *beyond me*.

Their reasons for being there are nearly as contrived as the rest of the cast, having somehow managed to sneak into the Reichstach, straight up murder a dude, and get into Hitler's office and nearly reveal themselves before they realize they're *three goddamn years off*.

But it's not like the ""torture time criminals"" team has any real standards. Their workplace is so hazardous that if the machine fails to read your ID within twenty second you get *fucking atomotized*.

But let's continue, beccause currently we have Hitler in a cupboard, Rory with a bruised fist, Amy looking surprised as usual, the Doctor getting all cocky, ""Mel"" with a gunshot wound and hundreds of shipmates trapped in a non-functioning ship that if captured by literally *anyone else in the building* would result in the Nazis *having alien technology and hostages from the future* (massive design flaw there, but let's press on)...

So Mel turns into River and the show acts like this is a surprise when literally anyone with half a brain who'd been following the show could have called that and her and the Doctor go through a ""witty"" back and forth of ""here's how I kill you"" ""here's how I foil"" to eat up screentime.

This all ends up culminating after a series of ridiculous instances of River becoming a non-regeneratable Time Lord (which we already could have figured from Silence in the Library) by undoing her assassination attempt.

Yeah, that brainwashing (which really wasn't clear as brainwashing, we never do see Mel being actually brainwashed at any point in time) just goes away. Not like a snapping out of hypnosis, but as a ""oh, the plot needs me to be good, so let's just go with a ""power of love"" thing and wrap this whole thing up.

The episode reaved *any* possibility of telling more about River's past, filling it up with an incessant montage of Mel being a brat *and* shoehorned in the ridiculous Tesselecta for the sole purpose of being brought back later as a MacGuffin.

Overall this episode did *nothing* but pull apart continuity snarls and they have the character's personalities awkwardly being yanked to suit events instead of events being shaped by the characters.

Basically, class is and always has been self-defined. There was a point where the government would 'class' people, but to date, class consciousness is self-defined, hence you have ardent Labour and Tory supporters and the traditional 'class warfare' thing.

The problem is that with Labour being in power for so long, apathy has caused a 'calcification' of class definitions. Most people are of the opinion they have no class and just 'are', and yet they feel outrage at the tax reduction and the benefit changes and the alteration of the welfare state; there's some kind of emergence of people redefining their class based on their income, amongst people who already define their class irrespective.

I went to secondary school in Scotland in the 1970s. Their attitude to discipline was  ... robust. But we still had kids who attacked the teachers. Even though they would get beaten up by the staff in ""self defence"" and then charged with assault. Some of the kids learned the wrong lesson: might was right and they just needed a bit more firepower.  

Fast froward to 2012. One of my acquaintances is an annoying parent. Her son is a precious snowflake whose individuality is being squashed by the evil school. If they try to give him a detention she tries to get him out of it. 

Maybe parents should be held more accountable for their kids' misdeeds, so that they are more motivated to co-operate with the schools? Or is that unfair on parents at their wits end with out of control teenagers?

It's hard to say what kind of experience and maturity comes with thousands of years of aging.

With that said, I think you're looking towards a few lines, and ignoring the rest of Smith's acting/eleven's tenure.  I think he plays an old man greatly. He knows the ways of the Universe, he's seen horrible things happen. Sure, he feins knowledge/intelligence sometimes, but we've seen him get deep and dark with his reactions. Moments like in The Girl Who Waited where he *knows* he can't let older Amy on board the TARDIS, and he knows lying to her was a horrible thing. You can see it in his expression. But he knew it had to be done, because he's seen what that kind of thing can do to the time vortex. Other times like Vincent and The Doctor. He was goofy the whole time, but at the end where Amy gets optimistic about Vincent's possible future, he walks behind her knowing that they didn't change anything. Knowledge he had from thousands of years of experience with this very same thing.

I personally think Smith has played the perfect 'Old man in a young body' role. Of course he'd be energetic and run around like he does. That's what any old man with a young body would do. However, when it's time to get serious, you can see the ages upon ages behind Smith's eyes.

Not to a ridiculous extent, you understand, but having brought me up to be well behaved they would of course give an official the benefit of the doubt. Not that they'd punish me without asking my side of the story, but there's no way they'd treat the school or teachers in a fashion your acquaintance seems to.

I'm not putting a slight on Smith's acting capabilities, as there's no denying the are certainly extensive. I am merely noting that there are several blips of this oddly childish and naive behaviour.

Have a met someone who is thousands of years old? Why of course I have, just spoke at the coffee shop on my way back into town. Of *course* I haven't met any thousand-year old people!

I think it's interesting that you say he ""feigns"" stupidity because feigning stupidity was [a superb skill of Tom Baker's Doctor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSJMF7HG0sc). In Tom Baker's case he always gives this air of playing coy in everything he does, this is key in delivering lines and actions that would otherwise make the Doctor appear thick or childish.

The Eleventh in a startling number of instances has shown an unprecedented lack of understanding of simple things. In the Lodger he causes more harm than good for poor Craig with outright obliviousness. In the Pandorica Opens he similarly doesn't realize that Rory is standing right in front of him. In Victory of the Daleks he reverts to a ""get rid of all Daleks"" that he had previously gotten past in Daleks in Manhattan and the Fourth Season Finale and his childish tantrum resurrected otherwise helpless Daleks.  Throughout the Eleventh's tenure there's been a notable number of instances where he appears oblivious to human customs or even understanding basic human behaviour as well whereas he has previously shown himself to be well-traveled and versed in a host of different customs.

The Doctor can't understand basic currency when previously he could and forgets which century he's in and has to do basic arithmatic out loud to figure it out. Honestly I would attribute this all to senility, but that's not how Smith plays it.

He doesn't play the Eleventh as senile he plays the Eleventh as a bit oblivious with the smallest touch of his own youth.

She needed to get close to The Doctor, close enough to *actually* kill him. Forcing him on an adventure was her way of doing so.

The Tesselecta isn't forced, and you even bring up a point about Nazis taking it over and having alien technology....umm...no. You even said yourself, the machine is heavily guarded, and if you are not recognized by the 'antibodies' then you'll be atomized within moments. *This is a safety measure*.

You can't use the machine if you're not verified by it, first. I thought that was fairly obvious.

And, finally, The Doctor overcomes the brainwashing by being himself. That was the whole point of him being in the TARDIS, and little Amelia saying 'Fish fingers and custard' to him. It was to remind him of how he acted towards Amy, and how he was able to win her over. In Time Lord ages, River was probably just about as mature as Amelia at this point, anyway. That's why, when he shows up, he walks out of the TARDIS acting the way he does, despite the fact that he's dying. Then, if you remember, the tipper to this situation wasn't love. It was when River realized that, unlike her, The Doctor actually still cared if his friends were in trouble.

-Pandorica Opens is just reaching for straws.  He was busy trying to figure out how to stop the Pandorica from opening as well as fighting off every major villain in the Whoniverse at once, so they could not get the Pandorica. It was a major and stressful moment for him. I don't blame him for taking a moment to realize Rory was standing right in front of him. Especially since it's the last place he would expect to see him. Hell, I've done this sort of thing myself when I'm stressed out and I have a random friend approach me that I didn't expect, let alone someone I thought was wiped from time and space.

-We've seen how The Doctor reacts around the Daleks, post-Time War. It isn't always rational, and there's no way he could have known that by stating 'I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks' he would resurrect an ancient sect of Daleks. That's just silly.

Just because he acts the way he does, and feigns ignorance, doesn't make him ignorant. That's the *definition* of feigning ignorance.

CS gas is an area effect weapon in the wrong conditions, so it's likely that both officers and the dog would be effected, but the dog would recover faster and be more pissed off. A taser might have been more useful.

*However*, all shots hit his chest and only one pierced his heart(s). In The End of Time the Doctor arms himself with a pistol with the intent of killing Rassilon. This would seemingly indicate that you *can* kill a Time Lord with a handgun, likely by shooting in the head or otherwise.

That's not feigning ignorance, that's a mistake which he apologizes for. He grabs a toothbrush instead of a sonic and makes other obvious *blunders* throughout that adventure, clear mistakes.

I'll take your point in the Pandorica Opens, but only so far. This wasn't a split second double-take, this was the Doctor not realizing that he was speaking to Rory, who is supposed to be dead.

The Doctor matured when facing the Daleks to the point where he admonished his meta-crisis induced clone for genociding them. He had grown to the point where he could rationally face the Daleks and even respect them as a form of life. HE then reverts back to Nine's violent hatred of the race as if all the development he gained was suddenly lost.

Again, there's clear evidence that he's *not feigning*. He makes clear mistakes like not understanding money, or greetings, or timeframes. He complains like a child in Vincent and the Doctor when one would expect patience. It's extremely didactic to see this thousand-year-old being behaving in a very young way and making honest mistakes that hurt him instead of helping him.

A sort of puckish fun, but with this sense of mysterious purpose and wisdom behind every speech.

I don't need the Doctor to say ""well in my day..."" or go on about how he had already faced these exact monsters back in a Third Doctor adventure. Doctor Who isn't about where he's been, it's always where he's going. But I still can't feel totally behind a Doctor if he hasn't got that air of wisdom and experience on his back. And *nobody* wants to see a cranky Doctor again.

The Doctor's the best when he's just himself and in the early works when he's with Rose you really do get to see glimpses of the Doctor genuinely enjoying himself and being who he really is: a person.

Every Doctor has difficulties in the beginning (the Eighth Doctor didn't even know who he was or what he was doing when he first regenerated!) but each of them has carried the experience of the others on their backs. It's been this steady progression towards a more thoughtful and wise Doctor.

My explanation for 11's childishness and lack of social ability is that, like 10 said, it really was a death for him and a 'new man' walked away. Maybe this didn't happen for all incarnations, but since 10 felt that he was really going to die, maybe he knew that his next incarnation would be a radical change. 11 could be a new younger (yet still old) incarnation still learning the ropes.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I can get that, I suppose it's that playing old and young is a very tricky line to tightrope. Smith obviously is going for old acting young, but it comes off as young acting old acting young (well, that sounded more coherent in my head, but I hope I got the point across).

I can get behind change, in fact that's Doctor Who's strongest attribute. They changed Nine to Ten, Rose to Martha, Martha to Donna, and at no point did I think ""this is bad, the show's just not believable"". I *love* how Doctor Who is willing to reinvent itself and that's why I'm a bit irked at Moffat's reign.

In Ten you can see that the ""rude and not ginger"" Ten we meet at the start is not the same after Rose leaves and is not the same by the end of his tenure. When all's said and done he didn't have to regenerate to become a totally different person.

I don't see a whole lot of that in Smith. The Eleventh Doctor we saw in the pilot feels exactly the same as the one we see now. Still a bit daft, still saying ""x's are cool"", still the same guy, and that disheartens me a bit.

This Doctor has flirted with death more than any other Doctor, and yet I don't see him much for the wear after all's said and done. I suppose I don't need centuries of experience on his back, but at least development from the passing adventures in a meaningful way would help out a great deal.

I really do hope that Smith settles into his role better (most actors do on their third seasons) and he'll wow us with some blow-me-back scenes.

It's worth noting also that the NI planning system (unlike most EU planning systems) doesn't have a third party right of appeal. Although, if the development is big enough, there is usually a period of public consultation before the relevant planning officer decides to grant planning permission or not. But if the application is permitted there is nothing a third party can do. So if a house is built near you which constricts your view for example, you can't appeal the decision. So, if planning permission is already granted, even if the development was in Northern Ireland, there is nothing you can do via the Planning Appeals Comission to appeal the decision. 

So there is definitely nothing you can do via PAC or your local council to appeal the approval of planning permission for a development in the ROI. You would need to contact the relevant authorities in the south as it is their jurisdiction. The ROI has a different planning system, which has third party rights of appeal. You can make a comment upon a planning application for a small fee, 5 weeks after the local authority receives the application. In the ROI you can appeal a planning decision as a third party, but only if you made a comment (officially a ""submission/observation"") before the decision was made. You make an appeal through An Bord Pleanála. So basically what you should do now is contact the local authority of the area in which the planning application was made and see about making a comment on it.

true,hoogiz,null,null,"I'm not at Cambridge, but just went through the admissions process and now have an offer, and here's my advice from my experiences. 

Whilst I wasn't in your situation academically speaking, I was never an outstanding student, and all I can say is get the PS and grades as good as they can be, and then at interview make your interviewer interested, sell yourself as a fun student to teach and think and talk intelligently. I think they would choose someone with a rocky academic past but with a huge enthusiasm for the subject over a flawless student academically who just sat there with no passion any day. 

So therefore I would say if you want it that badly of course give it a shot. Read a lot, know your science and have lots of practice interviews. Then find one specific niche aspect of NatSci you LOVE. And learn about it in detail, mention it in your PS so they will talk about it and blow them away with your knowledge. 

Then finally whilst being realistic you must not think that Cambridge is the end of it all.

As you can see, we are MILES behind where we need to be in matchday revenue.  We need a bigger stadium and pricier tickets, there's just no way around this.  

Our commercial revenue is already the second highest in the league at £64m (above Liverpool even!), but this will massively grow these coming accounts thanks to the new Etihad deal.  We will finally know how much it is REALLY worth.

You are right, the more I think about it, the more their inclusion in this event seems wrong, although I think it was done with good intentions on the schools part. If they even scare 1 girl from seeking proper advice about an abortion then their inclusion was at too high a cost.

I think I am making a lot of assumptions about the type of event this school held as well, and I have given them a lot of credit which they have not necessarily deserved.

Gay marriage for me is a non-issue as it doesn't really pose a challenge for the status quo. In America it is useful because it works with the US people's blood-lust for hate figures whilst tying up resources and debate, but it offers little leverage here. Camp comedy likely broke the back of that issue decades ago: pantomime drag queens, Carry Ons, Kenny Everet, Julian Clairy, etc, etc. As for progressive laws, you have seen the recent budget?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Good lord, the search bar didn't work? *What did you type in?* Anywho,

First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only, reconstructions are in place for the missing episodes).

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His era is mostly missing so its hard to get a grip his era. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

**Colin Baker, sixth**- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**- Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

I can understand your apprehension, when I first arrived I can remember driving down one country road to round a corner and find a large group of men of mix ages blocking the road and staring at me, my first though was ""shit, is this the IRA?"", the second ""Good job I sold that landrover."", actually it was just a group of guys Road Bowling (seeing who could throw a cannon ball over a set distance in the least number of throws, which might explain all the potholes - the main roads a great, the country roads significantly less so, infrastructure investment outside Dublin and the other major cities tends to be poor).

With the qualifier that I never went to the border regions during ""marching season"" I never once encountered any anti-English sentiment, indeed everyone was very friendly and welcoming.

As with London, for better or worse there's very much a Dublin centric focus on the country: you can feel a little provincial if you're outside it, but that wont impact on you. The city itself has a similar cosmopolitan vibe as London, lots to see and do as well.

While wages tend to be better, the day to day cost of living (e.g. food, rent) and other purchases are higher. However with the property market still bottomed out after the crash it's not a bad time to purchase - just get a thorough survey done on any modern property built during the building boom, some of them where rather thrown together, and take a look at the surrounding area to ensure that it has sufficient services - town/city/country Planning during the boom was very poor, large estates thrown up without thought to such things are doctors, schools, whether there was enough water pressure, etc.

Driving is very similar to the UK with a few quirks: notably if someone is driving slowly and notices someone behind them, they will pull into the hard shoulder to let them overtake. The person overtaking then briefly flashes their hazard lights by way of thanks (at least I hope that's what it means and that I havent been insulting everyone) Its kind of a nice idea, avoiding frustrated motorists from doing risky overtaking, just be sure that you've got good visibility and that the hard shoulder is clear. If you intend to stay you'll need to switch your driving license to an Irish one at some point, but that's just a matter of filling out a form from the local Garda (police) station. A full UK driving license is directly exchangeable for an Irish one and visa-verse, so dont have any worries about having to retake your test if you decide to come back. Be prepared for toll roads on the major roads (though that's something that sounds like we'll be getting back in the UK too).

There's certainly *some* disgruntlement going on, I'll give you that.

I say it ""ruins"" the subreddit because instead of having discussion and debate about a TV show - even the announcement of a new co-star, which is still a fresh topic - we have *this* again. Yes, I know that there are other threads about Jenna-Louise Coleman, but as a thought - just a musing, really - instead of the time and effort spent in reposting an already tired, trite and old meme, why not contribute that time and effort in making a new thread about Coleman's casting? Speculation? Discussion? Conversation? 

I know, radical concepts for /r/doctorwho, but lend me your ears. 

I say this stuff ""ruins"" the subreddit because *another Doctor Who subreddit* actually had to form where people can actually talk about episodes without having to sift through random screenshots of David Tennant, a picture of ""Bad Wolf"" scribbled in a public restroom, someone mashing together another ""Rose + 10 Forever"" picture, and another ""omg is it august yet TIME PASSES SO SLOWLY LOL"" screencap of ""Vincent and the Doctor"". 

I know, this isn't the first time we've had this conversation, and it won't be the last. So we downvote threads like these, we ignore them, etc. etc. They still keep cropping up, though, like a genital wart on your honeymoon. It's incredibly frustrating.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well here's why. The main character (the Doctor) is male, so we need a female lead, lest the show is accused of sexism. Plus, just to balance it out. It would be a strange dynamic if the companion was significantly older than the Doctor's (apparent) age and would be an unnecessary risk on the BBC's part to viewer ratings (because, as much as we hate to admit it, prettier people get more views).

Said companion is probably also going to be from our century to be relateable. Again, why stray from a good companion format when it works and sells? I'm not saying I *like* this system, but the BBC is all about money and this is what has worked. Since the dawn of the show.

Susan Foreman (1963), Peri, Nyssa, Tegan, Jo, Leela, Sarah Jane, Romana I, Romana II, Victoria, Rose, Grace, Martha....

See. It's really not surprising. Just bummering for us extreme fans. The show will always cater to the general audience because they outnumber us. And even if you don't think Nyssa/Rose/Grace is hot, they're probably prettier to look at than a Silurian or a robot. It's a bummer.

If you want radical companions, try the Big Finish radio dramas. Those things cater to the fans. The whole franchise is for the fans- which also means it's expensive, but it's quality stories and well worth it. There are alternate universe companions (C'rizz), guys (Hex, Oliver), and a mesomorph shapeshifter, Frobisher, who looks like a penguin.

Plus the dramas bring back awesome companions like Peri and Mel *without* the traits that made them annoying in the show. Like the screaming and fashion sense (both of which I, personally, am oblivious to). They have stories that expand on your favorite villains or characters, and lots of multiple Doctor stories and some stories that are pure fanwank.

My advice is all based around getting the tapes converted - you could do this yourself with a PAL compatible video player and a capture card (either hardware accelerated or do the conversion using software) or you could pay someone else to do it for you. If you have a player you could play the tapes directly but they will wear and don't age that gracefully (plus you have to get up and change tapes - how retro!).

Do it yourself: Better if you have lots to convert, harder to get quality equipment at a cost you can afford. Takes more of your time.

Pay someone else to do it: They are more likely to have a quality 6+ head video player, will cost more in general. Less of your time required.

I advised her earlier that converting from 25fps interlaced PAL to 29.997 fps interlaced NTSC (a common strategy) would not generally look very good but to be honest it doesn't even sound that you are all that interested in the process in general.

If you can't find anyone interested in helping you do this (perhaps so they can keep copies too) and $100 is too much for the endeavour then I would say there is no real point in exploring this further.

I would offer to do this myself but unless you are willing to foot the postage to Australia (which would probably be ~$100) then that won't work either.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"Brilliant response, really good, because you're showing exactly the problem that public transportation faces.

You've equated the direct petrol cost as the total cost to travel. This is wrong. You're ignoring the costs of purchase, insurance, taxation, maintenance, depreciation, parking etc. The cost of your train ticket (has to) include all of these, so naturally it's more expensive.

But, and this is a big but (I cannot lie): I can estimate your total cost per mile and depending on assumptions it's anywhere from 2x to 5x fuel costs (disagree? Take it up with the AA whose table I used: [AA Running Cost Tables](http://www.theaa.com/allaboutcars/advice/advice_rcosts_petrol_table.jsp)).

So your actual cost for the trip is somewhere between £16 and £40, but I'd guess closer to £20-£25. 

On that basis, the ticket cost of £28 isn't so bad; depending on your outlook it starts to look reasonable. But, again, pure costs ignore the ""inconvenience cost"" of public transport: You have to get to it, wait for it, and organise your travel around IT'S convenience. 

Which is why the cost needs to be cheaper, much much cheaper, than the cost of driving - to compensate for the ""social"" losses of public transport.",0,1332586809,null,0,false,0,c44f10s,t3_rb6aq,t1_c44f10s,t1_c44ew7c,null,1428584746,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Really you've got two distinct goals:

1.Get an interview

2.Get a place 


Your first problem is getting an interview, and this is where the personal statement comes in. Spend a long time getting it right. Be sincere, explain your situation, talk yourself up as much as you can without being boasting. It's a tricky balance to hit: don't be afraid to ask other people for input, because when you spend several hours writing 500 words you lose perspective a bit. Most importantly, explain why you want to come to Cambridge.

Once you've got an interview, there's not a whole lot you can do to prepare except for very general things. I think the interview is probably going to be the easier part for you - if you're genuinely smart and motivated, that will come across.

Good luck!

Unless all my journeys can be done economically (both time and money) by public transport or hire car, that's not true, making the cost of a journey just the extra running costs of that journey.

Using the AA's tables you used, that tells me that the incremental cost to me of an extra journey in my car are about 1.5x to 2x the fuel costs - making his journey £12 to £16. The remainder is apportioning a part of my standing costs to this journey, which is not necessarily a reasonable assumption to make - e.g. I run a car as my commute (arranged so that my wife is in walking distance of her workplace) is not practical by public transport - it takes 2.5 hours each way by public transport (should be 1.5 hours if everything kept to timetable, but that never seems to happen), or 45 minutes by road.

And that brings up yet another nail in the coffin of public transport - even ignoring the cost issue, and assuming that they managed to get the buses and trains to both run to timetable, I would spend twice as much time commuting in order to take the train. For some of my colleagues, it gets even crazier - their public transport commute would be a similar time to mine (1.5 hours if everything ran to time, 2.5 if it doesn't), but their road commute is 15 to 20 minutes.

Oh, and as a final problem - the train ticket at £28 is for one person. Excluding my commuter use of the car, I'm normally taking two people in the car - and it will soon be two adults, one child for most journeys outside my commute.

My first car, made about ~25 years ago, gave me about 35MPG over the time I owned it. I think quoted MPG was around the 40MPG mark. That's about 15% below estimate.

My current car gives me ~45MPG in actual use. Quoted MPG is 55MPG. That's a difference of about 20%

The two aren't even remotely comparable as cars (1.0L Austin Metro vs. 2.0 Diesel Passat), but the modern equivalent - something like a 1.2 Polo which is about the same size as the Metro - claims 51MPG combined cycle, which I'd reduce to 45MPG actual. So the improvement in efficiency for comparable cars is only about 30%.


Fuel costs have gone up approximately 3x since then (~40p/Litre then, ~£1.40 now). 'T Intarnets tells me inflation accounts for 70% of that rise (£100 in 1990 is worth £170 now). 

So the cost per mile of fuel (which, depending on circumstances, is only about 20%-50% of actual cost per mile) will STILL HAVE INCREASED over that time, because the gains in efficiency have been swamped by the increase in fuel costs.

If you're thinking of biology I think the Babraham Institute near Cambridge runs a funded(?) summer lab thing for sixth formers.

The one concern I would have with those grades is the maths. Are you taking A2 maths but not predicted an A, or not taking A2 maths? If you're going for biological sciences then not having the A2 will be okay, if you're going for physical sciences they will probably expect an A at A2.

Also, for your own sake I hope your mental health is alright now, because Cambridge is pretty stressful, and while they are getting better at accomodating mental health needs, it can trigger mental health issues in people.

Eventually, after pointing out to them how angry the bad communication and the unfixed issues made us, one of the management people at Alba has made herself our primary contact point, and is indeed paying a good amount of attention to telling us what happens -- but the landlord still refuses to do repairs we consider genuinely important.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","You're being optimistic there - I bought my current car expecting fuel costs to reach ~£10 per litre in today's money during the lifetime of the vehicle. Assuming that public transport is unaffected by fuel costs (not a good assumption, I know), that's the point at which it becomes economic for me to take public transport, ignoring any time penalty.

It's scary, but that's the reality of the UK's public transport network - for one person, it's cheaper to drive, and as soon as you're moving two or more people, it's completely uneconomic compared to hiring a car. I can't see this changing any time soon - we need major subsidy for public transport to make it work.

If I was Dictator, I'd be subsidising local buses such that each bus journey you take costs you around 10p - that would make the two buses I'd need to take to my mum's house on the other side of town cost just 40p return for me, or £1.60 return for a family of 4. I'd also subsidise passenger rail to the point where it's equivalent to driving a 100 mpg car for 4 people - or a 400 mpg car for one person. I'd have to increase taxes to make that happen, of course.

Edit: As a side note, this is why I'd like to see VED abolished in favour of congestion charge zones covering in-town driving at busy times. Moving costs from the standing costs to running costs has the benefit of helping to change the economic argument for driving - if we take the AA-derived £25 total costs figure again, and change it from being £12-£16 running costs, £9 to £13 share of standing charges, to £20 to £22 running costs, £3 to £5 standing charges, the train begins to look better.",0,1332596592,null,0,true,0,c44fniq,t3_rb6aq,t1_c44fniq,t1_c44f69q,null,1428585059,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He said it, the owners said it, the players said it. Failure is nothing, if not the inability to achieve your goals. The Carling Cup is nice, but it's not really indicative of success in anything but that competiton. Just ask Birmingham. I grew up supporting this team during a period of unparalleled greatness, and until we return to that glory, **no season will be good enough.**

But here is the thing, **LFC would gain nothing from sacking KD.** Fault the team for missed chances, for poor finishing, for defensive meltdowns, but getting rid of Kenny has no upside. While it makes me feel ill that we are only 3 points above Swansea and we could potentially have our worst league performance in my 28 years supporting the club, getting rid of Kenny isn't going to change the course of this season. It's been a disappointing one, but it's over. We focus on the positives, take pride in our cup performance and figure out where things have gone wrong. I still have faith that Kenny can do that and so do the overwhelming amount of supporters (a luxury that Hodgson didn't enjoy). I will undoubtedly moan about some of his decisions. I will continue to slate some of his transfers, but I still haven't thought for a second that we need to look elsewhere. Next season should bring better results and I remain confident that Kenny can do that.

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"It doesn't matter in the world of soundbites though. It's not like they are going to publish the full survey results. They are going to pick results that reinforce whatever story they want to sell. e.g. 57% of respondents rated Cameron as competent or trustworthy (while omitting that the only answers were positive), while only 10% of respondents identified Miliband as Charismatic, (omitting that instead 38% rated him as ""in touch with the common people""). Or vice versa if the paper leans the other way. It can be swung however you like it.

Even if a negative version of the question exists, it'll be used exactly the same way. In fact that is possibly even more disingenuous. Present the best positive result of the party you like, and the worst negative of the party you don't. And it's easy to do so in a way that leads the reader to assume the responses are to the same question.

Meaningful stats almost can't be gathered from a questionnaire like that. 100% of people have to rate each candidate as positive, and 100% (if the questions you suggest are present) have to rate them as negative. The paper then gets to pick and choose how to present the results as it chooses. The only way it could be useful is to compare the the full results of the survey, but you know as well as I do that thats not how the press works.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","My car's fixed costs (insurance, maintenance, depreciation assuming it lasts until it's ten years old) work out to about £8/day. My fuel costs me 9.1p/km (I track this), and my commute is 84 km round trip (45 minutes door-to-door each way), for a total cost of £15/day.

To do the same commute by public transport would take longer (timetabled time is 1½ hours each way) if the buses and trains kept to timetable. If either the bus or the train runs late (and one of the two does most days), it takes an extra hour each leg, so it's typically 3 hours a day more.

The bus component of the commute would work out to around £2/day on a season pass. The train component is around £10/day, for £12/day total.

*However*, if I'd not bought a comfortable car brand new, the fixed costs would be lower - I could have halved my fixed costs by choosing a cheaper, less comfortable car, and reduced my fuel costs to boot. Alternatively, I could make the train part of my journey comparable in comfort levels to my car, by going for first class, which works out to £22/day for the train component, for £24/day total.

If you look at my previous car's costs, my fixed costs worked out at about £3/day. My fuel (adjusted to today's prices) cost me 9.1p/km, reducing the total cost to £10/day. Even standard class isn't economic against that.

So, I get first-class level comfort for a little more than the price of a standard class annual season ticket. I spend less half the time commuting by road that I would use commuting by train. And I have the flexibility of having a car available for impromtu journeys, rather than having to hire a car.

Edit: Change train prices to be based against an annual ticket, not a monthly - assumes you have £3k up front for standard class, or about the cost of buying and insuring my previous car.",0,1332600368,null,0,false,0,c44g0kp,t3_rb6aq,t1_c44g0kp,t1_c44ezv4,null,1428585247,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If you are on a left-persuasion, do not like the Left and take your vote to, the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Pirate Party, the Monster Raving Looney Party, the Science Party, the Respect Party, the new Liberal Party, the Green Party (with the exception of Brighton Pavillion) - remember this those in the country with a right-wing agenda **are not playing by the same rules**. 

Look at the conservative party in the whole, you have a Pro-European side, an anti-European side. Those who are pro-Hayek, and those who attend Taleb lectures. David Davis vs David Cameron. They have politicians in that party with exactly as diverse views on for instance Green Energy policy as a Green Party politician and a Labour party one, the difference is, the conservatives are in one party and they do not have a vote to split. 

Look at the Hunting Lobby, if they took a leaf out of the Left's book, pro-Hunt supporters would form their own political party, a ""Hunt Party"" or ""Countryside Party"" etc and run against the Conservatives in core heartlands.  Instead, the Hunting lobby, campaign for the Conservative party in their core constituencies. 

You may argue, look at UKIP. Well, here is the thing, whatever they say on the Telegraph Comment section, if it was between a Ukip candidate and a Conservative Candidate, they would vote Conservative. That is why Nigel Farage lost an election against Bercow (the most left Conservative if there ever was one). Why they have more MEPs than MPs. And why Peter Hitchens does not have a hope in his ideal Conservative Party ever happening.  

That is why, really when you are voting for a left wing candidate for a minority party you are most likely chucking a vote to the right-wing one. That is how messed up our political representation system is. But the wider truth is this, unity is power.

When you use the term CUNT at someone or passingly it never refers to the actual object anymore, well not usually. It just shows a gauge of anger, or other emotions. It might actually have that meaning if someone called someone a 'vagina face', or that someone has a 'drooping labia neck'. It just seems that most of the traditional swear words are offensive just for the sake of being offensive.

Roads are paid for out of general taxation. Motoring reciepts such as fuel duty and VED don't come close to covering the costs. Motor vehicles cause nearly all the wear. There are also vast costs from ""accidents"". The tax payer also has to pay out hundreds of millions in fines to the EU for the air pollution that motorists inflict on the rest of the population. Not to mention costs to the NHS for the thousands of people killed or seriously injured by cars, plus the tens of thousands of air-pollution related illnesses. There's also indirect costs like oil-related wars.

Kenny obviously isn't big on tactics. We really haven't had much strategy this season, and especially in the past couple games. A good manager would know how to rotate his players well so he doesn't have to start basically the same 11 three times in six days. He doesn't have the right to blame tiredness for the loss. Instead, he should blame his lack of tactics and the lack of a good rotation.

Honestly, we would have had a much better chance today if we had played the younger players Like Sterling and Shelvey from the beginning. Throughout the game, Flano was the only one who looked like he had any energy.

That said, the ethos of qualifications has changed drastically in the last 30 years. For instance, at no point in my studies (through school and university) did any of my coursework ever count towards my final grade - it was all on examination results.

Yes losing Lucas obviously hurts the team, no one can deny that. Remember the first fixture against Man City when he shadowed Silva the whole game and shut him down? Not many players could take on a task like that.

Remember Gerrard's return after the ankle business against Blackburn? He came off the bench and the team looked completely different, more energetic and more spry.

Suarez's return also has been huge as well. While his first game or two he looked a little flat, he immediately picked it up again and has created countless chances for the team that don't show up in the stats (creating these chances and not finishing goes with our continuing problem of not finishing).

Also we are forgetting the HUGE performances Craig Bellamy put in during Suarez's absence, and right now we are missing a player like him very badly.

Honestly, I think most of our problems lie with the squad and their performance, not the manager. But I think Kenny needs to stop coddling the team and lay down the bottom line: Win games and show good effort or you do not belong at Liverpool. The effort hurts me far more than the results do. 

Kenny is a living legend, and we know he is a great motivator. We finished last season so strong under his leadership. The players gushed about how his management style was such a refreshing change of pace. I think he needs to send the ship rocking a bit more - things are too stable and predictable.

Actually, we were not simply aiming at 4th position when the season started. Well, we were but there was a slight difference here. FSG said it's unrealistic to aim straight for something like title this season so we should be getting atleast 4th. And thus we would be in a position for pushing for the title later. So 4th was the *minimum* target we should've achieved to get to title.

That means even if we just misses out 4th and finishes 5th or 6th. But this right now is pathetic. Now I think, unless we win that FA cup and finish 7th there is no reason for Kenny to continue. I am not saying we should sack kenny tonight. But the right thing to do, if we dont even have an FA cup and sits below 7th with a 100m out of our pocket is to move on at the end of the season.

This is why our mighty defence has suddenly collapsed. Carra is not done, but Agger and Skrtel are both better now.

Plus any mention of relatives sets people off. That coupled with the fact that Jenny, Alex, and a supposed great-great-granddaughter reference characters specific to other stories (one very obscure) means that it will have less emotional significance to the general audience (which is where DW gets its money).

Even big fans of the show don't know that the Doctor has a great-grandson. And that's only if you're a fan who subscribes to the Big Finish audio dramas as canonical.

It's risky with him because he doesn't contribute much other than the odd goal and if were looking at an off Drogba were basically fucked. Torres should at least be able to setup something up against Benfica. Here is the lineup I would like to see:

Cech

Ivan Cahill/Luiz Luiz/Terry Cole

Mikel Lampard

Sturridge Mata Ramires

Torres

Our back four has been good so I don't really care who plays. Mikel has been great so he should definitely play. Sturridge looked better today playing some one time passes and such but now we can play him on his preferred side. Mata self-explanatory. And I expect Benfica will push up a bit being at home so it would be nice to have Ramires on the counter attack and to give Mata and Lampard some breathing room and because Benfica attack mostly down their right side.

Unfortunately those two things are areas that we've struggled greatly in this year.

Right now he is having to both create and finish chances, something that is very difficult to do when you're the focus of the defense. 

I tend to think that we should play Downing on the left, Carroll and Suarez in the middle, Sterling on the right, and Henderson/Jonjo, Gerrard, and Spearing in the midfield for the rest of the EPL season. Let's give those players (Henderson-Downing-Carroll-Suarez-Gerrard) a chance to gel, and give some younger players (Jonjo, Sterling, Spearing) a chance.

Hell, Mel suddenly dropping in all ""oh, she's totally been here the whole time"" pretty much proves that not every plot element is planned ahead of time.

I'm an *enormous* fan of LOST, trust me. I know when a writer plans things ahead of time and I know when they're flying by the seat of their pants. Moffat's good, but he's far from the mastermind some fans seem to make him out to be.

Further, I think the better explanation is [Rekku_Prometheus's theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/rc0a0/mirrored_sunglasses/c44lmvp) that only a direct image that has seen, literally *seen*, the eyes of an Angel can become an Angel.

This leads me to think Moffat's hint is telling us that one of the following is true:

A.) The new companion is not human.
B.) The new companion is not from our (the viewers) time, possibly she's from the future or past, or even an alternate future or past.
C.) He meets her somewhere in outerspace, implying she has the capable of space travel herself.

Those are the obvious ones I can think of. Oh and of course:

D.) All of the above.

She could also be from an alternate universe, another version of River Song, or any number of random things that would be new for companions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; On the other hand, due to the adoption of earlier Norman settlers into the Irish population, there is an element of Norman heritage to the ethnic Irish population. Plantation descendants obviously are mainly of English and Scottish heritage.

There are different ethnic groups, yes, but interesting *genetically* Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English people are all part of the same genetic group; a single population which has inhabitated the British isles for thousands of years. The latest research indicates that approximately 80% of white people in Britain and Ireland are the descendents of a single group of a few thousand hunter gatherers who migrated to the British and Irish peninsula, which were back then connected, at the end of the last ice age. Later migrations from other groups had very little impact upon this population genetically. The Celts for example had a mostly cultural, not genetic impact upon the population of Ireland. 

&gt; ""There's been a lot of arguing over the last ten years, but it's now more or less agreed that about 80 percent of Britons' genes come from hunter-gatherers who came in immediately after the Ice Age,"" Miles said. 

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0719_050719_britishgene.html

&gt; Britain and Ireland are so thoroughly divided in their histories that there is no single word to refer to the inhabitants of both islands. Historians teach that they are mostly descended from different peoples: the Irish from the Celts, and the English from the Anglo-Saxons who invaded from northern Europe and drove the Celts to the country’s western and northern fringes.

&gt; But geneticists who have tested DNA throughout the British Isles are edging toward a different conclusion. Many are struck by the overall genetic similarities, leading some to claim that both Britain and Ireland have been inhabited for thousands of years by a single people that have remained in the majority, with only minor additions from later invaders like Celts, Romans, Angles , Saxons, Vikings and Normans.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Silhouetted starkly against the setting western sun we see a cactus and tumbleweed set against a wide-spanning and barren desert. 

We hear an American black man with the slightest touch of a Southern accent saying ""Our father...""

An early lamppost's lightbulb blasts out in a loud spark in the streets of a midday old west town. The streets are barren.
 
Hanging under wooden gate perched with the classic bleached bull-skull is chained a battered wooden sign for the town reading ""MERCY"". Underneath the printed word lies, in chalk, the word ""six"".

""...who art in heaven..."" the man continues in overvoice.

Stomping across a wooden porch of the town we see the heavy black boots of a dark stranger as he strides with slow purpose forward.

We see the back of the head of this stranger. He wears a heavy duster and a wide brimmed hat. The back of his neck is heavy with many-chinned contusions.

The strangers face, pale and thick, covered in mechanical augments along the face and neck, most apparent of which is a massive robotic lens replacing his right eye. The socket glows blue and is vaugely reminiscent of the stalk of a Dalek.

We see the overvoice speaking. He stands in front of a scattered group of town residents, standing dumbfounded in the middle of the town's road. He's well dressed in starched suit and tie and himself wears a hat. He perhaps is the town's historically inaccurate town leader. He stoically continues ""...thy kingdom come...""

We see the Doctor wearing his favorite stetson with his right hand cooly in his pocket staring down at the dirt with a pick in his teeth. An opponent steps in and frames his figure between his legs in the iconic western style.

The Doctor looks up to his opponent with a grimace. He stands outside the clocktower of the town labeled ""GRAND CENTRAL"".

""...thy will be done...""

The Doctor stand across from the cyborg in the center of town, nothing but dust between the two of the mas they stare off at each other.

We see a close shot of the cyborg's face as he looks outward intimidatingly in a sweep as he bellows ""FACE ME!"". His teeth are surprisingly a pearly white.

We see the Doctor, in the same town but now at night looking out at the camera. Behind him are Amy and Rory and a handful of the town's denizens as they stand in the middle of the dirt road. He says with fearful urgency ""Run!"".

The theme ""Every Planet, Every Star"" kicks in. The following scenes coincide with the score's stabs of the trumpet.

We see a window shatters open as reddish light and a strong gust of wind blast forth with a roar.

Now day again in the town we see a man in a brown coat ducking and lifting his arms in instinctive defense as a shot narrowly misses his head and hits into the wooden wall behind him in an explosion of dust.

In town center, still midday, the cyborg points forward his canon-like arm like a junkyard Megaman as a window across from him explodes in a shower of broken glass.

We see a man in a tweed coat and a hat cover his head as he awkwardly runs alongside the dirt to dodge something. He flings his hands up like an idiot and given that he's outside the Grand Central I mentioned earlier, this is almost certainly the Doctor again.

In the middle of the desert there a towering orange explosion as if it were made by TNT or dynamite. Nothing else, just an explosion.

We see probably-Rory running alongside a portly mustachioed man in a bowler cap across the desert towards the camera.

We again see the portly man and probably-Rory walking across rocky terrain alongside a white cliff face when an explosion blasts in between the two of them, throwing up a blast of dirt.

An explosion tosses up more dirt, but this time from a lower angle.

An explosion of sparks lights up the dark. A small ring of blue lights can bee seen where the right eye of a difficult to discern figure would be who seems to be creating the sparks. My moneys on it being the cyborg.

Suddenly it's day *in the arctic tundra* and the Doctor is sprinting forward followed by probably-Rory and a figure in a full body white tundra suit.

The Doctor, probably-Rory, and the white-clad figure are specks on a sweeping arctic landscape.

Back to the Old West probably the Doctor chases a tall, dark probably-the-cyborg across a flat plateau dotted with dry yellowed grass.

We see Amy in a white blue-striped shirt running at night in what appears to be a modern city, possibly London's Underground. She quickly looks behind her to glimpse her pursuers.

Still at night, but in what appears to be a cemetery or something we see four figures running to camera. One is a woman in a white dress and two are holding flashlights. Their garb appears to be modern-day.

The Doctor, probably-Rory and some balding red-headed bloke run *away* from camera towards a bleak rocky cliff face that stretches on across the beach. They head away from a rocky shore, the sky looks a bleak grey.

We see another shot of the red-headed bloke running alongside the beach he turns back in wide-eyed panic. He's wearing a black vest and wristwatch and apparently has a goatee. Probably Rory's sprinting beside him in yellow shorts.

We see the Doctor's feet sliding on ice (or something) lit by colored lights, maybe he's at a skating rink, I don't know. But he's having trouble keeping balance.

We see the Doctor, still in the ice-rink-thing, making a funny face as he slides forward, trying to keep his balance.

The camera is facing up at a beautiful blue sky dotted with clouds as the Doctor and Amy rush up to inspect it. It being the camera.

We see a figure that appears to be the cyborg in a dark room, possibly a church judging by the stained slass pane on the wall behind him marching forward with his menacing canon-arm (producing a menacing circular ring of lights), blue eye a-glowin'.

We see the townsfolk positively pissing their pants in the pews of the church as they scream at the off-screen location the cyborg would be.

We see a little girl in a red room scream. There's a banister behind her and her garb appears to be.. I dunno... Victorian? I'm no dress expert, and that kid is *screaming*.

We see a buxom bartender/burlesque dancer/prostitute behind the bar of a saloon, bottle of alcohol lining the wall behind her. The Doctor is leaning over the bar and she is seductively sticking something in her mouth. Suddenly both her and the Doctor look to someone entering the bar in surprise.

We see the town center with people bustling about, mostly shouting and yelling in panic. Lots of yelling and running in this segment.

Another shot of villagers panicking and running about, this time with what appears to be an elderly blacksmith panicking in the foreground.

Said elderly blacksmith takes a dive and bellyflops on the dirt like a fucking grenades about to blow, but he lands painfully.

The Doctor, against all of his codes of ethics and morality, is pointing a gun just offscreen as townspeople with moustaches stand behind him.

Amy, standing across from the Doctor in what appears to be the same spot as the last scene gesticulates with a revolver with a level of idiotic carelessness that mirrors her respect to the danger of swords, says ""Have you been taking stupid lessons since I last saw you!?"" much in the way a middle-school girl would insult one of their friends if they weren't terribly bright. 

The gun goes off and she nearly shoots a dude in the foot.

Towns people raise their hands with the sort of immediate shock one responds to when someone crazy has a *fucking gun*.

Mr. Monopoly shouts ""What's wrong with you!?"" to Amy as if anyone has the time to sit down and explain all that.

A Sheriff with a Fu Manchu announces ""Everyone who isn't an American, *drop your gun* as he accusatorily points directly at Amy.

Instead of *dropping the damn gun* Amy gestures with it and fires off another shot, causing the surrounding townspeople to cringe in shock. She shouts ""I didn't mean to do that."" and looks around with an obnoxious ""listen guys, I'm explaining"" shrug. She doesn't put down the gun because *she's a goddamn idiot*.

About six of the townspeople seem to have grabbed the Doctor like the least friendly form of crowd surfing possible and are running him to the edge of town. The Doctor is going ""WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA!"" as they do this.

They uncerimoniously toss him outside of said bull-skull clad gate.

We see the Doctor stand up with a pained look on his face.

We then see virtually every patron of the town pull out and cock their revolvers, pointing it directly at the camera.

The Doctor, Amy, and Rory are having a dandy little jaunt along the town's streets when a lamppost explodes in a shower of sparks.

I don't know why I like or managed to get into classic Who. I didn't even think old tv was worth watching until I tried classic. Now I can watch other movies/shows from ages ago without bias!

Which was why the 10th Doctor was in a lot of pain when finally visiting Rose before regenerating.

Also, there were no adventures between The Eleventh Hour and The Beast Below, as Amy was in her nightie for that, no adventures between  The Beast Below and Victory of the Daleks, as there was a little cliffhanger at the end of The Beast Below linking the two episodes together. Plus these episodes were in Amy's first few days of adventuring, so I find it unlikely that the 11th Doctor would dump her and have a picnic with River Song, who he barely knew and had no way of contacting.

It's night ans we see (possibly) the cyborg (and another cyborg?) being built in the dark, their forms hung up crucificially as welding sparks fly from their sides.

The Doctor peers into the dark investigatively.

He sees two giant robo-things about ten feet tall standing immobile in the dark. A hunched old man with a can stand beside them and the Doctor steps forward to take a look.

For a split second we see a very pale man with black hair, most of his face obscured by a thingy and scar-like markings all over his face. He makes a stabbing motion at a pharaoh-dressed man with a black thingy with a red light on it.

Tutankhamen is chocked as the pincer-like black thing wraps it's claws around his neck.

Someone who looks suspiciously like Argus Filch looks down at something in the most evil way possible. He is wearing ridiculously pointy shoulder things and I guess has a cape.

A dude in a military haircut shakes around in his sleeping bag as what appears to be a giant lifelike Buzz Lightyear floats around behind him in a non-focused blur.

Amy in the same white-with-blue-stripes shirt now stand back-to-bak with some guy. Both of them have shotguns and both are cocking them like it looks badass. She looks kind of frightened. It is night.

Back to the western town at day, the Doctor rides past, stetson on head, on a horse.

A white suited dude (perhaps *the* white suited figure from earlier), stands up from a crouched position alone in the arctic. He pulls up his hood to reveal he's a bald black dude. He looks out seemingly amazed.

Doctor on a horse, *but shot from behind*.

Doctor on a horse, *but shot from far away at the side*.

A balding red-headed dude, (possibly *the* balding red-headed dude from earlier) steps up to a guy in a suit looking as confused as the viewer must be. It night and behind him are moving things that are large that if I had to name them I'd probably say they're horses.

The cyborg stands tall in the town's square, wearing a dark poncho like some cyberpunk Clint Eastwood, look as goddamn badass as humanly possible.

Amy turns to the camera with a stupid look on her face. It is such a close up I cannot really tell where she is, only that she probably does't understand something going on.

The doctor, in the desert, holds up his hands in surrender with an hurriedly placating look on his face like that of a man who doesn't want to get shot in the dick.

A pudgy, balding, middle aged red-head (maybe *this* is the red-head from earlier? He looks more like him than that other guy,) is running and looks over his shoulder to the audience. He has the single most unbecoming facial tattoo in existence.

Badass cyborg dude points his glowing canon-arm at the camera...*at night*.

The Doctor, in steton, prepares to sit down in the western town at night. He says ""give me a Dalek any day"", in a semi-sarcastic tone like that of someone who has forgotten how fucking terrifying goddamn Daleks are.

Something black and metallic arises from the arctic tundra with an alien whirrum.

We see the Doctor's face taking up the whole screen and lying on his side. He makes a face like Marty McFly having just been hit in the head by a guy named 3D.

We see what the metallic thing was as it turns to face the camera. Covered in snow but unmistakably there it is *a Dalek eyestalk* (this is Moffat-style Dalek eyestalk, I'm afraid, so get used to pastel color-coding again).

The cyborg (in the same shot where he was pointing his badass arm-canon at the camera) now fires a ring of blinding blue energy with an alien brzzooo!

Suddenly no one remembered him other than River, but the world didn't change to one where he'd never existed.  He wasn't unwritten, only everyone's awareness of him.

Also, when the universe restarted, it was restarted from the memories of Amy...who had spent her whole life sleeping next to a crack, and her brain being filled with all kinds of things that shouldn't have been there.

true,flapjowls,null,null,"As somebody who has played at a relatively competitive level Liverpool's season is the type that builds character, understanding, and cohesion.  It's Kenny's first full season after mopping up the carpetbagger's mess.  He's got some new young talent in, but we all know full well it's nowhere near a complete team.  If the powers that be can be patient and not get all Abromavich when shit goes wrong I'm sure we'll be seeing him sign a few more players to fill in roles that need filling.  We won't be seeing him sign every hot player available for stupid wages.  This season has all the signs of a maiden voyage (on a ship that's been dry-docked).  He was never going to put this team out on the pitch and have them looking like one of his teams of old.  He's had to clean up a big mess.   

I played in the US at my university in the division II level (division I being the highest).  We had a couple of seasons during my earlier years where we were a young and raw team.  Most of us never played together and the coaches ways of doing things were new to us.  As those early seasons wore on and all our hard work didn't bare fruit it was easy to grow frustrated and lose concentration particularly for us younger guys.  Sometimes there was a 'what's-the-point' attitude.  As a few seasons went by I noticed how playing seemed to just start to flow.  The coaches methods started sinking in.  We started having a much better more coherent understanding on the pitch.  Most importantly though, was our mentality had changed.  Through constant repetition and a slowly built understanding we started to believe in what we were doing.  It sounds simple to build belief and team chemistry, but in my playing experience that's the toughest part of a team to build.  I can't imagine how tough it is for a Premier League manager to achieve that. 

My main point is that this Liverpool team truly is a long term project.  Don't be dragged down by the poison the media spreads.  Shut them out of your minds.  They create this bipolar fan culture.  They just want to sell bullshit week in week out and that's it.  I'm blown away at how many people get sucked in by it.  Also, put City and Chelsea and United  and the top four and Champions League and all the other distractions out of you minds.  Instead put your support behind the team, but be aware that growing pains will happen especially this season.  You don't have to always like what you see, but realize this is the very beginning of a new project.  Look for game by game positives and I have feeling we'll be seeing those positives translate into more success in the next few seasons.

TL;DR... sorry for the pep talk.  Basically, in my playing experience a team is built over a period of seasons, not five game chunks.  Let this current project work it's course.  Don't be sucked in by the media's bipolar inducing need to sell you bullshit.

There has to be balance.  There've been cases of Jainist animal centres in India keeping animals in severe untreatable pain alive because they refuse to use euthanasia.  You can't explain treatments and pain to animals so there have to be limits to the discomforts and indignities you make them suffer in the name of a cure (or just keeping them alive).  With companion animals people have to be self-aware enough to know whether they're seeking treatment for their own selfish interests or in the genuine best interests of their pet, and with uncared for and wild animals it's easier to be clear-headed about it (so long as you genuinely care for the animals and there are no significant financial pressures).",0,1332691185,null,0,false,0,c44rbc5,t3_rckwo,t1_c44rbc5,t1_c44qs54,null,1428590602,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Liverpool (All Comps): P40 Win%=50, Points Per Game = 1.78

Carroll starts: P22 W13 D5 L4, Win%=59, Points Per Game = 2.00
Carroll doesn’t start: P18 W7 D6 L5, Win%=39, Points Per Game = 1.50

In terms of ‘difficulty’:

Carroll starts vs Teams higher in PL than Liverpool (All Comps v Arsenal, Chelsea, City, United, Newcastle, Spurs)
P8 W5 D1 L2, Win%=63, Points Per Game = 2.00

Carroll starts vs “the rest”
P14 W8 D4 L2, Win%=57, Points Per Game = 2.00

No Carroll start vs Teams higher
P6 W1 D3 L2, Win%=17, Points Per Game = 1.00

No Carroll start vs “the rest”
P12 W6 D3 L3, Win%=50, Points Per Game = 1.75

FSG, Kenny and the players all made it clear that Champion's League qualification was the #1 goal this season. Now that we all see that was a fantasy, the apologists want to move the goal posts and pat Kenny on the back? 

Further troubling is that our most of our new investments actually aren't improving in the way that should be expected. In fact, they are performing worse than they did at their previous clubs. There are many ways to judge improvement, obviously, but one only needs to look around the league to find players of comparable ages (who often cost less) who are showing what can be done for a ""developing player"". 

Now even *if* we should be expected to accept that this team is not being mismanaged, but only ""redeveloped"", we still need reasonable expectations and benchmarks. One only needs to look at Newcastle as an example of how far behind the curve this club is. Alan Pardew took over at roughly the same time as Dalglish, and despite only being recently relegated, losing their top scorer and not having the financial resources of this club, have found themselves in a position to play in the Champion's League.

An apology was demanded of Rush and he offered a half-assed ""I regret the use of two words"" apology (meaning ""prostitute"" and ""slut"") but never once apologized for the sentiment, which to some was the bigger issue.

The obvious difference here is that you have celebrities and politicians -- people who by the level of their fame are libel proof in the American legal system -- all quibbling about offense. However, the invocation of Sandra Fluke, a private citizen, could be considered libel. Because Rush claimed that he was using hyperbole to draw attention to a ridiculous situation, would Mitchell also say that the outrage caused by it was also by the alliance of stupid and the opportunistic since they didn't see the context that Rush was trying to construct?

American history leave open a vast swath of possible periods and ""feels"" for an episode. A western is a common genre that comes with brilliant iconography and is the most obvious choice for a time-travelling episode.

If the writers want a western, they have to place it in the U.S., plain and simple. Maybe they're doing it to please American audiences, but I doubt it. The last episode in America was the lowest watched pilot Doctor Who has *ever* had *and* was met with critical derision.

It's well known that's how FSG runs their sports clubs and besides, they really didn't have a choice but to redevelop after Hicks and Gillette.  Yes, Champions League qualification was certainly set as a season goal, but nobody ever guaranteed it.  People saw it written and stated at the beginning of the season and assumed it was in the bag.  I remember much being made of the 'feel good' factor around the club during the early part of the season.  It was as if everyone assumed since the team was feeling good and playing some good football that this season was going to be a breeze.  To me that demonstrated how emotions always get the better of the fans, and I believe the media have become masters at manipulating fans emotions (hence bipolar).  That's why I urged taking an even keel approach as a fan and not getting caught up in hype, positive or negative.  Also be careful looking at other teams and comparing.  Every team is different and their fortunes should also be looked at long term as well.  One good season can give way to mediocrity the next then even relegation beyond that.  In Newcastle's case I think the hawks will be flying overheard ready to swoop for somebody like Ba.  Newcastle don't exactly have a history of retaining their star players when big money is being dangled.  

Don't get me wrong though, I'm not blindly optimistic.  I fully recognize the team have been well below their potential.  I personally didn't think at any point the team was going to qualify for CL this season.  Everything was (and still is) raw and I believe the team is missing a few more players to add versatility and depth.    

To answer your last question, I don't know at what point it can be concluded that it isn't working, but I do know that right now it's too early to come to such a conclusion.

That means that everyone in the world is now able to use many times the levels of energy that they currently use. Heating and lighting your home costs 1/1000th of your income, rather than 1/50th; fuel costs become nominal, so, apart from buying and insuring the equipment, it's more or less free to travel around by cars or planes. Even the equipment itself becomes cheaper, because of embodied energy costs in its manufacture. Suddenly desalination of water becomes accessible, so you can irrigate deserts, turn them into land for growing food, and food costs go down again. And so on.

These sorts of changes are happening all the time. 1000 years ago all books were copied out by hand. 200 years ago the typesetting for printing would have been done by hand, and each sheet individually pressed, 50 years ago typesetting was done by hand, but printing was roll to roll, and the pressing done by machines. 20 years ago, typesetting was automated on computer. Now, we have e-readers, that can use digital files, which can be copied for free. At each stage, people have lost their jobs (hand scribes, manual labour in printing works, typographers, and soon, many workers in print factories), and yet, now one person is capable of producing thousands of copies of a piece of textual information by ctrl-c and ctrl-v, where previously it would have taken millions of hours of labour.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"&gt; Sure it was sold as long term redevelopment.

Absolute bullshit. [Here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/aug/02/john-henry-liverpool-champions-league) is John W. Henry's view on the subject at the start of the season, ""It's too early for us to talk about winning the league,"" said Henry according to reports on Monday. ""[But] **our main goal is to qualify for the Champions League. If we don't, it would be a major disappointment.**""

The primary goal of this season was CL football. Don't delude yourself in to thinking otherwise. He didn't say, ""Champions League Qualification in five years and if we have our worst season in decades, it will be okay."" No one is suggesting a guarantee, there is no such thing in football.

&gt; To answer your last question, I don't know at what point it can be concluded that it isn't working,

This is the difficult question. I suppose it comes down to whether you think that we've shown acceptable, worthwhile progress. I do not view the Carling Cup alone as creating a worthwhile season (just ask Birmingham). To that end, you must judge the progress of his purchases. Clearly, that has been disappointing. 

&gt; It would be a tragedy to pull the plug after this season and frankly it looks bad when teams go the route of Chelsea.

'Speculation on players shouldn't include those of a certain age, we are not going to be successful by merely filling short-term needs at LFC.'

John Henry on Twitter


""Comolli has a track record of identifying players. He isn’t afraid to spend big and take a gamble (Bale?). It is his role to take a 5 year view on a player; how good they are right now is important, but the critical factor is how good they can be in 3-5 years. That is where the criticism of Carroll and Henderson becomes redundant, both players have the attributes, but both are still in a phase of development.""

[http://www.thisisanfield.com/2012/03/the-comolli-role/](http://www.thisisanfield.com/2012/03/the-comolli-role/)



I was being a little flippant when I say 5 years, but realistically if you look at the players that Comolli brought into Spurs (he arrived there in 2005 and left in Oct 2008), it's only now (4-7 years later) that Spurs look like being able to contend for the league title.

And realistically we *were* in the running for 4th place until the (unlucky) defeat to Arsenal on 3rd March. In fact I did see interviews with players saying after that match that we still weren't out of the race for 4th, but I think that match knocked that on the head. Not January. There's about 20 points we've dropped where we've been dominant in a match or in dominant positions in matches. I honestly don't think we're that far away, maybe strengthening in a couple of areas, from being a top 4 side. Of course it's disappointing not to qualify for the CL, it also sets us back and limits the quality of players we can sign (in terms of wage bill and being able to offer CL football).

However, to challenge for the league, we'll need 2-3 of our younger players to develop into world beaters, and that will take about.... 5 years.",0,1332712812,null,0,false,0,c44v2io,t3_rbu7j,t1_c44v2io,t1_c44txbq,null,1435727541,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt; The average citizen's ability to influence government and society.

That works both ways. In theory an American voter should feel disenfranchised because he is voting for a leader who represents 300 million rather than 60 million people, but in practice that leader wields so much power that the voter feels (or certainly should feel) much more important. Americans vote not just on their own affairs, but on the affairs of the world. Also, to be less brutalist about it, you should be able to structure political systems so that power goes to the appropriate levels, trade negotiation gets passed up to the regional/European level, defense remains a national issue, education and policing is local, and so on (I.e. the subsidiarity concept). As a side point, you might say that in an ideal world trade rules should be the same for everyone, decided by some global voting system, rather than by the clashing of powerful blocs, who ultimately use their power to bully others.

&gt; Abundant natural resources and their derivative products.

There are of course limits here of some degree, but they can be subverted in various ways. If you're talking about something like, say, Aluminium, there's clearly a limited amount of ore in the ground, so you can't build unlimited quantities of, er, Aluminium planes. But you can subvert the limit, firstly by using the material only in places where it is most valuable, so using it in planes, but not in crisp packets. Secondly by developing other materials with similar or better properties (the 787 is made with carbon fibre, not Aluminium). Thirdly by recycling Aluminium which has been thrown away (as we do with cans). On the last point, it might well end up that we don't have a limit in one-time consumption of Aluminium, but rather a limit in the total amount in distribution, which can be switched from one use to another as the need dictates, rather like when we tore down all the iron railings in Britain, and made Spitfires out of them, then after the war melted down the fighter planes, and remade iron railings. 

&gt; Land, houses, in locations we want.

It's ultimately true that there are limits on land, but, again, there are various caveats. Of course you can always have more high density housing, but the most pressing reason for scarcity is that only a very small amount of the land in Britain is used for housing at present, because of the confluence of various problems, and vested interests:

* Food security - At the moment Britain could just about support its population using British farmland. We're understandably not keen to pass that limit. However, farming yields are not fixed, we've seen something like fivefold increases over the last thirty years. One way which has been pursued to increase yields further is hydroponics within greenhouses. For instance, there's an astonishing project in Kent, known as [Thanet Earth](http://www.kentonline.co.uk/thanet_extra/news/2011/january/11/giant_greenhouses_win_award.aspx), which uses waste heat from a local power plant to keep massive greenhouses at tropical temperatures, and powerplant CO2 emissions to increase crop yields. In the long term, cheap energy will definitely mean wildly higher yields, which should open up more land for residential development.

* Other environmental concerns, around urban sprawl and the maintenance of the countryside, which are fully justified.

* People who own houses have a vested interest in preventing further development, in order to push up the value of their houses, to produce artificial wealth for themselves. That becomes a particular problem when a majority of the population at the level where planning decisions are made are homeowners. And is made worse by politicians deliberately trying to create a 'property owning democracy'.

I think in the long term you could extend residential land without getting urban sprawl, if you were careful about planning, and if you weren't bothered about food security (perhaps you'd trust that we could get food from Europe) or if we could increase crop yields in Britain. Also assuming you can dodge the politics.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1332725508,null,0,false,0,c44xdyl,t3_rdhku,t1_c44xdyl,t3_rdhku,null,1428593505,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

In which case, the sentiment was offensive, not the out-of-context interpretation of the words, right? What are your thoughts?

I think that people probably should not have to apologize for their opinions, but I also believe that some opinions that are from the fringe groups -- groups that I would normally expect to be marginalized and hedged out of common discourse because of how unsavory/repulsive they are and for how few people *truly* believe those things -- are brought to the center of discourse or are disproportionately loud because the very few people who believe them are also equipped or wealthy enough to disseminate those ideas.

Also, it could be my own viewpoint about this, but Limbaugh didn't have sponsors begin to drop him like a syringe filled with AIDS until consumers began complaining to the companies that were advertising with them. NOW those companies get to claim the moral high ground and say they don't want to be associated with his vitriol. Until the consumers got organized to complain, no corporation pulled their ads...

I say: Rory chose to stay behind. Also Rory was with people, got to experience the world, and was made of plastic so things probably didn't bother him as much, physically.

On the other hand, Amy was unwillingly abandoned and she was attacked and under threat of death every day, and probably the worst of all- she was completely alone. No human contact at all. That's like the people version of sensory deprivation. And a person's brain starts to deteriorate if you stay in a sensory deprivation chamber for over an hour or two. Imagine a lifetime. (think Davros, Big Finish, if it helps)

Amy thought she was going to die there alone and old, Rory knew he would survive to see Amy again. And he was ""with"" Amy the whole time.

They may have promised to come for Amy, but when the Doctor has a time machine, wouldn't you start to wonder why they didn't come for you pretty soon after you got stuck? 36 years inside your own head could drive you nuts.
