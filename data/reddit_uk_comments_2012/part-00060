If the situation does call for physical intervention I'm not going to stop anyone and 100% support their right to defend themselves.

Levy seems to drag his feet and try for the best deal possible, admirable as that is we need to be able to make moves rapidly to make sure other teams don't jump into the bidding.

We need to accept that we will likely lose Modders.  If we get an offer in the 35-40mil range pull the trigger. Preferably to a team outside of England.  

We may lose Bale, i prefer us to take the stance with Bale this year that we took with Modric if it comes to it.  Keep him around for at least one more year.  Draw the line in the sand and either declare he isn't going anywhere or make the price so high that if someone does jump they effectively fund 2 purchases.

Drop the deadwood,  Jenas, Gomes, Bentley, Bassong, Khumalo, Dos Santos, Corluka and maybe Pienaar...don't hold out for every penny, if you get a solid offer take it and put it towards some quality that we will use.

Make smart moves, look at Newcastle....they made smart moves, Ba on free, Cabaye and Santon for cheap.  Cisse, who was rumored with Tottenham, Aresenal and Liverpool, cheap for the quality.  Realize we can't compete with Man City, ManU, Chelsea on dollars but we can compete on quality.

Finish Vertongen quickly.  If you can still get Remy do it, if not don't spend your time trying and don't fall into the trap of bidding against the big boys for player like Llorrente, Giraud, Bellhanda, etc. Look to teams like Man City like you did this year...Balloteli, Tevez, Aguero, Dezeko, Ade and whoever they add....someone will want to go play somewhere else and Man City, deep pockets or not will want the large salary off their books, poach that player.  find quality in teams that are dropping like Hoilett and Jarvis, look at player on teams in trouble like Ben Foster or Jordon Mutch. 

Realize player will want to play in England and in top level games look at teams around europe in trouble, Villarreal for example...Nilmar, Rossi,Valero, de Guzman, Zapata all could be poached.

Don't treat yourself as a team that was relagated from the champions league...act like the team that finished 2 spots ahead of the European champion.

Get smart, move quick, don't back down.

true,ctc23,lfc68,,"The summary of the current situation seems good, but I don't agree with the message or conclusions drawn. People may not agree with the decisions FSG have made, but I would ask what owners do they think are currently better? I think every decision FSG have made has been with the intention to make this club successful again. This article says that FSG don't have much time left to impress the fans, but what does that mean? What happens if they don't impress the fans? Who would replace them? How many clubs would you say have ""good"" owners by the standards we are holding FSG to with arguments like this article? Would you prefer to have the club be some business tycoon's plaything?

There were NEVER any promises on the new stadium, in fact FSG were very clear about taking their time with that decision. It is clear we need to move forward with that to become competitive with other top teams in the long term, but it's very important to get the decision right as it will affect the club for decades.

The owners have also worked some very good deals for the club and reinvested a lot into this team. As we've seen this season, the people who invested that money in players did not get what we paid for. FSG have taken a gamble to try a new manager, but I can't say it seems like much more of a gamble than sticking with Kenny. If they stuck with him, gave him another 30m to use and we still ended up outside the CL, what then? Would people support their decision not to make changes, or would they turn on them as they have now? The reality is that these days domestic cups mean very little internationally and if we wish to be drawing and keeping the best players in the world we need to be in the CL and challenging for the League.

Frankly, Kenny doesn't have a great managerial history in recent years and I think it would be a mistake to blindly trust him to take the club forward from here. Not to say that his return has been a failure though, he has had a number of positive contributions since his return. We moved out a lot of surplus players, won a trophy, and perhaps most importantly seen our best players settled during a rough period. Kenny helped settle the ship, now we are looking to a new manager to decide where we are going.",0,1337535554,null,0,false,0,c4q8puy,t3_tvy3d,t1_c4q8puy,t3_tvy3d,null,1428963456,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Because of inequality: poor education, poor prospects, poor roll models, lost communal ties, added to a culture of indulgence, self importance and entitlement that certainly trickles down from the most royal. One of the methods of keeping a 'strong government' is to cultivate low-level violence and thuggery so if need be it can be turned inward against the population. It also divides and conquers the population while the most egregious destructive acts (often of the macro-economic type) are left unnoticed. We are seeing it now against immigrants, benefit claimants, students, greeks, euros, and other scapegoats made by the state.

You just need to look to football culture. Obscene chants and low level violence is perfectly tolerated, whilst pointless hate for other people of similar background just because they have a different coloured shirt is encouraged. While they hate the other team, the executives of both clubs are off sharing champagne, and the players of each club are interchangeable. The communities of the warring fans are being strip-mined of wealth by the same class of people, and profits are leaving the country. Are we to believe that the Balotelli's and the Tevez's aren't going to circulate their wealth locally? Do the Gillet's even pay tax in this country? Unlikely.

**General History**

During the 60s, 70s and 80s, Liverpool FC were far and away the best team in England, and were very often the best in Europe. Winning the League 13 times (and none since) and the European Cup (Champions League) 4 times. And ever since the 90s Liverpool have remained a force to be reckoned with, but never regained their former glory. The odd cup here and there, the most significant being the 2005 Champions League.

**Important People**

*Bill Shankly* - Managed Liverpool from 1959 - 74 and is credited for basically building Liverpool into the team that reigned supreme, and his legacy maintains with a statue outside Anfield and cult status among fans.

*Bob Paisley* Managed Liverpool from 1974 - 83 and is the most successful Liverpool manager of all time, and thus often considered the greatest manager due to his year-to-championship ratio. He is the only manager in history to win 3 European Cups.

*Joe Fagan* 1983-85. An often forgotten name, once won the treble (League, League Cup and European Cup) and was manager during the Heysel Disaster (see below)

*Kenny Dalglish* 1985-91. Continued Liverpool's success and was also manager during the Hillsborough Disaster (see below). Returned in 2011, won the 2012 League Cup but was sacked in May 2012.

*Rafa Benitez* 2004-10. Won the Champions League in 2005 (see below) and brought Liverpool to finish 2nd in 2008-09.

**Important Events**

*Heysel Disaster* European Cup Final 1985 against Juventus, Liverpool fans charged the Juventus fans, whom in their attempts to escape caused a wall to collapse, killing 39 Juventus fans. As a result, all English teams were banned from European football for 5 years, and Liverpool for six. The blame for the incident has often been placed entirely on Liverpool fans.

*Hillsborough Disaster* The worst tragedy in Liverpool history. A human crush caused by overcrowding of confined pens caused the loss of 96 people, all Liverpool fans. There has been much controversy related to the incident, with The Sun newspaper publishing [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Hillsborough_disaster_Sun.jpg/220px-Hillsborough_disaster_Sun.jpg) shortly after, all of the allegations being revealed as lies and resulting in a widespread boycott of the newspaper which remains to this day throughout Merseyside. And there has been much secrecy surrounding whom was responsible for the deaths ""Lack of police control"" has been blamed, but no punishments have been handed out to those responsible, as such 'Justice for the 96' (JFT96) is a common phrase used to try and encourage the release of documents which pertain to this.

*2005 Champions League Final* This is an event which should not be told about, only seen. The best event in Liverpool's recent history and one that will live on in our hearts forever. [Enjoy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9lDB8vSUXc) (If you can, try to full-screen and watch without looking at the related, will be much more enjoyable)

**Managerial Situation**

With the loss of Kenny, there is a hole in the Manager spot, which needs to be filled, and a few names are being exchanged.

*Roberto Martinez* is probably the favourite, and has had talks with the club, he is notably in the running due to his recent incredible achievement of keeping Wigan FC in the Premier League after they were dead last and it seemed certain they would be relegated.

*Rafa Benitez* is currently unemployed, had good success with the club and there are those still loyal to him among the fans.

*Andre Villas Boas* Very experienced manager, however failed to impress with Chelsea whom had a bigger budget but were less willing to give him a chance.

**The owners**

Personally, I feel they didn't give Kenny a chance, he was trying to build a young squad which would've (I believe) performed better next season as they learned to play with one another. However, let's hope they prove me wrong.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In 1892 Liverpool FC was founded to occupy Anfield which Everton FC had previously played at. You heard right, Everton used to play at Anfield before Liverpool. William Barclay became Liverpools first manager fielding a primarily Scottish team. Liverpool won the Lanchashire division in their first season wearing a blue and white strip. Despite winning 5 league titles in the following half century Liverpool floundered to relegation and cup disappointments. In 1959 Liverpool hired Bill Shankly who insisted on revamping the clubs facilities and improving the squad, he incorporated the all red kit. He won 9 honors with us including promotion and 3 league titles. 

Bob Paisley took over from Shankly filling our trophy cabinet over a glorious 9 years winning the league 6 times, the European cup 3 times including 10 (I think) other honors. Fagan took charge after Paisley and led us to our 4th European cup, in 1985 however the Heysel disaster occured in which Liverpool served a 6 year suspension from Europe and 39 Juventus fans were killed. In Dalglishes reign Liverpool would win 3 more league titles, more tragedy occurred though in an FA cup semi final at Hillsborough were 96 Liverpool fans were crushed. 

Reports into the disaster led to stadiums around the country becoming all-seated for safety reasons. The 90's never happened. Gerrard Houllier revived Liverpool success with a treble in 2001 (UEFA, FA, Legue Cup) and Champions league qualification. After another few seasons of mulling about Benitez took charge and led Liverpool to their 5th European cup title in 2005, their 7th FA cup title in 2006 and comfortable league finished up until 2010. FSG took over Liverpool in 2010 appointing Dalglish over Hodgson who had inspired little good form. 

That's Liverpool's history in the briefest possible form, there is so much history to Liverpool that to try and sum it up can hardly do it justice.

FSG started with automatic goodwill for taking care of the club's debt and, simply, not being Hicks &amp; Gillett. The commercial progress of the club, while great, is honestly all just playing catch-up after years of underselling 'the brand'. Don't get me wrong, it's great to see us finally approaching competency in this, especially as FFP kicks in, but I don't see it as overachieving.

Sure FSG have just come into ownership, and don't want to rush anything, but 18 months with no official word of progress on the stadium - which has now been holding the club back for close to a decade - is definitely something to question. I'm glad they didn't make any promises, and I'm not saying we need a decision by now, but some actual news would be good.

Irrespective of whether you or I think Kenny should have stayed or gone, one thing that bothers me is they really should have replaced Comolli by now, especially if they were thinking of sacking Kenny. I get that they're changing the structure, making it two roles instead of one, whatever - but the fact is, we're going into a transfer window with nobody authorized to work on any deals, and any negotiations that had been going on during the season having now stagnated for over a month. And now, they have to bring in 2 new 'director of football' types, and a new manager - when ideally your director of football should be part of the managerial recruitment process. This will take at least 2-3 weeks, and that's more time lost on transfers.

Did we take a serious rethink of our law after people pointed out the hypocrisy of politicians moralizing someone who funded phone tapping whilst they themselves continue to write laws that erode our privacy and freedom on a scale 10,000 times as large? Nope! 

You're never ever going to see politicians stand up to the very same people they are in bed with, to the extent that you will see that, it will be for show, over side issues that distract from the important issues and they'll be treated with a slap on the wrists whilst someone guilty of a much lesser crime in the lower economic ranks will get the full weight of the law thrown at them. 

Perhaps it's just me overdosing on cynicism but I wish people would stop anticipating the day when politicians/government finally ""does the right thing"" and punishes the powerful elites screwing people over, they're one in the same, they're a parasitic entity, it's not going to happen ever and we should instead find different ways to do it ourselves.

Rory chose to wait, and knew that the Doctor was going to show up again eventually to fix things. He was made of plastic, so he didn't have to eat or sleep, and he could go and talk to people if he wanted to. It's heavily implied that he didn't, that he kept himself in exile as a self-punishment for killing Amy in the first place. 

Amy, on the other hand, was stuck in a facility with a bunch of robots that would kill her if they so much as touched her. The Doctor had a track record of abandoning her, and she thought that that's what happened again. Sure, for the first few weeks in there, she probably rationalized that they were in different time streams, and he and Rory were trying to find a way in to save her. But it would be very, very hard to keep believing that as years and years passed by. Amy never asked for this; she accidentally pushed a wrong button. And it's really important to remember that a lot of the end of Series 6 was made up of situations meant to break Amy's faith in the Doctor--look at ""The God Complex."" It's just another facet of that. Amy was stuck alone in a terrible place, with no end in sight. It's a pretty damn human reaction to be angry after that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Good riddance, I say. Let's have only decent companies in the UK.

It's incorrect to consider businesses as moral beings doing you a favor by paying you a wage that you are happy with, that's not how businesses function. It is closer to reality to consider them mindless automatons that will pay you the wage you are happy with only if it is beneficial for them to do so. It is impossible for a business to continue to operate by paying its employees a wage more than or equal to the profit they generate for them, it's a simple math equation, it is not a question of ""good or bad"". (although there are certainly some companies that have better conditions for work than others) the question then becomes how do we best increase the number of companies that can give you favorable conditions. 

I don't have a perfect answer to that question, but the best answer is most certainly not an attitude of ""fuck em"", if they don't want to pay me a wage I like then they can get lost. As I said before, it's a simple costs/profit equation on whether or not a business is capable of hiring people, making it difficult for them to adjust to make use of that equation does not help you in the long run. 

As another commenter explained:
""Increasing the difficulty for an employer to terminate an employee's contract means that employers by and large will not want to take the risk of employing young candidates with little experience. The knock-on effect of this is an increase in youth unemployment.""

It is not the case that if you make it increasingly difficult for companies to fire workers that all the ""bad"" companies that don't want to pay you a wage you are happy with will disappear whilst we are only left with the ""good"". If it's not profitable for them to hire workers they won't do it, it's as simple as that, no amount of regulation will alter that reality.  

I have the same goal as most people, I want people to be paid well in jobs they enjoy, retire young and always have the reassurance that there will be work available to people if they want it. The best way to achieve that (I believe) is with an understanding of economics. http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA4D0A81DC4D9D2E7

In the absence of science and economics, politics is a lot like a shouting match with no standards of evidence or methodology to get to the right conclusion. 

I apologize for the wall of text but this is a topic that deserves it. 

&gt;And we should do more to tax products made abroad and services offered from abroad.

Consider what effect this would have from a business point of view, you're producing things and importing them to the uk, then taxes on imports of whatever product you are producing increases. How do you respond? You respond by either increasing the prices of your products so you can compensate for the losses of the tax or you find another country to sell your products in and you stop selling them in the UK, if you do that the UK government gets less revenue through taxes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve . Now consider the effects that has on consumers in the UK who may be struggling to find a job or finding it hard to keep paying their electricity bills etc, the prices of the product they were previously buying increase, how does that help them? Or even worse, the product they were previously buying ceases to be on sale because the company selling it decided it wasn't profitable to sell here anymore, how would that help people?

and sorry by the way if you think i'm being rude but i hear so much complete nonsense talked about british history it drives me to distraction.  Our economy has been unfairly out of kilter with the rest of the world for a long time, that's what the 'common wealth' is - a desperate attempt to hang onto the tremendous benefit which invading half the world gave us, but that had ended by the end of the last century; our empire is long since gone.  
  
We have to face the reality of a world with india, china, south america and various other places all competing with us for international markets and a share not just of world trade but of global luxury.  All this in a world reaching it's limit, we're out of new places to exploit and out of new new people to enslave.  So we have two options, we can try to return to empire and fight world war three with china OR we can learn to operate in a productive way with maximum efficiency.  
  
The latter requires education, education requires health (because what's the point of educating someone until they're thirty if they're going to die of dysentery at twenty five?) to have health requires sewage and fitness centres - all of which requires a society able to support it.  Personally I've studied the past, i don't want to live in it.  Lets work on systems which improve the quality of the nation, lets move into the future.  
  
do you know why people borrow money to go to university?  because borrowing ten or twenty thousand is better than earning £6 an hour for the rest of your life.  It's understood that it'll get paid back from the increased earnings.  
  
that's why our country has to borrow money to stay afloat, because moving forward and weathering this storm will put us in a much stronger place than many other nations who foolishly cut their education and social budgets - who is paying? we are. who is getting the benefit? we are. 
  
or you can push us into a downward spiral and Chinese historians will marvel that such a powerful and historic nation could crumble into dust and poverty so quickly.  ",0,1337543583,null,0,false,0,c4qa3m7,t3_tvrzq,t1_c4qa3m7,t1_c4q6gyf,null,1428964106,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"ok well forget everything for a while then and let's think about that, employment depends on profitability - who's getting employed and what are they doing? is it as good for our nation to have a million people turning cloth as it is to have half a million rocketsurgeons?  
  
half a million rocketsurgeons would have a piece of platinum the size of texas in orbit by now and your iphone would never run out of battery again!  where as even five million cotton turners would still be sitting in the pre-industrial filth were it not for Fairbairn's modernization and of course the education that let them use it...   
  
so if we could have half a million rocketsurgeons being supported by almost half a million service industry types and a handfull doing nothing at all - isn't that actually better for the nation, and for the companies involved, than having a million people hand beating cotton into rudimentary and rough hewn cloth?  
  
so it's not as simple as whoever has the most poor people and the highest level of destitution can demand the lowest wages and thus profit the most - even if you're in the top 1% life still going to be much nicer in a world with the half million rocketsturgeons then the million cloth spinners.  For a start they might have invented some weaving methods that stop the dreaful itch! 
  
why people in this country seem desperate to drag us back down to the brutal eras of british history i simply can't imagine - maybe they simply never learnt about the highland/lowland clearances, forces exodus to the workhouses of the north, or any of the other barbarities of the past.  Maybe we need a british howard zinn to spread the word.  
  
just to be clear i'll say again; lowering the quality of people will not make england a more attractive place to do business, quiet the opposite it'll throw away the one historic advantage our little island has.

Is it possible that this interview (maybe, just maybe) happened BEFORE the team went out to play and Balague chose to publish it AFTER the match? The only reference to the match itself is the last line:

Because heroin, cigarettes. The serious answer is probably because participants cannot see the full context. For example many don't see the contradiction of hating tabloid journalism whilst paying for a sky sports package. Instead of money being spent on the cultivation of intellect or put to some social good, much time and educational finance goes on school pitches. I probably spent 6 to 8 hours each week of my youth doing football related activities (mostly playing). I should have been doing something that empowers and educates me rather than in a way, being an unpaid child labourer. Most British male children can get to 18 being fairly adept at football but quite lacking in truly useful skills. Meanwhile FIFA has managed to centralise enough wealth they get to impose custom laws on what should be sovereign nations during the world cup. The FA has managed to privatise the national football team. We also see young players bought, sold and traded, and poor countries mined of their best talent.

I blatantly ignored that snide remark and posted: ""Did you hear about Chelsea, you know the Champions of Europe? They're the first London club to win the Champions League (GASP, THAT'S BETTER THAN ARSENAL)

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"i actually agree, somewhat - although the reason for this is very obvious, they implemented a long term plan and promised their citizens social improvements in a way so compelling that the citizens actually believed their government.  It sounds absurd to a western audience but that's actually what happened, Mao wrote a little booklet that explained how the nation could work together to take a giant leap forward and everyone got very excited and little over zealous a few minor dramas later and in an entirely changed world most of the things talked about have actually happened and many ill-educated Chinese peasants are now fully literate, tech savvy rural folk; peasants no more.  and wow, that's before you even look at the major cities!  
  
but of course, along the way there were problems - in china socialist zeal had them killing innocent birds and decimating ecosystems but let's not forget at the same time in america mass bird deaths and destroyed ecosystems because of rampant consumerisms newest fad DDT were just as embarrassing..  in the end all things said and done China has taken a massive leap forwards, and without much of the suffering and hardship which was so obvious in Victorian Britain or her colonies.  heh, china hasn't even had to enslave a third of the world in drastically unfair trade systems either, let's hope she never decides to.  
  
so yes, china has focused on introspective development and hard work while the west has been fighting wars of aggression on every front and wasting every last shred of production potential on opulence and greed.  So yes, as it stands china's plan does seem to have worked out better than ours, i think the drunken football team dude always kinda expected the gravy train to end; it just kinda sucks that we're the ones here holding the reins while it happens.  
  
However there is a solution, it's might not be considered entirely sporting in some circles but i think it's totally fair and the decent thing to do - we change the game, move the goal posts.  Rather that force the world to be this hellish eternal slavery where everyone is forever chasing their tails let's say to china, actually say it to them like they said to their people - her we've realized something, let's work together and go through some hardship together and bond as friends a bit; we want to help create a world where no one has to be at the bottom of the heap scratching the floor to survive, let's help the world develop into self sustaining systems so that we don't need to all fight for every last morsel of resources.  
  
yeah it seams a crazy idea, not trying to take over the world - but let's give it a go, let's admit that we're just a small island with inclement weather that's got a fascinating history and some really worth while old institutions - then let's move forwards, let's try and make things better for the world; let's stop the obsession with owning and controlling everything - let's be another Switzerland but ourown-quintessentially-british-switzerland.  Maybe if we make a good show of it and do it well our last acts as members of the rules of the world can be to teach the world that we don't need to fight and oppress each other to progress as a society, that in fact getting along and sharing with each other is a much better policy for a [proto]advanced species like ours.

I've been walking amongst them under a multitude of guises and I've observed these laws so far:

=====================

**You Cannot Serve Two Masters:**  Conservatives are bad and as the archetypal spring of all evil any positive recognition of them, their actions, or their political allies, is a moral sin. 

=====================

**Free Will is a Lie:** If you don't support AV you read the Daily Mail, even if you're not aware of it, and they've seized control of your mind.

========================

**The Rampant Lion Hears No Dissent:**  Any discussion on Scottish Independence and possible negative outcomes, however limited, must be accompanied with allegations of fear mongering and attempting to intimidate the Scottish vote.

=========================

**The Four Steps to Hate:**  UKIP are against the EU.  So are the BNP. The BNP are racist fascists.  An anti-EU commenter, or anybody that shows even the slightest UKIPian sympathy, should therefore be asked if they're xenophobic as a matter of course, just to be safe.

true,ctc23,lfc68,,"&gt;I think its saying that FSG's 'bedding in' period is over, and while they've made some progress so far, now marks a very crucial point in their ownership. 

I can agree with this, for sure. While I try to stay away from the doom &amp; gloom, i think what [Didi said](http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1071449/dietmar-hamann-fears-for-liverpool-future?cc=5901) about this being a crucial year is very pertinent, and each successive year away from the CL makes it harder to return. 

You've also nicely laid out some of the issues we face in a more neutral manner than the article. I found the sentiment of ""these are things that need to be fixed 'or else'"" off-putting, but like I said the article did do a good job of pointing out the challenges we face.

As for the DoF, it would be nice to have a replacement already, but I'm not too worried about that as I would prefer to take a little extra time to get the right person and make sure that they can work with whoever the new manager will be.

Buuut one that you should definitely bookmark for next season is [First Row Sports](http://www.firstrowsports.eu/sport/football.html) They stream all matches free online, as I know it's hard for you guys to see them sometimes. In terms of fan stuff, there's [The Redmen](http://www.youtube.com/user/WeAreTheRedmen?feature=watch) Couple of experienced Liverpool lads who give excellent previews, match reactions and instant reaction to recent news. They'll be covering this summer's transfer period in-depth which is good to keep up with so it doesn't seem like a team of new players next season :P.

Yes, football fans enjoy football. Just because you think what they take enjoyment from is ""remote and vicarious"" doesn't devalue it at all. Also, if you look a bit closer at the stands you'll probably see a lot of fans doing things like cheering and smiling, all classic signs of enjoyment.

I find your attitude that you know what's best for the working class while they can't figure it out for themselves patronising and downright offensive.

&gt;I probably spent 6 to 8 hours each week of my youth doing football related activities (mostly playing). I should have been doing something that empowers and educates me rather than in a way, being an unpaid child labourer. Most British male children can get to 18 being fairly adept at football but quite lacking in truly useful skills.

Well first of all, the exercise undoubtedly did you good, as it does for a lot of kids. Did you enjoy playing football? Well, again, a lot of kids do. ""Kids spend time doing a physical activity they enjoy"" is not an argument against football. It is not the fault of football that kids aren't learning useful skills, it's the fault of the education system. Kids having a kickabout at lunchtime doesn't stop them from paying attention in physics lessons.

&gt;Meanwhile FIFA has managed to centralise enough wealth they get to impose custom laws on what should be sovereign nations during the world cup. The FA has managed to privatise the national football team. 

Yes fifa is corrupt and in need of reform, but this isn't an argument against football's existence any more than the Leveson enquiry is an argument against newspapers' existence. As to the national team, of course it's privatised, why exactly should the public sector be paying?

&gt;We also see young players bought, sold and traded, and poor countries mined of their best talent.

and if football wasn't so lucrative, this talent that is being mined wouldn't be worth anything anyway.

&gt;Most importantly football as it is today, an economic behemoth, is a source of inequality and has little utility beyond distracting the working class from their lives which would be otherwise void of meaning, success, and social ties.

Again, a patronising and extraordinarily insulting caricature of the working class. Even if what you say is true, it's not like there aren't other things out there that can distract people from their lives. Alcohol, for one.

Do you realise how close that is to blaming social pathologies on 'the Devil'? Inequality is a separate issue from poverty. There is strong evidence that inequality is almost the [root of all social pathologies](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html).

&gt; Being poor isn't an excuse.

But it is a cause. These people might have no want for the necessities (a claim I'd argue is an over simplification †), but the communities that they come from are impoverished in so many ways. They have almost no say in politics, no access to land, no internal constructs that bind people together, poor education, and so one. What they do have access to is endless amounts of garbage television, pressures of consumerism, debt, superficial definitions of beauty, MTV culture, and bus shelters. And of course football supporting. People lacking meaningful lives will find it anywhere: sports (which should come under nationalism), drug abuse (inclusive of alcohol), religion, promiscuity, teenage pregnancies, and so on. I'm not surprised that those lacking in self-worth are willing to fight you over the most innocuous of glances.

&gt; Vandalising stuff.

Have you ever wondered why this type of violence that occurs on a weekly basis is tolerated, but 'illegal' behaviour like protesting that may have elements of less widespread violence receives overwhelming and special police attention? I'd argue that the former is completely tolerated as long as it happens within the confines of poorer neighbourhoods, because it poses no economic threat to the rich. Compare how the police dragged their feet when it was parentless scum from Rochdale getting abused, with the reaction to rich white girls that go missing on the continent.

but china isn't the only formerly exploited mega nation to compete with us - it's not even the only one in that corner of asia, or the only one in that corner of asia with a proficient space program....  India is now hugely rich, resource wise and mining wise they're one of the richest places on the planet - they also have living conditions thousands of times better than when we left, education systems fast become superior to our own - they're even starting to make invent tech products we simply can't compete with.  oh, and they already have solar collection arrays (closed system steam, sterling) providing them electrical power at a fraction of the price even the markets we've been fighting for in the middle east for decades can provide.  
  
then there's all the other little places, the countries that have writing which looks a bit like Chinese who are already more high tech than us, have faster internet and cooler gadgets.  the nations with more space, more resources and more free energy from the sun...

Also, as a side note, every day people from the US post things that are very common in the UK, such as Jammie Dodgers, Jelly Babies and things with the St Johns Ambulance logo on.

Now I'm not trying to start an argument, I wish the quality of /r/doctorwho was higher and we tried to improve things with a community content vote, however, most people wanted everything and anything to stay in /r/doctorwho.

Do tons of drugs, drink every night etc. Doesn't matter because you don't have any responsibilities. No need to save money because you get a pension anyway. No need to worry about the health risks - NHS takes care of it.

Of course there is a devaluation, just like how people 'befriending' soap characters is anti-social, or like how the buck ruts the ornamental deer. Artificial stimulants hollow people out from the inside.

&gt; I find your attitude that you know what's best for the working class while they can't figure it out for themselves patronising and downright offensive.

A vacuous ad hominem attack.

&gt; Well first of all, the exercise undoubtedly did you good.

No, I am left with arthritis of the hip and knee and I haven't yet hit a third decade. There are far less damaging forms of exercise than football, and they don't have to be with in a social construct that leads to inequality and tribalism.

&gt; Kids having a kickabout at lunchtime doesn't stop them from paying attention in physics lessons.

No, put it helps a country not to notice unethical and destructive policy by the government. In a desperate attempt to gain favour for doing nothing Cameron has succeeded.

&gt; but this isn't an argument against football's existence 

I'm not arguing over football's existence, but of current organisation. Why does the news present football results as key items when the majority of those interested would have been live spectators? I'll give you my answer: because of an affirmation bias. The state wants you to be convinced that the endeavour you witness was of importance, and of course that is five or ten minutes the news gets to talk about something of manufactured importance. It doesn't affect your pension, access to food, employment, education, or general well-being besides a short-lived sense of victory perhaps.

&gt; As to the national team, of course it's privatised, why exactly should the public sector be paying?

Privatised means in this context that some small group of people get to own 'the rights' to what is supposed to be a national endeavour. And I suspect that the public sector pays greatly: lost taxes, security costs, it encourages sedentary spectatorship, etc.

&gt; Alcohol, for one. If you think English football collapsing would result in some kind of working class political revolution, you're just dreaming I'm afraid.

Why do you think ancient Rome liked its bread and circuses? The latent resentment that builds up in the lower classes needs a release. An artificial sense of personal satisfaction often revolves around feeling superior to others. Previously they threw men to lions, had public hangings, burned witches, committed genocide, that sort of thing, and now we have football where enjoyment comes as much from the failure and putting down of others as the 'victory' itself.",0,1337549277,null,0,false,0,c4qb3i0,t3_tvvt1,t1_c4qb3i0,t1_c4qap24,null,1428964575,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; We all get free education to 16 or 18.

We get taught the national curriculum, which doesn't really empower people and probably does the opposite. It doesn't really build inquisitive minds but indoctrinates, whilst readying the population for authority and subservient 9-5 employment. The other plus is that a family unit has no excuse when it comes for both parents being employed. I see these children almost like orphans of the state, and perhaps the adults too. Do you really think it a choice? I suspect these areas also suffer a culture lacking in rational discourse. (Question time doesn't quite cut it.) There are whole industries engineered to distract and promote superficial desires, and how is the impressionable teenager supposed to cope?

In a way most people don't have a chance of agency or real independence until there are post graduate or of that age, and even then most or hoping that the large corporation doesn't outsource facilities. 'We' certainly don't have much influence in politics, motivation of interest, nor a national culture of participation (~30% makes not for a democracy). Do you find it strange that we have Britishness defined as 'sense of humour', waving flags at sporting events, and the like, yet it isn't important enough to be taught in schools apart from how we beat the Germans those two times and are the noble champions of history? Nothing is said of parliament, the bank of england, the Privy List, Duchy of Cornwall's tax exemption, types of electoral systems, Knights of the Garter, or any other of the key institutions.

&gt; As for violence, it seems to be tolerated to an extent because it's almost what we expect.

It also makes the government plenty of money along with (inter)national brewers and pub chains. Protests get shut down when police preempt violence, but we know what is going to happen outside these night clubs but they only ever mop up some of the mess afterwards. We either say that places like Sweden or Japan have genetics or some other internal mechanism that makes them 'more civilised' compared to the 'demons' of the Brits, or we blame the corrupting environment that people grow up in.

So, what about football makes it an ""artificial stimulant"" in a way that say, art, isn't? The emotions instilled by art are no more corporeal than those instilled by football.

&gt;A vacuous ad hominem attack.

Uh, no. It was an expression of my opinion. Had I said ""your views are patronising and offensive and **that's why they're wrong**"", it would have been an ad hominem.

&gt;it helps a country not to notice unethical and destructive policy by the government. In a desperate attempt to gain favour for doing nothing Cameron has succeeded.

I don't think people don't notice the unethical and destructive policies of this government. Many of these policies are directly influencing the lives of working class people. You think someone's not going to notice that their train fare is rising day on day? Someone who is unemployed isn't going to notice their local jobcentre has closed down? Because of football?



There are many, many reasons for the political disenfranchisement of large swathes of our population, and I'd argue football ""distracting"" them is an extremely minor one, if at all. It's absolutely dwarfed, I believe, by a sense that politicians don't actually represent ordinary people and that the system is rigged against them.

Where I do agree with you is that football may act as an outlet for the latent resentment you mention at the end of your post. However, the existence of this resentment in the first place shows that sports don't stop people noticing they're being fucked over. We've had massive protests recently about austerity, and big public sector strikes.

I contest that the removal of an ""unproductive"" outlet, like football, would result in greater effectiveness of attempts to challenge the status quo, because there will *always* be a myriad of such outlets for people to turn to. Some of these, such as alcoholism, can be far far more damaging than football.",0,1337551357,null,0,false,0,c4qbgni,t3_tvvt1,t1_c4qbgni,t1_c4qb3i0,null,1428964748,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Here, *in theory* we have access to NHS dentists. They don't care as much about the cosmetics of our dentures (beyond a point), but they will make sure they are functional and fairly nice. Therefore, most of us have functional, fairly nice, teeth - just not up to the US ideal of pearly white, uniform nashers. In the US, they have more on each extreme than us.

true,antastic,flair5,,"That's some straight up FIFA 12 Manager Mode transfer window aggression you're suggesting.

Levy is never going to be that aggressive - he'll spend his time picking his man, making sure to pinch every penny he can from every deal.  Right up there with our transfer priorities should be a star keeper (Lloris, Krul, Akinfeev maybe) because Big Bad Brad is getting on, may not have another whole season left in him.  

I'm not agreeing with all of whom you've declared ""dead weight"".  Defoe netted 17 times for us this season and, personally, I think it'd be heartbreaking to lose him.  We should keep Corluka around in case Walker gets himself hurt.  For transfers in, Holt's transfer request was denied I believe...  Hoilett would be a good move.  Dembele too.  We also need a more consistent/defensive left back - Benny would leave in a heartbeat for more money.  We should move for Leighton Baines or Santon.  I'd also love to see Huddlestone play a larger role next season.  Apparently he's not cutting his hair until he scores a goal.

Really don't expect Bale to go.  He can't ignore all the media surrounding him, advising him not to.  He's a young lad and his place is still at the lane.

Realistically, let's say five in, five out.  Who will it be?  For me,

Out: Modric, Gomes, Bentley, Bassong, Jenas

In: Lloris, Vertonghen, Adebayor, Remy, Hazard, (Hoilett)

Why Hazard?  Because fuck you I can still dream!

Balague put up a [link](http://bit.ly/L9lovg) to the whole interview and it reads drastically differently from the soccernet version. 

The Balague interview describes the perspective of a striker who went through one of the worst rough patches of his life, was unsure of what the club wanted for him, was unsure of what his role was at the club IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ENTIRE SEASON. 

Soccernet has cherry-picked his quotes to revolve around ONE quote: ""I wanted to take the penalty but they said no.""

The request and response is quite comments during PK shootouts (see Robben and Heynckes during the same match which led to Neuer being nominated) and could have been just an off-hand comment by a striker who wanted to make a bigger mark on the biggest stage in club football. Those who wished to read into could read whatever they chose. We see what soccernet chose. 

For the record, Balague hasn't tweeted/mentioned anywhere that Torres wants to leave. The interview does state that Torres was, during a period, contemplating his position at the club but I'd probably attribute it to being a standard human reaction - just as any other striker with a bad patch would. (see Sturridge and Arsenal/Man City rumors) 

All in all, while Torres would have loved to take a pen at Munich, he was NOT being a diva and he doesn't look like he wants to leave the club as the Soccernet article would have us believe.

I am British, and I am a conspiracy theorists, activist, post modern thinking researcher. I'm a professional software developer and actively concern myself with awareness spreading of substances such as corruption, lies, injustice, privacy breachers and other cruelties.  

I too, try to inspire enlightenment, self informing and every chance I get to tackle ignorance. 

My experience has been that Americans are more passionate about their freedom and the information I have to share. But it's not just USA, likewise in Africa we're seeing revolutions take place, in europe we're seeing mass protesting. 

I proclaim that the UK society is under a glamour - a veil of which induces ignorance. **keep calm and carry on**. 

This view is biased - yes - as I am a researcher, truth-er and conspiracy theorists. Of course I'm not the only one, we have our occupy movement, hacktivists, protesters like everyone else. But our docile culture of just dealing with what the government put us through is a **joke**. Outright, I'd say USA have more ignorance issues, but they aren't afraid to get behind their sword when they recognise injustice. Here in the UK it's like trying to spur on sheep to defend an attack of wolves.

Allow me to inject a truth to lubricate the point. ***our privacy is being taken out-right***. The government see's to extend an already unjust level of surveillance. Online tracking, logging, reading texts, emails and phone calls - these are just a few of things the govenrment are pushing for.. AND they're right now in the news for exploiting that information. While it's not *in your face* taking of your rights. It's an extremely import thing we're quietly giving away. 

I don't ask you stand up to a cause for my sake. I don't ask that you wade away from a happy life to help me. But I do ask, not as a Brit, a son, brother or employee. I ask a Human, to you humans to not sit by and allow this atrocity. If you recognise injustice, if you see the train steering off the tracks then contend yourself with finding out more. All I ask is you ask more, and look more. I don't need to ask your to stand beside me, because once you're informed, you'll be standing beside me on your own accord. 

So, next time you have an opportunity to make a tea reference or some other tiddly-squid British reference. Do so to your hearts content - but also see that your country is not bent over for a insidious cause. 

**TL:DR** Instead of showing the Reddit community we're the people on Britains got talent, xfactor, big brother or jeremy kyle. Show them we're fucking british, we're small and calm, but we're educated, and we can control corruption and we're unwavering in the defiance of governmental and corporate injustice. We are the student riots, the inventors of thousands of global successes, the occupy movement. Let there be no better mascot for us than **Robing Hood** as we too take from the unjust and give to the just. Let us be known not for out foreign policy or how many nukes we have. But let us be known as the nation who wasn't ruled by the 1%. And for heavens sake, do NOT trust the mainstream media - thank you for reading.

true,rand_althor,silence,Silence,"I'm disappointed with how Moffat is handling the show.  (For this I'm inevitably commenting on series 5 and 6 both)

Back in the Davies era, Moffat would write one episode per series (sometimes a two-parter).  His stories then (Empty Child/Doctor Dances, Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead) were excellent, and sometimes the highlight of that series. So when news broke that Moffat would be the next showrunner, I was excited.

Eleventh Hour was a fantastic episode, one that I never tire of watching.  I rewatched it the other day when it was on iPlayer, and still enjoyed it.  

Series five went on.  River returned.  At first, I was intrigued by her story.  Who was she to the Doctor?  

I'll just abridge the rest of this.  Amy didn't prove to be an interesting companion.  Not sure if that's because of Gillan (most likely) or how Moffat was writing her (also likely).  River Song became a disappointment.  Didn't like the kind of character she was becoming.  

The style Moffat is going with the show feels so different from what he was doing in the Davies era.  At this point, I don't like what he's doing with the show.  Sure, the ""Doctor Who as a fairy tale"" argument is there, but I don't like just how fairy tale the show has become.  River Song is just...a character I've grown to hate.  She's overpowered, she's too unrealistic (yes this is DW, but still).  Amy and Rory...guh, no.  I was already tired of Davies' shtick of the companion being the Most Important Woman in the Universe, now Moffat has the couple with the Magic Time Lady.

Guh.  Then there's this whole thing of the Question, and the Silence.  The question being Doctor Who is just unforgivable.  Way back in the '60s, when the show began, Verity Lambert, original producer for the show, said several times that Doctor Who, as a question, should never be a part of the show.  It's the gimmick, yes, but the story is about the adventures.  Now Moffat's playing with that question as very central to his overall story arc.  If Moffat actually tries to give the Doctor a name as a resolution to the story, I'm done.  

There have been some good episodes.  Eleventh Hour was a high point, fantastic episode.  Gaiman's episode, The Doctor's Wife, was wonderful.  Vincent and the Doctor was beautiful.  God Complex was great (and, as far as I'm concerned, was the end of Amy and Rory's story.  Bringing them back after that ruins their story the way Rose's return in series four ruined Army of Ghosts/Doomsday).

TL;DR: Moffat has proven to be a disappointment, to me.  ",0,1337553070,null,0,1337610422,0,c4qbrp3,t3_twits,t1_c4qbrp3,t3_twits,null,1428964892,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

1) No way Rory could have spent those 2,000 years alone.

This is evidenced by his appearance as a museum guard later - he has got a job working in the same building, rather than holed up in an apartment across the street.

2) He deliberately kept himself in as much solitary confinement as possible as self-punishment/redemption for killing Amy.

Now, while I believe (2) is what started his protection of the Pandorica, it didn't carry on that way for that length of time.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; River Song became a disappointment. Didn't like the kind of character she

The issue is that Moffat (like all of the female characters on Doctor Who now) devolved River into an image of sex. 

The character who once was this wise, independent, and savvy character was reduced to high-heels, dresses, winking all the time, and tossing out flirtations like they're going out of style.

Amy's a short-skirted kissogram and even *the goddamn TARDIS* is now ""sexy"" under Moffat's design. Which is an enormous shame because all of his previous works contained such strong and independent female roles (Nancy, Madame de Pompadour, Sally Sparrow, River).

Unlike Rose's relationship with the Doctor, which was based on ""so much more"" than the physical boyfriend/girlfriend dynamic, aevery major female character now thinks the Doctor is ""hot"" (which, if you're going with Matt Smith, is a bit of a stretch. He's not bad but it's not like people would stop him on the street before he was the Doctor and say ""Hello good-lookin'!"")

It's just annoying when Doctor Who should be (and has been) so much better than that. I thought we moved past the sexism that once mired Doctor Who, but it's almost like we're walking into a revival of the misogynist concept what with Amy nagging and abusing Rory and Moffat giving the Doctor lines like ""of course she's difficult, she's *a woman.*""

They are extracting social status from the colour of a shirt. I don't think *it controversial to call that artificial**.

&gt; **No, that's why you are wrong**

The ad hominem attack doesn't require the orator to weave the diversion into the argument, it just needs to undermine the credibility of the other person. Offensive operates completely rhetorically. As for patronising 'the working class' haven't collectively worked out that binge drinking, teen pregnancies or smoking are socially destructive pastimes.

&gt; I'd argue football ""distracting"" them is an extremely minor one

It was minor why are we discussing this in the context of Cameron's magnificent PR exercise? The largest corrupting factor in politics is inequality, and football certainly contributes.

&gt;  Where I do agree with you is that football may act as an outlet for the latent resentment you mention at the end of your post. However, the existence of this resentment in the first place shows that sports don't stop people noticing they're being fucked over. We've had massive protests recently about austerity, and big public sector strikes.

I'm speculating now, but riots in Britain occur in the Summer (that is actually agreed). I wonder weather there is any research correlating those with the lack of an outlet during the off-season. It does stop people from feeling bad about being fucked over, but football is wonderful in making people feel part of something they are utterly disconnected from. The lack of meaning in their life would have to be found elsewhere. I'm not surprised that the most ardent supports come from the most deprived areas of Britain.

true,skoberlink,null,null,"&gt;I know exactly why you posted your comment, however, I would ask why in particular this post? On any given day you can scroll through /r/doctorwho and see multiple posts just like this one.

Well to be honest this one had the bad luck to be the one that seemed to cross a line for me.  I generally just ignore posts like this but I feel like I've been seeing more and more lately.  I have no evidence for that, maybe I'm just noticing it more now.  I know there have been others and I would like to see fewer of them in general.  This just happened to be the place that I decided to do something about it. Possibly because it has more of a relation to my own home country than things like Jammie Dodgers.

&gt;For example, as I browse /r/doctorwho/new/ I see a comic which seems to have nothing to do with Doctor Who except maybe a vague connection to the teselecta, a gif of a mime pretending to be a statue (not a weeping angel) and a demotivational poster showing a guy who is fairly well known for standing in the background of BBC news reports claiming to be the 12th doctor.

As for this, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I generally stick to front page material.  I appreciate what the Knights of New do but I don't enjoy slogging through stuff like that.  When I posted the comment this was in my aggregated front page, not just the subreddit.  That is partially due to the fact that I hide upvoted as well as downvoted links to keep my front page fresh and to encourage myself to at least contribute that small amount.  I never see a large part of the /new stuff.  It's distinctly possible that a lot of it gets caught before I would see it and this one happened to make it through (good for OP!).

&gt;Also, as a side note, every day people from the US post things that are very common in the UK, such as Jammie Dodgers, Jelly Babies and things with the St Johns Ambulance logo on.

As a non-UK Whovian, I feel less qualified to point things like this out.  I am generally aware of things like Jammie Dodgers and Jelly Babies because I really enjoy British comedy (Eddie Izzard, IT Crowd, Monty Python) but I have no idea on their context.  I assume they're common and I generally ignore such posts but I don't feel like I can comment in judgement when I lack so much context. I would prefer to see less of this as well although I understand the novelty of it more.  

I guess the difference I see is this post is something common that has zero relation to the show other than that it sort of looks like a character. At least things like Jelly Babies have a connection to the show and are rare outside the UK.  I probably only recognize this distinction because I'm from the US though.  In fact, as I write this, it doesn't seem like much of a distinction at all but I've decided to leave it in for discussion.

&gt;Now I'm not trying to start an argument, I wish the quality of /r/doctorwho was higher and we tried to improve things with a community content vote, however, most people wanted everything and anything to stay in /r/doctorwho.
Just my two pennies worth...

Not at all, you've brought up some excellent points.  If we can't have a reasonable discussion, how would things like this get figured out? (HAHA but this is the Internet!)  I wasn't aware that a content discussion had taken place before.  I've been in this subreddit less than a year and I imagine it's been around quite a bit longer than that.

But I think Mancini can use him as such..

And, you can't forget, that the reason Rory was plastic to begin with is because he followed Amy along on this insane set of trips with a man in a blue box and got sucked into nothingness when trying to help/save her in a prior episode.  Rory had not much faith to begin with in the Doctor, but somehow his faith in Amy was always there.  As far as the comparison, yes they are different, and Amy had every right to be mad (it's only human).  But if you look at it as a whole, Rory is much more than a decent human being, he's unbelievable.  All because of his love for Amy.

When I look back on the Moffat episodes like ""Blink,"" ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead,"" and ""Empty Child/Doctor Dances,"" they were utterly fantastic in the plot development, character development, and overall effect. Those episodes made me think ""This is the best episode of Doctor Who I've ever seen!"" Now it just seems like everything was thrown together, like a ten year old trying to write a screenplay for an original major motion picture.
As jimmysilverrims pointed out, Moffat's starting to ad the sexism back into the series, which entirely contradicts the earlier seasons with Cristopher Eccleston and David Tennat, in which the female companion was a MAJOR contribution to the show and not just a ""sexy"" girl that follows The Doctor around.
I will admit, the introduction of The Silence was amazing and kept me interested, giving me the old Whovian feel again. Other than that, however, I started actually losing interest in the show because the stories were so sloppy.

This improved slightly throughout RTD's run, with S3 introducing the Doctor's watch, and S4 foreshadowing Rose's return.  Some of the finales were tremendous fun, but they never really surpassed the procedural-type format of the show.

She's unruly, but she certainly drags on the Doctor's coattails. And she doesn't act lost in an unfamiliar world, if anything she acts unrelateably  overconfident in her appraisal of the foriegn and bizarre. 

Seriously, she yells to a Silurian scientist that she is ""Amy Pond! Do you hear me, *Amy Pond!*"" with the arrogance of someone who was much more entitled and spoiled than a parentless kissogram would. She consistently judges and applies her morality to other species as if she was correct at all times (a phase Rose and other companions quickly grew out of).

But the real issue is that Amy not only acts arrogantly, but does so in an unfunny way.

A lot of what she says could be written as clever banter, but it oftentimes is delivered with decidedly unraised brows. Rarely is there genuine snark behind her remarks. There's just no punch there.

And worst of all is that she's not given the chance to appear like an actual human being. Her snogging the Doctor and effectively cheating on her fiancee was a big (and immaturely rash) decision she made. The fact that she *never* sees the consequence of these actions is a huge mistake. 

We never really get to see a turning point for Amy where she becomes responsible. She just gets soundbites of dialogue and magnanimous but empty titles like ""The Girl Who Waited"".

Martinez? Really?

Liverpool is such a big club. Has more than 10 European cups, 18 titles which is still the highest despite a dry spell of over 2 decades and countless domestic cups. And the top candidate for the manager position of this club is someone whose achievement was to keep Wigan in the league?

Sorry to say this but Liverpool has to change this mentality, before anything. Those good old days will never come back with managers like Hodgson or Martinez. Or with players like Carroll or Downing or Jose Enrique.

These people are not of the same calibre as FC Liverpool actually is. And for some reason that I cannot understand, people who make the decisions at Anfield always underestimate the power and the stature of the club, which only makes things worse.

Liverpool deserves a manager who tries to play positive football and not weird long-ball tactics. Liverpool should have a young, ambitious tactician who is aware of the dynamics of modern football. Someone not scared to put attacking full backs, creative midfielders on the pitch. Someone who is or has the potential to be among the class of Guardiola, Mourinho, Low, Klopp, Wenger, or similar.

If you can play it with a group of people who are quick on their feet, know how to weave a good story with actions, and have a good sense of humor, it's one of the funnest RPGs around.

I think he has shown some playmaking ability at Chelsea that he didn't really display while he was here (it was part of his profile at Athletico) but even now it is just a secondary skill.  That means he would be a very good fit as the CENTER of a 4-3-3 with Suarez to one side.  It would probably work best with Suarez on the left because then you can put a right footed attacking player who plays wider than Suarez as the RWF usually does to allow Gerrard to fill in from the right of midfield.  You then need a left-footed midfielder to bracket Lucas, unless you believe in Charlie Adam.

While I don't think there is any chance that Torres returns, I still think that this is the formation that gets the best out of Suarez and Gerrard as well as opening up the natural, long-term spot for either Sterling or Suso.  This is why I don't think Carroll is a good fit for our team, regardless of his positive last month.  A mobile, predatory forward would be a huge signing for us.

He was at times found wanting in the premier league, where sometimes a different approach is needed. To win the league, you need to win ugly.. Grind results. His possession based tactical approach with careful build up is great against teams that come to play.. However i remember playing games against teams like Stoke, where they literally come and park the bus and we would end up settling for a point.

If we had Champions League football next season id probably be for Benitez getting another shot, but as it stands we need a coach that can focus on getting our league form back to the standard it should be. I think a manager that understand the English game will be better for us.

Also FSG have said from day one they want a young ambitious manager to be with them in the long term, much like when they took control of the Boston Red Socks. Martinez and AVB seem to fit that bill.

Besides, there'll be more options next year, although I might be convinced to change my mind given Foster's situation (you're mad if you think we can compete if Lloris or Akinfeev become available now).

As I said in my post, Levy is going to be the problem with getting this much business done (as is usual, and usually forgotten by most fans who just like to criticise Redknapp). If we're to recover from this setback quickly and well, he needs to recognise that his standard operating procedure isn't going to cut it. Believe me, I don't hold much hope that he will.

Defoe is on the deadweight list because this season he has proven conclusively that he isn't capable of being a starter for this team, and he doesn't want to stay if he's not a starter. As I said, I'd keep him and save on having to do the extra business if we could.

As noted elsewhere, we have the excellent and young Naughton to cover for Walker, so Corluka is no longer required and happens to be one of our more valuable saleable assets. Naughton's been very effective at LB too this season which is bonus.

Holt - don't let the fact that his transfer request was denied make you think he won't be moving - once a request is officially made like that a player rarely stays put. He would be a decent option for us, but there are more preferable ones for me.

It had SO much potential --unfortunately whoever was supposed to be keeping an eye on the script must have nodded off during the entire second half of it --lots of lovely fleeting McGann (and Ashbrook, and McCoy, and yes, even Roberts) moments, but they're all buried beneath a storyline that's damn near incomprehensible.  It's almost as if they tried TOO hard.  

I don't question Philip David Segal's love for Doctor Who or his desire to restart the franchise, I question the manner in which this film was assembled --and more disappointingly, how it was MARKETED.  It wasn't the first time Fox had totally botched a brilliant sci-fi premise --and it sure wouldn't be the last.

McGann was/is a brilliant Doctor.  Treat yourself to some of the audio adventures --he is positively firing on all cylinders, particularly in the manner in which he develops a touching and frankly beautiful relationship with India Fisher as the Doctor's companion Charley Pollard.  THAT'S the eighth Doctor we should have gotten.  Passionate, thoroughly in love with life and adventuring, even a bit of a romantic --and ultimately a compellingly tragic figure in the making since we know the Time War is looming on his horizon.  

If any Doctor deserves a return to the current series for some more screen time, it is McGann.

* **Re: Cameron/Chealsea submission**

The only word which makes the title of #2 (The PM) editorialised is 'properly.' If 'properly' was meant to convey 'as he should' then perhaps it's editorialised, but if 'properly' was used to instead to convey 'as opposed to casually, or muted support' then it's less of an editorialisation and more of an observation of the way in which Cameron showed his support.

* **Re: HA! Queen...**

The 'HA! Queen...' one: I think it's quite an extravagant assertion that the moderation of the submission was based exclusively on a moderator's desire to 'protect the honour' of the Queen. It's not as if there have been previous instances of anti-monarchic discussion being stifled - though correct me if I'm wrong. 

I think the simple truth is: it was a turd of a submission. 

Ignoring the fact that the submission fits the dictionary-definition of 'image macro,' the submission was not in the style prescribed in the side bar (see: 'as if they are being reported by proper news organisations'). The subject-matter isn't something that is unwelcome on /r/unitedkingdom, it's just that the message was presented terribly.
Let's re-frame the submission - in text only (and I'm being generous here); 
&gt;'There's a certain ironic juxtaposition in our grandly adorned monarch giving a speech which deals for the most part in matters of austerity measures. [Is it not time to reconsider the viability of the monarchy?]'

Same subject matter, more in keeping with both the moderator's side-bar submission-directions and the general tone of the subreddit as determined by the denizens of thereof.

He plays fast attacking football, and even SAF admired what he had done with the club and he maintained that Wigan were much better than their league position. The man is a different kettle of fish than Hodgson who will take his 4-4-2 target man orientated style to the grave. 

SAF came from Aberdeen to manage Man UTD as a relative nobody, winning the SPL is admirable, but i fear the celtic of today would be a mid to top table club at best.. He didnt have early success but he built his team and now look at him, probally the greatest manager of our era or any era for that matter. 

Im not a fan of people who say you NEED a manager with a record of success, because its not always going to happen. Put an average manager in charge of Real or Barca with their spending power and they would get results, the real thing to look for is a man with a good footballing brain, plays attractive positive football and is a good man manager. I think Martinez ticks those boxes. And if you had ever watched Wigan play you would think so too.

He hasn't had the chance to flex his muscles in the transfer window with the buttons Wigan has to play with, but he has gotten some real gems with what little he has. A few of his players could easily be playing high end Premier football. It would be interesting to see what he could do 30m + to play with. But i think he would do a decent job with us.

VdV's hardly gonna have a lot of extra space to drop into just because it's Huddlestone operating behind him rather than Modric. VdV already spends a lot of time coming deep for the ball as it is, something he's allowed to do by Modric's tendency to overlap him to move forward. Huddlestone won't do this as much, if at all, so if anything I think his introduction will see VdV staying further forward not further back.

Redefining it as a 433 makes more sense of what you're describing to me, with the wide players pushed higher and tighter, playing a closer supporting role to the striker, and allowing the central midfield space to spread out a little more and take the extra deeper player. I like the idea, but I'm not convinced we can play both Sandro and Hudlestone in such a system - do either have the qualities to play the more advanced role alongside VdV? This is one of the reasons I'd like to see Dembele come in, as I feel he'd be a fantastic fit for this system. He's shown so much quality when I've seen him for Fulham.

I'd also be a little worried about Huddlestone sitting at the base of that central three. While, as you say, that role in front of the back line would be the perfect place from which to quickly pick up the ball from defence and exercise his amazing passing range, I'd have to see the way he comes back from this injury before I decided he was mobile enough to really be effective enough there - mobility is an aspect of his game that he has improved hugely in recent years, but I'm pretty worried such a longterm injury might have set him back significantly.",0,1337571101,null,0,false,0,c4qf1pn,t3_tvtpj,t1_c4qf1pn,t1_c4q7l3p,null,1428966543,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The best they could do is try to send it out wide to the fullbacks or to Modric if he dropped back to pick up the ball in that instance, but then that left us short at the front and he wouldn't have many options going forward and our attack stagnated. See: away at Anfield. I feel like in cases where we're getting pressed early and often and relatively deep in our own half, Huddlestone is our best guy for that, but even though his mobility's improved from what I've seen, I'm not entirely convinced he should be shielding the back 4, but he's still 25 or 26, if he developed the defensive part of his game a bit, I could see him performing a Xabi Alonso-type role for us.",0,1337573541,null,0,false,0,c4qfi2x,t3_tvtpj,t1_c4qfi2x,t1_c4qf1pn,null,1428966758,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Uh, I thought that was the absolute definition of an image macro.

Personally, I hold the view that it should be ok to laugh at the Queen, and that doing so is, socially speaking, a very British thing to do. Politically I think the comment about her wealth vs. the nation's austerity is not only appropriate but good satire. I feel the tone of ""woman in £1M hat"" is similar to that of a Punch cartoon or frontpage headline.

I downvoted the photo of Cameron cheering ~~the troops~~ Chelsea because that does feel like propaganda - as someone pointed out in that thread, he is *not* our mate. He is a multimillionaire representative of the generational rich who rule us.

However, slapping text on an image would seem to make it an image macro, and it does lower the tone of the submission a bit. I think it the same image was submitted without superimposed text, but the same words (""woman in £1M hat makes speech about austerity"") as submission title then I think (I hope) it would have gone through.

Image macros conventionally refer to consistent iconic images with people riffing on the textual content. Crude text on images also 'democratises' graphics because what used to be an esoteric medium requiring art skills and publishing system can now be done by anyone that wields a mouse. That is why I believe rage comics exploded, barriers to entry were lowered and you were judged on imagination rather than artistry.

Um, you know that the mechanism by which printing money increases inflation is by increasing the amount of money chasing the same number of goods right? It's not actually the issue at the moment as inflation is being caused largely by global prices rises. You don't have to increase your prices if you think it will harm your profits. The only time that would be true is if your supplier has raised their prices and you were getting pinched. Well, your supplier is likely one of those big companies making record profits because people like you are so willing to pay their silly prices.

&gt;      Shareholders have every right, backed up by law, to expect a company to maximise its profits.

No, you misunderstand that. They have the right to expect the board of that company to do everything they can *within the law* to maximise profits, and they vote to get people kicked off for not doing it. But they can't, for instance, sue the entire company for not being profitable. Investing is inherently risky, and part of assessing whether to take that risk is deciding whether the company is shit enough to need to worry about 'twattish' employees taking them to court for being shitty employers.

As she says nothing about spoken, we can't assume that her statement also encompasses the spoken language.

Also, it just wouldn't be very logical for this not to be the case. Not only would this mean that every Time Lord speaks English to humans(Which doesn't seem likely for a race that's so proud of who they are), but also it would raise the question of what would the point of even having such a function on a TARDIS? A TARDIS is meant purely for Time Lord travel. The Doctor is the only one that breaks this paradigm by bringing humans to travel with. So why would Time Lords build such a function into their space ships? I think it's obviously done so that they don't have to learn any language other than Gallifreyan when travelling and communicating with others. If it didn't translate Gallifreyan, then it would be entirely useless.

Think of it like this, if you went to France, you couldn't just buy a French dictionary. You still wouldn't understand anything in it. You'd have to buy an English-French/French-English dictionary, so you could translate what people were saying.

He should be relishing the challenge and showing a little respect for a team that has persevered with him through hours and hours of subjectively disappointing performances.

Despite this though, we've seen suggestions of him returning to top form recently and even though his goal scoring hasn't been prolific by any means, he has had a hand in a lot of goals this season when he has played.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"FSG has done some phenomenal work in the commercial aspect of the club. The Warrior Sports kit deal (3rd highest in the world) and setting up academies and football clinics in Asia point to this. Last summer's Asian tour was hugely successful, and helped the club regain their global presence. 

However, there has been no concrete work on either a new stadium, or expanding Anfield. Sure, queries have been made and proposals sent, but 18 months is a very long time for them to be making analyses and reports. Naming rights deals can easily be made while the stadium is being built, since I can't imagine any sponsor to make specific demands to the actual shape of the stadium. Actual concrete work on either a new stadium or expanding Anfield would really show the owners' long-term commitment.

On the football side, the owners have messed up so hilariously. Appointing Dalglish on a long-term basis was a mistake, and it was something that I was against all along. Sacking him after only a year is another big mistake. If they had appointed a whole new manager last summer, and revamped the entire infrastructure of the club, it would have been hugely refreshing after the Hicks/Gillett debacle. By waiting until this year to do it, they now have to contend with the new ""core"" of players brought in by Dalglish, fanbase backlash over sacking Dalglish, and incredibly unrealistic expectations on the new manager (if Kenny was sacked for being outside of Top 4, you better expect the media to be all on the next manager's ass if he does the same. Calls of hypocrisy, disrespect to a club legend et cetera.) 

The fact that it has taken weeks now to find a new director of football shows just how unprepared FSG are in this. They should have started scouting for other prospects even before sacking Comolli. A new DoF should have been ready to be appointed when Kenny was sacked, so that there would be some form of structure in the club. Right now, we are in the unique position of having only a MD, and a head coach whose future is uncertain. The owners have had weeks to replace Comolli. They have had weeks to prepare for the sacking of Dalglish. We are now officially in the off-season, and as everybody klnows, every day that passes in the off season is valuable time wasted. We need to scout new players, contact agents, contact clubs, make negotiations on initial price, negotiate contracts with the players, confirm final price with clubs. Unless they are world-famous players suddenly available for a discount (like Van der Vaart), these things take time, and we cannot work on it without a Dof AND a manager. With players going off on holiday, we need to formulate training plans, an individualised fitness and nutrition regime for players to follow while on holiday, settle existing contract issues, work with training staff regarding tactics and strategies. There are literally millions of things involved in running a football club, and although things don't grind to a halt without a DoF or even a manager, the appointment of these positions will require change in a lot of aspects of the club, and any delay is making it harder to implement the change. 

Granted, we are likely all being overly restless. It is likely that they already have a DoF in place, but wanted the news of Kenny's sacking to die off over a week before making any new announcements. Commercially, FSG have been a great success for us. Football-wise, they have shown by not having ready replacements for both Comolli and Dalglish that it is one big kneejerk. While concrete news on a new stadium will definitely assure Liverpool fans to their long-term commitment, it is the way they restructure the club that will really show if we are to regain our past successes.

true,btom14,lfc68,null,"Let me start by saying I'm by no means a diehard Red Sox fan, just a casual baseball fan. Someone else can probably explain in more detail, but I'll do my best: 

* Just to make it clear the Red Sox are not dead last in the league. They are in last place of their five team division with a record of 20-21. There is still a long ways to go in their 162 game season. Also, it's not easy to make the playoffs in baseball. Only 8 of the 30 teams make it in. 
 
* They are definitely struggling though. They choked BIG TIME last season and lost quite a few games in a row to give up their playoff spot on the final day. 
* I would say they've had a few of the same problems as LFC. In the off-season before last season they spent quite a bit of money to bring in Adrian Gonzalez and Carl Crawford. Carl Crawford in particular has definitely struggled along with several other players. This season Kevin Youkilis who was previously one of their best hitters has been in quite a slump and could be traded. 
* They are probably going to hit a rebuilding phase pretty soon, but I think you could expect to see them improve their play the remains and push for a playoff spot.   
* To conclude, I wouldn't worry about it to much, FSG definitely know what they're doing. Winning the world series is no easy task (just ask the chicago cubs) and to break a 86 year curse and then do it again a few years later is quite an accomplishment. Right now they're suffering from underperforming players, but they've still managed to maintain a really good team.

De Boer didn't outright reject the appointment. Saying something like ""honoured by the link, but I'm not looking to leave"" is just a way to keep negotiations open without burning any bridges. He has a good thing going on in Ajax, so he's not actively looking to leave, but if Liverpool can offer him good infrastructure, a good salary, and commitments to investing in players, he could still move over. 

There are quite a few things that point towards De Boer being a very likely candidate. Most of our links to Txiki comes from reports that we asked Cruyff for advise, who pointed Txiki out to them. Anyone who Cruyff recommends has either Dutch links or Barcelona links. De Boer has both. Ajax is a club with a very strong infrastructure, with DoFs working together with managers. It's also the same structure that FSG are going for, so why not get a manager who is proven to work within that layout?

From what I can tell, they needed a bit of a rebuild after the 2007 success but it must have not gone so well. US Baseball seems to use some sort of draft system, combined with free agency. However it works, I guess they didn't get the right personnel.

To be honest, without knowing much, I would be inclined to give FSG the benefit of the doubt. They seem to have brought major success to the Red Sox for the first time in ages. So what if the last two seasons have been a bit shit? That's what happens in sport. FSG cannot control every single thing that happens within the organisations that they own.

The great successes that the Red Sox have had under FSG ownership should outweigh the recent difficulties. FSG can't control everything and should not be judged poorly if some individuals within the Red Sox have been screwing up. What FSG should be judged on is how they handle the issues and whether their influence can help steer the Red Sox back onto the right path.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"TL; DR:  A few months of bad baseball don't wipe out a decade of historically great results and the ownership group may not be perfect but they are a damn sight better than many owners.

I'm a huge Red Sox fan but I was an LFC fan long before FSG bought the club:

The set-up in baseball is similar to the other major American sports and is very different than European football.  American sports leagues take significant steps to level the playing field and that results in teams having good and bad seasons over short periods of time.  The Sox made a few big money signings that were very popular at the time but have not really worked out and the failure of those players has dragged the team down.  Even rich baseball teams (like the Sox) have to rely heavily on their youth set-up, called the farm system, to fill their roster and the Red Sox, after a few very successful generations of players, are currently in a position where they have a few very good players a few seasons away but only one really good, major league ready prospect.  They had some serious injuries last season and at the beginning of this one and did not have the young talent to fill in their places.

They also had clubhouse discord last season that led to a team collapse after being the best team in baseball for the middle four months of the season.  They fired their manager and, in my opinion, disgraced the team by smearing him on the way out the door.  That's the bad news.

Now the good news.  They are in last place in their division right now (there are two leagues, each with three geographically organized divisions) but that's because they got off to a bad start and play in by far the best division in baseball.  The single best predictor of final won/loss record in baseball is total run differential and theirs is way better than their record, meaning that they will likely improve, just based on statistical regression.  Baseball is a very statistically driven sport.  That process has already started as they have won eight of their last ten and may be out of last within a day or two.  It is also a very long season and it is common for teams to come back from similar deficits to what they face right now.  So that is their position right now.  It would be VERY surprising if they finish in last (even just in their five team division), but because of their slow start and difficult division it is also likely that they will miss the playoffs this season.

Now for the best news:  over the past eleven seasons there have been NINE different champions in baseball.  It is not like football where a few teams can dominate for decades.  Only two teams have won more than one title since 2001 and the Red Sox are one of them.  Before FSG bought the Red Sox in late 2002 they had gone 85 seasons without winning a title.

The ownership has clearly learned the lessons of the past few Sox seasons and have handled Kenny's firing much better than they did Terry Francona's.  The person who is generally considered the slime ball of the Sox organization (a man named Larry Lucchino) is not involved with LFC.  The ownership group is always willing to spend money to improve on field performance and they learn from their mistakes.  Ultimately, as Martin Broughton pointed out when the sale went through, there are only so many oil sheiks with infinite money looking to buy clubs.

If you want an ownership group that will be committed to the club, invest as wisely as they are able and improve over time, then you should support FSG.  If you want a local owner who cares about the history of the club but can't regularly compete financially, or one who will just throw money at every problem, then you aren't going to like them.",0,1337587477,null,0,1337587719,0,c4qheg6,t3_tx6um,t1_c4qheg6,t3_tx6um,null,1428967652,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

This is actually not true. It may be a very small effect, and not worth spending the extra money on, but people do feel better quicker with fancy packaged brand name drugs.

I wish I could find the blog like where he talks about this - it's definitely in the book if anyone has read it.

Also while most painkillers are identical, just because two pills have the same active ingredient doesn't mean they have the same effect. They could be made up very differently and the delivery mechanism can be different, resulting in different effects on the body.

Although the manufacturing sector's share of both employment and the UK's GDP has steadily fallen since the 1960s, data from the OECD shows that manufacturing output in terms of both production and value has steadily increased since 1945. A 2009 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, citing data from the UK Office for National Statistics, stated that manufacturing output (gross value added at 2007 prices) has increased in 35 of the 50 years between 1958 and 2007, and output in 2007 was at record levels, approximately double that in 1958.[1]


This is a trend common in many mature Western economies. Heavy industry, employing many thousands of people and producing large volumes of low-value goods (such as steelmaking) has either become highly efficient (producing the same amount of output from fewer manufacturing sites employing fewer people- for example, productivity in the UK's steel industry increased by a factor of 8 between 1978 and 2006 [2]) or has been replaced by smaller industrial units producing high-value goods (such as the aerospace and electronics industries).

I talked to the estate agent about it - they felt that the landlord would not be bothered so long as I found a replacement myself and paid the re-signing fees (which the landlord would otherwise have to pay, which I agreed wasn't fair on them).  So I advertised the flat at the same rent as I was paying (gumtree etc)  and they double checked he was ok with it.  

The new tenant would be signing a new contract rather than taking ours over, so I guess the landlord was glad to get another 12 months locked in early (rather than someone just take the last 9 months of mine).  The new tenant had to sign the new contract before we were released from ours, so in the end I think we had 2 or 3 weeks to leave and find somewhere else.  i.e. new tenant signed a new 12 month contract starting in 3 weeks time and that automatically released us so we could find another flat for that day.  

We had to wait for them to sign because we would still be bound by our original 12 month contract if they pulled out at the last second.  (Unfortunately, fixed term contracts make it rather unambiguously your problem if you want to break it off early)

It ranges in quality from *crap* to *I wouldn't know this was supposed to be coffee if I hadn't pushed the button myself.* The other great thing about vending machines is that they can sometimes attract ants or, worse, mice.

Anyway, judging by the responses to my comment I looked up some figures on this and it appears that the UK is particularly unusual in the EU in that the coffee drunk here is about 15% ground coffee and 85% instant whereas in most other EU nations- including the ones where I've done the majority of my travelling- the situation is reversed. It was an ill-informed comment on my part and based on my own travel experiences. Thinking slightly deeper I realise that when I've visited countries that I wouldn't call coffee-drinking nations I haven't tended to drink coffee at all. There was an interesting comment in one article that suggested that preference for instant or ground coffee could be used as an Economic Development indicator. It pointed out that even in the coffee-producing regions of Africa instant coffee occupies about 99% of the market, in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe it's about 80% and in more developed Western nations that percentage generally- the UK being an obvious exception- falls away. I'm not so sure though, as I couldn't find any figures for South and Central America and suspect the differential may be due to more than purely economic factors- such as whether a given country has an established coffee-drinking culture as well as the convenience of instant.

I'm not sure I would particularly want to go to Burma though. It looks like a beautiful country but the government appears to be particularly dodgy- although that could be a misconception on my part. Availability of coffee wouldn't really be an influencing factor as I'm more than happy to switch to other beverages; however when I drink coffee- and I do really like coffee, I have a pot brewing as I type- I prefer a hot drink that actually tastes like coffee.

As someone who grew up in the 80's in the North East of England ( now living in London )  I watched her decimate whole areas of that place. It wasn't just the main Iron, Steel and coal industries she shut down for cheaper imports, it was also the whole support network of small to medium businesses who supplied those industries ( toolmakers, iron mongers, specialist machine makers, transport infrastructure both rail and road, maintenance, electrical engineers to name but a tiny few )   

Also the communities that thrived on the back of those businesses and the school leavers who naturally would have slotted into the apprenticeship schemes provided by these industries were gone in the space of a few years.  

Basically the kids had nowhere to go and no future ( one of the reasons I eventually moved to London ) and the communities had their future ripped from under them. 

I mean a lot of those skills are now pretty much lost forever and some of these places never have and never will recover.

If it wasn't for companies like the Japanese car manufacturer Nissan taking advantage of extremely cheap rates and a desperate unemployed workforce it could have been a damn site worse too. Most of the people I grew up with now work in bloody call centers up there, again because there's an abundance of cheap labour. 

Thatcher was thinking short term financial gain, she never even considered the lives of the huge workforce she crushed just so a few of her cronies could get rich in London.

It is true that there is no salary cap in baseball but it is still not like football where there is basically a free player market.  The teams are all partners in a single league, not entirely in competition with the other teams like in football, especially when talking about clubs from different countries.  Baseball's financial systems are very complicated so I will simplify some of this but here are the basics:

**The Draft**

* Each year there is a player draft.  The draft is a process in which each team gets to pick players for their organization from the pool of amateur players in the US and Canada (players from other countries are bound by other rules that I will skip over).  The draft is seeded so that the worst team gets to pick first in each round, then second worst goes second... and so on.  The Red Sox usually pick late in each round because they are good the previous year.
* Teams are not allowed to sign players until they have drafted them and players cannot enter the draft until they have graduated high school (17-18yo) or if they don't sign right then, until after their third year of college or they turn 21.  This means that you don't have teams able to buy up the best young talent, they can only get it through the draft.  The worst team from one season gets to pick the best young talent and then they control that player for many years.
* Once a player has been drafted the team has a right to keep them in their minor league system to develop for as long as they want (unless the player quits baseball) and then, when they promote them to the majors, the combination of their first contract and a process called arbitration means that they are nearly guaranteed to be able to keep the player for at least six seasons in the major leagues.  If a player comes up when they are 22 you basically get to keep them through their most healthy, productive years.
* This control over a player's contract gives the team that originally drafts a player enormous leverage and extremely productive players may be on contracts far below their market value.  The team can choose to trade, release or not re-sign the player, but the player basically cannot do anything unless they are willing to sit out and not get paid.  Many teams use this leverage to ""buy out"" a players early career years and gives them more money in those seasons in exchange for the player signing a longer contract.  The player mitigates the risk of an injury killing their future salary potential by delaying their entry into ""free agency"" where any team can sign them for any amount of money.
* When you take this together, a team that is bad for a few years and has decent scouting (and the scouting if of 17-21 year olds, not 13-16 years olds like in football) they will end up with a group of talented players with low salaries all maturing at the same time.  This is a big part of how ""small market"" teams like Minnesota and Oakland where successful in the 2000's and why Tampa Bay and Washington look like they are in good shape for this decade.  Teams that follow this model are generally ""boom and bust"" franchises because once they get good they lose their draft standing but once the players hit free agency they can't afford to keep them.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

That is how the draft is the major talent balancer but there are other things that the league does to keep super teams from forming and dominating.

1. Players under contract cannot be sold, only traded (unless the sale is &lt;$1M) and the player has no say in trades.  If they sit out, they don't get paid.  The idea of a player demanding a ""transfer"" is unheard of in baseball and the team would just tell the player to play or sit out their contract and not get paid.  Players do regularly get traded for younger prospects when their contracts are running out but the team has all the power in the trade so they can't choose to go to a super team, like footballers do with going to Barca, Madrid, etc. until their contract has expired.
2. There is no relegation so a team can rebuild without immediate fear.  A team can choose to trade all their best veteran players to other teams for minor league talent and then build through the draft.  A well run team can determine that they are not good enough and choose to break everything down, lose a bunch for a few seasons and then be back in contention a few years later.  This doesn't always work and badly run teams get caught in a long-term losing position but the structure is in place to pull this off and many teams do it successfully.
3. There is no salary cap but there is a luxury tax.  Teams that spend over a certain amount in salary have to pay a tax to the league on every dollar above that threshold and those funds are then distributed to the teams in the league with the lowest total salaries (or it might be lowest revenues, I can't remember).  The Red Sox usually spend right around the tax threshold as it is a prohibitive cost to go beyond it for more than a few seasons.  The New York Yankees are the only team in baseball that does not seem to care about the luxury tax at all.
4. Baseball has playoffs at the end of the season.  The playoffs are a sequence of best-of-five and best-of-seven series but baseball is a game where the absolute best teams only win 60-65% of their games so when you put two good teams together the best one doesn't always win.  That is why the team with the best record in the regular season usually doesn't win the championship and why there have been so many winners over the past few decades (as they have added more rounds to the playoffs).  The best teams try to make the playoffs year-after-year and then take their chances.  The stated goal of the Sox is to make the playoffs eight times every decade.

There are other tools that the league uses to balance the teams but the last one is inherent in baseball.  It is a game of huge numbers and fine margins.  There is a massive player pool and a long season (162 games per team) and the a last place team beating a first place team on any given day isn't even a blip in the news.  It is a game where a player who gets on base 40% of the time is an all-time great but one who gets on 35% of the time is average.  It is not a game where a team can run away with the title and, even if they do, they can easily lose in the first round of the playoffs.  That's what makes baseball entertaining and dramatic and great (the pace of a game is what makes it boring) and that's why it's rare to have a baseball dynasty.",0,1337594008,null,0,false,0,c4qhxb4,t3_tx6um,t1_c4qhxb4,t1_c4qhniz,null,1428967911,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I'd like to know where you got this info from.

Firstly, the 7 million figure is significantly more than most source claim - usually between 3 and 5.5 million.

Secondly, how is it calculated? Having visited Versailles a few times, I know that the crowds are significantly smaller due to you having to pay to even visit the grounds. This means that anyone who visits the site has to pay a ticket and be registered.

Buck Palace, on the other hand, is not always open to the public due to still being a Royal residence but the plaza outside is always crowded - mainly due to it being absolutely free despite the fact that there is usually some sort of pageantry going on. No tickets means no solid numbers.

If you did a real comparison by fencing off Buckingham Palace and Green Park and counted every person going in then I suspect the visitor numbers in London will be far higher.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"I think, Britain would have the most to lose by joining such a collective being that it would require almost all autonomy to be lost - of which, we currently have the most. Also, we are expected to be the biggest European country by 2050 in terms of population. This should also eventually make us the biggest economy and have the biggest voting weight.

The situation as it stands allows us to pick and choose what we wish to participate in... a situation which the other countries are slowly eroding by either excluding us from decision making, or forcing our hand. Something which doesn't do any of us any favours.

But I doubt we have to worry. If the EU fails then we will chart a path with the US. If it doesn't, then eventually, we will end up in closer and closer federation as time passes to the extent that ever increasing amounts of economic and foreign policy is decided elsewhere.

But personally. I would support it, yes. If at the very least it would be an interesting experiment. I don't think any sort of cultural or economic similarity is necessary for such a union to exist - in this case it is probably its greatest problem (i.e. West Germans are happy to spend federal money on East Germans, but not on Greeks?. They are all European after all). But it would leverage the EU to something a lot more worthy. A properly integrated economy may not be such a great goal for us, France or Germany provided we are always substantially stronger, as federal fund redistribution would see most money go to Southern countries... but this would certainly allow them to accelerate their growth. Then we have the EU enlargement, which will constantly see us grow and assist other nations achieve our standard of living.

What is best for us as a single nation state is sometimes very different than what is best for the rest of Europe. This situation is no different in any other country. Unfortunately, we are all far too parochial. As soon as we overcome that, Europe will prosper together, but not before.

It also skims over what price Scotland would have to pay if independence *didn't* work, as if the whole excercise would be an optional bit of fun that would have no ramifications or cost at all. In fact, it's the complete lack of problems to be found *anywhere in the piece* as long as independence is achieved that makes it look even more suspicious.

We have been mislead, and can say for certain that it is a shitty deal for the nation, with it probably being a net loss. The finances of the monarchy are very opaque; originally George III in exchange for the personal allowance (formally the Civil List) gave some of his land to parliament but significantly he handed over debts as well. We still haven't paid these off. Also he retained large amounts of land namely the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall. They also were given special tax exemption (income, inheritance, corporation tax I think), and the Civil List isn't enough to meet all expenses. The cost of security and transport is met by other arrangements.

To make things worse the 7billion£ of assets owned by the Crown Estates only makes 3.5% in returns which is woefully under the national average of above 5%, so there is likely some form of inefficiency and lost opportunity costs that need to be included.

This is, as you say, flag-flying and some measure of recruitment support. But there will always be tension between operational and non-operational activities and under these circumstances there's very very little incentive for anyone to extend the non-operational side.

Deciding ""Frivolous"" or not would require 2 conditions to hold: Firstly, that the skills / experience maintaining XH558 are transferable and useful on modern aircraft, and secondly that there are sufficient under-employed engineers around that having an additional place to practice would keep them current. 

For the first condition, there's been an unseen revolution in a/c maintenance over the last 20-30 years and this would lessen the transferability of skills (these days modules get pulled and replaced, they're not not fixed *in situ*). For the second condition, with the reduction in headcount (Austerity, you know), I'd be amazed if there were any suitable engineers sitting around under-utilised to the degree that could justify their employment in this manner. 

All in all, I think the term ""frivolous"", whilst certainly emotive, isn't inapplicable to this specific case...

EDIT: Ah, where I **was** over-extending was implying *existing* non-operational use is frivolous. It's not, it's on the right side of that line *for the moment* and long may that moment continue. Also bear in mind that both the BBMF and the Red Arrows have significant non-public (charitable) support which can and is used as an argument for their perpetuation.

Yes it does. Because they aren't swapping on a 1:1 basis. 4 working mums create the jobs of one carer and perhaps 1/10 of a cook and 1/20 of a janitor.  Those jobs are real, they employ tax payers who were a tax burden by being unemployed.

Working parents are providing an essential economic role - they are working, so are paying tax, they are employing people to care for their kids, creating jobs, and are creating and financing the next generation of tax payers, essential if you want  government services and the NHS in your old age.

If a business paid UK tax, used their profits to create new jobs in an unrelated field, and donated a couple of hundred grand into a scheme to shore up the NHS in 20 years time, you can be damn sure they would be granted a tax break.

(A 512 bit RSA keys can be factored in 73 days on a single dual core PC. Now consider that most servers are already using 2048 bit private / public keypairs ... that will theoretically take 2^1536 times longer to factor ... approx 2*10^464 days. No matter how much hardware you throw at the problem, as soon as you start looking at numbers bigger than about 10^85 you are talking about more atoms than there are in the universe).

history as a healer and wise man.  In other words, we got it from 
him.  This is a very silly idea and I'm consequently rather proud 
of it.

The simple fact the effect of maggie’s market was to make the pound expensive on the international market causing a 15% reduction in manufacturing that lead to a 12% unemployment rate, some communities never recovered and cameron’s reforms to employment law will result in a greater level of unemployment, I have seen 15% by 2013, so he is even doing better than dear maggie. If you want to find proof of this have a look at the ONS website you will see many examples of this simple truth. 

The conservatives are not a party of business or worker they are a party of the very rich for the very rich.  Just look at the policies that have been introduced, a cut in taxes for the rich (the top 1000 of whom have had their personal weather increase by £155 billion in the last three years)  and cutting benefits, training schemes and housing benefit to the poor.  This is only about taking money from those that have the most in need and giving it to the ones with the most greed.

The fact that some people have a belief system that overrides the simple and obvious facts at hand is a recipe for death and suffering for the majority in our society.   

Edit: typo - top 1000 not 100 (unlike Cameron and Thatcher I do try to correct my errors and be honest)

Would your skills with a soldering iron and oscillator make you a useful network administrator? Probably not; there's *some* utility in being able to make basic repairs to a circuit board, but 99.9% of the time you'd be operating at a different level, whether the most physical you'd get would be swapping network cables around. Most of the time you'd be sat in front of a screen and keyboard trying to work out which bit of the network had gone wrong.

I am given to understand that front-line and even second-line aircraft maintenance has gone the same way: the skills required are more diagnostic than repair, since the main task appears to be identifying *which* component has failed, then pulling it out and replacing it with a new one.  This applies even to the moving parts, as modern engines are designed to be fully replaced in the field in a few hours.

To translate back to your analogy: Useful maintenance these days *does* only demand that you can use a calculator. You'd have to explain what a slide rule or abacus *was* to these kids before training them how to use one, and whilst that would help them maintain the Vulcan it wouldn't help them back in their day job, as they're not the same skills at all.",0,1337604086,null,0,false,0,c4qirdb,t3_tuwtx,t1_c4qirdb,t1_c4qiioh,null,1435715530,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Even allowing for that fact that you've cited the Guardian as some kind of impartial news source

&gt; Perceived wisdom is also that manufacturing disappeared under Thatcher. If so, it was something that had already started. In 1970, manufacturing accounted for 20.57% of UK GDP. By 1979 that was down to 17.62% of GDP. By the time she left office, that decline had continued - albeit at a slightly slower pace, down to 15.18%. Now it is much lower, according to the ONS - down to 9.86% in 2010.

I never said it didn't decrease as a percentage of overall GDP. Productivity grew, it's just that other areas grew faster. Problem? In any case, I posted those stats to show that manufacturing wasn't ""deciamted"", it just shifted from being high volume, labour intensive, to low volume of higher value. In fact, please show me anything in that link that refutes what I posted.

Then what I do is *given all the angles* make my mind up. Where I try to identify a consistent theory which makes the least assumptions and has no contradictions. So essentially, if there's something important such as... corruption in the media. I'll do some research, connect some dots. When I have a provable theory which at the very least is as possible as the known theory/story - then I'll attempt to spread the truth. Then hell, a couple of years down the line, a succession of leaks and slips ups to the public might bring the media corruption out to the masses - like it did. And alas my conspiracy theory is reality. Why I'm so happy spread this idea, is because I'm not suggesting or inserting anything to anyone - other than to research things with an open mind and recognise the *otherwise reliable mainstream* sources are entirely capable of being wrong or used. 

&gt; It's impractical for any one person to do their own primary research on every top, or vet everything they read.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"Well I share your enthusiasm, as gigabytes of photos of XH558 from the last 3 years will attest.

But I'm really, really conflicted on the methods and costs associated with getting her back in the air and keeping her there, and I look at what could have been done on the classic aircraft scene otherwise - the opportunity costs of bringing her back if you will. To some extent it was right idea / wrong time as XH558 got flying just as the banks crashed and corporate sponsorship disappeared, but look what that got the Sea Vixen - another beautiful aircraft but years flying with a massive Red Bull paintjob didn't really do justice to the role and heritage of the aircraft. 

I'm the same age as you, and the problem we've got is that the cool aircraft we grew up with didn't win any wars[1], and didn't get into the public mindset in the way the aircraft of the BBMF did. And they cost orders of magnitude more to build, maintain, and preserve. But even there: there's only 2 publicly-funded Spitfires left, and 50+ privately owned ones. WWII aircraft and even 1st generation jets (specifically the Gnat and Hunter) are within the bounds of Rich Man's Plaything in a way that a V-bomber just isn't.

At some point we have to nod, hang our head, and just admit that the aviation enthusiast's market isn't big enough to keep all of these grand old dinosaurs going, and that we're going to lose some forever.

We don't need Hulk although if we bought him it would be a positive, with Hulk on the right, Mata in the center and Hazard or Marin on the left we could get some serious creative attacking force. However we need to make sure we don't go overboard. I would prefer some serious tactics and playing style being forced into the team. My preference being an attacking 4-2-3-1 with Lampard as a deep lying playmaker/attacker. The four in front and Mikel or whoever behind him would really allow him space to control the midfield, play balls into the attack and even make runs of his own. This would diminish his age as a factor and allow him to stay on.

However that being said, Drogba has to go. His last kick of the ball winning us the Champions league is legendary and he is simply too highly payed to come on for a few big games a season. Torres needs to shine as our center forward. I would send Lukaku on loan and make Sturridge the backup striker. This also means no strikers would need to be bought. 

Signings? A winger, Hazard. Maybe another youth playmaker/winger for the right or put Hazard or Marin on the right. Point is: sign a top class winger and a youth midfielder/winger. I think we have enough in the deep lying midfield with Lampard/Mikel/Essien/Romeu and even Luiz.

Defense is fairly good, hutchinson can move in as backup to Cahill/Terry/Luiz with Ivanovic sharing the RB with a new signing and pitching in at CB. And I think Bertrand is certainly class enough to replace Ashley, of course this would be gradual over the next season or two.

The reason this is such a big problem in my mind is because the education system we have is built around one-to-many learning but the way things are taught only works one-to-one. It wouldn't be such a problem if classes were things students were interested in because then they would put extra effort in to investigate problems they had in their own time, but because the majority of lessons I had were not of my own choice my interest was so low that the only time my issues were ever addressed was when I got one-to-one time with the teacher, which was rare.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"&gt;Great, now somebody is going to help her find something to do.

I wish it actually worked like that. In practice WRAG is the category where they put you for repeated reassessment until they can make the disallowance stick. The level of real practical help promised when ESA came in never materialised.

&gt;they are going to keep on paying her. Sorry, but what is wrong with that?

Nothing. The problem is that they inaccurately threw her off in the first place. ATOS medical assessments are very brief, made with no access whatsoever to medical records/x-rays/etc, often not conducted by a doctor and are based on a computerised decision-tree of questions whereby if a claimant does not mention a problem at the start then further questions that might bring it to light are excluded.

Thousands of disabled people are being incorrectly thrown off. This woman is just  the one that managed to make the local papers. The appeals system is practically breaking under the load of appeals, a very large number of which are successful. When the government find that too many people are winning appeals they change the rules of the points-based system to exclude more levels of disability from scoring (latest round of this was April 2011).",0,1337610086,null,0,false,0,c4qjk4x,t3_txdp9,t1_c4qjk4x,t1_c4qimfj,null,1428968675,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"Here's the thing, though. When you hit 18, you go into some sort of vocational training anyway: You've got to pick a subject for a degree, and that subject will automatically exclude some careers for you (e.g. there's no way a Media Studies student would be able to get a job in Optometry). 

But promoting the idea of ""Don't know what you want to do? Go to University for a few years to think about it, and come out with a degree"" inevitably promotes the idea that a Degree is always right and appropriate. And because you worked hard for it, you're going to feel entitled to a better job at the end of it too.

And that's how you end up with Nurses that won't change bedclothes, or teachers that need time off to prepare: they've been educated and brought up to believe that they're better than this, and they've got a degree to prove it too.

Proper vocational training - apprenticeships, good NVQs, the old BTECs - all prepared people with the skills *and the mindset* to go into a particular job, and gave them the best chance at doing that job well. Which, in the long run, is all that society as a whole should care about. 

This argument is all a bit Brave New World, I know, but there's a redeeming coda: 20 years later, it won't matter what sort of education you got. The good, clever, motivated people will have risen up, and will be better managers / higher level employees as a result of the experience. It's just possible that they'll have gotten more fulfilment and enjoyment out of the path too.

true,screensplitter,null,null,"I don't know about this school, but at my secondary school, and in RE/ICT lessons in particular, the classroom was a circus where the kids who plain didn't feel like behaving were dealt with and shouted at for the majority of classroom time. The teacher thus paid the most attention to them, and overall we learnt a lot more about what constituted acceptable ""classroom"" behaviour then we did about the Muslim faith, or spreadsheet design. Not that I had any desire to learn either of these subjects as a fourteen year old, but you get the idea. These were also the subjects I received the lowest grades in. Not saying that this wasn't partly my own fault, but it's interesting to see the correlation. 

Even when students are then divided by intelligence, you still have problems. I personally hold the view that if a kid past the age of pubescence decides school isn't important, then that kid can bear the burden of their own mistakes. If they want to fail, let them do it. But the thing is; teachers are suffering for their lack of interest. As the article points out, school higher ups and the dreaded OFSTED are obsessed with kids reaching objectives, checking boxes, and meeting a standard. As if that was ever what education was about. And these teachers will be criticised, and their jobs will be held in question for failing to make some can drinking, fag smoking fifteen year old show an interest he never will. I realise that's a bit of a gross generalisation, but if you've been in a secondary school within the past 7 years, you see how that generalisation is becoming the unfortunate norm.

America unfortunately has no decent newspapers, the closest to being decent are the New York Times and the Washington Post, but they are still pretty terrible. But, there is no newspaper that is as bad as The Sun or the Daily Mail, so it is sort of a trade-off.

I personally like the way that Americans are extremely friendly, open, and talkative to strangers, however many Europeans and the English especially find this uncomfortable, so you may miss the reserved persona of the English. 

Contrary to popular belief, America has a lot of good TV comedies, but the style of humor is still very different from that in England, so you may miss those.

I don't know where you are moving, but it is highly unlikely that it will be as walk-able as wherever you came from in England.

Many Europeans find the scale of the USA very novel. Everything in Britain (and indeed Europe) is basically right next door in comparison to the distances separating most places in America. So you may miss being able to drive for an hour or two and wind up in a different landscape and culture. This is of course made up for by the frankly spectacular natural beauty, so it probably won't be that big a deal.

One thing I have really missed are the TV game-shows and panel shows aimed at the generally curious, such as CountDown and QI and others. The only game-show here that isn't idiotic is Jeopardy, and honestly the show only exists now as a legacy. There is no chance in hell that such a show would be approved if it were pitched today, it is too transparently highbrow. 

There is a peculiar English eccentricity that is very appealing and comforting. America has its own sort of eccentricity of course, but it is different.

I love living in the USA though. It is a very large and perhaps surprisingly diverse place, and if a person cannot find a place here that they enjoy living in then I question whether their standards are realistic.

Key Additions:  
Vertonghen

A good young striker, but not one that we're all talking about. This will be a bit of Levy magic (not Remy, Damiao or Llorente).  
Hoilett or similar winger to back up Bale (who stays) and Lennon.

Coming Back from loan and making the first team:

Young players that will have a chance at some point:  
Button (3rd keeper)

So say you're in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and Housing Benefit, at £120 a week in combination. You could get a part time job for 20 hours a week at minimum wage, and earn £124 quid a week. Whatever you say about morality, you want to reward and encourage the person for doing that work, and reducing his dependence on the state. The case might also be more complicated, like a self-employed contractor who could earn £200 one week, and nothing the next, or a parent who would have to hire a childcarer if they went to work. Or for tax credits, you can even have a situation where earning £20 more a week means losing £50 a week in benefits. For many people, this unpredictability can be impossible to manage; it might mean that you can't pay rent, or can't feed yourself or your family. This is what people mean when they talk about the benefits trap. So it's better to say- whatever you earn up to a certain point, you keep a certain percentage to take home, and the rest will come out of the benefits.

&gt;Now explain how the Queen having no real power a) doesn't make your statement invalid or b) how your political definition rewrites the Queen's actual power in order for your statement to hold any water.

Well,

1. It wasn't my statement, so my statement is still valid.

2. Because by definition, being a Monarchist is prefering a *specific political system.* Therefore if you are a Monarchist you by default, hold it as a political opinion.

&gt;No, because the monarcy in the UK isn't seen as political, and holds almost no independent power. It's seperate from politics. You really need to research this yourself, as you don't appear to be aware of how it works.

Whether the monarchy *in this country* holds any power, is completely irrelevant to the definition of what a Monarchy is - a political system. 

Whether Britain chooses to be a fully fledged (The Royals holding power) or partial monarchy (The Royals existing, and being accepted as Royal but not holding power.) - makes no difference.

&gt;We're not talking about beliefs, we're discussing your application of political definitions to the UK and how you're applying a generic definition to the UK royal family which ultimately isn't correct.

Well, it is correct, because it's a text book definition.

Britain doesn't have a proper monarchy, it has a hybrid where the Queens power has progressively been stripped down.

But again, what one country does, doesn't affect whether being a monarchist is a political standpoint.

You may like to read the OCED Measuring Productivity Manual and then relate it to the PWC measurement of productivity, but the simple fact that you cannot see that this is a none argument means that that will never happen. 

The reason that this country does, in my opinion, have a broken society is not down to the poor or unemployed it is down to the parasites that feed off the majority and the idiots that fail to see that. 

As I sated the facts will never matter to an individual that just relies on a belief system, this fact is why I consider that a belief system, if you will excuse the poor metaphor, is what you will in fact find paves the road to hell.

But what about this- why not use well-performing volunteers from the older pupils, or nearby university students, pay them a nominal rate, from say £4-8 an hour, and use them as teaching assistants for younger students, perhaps in a workshop environment where they drift around answering questions. Rather than one teacher in a class of thirty students, you could have 4-8 TAs; the pupils might well respect young university students more than older teachers; and the students would get to teach their subject rather than working at Burger King.

Ah, I see - they (and the comment after) were by CA3080 - you're swaying from his point that I was answering, then?

&gt;1.It wasn't my statement, so my statement is still valid.

Apart from being unconnected with the thread.

&gt;Therefore if you are a Monarchist you by default, hold it as a political opinion.

Not in the UK. By default. That was part of my point. Use another country to make your point, if you want your definition to take preference.

&gt;Whether the monarchy in this country holds any power, is completely irrelevant to the definition of what a Monarchy is - a political system. 

Which wasn't what was being discussed. You can't use the UK monarchy to make a political statement, because they're not the same thing. It then follows that in the UK, a 'monarchist' simply means someone that likes the royal family. If you want to discuss another country then your definition will have more weight and relevance. But in the context of this thread, not until then.

&gt;Whether Britain chooses to be a fully fledged (The Royals holding power) or partial monarchy (The Royals existing, and being accepted as Royal but not holding power.) - makes no difference.

Which wasn't what was being discussed - apart from your latter definition meaning that making a political point based on the monarchy in the UK is a little stupid *precisely because* they're not the same thing.

&gt;Well, it is correct, because it's a text book definition.

A text book definition for a political system, not the monarchy in the UK.

&gt;But again, what one country does, doesn't affect whether being a monarchist is a political standpoint. 

Which is why if that's not the topic of discussion it's important to start your own thread, not hijack someone else's.  And because of the reasons I listed, your statement is untrue anyway. You're taking away context to 'prove' your point (and ignore the thread you've joined).",0,1337615121,null,0,1337616010,0,c4qkg84,t3_txagr,t1_c4qkg84,t1_c4qkcqe,null,1428969089,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,junkmanuk,english,WGC,"My mother was a teacher at my school at the time when they changed the reports from a written paragraph by the teacher to a computer based system where they picked from a prescribed list of phrases to critique the student.  No negative comments were allowed, and the sentences were all worded in a very woolly fashion to reflect this.

Hence the reason people came out with these statements such as 'doing ok but can do better' and 'can work to realise his full potential'.  These were all that were available to the teachers to use and from there it's got progressively more backward.   As said in the article - children aren't allowed to 'fail' now.

I also recently spent some time as a school governor and left when it became apparent that writing vague policies that emphasise covering the schools ass is more of a priority than providing access to information and education.  That's not to say it's the school's fault though.  I also know a headmaster very well and he's retiring shortly, publicly because he's getting old but I know that privately it's because he's just fed up of having to fight everything from the parents, who insist on getting legal about any slightest flaw in the school,  up to the Education Authority whose 'running a business' attitudes are so detached from the process of educating it's farcical.  Either corner he gets blamed for the schools failings.

Basically - what I've seen of the education system in this country fills me with dread, from the point of view of a parent and a governor and, by proxy, a teacher and headmaster.

Tottenham finished 4th in the Premier League which is normally enough to get into the Champions League, but due to a technicality, the winner of the Champions League, if they don't finish in the top 4, get a spot and 4th place gets moved into the Europa League. This is seen as the icing on the cake of hate towards Chelsea here for a lot of reasons. 

First, Chelsea are a London team. As Tottenham fans, we will probably never hate any team more than Arsenal, but Chelsea is probably the closest to Arsenal in that respect (maybe you local yids can clarify this a bit, I've always been under the impression that historically, it was Arsenal -&gt; West Ham -&gt; Chelsea, in order of dislike, but the West Ham thing might be more one-sided, but I could be wrong)

Second, Chelsea have gotten away with murder in some of our recent matches, in the form of horrible, horrible refereeing decisions going their way. In our last 4 league meetings they have had no fewer than 3 goals allowed that should never have counted, one for being scored from an offside position, and the other 2 never even crossed the line, so there's a bit of a feeling of a jinx with Chelsea, since they were all pivotal goals in those games too. (2 were in the same game and would have been Tottenham's first league win at Stamford Bridge in god knows how long)

Third, and I'm only speaking for myself here, but I'm ideologically opposed to just about everything associated with Chelsea. That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but they're just a very easy club to dislike. John Terry is one of the biggest cunts in English football, Drogba spent almost 7 minutes in one game faking injuries against Barcelona (although off the pitch, in all fairness, the man is a saint), Ashley Cole's always been a bit of a twit, Bosingwa's unibrow should be considered a crime against humanity, and in my opinion they're just a very mercenary club, my worst fan interactions have been with Chelsea fans, and then there's the whole ""hey let's spend all the money on all the players!"" shit they pulled when they started winning.

Martinez could be a very good coach, but not a single fan will go ""Hey, we got Martinez. Watch out, here we come!"" if they sign him. It won't be because he's a bad coach, but his name is not a source of excitement for a club like Liverpool. And that reflects on the players. Just look at how players perform when they work with Mourinho versus how they perform without him.

I totally understand the SAF example, but that was decades ago. And back then, Manchester United was no Real Madrid or Barcelona. Now when SAF retires, who will Manchester United go for? The Swansea coach or Guardiola? Whoever's the best. And it is what Liverpool should do, instead of buying a lottery ticket every year.

And, one point I totally disagree with is your comment about how even an average guy can succeed at Barca or Real with that kind of money. Money spending is the most difficult part of managing a top club.

Because you have to hit the bullseye on most of the money spent, otherwise you won't have the quality in your squad which would put you above lesser teams. Liverpool spent tons of money in the last 2 seasons, and where has those millions of pounds brought them?

So on the contrary, you need a winner coach because they know how to spend.

One other thing, why isn't Louis van Gaal a candidate for the Liverpool job?

**Players Out**
****

* Drogba - I want to believe Torres and Sturridge can handle the majority of games, with Drogba unleashed when we need a sure fire goal in a big game. There's a lot of sentimentality involved and that scenario would be probably be unfair to Torres/Studge. But I love him too much to suggest anything else.

* Kalou - I like him. He's not the greatest, but he works hard and never complains. He is the definition of a squad player and proper depth is important for a team that will be playing more games than usual next year with the Club World Cup. I say keep him.

* Malouda - Love the lad but it's pretty clear that his time at the club is done. His talents are not what they used to be. Let him move to wherever he wants and don't let the transfer fee get in the way, he's done the club some very good service over the years and deserves to play wherever he wants. Unfortunately I think a Malouda departure would also push Drogba closer out the door, they are very good friends.

* Essien - Hard for me to write. I think his time is done. I really do love him and will be devastated if he leaves, but he isn't the same player anymore. I don't want to say anymore.

* Bosingwa &amp; Ferreira - If we can bring in a young RB with potential, I don't see the point of keeping Bosingwa. He hasn't been the same since his knee injuries, and although his performances improved towards the end of the season, I think his time is up. Ferreira is 50/50, he's another good squad player who doesn't complain, so I don't have a problem with him staying in a purely depth role.

* Turnbull: Get out. We need a better backup keeper. We can't rotate Courtois before anyone suggests it, we have a solid #1 in Cech and you don't rotate keepers when you have that.

**Loan Moves**
****

* Josh McEachran (still too young and raw)  
* Lukaku (depending on what happens with our striker situation, but a loan to an English club where he can play every week is most ideal)  
* Nathaniel Chalobah, Ulises Davila, Patrick Bamford (see if they can cut in the Prem or Championship)  
* Asses Tomas Kalas, Jeffrey Bruma, Kevin De Bruyne and Gael Kakuta to see if they can play some limited minutes for us. Having a young CB available would be nice, considering how many injuries we seem to get at that position
* Thibaut Courtois, Ben Gordon, Patrick van Aanholt, Milan Lalkovic should be sent back out on loan. With the emergence of Bertrand at LB, the futures of Gordon and PVA will have to be assessed - probably Gordon will be sold.
* Yossi Benayoun: Could serve as Mata's substitute when El Matador needs a rest. Otherwise sell and get some cash back.

**Players In**
****
 
* CF: We may need a depth striker. Torres and Sturridge won't be enough to shoulder the entire load. Falcao (Atletico Madrid) is an obvious choice, as he's been lethal for a couple of years now. Fernando Llorente (Athletic Bilbao), Robert Lewandowski (Dortmund) and Gonzalo Higuain (Real Madrid) are also options.

* Winger: Eden Hazard (Lille) first choice, young with loads of potential. Hulk (Porto) second, good size and should be a sure success in the EPL. Good crosses and has a rocket of a shot. Alternate targets would include Iker Muniain of Athletic Bilbao and James Rodriguez of Porto. Tough to say how many we need now, do we play Ramires as a right winger still or move him back to the middle? Marko Marin is signed for depth, and Kalou might stay. Hazard could also play CAM...lots of options here. I think signing two more is a safe bet though.

* Central Attacking Midfield: It's unlikely for us to sign someone new, but if we get rid of Benayoun and want someone for depth at this position, I would love to see Kaka (Real Madrid) come in. Real star power, great talent, seems to be able a depth role very well, and could only imagine how happy David Luiz and Ramires would be with him joining up. I still dream of Kaka.

* Central Midfielder: If you move Ramires back to central midfield, I don't think we need another one. Lampard, Mikel, Ramires, Meireles, Romeu, Essien (?) - lots of choices. If we need a new one, we need engine midfielders, capable of driving the team forward. Yann M'Vila (Rennes) or Cheik Tiote (Newcastle) are my choices. 

* Right Back: Gregory van der Wiel (Ajax), Cesar Azpilicueta (Marseille) or Kyle Walker (Tottenham) are my first choices. Davide Santon (Newcastle) is my alternative, nice versatile defender capable of playing on the left or right side.

* Goalkeeper: Is Begovic (Stoke) still up for being our backup? Don't really know anyone else, but we could use an upgrade here.",0,1337618523,null,0,false,0,c4ql4t8,t3_tx84o,t1_c4ql4t8,t3_tx84o,null,1428969410,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Men drink lager (usually cheap shit like fosters, stella, kronenburg, carling, carlsberg) or beer pretty much everywhere (nights out and nights in).

Hard liquor is usually done as shots. Usually cheap shit - smirnoff vodka, or Jack Daniels whisky, tequila and aftershock.

Do people mix drinks - yes. That gets you drunk faster.

Typical behaviour is to get as drunk as possible, as cheaply as possible. Price is the key, and it's why everybody consumes the cheapest beer, house wine and cheap spirits. It's not really for enjoyment or taste - it's for getting drunk.

A common behaviour now is called ""pre-loading"" or ""pre-gaming"" which basically means getting drunk at home before you go out. That way it's cheaper, because prices in pubs, bars and clubs tend to cost more. So most people arrive at bars already drunk.

It's bad enough that a US attitude towards prohibitionism and Presbyterian abstentionism seems to have made its way across the Atlantic, without the terminology taking over too! ;-)

As to the questions - and I should preface that I'm a Brit with British drinking habits, but I'm not a Brit in Britain - so you might not want to include this as data for your study.  I prefer wine, all kinds.  But (good) wine is expensive, so I tend to drink mostly beer.  I don't drink many spirits.  I certainly don't drink them to get drunk, but I might have a (or even a few) decent shot(s) of Scotch, Brandy or (Cuban) Rum for pleasure.  It should be noted here that Bacardi is definitively _not_ Cuban rum, not by a long shot.  Not by geography (it's American), by ownership (a US multinational), nor by style (it tastes nothing like a genuine Cuban rum - I'd take a Jamaican rum by preference!)

When do I drink spirits?  Parties/big nights when I was young perhaps, but not for a very long time.  These days, and for ages, at mine or a friend's bar or house.  For pleasure not for intoxication 90% of the time.  I'd consider getting drunk on spirits only if I were seriously seriously in need of it and it was the only option.  It's a sin to waste good spirits (or wine) on getting hammered - that's what lager was invented for.

Do I mix them?  It depends what I'm mixing.  Good spirits shouldn't be fucked with too much, what Americans call ""well"" spirits (the cheap stuff) is designed to be mixed, and generally too rough to drink neat.  Here (SE Asia), the rich guys will often buy super expensive spirits - top end single malts or brandies (several $100 bottles) - and then 50-50 them with coke.  The purchase is pure conspicuous consumption.

I'd say yes, younger people have a very different attitude to alcohol and cigarettes, though it isn't universal on either side.  What I tell the locals here, which is true for a large part of my generation and the complete antithesis of their behaviour, it that British people don't eat when they drink.

Even in the most concrete areas of the city, there are still green patches. Travel to London and you'll struggle to find a square metre of grass outside a park.

For those who can't get there - text:

The search for a new manager is one of the most exhilarating and frustrating times to be a fan. For those of us who follow teams outside of their country’s top flight it can be a time of wild speculation, from the sublime to the ridiculous, the hilarious to the horrendous.
 
So, as I followed the inevitable rumour mill surrounding my own club’s vacant managerial position I always knew the names would contain humour and surprise in equal measure and had a good idea of what to expect. That was until I saw the name of one rumoured candidate. My initial shock and dismay at even the slightest possibility of this person managing my own club led to me to a dichotomy of emotions I hadn’t anticipated, opened a debate in my own mind, led me an unexpected conclusion and left me disappointed and embarrassed.
 
The candidate CV reads as follows:
 
Playing Career
* 66 International Caps, 35 goals, 1 WC tournament, National Team Vice-Captain
* 10 years top flight League football
* 3 FA Cup wins, League &amp; Cup Double.
 
Coaching Career
* UEFA Pro License
* International Head Coach for 14 years
* European Cup:
o 2001 Group Stages
o 2005 QF
o 2009 Runners Up
* World Cup:
o 2007 QF
o 2011 QF
* 2012 Olympic Team Head Coach
 
Bearing in mind my team languishes in the lowest tier of the country’s professional pyramid this CV appears on all grounds to be firmly in the realm of fantasy. Until you consider the one detail I have so far failed to mention.
I expect the vast majority of readers have already guessed the identity of the above candidate and can now guess where this little discussion is heading. I am of course referring to Hope Powell, current Great Britain &amp; NI Women’s Olympic Team Coach and former England Women’s Head Coach and of course a woman!
Having followed the English Women’s teams performances at WC2011 and the 2009 Euro’s I was more than aware of Hope, but it was this rumour that led me to further research her background and
credentials. When faced with facts the CV is quite extraordinary and were it not for the fact that her career was within women’s football, a CV like that displayed above would equal a Premier League appointment without hesitation.
 
And so, to the matter at hand……..
 
It is clear there is a huge gulf in the quality of the men’s and women’s game, of that there can be no doubt. But how big is that gap? How far a leap of faith could it be from the very top of the women’s game to the very bottom of the men’s professional pyramid? Let’s not forget that this woman holds a UEFO Pro Coaching License, that’s the same license as the best male coaches in the world, they don’t run two courses, one for the boys and another for ‘them girlies’! In becoming the first woman to obtain this qualification Hope Powell had proved, to the UEFA examiners at least, that she had attained the same degree of ability as all those who men who had gone before her.
 
What of course isn’t quantifiable by any exam, test or analysis is, could a female coach get the same results with a squad of men as she could with an equally talented group of guys? Would her gender prohibit the required levels or respect, attention and belief in her players? Surely that would mean the problem lies not in her gender but in the attitudes of the players?
 
And what of course of the spotlight, the pressure? In 2009 widespread media speculation linked Hope Powell with the vacant managerial position at Grimsby Town. The link was denied by all parties and in reality there had been no contact between the two. However that didn’t stop the story carrying across most national newspapers, predominantly on the grounds that the appointment of a woman to a professional men’s team would be a first for the game and equally, a seismic development in the sport.
 
And what of the fans? It’s no secret that during the tough times a clubs own fans can be brutal towards their own, oft saving the most virulent abuse for the manager. Could a female manager tolerate such abuse? How much time would a fan give a struggling female manager before reaching the personal conclusion that her gender must be the cause? Could fans really refrain from such sexist trains of thought?
 
Just how far has football come? Is the professional men’s game ready to accept a female manager? Are professional players now able to disregard the stereotypes? Would the fans give the new gaffer the same time as a male counterpart and could a female withstand the pressures of the media spotlight?
More importantly, in this day and age, how can it be that we are still asking these ultimately sexist questions, it’s not like I’m the only one surprised by this; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fkcgh.
In essence there are more questions than answers and, rightly or wrongly, it will remain so until a female breaks the mold and is given the opportunity to prove that it can be done. However, one thing is for certain, there can be few better qualified to do it than Hope Powell.
 
And what, you may ask, was the unexpected conclusion that embarrassed me so? Well it wasn’t the conclusion I found most embarrassing but my own initial reaction. Ultimately, I am not a fan of a Premier League club, my team has never even been in the country’s top flight, and here was an
internationally experienced, UEFA Pro Licensed Coach being linked with my humble team. It was pure sexism that had formed my immediate reaction, plain and simple and it was that revelation that was the greatest of surprises to me.
 
Who’s to say whether Hope Powell is the right person for the job but surely she should at least be given the same consideration as all of her peers on that UEFA course. If club owners and chairman decide she’s not right for the role on footballing grounds then fair enough, but a word of caution; make sure you’ve addressed your own beliefs first, as I have here, and make that decision for the right reasons.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"There would be a multitude of reasons that Waffuls covered. You could get into specific historical reasons.

My opinion (as a Yank) is that there is always a degree of hatred towards any team that is percieved to have ""bought"" a title of any kind.  Chelsea has an owner who fairly or not can be compared to a James Bond villain and for years bought numerous high priced players and coaches and deemed anything other than a Champions League victory a complete failure.

The Chelsea players aren't the most likeable, John Terry is an ass, Ashley Cole and Fernando Torres are prima donas, Drogba may be a saint off the field but he is notorious for all sorts of over reactions on the field (some call it savy play, and if he was a spur i would too, that said he isn't so it drives me crazy that every bumb he gets requires a stoppage of play).

All of this flies in the face of an organization like Tottenham, realistically Arsenal, Newcastle, Everton where (lately) the teams try to function without paying large fees and larger contracts to price out the competition. 

Additionally from what i have seen there was a major influx of fans who chose Chelsea simply because they were team with the big names and for no other reason, fans will always want other fans to ""earn"" their collective rewards over years of fandom, not just have it handed to them.

Chelsea is getting the brunt of it now because of the CL victory, even though compared to teams like Man City, Man U, Real Madrid, Barca, PSG, Malaga and Anzil they were relatively quiet in terms of buying last summer (Mata was the big signing, then Lukaku who barely saw the pitch, Courtois who was out on loan all year).

People like to believe an organization that earns a title through smart management and top play on the field. People will (rightly or wrongly) perceive Chelsea to have paid for greatness since that since Roman took control and its easy to hate a James Bond villain and his team of mercs.

true,Hibernian,null,null,"Nope. I even made a thread about it back here once. He is selfish and wastes a lot of time holding the ball on the wing when he should be feeding his forwards or at least looking to pass out of pressure. 

The home game against Benefica was a prime example of that. We had a lead and he was getting lots of good passes out on the left. But instead of smartly using the ball to create scoring opportunities, he repeatedly dribbled at his defender. So he coughed up possession instead of either maintaining it or taking higher percentage opportunities to score. Then Benefica scored and suddenly the tone of the game changes completely. Things could have ended very badly if not for Miereles scoring that beauty from 20 yards. 

This weekend Kalou was suspect defensively and if anyone else hasn't caught on yet, we scored the equalizer once we subbed him out and brought in Torres. And Nando, btw, played defense more aggressively than Kalou has this entire campaign. 

I'd rather dump Kalou and pick up a winger that is more of a team player and can swing in more crosses, especially if we keep Drogba and maintain such an intimidating presence in the air.

I prefer [real ale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_ale#Real_ale) or cider, but I also drink whisky, vodka or a cocktail at times.

&gt; In which situations do you consume hard liquor? (also mixed with other drinks)

Usually at home. Spirits are too expensive to buy out (I only drink decent ones, and neat) so I'll generally buy the bottle and have it at home. I tend to have a whisky or something when I'm relaxing at night after studying, make cocktails when I'm having a romantic evening with the girlfriend...

&gt; Do you like to mix liquors?

In what sense? I make and drink cocktails, but I'm not a heavy drinker - if I'm having whisky I generally won't have any other type of spirit...

&gt; What is the typical english drinking behaviour? Is there a difference between the generations? Do older people have another drinking behaviour than younger people?

I have actually been a bit offended by some of Moffat's choices in the show.  It seems like he enjoys disrespecting Season 1-4 any chance he can.  He first makes a character (Amy) who remembers nothing of anything that happened previously, essentially solidifying his reboot as completely original and ignoring the previous seasons.  But then he makes decisions like, having River say that the Tardis noise is just the parking break in ""Time of Angels"", or permanently deleting the old 9/10 Console Room in ""The Doctor's Wife"", and I'm pretty sure when River buys her Vortex Manipulator the ""handsome Time Agent"" who's arm it was taken from was supposed to be a reference to Captain Jack, implying his arm was severed off.

It just seems so disrespectful and almost mean to ignore what has been built up before you. I understand that he writes the show as if it was his now, and I suppose it is his to do with what he pleases, but Season 5 was so bad that I almost gave up ont he show completely, and Season 6 didn't do much to win me back. It's hard to overlook some things in the show that feel like an insult to me as a fan of previous seasons.

We're students, so that's fairly often - can be every night post-exams.  As for how much I drink, I've only blacked out once, but can get a little stumbly by the time I go home.

I know what you mean though! Luckily my job is in the Arts sector and I am very much into art, literature and music (I have been a poet since I was very young and I MC in a group) so I feel like I can make a difference in my current job. 

Just a heads up, if you don't like paperwork you might not like the police. I have a friend who was a beat copper in Ilkeston and he spent more time filling out requisitions and filing than he did getting into action. It was the same in the Army haha. 

At least you'd be doing something worth while though, as opposed to selling windows or some shit. 

I also fucking hated academia in the end, which is why I chose not to go to University. I'd have loved the socialising but I wouldn't get any work done under my own steam haha.

- If I am in a club on a night out the chances are I will drink lager, probably something that is trendy at the moment like Corona. Jaegerbombs or shots also.

- If I'm in a decent pub, restaurant or at home I'll probably have a guinness or preferably weizen. Or a gin and tonic.

- Sometimes I'll drinks spirits if I am out and want to get smashed, sometimes when I am being more normal. 

- If I am on the lash big time then I'll mix spirits.

- Drinking behaviour in the UK is more ""drink before going out, go out earlier and come home earlier"" than in Germany. I think that is probably reflective of licensing laws as well. Germans also pace themselves far, far better than Inselaffen when it comes to alcohol. It is rare to first go out at midnight in the UK in HH it definitely was more the case.

- The younger generations also have more of a culture of drinking games than they do in Germany.

&gt; Okay but what would be the alternative then, specifically? If you could please elaborate, I'd be interested.

In a nutshell:

* Democracy, although necessary, has two negative side effects: 

    i) As Robert Louis Stevenson put it, ""Politics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is thought necessary."" Or, to put it more bluntly, any idiot can get elected, and frequently any idiot does.

    ii) Political parties: I reject your argument, sir, not because it is wrong but simply because I'm on the other team.

* To be most effective, a revising chamber must negate the flaws of the law-making chamber without adversely affecting the benefits.

* So the revising chamber must contain people who are

    i) Wise

    ii) Non-partisan

Non-partisan is easily achieved -- no-one sitting in the revising chamber may be a member of a political party, and there must be no party interference in the second chamber.

Next we must define 'wise'. I would assert that it is the amalgamation of knowledge, experience, the ability to correctly apply critical thinking, and enough years (age) to consolidate the three.

The difficult part is to identify these people. My best suggestion is to go to all of the chartered institutes, that have critical thinking as a fundamental, and say, 'send us your top three'. So we fill the Senate with scientists, engineers, doctors, teachers, lawyers, ... People who can truly claim the title Senator.

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"I agree with you that Rafa won't be appointed manager.  All your points are spot on.  The owners are clearing out the shop and Ian Ayre is the only one left keeping the lights on.  I actually wouldn't be surprised if he is gone before the end of the summer too at the rate they are going.

The way they are dividing up management makes us very unappealing to most big name managers.  I see us going for someone who is tactically adept and suited to our style of play who won't have to worry about many other areas of the club that our traditional total club control managers have.  We almost certainly already have a DoF (or the two positions your mentioned) lined up and owners are just keeping a lid on things until they have the manager picked out.

All this news about interviews and who is being approached I almost feel like is just food the fans to allow us to come to terms with realistic expectations for who the manager might be.  It certainly won't be Guardiola, and throwing around names like De Boer and Klopp - were we expecting anything other than being turned down?  These guys (Rodgers included) aren't going to risk support from their clubs and fans to get in line for a job interview when they already have a pretty good gig.  Anyone being approached will go into talks knowing knowing what our plans are and who we have lined up for backroom staff.  

I guess the biggest question is expectations and our transfer budget.  FSG seem to have set the bar at 4th place by sacking Kenny so are we going to give managers one season to reach fourth and then show them the door?  Furthermore, will the owners give us the bankroll required to realistically be able to compete for fourth place and acquire the new players we will need for this new system they are implementing.   No one really knows how much money they have and I feel like given the Red Sox mediocre performances, heavy investment on their part in LFC will result in a harsh backlash from their Red Sox fans, especially if the Red Sox poor form continues this summer.  As much as I wish this was irrelevant, they probably are FSG's main concern above LFC.

* Most of the players who seem to be making anti-AVB statements seem to be either English (Lamps, Cole) or African (Mikel, Kalou, Lukaku?) - NOT claiming a correlation in any way. 

* The Iberian and Latin American players have either been quiet or polite/diplomatic (Mata, Luiz, and maybe Torres?) with the sole exception of Meireles - his reactions after the Benfica match might have been related. Again, NOT sure if there is a correlation. 

* I did not know AVB had a gag-order clause in his contract. If that is true, I can't wait for the contract to end. I'd like to hear his side as well.

* Most of the comments about AVB being divisive are pretty straight and clear with little to no chance of misinterpretation as such. It still doesn't explain WHY he would want to piss so many of them off. 

    Good man-management or not, it is surely common sense to get on the good side of your playing squad? 

* There aren't too many man-management controversies heard about AVB's time at Porto. Granted AVB didn't have to deal with an 'old-guard' - the average age of the 25-man squad was roughly 24 years - but I don't recall hearing anything remotely acrimonious about the guy from any of the players ever.

    How does the guy go from being a quiet, prolific achiever to become a manager who garnered so much hate? 

I must admit that in light of the recent accusations, I have found myself wondering if having soft spot for him is indeed justified. Every new piece of accusation seems to indict him as solely culpable for the club's spiral. And yet, he continues to maintain his silence - presumably bound by the gag order imposed upon him when he left. A lesser man would probably contact a good tabloid or a good biographer and publish (Yeah, read that as 'sell') the other side of the story. 

And yet, defying all such (presumably practical) logic, AVB continues to maintain a stoic silence.

The problem might be that Suarez gives the ball away frequently if some of his things don't come off, but the amount of the ball Barca get and their ability to get it back so quickly would make up for the even if he is having a bad day. I'm no saying they are going to buy him, I don't think they will nor do I hope they will, but I'm saying from someone who watched the all-out defensive display of Chelsea in the champions league, they might have needed someone who can turn defenders with extremely tight spaces as a striker (other than messi, who normally comes from deep positions or from the wing anyway).

Agreed on RE. In general I think the class layout should be less restricted, for example when I was doing my GCSE's, I had two English classes and Spanish and French; subjects I am not really that interested in (I like maths and am currently doing engineering), but were required.

I have no problem with English being required as long as it keeps teaching useful writing skills but it would have been nice (and encouraged more interest from pupils) to have a wider choice of subjects (i.e I could have replaced the 3 language subjects with IT, construction and economics, for example.)

In a small off-topic comment, if the school system is going to pretend having a foreign language is a big deal, they should start teaching one in primary school. Starting two years of Spanish when I was 16 was beyond useless.

He wanted to sell Alonso and buy Barry which is what started the break up of the team, although obviously he deserves credit for building it. His league record was nothing special given the money he spent, and he always wanted more money. 

His style of football generally wasnt the best. His handling of the media wasnt great either and by the end of his time it seemed half his decisions were made to try and prove the media wrong rather than for the benefit of the team. With a few notable exceptions i dont think he was very good at changing the game with tactical changes, he often seemed wary to make a change other than one he had thought of prior to the game, hence the usual 70min subs he made every single game. 

Obviously he had strong points too especially at setting teams up tactically to beat the opposition. But i feel Liverpool should be dominating the opposition not reacting to the oppositions strengths. 

He obviously made some very good signings but made many more bad ones.

Started learning French when I was around 11 - 12, so first year of secondary school. Then in Year 8 (the next year) I got the option of learning a second language subject, either German, Spanish or Italian.

That's right, all the school system taught us were Western European languages that would only be somewhat useful if we decided to move to France, Germany, Spain or Italy and seek work there... with Spanish being arguably more important than the other three combined as it's a spoken language in almost all of America (aside from most of the United States and Canada, mainly growing economies.) And at an age where it's really hard to start learning a foreign language, not hopelessly hard, just really hard.

You're right, this should be something taught in primary school and more relevant languages to today's world should be taught to school pupils.

As for midfield I think someone that can eventually take Lampards spot partnering Mikel and switch out games with him next season. McEachren is promising but most likely going out on loan again. I like M'Vila but he isn't rumored as a Chelsea target. Modric is the most talked about rumor, I'm not convinced and I don't think Sp*rs will sell to us. So if Modric doesn't happen Joao Moutinho is a solid back-up plan.

IMO Hulk&gt;Hazard. Eden Hazard is a wonderful talent but I'd rather him go to City and draw press attention to them rather then us. With Drogba leaving this is officially Torres' time to shine and Sturridge can be his back-up. Signing another striker will just hurt Fernando's confidence and make him feel like he isn't trusted. This leads to why Hulk is a better signing than Hazard. Hulk can play as CF or winger that way if Torres doesn't return to his 18-20 goal season Hulk can chip in a score goals. Hulk is also a better goal scorer than Hazard. He has 21 goals in 38 competitions this season. 

Players leaving: Drogba(farewell to a legend), Malouda&amp;Bosingwa(we can only hope) and possibly Essien/Kalou. I hope Ferreira gets a coaching job with the club. ",0,1337633271,null,0,false,0,c4qomd0,t3_txetp,t1_c4qomd0,t3_txetp,null,1428971190,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Defoe is much more effective when he can run off a larger striker, in a 4-2-2.

Even if Ade does stay, we still need another for cover. If Ade does leave, we'll need at least two that can play this role. Ideally, we could nab a striker that's capable of playing either role (much as Saha *used* to be able to do). Whatever the outcome, we need at least two strikers in this summer.

Anyway, you did make a point in the fact that unfortunately the curriculum tends to play major catch-up and not lead.  ICT teaching for example is about 10 years behind the times, and pupils struggle to find relevance in it.  Languages should have forgotten French a long time ago and begun Chinese/Spanish dialects, and we will regret not doing so!

But give teachers a break, you would be surprised how little of behaviour is in their control.  I regard myself very good with behaviour management but an entire lesson and hours of prep can be ruined by a single bee.

tl;dr: the curriculum is years behind the times but society has interest in teaching certain subjects, kids are bored - tough shit.

We go into these matches knowing we have Drogba and he makes something out of absolutely nothing. He gathers every aerial ball on his chest and gives it to the midfield. He comes back to defend set pieces and is one of the most common players to head them out. Every cup final we know we have him and he delivers unlike so many top players who cant perform against big teams.

This season he did look much more slower and generally shows sign of aging but fuck it! he still won us a champions league and could prove cruical for us in the future while playing less.

I am sorry but I don't want to rely on any one of our current strikers too. None of them delivers like Drogba, thats how we have been so great at cup competitions. We would have to improve the entire squad if Drogba leaves because he used to score from 1 corner or 1 Petr Cech lobbed kick..now you have to create chances on a plate for the rest of our strikers and even then they might not score.

For CAM, we have Mata already, but the talk of Kagawa was exciting, I would love to see him come in, and since he won't re-sign with Dortmund, they can't entirely hold us for ransom, however we will have to beat away the Manchesters.

Selling Essien would make me cry, but I agree, his knees obviously either aren't 100% or make him think about challenges too much, he simply isn't the same Bison we all knew. I would obviously love to see Modric come in at CM to truly begin phasing out Lamps if Tottenham would ever allow him to head westward, though its unlikely.

I don't rate Santon as an RB, and Tottenham would never let us steal Walker from them, but Azpilicueta would be an absolutely fantastic signing, as would vdW. We should keep Ferreira, I've said basically the same thing you did elsewhere, the man must me a lockerroom king because he is always happy to play his role, knowing he won't play, and he doesn't have some ridiculous contract. Plus, at 33, we would get less than a million for him.

Defoe can finish but he isn't a stand alone front man, he needs to work off someone else to be effective (also couldn't hurt if someone explained the offside rule to him).

So we need to find at least 1 if not 2 strikers who can fill the big stand alone role and possibly a 3rd striker who is a different style for cover and tactics change.  

I think we stand a very good chance of losing JD in the summer since he wants to play more than we are giving him the opportunity to do.

By whose reckoning do you have the **right** to destroy private property, simply because you don't like it and/or don't understand it? In fact, give me any good reason to destroy someone else's property by right without a decent rationale with evidence and reason.

&gt;No one has the right to experiment in a way that is not controlled and contained.

Do you not think that these trials has to pass stringent ethical and safety rulings and testing? The experiment is controlled and contained. For example, wheat self-pollinates and does not pollinate by wind or animal dispersal. Which leads to the next point.

&gt;GMO's pollute the gene pool of traditional non-gmo crops

You will need to qualify that with some citation of properly peer reviewed literature. Other than *magic* how exactly are you asserting that wild plants have acquired traits from plants that they cannot have sex with.

&gt;This also means that any contaminated plant is owned by the maker of the genetically modified plant.

On what basis, you would have to first prove that any wild plant had any copy of the alterations in the GM plant. Then whoever developed the GM plant would have to make some claim on wild plants. Utter nonsense.

&gt;If they want to experiment it needs to be done in sealed lab, not in the wild.

Says you. Someone with no clear understanding of anything that happens.

&gt;Before anyone thinks that i would personally burn or destroy these crops I wouldn't, but that doesn't mean i wouldn't be in full support of someone who is willing to do so.

Kagawa I don't think makes sense for Chelsea or him. We will rely heavily on Mata at CAM, why have two young ones? I'd rather Mata and a veteran (Benayoun/Kaka), I think it'd work out better.

I'd put in a big fight for Mata too, having Mikel and Romeu playing holding midfield next season, with Lampard and Modric beside them would be fantastic.

I think Santon is a LB naturally so maybe some wishful thinking. Having a sideback capable of playing both positions and having enough quality to be a starter would be sick, ie, Lahm. Any RB we do sign, I really want them to be defensively solid, no one dodgy like Maicon/Alves. Need a Cole like sideback.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I actually wish Amy was more realistically broken. Rarely does anything actually go wrong for her or she acts in a way that effectively portrays a ""broken"" character.

I mean, a character who met the Doctor and then spent their entire adult lives going crazy and being told he didn't exist. And then *just* as she makes herself believe that it was all in her head and she gets the bare semblance of a life together for herself *he comes back*.

*That's* interesting.

Have you seen Jumanji? You know Helen Hunt's character? *That's* what I wanted Amy to be a bit more like.

I wanted to see someone who seemed like they actually had gone through therapist after therapist, who lived an unstable life with no parents and in general was shunned by society.

I wanted the idea that the Doctor *really* screwed someone up and felt the obligation to help them and atone for his mistake, not just meeting an eight-year-old and exchanging for a twenty-something.

Amy doesn't act neurotic. She acts with a cliched sense of entitlement and irresponsibility, which would be fine if the show actually paid attention to it.

We're supposed to not think of Amy as a ""bad person"", so when she does thoughtless or insensitive things the show just glosses over it. They do this for far too many of the characters.

The key is to admit that they aren't always going to do the right thing. They're going to be selfish and they're going to be terrible, and guess what? People are going to call them out on it.

Gregory House is a terribly cantankerous person, but House as a show succeeds because they play off this. A lot of the reason people like Rory over Amy is because they show Rory getting kicked, making mistakes, being afraid, and in general being a real person.

Amy needed to be far less perfect and ""right"" than she is. At this stage she seems to be a totally sane and well-adjusted individual who just happens to be terribly bossy and prone to hitting her spouse. What she *should* have been is a very maladjusted person who never is going to be ""normal"".

Fourth point: Drink casually with friends if we're watching football, sitting outside on a sunny day, that sort of thing. That's slow drinking, for taste.

By around 2007 we had a decent squad and a very strong 11 but rafa still wanted the usual 10 in 10 or so out for a big net spend. This just wasnt required and he should have been looking for a couple of great singings every year.

I know people love saying how his net spend wasnt that big, but it was as good if not better than most of our rivals that dont have oil money. The comparison of players left at the club isnt a good one since it doesnt take into account money wasted. A team that has bought and sold shrewdly could have a valuable squad through good trading. Net spend and wages are a better guide for me.

He improved the team and squad the first few years but then he clearly started going backwards. When things go well for him he is capable of great things.

You're talking about hiring a venue and the staff needed to run it. You're paying for the transport of equipment and crew, along with accommodation and storage. Money needs to be spent on publicity, security, and insurance. Yes, a lot of these expenses would be incurred no matter the venue, but as I said it's a numbers game.

Which brings me on to the next point. NI has roughly half the population of Wales. However, the Cardiff audition isn't limited to people who live in Wales. A quick google search shows that there were 6 audition locations for this year's BGT - London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester, Blackpool and Cardiff - roughly evenly spread throughout the mainland. Given the relative ease of travel from any one point in the country to one of these locations - by road or train - this increases the potential pool of performers by a drastic amount. The population of Great Britain is approximately 60 million. Without resorting to relative population densities, that's around 10 million people per location. Even adjusted for population density, you're going to have far more people than the one and a half million we could muster here. 

As for the semantics game of Northern Ireland not having an audition because it is not part of 'Great Britain' - I'm sorry, but that's preposterous. Leaving aside the fact that there have been acts from France in the last couple of years, the idea that we would be excluded simply due to a rigid adherence to the terminology of the title is a nonsense.

I'm going to go through some numbers, and I'm rounding slightly to make the math more straightforward, but the point stands.

Our  10/11 season match day revenue was 43.3m GBP, given in the link above.

Now divide that by the 27 home games, and you get 1.6m per match day, in revenue. Divide again by 36K people per game, and THFC averages 44.5 GBP PROFIT, per individual in the stadium. Makes sense when you consider parking, seats, merchandise, concessions (food/beer, etc).

Now, assume our seating capacity was to increase by 20K from 36,000 at WHL, to 56,000 in the new stadium. That's now 891,000 GBP more, EVERY GAME. Our matchday revenues jumps from 1.6m to 2.5m. 

Assuming 25 home games a season, that would mean THFC could expect to make 62.5 mil/year from matchday revenue, an almost 20m GBP increase ANNUALLY, over the 10/11 total of 43.3m.

Math Breakdown:

43,300,000 /27 games = 1,600,000/game

1,600,000/36,000 seats = 44.5 revenue/seat

44.5 revenue/seat * 20,000 more seats= 890,000 more revenue, every game.

So basically, we'd have an extra 20m GBP lying around, every season, if we can build the bigger stadium. This doesn't include potential other sources of revenue like increased luxury boxes, naming rights, etc.",0,1337640423,null,0,1337640621,0,c4qq9gr,t3_txj5r,t1_c4qq9gr,t1_c4qm24i,null,1428971939,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

They have never been shown not to be safe for human consumption. If you want to talk about risk, as it is 'your profession' then you have to put things in the right context. You cannot prove a negative. 

&gt;To date, there have been no independent investigations into the long term health risks of commercially developed GMOs. Any tests that have been carried out have been done by the in house labs of the corporations that developed the GMO varieties, who have unsurprisingly found them to be safe.

Aside from them being grown and eaten for decades you mean? 

&gt;Also, GMOs do not produce higher yields. All the varieties currently under cultivation around the world are designed to increase profit, not yield.

GMOs are more commonly designed to prevent pest infestation, higher yields are of importance, but not quite as important economically speaking as preventing decimation of crop by pests.  If the only argument you can put forward is profit, then I suggest you have already made up your mind and are regurgitating what you have read on the internet. This I have no problem with, each to their own etc but I don't feel it should be done under the pretense of 'seeking answers to questions'.

Yes Lungbarrow said it! Why would you discount that? Why does everybody believe that Time Lords have 13 lives when it was only mentioned in one story in the classic series?

Rafa would probably achieve more with the current squad without making an overhaul than several other managers might.

He will mature over time but right now his decision making is costing him. He has immense skill so these problems will gone as he gets experience. 

The solution to this is to let both Cahill and Luiz rotate aside Terry to learn from him. Then when Terry hangs his boots we will have these two immense defenders at the back with Ivanovic at right back continuing the legacy of the great Chelsea wall. With Bertrand on the left back position this back four will prosper.

Right now the best back four is:

**Ivanovic--Cahill or Luiz--Terry--Cole**

Ivanovic is also very good as a center back and would not sweat a bit if he has to play there in which case Bosingwa can take his place as the right back.

So what we need to focus on is to keep these players in the squad and to not lose one of them to make space for mediocre defenders. This is the mistake which brings down the quality of squads (i.e Liverpool, Arsenal, Villa). Barcelona is interested in Luiz. Ivanovic will again receive offers.

true,purpone,lfc68,null,"&gt; He first fell out with our previous owners because he wanted full control of the Academy.  &gt;Later on, he had issues with how he did not have absolute power over transfers.

He fell out with the previous owners because they were sucking money out of the transfer budget and forcing him to sell players in order buy new ones. Did the previous owners ever give a crap about the academy? I don't remember being a issue at all.

&gt; His personality shows that he does not suit working within the structure that the owners are proposing.

He has a low tolerance for bullshit.  ""I was hoping for a sofa [a defender] and they've brought me a lamp"" - Rafa. Does Mourinho have a pleasant personality? He got the Real Madrid general manager kicked out. I think we should let the owners figure out if Rafa is a crazed control freak.

&gt;Currently, we don't have a passer like Xabi. We have Carroll, who isn't &gt;the most mobile of strikers. We also have Downing, an out-and-out &gt;winger. The current team is grossly unsuited for Rafa's style.

I don't even know how to make sense of this, Carroll isn't mobile, but isn't suarez? bellamy?. You're saying there is absolutely no tactical system Rafa can come up with that would work with our current squad? How is our current team unsuited for Rafa's style? What is Rafa's style? I remember us playing both attacking flowing football and defensive counterattacking football at different occasions under him.

&gt;Rafa found time to sneak in snide remarks last time he was here, the &gt;owners cannot run the risk of having Rafa turning the fans against &gt;them if there is any internal conflict. 

Snide remarks? The previous owners were sucking the club dry, mounting debt on it. If the owners do that I would WANT the manager to side against them. The fans didn't start protesting because Rafa told them to, they did it because they realized what was happening to the club. Rafa is beloved by the fans, but I don't think anybody would protest him getting sacked if the results were shite despite investment by the owners just like there weren't any people in the streets when Kenny left.


&gt;They want someone the fans will support, but not someone whom the &gt;fans will side with against the administration.

They will want someone who can WIN. And they can do a lot worse than somebody with two La Liga titles and a European Cup.

He played right back against Spurs when we drew them 0-0 late in the league this year. It was awful! Everybody on here stopped suggesting it, it was *that* uninspiring. 

David Luiz is a centreback. Does he play every game perfectly? No. But he's young, he's learning and he's improving. 25 is young for a defender. It takes years to learn the defensive side of the game, to get the positioning, timing and instincts right. It's certainly getting better; the number of mistakes is steadily going down and will continue to do so.

He is very much quick to leap out and tackle, but when paired up with someone like Cahill, it works well. Cahill typically hangs back and sweeps up any attacks that have penetrated through the other defensive lines. If we had two CBs who typically dropped back we'd be inviting too many long shots that might prove to trouble Cech too often. It's all about the understanding of the CB pairing, I think we've seen Luiz play much more reserved when paired with JT.

It's also pretty common for there to be a ""breaking in"" period for new players in the Premier League; Lucas Leiva and Ramires are two prime examples. Lucas plays a much more defensive role than Ramires and has taken a lot longer to adapt. But both players are crucial to either team now, and so long as we stick with Luiz and play him in his natural position, he'll blossom into one of the world's best, just like our little Rambo.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well agreeing to hear you or someone else out, always. I don't think I'm ready to agree with you on your ideas yet though, as firstly since you've defined democracy as merely necessary. (I could be just reading a casual tone, here and if that's not intentional forgive me, but if true I'd say it [democracy] is fundamentally important in any governance for it's legitimacy and for it's strength and longevity.)

I must make it clear I have no love for political parties. I think it was George Washington who made a point about loathing their structure while American politics was becoming factionalised. They often provide a simplistic stepping stone to being involved in governance for all the wrong reasons, namely being career orientated and further they often close their circles against people who appear to be of a different logo. However, I see a practical benefit to them to, they often bring compromise and pool ideas together. 

Yeah, it would be lovely if a chamber were filled with adequately brilliant academics and theoreticians, of course that is why you appoint advisors. How they do that, I often have trouble with and how they're eventually got rid of and why even more so (if they've broached controversy for the wrong reasons politically). 

What you seem to have in mind is a council of elders sort of thing, I gather, which while nice I don't think carries the same weight if they're dealing with local issues or something inanely simple that are often broached in certain bills that contain aspects of life a bit beyond their means and experience.
 
Moreover I'm still a little worried about how they're going to be appointed, it's a little vague. Which chartered institutes? And how - internal elections or external appointments? Can I or anyone else have a say?

I thought about going to extremes here and joking with you that if we were to appoint anyone ideally I think a random pool of people from all backgrounds would be appropriate.

Yeah the CM could've been neat. I like the Looms. And either way, they're there.

And if CM is ""no more canon than the IDW comics"" you can't really use *The Forgotten* comic as an argument if you don't consider it part of *your* canon.

Which brings me to my next point that there is no official canon. Canon is actually something with a specific meaning akin to that of a legal term. That an official authority on the show, of Doctor Who in this case, declares something as ""canonical"". I put that in quotes. THe BBC has never used the word ""canon"" to describe an aspect of the show. It purposely doesn't do so. Nor does Steven Moffat or RTD or any classic Who showrunners. The closest the BBC have come to canon is to say that something ""actually happened"" Which isn't the same- that's continuity.

Canon isn't the ""general consensus of what happened according to fans"". It's an official declaration. Like what George Lucas does for Star Wars.

We don't want the man that scored the winning goal at the Nou Camp to feel left out do we? If Hulk is the preference over Hazard, then he can play on the left (he's left footed anyway). 

With Drogba's departure confirmed, and Torres publicly questioning his future with the club, this is the time to make Nando comfortable. Yes, we could buy more strikers this summer (Falcao, Higuain rumored), but we shouldn't. 

Other than that:

I think the trio of Terry, Luiz, and Cahill alternating as the center halves will be solid. Cole is still great on the left, and he can help mentor Bertrand as his eventual replacement. The right fullback is the only question mark. Ivanovic was good this year (statistically the best RB in the EPL), and he can play in the center as well, but he's not an everyday RB. I think we need to pick up a young full back to start rotating in. 

I'm not totally thrilled with Mikel/Meireles/Essien as the holding MF (I've just never liked any of them personally). Someone has to do the dirty work I guess. I like Romeu, but he is a year or two away yet I believe. 

I think Lampard as the CM (true number 8) will be great for him. He's definitely slowing down, but he can show bursts of pace and can still play great balls to the front 4. Meireles can also rotate here.

Then, the BBC books for the New Series, which I don't follow actively but are designed to work with show continuity; then, DWM comics and IDW comics, but just as stories.

I tend to ignore the Virgin New Adventures and Past Doctor Adventures because they all revolve around the Cartmell Masterplan, which I take issue with in their execution, and which I feel the show fails to support. I just don't find the Cartmenll masterplan particularly engaging. Oh, and the Marvel comics for the Fourth Doctor, because General Ironicus is the best.

I liked Looms, too, in the abstract, but I feel like their conceptualization reeks of a bad writing idea - that the Time Lords need to be weirder and more alien. I think that the Time Lords are compelling because they're so damn human in almost every way that matters: Petty, foolish, and absolutely brilliant. That's why the Doctor feels so attached to humanity, in my opinion; they're just like Time Lords, except not so overpowered that they become stuffy pricks. The Looms other-ize the Time Lords, which I find to be a bad thing. Also, the Looms don't really make much sense. Why do they have to weave biological adults? I'd be a fan if they wove children. They only need to exist because they *wrote in* a reason (the curse), not because the Time Lords really needed to be different.

In the reboot with RTD, look at Wilfred, a secondary character who you feel a connection to even though he wasn't riding around with the Doctor all the time.  Just going on adventures can be fun for a while, but only if you care about the characters, and I definitely have no connection with/ don't care about Amy, Rory, or River.

One particular teacher, who I knew as Mrs. Bradley, taught photography at my school (she was a part of the art department), but she was also our main tutor for a few years. She was absolutely lovely. She sat down and talked with us about our lives, and told us about hers. She was always there for us, and I really valued that. She was a beautiful soul in a way, though I was too young to understand such things at the time. When I was in my 12th year at that school, she took her own life and we attended her funeral. I couldn't even process how somebody so wonderful would want to take their own life. I still don't understand it. But I'll always remember her. For her, teaching could've merely been a job, but she genuinely cared for us, reached out for us and I felt her glowing soul when I was in the room with her. 

The way schools are run right now isn't right. The one-to-many style doesn't work for most children. I absolutely *hated* school as a kid because to me it felt like I was simply lost in a sea of other kids who alienated me for the most trivial things, such as what shoes I wore or what music I listened to. Teachers were usually distant and stressed and I couldn't exactly blame them for that. It's no wonder I skipped school at least once a week, I hated being there, I felt more alone there and I didn't feel like I was being educated much at all. More teachers ought to exist, and teaching a smaller, more concentrated group of children each week. The number of subjects should decrease, but made to cover more areas. I had a different teacher for physics, chemistry and biology but a single science teacher could've sufficed. I had two teachers for English literature and English language, but again, one could've sufficed. Just a billion teachers, who also had a billion students, so of course very few could make time for me alone if I had an issue. They'd have barely known me among the hundreds of other kids they had to teach on a day to day basis.

The solution of course, requires more people wanting to go into the teaching profession, to teach the increasingly overwhelming amount of children who need an education. This needs an incentive. Teachers work many hours, get paid very little and it's frankly a thankless job for them. Ultimately, they suffer and students suffer too.

Now I have a more loose idea of my personal canon- I just vaguely assume in my head somewhere that *everything* fits together in one cohesive non-contradictory universe that can be explained. I may not know it, I may never know how two seeming contradictory things happened (perhaps because I do not have all the facts and may never will), but they can be reconciled.

I don't bother wondering about how Atlantis can fall three times or where UNIT is in the timeline. I just know in my head that it has been explained by something somewhere. Even if it's never been told about in our universe.

I don't think that the Time Lords were given looms just to be ""weird and alien"". The Time Lords are the mysterious all powerful race of the protagonist of our wonderful franchise. Why would a writer not take the chance to be creative and ""out there""? Why squander the opportunity? And indeed Marc Platt does really good on the cultural layering. The Otherstide, the mystery plays, the time of Chaos, Pythia, the invention of Looms, kithriarchs, sentient houses, giant furniture. All these little details are part of the culture.

And the wonderful thing is that despite all their alien aspects, the Time Lords are still foolish bureaucratic jerks with brilliant technology. That even with all their alienness, the Doctor still sees the similarity in humans and Time Lords.

I guess I just *like* how the Looms other-ize the TLs. It's not too much for my tastes- I can still see the human touch.

They don't have to weave biological adults- as far as I know. Who knows, maybe there's a sciencey reason. Mine not to ask why. And of course the Looms exist because of Pythia's curse. That's not bad. It's giving the culture more history and background. It's showing the reason for one of the biggest aspects of the culture. It's cool to think that once the Time Lords had normal single lifespans like humans and that all they did was manufactured- yet now it's truly part of the newer Time Lords.

I just really like it all.

But he spent a lot of money by any standard other than the mega rich clubs. Comparable or more than spurs, arsenal and man u over his time. It ended up with us being 7th, playing desperate football and not having recovered 2 years later.

It certainly wasnt all his fault and i think especially in the last couple of transfer windows he may have been deceived on how much he had to spend which led to him getting caught out. Im sure he thought he had more to spend after Johnson and Aqua, but then realised that was his budget. But i put half that blame on him for not communicating well with the owners. 

I just dont think that rafa was the miracle worker he is often made out to be on here and elsewhere. Personally i want to see liverpool play entertaining passing football as much as winning trophies. I dont want liverpool to be a laughing stock to the media either (something even Kenny was struggling with).

Arse and the Mancs had entrenched scouting networks at that time, and a very systematic back office that would close deals professionally. Compared to our recruitment team that dilly-dallied and almost always lost out.

Johnson and Aquilani were supposed to be part of a new approach at Liverpool - shorter, less direct passing, more movement. The mistake was Aquaman's medical clearance.

It's a round about way of complaining that wealthy new owners are able to build teams that can challenge the traditional super-powers of Man U's, Real's and Barca's of football. Every major club in England has a wealthy backer. I think the guy should look at how the Premier League has changed in the last couple of seasons and how clubs like Newcastle and Stoke can still compete with limited owner infused  budgets against clubs that continuously challenge for the Champions League (From 2002-12, 7/10 finals feature a PL club, when you take away Chelsea (source of argument) its still 6/10 finals). The success of these clubs is not just rooted in the wealth of their owner, but also in the product that's the PL, including the wealth that is brought in through the product. Look at Barca and Real they are not backed by ""wealthy"" owners but continue to dominate because the league structure is slanted to their favor so they can have endless revenue. The argument that new wealthy owners are going to get bored and leave, is baseless and only speculative at best... Most clubs in England are owned by 1-5 owners,  and only a handful have declared bankruptcy and I have not heard of any owners whom got bored  and left (excluding Blackburn of which they are just absent owners).

true,ax4of9,null,null,"You know all the front office changes that FSG want to make now? The best time to have done it was last season. The club was on a high in terms of morale. Performance in the 2nd half of the season was great. The doom and gloom of previous years had been lifted, and there was great enthusiasm towards the new owners. It would have been easy to recruit people eager to join the new project at Liverpool, especially with the prospect of a big transfer kitty. 

Instead, they succumbed to the media and the fans and signed Dalglish. There would have been no problems ending the relationship then, or pushing Kenny back into the ambassadorial role which he had kept previously. They gave him a 6 months contract, and 6 months was up. Kenny wouldn't have badmouthed them, just like he didn't badmouth them this time. Everything would have been cordial, nobody would have needed to be sacked, and the fans would still be happy. 

Now, we have to deal with the fact that an Anfield legend has been somewhat alienated, a big proportion of fans are unhappy at how the club didn't even give Kenny the ignominy of a ""parted ways by mutual consent"", the team's morale has taken a hit, and performance is poor by comparison. Any incoming manager will now have to contend with Kenny's buys whether they want it or not, because after such a season it is unlikely that we will be able to offload the likes of Downing and Carroll for anywhere near the price that we paid for them. 

There is no good reason why the next manager should be given more time than Dalglish. You have to bear in mind that Dalglish was given less time than Souness. Graeme FUCKING Souness was given more time to wreck our club than Dalglish was when he gave us an Europa place. Remember that.

While Bentley, Bassong and maybe Jenas could fetch as little as 3m (though I'd hope closer to 4m), and Khumalo's fee will be negligible, Dos Santos was subject to an 11m bid last summer - I think we can expect to fetch close to 7-8 for him, as for some reason lots of people still rate him. Corluka is a full international of recognised quality, only 26 years old and will start for Croatia this summer at the Euros - even if he doesn't stand out he has to be worth 8m, more if he has a really good tournament.

Pineaar may be 30, but he's been on fire for Everton and has a few years of contract left with us - I fully expect us to get 6m out of Moyes for him, as they're apparently desperate to have him back their permanently. Defoe is much the same - surely there's a host of PL clubs that'd bite our hand off for a striker like him for 8-10m, even at 30. And Gomes is surely worth 5m too.

I'd say 45m is a pretty conservative estimate for that group of players.

This fits well currently for Lamps, Mata, Torres, Mikel. Ramires isn't an out and out winger but hes one hell of a wide midfielder...I just don't see him starting when Marin and De Bruyne come in though.

If we go with the 4-3-3 we've been using for years, it would suit Torres, Marin, De Bruyne, any other winger we have, Mikel, Lampard, Ramires, Meireles etc, but wastes Mata's influence in the middle, which is a HUGE loss.

If we use 4-1-4-1, this brings out the potential of so many of our players I feel. Much like the 4-2-3-1 we use currently, but instead of 2 very deep lying central midfielders, we have 1 deep lying midfielder (Mikel /  Romeu) and 2 midfielders higher up in the middle at where Mata currently plays. I feel in this formation, unlike 4-3-3, the 2 midfielders aren't as central, which brings out the best in Mata, Lamps, Ramirez, De Bruyne etc and the wingers aren't so high up the pitch that it could isolate our Strikers from the entire midfield.

This whole debate is all very much dependent on how well the next manager does.  If he hits the ground running and Liverpool is successful no one will care about this offseason, but there will definitely be pressure on Dalglish's successor (and rightfully so) because Dalglish was given such a short leash.

I like Kenny, and thought he should be given another year, but that is all hindsight now.  There are a lot of very good/promising managers that I would love to see at Liverpool, and more than anything I am excited for the future.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"&gt; Mata, Modric, Meireles were AVB's recommendations. Not sure about Courtois and Romeu. AVB also wanted Moutinho, Alvaro Perreira and Hulk but they didn't work out and neither did Modric, as everybody knows.

I've heard Mata was an Emanelo influenced signing, and that Romeu was AVB's. Not sure about Meireles, he allowed him to leave Porto...why would he then want him at Chelsea? Alongside his replacement, Moutinho no less? Meireles as I remember was a backup plan if Modric failed, not a primary target.

&gt; A lot of the Chelsea youth are purchases done on the recommendations of Emenalo ... AVB was left to work with a squad that couldn't work with his system.

He wanted to completely refresh the squad...that's ludicrous. There's plenty of quality in this side already and buying a totally new squad is a bad idea. Not sure why over-priced is in quotes there, Modric at 40 mil was over-priced, and the chances of buying three players from a club from whom we just signed their coach (and pissed off in the process) and who sold their best player (Falcao) was always going to be unlikely at best. I think those were just the typical transfer rumours normally associated with a coach who's just moved to a new team. See Ancelotti and the Gattuso/Pirlo rumours for Chelsea. If they weren't, it was a pretty poor transfer policy from AVB.

&gt; One conspiracy theory is ...

I don't believe any of this theory. The impression I get from the club, Roman and Bruce Buck included, is that AVB was highly regarded and the decision to fire him was difficult and still regretted today. Roman was really left with no choice when it come down to firing AVB. He was willing to drop 40 million on Modric, a massive amount of money for that player; Tottenham refused to sell, that's why it didn't happen. Perreira was a replacement for Zhirkov, capable of playing anywhere on the left wing. Moutinho and Hulk were not going to be sold by Porto in a summer transfer window that included the departures of AVB and Falcao, two massively important players to the club. That's why Hulk's buyout clause was set at 100 million; they don't expect it to be met, they just didn't want him to leave last summer, it'd have been too much change for the side. Sturridge proved to be a good EPL player when he was out on loan and was rightfully given a chance at Chelsea.

&gt; AVB's project ...

We bought Torres to score goals so yes, that was likely a part of his strategy. Lukaku was bought for the future. Because of FIFA registration restrictions (you can only register for two teams in a season), he was forced to spend this year with Chelsea. We wanted to loan him out, he hasn't failed to live up to expectations. He's 18, give him a break. 

I don't see AVB's transfer policy at all responsible for the friction at Chelsea. He made a lot of strange choices and from what I hear, completely failed to communicate with the players. Sure he's the boss and can make these decisions, but to not explain yourself or your vision? That's crazy. Lukaku has said he was played on the wing in training. To move a player whose physique was made for the centre-forward position out to the wing, with zero explanation, is mind boggling. The Lampard feud was public and embarrassing for everyone involved, but Lamps did say he wouldn't have a problem with being on the bench so long as Chels were winning, and I believe that. AVB seemed to play favourites with the Portugese/Spanish players (why else would Bosingwa play so much more than Ivanovic?) and Lampard is clearly much better than Meireles, despite his age. His treatment of Anelka, Alex and the reserves (not allowing to be around the first team) was also very alienating and downright wrong. To this day, I'm upset at how we treated Anelka and Alex. They were good people, fantastic servants to the club and AVB threw them onto the scrapheap as though they were nothing. They deserved a lot better. In particular, we missed Anelka a lot this year. Wish he was with us in Munich.

Clearly a lot of mistakes were made during AVB's reign, by himself and the players at the club. Having read a lot of the stories that have surfaced, I'm more inclined to think it was a result of AVB's inexperience with adversity, tactical stubbornness (defensive highline was employed for much too long), poor communication, and in a more general sense, poor man-management. I feel for the guy, I wanted to see him succeed for a long-time and took his firing hard, but I think the English media twisted the story to make AVB seem a victim and (wrongly) made Lampard/Chelsea seem evil. 

I think AVB (and Chelsea) rushed into this too early. He wasn't ready for a club like Chelsea, in the state we were in at the beginning of the year. I do think he had Roman's backing though, but once he clearly lost the dressing room (more of a manager's fault than anyone else), Roman had no other choice. At that point, we were in line to lose the CL, FA Cup, and likely with a bottom ten finish in the EPL. Roman did what he had to do.

[ScreamingGerman's](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/tynil/in_defense_of_avb/c4qv561) reply is an excellent counter-argument, btw, and I recommend anyone who reads the OP should read that too.

At Chelsea, he had money, but perhaps not enough time, with too much interference in transfers, and IMO was too rigid with his targets - ideally, he brings half his Porto squad with him, but were there Plan B signings? 

At Liverpool, I'm guessing the setup will be more cooperative in transfers than at Chelsea, but he definitely won't have enough money, and maybe not enough time, to shape the squad. So I'm worried.

If he doesn't end up shaping the squad sufficiently to his methods, his time at Anfield will fail like his time at Chelsea. He doesn't change his tactic significantly when he isn't getting results. His man management of players that aren't in his immediate plans is awful, making me worry about a dressing-room fallout with the likes of Gerrard (if he tries to rotate him too much) and Carragher (blah blah high line blah) - he's still a key figure in the dressing room. In general, the last thing Liverpool needs is a divided and unhappy dressing room again.

&gt; Many thanks for your letter dated 27th April.


&gt; We would welcome the opportunity to engage with you in a public debate over the forth-coming weeks, so that both sides of the debate have an equal chance to hear and understand each others’ perspectives. To this end we invite you to join us on neutral ground, with a neutral chairperson, for an open exchange of opinions and concerns.


&gt; We are pleased that you are calling for rigorous evidence-backed discussion and are therefore somewhat bemused to note your insistence that aphid-resistant GM wheat will decrease pesticide use. This often repeated biotech industry claim has been widely discredited. (1) On the contrary, findings in the US, Canada and India, show that weeds and predators rapidly develop immunity to GM strategies, resulting in the use of ever increasing amounts of herbicides and pesticides. (2) The concern that the GM Cadenza wheat you are trialling could lead to an increase, rather than a reduction in pesticides, was raised by a geneticist from EcoNexus in her submission to DEFRA, as well as by GM Freeze.


&gt; In your letter you make no mention of the serious issue of the antibiotic resistant marker gene. You assert that “all plants in all types of agriculture are genetically modified to serve humanity’s needs”, suggesting that selective breeding is a similar science to genetic modification, which is both false and misleading. You are openly releasing a synthetic version of a compound that can not be regarded as “substantially equivalent”, and has had no long-term health safety tests whatsoever for human consumption, or for its impacts on non-target species. This practice does not therefore adhere to the EU’s precautionary principle.

The native americans learned what they could eat by watching bears at one time.  Anything a bear could eat, they found they could eat.  Do the scientists at Monsanto eat their own GMO food?  The answer is NO, it is banned from their restaurants.  They won't touch it.  

Safety is a provable concept this is how we know some chemicals kill us and other chemicals slowly kill us and some promote health.  One of the biggest things people seem to forget about food is that a plant only needs three nutrients to grow and reproduce; Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium.  Humans however could not survive on just these three nutrients.  GMO's constantly talk about increased yields and even if that were true, that means that you have more plants competing for the nutrients from the same amount of land.  What would be the consequences of that?  

We don't need more food!!!!  People understand this, we need more nutrient dense food.  Our land is being stripped of it's nutrients, this is why we have to use fertilizers.  The reason plants are being attacked by disease and pests is because they are not healthy!!!!!  Why do we get sick?  Why do we get cancer?  why do we die?  

GMO is the biggest scam and diverting people's attention from the real issue.  We are  being starved by the foods we eat.  You show me how producing more from the same acre will increase the amount of nutrients in that food.  Where do all these nutrients we need come from?  The soil, water, sun.  Once you've stripped the soil, you have to add them back some how.  commercial fertilizer is only designed to grow the plant so it can reproduce, not to sustain good health in human beings.

The reason you are trying to tell me that safety is unprovable is because it is impossible to show that GMO's are safe and I don't care how many people in white lab coats try to tell me that they are safe, I don't trust them one bit, because they are not being truthful about the food they are designing.",0,1337665642,null,0,false,0,c4qvgd2,t3_txjr3,t1_c4qvgd2,t1_c4qpl8o,null,1428974470,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I feel the debate has been deliberately framed to paint taketheflourback as anti-scientific luddites. The particular modification is all about 'proving' that a variety can produce a compound to confuse pests. That doesn't seem to need a field trial, but let us consider the implications of one. ~~Ignoring [horizontal gene transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) which could easily leave the 'novel' genetic material in the immediate ecosystem despite pollination,~~ this trial helps set a precedence for GM products being grown en masse. This therefore seems more like a test of public opinion, politics, but most importantly commercial viability than of the furthering of knowledge. We can even read the following answer from their FAQs: [""By their very nature all new discoveries are commercially viable. As scientists though, our interest is about using scientific process to generate evidence to show if a technology works""](http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/Content.php?Section=AphidWheat&amp;Page=QA).

Elsewhere on the site we find a description of the controversial wheat crop:

&gt; [Our innovative approach to crop protection is based on an understanding of insect chemical ecology. **Use of insect repellents and attractants delivered by crops has been used successfully in a push-pull companion cropping system in E. Africa which is a non-GM system.** Our new GM project will test if it is possible to deliver semiochemicals from crops themselves instead of having to grow additional companion crops.](http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/Content.php?Section=AphidWheat)

The above description matches the pattern of [bioprospecting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioprospecting), which is often the taking of indigenous farming practices and adding a novel element to enable patents. We see this elsewhere with the Bt gene modification (which is failing). We have Rothemstad with a very slick and savvy campaign against the thugs not keen on open debate, but like previously stated they appeared on national TV in debate. It certainly has managed to whip-up quite the witch-hunt.

If you want the public to trust the research done by gmo scientists tackle problems that are in the public's interest.  How to get nutritional safe food to the table and protect the biodiversity of our environment at the same time.  Who is going to trust anyone who patents food?  Who is going to trust anyone who will put their research ahead of the concerns of the public?  

If you think this is a complicated matter that needs to be understood by all, why don't you educate the people on the issue?  Scientists seem to think that just because people are against gmo that we are ignorant but this isn't true at all.  We are concerned about our food because we have no choice but to eat what is provided for us in this day of age.  We have traded our food freedom because of lack of personal land, and time to cultivate our own food.  We have learned that we can aspire to greater things then merely surviving by trading our skills and knowledge for the things we need to survive.  

But now things have changed, food has become a commodity that investors play with affecting not only the quality of that food, but who gets it, who doesn't, and how much we will pay for it.  Not only that, it is now being patented and the bigger these GMO companies get they are buying up our traditional seed producers as well.

My uncle went and managed to persuade her to have the operation on her hip/thigh (didn't need it replaced, just pins or something to hold the bone in place). From what I've heard she wasn't that happy when coming around, and has been refusing food, drink, whilst saying she wishes she was dead (which you can completely understand).

Even though there's this illness, it is hard to believe that it is her doing it. She lived an amazing life, born on a farm and would deliver milk, became a teacher for a few years, got married to a vicar whose family had a long history of being in good wealth. Since his death in 1969, she could easily afford to buy a nice property when they had to move out of the vicarage, then into a smaller house later on (sadly a lot of old furniture from the 1600s-1900 had to be sold). At the height of economy before the recession around 2008, she had a total wealth of about £1,000,000 including shares, savings, and the house.

Now look at her, been stuck in her house for about a decade seldom going out because of her legs. Getting dementia which has recently become worse, having to go into a residential care home. Recently having several falls and broken her femur, just like she did to her arm about 10 years ago.

It is truly horrible to see her like this, it's probably wrong of me to say this but I would rather her be dead than be alive now. Seeing her in pain all the time, hardly remembering events, not having any quality of life and she says she doesn't either, not remembering who anyone is (she thought my dad, her son who cared for her was just that, a carer). She's probably full of fear and scared, she would hear voices and from what we've read in advice you have to just agree with them. It is truly hard witnessing someone you love and know change because of this disease.

It really varies, there are a lot of stereotypes (drunken football fans, red faced men with fat bellies etc) but it's the same in most european countries; *most* drinkers are well behaved, but you only hear about the bad ones because they attract the most attention.

&gt;Is there a difference between the generations?

Not really, I would say that younger people are more liklely to take their drunkeness too far due to lack of experience. But there are plenty of people aged 40-50 and above who will pick fights and yell in the street. It's all relative.

As for the aphids, I imagine they have sets of figures explaining how much their particular wheat is averagely effected by aphids, the GM crop they are growing  should (if it works well) show a statistically significant drop in aphid activity.  

This is not actually my area of research, but I would guess that this trial is also part of a proof of concept.  If they can alter one type of wheat (to successfully deter aphids) then  another type of wheat (say perhaps one that is commonly grown in the UK) would be easier (because of the knowledge gained from the first).

Exactly. For example I would like to ask the submitter a follow on question.  

*""The wheat they are testing is safe. It can only self-pollinate so it contains no potential to pollinate any nearby crops.""*

While the wheat may or may not be safe, we can't guarantee the experiment itself is safe. 

[Assessing effects of transgenic crops on soil microbial communities. Widmer F 2007](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522827)
Concludes it's review of 60 studies with a great big fat ""we don't know yet"".  

We know cross pollination happens between ""natural/wild"" crops and ""GM"" crops, and that is a cause for concern. [A Bt Transgene Reduces Herbivory and Enhances Fecundity in Wild Sunflowers 2003](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3099898?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=56163527663)

So now we test with crops that can't cross pollinate, but we still don't know what is happening to the soil. 

Which leads us back to catch 22 - we need to test to find out, but we don't know it's safe enough for a field test. 

My personal view is GM has huge potential, but we need to take baby steps, which includes highly controlled testing. What concerns me is it feels GM is being raced into wider use than we're ready for, when the claims that it is ""safe"" are still no where near satisfied. 

Making such safety claims is unhelpful if we are to have intelligent debate and if the ""pro gmers"" really want to win public support. ",0,1337676611,null,0,false,0,c4qwr7p,t3_txjr3,t1_c4qwr7p,t1_c4qq161,null,1428975077,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

No. No no no. It is *our* fault for letting kids have the phones. Mobile providers are businesses, businesses are there to make money and only money. It is our collective failure as citizens and parents, not theirs, that we have a culture where phone ownership and use by children is the accepted standard. 

If we had pressed earlier for more control, then there would have been an economic incentive to develop tools like Vodafone's. But we didn't. And now Vodafone have taken a punt and will wait to see whether it's commercially successful or not (which is right and proper market economics).

What do you consider to be the core essential needs of a living being?

Food, water, shelter are all guaranteed in the UK, the basic need to reproduce is fundamental to life, so perhaps it should be a right.

I don't see why IVF should be treated differently to cancer or heart disease. We don't have a right to be disease free after all and yet we are treated for free even having smoked 50 a day while eating 8 fried breakfasts a week.

Or, perhaps a better example -  we provide IVF to avoid the mental health issues from denying a biological urge, if we stop providing free IVF, then shouldn't similar treatments also be removed?

  Reconstructive surgery for burn and accident victims for example, they can be given a balaclava and told to get on with their lives.  That kind of plastic surgery is offered for free because we know without basic ""normal"" looks, people can become withdrawn and isolated.

The change basically recognises that classic cars, whose owners tend to maintain them obsessively and not drive them very often, don't need that annual test to encourage their owners to maintain them to a high standard.

It's similar reasoning to the idea that a brand new car doesn't need to pass an MoT test for 3 years after sale - it's simply improbable that the car will become unroadworthy in that time.

&gt;Ignoring [2] horizontal gene transfer which could easily leave the 'novel' genetic material in the immediate ecosystem despite pollination

HGT is quite rare. Here is an exert from a paper: Richards et al. Phylogenomic analysis demonstrates a pattern of rare and ancient horizontal gene transfer between plants and fungi. Plant Cell. 2009 Jul;21(7):1897-911

&gt;Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of these 14 data sets, using methods that account for site rate heterogeneity, demonstrated support for **nine HGT events,** demonstrating an **infrequent pattern of HGT** between plants and fungi. Five HGTs were fungi-to-plant transfers and **four were plant-to-fungi HGTs**.

I mention this article as I am an author on the paper but mainly as it is free for you to go an read, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19584142). I have emboldened the bits I think are quite important wrt this topic. I'm not sure exactly what you think might occur from these trials wrt to HGT. Given they are exceedingly rare over evolutionary time - vast - it is seriously unlikely that it might happen during these trials.

Why didn't I? Well, at the time it was a lot of effort, that could take years, when all you want is a child every day you don't, or cant have one is very painful. I felt awful for my wife who's need was much greater than mine, everything in you life goes into limbo, it becomes all consuming. 

Also, when you don't have a child, adopting as a first option is not always the best idea. If you want a first born it take years and years, and if you don't, or are happy to adopt a 3-4 year old (which is more likely) then as a first child there can be a lot of baggage that a first time parent is not exactly prepared for. 

We have a little baby now, took us 8 years, cute little guy he is too. I hope we will be able to adopt him a brother or sister at some point.

Where does the science end and commerce or marketing begin? The BBC article certainly seemed like one of its usual press releases.

&gt; Luddites

Maybe they are, put it is unfair to taint all those opposed to this particular endeavour in a reddit witch-hunt. Science looks at the big picture, and I feel in this case it is being crowded by commerce. There are a few quotes around this trial taken from the Rothamsted site that stood out:

* Unfortunately, repeated use of insecticides often leads to resistant aphids and kills other non-target insect species including the natural enemies of aphids, which could have a further impact on biodiversity.

How does that square with moving production of the active agent into the plant permanently? Does the farmer have to return in a few generations time to ask for the new tweaked variety? Won't pests become immune like what is happening with the Bt related varieties? We know the solution to these practices and it is diversified farming practices with good soil management.

* It forms part of a wider scientific strategy for Rothamsted Research to meet the challenge of increasing food and energy production in a more environmentally sustainable way

Again, I think the scientific community has agreed that production is not the problem it is one of politics. Now perhaps to the most damning quote which makes me think this 'trial' is bullshit:

* Our new GM project will test if it is possible to deliver semiochemicals from crops themselves instead of having to grow additional companion crops.

You don't need a field trial for that so something is being hidden.

&gt; HGT

Fair enough, it might not matter. But permanent contamination is a possibility especially if you have 'unauthorised' people trampling through the area.

&gt; You seem to misunderstand - deliberately? - the difference between applying pesticides and getting the plants to make their own.

In this case I should have said repellent, but supposedly it would make for an attempted genocide, perhaps I should have said apartheid. The difference is only in delivery method really as the net amount of toxins whether 'natural' or artificial remains the same presumably.

Seen as I have got hold of a 'scientist' (:P) what do you think of the idea that agriculture historically has never been sustainable and never will?

I personally don't agree with that statement, but if we are talking about cost/health/helpfulness then I would argue thats a valid reply.

The issue with IVF, and this is where your argument is flawed Is a cost issue. A child will produce more in tax and give more back to society in the years it is alive than the cost of IVF treatment, its in fact a good business move if nothing else. If anything it generates money for the NHS to pay for £9k bypass surgeries.

The same cannot be said for other treatments that extend life for 10/20 years or less.

How do I feel about the cost/it going else where.... Its a tricky question but Im essentially happy about it. The NHS will pay for 3 treatments, and I firmly believe 3 treatments are enough.

true,istara,australia,Australia,"I agree with you.  I have a friend who suffered two ectopic pregnancies one after the other, and lost both tubes.  She now has a healthy infant boy and is a wonderful parent.

As you say, adoption is not in any way the same or even a possible option for many couples.  And I would even say that parenting an older adoptive child is more appropriate for those already with parenting experience:  existing parents, or foster parents.  It's hard enough starting with a ""blank slate baby"" as a new parent, without taking on a child with intense emotional and behavioural issues as a result of neglect and abuse.

The other point that should be made is that women having babies in their late thirties/forties is not new.  It's **women having a first baby at a later age** that is unusual.

Fostering is also problematic because you often get quite fucked up kids and then you have to suffer seeing them often put back with their fucked up families.

There are no institutional barriers to stop a clever but poor person getting a bursary at a private school or university and getting a top education - so the question is why don't they?

How much of it is down to parenting skills - or more accurately, a lack of parenting skills?

How much of it is due to school teachers actively discouraging clever pupils from being ""different"" from the rest or, horrors, wanting to be successful?

I think we could do a lot more to improve social mobility not necessarily from the bottom to the the top, but from the bottom to the middle by improving secondary education and throwing resources at the 8-16 year olds.

when you go to the clinic for the first time, the need a sample from the man (yeah, the least fun wank Iv ever had!) and I believe they scanned my wife for problems, or took a sample (cant remember which now) .

They found that we both me and my wife had problems. Either of these problems by themselves would not be too much of a problem, but combined it was. At that point I someone in NHS land decided we would be a good candidate for treatment and we went from there. We where told there would be a 30% chance of the IVF treatment being successful, and under the NHS we could have three attempts, after which point we could continue indefinitely but we would have to pay.

From what I can understand its not that common to conceive naturally, typically people on IVF have tried and tried for years (we tried for about 6-7 years). But that does not mean its impossible :)

But this strikes me as knee-jerk. 

&gt; ""no one is coming out of this with much credit, particularly the football club's image and brand.""

Part of their unhappiness seems to stem from the fact that managers are apparently 'rejecting Liverpool' as a result of us using an interview process, which isn't necessarily true, and even if it is should not necessarily be a source of shame. Also, how does a public challenge like this help the football club's image and brand, and tell prospective candidates about the fans' expectations? We come off as nosier than a Roman oligarch.

&gt; ""Instead, we have silence and a lack of information or understanding on decisions being made.""

The owners have been clear enough about the structure they will be putting in place - 2 people to fill Comolli's role, to be appointed in the very near future, and deciding on a manager from a shortlist who will be interviewed. That much can be gleaned from information on the official LFC website, without needing to be constantly up-to-date on gossip. Beyond that, do we really need to know yet? Information on how the process is progressing might mislead candidates.

&gt; ""As supporters we have seen all too clearly what a lack of communication from absentee owners leads to""

Unfair and unnecessary comparison. If they wanted to pull this card, the only thing that would be worth using it on is FSG not telling us about progress on the stadium - again, you could say, why tell us until there's definitive information on how it's progressing; but in that case, an update would not go astray.

&gt; ""We ask that you speak with supporters - engage with a true representative cross section of supporters and work with supporters to provide solutions to our current problems.""

The sad truth is, *we don't own the club.* FSG can do whatever they want, much in the same way H&amp;G did, because they own it. I wouldn't be averse to Liverpool developing a partial supporter-ownership, if done right, but it doesn't exist right now. Anyway, how do they want the supporters to help provide solutions *on this current issue*? Pick your own manager? 

You can't have it both ways - nobody asked for fans to be involved when Hodgson was sacked, Kenny was appointed first short-term then long-term, or when new commercial deals were being struck; by and large the fans were happy with all of these. Suddenly, the first time FSG are taking a decision that might be slightly controversial in the supporters' eyes, fans are saying ""involve us"".

true,anudeglory,eng-devon,Devon,"&gt;New Scientist reported on this in july of 2002.

Since you haven't bothered with a link, I went and found it [here](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2565-gm-crop-dna-found-in-human-gut-bugs.html) and since New Scientist, back then, did not link to primary literature I went and found that too, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12067423) and you can read the PDF of it [here](http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=898064) and you should follow it up with the Invited Commentary, [here](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=898036).

The NS article, at first, would agree with you if you ignored all the following passages and primary scientific literature.
&gt;For the first time, it has been proved that bacteria in the human gut can take up DNA from genetically modified food.

For example;
&gt;When he examined stools from the healthy volunteers, he found no traces whatever of DNA from the GM food. It had all been digested. Nor did he find any evidence that gut bacteria had taken up the DNA.

and

&gt;These data indicate that some transgenes in GM foods may survive passage through the small intestine.

But lets not take NS' hyperbolic word for it, let us look at the primary literature!

&gt;The results from these in vitro simulations of intestinal
digestion suggest that some transgene DNA may survive
in the human stomach and small bowel for up to 4 h and
provide insights into some dietary factors that affect the
Intestinal degradation of transgenes 541digestion of DNA in the gastrointestinal tract. It should be
noted that the QC-PCR assay used in the present study
employed relatively short target sequences and leaves
open the possibility that, while transgene DNA survived
for a considerable period under these simulated gut conditions, the DNA may be in such small fragments as to
be of limited biological signiﬁcance and thus may represent no apparent health risk.

And whilst we're on the subject, and remember 2002 was ten years ago. Lets look at a more recent example, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20193062).
&gt;Although we were unable to detect any transformation events in our experiment, it cannot be ruled out that this could happen in the GI tract. However, since several steps are required before expression of plant-derived DNA in intestinal bacteria, we believe this is unlikely, and antibiotic resistance development in this environment is more in danger by the massive use of antibiotics than the consumption of GM food harbouring antibiotic resistance genes.

Then you say;
&gt;The other issue with this is that genetic engineering is not exact. You just bombard the cell with dna and some times some dna is dormant in the plant because it was not activated or digested by the cell.

Why don't you read the method from the aforementioned study and notice how exact the method really is. Figure 1. It's nothing like what you are describing.

&gt;This also means that the plant is also part virus.

Showing yet more ignorance. It is a well known fact that most genomes of plants and animals share derivatives of virus and other species. Check [this](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100107103621.htm) article out - ""Eight Percent of Human Genetic Material Comes from a Virus"".

&gt;The very process of gmo is to cross species barriers and to invade genes, which makes them more likely to transfer horizontally.

No, moving them is an artificial form of the process called horizontal gene transfer that can occur naturally. It has no say on whether or not the gene in question is more likely to then undergo further or rampant HGT events.

1. They're extremely limited in number - hence competition for them is high. If this indicates anything, it's that they're not meeting demand.

2. Many children (and their parents) may not even be aware that such bursaries exist. Even if they were, this would only exacerbate point 1.

3. You shouldn't need a bursary to attend a top school. Admission to the country's best institutions should be decided on merit, not the size of daddy's wallet.

She's paying about £23,000/year, and with the teacher's pension, scottish widows pension, some money from the CofE for her husband having died, it probably only totals about £10k/year so she's slowing losing her money. I didn't mention it the result, but from the economic crash and all that, her total estate is probably only about £200,000 now due to share prices tumbling down. 

Every single day I would rather her dead, not that I would selfishly want her to, but because I just think she wants her time to end, be with her husband, and also not to put a strain on the remaining family. She's the only elderly relative I've really had (mum's family from Australia, see them about, every 5 years? Didn't really have them in my childhood at all), and my grandfather having died in 1969 I've always felt empty.

She longs to be back in her home, but she needs 24/7 care now it's that bad. She had a fall in the night the other day, if this was at her house and she couldn't get to the phone or alarm, she would've been stuck on the floor for hours until the carer in the morning came. That sort of happened once, she was lying on the floor for about an hour but eventually managed to crawl from the dining room to the phone and call us.

I'm going to keep going on about it so I think I should stop myself. It probably sounds silly but with all this going on it's just in my head all the time and I can't concentrate fully on my final A level exams coming up. The past 5 years of seeing her this way has been horrible, and now that it's getting worse it's unbearable, and upsetting to think of how it's becoming and that eventually her death will occur. It feels wrong saying I want her to die, but I truly do. At least then she'll be free of pain and with her husband, whilst we'll be grieving the strain of her illness won't be upon my family anymore to the extent that the phone would ring up at about 4am, asking my dad to come round (he cared for her every week for the past 6 years, until earlier this year....they only give them £2k a year in carers allowance, taxed too...)

It's pathetic the government, giving anyone who's a registered carer only £2k/year which is taxed too, even if they only help 40 hours a week or 100 hours a week...worked out that what my dad was doing equated about £1.50/hour...that's the state it's on.

The second was where Robben put one past his legs and sprinted ahead and tried to put a cheeky one past Cech near-post. Only a fair bit of luck a major reflexes from Cech deflected the ball to the woodwork. Bos should have probably stayed with Robben but for some reason he switched to marking another BM player (Kroos?) just as Robben started his dribbling run. This offer BM player was, thus, double-marked and Robben was left free to run into the box.

Also, I figured it would be best to reference the SOS statements directly, so [here](http://www.spiritofshankly.com/news/fsg-we-need-direction) is the initial one following Dalglish's sacking. [Here](http://www.spiritofshankly.com/news/letter-to-fsg-recent-events) is their most recent one following dialogue with the club.

There's some stuff in there omitted by the media (surprise, surprise) which I agree with them on:

- The lack of a Chief Executive in Merseyside before now is baffling - I'm not sure whether Comolli was effectively doing some of the job, or Ayre, or there just wasn't one. But I don't think they will appoint a conventional CEO-type; the appointment of a GM should provide the 'footballing man' who takes care of the financial aspects related to the playing squad, and I think the off-the-pitch financial stuff will be taken care of by Ayre and the other person they're bringing in to help with that. 

- As I said above, some news on the stadium issue would be nice.

- Ayre's contradictory statements about trophies vs revenue is a good catch (I honestly do want someone else to start doing the interviews on behalf of the club), but I think SOS are a bit simplistic in their response. Liverpool are now at a stage where we need to maximise our income in order to best provide a sustained challenge for trophies.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"The difference is engineering is intentional, the right wing don't tend to care about the wider social implications of their actions as long as if it benefits them and/or fits their mould of how everyone else *should* act. Their policies tend towards removing the things that they think make people the way they are (welfare, a support net) and casting them off into some sort of game where they achieve because the only thing holding them back was a lack of intensive to try. This is kind of like an evolutionary approach to finding the optimal or ideal society. The problem with evolution is it takes a long time and it is really expensive; you get duplication, repetition, failed branches, successful approaches being ruled out because of anomalous environmental conditions etc etc.

In reality its about getting the balance right between individual freedom and bringing people from poorer backgrounds more in line with those from richer backgrounds. A liberal looks for a pareto optimal way of doing this (i.e. rich people don't loose but poor people don't gain) but a socialist doesn't care about pareto optimality because the rich have such a high score in the first place (80% of the wealth owned by 20% of society etc etc). The rich (and wanna-be rich) strike back against this because they view anyone even remotely attempting to limit their earnings in any way as an evil totalitarian communist. The middle ground of the left say ""ok we can't make the world perfect, we admit that. People are still responsible for their own actions; we get that. But is it at all possible that you buy 3 cars instead of 7 this year? Is that extra house in Monaco *really* necessary"".

This approach almost inevitably gets thrown back against the wall with responses of ""This will encourage people not to be 'wealth creators' or 'it stifles innovation'""; for me this battle is pathetic filled with self entitlement ""The world is for me to make what I want"". The fact of the matter is that wealth inequality encourages wage *slavery* (which is real, not imaginary slavery like the ""TAXES = SLAVERY"" argument). This is further compounded by showing that wealth inequality is demonstrably a causal factor with regards to crime rates, suicide rates and obesity (to mention a few). No-one wants to stop innovation, no-one thinks individuals aren't responsible for their own actions, no-one wants to stop you owning a business; Taxes and Welfare are just a really good way of making society a fairer, safer place.

If you don't give a poor single mother a home because its too expensive you pay for the prison sentence the kid gets 18 years from now.

The ultimate problem is that people are greedy, selfish and suspicious. For this reason they ellect a government that they most relate to; a greedy, selfish and suspicious one. Get enough of these people in a room together and the emergent behaviour is probably going to be a corrupt strategy that benefits them.

true,thebuggalo,null,null,"I never once got the impression that Amy was broken at all. They alluded to the fact that she had seen psychiatrists, but based on what we actually see, I would say she is just a normal person.

And when we actually get to see some of her childhood and growing up (in Let's Kill Hitler) she doesn't seem to be affected.  Sure she has some TARDIS and Doctor drawings in her room, but it's not like she is treated like she is broken or acts broken. If anything, she is the sane and normal one that has to help out Mels all the time. Mels seemed more broken than Amy.

What we get is not character development from Amy, but just being told what she is supposed to be.  She is constantly referred to as ""The Girl Who Waited"", but even that seems overly dramatic when you think about it.  It's not like she literally waited for him.  If anything, she moved on and grew up, like a normal person. Sure she got some slack for having (what everyone else believed to be) an imaginary friend, but other than a few Doctor toys she had laying around her room, it doesn't seem like she was too negatively affected.

When I first saw The Eleventh Hour, I was excited by the idea of the Doctor meeting Amy for the first time when she was a child. I thought it would create a much different relationship between her and the Doctor (where she viewed him more as a friend, and less as a love interest). Looking back now, I would have loved to see a relationship much like the Doctor had with the young Kazran in A Christmas Carol. But unfortunately that didn't happen and we are left with the same tired companion story all over again.

I just feel that with Amy, most of her ""character development"" is told to us, instead of seen.  If the episode calls for the viewer to be sad for her, she is referred to as ""The Girl Who Waited"", to make us feel bad for her.... if we are supposed to view her as a strong female, she bosses around Rory a bit so we know that is the attitude she is going to have this episode. It just feels like lazy writing and a completely under developed character.  After 2 seasons you would think I'd feel something for her, but I don't.

I shudder to think what the quality must be like in more deprived areas of London.

On the other hand, it shows a real lack of imagination; he basically just wanted to carry his Porto team with him. Porto had just lost their manager and key striker; they weren't going to sell the rest of their squad to boot. Yes, managers sometimes bring in players from their old clubs, but really, 3 out of 5 (with Meireles also a former Porto player)? And once he didn't get them, was there a plan B, to try and sign someone not from Porto who would fit in?

&gt;He had his tactics, formations, squad rotations and staff appointments all planned out before he set foot in England.

Honestly, that just strikes me as naive - surely you need to actually see the squad you've inherited play and train in front of you? AVB really seems to be the sort of manager where if you're in his plans, you're golden, and if you're not, you're invisible and useless. 

At least with Kenny, if players like Kuyt or Maxi were unhappy with the lack of first-team time, they were professional about it, the squad stuck together, and so on - part of that has to be down to Kenny's man management. (Don't go spewing on about Chelsea's egos, virtually everyone except the Portuguese players and Sturridge was unhappy with AVB by the end of it, not just the 'old guard').

Still, he's not afraid of sticking his head in. He's good in the air, and he definitely has that aura of authority. 

The only thing I worry about with him is getting caught out on one of his runs forward and leaving us exposed. Hopefully he's smart enough to realize the opportunities to do it in the Premiership are going to be less than in the Dutch league. 

He was criticized early in the year for being complacent and perhaps a little lazy, but during a push for the title the dude got his shit together and really drove that team, if you believe some Ajax fans. A criticism in the past is that he was only able to push himself to the top level for the biggest games. To me that simply shows he needs a new challenge; I think he'll come to us hungry.

It looks promising that a lot of journals are opening up to the idea although there is still large resistance from some of the larger publishers, so from time to time you will be unable to get access without being a member of the Journal or a University with a subscription. I have this problem, as do many at other institutions, as well as the public. However, if you are really interested in one, writing to the corresponding author should result in you being able to acquire a pre-publication unformatted version of the article :)",0,1337701494,null,0,false,0,c4qzvc9,t3_txjr3,t1_c4qzvc9,t1_c4qyq9s,null,1428976544,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Constructive feedback for the subreddit:

I personally haven't been as active as I could have been in promoting this subreddit. Does anyone think it would be worth having any promotional-type things in town? Posters with inside jokes for redditors, information for non-redditors?

I think it might be good to get some societies on board and use this page as a means to get some lesser known societies out there.

I am on the committee of the Gaming society, so next year I will post about any events we have going on that I think might appeal to the crowd here. We have LAN parties, BarCrafts™, gaming-themed bops, console meetups, gaming tournaments all in the works for next year.

However Henry and FSG are different than Roman, they want to build a team that will last and be in the champions league constantly, that being the case AVB his the perfect fit for them.

Shouldn't the same test, abortive procedure and attitude to ""selfishness"" apply to those mothers who have a downs baby without resorting to IVF?

&gt;you're really refusing to acknowledge how late you've left it

You're assuming that all women over 40 have ""left it"".  
That's a dangerous assumption.  
It implies that all women *should* have a partner by 35 (Current IVF acceptance time) and have been trying for a child prior to that age.  
It also implies that they've willfully ommitted to have children.  
It does not take into consideration numerous miscarriages, reproductive problems that are easily rectified or lack of a suitable partner to share a family with.

Many women will keep being encouraged by doctors to have children while suffering miscarriage after miscarriage, without getting real help to find the root cause until it is too late.  

In our circumstances it is simply incompetence of doctors, or their unfamiliarity of procedures to send my wife for testing and IVF treatment before she reached 40. Couple that with delays in booking appointments and the mandated ""cool-down"" between IVF sessions meant that she only got 2 out of our allotted 3 sessions before the NHS simply cut us off.

Using your viewpoint, the past 6 years of us struggling to have a child should be written off as us having ""left it too late"" and that we've been selfish while suffering about 5 miscarriages *prior* to any testing.

I'm normally the first to criticise the way Levy handles transfers, but this is a little harsh.

We couldn't let Bassong go last August without bringing in a replacement, so the deal we were working on with QPR was based on us getting our main target, Cahill, for a reasonable fee. When it became apparent Bolton weren't lowering their asking price, we were forced to pull out of the Bassong deal unless they were willing to up their offer by enough to cover the extra we'd have to spend to get Cahill, because it was last minute (transfer deadline day) and we had no alternative replacement lined up.

Also:

&gt;Redknapp himself has personal experience of the Levy Hardball. In 2010, after he had led Tottenham to a fourth-placed finish, which was something to celebrate, the Dubai club Al Ahli made a big-money move for him. Levy's compensation demands, though, were even more eye-watering. It was no-go. Redknapp had been interested and the opportunity to work in the gulf continues to carry some appeal.

Is this true? I've never heard mention of it before, and I can't believe Redknapp would have considered giving up his first shot at the CL for a pay check in Dubai.

I wouldn't be surprised to see him there in a year's time to be honest - can definitely see him cashing in until the England job comes up again. Hell of a commute from Sandbanks though.",0,1337706923,null,0,1337707319,0,c4r11in,t3_tybbs,t1_c4r11in,t3_tybbs,null,1428977099,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

You said you don't work in a British school. Over 90% of UK teachers belong to a union. What I was saying is that any attempt to supplement teachers with less qualified assistants will be seen as eroding teachers responsibilities (and thus devaluing them towards removing them) by the teachers unions, which is the same response you had.

&gt; Conservatives (and those who know fuck all about how education works at a grass roots level) use unions on their sleeves as much, or possibly more than those you tout as labourites.

Simply not true. Look at how The Labour Party is funded, almost completely through ""optional"" contributions by union members (included by default in union membership dues, not itemised or made easy to opt-out of). The Labour Party _is part of the trades union movement_. No wonder there are so many strikes and complaints by various unions when Labour aren't in charge, it's part of their election campaign!

As for ""grass roots"", I've heard the ""you can't judge the quality of the food unless you're a chef"" argument from my teacher friends plenty of times, it seems to be the basis to their resistance to change, etc. While the points made by the linked article are _very_ valid, teachers aren't really going out of their way to improve things.

Threaten to slightly reduce teachers excellent pension plans? National strikes. Impose ridiculous box-ticking based, ""don't damage the little snowflakes"" type ""teaching"" practices? Hardly a peep. It's quite clear where their priorities lie.

What i don't enjoy is the number of 'plastic' fans that have diluted the passion of football clubs. Unfortunately for Chelsea and Man City, they will forever be associated with fans that know nothing of the clubs heritage and turn up because it is the 'fashionable' thing to do. Im not accusing you of being one, but it is more prevalent in these such clubs due to their new-found riches. Your case of the us and Stoke competed might be short-lived. Stoke hardly compete whereas we got 5th taking advantage of Liverpool and Chelsea having pathetic seasons.

Juve is looking for a top quality striker, but Juve being Juve i expect them to splash on a known ""european"" name....Torres, RVP, Dzeko.  They like presenting to their fans players from the continent with names they will recognize.  Damiao i am sure is on their chart but i would figure it behind the front page names.

Real may be laden with striker talent but they have always been of the opinion that its never enough so they are always in the race, Neymar would be their first choice but Damiao would be on their list. 

Liverpool may have spent 70 on strikers, but if Suarez is someone they could sell especially at a profit, they won't hesitate to do so.

Anzhi is more or less Mars for top level players, but they pay so outrageously and give such fringe benefits that it makes it a place that virtually any player will at least listen to. I agree that i don't think he ends up there, more for the fact that i think he wants to go somewhere and be seen, no one sees you play at Anzhi.

PSG and Chelsea will splash the money, and need at striker or not they will always consider top caliber players. PSG could pretty much put him into the rotation right away and is a CL team.  

Chelsea may be sticking with Torres or may not, either way with Drogba leaving they will make a move for another striker.  Roman may not care about cash but Damiao is a savings compared to Falcao (who they are also supposedly looking at).

Regardless, if we are legitimately interested in bringing him in we would have to move quick.  The longer we stew on a move like this the more likely we are to miss it as a big money team looks for depth or to replace a departure.

The ruling (I assume) is pretty clearly rooted in the ECHR. Parliament ratified the Convention back in the 50's, and then passed the Human Rights Act in 1998. It has not repealed or amended it.

So the government must obey the ruling. 

Where does this talk of 'grey issues' come from? There seems to be nothing that is unclear. The Court is not butting in to British politics and arbitrarily declaring the government must give prisoner's the vote - it is simply pointing out that the government has failed to respect a set of rights/liberties enshrined in British law. 

That the court is not in England is irrelevant, the case could equally have been passed to the High Court (I assume it's too major, or that the government previously appealed).

Birmingham is good if you like shopping. There are a LOT of big stores in the centre, a large jewellery area called simply the 'jewellery quarter' where they actually manufacture things. My engagement ring was made there, like from a piece of metal made, and for the wedding they are removing a silver band inlay and replacing it with gold, actually machining out the silver. Also if you travel out of Birmingham on any of the major old roads, there are a whole array of small independent shops.

We only travel to Birmingham every other month or so. It's nice, but it's a big city and has all of the normal problems cities of that size. Like most of the world, staying on the main routes and in the centre means you'll probably be fine as long as you're not waving around cash.

The uni in Coventry brings in lots of people and that's a good thing. Many of our friends came for the uni and stayed. I think the students are regarded well because most residents are students or ex-students! A little way out of the centre there's perhaps a few areas where student sentiment isn't so friendly, but the student housing is all together, so it's not a big issue there.

Coventry is sort of unique in that it doesn't actually extend much beyond the city centre. I live in the last-but-one town before you leave Coventry and we are still within the city's jurisdiction. Technically, it's all Coventry city.

Oh and one final thing that's frustrated me since I've arrived, our telephone area dialing code is 024, NOT 02476. The '76' is part of the local number.
