true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Eccleston says he ""never bathe[s] in the same river twice"", but he has shown an enormous amount of respect for Moffat and has warmed up a bit to the BBC (he's doing a Borrowers mini-series with them right now). He's said he'd do ""anything for the children"" and would likely be more obliged to join in if they told him that they'd donate a significant amount to a charity if he came on.

Tennant's definitely coming back. He loves the role and only left it because he respects it so much. He's pretty much free (other than being a dad, really) so I'm completely positive he'll be returning.

I don't really see any of the older Doctors coming back portraying themselves, but I'd love to see them take part in some form.

I think bringing back Rose is precisely what they'll do. We can complain all we like but Rose was an important companion and this is the 50th Anniversary. It's the culmination and celebration of the entire series. Everyone who's played a major part so far will want to be included for this historic event.

There are several ways to bring back Rose properly. She's matured and changed quite a bit. Apparently working in AltTorchwood, she's become a bit of a badass. If they don't make a big spectacle out of it (and they've shown that the Eleventh Doctor's pretty much over her) they can bring her and 10.5 back no problem.

I work in technology, and I like electronic music, I grew up when everything was new and I was sucked into it, to see the return of 8 bit retro style nonsense, minecraft, this google rubbish and even into electronic music is annoying me.
Computers are supposed to evolve, it was rubbish back then and it is rubbish now.
Move on, dont look back.

Also, the cracks didn't retroactively delete people and things.  They deleted awareness and memory of those people and things.  When the ducks from the duck pond vanished, we didn't get a continuum in which those ducks had never been (in which case the pond would not be called a duck pond) but a continuum in which no one remembered there had been ducks and saw no weirdness in calling something a duck pond when it had no ducks.  When Amy's parents vanished, she didn't vanish (as she would have if her parents had never existed) but instead no one noticed for a moment how odd it was that a girl seemingly had no parents.  

The most critical thing to remember about the cracks is, they were *cracks* in reality.  Reality was broken and made no sense where the cracks were.

We all have a responsibility to this planet, and the rate we are going, we'll be at 10 billion people by the year 2050. Child Benefit had its desired post-war effect, but now it's time to stop it. Having children should be considered a luxury, not yet another thing the Government has to pay for, and it's up to each couple to decide if THEY can afford to support a child.

While obviously you can't just cancel it overnight, I'd do a long-term phase out. Starting immediately, no benefits above 3 kids, after 5 years no benefits above 2 kids, after 10 years no benefits above 1 kid, and finally after 15 years, no Child Benefit whatsoever.

This should allow all the current generation to grow up with some level of support, and also to become educated that when it's their turn to start a family, they are on their own and there will be no Child Benefit for them to lean on (or abuse as is often the case).

Once the ridiculous taxes (theft) in the UK are all said and done, you'll likely be taking home less than you were back in Philadelphia anyways; even after the raise they're giving you.

true,Shahmat,null,null,"I'm actually writing my dissertation on dissident republican groups at the moment, so I can share a bit of what I have learnt if you like?

First off, if you want the name of an expert on Northern Ireland then Professor Jonathan Tonge is your man. Look his articles and books up, really well-done stuff.

As for what I know, basically since the Provisional IRA formed post-Bloody Sunday, they have seen themselves as the 'defenders' of the Catholic/Republican minority. This is due to the fact that certian elements of that minority rejected the legitimacy of the state police. The fact that the police were often colluding with Loyalist paramilitaries wasn't helpful. [Source] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6286695.stm)

This meant that the IRA has a history of dealing out vigilante justice. This was pretty limited to the areas that they had a strong base, though. So if you were living in an area like Bangor or Ballymena then the IRA weren't interested, unless of course you were a member of the security forces! Nowadays the 'Provos' and the overwhelming majority of republicans accept the role of the police (Sinn Fein voted to accept the PSNI in 2007). [Source] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6308175.stm). However, the die-hards in the dissidents still refuse and that is where you see ground like RAAD (mentioned in one of the other posts) taking over the IRA's self-appointed role of defenders of Catholic minorities. 

The other area where dissidents differ from the old Provos is that they are much, much more heavily involved with organised crime. By and large PIRA funding came from the USA and the occasional bank robbery. But the dissidents and the Loyalists can't secure that sort of thing, so they both are involved with the punishment beatings you are talking about. You don't need to be very well-informed to figure out why they drug dealers would break your kneecaps.

So as you can see, particularly if you are a Republican you can have a beating done to you if you get involved with drugs at any level. A vast amount of the narcotics in Northern Ireland are controlled by the paramilitaries, if not directly then in conjuntion with an extortion scam. [Source] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1110651.stm) That is the other reason you might get a beating. If you do business in a large part of Northern Ireland, particularly if you are a small independent retailer you will face an extortion attempt by some paramilitary. Effectively these guys are criminal thugs, and the story isn't overly different from US gangs.",0,1333277524,null,0,false,0,c47984e,t3_rmouv,t1_c47984e,t3_rmouv,null,1428634335,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

When I was at home the people I was friends with were from all over the place and we never had a problem, I just feel like sometimes the politics of it all gets out of hand. 
I can't say I ""sympathise"" with the UK in full though - I recognise the royal family are good for tourism but I don't like them, I don't like mainland politics because it's corrupt on the whole and never really seems to serve the people who it is supposed to. As a law student I see problems with the law and with the way people are educated about what is and what isn't covered by the law both in England and at home.
I feel like its easier to say that I am a UK national because it is what I am, it has nothing to do with what I believe religiously or how I vote at home - it's just a fact of my location and my outlook.

Of course, we can look at history and say ""British players always fail upon big transfers"", but who's to say that all the players Newcastle got would have played just as well under the scrutiny at Anfield? You make one wrong move at Anfield and people like ourselves go batshit crazy. Carroll was fucked from day one at Anfield because people laughed at him when he made a single mistake. ""£35 million for that?"" we said, even though he wasn't fully fit upon arrival. Players like Cissé and Ba and Cabaye don't have that kind of pressure. They put a foot wrong and it's not the end of the world. It's just a different world to play in.

So I wouldn't say that they brought in players that are ""better than most of the players we have in our lineup."" They're better in their current situation, but it's really hard to predict what they'll do when they suit up for Liverpool. That said, I have noticed that foreign players tend to do better with that scrutiny, perhaps because they can't understand what people are shouting at them. We need more mental steel, along the lines of Lucas, Agger, Gerrard, Suarez.

Paraphrasing what teszelate said, it's simple to call yourself a national of your home country, because it's quite true. Northern Irish people happen to be dual nationals by birth, and the only real impact that preferring one has is changing the pattern on the front of your passport. Everything that you believe or say or do - while perhaps informed by what you consider yourself to be - exists independently of what you call yourself.

I did clarify the ""own"" part below:

&gt; Own might not be the right word, but essentially I mean that for the English at least NI is a part of Ireland, and is only a part of the UK due to a technicality. And while there is understanding of just how much of a complex issue it is, for the English the idea of NI wanting to leave the UK really isn't an emotive subject at all. 

So I still maintain that if NI did want to leave the union, the bulk of the English would care far less than they do about Scotland wanting to do the same.

Carroll was playing really well until that stupid dive. If he would've stayed on his feet and put it in it could've been a totally different result.

Shelvey had a pretty good game for us..

Suarez-Bellamy-Carroll started off looking very dangerous but once that first goal went in we changed our style of play and didn't see any more of it. Our attacking down the right was where we looked most likely to score (apart from Carroll's diving chance) but once we were behind we just put our heads down and didn't perform. 

The second half was poor.

Subs were too little too late.

This legislation is already on shaky ground, given that the Tories were very critical of the same proposals in opposition, and like to think of themselves as having liberal principles, the Lib Dems are generally against infringements on civil liberties, Labour are trying to shake off their reputation for authoritarianism, and the House of Lords has become newly empowered as a watchdog against exactly this sort of thing. A well orchestrated campaign can see the bill off, and hopefully a second defeat will bury it for the future.

Edit: I thought we could try and gather together the talking points to draw on:

* Prod at political soft spots above- say that you thought this or that party was dedicated to the protection of civil liberties, and you'd be extremely wary of voting for them if that wasn't the case.

* Say that you are willing to sacrifice security for privacy, and that this balance is one of the basic principles of a democratic society.

* Talk about the technical infeasibility of the plan- the cost to ISPs, the ease of circumventing the proposals with SSL and proxies, with public key encryption, and with Tor.

I'm not advocating dropping Suarez into the central midfield, I just think moving him a little farther from the goal.  The article compares him to other top strikers against similar competition.  Suarez seems to take a little bit longer and a few more chances per goal than others.  For instance the article compares Rooney and RVP in the Prem. to Suarez in Eredivisie and finds that Rooney and RVP take less touches per goal.

These things might indicate that Suarez isn't in the same category as a finisher as the Prem.'s top target men, OR that Suarez likes to move around with the ball a bit more.  I think the most common thing to see Suarez do, this season, is take on defenders and make one or two men miss.  This opens up space and gives teammates a chance to get in on the action.  (check out this seasons Suarez to Gerrard link ups)

I still think Suarez is a top striker, but moving him into a high attacking midfield/striker position might be more beneficial for him.

First of all. Most of the people you seem to be addressing were happy to see Kenny come in because Roy was doing awful and his signings were pretty atrocious. Kenny came in and gave us a solid half a season, was given a huge amount of money and spent it all. What do we get this season?

The worst performances in the league that I can remember (been supporter for 17 years now) and the ~~Little Debbie Mickey Mouse Cup~~ Carling Cup.

**The reason people are calling for Kenny to go is because his signings and his league performance are awful... the same reason... wait for it... we also wanted Roy to go.**

The way modern football works is that in order to attract and keep talent you need to do well in the League. In order to qualify for lucrative champions league competition you need to do well in the league. In order to attract and keep large sponsors you need to do well in the league. We are doing awful in the league. Let me know when you start to connect the dots, OP.

Please name me one thing that is enjoyable about watching us right now. Seriously, give me one.

You are the one who needs some perspective. We will be lucky to finish top half this season, and if you think players like Reina, Suarez and Lucas are going to stick around if that persists, you are insane.

I did not even bother to get up and watch the game today, and for me, this is the first time in a very long time I have not made the effort to watch them play.

I knew they would lose, the last time I watched Liverpool play such dire football was under Graham Souness, and we all know what happened to him...his reputation was destroyed, and his success as a player at the club was forgotten.  I do not want this to happen to Kenny, cups are nice but 8th in the premier league is just not good enough.

I can handle losing to Newcastle, they are playing well, got a good team spirit and bought players that fit in with the clubs current crop of players, they are over-performing, but this is what every club should strive for.  We bought bought players that are young and will grow, but Liverpool cannot wait for potential, and I said this at the start of the season.

I never lose hope that Liverpool will turn things around, and be better then this.  At this point the season is just a write off, we won a cup...we got into europe.  Time to tinker with the tactics, drop those who need to be dropped, play kids if you have to, do something to instill confidence in the team, stop playing people in the hope they have a good game, only to drop them the next.

Henderson needs a spell in the reserves, so does Carroll, Gerrard is just too broken and getting older by the day.  We need another striker to go with Suarez, play Kuyt upfront, instead of on the right where he is slow and fleeting in his greatness.  I would say it is time to get rid of Kenny before his past his forgotten and all we remember is how we went from garbage under Hodgson, to worse under our greatest player of all time.

But I am willing to give him one more summer of rebuilding, if it was not for the cup runs I would say time to go.  BUT, if Rafa Benitez is available and the owners have just a small thought about bringing him back, I would do it.  If there is anyone that can get the best out of the players, despite their stature, it is Rafa.

sorry you couldnt be more wrong. Have been part of a thing that involved sending 1000s of letters from 1000s of people to a selection of MPs, about 10% even bothered to reply and those all said the party line. MPs only care about the party line right now. When its nearer an election then they will just say yes to everything but again not mean a word of it. 

Bare in mind each MP represents about 60,000 people they will get alot of mail, most from the same person complaining about everything, but how many different things does an MP do than annoys someone.

I support Liverpool Football Club, not Suarez Football Club, not Dalglish Football club, not Doni Football Club. **LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB**.

I give players my support when they're on the pitch because they represent my club, I support the managers initial decisions because he represents my club. When a player plays badly or a manger makes the wrong decision I criticise them because it is compromising my football club. Some of you follow Liverpool like it's some sort of holy book where by blind faith will reward you with the Premiership and European Cup in the same season. That's not how it works.

You don't look like a good supporter for mindlessly following a manager who oozed accolade in the last millennium, you look like an idiot. What happens if we get relegated next season? Do I get to come on here and say 'Told you so!' like a child. No, I'll continue to criticise a manager who clearly isn't performing. If we finish 4th next season, sure I'll be happy and sure I'm willing to give Dalglish a chance but need I remind you that we have won 2 games this year in the premiership, and it's April.

&gt;Every time someone a person complains about an entity in plural does that require a source to be included so as to prove the accusation is not malicious?

I think it's an issue of degrees of criticism. Scientists take this to the max - you don't say claim anything you can't either prove or cite as proven. Everything has to be supported. Tabloids go the opposite way, you can say anything, even complete hearsay, and it's taken as gospel without so much as a batted eyelid. The question arises, where do we want to stand on this spectrum as a sub-collective on reddit?

Obviously somewhere in the middle, for the most part. I suppose this is exactly why I downvoted erowidtrance - his or her post was a tabloid level statement. Naturally this is a subjective issue, but I'm not claiming he or she is wrong (or right), just that the quality of the post was very low. This is what votes are for.

&gt;I agree that blanket statements are not helpful, however when vested interests are as blatant as they are in the lobbying industry I feel that blanket downvotes are equally destructive

Which lobbying industry? Lobbying on whose behalf? Who wants increased state surveillance? Just labelling the entire corporate world as responsible is not only incredibly unlikely, but patently naive and lacking any support whatsoever in his post.

&gt;especially without comment which leaves the author no chance to expand/clarify/rebute.

This is the unfortunate nature of reddit, there are lots of people who vote without posting. A lot of great posts get buried as a result, and a lot of shit does too. That said, I think as a general rule of thumb users who wish to be well recieved should consider that when making a contentious statement such as the case in point, one has to put forth a reason or some evidence or argument *with* the post, not afterward when everyone asks for it, because in most cases, people just won't.",0,1333305431,null,0,false,0,c47c9t6,t3_rnph9,t1_c47c9t6,t1_c47bp7r,null,1428635852,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I admired Liverpool for never giving something up, being a great team, playing attractive football. In the moment, there is nothing, really nothing I can identify with. I will still support the Club for sure, but it seems like they want to do everything to make me hate the Club for some reason. 
Really disappointing, giving up after the 27th game because there is no hope for top4, with 10 games to play, poor tactical decisions by Kenny, late subs, frustrating results, overpaid and overpriced players like Henderson, Downing, Adam and Carroll, make me feel very numb supporting the Club. There were just too many days or nights I was in bad mood or pissed when I watched Liverpool. It was just horrible. I have a life, I have responsibilities and I can't be pissed 2 times a week because my favorite Team plays like shit. It is even worse, they play like they want to show me what an idiot I am, that I still support them. 

So I am not raging, what is frightening to me, I normally rage, I normally give all my passion to the Club while we play. But in the last weeks and months, this shit, just became too much. I can't any longer. I just hope change will come with a new manager, and players. That is the only hope I see for the Club.

Were these original letters, or were they signed cards, or standard letters? If it was a genuine campaign of people writing letters themselves I've no idea how you'd have the data to be able to say that only 10% responded. And do you actually expect them to reverse their opinion in a letter to a constituent, to say 'fair cop, I've been rumbled'? What they do is say 'We understand your concerns, and this is party policy...' and then they go away and think about it. The more the letters pile up, the more they think about it.

The difference is these bills have an ideological foundation in the coalition, and a fair amount of support. Particularly the DWP reforms with the Universal Credit, I have never heard anyone speak against them with credibility.

The problem isn't David Cameron or Francis Maud saying the wrong thing.  The situation was like a dry forest that has been kept from burning for an unnatural number of years: something's going to set it off, it's not helpful to blame the sun on a bottle, or the lightening, or the arsonist.

I do blame the government though, it's their job to alter these super-critical situations before they collapse.  In this case, they could do that by increasing the capacity of the supply chain above the minimum required to supply demand in normal times.  I don't understand the petrol supply chain, but at a minimum there should be reserve tankers and tanker drivers who can be deployed if necessary.  The government should buy fuel to store at petrol stations providing extra storage capacity if necessary.  i bet most of them don't use the storage they have because holding the fuel would conflict with modern business practices of sucking as much cash as possible out of everything (and paying it to the chief executive).  In the event of a fuel emergency, the station would be told to switch to the government owned fuel, and to charge a premium for it.  Maybe this premium would offset the extra costs.

Those are obbvious managerial mistakes completely outside of tactics that have left holes in our squad. on top of that were playing a system that has clearly not worked for our team all season. it's a control system but without any creativity or movement.

His point is that what is called a ""nation"" is just an imagined group, a mental image, that people perceive themselves as belonging to. But upon closer inspection the image has no real substance at all. You will never meet or even see/hear the vast majority of your so-called ""countrymen""; the people with whom you supposedly have a special connection. 

If you do have to belong to an imaginary group why not just make it humanity itself? Why must you have a special duty to someone who by coincidence of birth happended to be born in the same geographical location as you? You might just find that you have much more in common with a member of another country than you do with some of your own ""countrymen"". I feel more of a kinship for example, with socially liberal atheists from the US or Australia than I do with bigoted fundamentalists from the UK. 

Why not just not identify with any imagined community at all? It breeds the kind of tribalistic ""us vs. them"" thinking that has caused so much destruction in modern history, most notably in the two world wars. As Anderson notes: *""Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.""*

true,badge,eng-westmidlands,London from Brum,"&gt; There is nothing in maths at that age that can't be taught with the aid of a terminal and some graphing software.

There is an awful lot in Key Stage 2 in particular that is not amenable to teaching via a terminal and graphing software. From understanding basic algebraic manipulation to the structure of shapes, a terminal will either hide steps necessary to understanding a process (why is 3/12 = 1/4?) or have insufficient power to play around with nets, for example.

Students do need to learn information, in addition to developing understanding, otherwise one finds them unable to find faults in their own work or recognising pre-learned patterns (for instance, seeing why ending up with e^x = -4 *must* be an error, or spotting x^2 – 64 to be the difference of two squares).

Of course that is not to say that using software in mathematics teaching is not worthwhile or beneficial. The first person who had the idea of getting students to learn mathematics using computers was [Seymour Papert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert), who developed the LOGO programming language for just that purpose (Lego’s Mindstorms is named after one of his books). [Geogebra](http://www.geogebra.org/cms/) is a great piece of geometry software that’s used to teach students of all ages some of the things that a terminal can’t.

Two further problems with computers are generating worthwhile feedback for students when their answer is wrong, or identifying equivalent correct answers. In the first case, a teacher is able to point out the cause of a student’s error, such as a failing to multiply out brackets correctly in some longer question (and if a student always does this on a computer they may not understand why 3(x+2y) = 3x + 6y). In the second case, if a teacher wanted a student to answer a question as a fraction in lowest terms, the majority of computer systems would not be able to differentiate between 3/9 and 1/3 (nor, frequently, 0.3333333333). Some of the answers to these last two problems are the subject of my Ph.D.; I assure you we’re trying to programme maths teachers out of a job but it’ll be several decades before we get there!",0,1333311542,null,0,false,0,c47d6y9,t3_rnx9k,t1_c47d6y9,t1_c47caau,null,1428636291,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Every single aspect of it - from the details on the student enrollment forms, the language [PHP], the server it ran on, the guidelines that the ILT Department had to adhere to - **all** of it.

I think this is a *terrible* idea. There's absolutely no doubt that ICT lessons are in desperate need of revamping - teaching kids to code isn't the way to go about it. This topic came up recently due to the Raspberry Pi being in the news - people seem to think dropping a bunch of Pi boards into schools' will generate a new generation of programmers? It won't.

Firstly, the obvious - most teaching staff wouldn't have a first clue how to teach a programming class. You'd need to introduce seasoned programmers, and qualify them to teach. This'd take time and cost a small fortune.

But putting all that to one side - let's look at your average kids computer proficiency. 80% of them have probably never used an operating system that isn't Windows - the ones from more affluent backgrounds might have had Macs, but the vast majority? Windows only. And those who've been using Windows for years - how many of them know anything remotely in depth? How many of 'em can get to the Registry editor for example?

ICT lessons should be compulsory upto year 9. By then kids should be able to use an office suite, be able to do basic upgrades - say installing an OS, partitioning a HDD, and installing RAM / HDDs. That way kids who don't want to continue should - *if they're interested*, at least be able to do the basics on a PC.

I also think that for years 7 - 9, there should be a focus on using computers for practical reasons - budgeting etc.

For kids who take ICT as one of their options? Introduce more complex lessons - say building a PC from scratch, alternate OSs - say how to compile Linux etc, etc.

true,maskedboconut,null,null,"I should clarify. I don't mean that there should be no interaction in teaching mathematics and programming, there should. As I said there is some overlap between both just as there is between physics and maths. Teaching mathematics (and many other subjects) in a computer environment is probably the future of things, but this isn't the same as learning to program.

In general the problem I have is you saying there should be no maths just programming, as that attitude is basically saying they are the same discipline and can be taught together. They can't. 

The study of mathematics and computer science/programming fundamentally have different objectives. Programming involves getting what is a dumb computer to perform a given task, this generally involves learning programming languages, learning how to translate the given task into that language, and then debugging/optimizing it. For programming, mathematics  I would say is mainly a tool for thinking how best to do this process.

In contrast mathematics sees programming just as another tool for the modern mathematician. Mathematics itself is much much more general than programming,  wikipedia defines mathematics as *""the study of quantity, structure, space, and change.""* Computers can certainly help visualise graphs and such, and a simple programming task would be say write a program that can solve any quadratic equation. But the fundamentals of maths can't be taught with programming, unless you just want to train the kid just to use a big calculator (a useful skill admittedly, but not what a maths education should aim to do).

I have many problems with the way they teach mathematics in this country, but your suggestion that maths should be just programming is wrong. I'm not sure if I get this entire integrated and self-directed learning thing you speak of. There are surely limits on how much you can integrate subjects when the fundamental aims of both subjects are not the same.

Exactly, integrated learning. I don't really care what gets taught as long as it produces heightened thresholds of complexity, enthusiasm, creativity, perseverance and self directed discovery.

As good as this style of education sounds I worry it may be too idealised (actually it would be interesting to know if there are any schools where they follow this method, and how exactly it works out). For instance if everything was self-directed it would essentially mean throwing away syllabuses entirely, some guidance from the teachers would be needed to nudge the pupils in productive directions. Bad teacher and no syllabus in this system would lead to very bad results. Also there are some things I think should be compulsive in any education, do we rely on self-directed discovery for this? Some things may occasionally need to be memorised, and quality of writing is still important of course. I'm probably taking your arguments to the extreme and there may be some ideal middle ground between what are education system is like now and a completely self-directed discovery method, great for the Einsteins but maybe not anyone else.

It's strange thinking about it, the type of learning you describe is generally how I approach things in my phd studies, where with no lessons and only some contact with a supervisor everything is entirely self-directed. I enjoy this way of learning, but saying that I also went through exactly the type of exam  focused education you described and I believe that through that I have a good foundation for everything I do now! 

I recognise what you say about universities, which are still very exam focused, and how many people go there not so interested in their subject but what job they get out of it.

true,notorious_kfc,null,null,"I am Catholic, and was brought up in an almost exclusively Catholic area. The default position with most people is that we are Irish and would identify with the Republic more so than the North (I'm making a generalisation here from what I know from family, friends and local attitudes). As for myself, I am completely happy to go by the label ""Northern Irish"" and am a holder of a British passport, albeit for no other reason than it would be posted quicker than the Irish one. Whilst I know this might not go so far as all out identifying with the UK, I do identify with being from NI and therefore by extension, as part of the UK. 

Why? I think it's a sense of pride in what has been achieved in recent times in the North. Whilst I do remember the last years of the Troubles, I'm young enough not to be jaded or bitter about the situation and was lucky enough to be brought up in a family who encouraged me to form my own opinions. Disowning NI would to me feel like ignoring the great effort to restore peace to the area. In ways I see myself as being culturally Irish, through sport, learning the Irish language, etc. But as for nationality, I see myself as a citizen of NI, and by default, the UK. 

The main barrier I have to fully identifying with the UK is through my own experience in living in England. In my first week at university many people asked me if we used Euros in NI, if I had to pay the same fees as ""people from the UK"" and variations on ""do you live near Cork/Dublin/[insert Republic county], I have cousins there?"" despite the fact I always introduced myself as being from NI.

The same is true if you're connecting to an SMTP server directly with a client like Thunderbird or Outlook - only the connection to the SMTP server is (possibly) encrypted. If the email is bound to a non-local destination, that SMTP server will contact the recipient's SMTP server and relay your email in plain text.

There's no issue here. There's nothing that says the Angels took the Doctor after the attacks, although I can see how you'd be confused.

Allow me to continue events for you:

 - Sally Sparrow gives the Doctor the images as he's off to deal with four things and a lizard.

 - The Doctor takes information with him, knowing that ""at some point"" he will need them when Angels attack him.

 - The Doctor travels to some point before 2007 (likely quite close to it) and the Angels escape the pictures and attack him.

 - The Doctor is sent to 1969.

 - The Angels surround the abandon building and attack several people (Nightingale, Detective Shipton).

 - Sally investigates and takes pictures of these Angels.

 - These Angels are tricked into looking at each other and the TARDIS is returned to the Doctor.

 - Sally Sparrow gives the Doctor the images as he's off to deal with four things and a lizard...

It's called the national curriculum (which for me has greater scope than it's pages, just like the monarchy isn't ~~the~~ only the royal family)! I feel everything I learned inside institutions has needed a good decade of deprogramming.

&gt; Conversely if I understand you, programming should turn into maths if that's the way the student wants to take things, right?

Sure, why not? I haven't got everything planned out but I am certain  education services a particular politics (you would think a subject of such self-importance would want itself firmly in the curriculum). I can imagine teachers should guide students through and cultivate a fertile environment for learning rather than enforce the linear one way travel as if on rails, where once you miss your designated train it's hard to come back. The other thing to say is give parents (and adults) more free time so that they don't have to orphan their children to the state for some 30 hours a week (and the rest to Facebook and television).

Memorisation for the sake of memorisation is plainly absurd and a waste of time (if you consider the opportunity cost), and is very different from internalisation.  But yeah programming, or anything else that expands the mind with the nice side effect of a real skill, I'm all for it.

(Actually the more I think about it, the more I see education (from my own point of view at least), just like the supermarket, an illusion of multiplicity.

My son-in-law is black and works in a firm that specialises in finding people who've inherited money but might not know about it. It means he needs to travel a lot and as he specialises in large estates he drives a 5 series BMW. He's on the road about 3-5 days a week and gets stopped about twice a week on average. He accepts it's part of the job, and that people assume he's a drug dealer because he's a black guy who isn't local and drives a BMW, but it pisses him off monumentally that this happens.

I also have another friend of philippino descent. Every time we go out for a meal people look at him, look at me, then assume that I'm paying. The bill always and without question comes to me, the nice, old white man, even when he wants to pay. He also gets a lot of racist shit when he goes out with his family in Essex, getting called a 'chink' from people in restaurants on the table next to him.

I think we miss a lot of the racism that goes on because we're white and perhaps affluent. My son-in-law generally finds that if he wears a suit when driving he still gets pulled over but the police are friendlier than if he drives in more casual clothes. This is a guy that went to University and has a masters in economics. He drives a ford focus on the weekends because if he's pulled over in clothes that could be seen as remotely 'black' (as opposed to my daughter wearing something similar) he'll be waiting a lot longer in the BMW, or have to go to the station in some cases.

I'm pleased to say I'm in broad agreement of most of what you say now, it seems while I was busy talking about the fundamental differences between mathematics and computer science as disciplines, you were talking about taking a different approach to education. We're on the same wavelength now.

I have to admit, this isn't something I've put much thought into before, I've always thought that the education system based on exams and such wasn't very good but never though of how it could be improved. Your point on education servicing a certain type of politics is interesting, and also just what is the current education system preparing each generation for?

I think I have a good metaphor for all this, education and learning is that it's like climbing in some vast mountain range, each set of peaks representing a different field or area of knowledge. Starting off at a young age in school you follow the official ""tourist trail"" with a bunch of porters doing all the heavy lifting for you. Later when this trail is ended, there's the ""advanced tourist trail"" (university, college, etc) which is like the previous tourist trail but with less porters and a bit more heavy lifting. Eventually that ends, the porters are gone and then your left on your own. At this point you can explore this vast mountain range by yourself, perhaps reaching new height no one else has been to before. Or you can stop where you are and just admire the view. The ""tourist trail"" mentality of education encourages people to just stop and admire the view, there's no more tourist trail to follow after all! The better type of education would encourage you to start exploring wherever after the last tourist trail ends, it would mean that you were used to exploring by yourself since your first tourist trail. If we don't teach these kids to explore this learning space by themselves at an early age, they won't continue to do it after their education finished. And that's a problem for our society.

Bringing this back to programming, I think learning to code is one of these things where the importance of doing things yourself (you learn to code by doing coding) is emphasized. I view it atleast as a very self-directed subject (much more so than maths), so hopefully more programming in schools will make a difference.",0,1333322948,null,0,false,0,c47ewmw,t3_rnx9k,t1_c47ewmw,t1_c47ebzd,null,1428637090,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

After 10 years of 30 hour weeks I had nothing of consequence to show apart from being too smart for my own good, basically having iterated over the same subject matter of literary comprehension and examiner deception (even if it was French or in diagram form).

(Looking back I may have beaten high school in the second year, lost interest there after, but still managed to get full marks on two geography A-level exams some years later because I knew how to game the system. I had met the minimum deemed necessary to be a 'high' functioning peon later in life, and the system wanted no more. Meanwhile I was separated from some incredibly fundamental concepts, most importantly the dangerous ones of politics and economic 'theory'.)

Programming is an endeavour where the question doesn't often deny scope, and a capable student can pursue usually unending levels of complexity, whilst getting instant feedback (an absolute necessity for learning). Like the carpenter who used to build his own tools for later work, the programmer does the same creating algorithms and techniques to apply else where, perhaps in his area of chosen specification. Marshalling or finding patterns in data is fundamental to any subject, just like good language skills, so I don't see computer science as discreet. (Of course that breaks with the capitalist ideal of specialisation and the alienated worker.)

If I was to design a system standardising the population to a safe level of knowledge while disempowering personal skills, limiting personal wealth generation, and creating a situation where even the most capable don't know the whole picture enough to escape the dependency on the state and corporations for employment, it would look very much like our school systems.

AVB - I'm skeptical. His Chelsea tenure showed that he's ridiculously stubborn tactically, refusing to play anything other than his ideology. Also, his communication and man management are questionable - regardless of the size of egos in Chelsea's dressing room, clear communication is always important, and Di Matteo seems to be benefitting from providing that.

Unai Emery - Don't know much about him, but to keep Valencia consistently 3rd while losing a world-class player for 3 consecutive seasons is a good achievement. Would prefer Rafa back, though.

Klopp - Has already turned down Chelsea, won't leave Dortmund. Don't know enough about him, but he's obviously achieved a lot at Dortmund.

Also, Lucien Favre hasn't been mentioned - great counterattacking stuff at Borussia Moglendenbach. Again, doubt he'd leave with the team doing so well.

But, **most importantly**, Kenny deserves at least another season; at that point there can't be any suggestions of the team needing to gel or players being injured. I'm not going to try and second-guess whether he'll leave himself. That's up to him. We're honestly only *one* player away from the top 4.

true,robosatan,null,null,"Here's my letter:

Dear John Woodcock,

I would like to bring to your attention the plans to monitor internet usage of all British Citizens. A Home Office report regarding these plans can be found on the BBC news website [1].


Ignoring the Orwellian outrage it is causing among the population that are aware of these plans. I would like to ask how effective it will be, I would like to know under which study this effectiveness was observed and I would like to know how much it would cost to implement.


The reason for my first two questions is probably best described through a little hypothetical scenario. Lets imagine there is to be a clamp down on corruption politicians. The solution proposed is that all records relating to a politicians duties must be fully disclosed to an investigative branch. What money they receive, with whom the politicians meet and how they vote in parliament are all to be made transparent and available to scrutiny. Would this action cause a _significant_ decrease in corruption within parliament? Would those capable of such dishonesty not just simply find ways around them? An offshore bank account for their early retirement or discussing corrupt voting habits outside the ear-reach. My point I guess, is that no matter how hard you try to monitor something with pre-emptive law enforcement  there are often very simple ways to circumvent it. 


When it comes to secure communications this is very simple to circumvent. Firstly, if you're going to host any illicit content you can simply use an offshore provider who outside the jurisdiction of UK law. If you want the things you discuss kept secret then you can simply use an encrypted communications channel. The latter being especially effective in counteracting the proposed law. If you're unaware of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) take a moment to search about them on google. In short, they are secure connections that provided encrypted connections from point A to point B. You cannot ban their use because a number of businesses depend on them for secure communication of sensitive information and their use is so widespread you can even rent a service for a single day when required and appear to the rest of the internet as being located in any major city in the world.


The questionable nature of the proposed laws effectiveness  aside. My last question addresses the cost which is not explicitly quoted in the proposal. I ask because I have a feeling it is without a doubt one of the most expensive undertakings proposed since the national ID card. 


In the report, it is proposed that all communication be held for 2 years before disposal. According to the OfCom website there are currently 18.4 million fixed residential broadband connections [2]. This does not include mobile broadband or business use. According to OfCom each connection averages around 17gb of use per month [3]. Using these numbers this places the amount of raw data to be stored at just shy of 7 exabytes. One exabyte is equivalent of every word spoken by a human being ever [4]. 


As you can imagine that's quite a lot of information to store. You would need 7.5 million 1 Terabyte hard drives (1 Terabyte = 1,000 Gigabytes) which at around £60 a pop would cost £450 million alone. That figure does not include power costs, the replacement of failed drives, any of the other computer hardware required to access them or the staff required to run the service.


I'd also like to take the time to question the security of such a service. By it's nature it is required to be connected to the internet and this pretty much throws out any argument that this service can be completely secured from those whom wish to access it. Relevant examples of this are numerous, just google ""bank hacked"" or ""government records hacked"". Under the assumption that nothing on the internet is safe, why would anybody in their right mind think that storing all the information passed through it as a good idea? Not only does a breach in security allow access to all the information but also compromises the validity information itself.

So, what is this proposal really? Well in summary, you have a Billion Pound solution based on little to no scientific study, that can be trivially circumvented through secure connections and which will almost undoubtedly be compromised by a third party leaving the questionable authenticity of data stored on it. Or as most people would summarise, simply ""a bad idea"".


Yours sincerely,


Chris Jordan

true,[deleted],null,null,"I didn't work for a LD - but that's one of the big problems with major campaigns like 38degrees. 

1) Constituent Widgetas contacts MP Derp for Derpington. 

2) Caseworker Derpette gets the email along with 300 others (of which 298 are identical) with the same email header. 

3) Caseworker Derpette loves her job, but has 300 emails (plus the other 'normal work) so probably around 200 'live' cases. She only has so many hours in the day.  

4) Caseworker Derpette then asks central office for the party line on issue '38 degrees', and notifies Derp MP that there is a major issue ongoing. 

5) Because every MP has been getting 300 identical emails a day, they are putting pressure on central office (or Government) to act/come up with a line/not hopefully annoy their constituents.)

6) A party line is drafted by SPADs/researchers in London, and sent to constituency offices/Westminster offices UK wide. This can take anywhere from 3 hours to 3 weeks. If the Government is pandering, or worried, several lines can be issued (i.e, old one retracted, new one in place, so Constituent Widgetas might get a different letter than say, constituent herpington over the course of a week).

7) Derpette then has the wonderful job of drafting 300 identical letter replies. Of course making sure it says 'Dear Widgetas' and not Dear 'Derpington, among other things) Then, Derpette must identify the 2 letters in 298 that have a personalised message, and adapt the letter to reply to that. (That could, sometimes mean another email to central office.)

8) Derpette still has to deal with the normal flow of work (which is large, and doesn't go away because 38 degrees have got a bee in their bonnet).

9) MP Derp then goes through all the letters, reads them all, will often read the original correspondence if necessary. This usually takes place on a constituency day which all constituency staff find to be hugely disruptive to the work routine.

10) Derpette then posts said signed letters.

11) ???

12) Profit.


Now, can you see the potential for things to go wrong? This entire process takes anywhere from a day or two, to 2 months. This process usually also involves MP Herp (i.e. Derpette) writing to the Minister in charge of the issue and asking for further comments. When a reply is received constituent Widgetas would then get ANOTHER letter from MP Herp with the reply from the Minister.

So yes, sometimes you would get the wrong or outdated reply. It's a problem that happens once in, roughly, every 300 letters. This is because poor Derpette who is paid basically just above minimum wage for very, very long hours is most probably alone in the office dealing with this huge influx. Things have to move quickly.

The moral of the story?

Derpette now works in the private sector, along with every other MP's staff who doesn't go to central office. Turnover is yearly, most constituency staff last a year - Westminster between 1 and 2. Some hack it for as little as 6 months.

Oh, and as Bix783 points out below: MP's surgeries are excellent, you get to talk to MP Herp face to face. A much better solution.

It does however mean Derpette worked Saturdays too :(

Programming is actually pretty easy and most people could probably learn how to write useful programs in a couple of weeks. What they can't learn is how to think like a computer scientist, or at least a *good* computer scientist that sees programs as abstract maths problems; yes even PHP websites hosting nothing but pictures of cats are just maths problems dressed up in cowboy uniforms.

Maths training takes years, and even then you'll probably know basically nothing; but everyone is a geometer, everyone is a statistician, they just don't realise it.

You need to think in an abstract manner to solve problems, programming problems are logically more ""pure"" than other types of problems we face 

Get out of the idea that we need to teach things to kids &lt; 16 that are entirely practical. Obviously practicality is still important, but I use algebra and stats every day and woodwork basically never. Do I regret doing woodwork? Hell no! I can build furniture if I want to (though maybe of dubious quality) but it isn't a mythical process I see as being guarded by tyrannical carpenters.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"Let's hope that something like this never happens again. Some would argue that it's not worth maintaining the Falklands, that the lives lost in defending the islands was a waste. But I disagree. And before people start harping on about ""imperialism"" and ""Britain's colonial power in decline"", it's not about any of that crap. It's about the right for people not to be forced out of their homes. It's about people not being forced out of their homes at the whims of governments. 

Yes war is a tragedy, but I would argue (and I know others would agree) that those soldiers who died in the defense of the Falklands didn't waste their lives on behalf of a corrupt imperialistic power, they died defending the freedom of the people of those islands, which is often considered a noble thing.

In a democratic society it is a heinous crime to forcibly relocate even one person against their will. I am glad to know that the UK will go to the defense of those unable to defend themselves.

I appreciate Argentina's position, I even sympathize. They feel they are being cheated out of something they consider is rightfully theirs, but this is the way it is, and we need to respect our sovereign borders. I will not go as far as to accuse Argentina of being the archaic imperialist power it accuses Britain of being, because that's non-sensical. I think we all agree the age of colonialism is long gone. But their stubborn stance is reminiscent of the very thing they accuse Britain of being... Perhaps it really is just a ploy to distract from internal problems, but as long as the islanders wish to remain British, and as long as the UK continues to respect the right of the individual to independence and self-determination, I don't see anything productive emerging from any talks on the subject.

TL;DR: UK soldiers didn't waste their lives, they died defending freedom. I feel sorry for Argentina but the issue isn't really up for debate...",0,1333358271,null,0,false,0,c47jkdr,t3_rp9fw,t1_c47jkdr,t3_rp9fw,null,1428639346,46,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,46

Which became irrelevant once the Argentinians invaded.

If you mean the decision by the Argentinians, yes it was.

Fight = Defend. There's a difference.

What, like the Argentinians did? Try as you might, you're not going to be able to make the UK out to be the agressor, Sorry.

Compromise....why? Did the natives want to leave? No. Did Argentina have a valid claim? No. And the Argentinians decided not to avoid any conflict by instigating one.

Furthermore, the original source of this article is the Daily Mirror (linked [here](http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Liverpool-Andy-Carroll-aims-f-word-parting-shot-at-Kenny-Dalglish-article885811.html) so don't click on it if you don't like them). I just thought the source of such an alleged tirade is important.

The entirety of the Mirror's article is here:

&gt;The £35million striker’s foul-mouthed tirade came as he was subbed 11 minutes from the end of another embarrassing defeat.
&gt;
&gt;Carroll, who had earlier been booked for diving and was mocked by Toon fans throughout, made no attempt to hide his feelings before marching down the tunnel. To add  to Liverpool’s misery, Pepe Reina was sent off for violent conduct, dipping his head into James Perch, and departed the pitch offering the Newcastle defender a fight.
&gt;
&gt;Carroll stormed off the pitch red-faced and close to tears, growling: “F###### joke this, f###### shit, f### off,” towards the dug out.
&gt;
&gt;He is suspended for the next three games including the FA Cup semi final with Everton. Carroll, who was booked for diving in the penalty area, also clashed with Pardew on the touchline, telling his former boss: “It wasn’t a dive you f###### c###.”
&gt;
&gt;Dalglish said: “It ended up with a lot of frustration and disappointment and I think the frustration and disappointment was a result of the actions that Pepe took.
&gt;
&gt;“He got a deserved red card. And then Andy came off and went up the tunnel. He was frustrated with the way the game had gone. Not just for himself but for the team. We have not got a problem with people showing disappointment or frustration. But we need to channel it better than we have done.”
&gt;
&gt;Asked if Reina had apologised in the dressing room, Dalglish added: “There was a bit of remorse there, yes.”
&gt;
&gt;On Carroll’s dive, Dalglish added: “It wasn't a penalty kick. I also thought Andy was losing his balance anyway.”",0,1333375643,null,0,true,0,c47l3dt,t3_rpg48,t1_c47l3dt,t3_rpg48,null,1428640067,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

That isn't what tends to happen though, they split off assets and pocket the profits from selling those assets. They do not create viable businesses.  In that case, I'd prefer it was not done by private asset strippers who have lied to get the company from the receivers.

 When a company goes into receivership, it is the job of the receivers to either split the company up and use the funds to repay the creditors, or sell it on as a going concern. If they sell it on to a company that just secretly intends to do the receiver's job, but pocket the money instead of paying back the creditors, then the next time the company goes into receivership the receivers have nothing to pay back the creditors with.

I agree that the things which made them popular in the past should be maintained, but socialism needs to be explained in a more compact way. Socialism should still be the goal and be worked towards, in my opinion, but to give it credibility you need to be able to elaborate beyond 'We believe in socialism'.

'Socialism' as a term means very little to the electorate at large. At it's core is the notion of fairness. You can still achieve socialism but people need to know what it means for them in order to get votes. Vague rhetoric about Marxist theory does not get votes, except from those who understand it or want to understand it.

The effective management of public owned businesses is almost impossible. The unions hold the power and senior managers have to seek government approval before getting into a strike scenario. The government rarely allow this to occur (though the public may think differently there are thousands of 'near miss' events every year) this causes good quality managers who are sick of being told what to do by union member to leave and move into the private sector, this in turn leaves the weak managers at the mercy of the unions. 
I remember government owned railways - they were fucking shit, inefficient and a worldwide joke. The electricity grid was forever fucked with power cuts by the tens every fucking year, ditto for the water, gas companies etc.....anything government run is doomed to failure because of weak management and political fear. I have been very close to this issue for 25 years in several industries. There is no ultimate responsibility in public companies because when it really comes right down to it the senior managers are not permitted to make the big decisions, those decisions are made by politicians who always ultimately bow to the union - undermining their own management team and strengthening the union position every time. They only have to be minister for X for 2 years before moving on and don't want trouble on their watch so the cycle is perpetual....public companies are not just inefficient they are fucking disgracefully inefficient costing the uk taxpayer billions every year. The unions rape the organisations every time until privatisation is the only answer.  The only answer because the organisation can't take the cost imposed by unions but nobody is going to commit political suicide by taking the unions on because the public always think they have the fucking answer without any understanding at all of what the real issues are. two glances at a daily mail headline and they can solve something that a politician would give his left knacker to solve.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"Real world experience is being up against the hard edge - at the sharp end . This can be all sorts of jobs but it's any job that is directly related to design and development and production of products and services . The more remote from that the less real world it is . Any job where the person is insulated from the effects of their actions is not real world .

The PM's lack of real world experience was a very clear problem coming up to the election and I certainly flagged it several times and made the suggestion that he should get a broad range of engineering experience , particularly doing things such as learning basic engineering skills . This could be anything from metal work to hot riveting to welding even through to electronics hardware and computer software . Basically skills where he could learn to deal with things logically and where he could achieve results on the basis of his decisions and actions . I suggested that he do a series of workshop and factory visits and work alongside the staff - get hands on experience . I also suggested that a trip into the countryside of Western Australia , particularly into the mining towns , would be very beneficial .

However real world experience can be a lot broader than just engineering , it can be medical , it can be physics , chemistry and mathematics in industry , it can be hands on business management .

Margaret Thatcher certainly had it courtesy of her parents grocery shop and her husband probably helped out a lot .

The problem is that the PM has existed only in the academic , PR and political worlds - all very remote from reality and very remote from him hearing any suggestions that he is doing anything wrong . IE. situations where it is very difficult for him to find out that his proposals are wrong and how to think them through . Hence he keeps making very basic and silly mistakes .

There is no 'perfect amount of experience' . The important thing is very broad experience spread over a very broad range of people . The advantage of the parliamentary system is that this should be easily possible if the people are available . That experience should not be all in political related jobs , PR , quangos etc. . Although these are helpful they should only form a minor part of the experience .

Working in low end jobs and surviving on a low income certainly is useful experience but shouldn't be the only experience - it's the sort of experience that the youngesters can get but they should then move on from that .

Small business experience along with technical skills is good experience . Engineering is very good experience as it trains the person in thinking through designs and implementation . Brezhnev and Hoover being examples of engineers who ended up leading their respective countries .

Anyway the way prescription prices work in the NHS in England is that everybody pays the same price per item regardless of the price the NHS has to pay for said item. At the moment this is £7.65, but before the 1st of April I think it was £7.40. This means that while some people pay more for their medicine than what the NHS does, costs are kept low for others who take extremely expensive medicines. For example, off the top of my head, Truvada tablets that are commonly used for AIDS sufferers cost about 400 quid per box!

Also, as mentioned elsewhere, if you suffer from certain conditions you get all your prescriptions free of charge. These conditions are hypothyroidism, diabetes and epilepsy.

But seriously, I generally agree with everything you've written. Why would so many inherently selfish species make alliance with each other? Why not, as you've pointed out, simply disintegrate the Doctor instead of trapping him in what's deemed the ""perfect"" prison?

Suspension of disbelief requires me to concede that okay, maybe even the most selfish of races understand that the destruction of the universe puts something of a crimp in their plans to dominate said universe. And that they don't have the resources to solve the problem on its own. Furthermore, we don't know why the TARDIS blows up and neither does River -- who was piloting it at the time. But okay, in spite of River's demonstrated prowess at piloting the TARDIS (she can land it without the parking break engaged, unlike the Doctor) she mysteriously screws up and can't fix it.

It still doesn't make up for the numerous plot holes and clear abuse of *deus ex machina* by Moffat.

To be fair, that's not the first time they kept him alive for silly reasons.

Daleks : 'No, keep him alive, we must retrieve the information of Daleks defeats from his mind!' I mean, surely once Davros learned they had suffered so many defeats, he would already have ideas as to how and why, he was a genius but couldn't figure that out on his own?

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"fairly decent advice, however relying on ssl to protect your browsing is not a good idea.

for a start, most people never check that the ssl certificate their browser shows is legit - and browsers often only check that it matches the website, not that it's actually them. There's also been quite a few instance of universities and schools faking these in order to monitor https communications - if they can do it you can be sure the govt can.

a VPN would be a better option, but these often cost, and you need to be sure of the security of the end point - if the datacentre/server it runs is compromised, it won't help. So ideally you'd want this in a non western country that doesnt have a good law enforcement relationship with the UK, but of course these tend to be in places with slower connections, so there's a natural trade off.

and if your own computer isn't secure to begin with, there's that risk too.

and hell, even if it is, if someone really wants to know what you are doing, they can [park a van across the street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST)  - the equipment to do it over a 100m distance was proven to cost $15 in 1985 - 27 years ago.

One obvious difference is that marriage is an internationally recognized way of giving legal status to a partnership. A civil partnership in the UK is [not internationally recognized](http://www.lgbt-ep.eu/press-releases/european-parliament-wants-eu-countries-to-recognise-existing-same-sex-unions/), even by states that have same sex marriage. To put it simply: A married straight couple from the UK can go to Spain (which has gay marriage) and have their marriage recognized. A civil partner'd gay couple can't do this. They also can't get married in Spain.

Why's this important? Married status is just as important when you're overseas as when you're at home. Simple example - say two UK civil partners are on vacation to Spain and one gets sick. One would not necessarily be able to visit the other in hospital. Or say they decide to settle down in Canada. Again, their relationship would not be recognized as the same thing as marriage, even though Canada respects same sex marriage.

[For example](http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/UK_civil_union_is_not_marriage_feds-10873.aspx)

&gt; Hincks and his partner, both Canadian citizens, were joined in a civil union in the UK before returning to Canada to live. But when the relationship ended and he tried to file divorce proceedings, he was informed that his civil partnership wasn’t equivalent to a civil marriage under Canadian law.
 
&gt; “Please be advised that the Attorney General of Canada will be intervening in this proceeding to oppose the issuance of a declaration that a civil partnership registered in the United Kingdom is a ‘marriage’ for the purpose of the Civil Marriage Act and that the parties to such a partnership are spouses within the meaning of the Divorce Act,” reads the letter from Nicholson’s office.

In other words, the situation's a mess because the UK's refusing to use the standard, internationally recognized definition of marriage. Basically a UK civil partnership confers many but not all as the same rights as marriage - it's a second-class institution designed to keep gays away from actual marriage. 

At any rate even if it were just the same in terms of rights it would still be unacceptable, discriminatory and second-class. Imagine if inter-racial couples could only get civil partnerships.

By the way, note the current UK legislative proposal is for same-sex civil marriage, not religious marriage - something the church is deliberately obfuscating, to make christians think their churches will be forced to marry same-sex couples. This isn't on the table at all, in fact same-sex religious marriage will still be banned.",0,1333397544,null,0,false,0,c47p9l4,t3_rppyp,t1_c47p9l4,t1_c47n4sj,null,1428642048,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I am honestly perplexed as to why this is taboo or could be offensive to the quality of this subreddit, as there are no rules or guidelines on what to post.

I don't see how this is missing the point. If it is to you, then I suggest having the mods coming up with rules or guidelines as to not alienate people that, a) find this offensive, and b) want to post something they find humorous.

Why would they ever work together/gain by teaming up? This one depends on your belief that the Doctor is a very dangerous person. It's meant to convey how dangerous the Doctor must be. Maybe it wasn't driven home for you, (personal preference), enough.

Why not hop in? You can't do anything in there but get stuck forever and ever. Even if you survived the end of the universe, you'd be trapped in there and if you ever got out, you'd be bored out of your mind. There would be infinite nothingness. They had to use the box to stop the Doctor from blowing up the universe (and failed because River can pilot the TARDIS so that Dalek was wrong...).

Sonic screwdriver? Well yeah that is kind of fail. Like the Death Star. All I can say. Maybe the different kinds of settings the screwdriver has are too numerous/versatile to anticipate and deadlock.

You're right about why would the Silence want to blow up the TARDIS. I've no idea.

Why use the Pandorica? Because it has the restoring field. The Pandorica and the TARDIS may have molecules from the 'previous universe' but the Pandorica is the one with the restoration field. Plus while what River says makes no technical sense, it's a good way to visualize things, like making analogies. It's like ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey""- just a phrase to explain stuff quicker.

They used Amy's room for the Romans and Pandorica, not the Autons. The Autons were the means to recreate the Roman setting (idk why not brainwash real Romans, nobody is efficient). Why use her room at all? Because making it relate to Amy Pond makes him really curious. I guess you don't need an incentive to investigate something (since it's what the Doctor always does), but everyone likes an extra teaser to get you thinking. It wasn't necessary, but helped the odds of him taking a look (because the coalition doesn't know him as well as the audience does and of his overwhelming curiosity).

You absolutely have contributed well to this community and I certainly appreciate your presence around here. The point of my previous comment was to not make you feel any of that at all and I'm genuinely sorry that it did. I hope you don't take that rant personally, it wasn't meant to be. It was the airing out of some feelings that I've felt for some time now.

You're absolutely correct that are no submission guidelines, nor will I be writing any because in general the subreddit is very well run by the community, as I've tried my best to encourage people on here to do.

&gt; I know you have good intentions and are a fair mod, but are you the official word on what is allowed or not? 

Awkwardly yes I could be if I wanted to, but I have no desire to be so no I am not; being a jackass mod is something I never, ever want to be. I want to create and encourage a very positive space for CFC fans. In the end it is up to the community to decide on what it wants, and I continually try to uphold that. That's why I posted a comment asking for feedback as opposed to removing it; I believe the spam filter removed this too, and I approved it despite my personal objections to it.

You've not really done anything wrong, and I think in some sense I'm making a non-issue here. But seeing the last NFW/nakedish female post get reported has made me think about it a lot, possibly too much. There's the possibility that there's a minority (let's be honest, there's few females around here. I only know of one female on here) that would maybe object to this but not feel up to speaking up. That's why I'm speaking up.

Can you understand where I'm coming from? This is absolutely not an attempt to make you feel bad, discourage you from posting or contributing to the community or anything like that. I'm just anticipating that maybe these posts are obstacles to a larger and more diverse community.

He's begging them to listen because he thinks they're about to make a terrible mistake and he feels powerless to do anything to stop it.

And the Doctor doesn't travel in time to save himself all the time because he can't interfere with his own time stream. They say so much in several episodes, in specific Smith and Jones when he says he can only do it for cheap tricks. (Which is why the Doctor saving himself *and* his enemies not killing him in a one-two punch of suspension-of-disbelief shattering flaws really upsets the episode).

I know the Doctor's dangerous, but he's *mortal*. Just one fleet would have done it for him. I mean, even the worst of the worst know that the Doctor only tricks people into destroying themselves and always gives people a second chance. He is just one man, and in this instance one man who is right in your sights totally unarmed and defenseless.

Well that didn't stop the Daleks from hopping into a Void ship or the Time Lords from preparing to ascend to a new form of existence. The Daleks don't care how many of them there are so long as there is nothing else. So long as the only life in the universe is Dalek.

And it's not too ridiculous to think that if they could build an impenetrable prison with a rejuvenating interior that can last the end of the universe one can imagine they can build an impenetrable prison with a rejuvenating interior that can last the end of the universe *with a handle on the inside*.

No, this would be like if the Rebels would carry proton torpedoes with them everywhere they go and that every rebel soldier was inextricably linked to their favorite photon torpedo and the only thing that can destroy the Death Star is a photon torpedo lazily swished at it. This is laughable especially because deadlocking is common technology. IF the Doctor can't open up an Adipose nanny's computer, but can open up the single most secure prison in the universe, you really ought to rethink your security systems.

But the Doctor didn't even realize the connection with Amy until *after* he realized it was a trap. And even then, how does the Amy connection help? The Doctor was already interested in the trap and ready to walk into it *without knowing it had anything to do with Amy*. Why connect it to Amy at all? There are a billion other ways to get the Doctor curious. Make the Box say that it's another trapped time Lord. Make the Box say that it contains a way to save his family from the Time War.

Cops constantly upping the ante with stuff like this - very short sighted of them. Chickens have a pretty regular habit of coming home to roost, as the August Uprisings showed.

Just in case you missed it, there will be no enquiry into Mark Duggans death, no reform of police tactics in light of the tragedy - the police will carry on following their policy of being ""the biggest gang"" and using violence to intimidate their enemies.

The fact that police officers, whilst on duty, are currently 'above the law' cannot be contested with any credibility, but as circumstances change (i.e. the working class wakes from its stupor and takes over the running of things), many of these officers will be retrospectively punished for their crimes. I, for one, am very much looking forward to that time.

I just wish those who support the firing of a taser at someone who doesn't do exactly what the police say when they say it could also be held accountable, but as i support a person's right to anonymity and free speech, i suppose we have to let it ride.

And despite being mortal, tons of legends have been made up about him and as legends go, they get exaggerated and more and more apocryphal. That's why everyone was freaked out. And plus, the Doctor defeated that Cyberman fleet easy, and it seems that entire planets and races seem to fail. For someone whose mortal that you can just shoot twice with a gun, he seems to make it out of impossible situations. That's why the coalition took such exaggerated precautions- exacerbated stories and fact.

Again- if you got out of the Pandorica with the indoor handle, you'd walk into a universe of nothingness. You and the Pandorica would be the only things left. You would be the universe. How boring is that?

The logic behind not making it sonic-proof would be that the Doctor was stuck inside the Pandorica so he wouldn't be able to sonic it from the outside..being stuck in there and all. It sounds simple, but of course their arrogance and oversight of someone else using the screwdriver is what proves the aliens' downfall. Everyone makes a fatal mistake. It really doesn't bother me.

So the aliens failed to judge the Doctor's character well- he didn't figure it out so he didn't get curious. Back luck for them. On the flip side, they got lucky because the Doctor's the curious kind of guy who would explore that stuff.

Why connect to Amy? Sure there are a billion other ways and if we'd picked a different one you'd still be asking the same question. The real flaw is that he didn't catch on so it didn't become a teaser- at which point I come back to the 'bad luck scenario'.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1333401719,null,0,false,0,c47q69s,t3_rq2o6,t1_c47q69s,t3_rq2o6,null,1428642461,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
true,nomalas,null,null,"&gt;Awkwardly yes I could be if I wanted to, but I have no desire to be so no I am not; being a jackass mod is something I never, ever want to be.

This was a honest question, so no need to feel awkward about it, I just was unsure.

I can definitely understand where you are coming from and like I said, I did not want to offend anyone. I can understand you taking a reported post into account and not wanting to alienate anyone, but I must posit--where is the line drawn? Surely other posts (non-sexual; I hesitate calling this post that as there is no nudity or any sexual depiction), have been reported or if not, could be reported and cause you to wonder what is allowed or not. 

&gt;here's the possibility that there's a minority (let's be honest, there's few females around here. I only know of one female on here) that would maybe object to this but not feel up to speaking up. That's why I'm speaking up.

Again, I am not questioning your integrity, and feel you are an exceptional mod; but, I don't know if this is the right mindset to be had on this matter. Many things (like cursing or off-colored jokes) can be found offensive to certain minorities, so how does one tip-toe around such matters? I guess it falls down to one's own ethics and judgment, and in this case, I did not feel that this would be offensive to anyone, or if it would, they had the option of not viewing it (as it is marked NSFW just in case).

&gt;I'm just anticipating that maybe these posts are obstacles to a larger and more diverse community.

I completely understand this sentiment, and while I think it could be a slippery slope to say, could see how one could be worried with posts like mine leading to ""This naked girl has a Lampard jersey painted on her chest"" and things of that nature. But I feel this leads back to the poster's judgment (since there are no guidelines). In this case, this is the first NSFW image I have posted on this subreddit (and maybe even all subreddits) and didn't think that it would be a big deal.

I can easily refrain from posting things like this in the future, but, in all honesty, will feel that I am being ordered on what or what not to post, which is a feeling I don't enjoy much. 

I guess I just feel like that if something is disliked by the r/chelseafc community, it will get downvoted into oblivian, or removed completely by the mods (if it is clearly inappropriate: see gore/porn).

Previously (in New Who, Classic Who got away with it *much* more) they would use the idea of not just killing the Doctor sparingly, often involving hostages or explicitly stating why they need him alive. In this no such reasoning is given, and so it feel like the idea is being abused.

What bugs me is that this is Stonehenge. This is *loooooong* before a lot of what the Doctor does has actually happened. Are you meaning to tell me that every last one of those species that arrived are capable of time travel? Some of them must be from this period (and thus might not have even fought the Doctor yet, and that's just confusing).

And even then, it's not like legends of the Doctor have stopped them from trying to kill him before. Several times. No. *Many* times his enemies have tried to kill him just like any other nuisance. Even the Sontarans understand that although he's a great warrior, he can certainly be killed like any other man.

Boring, but to some species that's all they want. No one said the Daleks were sane.

Yeah, particularly since they *know* the Doctor has many friends, several of them having sonic devices (i.e. Sarah Jane) or otherwise having access to a Sonic Tool that could also time travel to this event. I would be less annoyed if deadlocking wasn't so common. The Doctor tries to get into an Adipose Nanny's computer... deadlocked, no good. Tries to get into the single most secure vault in the universe... swish, he's in.

Yes, but that still doesn't make sense. Why Amy? I mean really, how could the Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen *et al* not know about him having companions with sonics, him being able to die easily, or that he's not even the one causing the cracks but they *do* know of the person he's gone on a meager handful of adventures with (many so private that  they wouldn't catch on like Amy's Choice or Vincent and the Doctor or The Lodger) and will use her (well, not even her. That would be a *good* idea, no they're just using a vauge construction of her memories that don't even relate to Amy directly, and it would take looking at the Romans and the Pandorica and then going into her room and looking around to figure it out). That's the single worst idea ever when they could, I dunno... kidnap Martha and Mickey. Or Donna. Or literally any human being.

Yes but the point is that the Legends are bigger than ever. There's a bit of suspension of belief in this- you have to believe that the legends have really gotten out of control. Or because they hear the Doctor is going to blow up the universe they decide to finally stop him once and for all and know it's going to take a lot of ammo (when actually he didn't, his TARDIS did on accident).

No one said the Daleks were sane. With that argument, any mistake on their part can be excused. And they could threaten any alien alliance buds of theirs with extermination and superior TT tech if they disagreed. /:d

How could the Daleks and etc. not know? Well it's not exactly advertised. Maybe one Dalek or one random Cyberman sees a companion holding a sonic. Maybe it's the Doctors, maybe they lost it. The aliens don't know its specifically their sonic device. I mean, one human sees a man holding a hot dog, it doesn't mean the rest of the humans are going to know that man is holding a hot dog. The Daleks' brains aren't all interconnected, all the Daleks throughout history don't collate their data. Same with the non-TT capable aliens.

He *can't* die easily that's the problem. Physically he can, but he's too good at staying alive, that's the whole point. How could they know it *wasn't* the Doctor that blew up the universe? Their logic was: We detected the TARDIS as the cause, only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS, therefore it must be the Doctor who is the cause, therefore we should prevent him from doing this.

As for knowing so much about Amy this is simple. One of the coalition sees who he's traveling with, does some info snooping, and they form the plan. I mean, they'd have to use a *current* companion after all (for real life reasons, plus it's more convenient since Amy obviously won't be at home). After the snooping they make a plan based around the Romans and Pandorica, not the other way around.

Why use a better plan like the Time Lords? There are probably many ""better"" plans than the one they came up with. There's always room with improvement. If they did that, you'd still be picking at something else. Perhaps you'd be complaining that they're using Time Lords yet again in the show.

When it comes down to it, you just don't like how much suspension of belief there is in this. But we can't explore Plato's cave forever and examine and question every minutiae and continue to say what *could've* been done better in the aliens' plans. They suck at plans- it must've been hard with so many opposing sides to come to an agreement.

Everything you address and question can be explained with all the weird logic I throw at you. We can keep doing this, at some point I'll start citing ""Off screen explanations that maybe we don't get to see and never will find out about because we don't know everything about the universe."" This is the explanation I give for things like 'half human Doctor' in 1996 movie (explained in The Forgotten comic).

Some of the greatest British science fiction has been made with a bit of a ""who cares, throw it in if it's funny"" sort of attitude. One of my favorite science fictions *of all time* are the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books, and they'll have living mattresses and flying sofas and people turning into penguins.

Part of science fiction, particularly this new form of British Science Fiction, is in the absurdism, is in the absolute bizarre and oddball depiction of the future. And that's what Doctor Who has become.

Legends grow as time goes on. At this point in time there would be legends, yes, but almost all of his adventures take place after Stonehenge. The legends would be there, but they would hardly be as monumental as they suggest.

The Slitheen (members of the Coalition) are *very* familiar with Sarah Jane. Assuming that these Slitheen are from the future (as in, they've met with and want to kill the Doctor) than they'd have already met Sarah Jane and her sonic lipstick multiple times. Ditto for the Judoon.

If the Doctor was going to destroy the universe and I am a Cyberman and I have him surrounded, and he's defenseless, and he's clearly mortal I would logically kill him. Sontarans don't take prisoners, they'd just slay him in combat. There's no reason to keep him alive. You would think that *just one* of them would at the very least *try* to kill him.

But what's the goal to this plan? It's not even apparent that it's connected to Amy. If anything, the Amy connection was never intentional, as nobody figures it out until they literally look at the Romans and Pandorica and then at the images in Amy's room. It's almost as if they *didn't* want the Doctor to notice the connection, but if that's the case *why the hell would they use this plan!?*

Sure they can occasionally get stick for doing that but that can happen when you push your own world views on others - no need to draw the big guns but just keep on being civil and better supporter.

No disrespect, but the phenomenon you're talking about isn't anything new, neither is your proposed solution - and the solution has its major downsides that can be observed on some well established supporter forums. What I consider as that there's certain kind of forced political correctness, sometimes heartless enforcement of rules which, imho, alienates quite a few newer (and/or not so ""established"") supporters.

Your link has a point but it misses another: the medium we use here gives rise to some of the problems:
anonymity takes away social penalties thus opinions get amplified and more extreme; text is a very reduced, single channel communication method in which a lot of information, especially emotional kind, is lost thus misinterpretation happens more often. I think there's a couple of more points which I don't seem to remember right now.

He has pace, good passing, good ball control, good vision, and a solid shot. (look at videos from his loan period, he did quite well). I could very well be dead wrong but I see infinite more potential in him than I do in a player like Carroll. 

I also believe he is almost as good as Adam is even though he is much younger. Adam is lazy, non-athletic, and is a horrible defensive player. Shelvey has some pace, better vision, and you see him all over the field.

He shouldn't be Liverpool's first choice for a few years but in time I'd bet on him doing very well and developing into a fine player.

Why would the Coalition Slitheen be from the future? They're not TT capable are they? Ditto for Judoon. If not, then they wouldn't know of SJ.

Yeah, but if the Cyberman/Judoon killed the Doctor, the format of the show would require us to bring him back (face it, it seriously would happen at some point- series 6) and then we'd be shaking our heads saying, ""Wow, you think they'd figure out by now that one does not simply kill the Doctor."" More suspension of belief and learning from past mistakes on the aliens' part.

The goal isn't connected to Amy, she was just the (failed) lure. Thus, her association isn't a plot hole, just iffy writing. The goal was to stop the Doctor from blowing up the universe via TARDIS. They failed in their goal, but lucky them, the Doctor brought the universe back anyways. So really, he saved all their butts after they stuck him in a box. Nice guys.

I think series 5 is pretty coherent and makes sense. It feels to me that you're really twisting yourself around here, I mean it all makes sense in my head at least. Again: suspension of belief. There are no true plot holes, just iffy writing (which is an opinion).

The only way all these villains are being out of character is if you don't believe the Doctor has built up a scary legacy. Just accept that. This isn't bad writing- in my opinion.

I remember there was someone who said the show Doctor Who itself didn't make sense. They couldn't get past the plot point of the Doctor being able to travel any spacetime because of the TARDIS.

You can't rely on outer explanations to solve in-canon problems. In-canon the Doctor is just as free-game as anyone else. Just as mortal.

If all of his enemies teaming together makes no sense (and it doesn't, really. Several of them would be of no use to the others anyhow) and them not killing him makes no sense (and it doesn't) then you should *not do those things*.

I mean it really is that simple. If you're writing and you stop and go ""wait, none of this makes any sense no matter what angle I come at it from"" then the solution really is to just re-write the thing to make sense.

And how is Amy a lure again? There's no connection to Amy, like *at all*. First glance. Romans, Big Box, Rory. Rory seems to have been an accident and the Doctor finding out that this had anything to do with Amy was, again, accidental. At what point was the Amy connection supposed to entice him? The enacted the plan to capture him *before* he figured out it was connected to Amy *at all*, so why would you connect it to Amy if you've done it in such a pointlessly vague and non-specific way that no one would notice unless it was explained to them?

Series Five makes sense (even if you ignore the changing nature of the cracks in time and the betrayal of everything that makes an Angel an Angel) *riiiiiight* up 'til the finale. In the finale, virtually *nothing* makes sense.

This isn't about not understanding something about the world or the technology. This is about *the characters*, the only important thing in any television show.

You can have every single law of physics broken, but if you have a character doing something that makes no sense and has no explanation then you've written a bad finale. You've broken the entire show. It's not real anymore.

The TARDIS, the regenerations, the aliens, the time travel, all things that are so unreal it's absolutely hilarious, but the Doctor, the Daleks, Amy, Rory, they're all supposed to feel like real characters. That's what sells it.

The Angels attack the Doctor...

  ***BEFORE***

... 2007.

Let me repeat that.

The Doctor travels into the past...

...and then the Angels attack him...

   ***BEFORE***

...2007.

Are you catching my drift now? Because you should understand that after they attack the Doctor ***BEFORE*** 2007, they go on and do exactly what you're describing. They attack people for years before they find the TARDIS and the key and Sally.

So, in conclusion...

...the Doctor...

...travels to the past...

...and gets attacked by the Angels...

...escaped from the pictures...

Slenderman is a creature of nightmares and shadows, the Silents are part of a shadowy organization.

I don't know, to be perfectly honest. Rarely does this subreddit receive posts or comments that require moderating, so everything is handled on a purely case by case level. The whole point of me starting this whole thing is mostly based in answering, where should that line be? So thank you for giving me some very well-thought out responses.

&gt; I don't know if this is the right mindset to be had on this matter. Many things (like cursing or off-colored jokes) can be found offensive to certain minorities, so how does one tip-toe around such matters? I guess it falls down to one's own ethics and judgment, and in this case, I did not feel that this would be offensive to anyone, or if it would, they had the option of not viewing it (as it is marked NSFW just in case).

You're right. Everyone can be offended by anything or everything these days, and I don't mean to make this place prudish. 

My background: I'm currently a student just finishing up a degree in Computer Science. Gender equality is a pretty hot topic in my day-to-day life because there's a fairly strong movement being undertaken to ensure women are in a comfortable environment at school and in the workplace and are treated fairly/equally. I think this is a carry-over of that, perhaps I'm being overly sensitive when this is a non-issue.

&gt; In this case, this is the first NSFW image I have posted on this subreddit (and maybe even all subreddits) and didn't think that it would be a big deal.

It probably feels like I'm singling you out, but I'm not really. This was the first NSFW post since the other that was reported, so I never had a need or chance to go on about it. Rest assured, it's nothing personal at all. It also highlights that it's not a big deal since it doesn't happen often, I'm just interested in forming what stance should be taken for the future, in the event that they do become more frequent.

&gt; I can easily refrain from posting things like this in the future, but, in all honesty, will feel that I am being ordered on what or what not to post, which is a feeling I don't enjoy much.

I'm not going to do that. I am mindful that there may be a quiet/silent group that do not like it, and will remain vigilant, like Batman.

&gt; I guess I just feel like that if something is disliked by the r/chelseafc community, it will get downvoted into oblivian, or removed completely by the mods (if it is clearly inappropriate: see gore/porn).

Correct, this place does a fantastic job at policing itself, which, as a mod, what I prefer and like to see.

&gt; I am not questioning your integrity, and feel you are an exceptional mod

Worries about the 'sex appeal' of the show can easily be satisfied with a piece of male eyecandy as companion (the role that the female companions have fulfilled for those who appreciate the female form).

A female Doctor wouldn't be any different from a male Doctor - she could be the fussy professor, gruff hardass with a heart (or two), lonely god, zaney vegetable wearer, wise crotchety grandmother, etc.  Whatever 'aspect' the Doctor takes next should work for a female Doctor as well as a male - because I'd hope that Doctor Who of all shows wouldn't subscribe to gendered restrictions.

All we'd need was a good actress and good writing, and the Doctor would break hearts anew, save the universe just as delightfully, and do anything any of the previous Doctors could do.

What would make me sick to my stomach, however, would be playing up the 'OMG it's a gurrrl!"" cliches - if the Doctor ever wore unsuitable footwear for running, complained about anything physical (unsupportive underwear, 'time of the month', hormones, opening a jar, omg boobs, etc.) or (god forbid) got pregnant - I would be UTTERLY disgusted in the writers.

We've both still got the X-Factor / American idol shite, and the UK watches enough of Two and a Half Men to make us just as dumb. I'd say Britain still tops America in comedy, but our dramas are sadly falling behind.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The Daleks could've forced them too. The Judoon et al might think ""Oh man even the xenophobic *Daleks* from the future are actually willing to work with us to defeat this Doctor guy. They must be serious. I'd heard of him but I didn't know he was *this* bad. And plus, they'll exterminate us if we don't help them. And just plain shooting this guy isn't going to work if he's survived all the things the Daleks say he has. Didn't work for us the first time around. So I guess we're part of the coalition now."" I mean that would be the logical course of action if the TT Daleks came down on you.

How could the Silurians join in? For all we know, the Daleks went and woke up a bunch of them (because at this point all their colonies still overslept) and forced them to join.

And you know what else? For all we know the Daleks brought all these other aliens, Judoon et al from the future. they could be future Judoon! They formed a coalition in the future, and the Daleks used their time travel tech to take the coalition to the past to stop the Doctor. They could've brought future Silurians who weren't happy with the Doctor and his ape friends (remember how angry Restac got).

Amy's a lure because the Pandorica and Romans are derived from her personal life/room/interests. They *did* intend for him to figure out it was connected to Amy (Duck pond? Not remembering the Daleks? Pandorica/Romans?) but it just failed. The Doctor definitely wondered why she couldn't remember the Daleks. I mean biggest hint of them all- what's up with the crack in Amy's wall? Oh look the crack is part of the cause of why a big coalition is out to get me and they're using Amy- that girl who had the crack in the wall. Amy is wrapped up in this. Because of the crack she's able to bring the Doctor back in Big Bang. Her life was eaten by the crack- she's definitely weaved into the plot.

I don't think the characters were out of character. The aliens did the logical thing- band together against the greatest threat in the universe. It's logical. Whether they were from the future or the past it doesn't matter.

&gt;The TARDIS, the regenerations, the aliens, the time travel, all things that are so unreal it's absolutely hilarious

Are you joking? It's not unreal to the point of hilarity. Time travel is possible, there IS an immortal animal on earth that can reverse/regenerate its cells to potentially live forever, and if we're here, aliens could be (though probably farther than the Whoniverse would suggest they are). The TARDIS is the most unreal, but that's because the writers have used it to do everything possible.

&gt;You fail at that, you fail at everything else.

Yes the characters are the most important thing but I think you're being melodramatic now. Your complaint is that the aliens are acting out of character. But if the Daleks came from the future (bringing threats or bringing aliens from their time) then it's all explained. 

You may ask why they didn't explicitly state this in the episode, but do we want to watch a minute of Amy and Rory hugging after she realizes who he is or do we want to watch a minute of the Doctor talking really fast to explain a plot point that can be thought out if anyone other than extreme fans cared that much. As much as we'd like the show to be for the fans and be plot/continuity airtight, it's just entertainment so they're not going to sacrifice time for plot explanation over emotion (one reason why series 6 urffed).",0,1333417541,null,0,false,0,c47te2g,t3_rpro3,t1_c47te2g,t1_c47rn6a,null,1428644044,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

But, the team is pretty much shite now. Their offense is dreadful at the moment and they haven't made any news about signing new players. I don't follow them so they might have big things planned for the draft but I don't think their front office is any good so they could be trying to get a bunch of Andy Carrolls to band-aid a bad situation.

I would suggest my team, the New York Giants, but since they just won the Super Bowl, you lot will be branded as glory hunters, or bandwagon fans as we call them. Even with a Super Bowl win, they're still underrated and not expected to do well next season. Giant victories come as surprises to commentators and are acknowledged through gritted teeth.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;There is something to be said about relieving pressure from players when they are being introduced into a side such as Liverpool. 

&gt; I wish it could have been different, that they were eased into the team...

I agree. I think this speaks to depth-issues at Liverpool as well. Other teams have suspensions and injuries as well but without the likes of Gerrard for a big chunk of the season, the Lucas injury and the Suarez suspension, we seemed a bit lost on the pitch. Pressure was put on the likes of Henderson, Carroll, Charlie Adam, Downing instead of relying on, say, Dirk Kuyt more or even Maxi or, hell, even Aurelio. Where has Aurelio been this season?

This is why I wish we did add a player or two in January, maybe not a superstar but at least a solid role-player. This is also why the summer transfer window, in my opinion, is huge. We need to continue adding players to the squad so we have more depth when/if injuries occur and to help ease in young players and players new to a massive club like Liverpool.",0,1333420033,null,0,false,0,c47txe3,t3_rpjxi,t1_c47txe3,t3_rpjxi,null,1428644296,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Why would Daleks, the creatures who make alliances with no one, decide to team up with everyone towards no goal other than a big, scary photoshoot as they usher the Doctor into the Pandorica? What could the Sycorax, the tribal skullheads of the universe, do for the Daleks? What could the slimy salesmen of the Slitheen do to help? The primitive Hoix? Why would they be needed? What possible use do they serve?

Well it's obvious. There's only one reason and that's to look cool, and that's like having no reason at all. It shatters suspension of disbelief. It makes you realize that this is just a show and that writers can do whatever they want with them.

They didn't erase the duck pond, or the memories of the Daleks, or any of that stuff. Those were the cracks. The cracks that the Coalition had no control over nor any real idea how to stop other than defeating the Doctor because they blame him for it.

You have literally no idea that they intended for him to find that clue. You're going on nothing. We have *literally* no evidence from inside the episode to support that, and in fact we have some events that suggest they never intended for the Doctor to make the connection at all.

Not logical. You brought the Hoix along! What's he gonna do? Growl at something? What are the Slitheen supposed to do? Hell, what are anyone standing there supposed to do other than explain things for the Doctor? Perhaps they all needed to join up and build the Pandorica, but did everyone need to all get together and shove the Doctor in (some of them not even doing that)?

Time travel hasn't been proven possible (although I preface with *yet*, there is this one faster-than-light-particle that seems promising), we've got no evidence of aliens, let along bipedal humanoid ones with lightbulbs and societies that mimic ours near perfectly, and the concept of someone becoming another person through emitting enough radiation to power a Sycoraxian fleet for years is positively impossible.

The only thing Doctor Who is about *are the characters*. There's really *nothing else*. Take away the characters from Doctor Who. See what you get. *Nothing*. 

Because Doctor Who isn't about planets and starships and the designs of robots. It isn't about theoretical physics or educating or architechture. It is and always has been about the people. Everything surrounding the people is unreal, totally unbelievable. But the *people*. They're real. They carry the show.

I'm not asking for new scenes explaining away all this mess, I'm saying don't cause this mess in the first place. There are clear reasons they did what they did. They used Amy's memories so they can bring back Rory. They formed an alliance so that they could have all the baddies in one room. They blew up the TARDIS so that they can explain the cracks. The issue is that *none of those things needed to happen*.

I *didn't* need to see every baddie in a room.

I *didn't* need to see Rory come back. (Especially since he comes back when they reboot the universe anyhow).

I *didn't* even need an explanation for the cracks. Sure, lead it up to the TARDIS, that's all fine and dandy. And seeing as you've freed up a massive amount of the finale's schedule, let's just go ahead and actually give a proper weight and gravitas to the situation, give a meaningful explanation to all this.

Let's take this freed space and *not* make easy escapes for the Doctor. Let's make things a little more complicated than ""paradoxically sonic my way out"". Let's be a little more creative than that.

*That's* what I want. Something that doesn't cop-out, that doesn't throw things in your face and expect you not to even think about it.

Dumbed down? No. different? A bit more cartoonish, dottering, buffoonish? Yes. That's not Smith, that's the writing and it's the direction they've chosen to take the Doctor in.

I'll agree that Smith's young, and a bit inexperienced at times. His big speech against the Coalition of Evil made him sound drunk and his Colonel Runaway Speech has this youthful grin/grimace that belies his youth. But overall he's done rather fantastic, being the main character to hold up a half-century long franchise and all.

Not every actor can crack a home run in their first season. We were incredibly lucky to get Eccleston and Tennant, both remarkably talented actors who managed to have brilliant first runs.

So far Smith's been great, but the Doctor must be *phenomenal*, and he's been slowly working towards that with age and experience at his back.

Most actors hit their stride three seasons in. It happened with TNG, it happened with so many others, and I can see it happening here.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Got a second opinion with a friend after I thought about your response more. I agree it's out of character (who needs the Slitheen?) and he agrees too. But he also agrees with me that this is a tv show for entertainment and that you need some more suspension of belief. Or just as my friend says- roll with it. He too also relies on the ""outside off-screen explanations"". Here:

""Well it's not a plot hole, as you say it's out of character, which are two different things. And frankly, I don't disagree with what he's saying, except he's overlooking one important point, and that is, yes...it is a television show. Again it's not watched just by fans - in fact fans make up less than 1% of the viewing audience. The general public like that sort of thing, so yes it is there to look cool. Occasionally things happen just because it's cool - The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, the Pandorica Alliance. It happens.

My suggestion is always just to roll with it. I mean, we are talking about a television programme which has fundamental flaws in its logic, let alone other aspects - you try solving the UNIT dating conundrum using all the available evidence and not overriding any of it. 

The fact is that I agree with a lot of what he said. Well some of it. I mean, seriously the inclusion of the Silurians makes no sense, and the Judoon apparently have no jurisdiction on Earth, which would suggest that the whole thing has been authorised by the Shadow Proclamation, which really makes no sense.

So, how do you reconcile it? Easy. It was all part of some larger scheme that we never really understood because whoever concoted it made one fundamental mistake - the Doctor simply wasn't responsible for the cracks in time. Once the reboot happened it was all immaterial.

The missing ducks and the mysterious third story in Amy's house have yet to be explained, but let's wait until Amy and Rory are gone before we go off at Moffat for that (don't get me wrong, I don't think it'll ever be explained, but you never know...)

The fact is that every television show at some point does something showy and it creates a bit of a cock up (for example, Star Trek had a wonderful rule of not being able to fire photon torpedoes when their shields were up, until they wanted to be showy and do it, and as a result screw over their own rules). It happens. We have to deal. It doesn't mean the programme is terrible, that it's a cop out ending (after all the same ending could have been achieved if it was just the Daleks, so it's not a cop out), or that Moffat's a bad writer. It just means the programme made a mistake. It happens. We're approaching series 7 so it was virtually two series ago. Worry about more important things, like how the Fendahl apparently destroyed Mars, and yet the Ice Warriors were still happily living on it later""

EDIT from my friend: Having said all that, I forgot to mention that your friend has sort of missed the point of the episode a little. Complaining about paradoxically escaping the Pandorica does both the writing and the episode a disservice. THe Doctor doesn't usually escape from situations like that, and yes it is a slight conceit, but it's a very clever conceit and there's no reason why it shouldn't work. What your friend is saying is ""I don't like time travel used that way, and therefore it shouldn't be"", which is not the way it works unfortunately. For every person who thinks that the paradox was a cheap and easy way to escape the situation, you have someone who says actually it was clever and witty. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it wrong, and that's the problem he has in this situation.

I'm having a discussion with someone about Rose at the moment, and she has all these reasons she hates Rose. When I countered every single one of them, she either disagrees or finds new reasons. But at the end of the day, what she is saying is ""I hate Rose. That makes her a bad companion,"" and sorry, but that doesn't hold water. Viewers likes and dislikes shouldn't dictate how Doctor Who is written (and when it does, you run into big problems). 

To say the only thing Doctor Who is about is the characters shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what Doctor Who is about. Verity Lambert, Barry Letts and Philip Hinchcliffe wouldn't agree - they thought it was about the stories. John Nathan-Turner, Graham Williams, Innes Lloyd and Peter Bryant thought it was about the monsters. Derrick Sherwin thought it should be a gritty, hard hitting military drama. The champion of characters - Russell T Davies - would still not say that's all Doctor Who is about, because he was a huge believer that monsters were a vital element of Doctor Who. And to the general public, the monsters are one of the most important aspects of Doctor Who, if not THE most important. So a room full of different monsters is hugely important to the general audience, and you can dismiss this and say that Doctor Who is selling out or it's pandering or whatever, but making Doctor Who something that only the ""real"" fans want will give you one result - cancellation. Doctor Who is about what the current showrunner believes it is, and at the moment the current showrunner believes it is a dark fairytale, twisted in time and caught up in the complex relationship between the Doctor and his team. That's what Doctor Who is now. It's not a series of adventures set in claustophobic locations with monsters trying to break in, or a duel between two aliens against the backdrop of a military organisation and the threats our own planet can create, or a love story across time and space as a lonely god is healed from the horrors of a war he was determined to run free from. That's what Doctor Who WAS. It's not what it IS. And it's never, never been all about the characters.

You ask, how can the Doctor get out of the Pandorica. In an aborted timeline, he gets out himself, gives the sonic to Rory who then gets the Doctor out.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Well the real question isn't ""What's you name?"" it's ""Who are you?"" that leave you open to *waaaaaay* more leg room to give a meaningful answer.

Just read your friends edit. He's quite clever, isn't he? Although I think he's not missed the point persay, but he's just looking in the wrong direction and to an extent misinterpreting what I have to say.

Alright, let's take this step-by-step. Easy does it.

First, I'm not saying ""I don't like time travel used that way"". I *loved* Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and they *exclusively* use this form of time travel. Further still, there are many other depictions of time travel that use this exact same situation all the time, and it doesn't bother me.

Small-scale, yes Big Bang used it in a witty way. Big-picture, however it topples over a few things.

The Doctor has always been adamant (and not ""time can't be rewritten"" naive and stubborn One, this is ""Time Lord Victorious"" Ten here) that he simply cannot go back into his own timestream. This means he can't just go back in time and save himself all the time, or else he would do that *all the time*.

And that's the point. Once you introduce this magic ""solve everything"" scenario, the Doctor looks like an idiot for not using it *all the time*. Trapped in a 20th Century Japanese imprisonment camp miles away from the TARDIS alone? Just pick yourself up and drop you back off at the proper TARDIS. Need backup? Another pair of hands? Just go back in time and do it yourself.

Doctor Who has specifically said that's not how they do things because if it was how they did things every episode would be an incomprehensible mess of going back in time to help yourself.

This has nothing to do with my preferences, but has everything to do with how it impacts the entire show as a whole.

And I think you're separating the Monsters from the characters, and while that may have been the case early on, it's certainly not the case now. Look at The God Complex, look at how the Silence and the Daleks and the Cybermen have been portrayed. They aren't just passive beasts, they're *characters*. They're just as much characters as the Doctor or his companion.

Some episodes don't even *have* monsters. And that's sort of the point of this new series. It's not all slaying beasties, it's about life and living it and having adventures.

And *that's* what RTD's message has been. It's been about a universe filled with diversity that humanity blends itself into. A world of tolerance and of total bizarrities being treated like character quirks, and there's the overall message: Live life and run with it.

Who says it's not about the characters? I've seen Doctor Who writers bail out from Star Trek because unlike Doctor Who, it didn't have real characters. It's *always* been about the Doctor and those he meets and travels with.

The conflict, the aliens, the space-travel and wonders of the future, are all just beautiful accompanyments to the core story: that of the Doctor himself and what he does as a character. This new series has done that more than any other iteration of the Doctor yet.

It *is* about the characters, because you tell me what Doctor Who is worth without them. Just take one look at Doctor Who with no characters.

It's not like Star Trek, where there's a government and a military and a series of spaceships to admire free of characters. There's nothing in Doctor Who *but* characters. It's always one real card of a character, a character who's got the personality of eleven men's worth in him at all times, meeting other real cards of characters and mixing into their lives, and changing them.

That's Doctor Who, or at least that's what it's core facet is. And in this age of doctor Who it's become only more strong and important.",0,1333427230,null,0,false,0,c47vcs1,t3_rpro3,t1_c47vcs1,t1_c47v3hl,null,1428644976,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,omgitsbigbear,null,null,"We're coming at it from very different places then. I hate the idea of things being frozen just because they're iconic. Doctor Who, with every new regeneration and companion, is continually reinventing itself. If a women is the best choice to play the twelfth or thirteenth Doctor then by all means let her play the Doctor. If, even though comparing a green TARDIS to a female Doctor is fatuous, a green TARDIS lets them take Doctor Who in a cool new direction, then paint that sucker green.

Some of the worst episodes of New Who have been the ones featuring old enemies. Yes Daleks are iconic. But with the kinds of things explored by Nine, Ten and Eleven they're simple, boring, and predictable. I love Daleks but if they never appear again I'd be fine with it. I can still watch *The Daleks*. The old icon will still exist, but new stories can be told without being chained to an outdated prop. 

Where you ask ""why would you change it?"" I ask ""why wouldn't you change it?"". Trying new things gave us *The Enemy Within* but it also gave us *The Doctor Dances* and *Blink*. Nothing new will ever erase the great things that came before it, but nothing new will ever be great if it isn't free to be make its own way. A green TARDIS won't invalidate *The Green Death* and if it lets something like *Midnight* happen then it's a risk I'm willing to take. If an actress can bring something as amazing to the character as Matt Smith's near effortless command over emotional shifts or David Tennant's absolutely iconic ""I'm so sorry"" then we're all worse off just because it's so much more in line with previous Doctors that she not be a girl.

In the mean time I'll see if my friend has a response.

I personally have to disagree that Doctor Who is *nothing* without characters. Characters are obviously integral to *any* story, I mean you can't have a story without characters to interact, but the characters in Doctor Who are no more essential to the show than the average show. And I do differentiate the characters from the monsters. Cybermen and Daleks have (or are supposed to have) no personalities, most aliens are just baddies of the week with no characterisation or are animals just following instinct. That's not character. They may be more sophisticated than primal beasts but they're not characters. Villains like the Master and Davros have character (radio dramas especially expand their characters). They have personal motivations. What's the Silence's motivation other than avoiding destruction like any living thing would want to do? What's the Daleks' motivation other than to destroy all non-Dalek life? The Cybermen just want to assimilate everything.

Also, whether you ""don't like time travel used that way"" or just 'don't like time travel used that way in the context of Doctor Who' it boils down to the same thing. Just because you dislike it does not mean it *should*  or *should not* be what Doctor Who is like. Like my friend says- if that happened, the show would go chaotic.

Plus, even if the Doctor *can* go back and fix everything like he did with the manipulator and screwdriver, it's still something you *shouldn't* do that is very risky. Look at the accident that happened in *Father's Day*. It wasn't such a big risk in a tiny universe like the Big Bang had, but in the normal full sized universe, you could accidently mess up so many things... best to do things the manual way.

I really can't say anything about RTD's message. Either we ask him what it was and what he thinks is the most integral part of the show, or we leave it up to personal interpretation.

true,Rivercast,troughton,Troughton,"It all depends on the writer.  
Unlike the new series, the classic stories were characterised by a large and varied number of writers writing each of the seasons' serials. Depending on precisely where you choose to look, it may in fact be time travel just to set a setting-- this is mostly seen in the historical series of the 60s-- or it may actually have a big influence on the plot. If the latter is what you're after, let me recommend a few serials:  
  
* The Chase (1st Doctor): More of a spacetime romp than anything, the gist of it is that the TARDIS crew are being chased by a Dalek fleet and have to travel back and forth through space and time to try and evade them, with the gap between them getting smaller with each trip. Still, some of the places they end up in are the Empire State Building, a haunted house, and the Mary Celeste, so I say it's worth checking out. 6 episodes long I believe it is.  
  
- Inferno (3rd Doctor): This is not time travel in a conventional sense, it's 'sideways' time travel (into an alternate universe) though the narrative does shift back and forth between that universe and regular Earth. It has a very intense plot to go along with this theme and stands at 7 episodes length.  
  
* Day of the Daleks (3rd Doctor): It's often cited as to where the plot of Terminator came from. The Doctor has to travel between the present and a Dalek-dominated future in order to try and figure out what triggered the war that spelled the end for humanity. Pretty tense, but not as much as Inferno. 4 episodes long I believe.  
  
* The Armageddon Factor (4th Doctor): This is actually the last story of the 'Key to Time' season arc, so look into that if you want to fully understand the plot. A big part of this serial is a time loop in which an order is given to destroy the planet the Doctor is in, which grows steadily thinner as the plot goes on. Then again, this turns out to be one of a heap of things that keep piling up until the finale comes about, so it takes some focus to give it the proper importance. Oh, 6 episode-long season finale.  
  
* Mawdryn Undead (5th Doctor): This one actually fits the bill very well, with the characters becoming separated into two different time periods in the same location, meeting their respective versions of the Brigadier. The two timelines eventually converge, resulting in a pretty satisfying ending. This one is 4 episodes long.",0,1333434314,null,0,false,0,c47wg6v,t3_rqt98,t1_c47wg6v,t3_rqt98,null,1428645484,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

We've shown with some of the bids we've made in the last two years that we're ready and able to invest the money if the right player comes along, it's just that those signings didn't work out and we didn't just go and panic buy an alternative. We've spent nothing in a couple of years now, so we're definitely still in a position to invest. I'd say there are quite a few potential 20-goal a season strikers within our price range, including the two you mention (though they wouldn't be at the top of my list).

In terms of other squad areas that need filling, CB is the only major one that compares to our need for a striker, and I'd say we're looking like good favourites to pick up Vertonghen for £10-15m. I'm confident we can afford that along with a £20-30m forward.

We have some £40-60m worth of senior players we'll be looking to move on this summer (Gomes, Bassong, Corluka, Jenas, Bentley, Pienaar, Dos Santos, maybe even Kranjcar and/or Defoe), who would between them knock more than a few hundred thousand off our weekly wage bill - those sales alone could potentially bring in enough to cover our two most vital pieces of business without us spending very much at all. I think we could add, say, Remy, Vertonghen, Adebayor and a winger (Hoilett/Drenthe/Moses/Zaha/Krasic might be good options who are available) for a net spend lower than £20m and very little increase to our already low total weekly wage bill. If all the talk of willingness to invest heavily this summer is true we could be talking about going even further, and then you're talking about going all out for a player like Hazard.

""COYS"" is for ""Come On You Spurs,"" a general chant you'll hear in the stands at home games.  ""Yid"" is a nickname that came to the club because the area of London the club is from, Tottenham, was a big Jewish neighborhood.  As I know it, other teams would mock Spurs fans as Yids so we took the name for our own.  Spurs fans are loud.  Man for man I think we're the loudest in England.  When the team goes to play away matches, you can frequently hear our one or two thousand fans stuffed in the corner singing louder than the whole stadium.

You nailed it on where the international teams are pulled from.  Every country picks its top players, even if the players make their money abroad playing for other clubs.  Most players over 23 who play for Spurs will have played on their national team at some point.  Whether they're likely to be picked now is all a matter of the national team coach's preferences and the current form of the player.

Right now each player on our whole first-choice starting lineup will be worth watching for one reason or another.

* Brad Friedel: He's an American goalkeeper, and at 40 he's a freak of nature. An amazing season for us.
* Ledley King: Ledley is the stuff of legends for us.  His right knee has no cartilage in it.  He works out on his own, he struggles through swelling and shows up on match day as a rock for us.  He is a legend.  Try to pick out Spurs fans singing for him during matches: ""[Oh Ledley Ledley, He's only got one knee!  He's better than John Terry!  Oh Ledley Ledley!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IpiFZNTEg)""
* William Gallas: Gallas is a former Chelsea and Ar*enal player and that meant controversy at first when he joined us.  Now he's a pretty solid defender and brings a lot of experience.  He is injury prone, and because of Ledley King's injuries, the two of them frequently rotate out for other players like Younes Kaboul or Ryan Nelsen.
* Kyle Walker: Walker is a young guy who has just this season made the team at right back as a full-time starter.  He sometimes shows his inexperience, but he is very quick and has become a reliable way to push the ball forward from the right side.
* Benoit Assou-Ekotto: Benny is the internet cult hero for Spurs.  His twitter [@assouekotto](http://www.twitter.com/assouekotto) is a comedy goldmine.  He is a really laid back player and seems not to feel pressure.  He's another guy who has developed over the last few years from a squad player into a full-time starter.
* Scott Parker: Parker is a [billionaire who plays football for fun](http://arlombardi.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/scott-parker-spurs-1011.jpg)(I kid).  He's what you'd call a ""ball winner"" in midfield, in that he's not there to score, he's there to get the ball back when we lose it.  In a way he plays like a linebacker if I'm making the NFL analogy; he's an all-purpose misery generator.
* Aaron Lennon: If Parker is a linebacker, Lennon is more like a wide receiver.  He is very quick, and his presence forces teams to account for the right side of our attack.  Otherwise, they'd all be leaning against our left side to cover...
* Gareth Bale: Bale is the most hyped player for Spurs right now.  He is a left sided player who has a ton of speed and strength to his game.  His passing is fantastic, and he occasionally makes cuts with the ball in on goal that can rip defenses apart.  On a great day he can win us games almost by himself.  On an off-day, he'll fire a bunch of shots off-target from long distance.
* Luka Modric: Luka is our team's catalyst and, again with the NFL analogy, our quarterback.  He is the distributor of the ball from the middle of the field.  When he has the ball, he's looking to set up the play.  If you're watching a match and you see the little man with long hair in control of the ball, you'll see a lot of ""off-the-ball movement"" as players try to give him an option.
* Rafael Van der Vaart: Rafa is our gateway in attack.  He does a bit of everything on the offensive end of the field.  Flexibility is the key for ""VdV;"" sometimes he'll be looking to shoot, other times to set up others.  He is a very creative player.
* Emmanuel Adebayor: Another former Ar*enal player, but he has won over most Spurs fans by working very hard and both scoring and assisting a bunch of goals this season.  He does a great job of ""holding up"" the ball, that is, receiving it in a forward position and then keeping control of it while he either makes something happen or while reinforcements arrive.  It's important to note that Adebayor is on ""loan,"" meaning another team owns his contract and, at the end of the season, we'll likely try to buy him from that team.  He is, though, criminally overpaid.

We don't do terrible towels, but we do have [sexy scarves](http://shop.tottenhamhotspur.com/category/scarves).

Yes, we are good.  Our last few years have been excellent, and the club is historically a very good club with awesome highs and the occasional deep low.  We haven't won the league in a long time, but the team has had a historical commitment to playing an attacking style.  That's in part where the Bill Nicholson quote comes from.  We don't fear other teams, even when we probably should.  Sometimes we get crushed, and other times we turn on the class.

Right now we're coming off of a two month dry spell where we played decently but couldn't get much going.  We were so good early in the season that our dry spell hasn't ruined our season, but it has hurt our pride some.  The goal for the rest of the season is to finish in 3rd place.  It sounds weird that we'd settle for 3rd, but realistically we're out of the hunt to win the league.  What we can do is secure entry into next season's [Champions League](http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/index.html).  Big name players want to play in the Champions League.  For us to keep our best guys and attract new ones, we have to qualify for it.  Both 3rd and 4th qualify, but 4th place means there's a potentially tricky playoff series against some team in Europe to get into the competition proper.  Finishing 3rd would put us above Ar*enal, our bitter local rivals, which would be the most excellent gravy atop a very strong season.

We're also in with a shot at the FA Cup.  Where the NFL holds an end of season tournament based on regular season seeding, most soccer nations have knockout tournaments that happen concurrently to the season.  It's more prestigious to win the league, but winning the FA Cup is a meaningful achievement.  We'll be playing Chelsea in the semifinals of that competition, and that will be a great match to watch live.

I will try to be brief, so you might have to Google anything that isn't clear. We have a long, fantastic, history, but for now I will stick to the last 35 odd years. 

First, the pain. Every Spurs fan knows it is a short fall from where we are [right now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp0ZUdopxjY). The 80s were some of the best for Spurs, with legends like Hoddle, Gascoigne, Archibald and [Villa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R44tPArJIy4) playing for us. These were swiftly followed by some of the [worst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X96DeMz3mfY). Throughout the 90s it we were regularly finishing 10th or below, even though we played [great football](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29GpwMo0yII). Some names that are legendary for a different reason would be Christian Gross, Ian Walker, Chris Armstrong. 

We are known for entertaining football, and players like [Klinsmann](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luHMIIM8Sys), [Ginola](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCTbNqBP9h8), [Gascoigne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVMaIUSeRxA), and more recently [Bale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZMjHzWXQc) et al, have made sure that pedigree continues. Indecently, Gareth Bale's career is a good allegory for Spurs' current fortunes. From 07-09 Bale played in 29 games without a win, he was like our anti-talisman. Then suddenly he became unbeatable, and so did we. This all contrasts to [Woolwich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSSlZd3nJqQ), who throughout the 90s became known for their boring football. If you want a taste for how sad the other side have it, just read Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch. 

Right now we have had about 3 years of great football, thanks to a turnaround with Harry Redknapp at the helm. He is known as a bit of a wheeler dealer, who snapped up Van der Vaart for a $7m bargain, but doesn't read emails, doesn't write and received a bung into his Monaco account, but had no idea about it. Thank Billy Nicholson we managed to keep hold of Bale and Modric when Chelski were offering stupid money (rumoured $40M for Modric), because they wouldn't leave now. 

We have some REALLY promising youngsters coming through. [Danny Rose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkXtIib5T1Y) and [Harry Kane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNF5rV6oqR8) just to name two off the top of my head. We also have a little bit of dead wood we would like to get rid of. In the new season, when we are playing Champions League football, Spurs will be looking to purchase a new top class defender (on account of Legend King's dikky knees) keep Adebeyor, on loan from Man City, or buy a new striker. Top of the list of rumoured targets are Loic Remy and Eden Hazzard, although I am sure there are plenty of others out there. 

A couple of other random things that I couldn't find a place for. [Stand Up For Martin Jol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYuUyaVH3BY).

Premier League - this is the main competition, 20 teams compete each year, playing against each other in a home and away round robin format, so 38 fixtures a season. We're currently 4th this season, with 7 fixtures left, level on points with our biggest rivals Arsenal. The bottom placed 3 teams at the end of the season are relegated to the league below - the Championship; they are replaced the following season by the highest ranking three Championship teams.

FA Cup - often noted as the world's most famous domestic cup competition, this is a knock out tournament all the way. Thousands of teams from across England (and Wales) enter in it's earliest stages. Premier League level teams enter in the Third Round. We have made it to the semi-finals this year, and will be playing Chelsea at Wembley (English national stadium, unaffiliated with any club, and so considered neutral ground) on April 15th. We have the third best record of FA Cup wins historically (8 wins), and were the first club to win the League and FA Cup in the same season back in the 60s. We haven't won it since 1991 though.

League Cup - a lesser version of the FA Cup, very similar knockout format, but only for professional teams from the Football League (Premier League and the three divisions below it: The Champoionship, League 1 and League 2). This is often not taken too seriously - the big teams, including us, often use this competition, in it's early stages at least, to give competitive experience to our young players in an environment where we're not too worried if they lose.

Continental (entrants from across Europe) competitions is what Euro refers two: the best finishing teams in each years' Premier League (same goes for all the other major leagues around Europe) qualify for one of the two European competitions held the next season

The Champions' League - the most prestigious of the two, and hosts the best teams from all of Europe's best leagues. We qualified for the first time for last years competition and rather unexpectedly made it to the quarter-finals. All the best players want to play in this competition and we're pretty desperate to get back - you can't sign the best players unless you can offer them regular CL entrance (you need to finish in the top four of the Premier League to qualify).

The Europa League - an almost identically formatted competition to the CL, just with lesser teams (5th place in PL qualifies, as does winner of each of the two domestic cup competitions). It's essentially the continental version of the League Cup to the CL's FA Cup.

The stats are listed seperately because of the varying prestigiousness of the competitions - scoring lots of goals is great, but considered less great if lots were scored in the League Cup instead of the Premier League.",0,1333445259,null,0,true,0,c47xf4a,t3_rqvtk,t1_c47xf4a,t1_c47xarc,null,1428645941,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

1. Not everyone who lives in a council property is a chav. You're coming across as a massive dickhead making statements like that.

Nobody stopped you from applying for a council flat and applying for the right to buy. Nobody forced you to take a mortgage that cost 'over a thousand a month'.

true,Birchman,null,null,"Depending on how successful the team is, usually they compete on 4 cups a year. The League, which is the league of 20 teams, you play each time twice, one home and then away making it 38 games which is a long tournament making victory all that bit sweeter for the winning team. Manchester United have now become the most successful side winning it 19 times, with Liverpool coming in at 18. We have only won it twice and have been runners up 4 times.

The FA Cup is the English cup if you will, very traditional cup where every team is invited to play and there are a lot of qualifying rounds where teams in the lowest of the leagues get a chance to play against the big guys if they do well. Often there are big big upsets with teams from the highest league losing against teams from maybe 5 or 6 leagues below simply because of the ""magic"" of the cup. It's a much sought after trophy and Spurs are in the Semi-Final this year, their best for a couple of years! The team who wins the cup, depending on how well they finish in the league, has an invitation to play in Europe.

The League cup (Or Carling Cup as it's called now) is the lesser of the cups, generally used by the larger teams to try out their young, up and coming players to get them games. This, like the FA Cup is a knockout competition, 8-9 rounds I think, the team winning progresses the losing team is out until next year. Again, like the FA Cup, a victory gives an automatic place into a European competition.

There are two remaining Cups technically, the Champions League (Used to be called the European Cup) and the Europa Cup (used to be called the UEFA Cup) which are both competitions involving other European teams. If you think of the Champions League being like the FA Cup, and the Europa Cup being like the League Cup (Carling Cup). If a team finishes either 1st, 2nd or 3rd in the league they automatically get a place in the Champions League. If you finish 4th, you are then put into qualifying rounds for the CL and the winning team then takes up the final place of a group when the competition starts. Spurs got into the CL for the first time in 2010 and we had an incredible year getting into the Quarter-Final against Real Madrid where Gareth Bale had his spotlight moment against Inter Milan with an absolutely outstanding performace against the then considered ""Best right back in the world"" Maicon; see [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp0ZUdopxjY) 

The Europa League is a gruelling competition, a team going from qualifying to the final could play 18 games, adding that to the 38 in the league and at least 1 game in either of the other cups and your team needs to be a pretty big to manage that kind of competition stay power. Fulham famously had an incredible run 2 years ago, qualifying in the earliest stages to get right to the final and only just lost to Athletico Madrid. It's been seen as a bit of a non-tournament with teams not really wanting to play, travel all over Europe to play small teams for a competition that doesn't warrant much success. Spurs played in this tournament this year and really didn't take it seriously, didn't qualify from the group stage to the knockout stage unfortunately but it was close. The great thing about both European tournaments is that teams from different countries play completely different styles of Football at times which makes it so exciting. Manchester United just got knocked out by the Athletic Bilbao who currently lie 7th in their league, it just goes to show how incredibly varied it can be.

* Authoritarian shift with ID cards and countless other things the coalition explicitly promised to avoid because it was quite an issue by the end
* Huge moves to privatise and uses of PFIs are arguably at odds with democratising the economy at grass roots levels.

One stance of Socialism is that liberal economics lead to a ruling class who establish control of the wealth under the guise that there is more freedom in allowing them to do so. Doing so in a way that is compatible with keeping some aspects of a free market is one thing, but outright privatisation without social control is another.

For most historians, Democratic Socialism is generally used to contrast against the idea of Revolutionary Socialism in that Socialist ideals are brought about within a democratic society. This is the overview given on Wikipedia as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism

Perhaps it could be argued they've moved more into being Market socialists economically, but we could argue definitions all day on that.

The question really shouldn't be why he gets so much playing time, he doesn't. The question should be why does he constantly get benched and dropped even when it looks like he could put together a good run of games. Carroll is a young, developing talent but he never gets a run of more than 1 or 2 games before he is dropped, no matter how well he plays.

EDIT: All right, found the stats. Our record in our last 6 games in which Carroll didn't start: D L L L L L. Our last 6 in which he did start: D W D W W L. And the last time Suárez got a goal or an assist while Carroll wasn't playing was 10th December.

For whatever reason, the team plays better with Carroll in the side, and yet he is constantly dropped, often after a good performance.

The housing situation in this country is a disgrace - largely due to the idea of selling off the council homes in the first place. I believe that the government should have rented the homes at a slight profit whilst providing homes for those with no alternative, and used the money to purchase abandoned homes/brownfield areas/build new homes and done the same there etc. thus ensuring a good supply of affordable housing for the whole population.

But due to the fetish of ownership and the stigma of the state being involved in anything - both of which are not rational arguments but purely ideological concerns we instead just sold them off. This created a housing crisis which allows landlords to set extortionate rents and therefore the buy to let regime caused house prices and thus mortgages to soar.

I don't understand the mindset that just because I'm being screwed over, I have to ensure that everyone 'beneath' me suffers even more - it seems to be present in every debate from Unions striking for better conditions to housing.

What is my assumption? That you were directing anger at council tenants? It's not an assumption, it's a clear fact to anyone reading your initial post.

Not sure what this has to do with my question? A couple of corrections to your misinformed mindset though; anyone living in a council property for 'free' would not be eligible for the RTB scheme. Working council tenants generally have to pay rent. Only working council tenants would be given a mortgage to pay off the remaining value.

&gt;It completely fucks the property market for everyone when the price of every house is adjusted against the expectation that a ""bottom rung"" non-council property can sell for ""what poor people can afford, plus 75k"" to compete with right-to-buy houses.

No, what fucks the market are buy to let landlords and shitty housbuilding policy from central government. Do you have any evidence for your statement? You are aware that RTB homes are valued as any other house would be? By a couple of independent valuators?

Yes, personally I think it is being done to please the Tories donors in the private healthcare industry.

No one knows how much money the tax has brought in. The Tories were so keen to cut the tax that they haven't waited until the tax had even been in place for a full year, so their justification for cutting it is based on estimates. If it is so easy to avoid why would people leave the country? Of course a tax is going to be easy to avoid if it only lasts for two years, people can just get paid in advance the year before and defer their earnings the next year until after the tax is dropped.

So the Government needs to show it is improving literacy year-on-year, so it flows down targets to schools. Schools which don't obtain the targets are faced with 'fines' (budget cuts), so the school board insists that the teachers ensure students pass tests. The teachers, faced with increasing pressure and fewer resources, gradually shift their teaching styles to the ones that make the numbers look good; they find ways of getting kids to pass tests. *""He's failed 29 times?

true,[deleted],null,null,"No I can't agree with this.  I think genuine research is something to be conducted by people who are slightly older, and more comfortable in their field.  I know that if it was expected of me to go off and research my own work as a 17 year old boy, I would have decided academia is no way suited to me (not so much due to lack of interest, but more lack of confidence) - which would have been a shame, as I am currently 26 and in my last term of my Masters degree.  

 It turns out academia was for me after all - I just wasn't ready for it till I was around 21 (and lucky enough to find the subject that peaked my interest).  If I had decided as a boy to go and work, there really would have been no option for me to change (realistically). 

 I think you're right to say it wasn't entirely useless though.  Of course - there has to be *something* to gain from two years of education.  

 I suppose it comes down to this;  If the subjects are taught from the beginning in the way they are ultimately conducted at the top level, then kids will have a fighting chance of discovering things that are actually interesting to them - as oppose to looking at all manner of subjects though the ""lens"" of the A-level format - which as far as I remember made everything look - basically the same (i.e. rather boring/**target driven**). 

 I still feel lucky to this day for discovering an academic subject that ignited my genuine interest.  And I found it on my 'second attempt' at college (after giving up and basically failing AS levels).  Funnily enough that was *after* I had basically given up on academia in general, and decided I was actually just going to 'do what I want', as oppose to what was expected of someone who is 'clever' - that I actually found something that I liked, and was good at.

---

I guess I'll talk a bit about the international duties that I don't think has been covered as much in the previous posts (sorry if I missed someone's massive post about it).

The **international duties** are, I'd say, very similar to those in ice-hockey. You play for a club anywhere in the world, but you're originally from (or ""assimilate""/move/get citizenship) a nation and thus you can play for their national team.

One interesting thing to note is that the Spanish and English national teams are highly consistent of players from the **Spanish/English leagues**, respectively. This is because the Spanish and English league has such high standards that the players stay in their native country. To compare we can take a look at **Holland**. Holland is a very good nation at producing young talent - talent which are picked up by other big leagues than Holland's Eerevisione (their top division, uncertain spelling). Thus you see a lot of top Holland players in the big European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, etc.). To mention 

Regarding the competitions. Basically, the **World Cup** is the biggest one, and is played every 4th year. Then we have the **European Championship** which is also played every 4th year, but 2 years before/after the World Cup - the latest World Cup was 2010, and this year (2012) it's the Euros. The Euros are a highly regarded tournament here in Europe, it is like the World Cup Light, and I guess it's because we have so many top European teams. The **Olympics** football are, I'd say, worthless (except women's football). This is because England/Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland aren't allowed to play in the Olympics, because they compete as United Kingdom in every other Olympic game - *until this year*. Now, not without argument and opposition from the various football associations, there will be an United Kingdom football team consisting of players from England and Wales (I think Scotland and Northern Ireland banned their players from participating). So I'm hoping that we get to see Bale in that team (since Wales didn't make the play-offs to the Euros), and maybe some English stars that didn't make the cut to the Euros. The **other** (Asian, African, etc.) championships are usually ""forgotten"" and uninteresting when it comes to us Europeans.

**Spurs**, we have a lot of internationals I'd say. For instance three out of the Croatian first eleven are Spurs players (Modric, Kranjcar, Corluka). We have also in recent years supplied the English national team foremost with attacking options (Lennon, Defoe, Crouch) but today we only get to see Parker and Walker regularly, with Defoe on the bench.

I was planning on making a list, but I feel like I will forget a lot of players, so I'll just mark down those I can think of (in a list form, ironically):

* **England** - Parker, Walker, Defoe, Lennon (usually overlooked), Dawson (overlooked), King (never fit)
* **Croatia** - Modric, Kranjcar, Corluka (on loan at Bayer Leverkusen)
* **Holland** - Van der Vaart
* **France** - Kaboul, Saha (don't think he plays much)
* **Wales** - Bale (their biggest superstar)
* ~~**Australia**~~ **Kiwi** - Nelsen
* **Mexico** - Giovani dos Santos (one of the best Mexican players, sadly he can't perform as well in Spurs)
* **Brazil** - Sandro
* **Cameroon** - Assou-Ekotto, Bassong (on loan at Wolverhampton)
* **South Africa** - Khumalo (on our bench), Pienaar (on loan at Everton)
* **Togo** - Adebayor (on loan at us from Manchester City)
* **USA** - Friedel (retired)

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Yes, personally I think it is being done to please the Tories donors in the private healthcare industry.

That's a side-benefit, not a 'why', unless that's all the justification you're looking for.

&gt;and this will only really start to happen in the long term anyway e.g. after the deficit has already been reduced.

Personally I think that there isn't enough long-term planning. Private or public, short-term fixes that save money now only to cost more tomorrow rarely lead to good things.

&gt;The Tories were so keen to cut the tax that they haven't waited until the tax had even been in place for a full year, so their justification for cutting it is based on estimates.

Considering the majority of high-earners are going to paying themselves via their own companies, I'm not sure why you'd need to wait a year to confirm this - this is what people were pointing out when Labour introduced the tax, and why it was rightly seen as showboating rather than a serious attempt at raising revenue because people do this *anyway*, 50% rate or no.

&gt;If it is so easy to avoid why would people leave the country? 

Because back then, it was applied personally so that limited company or no, you had to pay it. It backfired so badly that they won't try it again.

&gt;Of course a tax is going to be easy to avoid if it only lasts for two years, people can just get paid in advance the year before and defer their earnings the next year until after the tax is dropped. No need for avoidance schemes or leaving the country, the government has already made it as easy as possible to get out of paying.

You don't seem to be aware of how tax and companies work - if I earn my crust through a limited company, I have multiple options as to how I can buy what I was going to buy anyway without having to declare it as icome - by doing it through a company (asserting that I'm buying it on the company's behalf instead of my own), I don't have to declare it as a dividend and ultimately don't get taxed on it personally. My income (on paper) stays down, and I don't creep into the higher rate of tax.",0,1333456874,null,0,false,0,c47y7dv,t3_rq5tm,t1_c47y7dv,t1_c47y288,null,1428646394,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

A-level Physics is probably one of the biggest piles of rubbish there is. Mathematics (and especially calculus) is the foundation of physics and what I spend 90% of my degree doing.

So as a result, Physics A-level is nothing but a pile of qualitative shit that does very little to prepare you for the real physics done at university.

Johnson----Skrtel----Agger----Enrique

------Lucas----Shelvey/Hendo---

Obviously Stevie and Suarez could float around between the lines a bit and interchange. And this is with everyone fit.

I don't think Carroll is going anywhere, even if we do get another striker. I have no idea who we may go for to be honest, we're still without Champions League football to attract the big stars.

I have serious doubts that we live in a democracy. Sure, we might live in what is more or less a formal/legal liberal democracy, but quite clearly that it isn't sufficient for anything that is worthy of that title. There are mountains of anecdotal evidence that suggest legal freedom does not equal human freedom. For example, compare the USA and the UK. In the UK, the archbishop sits in the House of Lords, and we have a religious monarchy - there is no legal separation of church and state. However, religion has little or no say in politics here. By contrast, America has formal separation of church and state, yet  their politics is rife with religious rhetoric, and religion most certainly has a stronger influence than here. So given this, why do we have so much confidence that a formal/legal structure can actually achieve it's aim?

They are facts about public perceptions that you denied - which is game set and match to me on that matter. Now, on to the other claims you're making.

&gt; For example - you don't remember the ultimate lack of income from this tax being pointed out back when Labour introduced it?

I remember that being claimed at the time, yes.

&gt; You don't remember it being demonstrated that anyone working for their own company can easily avoid this? (Something that's actually common knowledge - people do it anyway, 50% rate or no).

Again, this kind of avoidance mechanism is well known, and - oops - you've just blown apart your own argument by pointing out there's no reason to suppose the 50% (as opposed to 45%) rate would significantly change people's exploiting it.

&gt; You don't remember the general discussions about why we can't just 'tax the rich' because of what happened when we tried that last time?

This claim is vague enough to be ignored. Which last time did you mean to refer to?

&gt; In this case it's rational to revise your beliefs and provide some real evidence.

Dude, everything you've just claimed were things that were discussed at the time in an evidence free zone. The basic point here is that **we have fuck all evidence** on the effect of the 50% rates, as they were not around long enough, and data hasn't been gathered in time, for us to assess.

You can read the IFS's report on the same thing here:

http://www.ifs.org.uk/projects/375

Despite this lack of decent evidence, you're still going on making substantive claims about the effect on government income, and so the burden of proof is *firmly* on you to provide evidence. So at this stage it's fair to regard your claims with the same credance one would ascribe to hot air. Once you've provided the empirical backup please be sure to let the IFS know too so they can update their discussion to incorporate your words of wisdom.

I saw your comment on the BBC news (Quoted from the Sun newspaper) that """"ordinary people"" would have nothing to fear"""". This is the same sort of logic that the Chinese government uses when beating protesters, or blocking access to social media sites. 

I like to think of myself as an ordinary person; a computer science student. However, if the government were to say they were going to set up cameras inside my flat, to catch any thief that *might* break in, or in case I *might* be a terrorist, I would be outraged - and I'm sure you and any other person in the UK would be too. (And nor would I put up with it). The same applies to the internet. There is nothing wrong with the current system of requesting a warrant from a magistrate, and then doing the dirty work. 

If you have the time, I would quite like to hear an explanation from someone who understands what is going on - you - about why this will actually help prevent terrorism et al; I simply can't see it working. Especially seen as without this measure, there has only been 52 deaths relating to terrorism in the last 7 years. There was 156,090 deaths from cancer in 2009 alone. This also doesn't answer the question of feasibility and cost (Which by my own calculations, would be in the hundreds of millions to billions)

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;They are facts about public perceptions that you denied

No, they are not. A newspaper conducting a poll = public perception? Please. You can relist the anger that the tabloids have created in order to sell more copies some more if you like, but that isn't the same thing.

&gt;and - oops - you've just blown apart your own argument 

Errr....if you say so. I've pointed out that people were avoiding it before it existed, and will continue to do so after it's gone, making its' existence pointless. Do illustrate how this is self-defeating.

&gt;This claim is vague enough to be ignored.

I'd calm down on this front - so far you've been so keen on congratulating yourself you haven't followed what I was talking about, and it shows.

&gt;Which last time did you mean to refer to?

Well, let me think, when did we last try to tax the rich? [Look at these dates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exile#Famous_tax_exiles) and you'll figure it out. *That's* why trying to increase personal taxation of the rich is a non-starter - they leave. Famously.

&gt;Dude, everything you've just claimed were things that were discussed at the time in an evidence free zone

You're now suggesting that being able to demonstrate how people can easily avoid a tax *before you even introduce it* 'doesn't count as evidence'. Righto.

&gt;The basic point here is that we have fuck all evidence on the effect of the 50% rates, as they were not around long enough

Not true, as already demonstrated - they already knew what the outcome would be and why the tax was ultimately irrelevant. Unless you have clear evidence as to why this isn't the case instead of newspapers polls centred around their own reporting.

&gt;You can read the IFS's report on the same thing here:

Read it, did you?

""Experience from reforms to higher rates of tax in other countries suggests that most of the behavioural response to the 50p rate will take the form of increased (legal) tax avoidance.""

It then goes on to mention how the effect of the 50% tax rate is unknown, partly because they don't know what avoidance levels would be attained. Really, we're going to assume that given several legal-and-above-board options, people *might not* avoid paying? Righto, that'll be a first. They then describe how the top 1% now contribute more (and get more back) than they did in 1979 - and go on to detail how the 1% might (= do) avoid paying the 50%, and how it could be ultimately self-defeating in terms of revenue if they were forced to.

&gt;Despite this lack of decent evidence

There's plenty. I've already listed some of the tent-poles, and they're mentioned in your linked doc as well.

&gt;you're still going on making substantive claims about the effect on government income

Not just me. You seem to think this is a recent development.

&gt;and so the burden of proof is firmly on you to provide evidence.

I already have. You've provided opinion polls and a document that (from the part I read) appears to reiterate what I've been saying.

&gt;So at this stage it's fair to regard your claims with the same credance one would ascribe to hot air.

Strangely backed up by the doc you've linked to. Maybe it's time to start actually providing evidence to back up *your* claims instead of mine. So far, you're down to 'we don't know' when I (and your doc) have illustrated why that doesn't matter.

&gt;Once you've provided the empirical backup please be sure to let the IFS know too so they can update their discussion to incorporate your words of wisdom.

You mean you haven't already let them know what their conclusions and recommendations will be in advance? Maybe you should provide more tabloid opinion-polls as evidence, or even links that back up the claims you're criticising - oh, too late.",0,1333461976,null,0,true,0,c47yxdt,t3_rq5tm,t1_c47yxdt,t1_c47yfry,null,1428646737,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But, yes, there is some difficulty there - although you could work intent into the law (that you are using an encrypted connection with another computer for the purpose of accessing the internet, or for the purpose of defeating government-sanctioned snooping) it is almost impossible, at a technological level, to differentiate between something like an SSH connection to a server, and an SSH tunnel that uses that server to connect to external sites.

The only way for the government and ISPs to see what was going on would be to 'break' encryption through Man-In-The-Middle attacks on SSL, SSH and other key-pair encryption. SSL could be broken in this way if the government set up a mandatory Certificate Authority -that was accepted by browsers- to sign certificates that were part of the man-in-the-middle attack (I believe China does this to some extent), which would stop the cert errors in browsers.

For SSH &amp; others, if the keys were set up outside of the snooping system (by physical access to your server and desktop) then you would be alerted to any potential man-in-the-middle breach.

For that reason, they would probably have to just prevent encrypted connections of that kind entirely, which would bring many companies to a halt.",0,1333464008,null,0,false,0,c47zasr,t3_rqzoy,t1_c47zasr,t1_c47z51i,null,1428646927,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Add that to the shaky confidence you can get from a pile of great chances hitting post, and you can see where that could justify a small dip in the form of a young player like him. Let's use him against Benfica tomorrow and give him a rest on the weekend; and I think you'll see him come right back to his top form.

My claim is this:

* We don't know whether the reduction for the top rate from 50% to 45% will have a positive or negative effect on government income (and what the magnitude of the effect will be).

This is backed up by the IFS report.

In response you're making some claims about avoidance and people leaving (which you've sought to evidence by reference such important demographic shifts as *Ronnie Corbett* leaving the country in 1979!). Such claims are *irrelevant* unless you can connect them to an overall reduction in government income, which you've failed to do.

Seriously, that's the level of the debate here - I say 'there's no evidence, because the cut occurred to early to measure the effect [at the end of the tax year for the first year it came in], and here's the IFS saying much the same'.

I could say 'I hate the Tories, they want to bring back fox hunting' (for example) - but that's reducing their entire manifesto to a single issue. And revelling in ignorance in order to sustain your opinions of people is almost the definition of bigotry.

Examples;

* One man may think that paying an increased amount of tax is fair, and so will vote for A.

* Another man may, through no personal fault, be unable to afford the increased tax and vote for B.

Using your logic, you won't talk to the second man because you're only interested in what he voted, not why.

It's the same as saying 'I wouldn't talk to anyone who watches tripe like Eastenders', and then not talking to someone who fits that description - if their reason is because they watch it with their elderly parents, not for their own purposes, then the situation is totally different....but you'd never find that out, having asserted that you're not talking to them.

This is why dialogue, even if it's with someone who has made choices you don't agree with, is so important. I'll talk to racists, homophobes, anyone - because it's *always* good to hear people's reasoning, and as a side-benefit you may be able to bring them round. I don't agree with people voting BNP, for instance, but put into context (the people voting that way are in sink-estates, for example) we can then work on why these people are so disaffected and why they feel abandonded. Sure, you can just say to them 'you're wrong', but that's the same as saying to teenage mums in Croydon 'you should have used a condom' - fine for Jeremy Kyle, not much use in the real world.

&gt; There will be no centralised policy list. Instead, candidates in each constituency will have policies that are determined by popular vote within that constituency.

Hello to ""Party X infighting escalates"" headlines in the newspapers. Parties require a centralised office setting policy otherwise you don't have a party. The general public, rightly or not, also expect parties to have cohesive policies that fit a pattern and can be understood at a glance.

Direct democracy has long been seen as a swift return to tyranny by the majority - which despite what the Guardian might want you to think, is a socially conservative UK that would bring back hanging and ban immigration tomorrow if it could.

&gt; No candidate will be permitted to debate within parliament. All debating will be done online or within the community. The candidate is a true public servant; their opinions are not to be aired in public.

Impossible to police and pointless anyway - politicians need the oxygen of publicity to explain to the masses what they are up to. Why abolish the electorate's right to hear what their elected officials think?

&gt; Each candidate can be forced to resign if the community wishes it.

Maybe, but you are also abolishing long-term thinking and forcing politicians to be in a perpetual state of election campaigning. That's a very bad thing to have. Maybe a right of recall in extreme conditions, but not because the electorate are a bit miffed about how the local primary school used yellow instead of white paint on the new building.

 again, I would disagree.  This assumes at some point students *did* have a sense of what is recreational etc...  
 okok, I would agree this problem does seem to be slightly more complex than more people=more problems.  But I think once you start looking at the bigger picture, what becomes totally unimportant is the zoomed in effect on the everyday that is expressed through drug use.  It simply does not boil down to 'people not knowing about drugs'.  Personally, I think it does boil down to much more deep-seated problems such as detached morality and therefore alien system of law, social/spiritual nihilism, extreme consolidation and centralisation of money at the expense of propagating ignorance on very important issues such as history, drugs, virtue and honour.... I could go on - but as you see, I think as soon as you start looking at the 'bigger picture', drug use of a small section of a bored populace starts looking like less of an illness, and more of a symptom.    

To add a bit of context; I have taken many of these 'harmful substances' (whatever that means) - I never lost sight of why I was doing it - I always came away with something to show for it - and I came out the other side, I believe, a better man.

Yes, repeat the sentence from the beginning that you need and ignore the rest that also addresses the same issue, it'll just go away.

Then you go on to declare that the Tax Exiles of the 70's and the story behind them are/ is now a 'claim'. Fantastic.

&gt;Such claims are irrelevant unless you can connect them to an overall reduction in government income, which you've failed to do.

Oh dear, you're not going to suggest that the whole Exiles fiasco having a negative effect on income is actually now a claim and not history? Michael Caine, Pink Floyd, many famous people left - and they were representantive of the behaviour of *rich people generally*. Seriously, do some more catch-up reading before deciding history is a 'claim' simply because you didn't know about it.

&gt;I say 'there's no evidence, because the cut occurred to early to measure the effect [at the end of the tax year for the first year it came in], and here's the IFS saying much the same'. 

And I reply with the same report which then list several of the reasons I'd already stated and some that I hadn't, which all follows on from the statement you quoted - so that's two seperate sources (me and the report) that both illustrate how not knowing the long term outcome of a temporary tax law doesn't really make any difference. If you're not going to address the parts that don't agree with your conclusion, better find another report that does - but don't hold your breath while doing so.

&gt;You've responded by saying 'but here's a list of people such as Noel Coward, David Bowie and Rod Stewart leaving the country at various dates in the second half of the 20th cent.).

No, that was to illustrate that 'taxing the rich' generally doesn't work, as has been evidenced before. And now you're using seperate quotes to justify different assertions - odd considering you're so sure of them despite apparently not knowing even the tax history of the last forty years.

&gt;I honestly don't know where to go with that....

Why not address some of the points you've avoided at least twice? The fact that you're doing it to the report you think counts as evidence speaks volumes.

&gt;If you want to try to refocus debate, you'll need to provide some evidence relating to the claim I've nicely spelt out and bullet pointed for you above. 

You haven't provided any. You've repeated the statement at the beginning of that section of the report (adding a bullet point to it changes nothing), and have then ignored the subsequent parts that come after it that I posted in response (that just happened to tally with what I'd been saying anyway - how about that), and now seem to think that the Tax Exile nonsense in the 70's is a 'claim'.

&gt;You've also confused a newspaper poll with an ICM newspaper instructed poll

I'm not sure it makes any difference. If The Sun decides to have a campaign against mugging, do you think a poll a few days later won't reflect this?
