There is a real thing, which is often called hypnosis, which is a sort of guided meditation. Entering this sort of ""trance"" does result in repeatable changes in test scores taken afterwards. There is absolutely no change in suggestibility (hence why the use of hypnosis to quit smoking never caught on), no loss of consciousness, and no memory loss. Real hypnosis is like a good massage.

2 - i didn't like how the game was approached, namely that we were playing our starting 11vyoungsters. i think di matteo got the subs slightly wrong. i understand we want to win as much as possible, but when we went down and put on essentially what will be out starting line up saturday. its a bit frustrating seeing fergie subbing on youngsters/fringe players and we were putting on oscar, hazard and ramires. ramires, fine, mikel had a yellow and looked primed for a second (i thought romeu reigned it in a bit after being rather reckless). i would have rather see what marin can do, and lose, than throw hazard on (although he looked really lively). thats what cup games, specifically the league cup is for.

3 - moses looked great, i'm sure not scoring was 99% down to cobwebs etc. but sturridge offered nothing that torres couldn't have and to me proved nothing to suggest he should be #1. we'll see this weekend, but his movement was clumsy at times and he is as selfish as ever. you want a bit of that in a striker but fuck me its like he gets tunnel vision. he'll give a better account of himself against swansea. he did look great on the break.

4 - piazon genuinely looks like he needs maybe 6 months - a year on loan and he'd be right up there challenging for spots with marin, who was unlucky to not have come on for lucas. ",0,1351728767,null,0,false,0,c6ulu43,t3_12f9ow,t1_c6ulu43,t3_12f9ow,null,1430288703,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,okochaflick,IT,italy,"Sturridge has more confidence in front of goal than any other player on the planet, so much so that it severely inhibits his talent. To be blunt, he was awful tonight. He was static throughout most of the game and kept defenders positioned in the middle preventing any secondary runs; Mata and Oscar were clearly annoyed by the lack of available movement. Sturridge has incredible talent but is far from having the mind of the striker we need and the excuse that he is young is getting old, he has had plenty of 1st team action at Bolton and under AVB to learn simple things like squaring it to a completely open man in his vision rather than try to score a 175degree shot. Torres is not the striker we need because of his lack of confidence and Sturridge is not because he is just dumb with the ball. I felt we were lucky today and the positive I got out of Sturridges play was that he might give Torres more confidence in his secure role.

On a more positive note, Piazon looked decent even though he failed to really make an impact on the game. Moses was unstoppable and made Buttner look like a schoolboy. Cahill is a machine that cannot be stopped. Our fullback situation on either side looks amazing with solid performances from Bertrand and Azpi.

The team showed great spirit and determination and kept right at it until the end. That's a lot more than most other teams can say.

But, I think we have to keep in mind that United today fielded a lot of young reserve players. Fresh legs who barely have any experience. Sure we had on some youngsters and non starting XI players as well. But when comparing the two squads, United definitely had ""lesser"" players on the field. 

Chelsea created a lot of chances, but the finishing was pretty poor. I remember seeing a stat at one point on screen saying we had 21 shots compared to United's 12. That right there should be indication that we need to up our finishing game.

Now I don't want to take away from that victory. It was a great game to watch and I am beyond happy we got the win—especially considering the travesty that occurred last weekend. But we shouldn't start bragging just yet. There are holes that need patching up.

Ratings: 

**Cech: 6.5**-First 2 goals weren't his fault and the third was well worked from United. You could argue that if he didn't come out to challenge Nani but whatever. 
**
Bertrand: 7.5**-When you don't hear the announcer say a players name too much it's because they are playing well. Ryan played great; I don't remember him making any mistakes. 

**Luiz: 5.7**-Not many people on here agree with me but I don't rate him as a CB and he proved my point again today. United's second goal was 100% his fault for going forward and losing the ball and he was caught out of position for there 3rd. He took the first penalty for Chelsea and scored it well. Also had a cracking free-kick go off the crossbar. He is a technically gifted player, no doubt, but the mistakes he makes are so simple to avoid.  


**Cahill: 7.6**-Played great as always, scored another wonderful headed goal and worked his ass off all game. Not much else to say. 

**Azpilicueta: 7**-Got up and down the right wing quickly throughout the whole game. He had some good hit crosses and some bad. Did well coming in from behind and tackling but United's last penalty was his fault for a weird rugby like tackle.

**Romeu &amp; Mikel: 6.8**-Mikel was doing most of Romeu's work in the first half and they both were diving in to tackles all over the pitch resulting in 2 early yellow cards. Mikel came off for Ramires at the half and Romeu for Oscar at 72'

**Ramires: 8.5**-He really is an outstanding player. Works hard and always gives a solid performance. He was a key in transitioning the counter late into the second half and ET. He took his goal well by rounding the keeper after a brilliant run by Hazard.

**Oscar: 8.3**-This kid's a star. He controls the tempo of the midfield, drifts past players with ease and isn't afraid to dive into a challenge. He was vital for the comeback and connected well with Mata and Hazard like always. 


**Moses: 8.1**-Easily his best performance in a Chelsea shirt. Bossed the RW and owned Buttner in the first half. He was unlucky not to score on multiple occasions and didn't help himself by missing a sitter from a cross. I like how him and Sturridge connected though; much better than when Torres and Moses have played together. 

**Mata: 9**-All he really did today was give us more of a reason to love him. I didn't expect him to start but he put in another terrific display of passing, dribbling and crossing. He sent in the corner for Cahills goal and got another assist. That's 7 goals and 7 assists for Juan Mata in his last 8 games. He is on top form right now.

**Hazard: 8.5**-He was a game-changer when he came on in the 55' for Lucas Piazon. He calmly scored the penalty won by Ramires before the end of normal time and didn't hesitate to [celebrate](http://i.imgur.com/Jco3m.jpg). He really came to life in extra-time when he put his dribbling skills on display and feeding Ramires for the 5th goal.

**Sturridge: 8.6**-He played like the Sturridge we all know and love by shooting when he feels like it and not making the correct decisions. People were quick to judge him after his early miscues but he played a great game. He worked hard but said it himself in his postmatch interview that he was lacking match sharpness. His goal was via a Manure mistake but he finished well. ",0,1351738803,null,0,false,0,c6uo35l,t3_12foip,t1_c6uo35l,t3_12foip,null,1430289764,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

What I feel would be most effective is a simple finishing man. The midfield players are all wizards who can create instant chances out of thin air. All that's lacking in attack is for a clinical finisher to put those chances into the net the first time. Simply said, it's taking too many chances for both our strikers to get the ball into the net.

I've done quite a bit of work in the past for a lettings agency and a mortgage salesman, and these kind of 25% buy-to-rent mortgages are used all the time by people with bad credit histories and renting out a room (although you might be advised to keep that last bit on the QT from the lender).

AIUI buy-to-rent mortgages are basically no-questions-asked because 25% is enough equity in the property that the bank will have no problems recovering the debt if you fail to make the payments. 

Find a local independent financial advisor. Ask people you know for recommendations and don't be afraid to shop around and meet with more than one until you find someone you like and trust (in fact, it might even be worth getting quotes from more than one, although I've never done this).

""Independent financial advisor"" is a bit of a misnomer because they're paid on commission and they will get better deals from some banks than others. They're required to give you advice comparing 3 different mortgages, but this advice may be tailored so they advise you to take the mortgage that suits them best. 

However, independent financial advisors (freelance mortgage salesmen, in other words) do have access to a much wider selection of mortgage products than you get if you just walk into your bank. It's in these guys' interest to find you a lender who will approve you, and to keep you happy so that you'll come back and remortgage in a few years.

true,icecoldbabes,null,null,"Although it is a straight red card, the suspensions they carry aren't the same. 

What I mean by this is it's *the way you get the card that factors in your suspension*

Ivanovic denied a clear scoring opportunity so he gets a straight red card. He serves a one match **domestic** ban. The Capital One Cup match with Man United just now was part of that ban. 

Also Torres served his one match domestic ban for his two yellow cards. So both players are free to play against Swansea. 

But if the straight red card was from foul play the minimum requirement would be three domestic matches. Which is a ban none of our players have to endure. 

Hope that clears things up. KTBFFH

Luiz 6.5 - played better than the previous match less running forward still has to improve getting caught in position or better coverage from mikel romeu etc if he is going to run forward

Cahill- Agree

Azpi- looked good going forward wasn't really troubled defensively just a clumsy challenge about yeh a 6 or 7

Mikel and Romeu were poor i thought didn't provide much at all same goes with piazon really chelsea looked lot better when these players left the pitch about 4 or 5 , can excuse piazon i guess though

Ramires - one of chelseas better players good work ethic and energy deserved 8

Mata - 7 to 8 - the reason is he looked threatening kinda and strung nice passages of play together but didn't create much good solid effort but not a 9 and the assist was all cahill's work to be fair

Hazard - was our best player easily so a 9

Sturridge- scored a goal which was lucky to be honest to get a goal ruined some good chances with poor touches, also ruined many attacks by being too selfish to his credit did set up moses who missed about a 7 to be honest he was playing vs inexperienced defensive pair and rarely troubled them

Moses - on another night could have had a hat trick if he buried his chances won a penalty with good wing play drifted in and out the game a little but was really bright 8

true,blue_strat,null,null,"If you're born in the UK, the Government will consider you a naturalized British citizen in the absence of other nations' input (your parents' nationalities, etc.). You're given a birth certificate, and when you turn 16 you're given a National Insurance number.

HMRC would know you existed, and if you eventually came into contact with any department of government that asked for your NI number, they would see that you hadn't paid any tax or made NI contributions. If you have a house and a job, that will obviously seem suspect, and you would be investigated for tax evasion.

You could be self-employed and pay HMRC directly, that would minimize your paper trail, or you could probably ask your employer to pay your income tax and NI contributions as usual and pay you in cash. If you had the means to save cash you could eventually buy a house, but you would need legal ownership of it to stop the Crown or other landowner evicting you when they wanted.

I'm not sure if all residential properties are subject to council tax, but I would think it likely, so you would have to keep paying even if you fully paid in cash for a freehold.

Really, there is far more that could connect you to the grid than paying your basic income and property taxes. If you don't have a landline, mobile phone, or the Internet, you're already beyond the reach of 99% of communication. You could pay in cash and not give your address to any companies, which would vastly reduce targeted marketing, and in the right house you could heat, cook, and power with bottled fuel to avoid the energy service companies.

You could buy bottled water too, but bathing would be tedious and expensive. I would include tap water among the basic necessities, but if you're in a bottled fuel household, you could heat it yourself for bathing.

So you could feasibly live comfortably by only being connected to the grid via:

* birth certificate
* National Insurance
* income tax
* land/property ownership
* council tax
* tap water

&gt;Others suggest that trick-or-treating comes from the late medieval practice of souling, when poor folk would go door to door on All Saints receiving soul cakes in return for prayers for dead souls in purgatory. It originated in Ireland and Britain,[1] although similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy.[10] Shakespeare mentions the practice in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593), when Speed accuses his master of ""puling [whimpering or whining] like a beggar at Hallowmas [All Saints]"".[11]

&gt;Guising at Halloween in Scotland is recorded in 1895, where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips, visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and money.[2] The practice of Guising at Halloween in North America is first recorded in 1911, where a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario reported children going ""guising"" around the neighborhood.[12]

&gt;American historian and author Ruth Edna Kelley of Massachusetts wrote the first book length history of the holiday in the US; The Book of Hallowe'en (1919), and references souling in the chapter ""Hallowe'en in America"";

&gt;&gt;The taste in Hallowe'en festivities now is to study old traditions, and hold a Scotch party, using Burn's poem Hallowe'en as a guide; or to go a-souling as the English used. In short, no custom that was once honored at Hallowe'en is out of fashion now.[13]

&gt;Kelley lived in Lynn, Massachusetts, a town with 4,500 Irish immigrants, 1,900 English immigrants, and 700 Scottish immigrants in 1920.[14] In her book, Kelley touches on customs that arrived from across the Atlantic; ""Americans have fostered them, and are making this an occasion something like what it must have been in its best days overseas. All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries"".[15]",0,1351745512,null,0,false,0,c6uphb3,t3_12e6ct,t1_c6uphb3,t1_c6ul7yq,null,1430290485,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We have so many guys who can and do score that Torres has really been sorta playing a creative role up front rather than a ""I'm a finisher"" one.  It almost seems like that sort of creative role seems to suit him more?

But then he's a striker..  so..  he should be scoring more goals.  

What he does do well is drag defenders around with him at all times, creating room for our wizards to operate in.  I think that's one aspect of his game people don't give him credit for.  Opposition defenders know how good Torres can be - he's got to be marked..  very well..  and he usually is.  Maybe that's a part of the reason why he hasn't been as clinical?  He's just always got 1, 2, or even 3 players on him.  And while they're busy looking after him, there's Mata, Oscar, and Hazard running into the empty space vacated by the defenders who are looking after Torres.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"So i'll admit, Dempsey has certainly been less than impressive, but that's mostly in relation to everyone else.

The thing to remember about Dempsey is this; he is the only one of our summer signings who is having to learn an entirely new style of play, and, in effect, a new position.

Dembele is being asked to do exactly what he did at Fulham; pick the ball up deep, advance it on the dribble, create, and make incisive runs. Pretty straightforward.

Gylfi is playing the same style of game he played at Swansea; pass and move; in generally the same position.

Jan is playing exactly the same position and style that he did at Ajax, which is why he's fit in so well; he's playing the same game with different people around him.

That also generally applies to Hugo; he's being asked to keep doing what he was always doing.

But Dempsey, at Fulham, was played either on the wing, but allowed to float inside, or behind the main striker, but was always tasked with simply cleaning up the attacking chances. He was not a creative influence; he's a finisher, a janitor of sorts, cleaning up the chances everyone else makes. And he's very good at that, as we've seen here; despite not creating very many chances, he's popped up and scored 2 goals in 4 games, a decent strike rate for someone who's not a striker.

But here, he's also being tasked with linking up play in the final third, something he's simply not great at. He sees space well, and runs to it, but needs someone to get him the ball. He hasn't had much game time with Dembele, but when he has he's looked far better. The other thing to remember here is that Defoe, who's been on form as our striker, is also a poacher; a great many of the goals that Dempsey would ordinarily get a chance at are being cleaned up by Defoe instead.

What Dempsey needs is a little more time to learn the system and his position in it, and also, Adebayor. Adebayor's ability to create chances for other players will be a huge boon for Dempsey; I think that he will feast off Adebayor's hold-up play in the final third.

Plus his link up play is on another level compared to when he was firing rockets away at Liverpool. He may have scored a lot of goals then, but his pass and go was definitely not as good as it is now. The only thing that concerns me about him is his resilience and aggressiveness. Or lack thereof. It seems that a lot of the time when he gets the ball, if a defender is coming at him he seems to be pretty passive about it. He'll maybe try to maneuver around him once, but it usually ends up him giving the ball away a bit too easily. I find it a bit frustrating to watch.

Mind you there has been times when he has kicked in into overdrive and tried to dribble around the opposition. But those moments seem a lot more rare. 

Right now, I believe he is our best option among the players on the team. His movement attracts more attention when compared to Sturridge. Danny Boy seems to be more of a poacher so unless he's in the 18 yard box not much attention is given to him (when comparing back to Torres). Torres has also shown he can still finish nicely (even though it doesn't happen all the time) and he is a fairly good team player.

true,LFCPhoenix28,lfc68,,"Today's performance was really disappointing. Liverpool will always be the club I support, and I'll always stand beside them during the ups and downs. With all that being said, with all the fringe players being played and some youngsters as well...I feel like the standard and the mentality that we needed to bring to this game was completely absent. Liverpool need to realize that even in a time of rebuilding with a younger squad, we need to raise the standards. The past few season have not been good enough, and even in the Rodgers era so far...the results are not incredibly impressive. 

It really just bothers me that this club was so successful, and even moderately successful as close as four or so years ago...and now it seems like we just settle. Oh we lost this or that, well maybe next time. No. That doesn't sit well with me. It's time to step up and be that striker to take charge, support Suarez and earn a spot on the first team. We need our youngsters to really play their hearts out every chance they get, work as a cohesive unit, and keep their heads held high. Losing to Swansea is not acceptable for a club of this standard. I don't want to keep making excuses  about who we played, what happened, etc. We need the results, and the way we get them is by putting that fire under every member of that club whether it is Cole or Gerrard...Sterling or Shelvey. We can't settle anymore, we have to push as a club to get back to that top spot. Mid-table is not cozy, and if playing with the likes of City, Chelsea, and United is going to be a three-point affair...then we have to start earning it straight away. It is difficult to win a game with one goal, as it was today with the spotty defending of the kids out there...but that's where you step up and make something happen as a playmaker and innovator. Be the difference on the pitch, whereas right now I feel like everyone is staring at the ground and saying, ""Not me.""

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"While I completely agree with the fact that our club is being very annoyingly unsuccessful (with results) recently, it is *a lot* to ask from the youngsters to ""step up and make something happen"". It was already a lot for these youngsters to break into the first team and play against top notch teams in the PL. As Sterling or Suso, regulars in the first team now, it's obviously quite surreal for them to jump from reserves to regular first team members within the span of, what, six months?

There is already plenty of pressure on our boys, especially the younger ones. How many sides in the PL are playing 18, 19 year olds regularly in the first team, and sometimes even leaving them for the full 90 minutes (Sterling)? I can't help but think it's stressful enough on our youngsters.

There's really nothing we can do about it now. We had a horrible transfer season and a large amount of important injuries (Borini, Lucas, Kelly). The only thing we can do now is to wait until January, and **perhaps** we'll finally get to see some sort of change.

The Brendan Rodgers era may not have reached it's peak yet. Wait until we get an experienced, formidable team before we can start to see results.

I rang the office of the taxi firm and said their driver was being attacked, and they sent another driver to him to rescue him. The car was a mess. Needless to say, I wasn't able to use that firm again as they refused to come here unless they charged extra.

Apart from describing how hypnosis is supposed to work, ""I was just going along with it"" there was fuck all else in this of any value whatsoever.
""Derren was giving me direction off camera"", well yeah, how else is a hypnotised subject supposed to get the directions of the hypnotist ? Telepathy ??

I've seen some of the videos and presentations Derren does for ""The Magic Circle"" and others in the trade dating back to the late 90s. He is the real deal, his act doesn't deviate from what you see on stage/screen except that he gives more technical explanations of what he's doing. 

I've been on stage with him and I take an interest in these things. The trick he did with me (and others) included picking a card from a deck, choosing a position on stage and picking a random number. I know how he got me to pick the card, he was using a short-and-tall deck, but the rest of it was a mystery.

He's upfront about what he does and how he does it, he manages to entertain (spectacularly well I'd say) and inform.

Firstly the title is fucking shit, our armed police already have ""battlefield"" weapons.

Nothing state of the art about the C8 which was produced in the 80s, its just a good carbine. 

Silences and different sights?!? So Fucking what? Most all weapons allow for different sights , and sound moderators should be on most all weapons to be fair, its not some uber special forces tool especially when police will be firing most likely in build up areas the noise is unnecessary and the effect moderators have on ballistics is negligible. Like with sights most all firearms come with this feature already anyway. Hell, I'm pretty sure the police recommend moderators for civilian shooters for noise safety concern.

Again, most all weapons can fit a grenade launcher of sorts already.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"Dreadful performance. In other games we've been good going forward but porous through the midfield, or vice versa. Somehow we managed to be static on the ball and all over the place without it. On attack everyone would just stand and watch the player in possession, while in defence players were running around randomly and letting them play through us with a couple of passes.

What happened to our football? There was so much lumping it into the box last night, very little team interplay or cohesion. Where is the patient, precise passing and movement from the WBA game in the 3rd round? That's the biggest problem for me recently, bad games happen but everything we were doing was five steps back from a month ago. Are the players not trusting the manager's system? Did the manager change his system?

Specific players:
Suarez - criticism above doesn't apply here. Pretty much the only player who was trying to provide options for team mates, anticipating, getting into space

Jones - some great saves but horrible distribution. He's done well but hoping for Pepe to come back soon

Henderson - considering it's not his position did ok. Should be playing central midfield instead of Shelvey who was awful

Robinson - looks sound

Gerrard - nice ball for the goal but otherwise a liability. Kept getting pulled out of position and then not getting back, made it easy for Swansea to get between our midfield and defence. And him and shelvey between them must have played about 40 aimless lumps into the swansea box. 

Allen - form is off compared to earlier in the season. Did some good stuff but also got caught in possession. May be attributed to lack of movement off the ball or the evaporation of our pattern of play?

Joe Cole - main contribution was a cushioned header back to their keeper. Fuck off Purslow.

Downing - really not that bad and shouldn't be scapegoated. He really lacks game intelligence but he kept trying and worked hard.


Overall, lots of people crying about strikers but the midfield is the real problem area. We have a great striker, the only problem is what happens if he gets tired, suspended or injured. Our midfield is managing to both be both limp defensively and terrible creatively. I'd bring in Henderson to play alongside Allen to give a solid base there, two players who do the basics well and won't slack off.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Did you ever watch Ian Rush play? He pretty much invented the concept of ""defending from the front"" and, as far as I'm concerned, he was the prototypical 6 yard poacher.

Never saw Rush live, I'm far too young for that, and most videos/highlights don't go out of their way to show 'defending from the front'.

You're right about a good striker creating space, and the effect Suarez's dropping deep has on creating space for midfielders is something I hadn't thought of; although Suarez dropping deep does create space for wide players, it's just that it'd been forever since we had threatening wide players. But yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

To an extent, it seems we're arguing semantics over what a poacher is - for me, the term poacher is used for a striker who gets goals but doesn't provide much else. I'm pretty sure you're not advocating that we sign someone that one-dimensional.

&gt; Can you name many strikers right now that fulfil the perfect package you've mentioned?

I commented on something similar on my old account, but I'm thinking of the likes of Huntelaar (definitely clinical in front of goal, but much more than a poacher), Leandro Damiao, possibly Demba Ba, Gary Hooper, and just for something left-field, Jelle Vossen, who's scoring for fun at Genk.

true,m1ndwipe,null,null,"It is weird that people complain about the adverts. It's an ad funded service. Do people expect it to get money from magic?

As for performance, to be honest the vast majority of the time with any catch up service the issue is the links between your ISP and the CDN. I know iPlayer uses three major Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for distribution - Akamai, Level 3 and Limelight. I believe Channel 4 only use two (can't remember what they are off the top of my head and a quick Google doesn't remind me, but I think Akamai is one of them).

Ultimately the caching for any VOD service has to be sufficiently high that the CDN is basically deliving it to you, and CDNs all have peering arrangements with your ISP in order to deliver that data. But the quality of said peering arrangements varies by ISP, and by CDN. And you're usually assigned by the website to a CDN randomly.

If you're unlucky you end up with an CDN where your ISP has a slow or limited link, and connection speeds suffer, or the pipe gets congested at busy times and everything falls over.

So some people will use iPlayer and have no problems but find 4OD unusable. Some people will find the opposite. iPlayer using more CDNs and not having to switch providers constantly to serve adverts is certainly helpful though, so more people will find iPlayer better than the other way around. ISPs also have to do a better job of looking after iPlayer, as people complain to them pretty bloody quick if it doesn't work, while 4OD has a good, but still much smaller, userbase.

There's certainly other areas that could be the problem, but this is the most likely situation in many cases. CDN peering arrangements are actually a pretty important way of determining a good ISP for many people, but there's absolutely no way of telling before you sign up with them if the performance is any good or not. There's no published metrics, and they change pretty often (there was an FOI request to the BBC that resulted in the publication of some figures, but it's out of date - http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/iplayer_bandwidth_diagnostic_inf?unfold=1)",0,1351764172,null,0,false,0,c6uro6l,t3_12f27j,t1_c6uro6l,t3_12f27j,null,1430291522,18,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,18

I thought that before substitutions were made, the teams were more or less equal. 

Also I think people take for granted the fact that Hazard and Oscar are 20 and 21 and that this is their first season in England. The fact they've been so efficient so far means that their inexperience is often over looked (take Buttner, he's older than both those lads for example).

That video shows flickering, I'm not sure what other proof you need or were looking for, it doesn't show a yeti or Santa. There have been cases of flickering being so bad, they've just shut down the wind farms at the hight of energy generation.

&gt;turbines aren't placed that close

The house in the video was 300 meters away from the turbine. How far away does it need to be, which may be a problem since:

Land is the most finite resource we have in this country. Building energy generators that have to be turned off because of public health effects (see one of my to her posts here) doesn't help anybody, least of all the environment.

Especially as green energy suppliers are under contract to supply a minimum amount of energy. So guess what happens when they can't supply the energy? They buy it. From whom? Polluting energy suppliers. 

So not only can we end up with massive towers turning off at key points in the day to avoid local upset and health issues, but up to 33% of ""its"" power will come from oil anyway and be more expensive because the green suppliers still need to make a profit.

I agree we need more green energy, and I quite like the look of windfarms (though I wouldn't like to live near it if it flickers all morning or evening), but as I said above, no government will make this work. Meanwhile the power starts going off in 5-15 years, plenty of time for the parties to blame each other.

&gt;Yeah, you'll have no problem getting a buy-to-rent mortgage - 25% is the standard.

Oh so as long as he can stump up the 25% deposit who give s shit if he can pay the mortgage (bearing in mind the OP already stated he is a Sole Trader rather than a salaried employee so his income monthly may be seen to fluctuate rather than be steady each month)

&gt;I've done quite a bit of work in the past for a lettings agency and a mortgage salesman, and these kind of 25% buy-to-rent mortgages are used all the time by people with bad credit histories and renting out a room (although you might be advised to keep that last bit on the QT from the lender).

So then surely he is misleading the lender by trying to obtain a Buy to Let if he is going to be living in the property himself? with a Buy to Let the banks expectation is that the tenants will meet the rental payments that will pay for the mortgage, instead you are advising the OP to get the incorrect mortgage that he needs, omit that he will be taking in a lodger and I am assuming lie about the amount of income the property would be expected to generate?

To the OP, my advice would be to ignore the 'financial advisors' at the banks, instead go independent , or indeed try the P2P banks (Handelsbanken etc) for advice, Also in all honesty? I would probably stay away from investing in bricks and mortar if the going cost is more than £1000 per square metre, anything over this is overpriced.

true,goschumi1986,null,null,"I just read your OP again, and it's indeed more complicated than I thought it was. I understand what you are saying. Remember: EU law only applies when you travel between different EU States. 

As you pointed out, Gibraltar is part of the EU (true). Now you just have to make the case that it's a different State than the UK and you're set.

Only, that's a case that is hard to make. As you pointed out: ""The Treaties apply to Gibraltar **as a European territory for whose external relations a Member State is responsible**."" Furthermore, because of a declaration of the UK in 1982 Gibraltarians are to be counted as British nationals for the purposes of Community law. All Gibraltarians have since been granted full British citizenship. In the 2004 European Parliament election the territory formed part of the South West England constituency of the United Kingdom, so it didn't have elections in its own rights. The inclusion was unsuccessfully challenged by Spain before the European Court of Justice. Gibraltar is part of the EU, but only under the responsibility of the UK. It's not a different State than the UK.

But why look at Gibraltar and not at Spain, where you live? I'm actually going to look this up, but I guess it has to do with the background of the freedoms, which is making one common European market. But Gibraltar is not part of the customs union and VAT area (you pointed that out earlier aswell). The customs union and VAT area are very important aspects of the common market. The freedoms are tools to make the common market exist and work, they should always be seen in that light. I don't see why they should be applied when there is no benefit for this common market. I think that's the problem. I'm not sure though. I think yours is a very interesting case, more interesting than I originally thought. Which sucks for you. I'm very sorry.

let me put it into more detail fior you (and FYI it is not a Jealous Rant but more an indictment of mortgages at present)

So the OP can stump up the 25% mortage, as a sole trader (trading unknown, income unkown) Strolls advises that he should have no issue getting the 25% deposit for a mortgage.

Clearly he should have been advising that, even if he can make the 25% mortgage, he should be ensuring he gets the correct product, that his sole earning capability is more than enough to cover the Mortgage payments.

instead (to me) he appears to go off on half cocked, advising the OP to get a BtL mortgage, Live in the property and not declare he is getting a lodger in,, effectively lying about his ability to repay the loan.

Which would be self defeating if the OP got the mortgage then found himself unable to meet the repayments. Hence why further down my post I advised him to seek independent advice rather than going off what the bank tell's him he can get and pay back.

Dempsey ISN'T a striker. He's a a decent CAM/winger/inside forward, that absolutely excels at cleaning up chances in the box, losing defenders on runs to space, and bringing in more players to attack.

But when your gameplan is ""Give it to Bale to run in"" or ""Pass to Defoe just outside the box and let him shoot"", you're bound to be disappointed when your 10 looks to pass back or wide to Lennon to bring in more players to the attack. It's the remnants of the system at Fulham. Spurs are playing more of a run-and-gun, using Lennon and Bale for pace, and Defoe for finishing.

A player like Dempsey is essential to a slower pace game. Maybe we won't be playing slower football much this season, but I believe with Adebayor, Dembele, and Parker back, we will see a style of football much more conducive to Dempsey's strengths.

Until then, I'm fine with how he's played, but would support using him as a super sub/cleaner.

Most importantly, data relevant to individual cases and systemic issues can be hidden behind commercial confidentiality, whereas at least with a public system the retention and provision of data can be mandated. And it should be, and ease of investigation/auditing improved, but it is impossible to argue that this situation will be improved by privatisation.

A good analogy is how drug trials are currently a festering pit of deception and scams (I say this as a health researcher). There are so many tricks that I can't go into them here, but in essence commercial imperative trumps patient safety without a second thought. Whistleblowers are likely to find themselves sued into oblivian. Hell, even open public researchers get sued for libel regularly simply for using science to suggest that a drug may not be safe.

This threat of libel will also rule the media out as a useful external investigator of private hospitals. I don't believe this approach is currently aggressively used by the NHS, but it is used by the pharmas.

Also at the moment public health researchers can obtain pretty comprehensive data; this will become virtually impossible, leading to a slowing in both population health research and detection of wide-spread issues.

So, yes, there's a whole big important thing there, and you are totally right that external auditing (whether for individual or systemic cases) of hospitals/medical provision in general, is woefully inadequate.

true,Grimslei,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"When you say multicultural do you really mean multicultural or are you actually thinking more along the lines of multiethnic?

For me, I don't really understand a purposeful drive for either beyond any natural shift. What I mean by that is, say, if you were taking applicants for a job and you purposefully hired a person due his race rather than by his ability simply because you wanted to meet a diversity quota. This, as well as any other situation whereby a person's race shouldn't be the focus at hand, make absolutely no sense to me whatsoever.

As for multiculturalism, surely the only way to preserve each culture within the same society is for individuals to each practice and uphold their own culture within the same space. Surely the alternative - that they all merge together to become a mass, unified culture originally comprised of different cultures - would imply a single, changed culture, and hence it would no longer be a multicultural society. It would just result in a shift in the general culture.

Consequently when I think multiculturalism, I generally think either ""change of overall culture"" or ""ghettos of multiple cultures"". On a small scale this could prove beneficial. On a large scale, especially over a short space of time, it is bound to cause friction.

One other thing - the question that really ought to be asked as with any purposeful move or shift from a default is ""for what reason do you think this should occur?"" rather than, ""for what reason should it not?"". I'm genuinely curious - what are the main arguments for continuing multiculturalism further than the level that it is at the present?",0,1351777303,null,0,1351777704,0,c6ut9fx,t3_12gc66,t1_c6ut9fx,t3_12gc66,null,1430292267,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The prisoners, the prison officers and prison service all reached this agreement together, however the prison officers themselves have since backtracked and continued their policy of regularly beating up prisoners while humiliating them with unnecessary strip searches.

I say unnecessary because part of the agreement was that instead of strip searches they would use one of those electronic scanner chairs like they use in English prisons. They actually purchased these chairs and installed them. But when it comes time for a search they walk the prisoners past these rooms, into the old strip search facilities and then beat the shit out of them.

Republicans have been very vocal over the last 1-2 years about this issue in a peaceful manner. It's obvious they were going to resort to the murder of a prison officer if they got nowhere and this is what happened. Honestly I'm surprised they have been so restrained, they obviously didn't want to do this but the bigotry and stubbornness of the prison officers has forced their hand.

Hard to tell.  As for the the offside goal, obviously it was offside, but it was a good finish despite that.  Your defense didn't pick him up, and a bad call was made.  Unlucky at that point in time, but overall I still think Man U would have won despite that.  Now before you all downvote me to hell, obviously i'm biased but that's just my opinion.

Britain *is* multicultural.

You appear to be wholly ignorant of that.  From the Romans to the Normans, from the Irish to the Huguenots, from the Jamaicans to the Indians, each successive wave of immigrants have changed Britain for the better.  Yes, teething troubles happen, but those of us with a grasp of history know they are temporary, whereas the benefits immigration brings last forever.  The infrastructure of Britain wouldn't be what it is without first the Romans and then the Irish.  The language and tradition wouldn't be the same without the Normans.  Our diets wouldn't be the same without the Indians.  London wouldn't be the same without the Jamaicans (hell, they helped rebuild the country after WWII).  Hell - without immigrants, the shops would still be closed on Sundays.  The list goes on and on and on and on.

Every minority and majority rapes, and honour killings are cultural and have nothing to do with Islam (we know this as they have been recorded before Islam even exists, and are similar to what was once considered normal behaviour in 'polite' British society centuries ago).

true,LFCPhoenix28,lfc68,,"I think as a whole, Liverpool have always been a club that can turn little into much more...but on the contrary, they can't make something out of nothing. Seeing Gerrard come in as a young lad and make his first start for Liverpool and break into the first team is really the case in point that comes to mind with youngsters stepping up and making it happen. I realize we don't have a lot of young Gerrards or Sterlings, but I think if we expect the same standard of play in the long run, developmentally we can begin to see results sooner than perhaps normally expected. As an organization, the resources they have at Melwood and through previous reserve team matches is absolutely top-class. I don't expect Coates to help keep a clean sheet against Chelsea any time soon, but I do expect him to cover crosses into the box that result in all too easy goals as in the Swansea game.

That, though, is the remarkable nature of the club...putting these kids against top flight teams and taking their potential to make little into much more. The stress as a youngster is immense, but that's the atmosphere day in and day out for regular first-team members. I really hope they use this past game as a teaching tool, and management sees that we can't overlook losses like these where we almost didn't even show up in the first half...no matter who we are playing.

The transfer window was absolutely frustrating. While the likes of securing Dempsey were out of the club's price range, loaning Carroll without purchasing support up top was an absolute disaster. January will tell us as a club where Rodgers is mentally, and how he can go about rebuilding the team after seeing how they have performed in the first half of the season. I want him to do well at Liverpool, and I believe he can...I don't know if he will.

After Rodgers took Swansea as far as he did, I know results can be attained and that comes from raising the standard first and foremost. I think if we show steady improvement, I, along with many Reds, will be satisfied. That's the real indicator in the run of things, and right now we just aren't there yet. I have faith in this team, and faith in our youngsters. It's a lot to ask, but we wouldn't ever ask anything above the capacity of our players. That's why they are here. It's why we give fringe players a shot in games like this, and the same reason why kids like Sterling have stepped up and taken a role in changing the team's dynamic.",0,1351785332,null,0,false,0,c6uv2n4,t3_12f8d5,t1_c6uv2n4,t1_c6uqzys,null,1430293122,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If I'm perfectly honest I have no idea about how the credit transfer system works for international students, although I'm sure someone on here knows at least a bit about it.

I do know a bit about the accommodation though, and it all really comes down to what kind of living arrangements you're after. You can get rooms in flats that are both en-suite or with a shared bathroom and since you're an international student you'll be 100% guaranteed a place on campus so you won't have to worry about getting into uni from town or anything.

There's also 'town houses' on campus which are a bit more expensive but come with like a living room/dining area type space. Again, it depends what kind of thing you're looking for.

Aim for a trophy, and win it, starting with Capital One/Carling. Yes, you could argue that we are the champions of Europe, but this is RDM's first, full season with the team and the lineup and roster has dramatically changed. Players have to gel, to know they can win a trophy, regardless of which one. 

I would have like to have seen the likes of Marin come on and Piazon get more time, but the team was given a situation where if we wanted to win, there wasn't time to gamble on a player who hasn't had his full debut,  or one who was under performing, we needed a sure bet (hazard, oscar, etc.). Also, in terms of reserves, all our best youth are on loan! ie. Hutchinson, Courtois, DeBruyne, Lukaku, McEachran, etc. 

In terms of squad strength I'm worried as this shows, in the short term, how thin our squad is. Three suspensions (thankfully Iva and Torres have filled their ban quota), one injury (Lamps) and to top it off Sturridge really didn't look super impressive, considering we want him pressuring Torres' starting position (not to say he had a bad game, he just needs to be more consistent). In terms of fitness and this coming weekend, we are dealing with professional athletes here, if they can't perform in games roughly 3-4 days apart then they are not fit enough. Being in top-level football requires top-level fitness and professionalism, if they don't have that then they don't belong on the team.

**First they ignore you**

Before their initial keynote sales graphs/projections they would often just reference the competition as other OS's or other tablets.

**Then they ridicule you**

Jokes about those other crappy OS's in later keynotes, all very dismissive. One after keynote speech where Job's tells people if you want porn, use Android.

**Then they fight you**

What we're seeing now, with legal battles and I'm sure Android is in for more of a direct legal kicking by Apple as it gains even more ground.

The latest keynote where they directly show comparisons of an Android tablet to that of the iPad mini. Android can no longer be ignored and is being treated as an equal in their keynotes.

**Then you win**

Apple turns into a winey bitch, inevitably losing the market to Android. Android outweighs Apple on mobile &amp; tablets because of in choice of hardware (much like Windows dominates the PC market even today) also because Android also matures on the tablet front with dedicated tablet versions of apps.

central heating. The legislation is very basic and
only requires that heating is provided to one
main living room. This should normally comprise
a reasonably efficient and safely designed and
installed fixed heating source or, failing this, a safe
and fully connected gas point at the working flue,
or a safe electrical installation with a dedicated
socket and space suitable for a fixed electrical
heating appliance. Other rooms should have
sufficient sockets for electric fires to be used.

* Sell him to a small club? - Nearly impossible unless Joe Cole agrees to much lower wages.
* Sell him to a big club? - Again, his wages aren't commensurate with his performance and what big club would go with Joe Cole when they have the resources for others?
* Loan him out, then. - To who? Even in that situation we'd likely be eating a chunk of his wages.
* Bench him! - I suppose but it's hard to keep 90k/wk sitting on the bench.

What can we possibly do? Well, if Joe Cole is fit, we should try and get him as many minutes as possible.

At least Stewart Downing has a decent body of work this season that can be shown to interested teams (surely Downing is on his way out in January) but it's a difficult sell with Cole.

true,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,™,"Police are given cars at very reduced prices, or even free. There are several reasons;

1) Companies get a certain ""cache"" from having their car used by the police - the idea being police only use high performance, economic, cars. Cars used by the police usually end up being purchased by the general public in higher quantities. 

2) The police spend a fortune on cars every year and even charging just over cost price if you have a fleet of several hundred cars you can still make a nice profit, plus parts, services, etc.

3) The police sometimes borrow cars for no money to trial them, for example Hyundai may lend (permanently) a couple of cars to be kitted up by the police who will then assess and decide if they want to use them permanently. Manufacturers give them for free as they could get a good contract from it for a small loss.

4) Police officers have a high likelihood of purchasing or recommending the car they drive for work, therefore you have a lot more people who may buy your car.

For all of the above reasons you'll see police forces driving cars like Jaguars, Audis, etc and they probably paid what you'd spend for a Ford Focus.

Indeed some forces have turned down entire fleets of ""luxury"" cars for the same price they have for their ""standard"" cars because the public may think they are wasting money!

What did you feel about the Torres tackle on Cleverley as well ?

Point is that the ref and linesman made two bad calls but does that negate the fact that United had the upper hand (and a very valid complaint as well) before that when things were fair and square (atleast for you). We will never know what could have happened but in all honesty, even before those two decisions, United were in a far better position to win the match than Chelsea.

The chelsea circle jerk has been too strong for any logic but you seem like willing to talk with a cool head so I am going to talk to you.

PS : If Ivanovic hadn't been off, at 11 vs 11, I do think Chelsea were looking good to win the match (although I personally never count United out of scoring goals at any given time).",0,1351795077,null,0,1351795824,0,c6uxokx,t3_12fspd,t1_c6uxokx,t1_c6utsgo,null,1430294456,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

He is not, and has pressed the issue, anti-EU, and the terms EU-sceptical and anti-EU cannot be treated synonymously.

I'd also add there's a very real difference between the Conservative's *active* vision, which many people on the continent are only too aware of, and Labour's current position.  The Conservatives are very much in the Machiavellian act of arguing for a two tier Europe for current members.  Osborne has come out in favour of it, by no doubt with cabinet sanction, via the Financial Times.  David Miliband in the same publication has decried the foundations of this in the same publication, criticising the effective UK annulment of the Fiscal Pact last December and their opt out of Justice and Home Affairs agreements.

They're not convergent, that's part of the hypocrisy behind Labour siding now with the Conservative anti-EU and UKIP element.

Of course things should be more efficient - that is what administrators are working to accomplish every day. They literally work every day, 8 hours a day, to accomplish such a thing. 

Recently in Canada they introduced new online wait time schedules for labs and it made things much more efficient. 

But to discuss how taxpayers are getting hurt because there are ""inefficiencies"" in public health - pardon, but isn't the argument Americans have been using for decades to privatize everything under the sun, and isn't it what Thatcher used in the 80s to quash and burn public services and unions? 

My analogy of heat off a stove does withstand a test - certain inefficiencies are not necessarily bad, and even having ""lazy"" or inefficient emploees earn paycheques is not a bad thing for society. 

Efficiency is a managerial term that gets thrown about without much consideration as to what that means. In Scotland, they wanted to make hospital cleaning a far more efficient game - privatizing the staff - and they ended up with serious problems in having things clean, lowering level of infections, as well as keeping the costs down. In the end, they reverted back to having the cleaning staff public, as it turned out that it was the only way of keeping things sterile and getting sheets properly treated, and knowing that the employees underwent training for the job.

true,GreatZapper,null,null,"School governor (at an LEA primary) here.  The school *should* have a complaints policy - although this will be in the hands of the head and/or the governors so is a bit of a Kafka-esque nightmare for you.

I've dug ours out, and it does have the step of a Governor's panel on it, which decides on the issue (but no mention of a time frame, unfortunately).  However, and I think this is pretty standard, once the governors have heard it and made a decision, I think that's pretty much it.

Nevertheless, regarding the conflict of interest, it's not unknown for Governor Services to email Governors at other schools to ask to sit on a panel to help decide.  I get a few of these every so often.  However, the time frame is quite protracted sometimes, not least as these things are often held during school hours and most governors work.

Exactly *who* are you in contact with?  Are you in direct contact with the Chair, or going through the Clerk?  It might be worth seeing if you can get some contact details of the Chair themselves, as these are usually quite reasonable people and will try and help.  The bureaucracy of going through the Clerk, while the ""proper"" way, is often quite frustrating.

Finally - I wonder if they're giving you the brush-off for a couple of reasons.  Either because they're in the Head's pocket, which is entirely possible though a governors role is to challenge as well as support, or they think your complaint is borderline frivolous and not worth the time, as by this stage it's already presumably been channelled via the Head to deal with already.  

That said, they're not going to censure/fire the Head without strong evidence of gross misconduct.  So you might want to ask yourself exactly what you want to achieve by this.  The chances of getting much to change as a result of this are slim unless you can prove gross misconduct, and you'd need a watertight case.

No doubt however, that if the head is ""failing"", the governors and LEA and even Ofsted will be very aware of it, and taking steps already that they will not be able to even mention to you.

I could also argue that Hazard is by no means inexperienced, starting in Ligue 1. And saying Buttner is a first teamer is like saying Dave or Romeu are first teamer.  (Wow, I just realized that Buttner is older than Rafael). And based on recent form (and one debilitating illness), Nani and Fletcher are not really close to Mata and Moses.

However, I'm not going to start posting pictures of politicians that do not have some topic of discussion surrounding them because that's spamming. I'm not going to post links to news on the BBC website, when I (and most of the people here probably) have the fucking site bookmarked and are more than capable of reading the news there. However, when someone does post a link to a BBC news article, I'm willing to get involved in the discussion of. Which I've done so, so far.

If you can't take criticism and defend your position without whinging like a child, don't post your bullshit in a public forum.

I never said they were. I said 
&gt;our youngest have been going through the academy and reserves

 which is a correct statement. Well I'll add the academy and/or the reserves to be truly pedantic since you seem to be attacking that single part of my argument (albeit incorrectly). 

But did you not have to end up bringing in Oscar, Hazard and Ramires in? I understand that you were trying to win and that was the best way to achieve that end, but by bringing them out, against a back line with one regular starter, Chelsea put themselves into a place where the suggestion that you
&gt;needed world class players

is implanted into the mind. I mean you DID end up needing them to win. We will never know if not bringing them on would have ended in the same result, but by bringing them on AND THEN WINNING, it leads to the relation that you needed to play world class players against our youth players in order to win. 
This ISN'T a battle of academies, yes we lost and you won, but considering the quality of players that ended up playing, you SHOULD'VE won. If Manchester United play against Scunthorpe United and win, we wouldn't celebrate and regale the world with our superiority; it was expected. We chose to play players that gave us a greater chance of defeat, and defeated we were; if it makes you feel better to have defeated that side than so be it. You can take this. I'll gladly take the three points and be more proud of that.

is a tired, butt-hurt excuse. If Chelsea had ended up losing, this game would also have turned into a circle-jerk of ""manure paid off teh refs again. OMG HAND BALL IN THE BOX"".

Here is another interesting fact for you.  If Gibraltar is not a different EU state than the UK. Then why is a UK Visa not accepted in Gibraltar and vice versa (Unless the visa is over 1 year time iirc).  British citizens require a passport to fly from London to Gibraltar. Drivers license is NOT sufficient.   An EEA Family permit for the UK does not work in Gibraltar and vice versa either.  I've also heard that in some cases a Gibraltar ID card hasn't been sufficient either to fly to the UK.

Gibraltar allow my wife through as long as she is walking through with me, recognising her Spanish residence card, as a family member of EU Citizen without issue. But the UK doesnt refuses to accept this.

What i'm saying is, is that in an immigration sense, they act as two completely separate countries.  They are! Theyre both self governing, they have their own independent laws.  For example you can drink in Gibraltar at the age of 16 in a lot of places.  Yet suddenly when it comes to applying for an EEA Family permit, its suddenly ""not another member state""  What?  They can't have it both ways surely!?

You've got a lot of Moroccan immigration into Spain and Gibraltar whom have teamed up with Brits who are living there. Not to mention Russia and eastern Europe who have come across.

The problem to me is the fact that the EU national is defined different in UK immigration law. As a British citizen vs an EU citizen appear to have totally different rules (that actually favor the EU citizen in this case) and its only due to Surinder Singh court ruling where the UK have put in place that a British citizen proving that they are living and working in another EU Member state can truly be treated the same as an EU Citizen.

The other problem of course (which has kicked this whole thing off) is that EU Law states 2004/38/EC article 5 paragraph 2:

&gt; Family members who are not nationals of a Member State shall only be required to have an entry visa in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 or, where appropriate, with national law. For the purposes of this Directive, possession of the valid residence card referred to in Article 10 shall exempt such family members from the visa requirement.

Well my wife has that residence card, and the UK actually follow this law. Its written pretty much word for word in its policies.  Unfortunately the UK's definition of ""residence card"" is:

&gt;""residence card"" means a card issued to a person who is not an EEA national, in accordance with regulation 17, as proof of the holder's right of residence in the United Kingdom as at the date of issue;


So if they just amended ""in the United Kingdom"" to ""in an EU Member state""  then this whole situation will be resolved.  We could jump on a plane tonight without going through any bullcrap.

Stirling and nearby can be nice for a day, good transport to the city at least. 

St Andrews is worth seeing, though not sure what the public transport situation is. If you get driving by when summer comes around again, hit the beach just north of it by Tentsmuir forest (also a decent spot for a bike ride). 

Going a little further, Loch Lomond. Can be done for a daytrip, alternately book a cabin and find some hillwalking gear. Doubt this is viable without a car or at least touristy tour.

For train rides, have a look at [SRPS Railtours](http://www.srps.org.uk/railtours/) which is a commercial arm of a rail museum charity near Falkirk. Perhaps not that well suited to travelling alone though? On the other hand some trips should be very accessible as they can pick you up from regular train stations en route.

Man Utd's midfield outperformed ours, which on paper I wasn't fully expecting, but then again, I wasn't expecting Anderson to have a blinder. It felt to me a few of those players were playing for their spot in the first team squad/new contract! 

For me the bench was what really changed it; I feel Ferguson was willing to take a bigger risk, whereas RDM wasn't going to do that. Maybe it's just down to the fact that RDM needs to win all the games he can to try and stay in a job longer than those 2 years? 

Your point on Hazard is true, I was mainly referring to his inexperience in England, which has proven to be a very tricky league to get accustomed to. 

Azpilicueta and Buttner were first teamers in their respective leagues, but I think I expressed myself incorrectly in my OP. Romeu played for Barca B, and I don't know the level of quality in the Spanish Segunda Division; also he faded badly when he stopped getting games under AVB and I don't think I've been that impressed with him since those first few games of last season.

At the end of the day we could go back and forth of who we think is better or worse, but it was a good game. After all, it's only the League Cup: Micky Mouse Cup if you lose, best trophy ever if you win!

I would also like to point out another few helpful hints:
If you see a hedgehog out during the day, something is wrong. If you can, put it somewhere safe. If its small, put warm water in an empty bottle, wraped in a cloth next to it in a box. Shredded news paper is good for keeping them warm and covered too. Then as soon as you can, take it to some where for it to be looked at properly.

Never feed a hedgehog milk or bread. (I think most people know this one now) they are lactose intolerant (so lactofree milk is fine!) 

If you want to feed them, cat food is the best. Or dried meal worms, usually bought for bird feed, they love them!

It's quite good in that most of the rooms here, whether en-suite or not, will be in a flat with 8 people and the kitchen will always be shared so there's loads of opportunity to socialise. I guess the town house style flats are the most social with the little living area but they're shared bathrooms so I don't think they'll be what you're after.

You also might need to think about what college your going to be in. The uni is split up into 8 'collages' (think houses from Harry Potter just without the magic). You'll live with people in your college and they're like mini-communities really but each college offers a different range of accommodations so you'll need to make sure the college you apply to is also offering the type of room you want.

It's time for a big change in UK drug policy. The current system does not work, is not science based and is based on knee jerk reactions by politicians who don't understand the subject on any level other than from a perceived moral high ground. 

Experimentation with drugs is natural and will be done no matter what the government does. The best they could do would be to provide education to school kids from the age of 10 about the risks of (especially underage) drug use and to set up pharmacist style drug stores with educated staff to sell cannabis, ecstasy, psilocybin, LSD and the current safer legal highs such as Kratom to the general public with some friendly advice on safe usage. Cocaine, opiates and other potentially habit forming drugs would be available to those who are willing to register and have their use monitored by trained medical staff who could help prevent addiction and overdose.

This is about letting people do what they want with their body and their mind, safely and guided by people who know what they are doing. The current policy denies freedoms that would do no harm to a person or the greater society and endangers people through organized crime. 

The things that can really harm a person - opiates etc - are being taken anyway. With proper education and monitoring, I doubt there would be an increase in people using smack.

If Hendo goes I think that would be harsh. He is a great talent but we have such a deep midfield it's no wonder he can't break through. I could see him as a Sahin one day, he already has something ridiculous like 150 appearances for his career. In fact, I've always viewed him as future Liverpool captain.  The way he directs on the field and the effort he puts into his game standout to me.  We just have to get a spot for him.

Enrique still hasn't reached previous levels and if we already have a backup ready let's go ahead and pull the trigger and get a new LB with Robinson as the backup.

Cole. Not even once. Need I say anything?

Downing. It's time. He just obviously isn't fitting in and working here. He is being asked to play a different type of play. It's kind of like the Carroll situation, I want him to go to a club where he is appreciated instead of being our scapegoat or wallowing on the bench.

It's probably my favourite place to eat in Brighton. Really cheap, but really tasty food, and the owners are incredibly friendly and helpful. They keep a good selection of bottled ales at all times too. I go there often with my boyfriend, I find it very cosy and romantic :) 

Has anyone mentioned the Booth Museum yet? It's a museum of taxidermied creatures up on Dyke Road... I think entry might be free? And it's very odd. Might be worth googling to see if it's your kind of thing.

I don't think the pier is closed actually, you should still be in luck. Don't go on the rollercoaster, it's a proper neckbreaker...

There are some nice places to drink that you might wanna check out: Pub du Vin usually has some nice wines and ales and isn't too expensive. There's also that Craft Beer place up where the Florist used to be... behind North Road. They have a pretty big selection of quite expensive but extremely delicious beers. Hotel du Vin is near where you're staying and if you can grab the big sofas upstairs, and order a bottle of wine, it can be super cosy and romantic. Oh, and The Bee's Mouth at the end of Western Road is worth a visit too - again, great selection of beers and is also a really nice, unusual little place. Maybe all of these places will suck on a weekend though, I don't know. Best idea is probably to wander around until you find somewhere that looks awesome :)

Avoid West Street, particularly at night, although that's near where you're staying. You probably won't be attacked or anything, but I've had things shouted at me walking down there at night and it's just generally unpleasant - there are lots of cheap clubs that spill out onto that road and so lots of drunk angry people staggering around late at night.

I'm thinking he might be captain in a few years (Gerrard -&gt; Agger -&gt; Henderson -&gt; Shelvey) or vice-captain, at least. Every time he gets subbed in, he passes well and doesn't make mistakes. Sure he's playing against tired players, but his technical skills are undeniable.

And Enrique was great against Everton, apart from a few mistakes, like that one mistake that led to the goal. He brought the ball up well and made defence-splitting passes *as a defender*, like that ball to Sterling in the second half. Sure he made a few bad decisions, but overall he was looking great. Held off Fellaini a few times as well.

Downing can go. Not even going to elaborate a lot on this one. He relies a lot on his left foot for an experienced player, and I really have to say that goal with his right foot was a defensive error combined with a fluke. How many times have we seen him fluff easy crosses with his right foot, sending it well wide?

Cole... He was great for Chelsea, I remember watching him play. One of my favourite Chelsea players back then. He had insane technical skills and was quick with his feet. I was really excited when Liverpool got a hold of him, hoping that he might reach his previous form. But he's just utterly useless now.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt;He doesnt track as much as he did, doesnt break a nut to get back or forward.

He's not being asked to break a nut to get forward - but you're right about the tracking back, he's certainly gotten a bit lazier there and it's disappointing.

&gt; I also dont think hes adapting to this new tactic well, and is often the cause of its demise.

2 months ago I would have agreed with you on this, especially after the Arsenal game, but since that game he's been quite good, playing in that deeper role next to Joe Allen. Since then, I wouldn't put him at fault for any goal we've conceded, and there have been games where he's been even better with his passing than Allen; hardly suggesting that he's where our new style fails.

The only performance he's had that I'd classify as 'poor' was Stoke, when pretty much half the team stopped playing their way because Rodgers hadn't sufficiently planned for dealing with Stoke's physicality.

Honestly, the issue isn't Gerrard, it's Gerrard's former position - because that hasn't been replaced sufficiently (which, admittedly, is no easy task when it's Gerrard's shoes you're stepping into). It could well be Shelvey's one day, but he's not at that level yet - and Sahin's much closer to that level, but is still adjusting to the English game.",0,1351825818,null,0,false,0,c6v5jad,t3_12gzzu,t1_c6v5jad,t1_c6v0sg5,null,1430298204,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

And the reason it won't be is because, like smoking tobacco, it's not great for your lungs. Now, imagine if they legalised it, taxed it and let everybody smoke it. Not only would we get more of a burden on the NHS in years to come with people who smoke too much for their own good, we also get idiots who think it will be OK to have a single joint and end up crashing their car into a load of innocent bystanders, like you currently get with alcohol.

Sure, some people can be adults about it. But the general consensus is going the other way, that people really don't care what is good or not for them and will do it anyway, so government thinks about reducing drink-drive limit, thinks about introducing alcohol pricing, raises the age you can buy fags, bans ""legal"" highs, etc., because we as a population (not individuals) are shite at knowing what is best for us.

For comparison, Allen's on ~45k a week, and Shelvey probably will be on something less than that as well. Even Manchester United's Tom Cleverley, who has seen more first-team action than Henderson this campaign, would be on less, and United have the capacity for a much larger wage bill than us.

Henderson's a good talent, but is he an irreplaceable young British midfielder like Jack Wilshere? Definitely not, and Liverpool isn't a club that can afford to pay someone arguably twice the wages they should be getting on a weekly basis for the ~2 years it might take to see Henderson come good.

true,aussie_gecko1892,null,null,"Being non-specific to the game, but I feel that these point are valid, and have been for quite some time (except the Cole bit, I have no comment on that). Gerrard has been overused for the last 2 years, sure he is a good midfielder in some respects, but his history is one of the only things keeping him in this team. He is lazy getting back, he is slow most of the time, and he gives the ball away far too often. 

Suarez has been overused since he got here. Everyone was going on about how bad a player Carroll was and that Suarez is just awesome, but frankly, they are near on the same quality (in very different ways to be true but still). Suarez is just too inconsistent at times, and sure that just comes with being a player, but really we put so much focus on him, we missed Carroll, as we do right now. 

Lucas is by far the most valuable player in our team, he is becoming the new Liverpool icon. Gerrard is not working with the flow and the system we have, and Lucas will be a much welcome return. Sadly Gerrard will still start games until the end of the season but what can you do. 

To do with being outplayed, I really could care less. as Rodgers said, the team has no depth, but he is creating it, and that is what we need. Rodgers is nto trying to win the league in the next 2-3 years, he is building a team that can do it 5 years from now, building a system that Liverpool can stay with and grow from. If we keep improving the way that we are, i have no doubt that within the next few years that the premier league will belong to us. A few bad games are to happen, and frankly, going into this game I didn't think we would win, but it is something to learn from.

Carra has a role to play in LFC right now for sure, but it is not specifically the games he plays in. He is the leader, he and Gerrard, for the future. Carra is a great defender, and he is going his job to pass down his experience down to the others. He is also a great replacement.

Sadly, I never got to see the game, but I do find it hard to fathom that Cole had so much of a bad game that we are saying that he should never put on the shirt again. How bad was he?",0,1351837115,null,0,false,0,c6v7sev,t3_12hfwv,t1_c6v7sev,t3_12hfwv,null,1430299324,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

The way the force is transferred from a little nub that goes back and forth up to the trimmer blades is centered on a little plastic nib, on which an arm pivots. This nib isn't part of the pop up assembly - it's plastic welded on. The entire design of the trimmer is based on this nib being stressed, and eventually it breaks.

true,gazzthompson,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"Decriminalize would be a good ""first"" step, easier to sell to the public but the aim should be legalisation. The benifits of decriminalization with the tax revenue and loss of funds to criminals. 

Also when it comes to burden on NHS, decriminalization would not help at all. Alcohol and tobacco are both some of the most physically dangerous drugs, we all know the cancers and diseases involved. Alcohol costs 3bn a year to treat on NHS, sounds a lot? The tax revenue is 14.6bn . Both of which are much more dangerous than a lot of drugs like cannabis, LSD, ecstasy etc. I would go as far as saying the tax revenue of the ""softer"" drugs would easily displace that of the drugs themselfs and possibly even some if not all of the harder drugs.

Shelvey will turn with the ball and bring it forward when the time is right. Hendo has similar opportunities, but most of the time he chooses to literally pass the responsibility to someone else. 

When he plays deep, this is not as much of a problem because thats his responsibility. However our deep midfielders need to be willing to take the ball from the backline when under pressure. You can see that Joe Allen is more than willing to do this. He always wants the ball, even in tight situations (if only the rest of the team trusted him more often). Henderson is not the same.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"We made an offer for Theo in this last offseason, apparently after agreeing a basic contract with him. Arsenal quoted near £20M and eventually got down to around 10 or 12, IIRC. LFC were thinking in the range of £4-6M.

Theo used the Liverpool contract offer to try to get more out of Arsenal, which they refuse to do, so he turned them down. I believe Arsenals final offer was their cap of £85k. Huge risk for Arsenal to go into the last season of his deal without either selling him or re-signing him.

I'd happily sign Theo - I just hope we aren't doing the crazy wage thing. I would like to stick to no new signings on anything above £60k. Theo wouldn't accept that, though.

Arsenal will still want £8M or so in January. We should just sign a pre-deal with him then and be done with it until next year. His contract will be at least £20M, we can't afford to add another £8M or so on that just to bring it forward 6 months.

We have been trying to offload Cole before BR joined. I always knew that BR's talk about Cole and 'recalling' him to the squad was all hot air. He did the same with Acquilani (as did Kenny), which lead a lot of nieve fans to actually believe that he had a place in the squad. I can't see any way that we can get out of the rest of Cole's deal.

This might be less of an issue for an Australian as you don't have the language issue, and our societies are probably fairly similar, unlike the Chinese students who I think often get intimidated by trying to join a group of foreign people in a new place and a new language. Also, as you say, many people in England find Australian accents cool, and (depending how you fit the stereotype) if you can drink them under the table they will accept you as one of their own.

I think the most important thing to make sure you can make friends and have fun is to spend time in the communal areas, join societies, sports team or just hang out with your flat. If it does turn out you get a flat of people you don't get on with, it isn't difficult to find other people you can get on with, there are people of all types at Lancaster, and everyone wants to make friends.

In regards to colleges at Lancaster, they are all largely the same, other than the type of accommodation each offers, but a quick pros &amp; cons for each college:

* Cartmel &amp; Lonsdale are both on 'South-West Campus', so a ~5 minute walk to 
your lectures but also a little bit isolated from the main campus.
* Cartmel &amp; County both have catered accommodation so a fairly cheap place to get food if you don't feel like cooking some days, other food places are scattered around the campus near other colleges.
* Fylde is seen as a 'sporty' college, with some success over the years, although any student can join any of the Uni sport teams.
* Furness &amp; Bowland are right in the middle of campus, so a very short walk to lectures.
* Grizedale has some of the newest accommodation on campus.
* Pendle I can't think of anything it stands out for, but its bar is pretty nice and is right next door to Central, a small food shop.

The BBC's response (admittedly after a rather poor start) has been to show a documentary asking how the BBC could get it so wrong, launch two internal inquiries and agree to work with police to uncover the full extent of what went on.

Compare and contrast with the Catholic church's response to the various child-molesting scandals in Ireland (of which I'm sad to say there has been more than one). The Irish government has openly admitted that things went very wrong, apologised profusely to those affected and passed laws that essentially state ""if you learn about someone molesting children and you don't report it to the authorities, you are also guilty of a crime"".

Has the Catholic church responded by supporting this law, turning in kiddie-fiddling priests and establishing an office tasked with the job of rooting out such evil in the church and preventing a recurrence?

He knew what this season was going to be like, and he could have transferred to literally any team in Europe, so what did he do? Sign a new, long-term contract. Furthermore, I really don't think he's the ""only one that wants to win"". Sure, he has the highest work rate of any player I know (on our team or otherwise), but I don't think you can say Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, etc. don't want to win every single game. Finally, I agree with what has been said regarding transfers. FSG realizes that it f*cked up the Dempsey thing, and I hardly think that they're going to allow their massive investment in the club to lose value due to stinginess in a time of serious need.

There seems to be mixed feelings about Theo Walcott with most of the concern essentially coming down to, 'Is his talent [or lack thereof depending on whose side you're on] worth the fee and the wages?'

I personally see two things:

1. Walcott is only 23-years-old and has tons of experience in the Premier League, seems to have stepped up his game this season, still has room to grow (esp under Rodgers), and is more than capable of scoring and creating goals.

2. Outside of Luis Suarez, Liverpool FC struggles to score goals.

Is Walcott a gamble? Maybe. I don't think he is, though.

The wages and the fee shouldn't be a concern:

* Carroll's wages are off the books and there'll be his transfer fee in the summer.

* Joe Cole and his wages somehow, someway have to go even if that means LFC eating half of his wages to send him on loan somewhere.

* Stewart Downing and whatever his wages are has to go.

* And while I like Jose Enrique, the emergence of young defenders seems to suggest that he's the odd-man out.

I think Walcott would be a good move or at the very least, worth the gamble. We need goals and Walcott has shown that he can score and create them.

true,Shahmat,null,null,"See, the issue with this is that according to Traditional (now called Dissident) Irish republican thinking no killing can be called futile.

An essential part of dissident republican ideology is that at the base of things, Northern Ireland is an anomaly. Their greatest fear isn't being caught, or stopped or the British coming in force. The thing that keeps the dissidents up at night is that people will start to feel comfortable, secure and worst of all, normal.

To them, Northern Ireland can never, *ever* be allowed to be seen as normal. Therefore, any killing, or bombing, or violent activity contributes to a general feeling that something is ill at ease in the Province. This is a group of people who justified a killing of a pregnant nurse in Omagh, right?

The aim isn't to bomb or shoot or stab the British out. It is to keep highlighting, though any available means that Northern Ireland is a gross abnormality. The hope is that one day, people around the world will ""wake up"" and realise this.

To call a single killing 'futile' is thinking too rationally. Like every revolutionary ideology, dissident republicanism relies upon a mystical ""waking up"" whereupon all of their actions previously will bear fruit and a sudden, transformational change will happen.

But I have to say sometimes and especially in the second half versus Swansea he needs to stop trying to meg the defender pressing him when he receives the ball in an advanced position.  Sometimes it comes off and he beats the defender in a fantastic manner but sometimes he needlessly losses the ball and the better option might be to just use his body position, hold the ball, and lay it off.

It was quite frustrating to watch him lose the ball a number of times in the final 3rd with 10minutes to go on Wednesday. 

I feel that maybe if someone in the midfield could communicate in Spanish with him that might happen less.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Brighton are a good team. I think that they've been struggling to score goals of late, but they create plenty of chances and have a rock solid defence. Moreover, they're a good team at home. I'd like to think that we could earn a draw - which would be an excellent result - but after last time, I have decided to fellow my inner pessimist. **2-1 to Brighton**.

Here's the team I think Warnock will play:

---------------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Pearce---Peltier

White---Brown---Austin---Tonge

-----------Varney---Diouf

Substitutes: Ashdown, Drury, Green, Norris, Hall, Gray, Becchio.

I just get the feeling that, after Tuesday's performance, Warnock will give Varney another chance. He's good in the air, but also gives us more movement off the ball; he'll pull centre halves out of their position and comfort zone, whereas Becchio is more static. In turn, this gets Diouf on the ball, which is something Warnock wants. This also prevents Becchio from becoming burned out, which is what I think happened to him last week.

He might well bring Becchio back, in fairness. The Varney prediction is a gut feeling, but Becchio would make us more solid at set pieces, which implies to me that Warnock would start with Becchio if he's hoping to steal a win through a set piece. I've also gone with Brown over Austin because he improves us defensively in midfield, which could be crucial against Brighton, provided that his lack of pace isn't exploited. Warnock also says that Brown is ""good for Austin, at times,"" which would explain a decision to leave Norris dropped on the bench.

In general, the performance against Southampton was good enough to leave the team unchanged, which is what I think we need. If Warnock keeps tinkering with the side, then it might end up hurting us.",0,1351873304,null,0,false,0,c6vd2h6,t3_12i004,t1_c6vd2h6,t3_12i004,null,1430301843,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

One of the first things I read on this site was the saying:  ""Kenny is King, Fowler is God, and Gerrard a Legend.""  I never really understood the Fowler aspect and maybe i still don't, but I got a big kick out of this part of the article: 

""The nadir came during a 3-2 loss in 1999. Robbie Fowler controversially dropped to the Anfield turf after scoring a penalty and celebrated by ""snorting"" the white line along Everton's penalty box, mocking Evertonians who had long sung of his rumored drug habit. As Fowler ridiculed the fans, they howled in derision, the cries a thin attempt to mask their powerlessness. ""

Humans have developmental stages, puberty being the one that we go through as teenagers. Paedophilia is defined as a sexual attraction to prepubescence. So, for example a 50 year old man sexually attracted to a 5 year old boy is a paedophile, this is what we all know. Following so far?

The problem comes with this: every human is different, we all enter puberty at different stages of our lives. I was pretty late with puberty, around 14/15, some people can hit puberty when they're even older than that and others can be very early and hit puberty at 8 or 9 years old.

So a 19 year old woman could be attracted to pre-pubescent 15 year old me which would make her a paedophile, but a 50 year old man could be attracted to 9 year old you and wouldn't be a *literal* paedophile because you're pubescent.

I totally agree with what you're saying: a 30 year old having sex with a 15 year old should not happen and there's a reason we have the age of consent, however labelling a 30 year old that does have sex with a 15 year old as a paedophile is stupid, because if they have sex on November 3rd and the 15 year olds birthday is November 4th that means a few hours later the 30 year old magically *isn't* a paedophile?

The issues of child abuse, paedophilia and people having sex with people under the age of consent are all very distinct individual issues, ones that cannot be lumped together. You're trying to suggest that they're all one issue. They each have their own explanations, reasons for being legitimate issues and reasons for being worthy of discussion; trivialising them all by lumping them together as ""Just don't have sex with underage people"" is... well, it's dumb. 

Jimmy Saville is a shit stain because (if proven) he was responsible for child abuse, nobody sane would ever dispute that. The way your post was phrased in relation to the post you responded to above seems to imply that someone that has sex with someone below the age of consent (even if the law is ludicrous) is just as bad as someone that commits child abuse. I disagree with every part of that.

Nono, like everyone else, I want to have a good life and I try to earn as much as I possibly can. I'm just concious of the fact that I've been very lucky on the employment front, and I want to help others out.

&gt;I have to agree that it seems like the rich avoid tax and keep all their income and the poor just live off the state leaving the middle man to pay for everyone.

I think a big problem is that most rich people and middle-class people see people on benefits as spongers. While there are those that abuse the system, the majority of people on benefits really, really, would work hard if they were given the opportunity. Conversely, we all benefit from rich people putting their money in savings and investments with British banks. These banks provide the capital for British businesses to start up or grow, and without the rich at the top of the economy, everything dries up. 

&gt;Do you not feel that we need a government to physically run the country through?

You'll have to define what you mean by ""run"" and ""country"" before I can answer that one. :)

&gt;In your ideal world who would be in charge?

Absolutely nobody. Nobody would rule over anybody else.

Yes. Yes they do. It is in fact how they work.

Vaccines are weakened or denatured samples of an infectious agent. If done right, it will ""train"" the immune system to recognise the infection, without actually being contagious. As a side effect, since your body thinks the vaccine is actually a dangerous infection, it will sometimes trigger your body's defence systems against infections - namely, fever (heat cooks germs), exhaustion (saves energy for fighting germs), vomiting and diarrhoea (in case the infection came in through your food), etc.

true,hotcod,null,null,"Yep. Just look at the places I point out the fact that what the boy was being beaten for failing to do is not something Islam actually requires any one to do. Thinking about in that regard you can view this as his mother pushing the kid to be part of an ""elite"" group and getting angry that the poor boy wasn't able to live up to her expectations of him. It's clearly stated that he was failing *advanced* classes and they wouldn't be *advanced* if a boy that age was expected in any sense, religious or other wise, to be able to pass them. They'd just be *classes*. 

A child disappointing a parent who expected too much of them? That's a story that has to do with people being people and in this case showing the dark tragic side that can result from that. More over it's a story that means that the religion is very arguably incidental but that flies in the face of the pre-convinced narrative some people seem to have. 

What sad about all this is that taking a minute to google hafiz is all you need to be able to work all this out for your self. That the people are coming here and to criticism at Islam's role in the boy's death with out even bothering to try and understand it. I'm actually a little upset that dispite how sure so many people seeming are that Islam is to blame no one seem willing to challenge this idea that become Hafiz is not required by Islam so Islam couldn't have required the child to be beaten. Even if I might not agree with their argument it would at lest show a willingness to engage directly in proving that Islam is to blame and shows that some one is here to be critical because they think they actually have a solid logical reason to be so.

Firstly, Rose became one with the Time Vortex, left messages for herself throughout time and space, resurrected Captain Jack, and saved Earth by destroying the Dalek fleet. Yes, Martha saved the Doctor, but he then saved the Earth, not her.

So I'd say Martha did less than Rose.

Donna saved everybody from the Daleks by disabling them, so she saved the Universe herself, whereas Amy didn't actually reboot the Universe, the Doctor did that when he flew the Pandorica into the exploding TARDIS. She only brought *him* back.

So while I agree the danger has escalated each time, so the Doctor and his companion/s had an escalating danger to solve/prevent, your attributing each success to the relevant companion isn't necessarily correct.

EDITED to add:

&gt;They're supposed to be ordinary people, not universe saving super beings.

The only two who actually saved the Earth/Universe/reality themselves were far from human when they did it. Rose had the whole of time and space in her head (which would have killed her if the Doctor hadn't sacrificed himself to save her), and ~~Martha~~ Donna became part Time Lord (which would have killed her, if the Doctor hadn't basically wiped out half of her mind).",0,1351884507,null,0,1351887458,0,c6vg2qq,t3_12j0t6,t1_c6vg2qq,t3_12j0t6,null,1430303250,13,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13
