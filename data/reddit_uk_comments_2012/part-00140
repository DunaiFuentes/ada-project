It's all about context. 

Is the comedy coming from the fact that this 'normal' person is now 'black'. Is that the extent of the 'joke'? Because I find that a bit backwards to be honest.

Matt Lucas becoming a black person as a character can be funny. Facejacker can be funny. But these would be funny characters (give or take subjective taste in comedy) with or without non-black people playing them. 

Again: I am not for BANNING anything. If people want to black up: have at it. Go wild. Whatever.

Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them.

I'm gay, and if someone goes around saying ""Faggots are disgusting. It's sick and wrong. You'll all rot in hell."" etc, I'd take offence, and most people could see that's offensive. The way it was expressed is naturally offensive. 

But if someone goes around saying ""I disagree with homosexuality because my God forbids it, I believe we were put on this planet to reproduce."", it informs others of their view in a *peaceful* way, with points of reason to back it up, ultimately expanding our understanding of why that person has that opinion. I don't agree, but I'm not offended and they have the right to express that view. *That's* free speech.

Yeah it's subjective, but the context, meaning behind it, manner it was expressed, intention behind it (was it to peacefully inform others and help people understand each other?) etc all factor in. One is offensive, the other isn't. This guy was blatantly offensive. 

If this was on TV as an advert we'd deem it offensive and want it removed - it goes through a similar process. We can't allow anything to be on TV just because it's not a clear line as to if something's offensive or not.

I think that was his point :P It means, anybody can be a Conservative - you don't need to be rich. As long as you agree with values of aspiration and effort, you should vote conservative.

And yes of course it's political fluff.. it's a party conference. But at least he did use some actual facts and figures which I would love to see fact checked. Reducing national debt by 25%, increasing exports to China/Russia/Brazil and creating a million jobs all sounds good, but of course I want to know if it's all true.

And I absolutely agree that we have great universities and postgraduate studies - I did some myself, in a STEM subject! But we have 50% of 18 year olds who don't go to University - it's important not to forget them so that we don't get so many NEETs. And I'm not saying that we need more graduates - we need to make sure that NOT going to university can be just as valid and sensible a choice as going. Again, the training courses he mentioned to help people prepare for work sounds great but I want to see fact checking.

And with regard to schools, I agree - a lot more hours needed. I went to private school that was 8-4:30, but most days staying until 5:30. Compared to a state school on 9-3:30, I was probably spending an extra two days worth of education per week.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I dunno - I don't really see the point in pursuing an export economy, we should aim to create engineers, to do the design work, the R&amp;D etc. 

We want to be designing the automating systems, not being automated away or working in sweatshop conditions to compete with the power of the machine.

Reducing national debt is good though, although hopefully they won't do too much too fast and destabilise the economy.

I think the problem is that the future is moving more and more in the direction of tech and science, and yet many people don't want to pursue those areas in school - but at the risk of sounding like some right-wing asshole, they just won't find jobs.

The fact is that the old polytechnics have some great tech courses (I was amazed at just how good they are having talked to some of the students on the other reddit thread - I'm doing Physics at a redbrick myself) we need to stop pretending that doing English at Oxford is better than doing Engineering or Comp Sci at a 'lesser' institution because the economy won't indulge such prejudice.

I went to a state comp. and did fine - in fact at Sixth form I had almost one on one tuition as sciences aren't very popular, and the teachers were excellent despite what many people say. I was also extremely lucky to have a very supportive family though which is probably the most important thing.

all this time. I thought...

No.

WILF

But if you take it, you could -

THE DOCTOR

No.

(CONTINUED)

Pause.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

You had that gun. Back in the

mansion. You could have shot the

Master, there and then.

WILF

Too scared, I s'pose.

THE DOCTOR

I'd be proud.

WILF

Of what?

THE DOCTOR

If you were my dad.

WILF

Oh now, don't start.

The Doctor laughs, a little. But Wilfred's struggling,

still holding the gun.

WILF (CONT'D)

But you said... you were told, he

will knock four times. And then

you die. That's him, isn't it,

the Master? The noise in his head?

The Master is going to kill you.

THE DOCTOR

Yeah.

WILF

Then kill him first.

Silence.

WILF (CONT'D)

Don't you deserve it?

THE DOCTOR

Ohh yeah. Isn't that the truth?

Got it in one! I deserve it,

absolutely! I so deserve to live.

Everything I've done, the lives

I've saved, the people, the planets,

every single star in the sky. So

where is it, then? Just once.

Where's the reward?

WILF

Then take it.

THE DOCTOR

And that's how the Master started.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

(pause)

It's not like I'm an innocent.

I've taken lives. And I got worse,

I got clever. Manipulated people

into taking their own. Sometimes

I think a Time Lord lives too long.

(quiet, tired)

I can't. I just can't.

WILF

If the Master dies... What happens

to all the people?

THE DOCTOR

...I don't know.

WILF

Doctor. What happens?

THE DOCTOR

The template snaps.

WILF

They go back to being Human?

The Doctor just nods.

WILF (CONT'D)

They'll be alive? And Human?

Then don't you dare, sir. Don't

you dare put him before them!

(holds it out)

You take it, Doctor. That's an

order. Take this gun.

(more upset)

And save your life. Please don't

die. You're the most wonderful

man. I don't want you to die.

Both staring. Both tearful. Wilf takes the Doctor's hand.

Lifts it to the gun. The Doctor's hand, and Wilf's, on

the cold metal, together. Like an act of faith.

And then:

THE DOCTOR

Never.

He gently pushes the gun back to Wilf. And lets go.

If we assume that (the majority of) people will be raised to understand and believe that marginalizing a group (race, colour, nationality, sex etc.) due to inherent and unchangeable attributes is unacceptable, wouldn't it be possible for those people (I'm thinking decades down the line here) to attend a fancy dress party as a 'stereotypical' member of a particular group? This would be not only because their intention is not to offend but also because the majority of people do not find it offensive to portray yourself as a member of another group in this way. It's just 'not known', if you understand me.

What I'm getting at is: If no-one is racist, would something like this still be 'racist'? If the history if forgotten then why would anyone be offended any more. I'm trying to think of a current example, but... well because we've forgotten that X is offensive, I can't think of an example!

By the by - I'm not excusing this chap at all, I'm just wondering if there will ever be a time when racism is such a distant (idiotic) notion that dressing up in this way won't be considered a terrible thing to do. Having said that, if you've grown up around numerous nationalities and never had any idea of racism thrust on you, then I imagine it might be possible to get to your early 20's and not realise how many people will be shocked that you'd dress this way.

In magistrates courts the individual court should be contacted to see what their preference is. The usual practice is that upon provision of the proof of the death the clerk enters on the register that the defendant has died and that terminates the proceedings.

In the Crown Court formal evidence of death should be given and this can be done through a police officer who identifies the dead body of the defendant as the same person named in the relevant indictment. However in practice this is rare and a certified copy of a death certificate is sufficient.

Prosecutors should inform the court of a defendant death and produce a certified copy of his death certificate. The court should be invited to mark the indictment accordingly and an example of the format can be found in Archbold 3-212 where HHJ Chapman directed the form of endorsement on the Indictment.

Because I don't see ""using make-up to change your skin colour"" as necessarily being the same thing you mean by ""blackface"". I see blackface as a deeply offensive historical stereotype specifically emphasising things intended to make the person wearing it seem ape-like and savage, including clothing and general demeanour. I don't see it as just dressing up as someone who happens to be a different race than you.

You're right, I don't know this person, so I can't say with certainty that there was no racist intent, but you don't know them either and it seems deeply unfair to condemn them based on an assumption, particularly one that casts them in such a bad light and particularly when it was said they did it because they thought the person they were portraying was awesome.

The above will typically make just over 1L of soup. Four carrots, a good sized potato, a chicken stock cube [or your own stock - which I substitute if I've cooked a chicken recently.] and an onion. Not pictured are a lil bit of pepper, mixed herbs and occasionally soy sauce.

So the ingredients purchased should last a while. I store them all in my fridge, which is colder than George Osbornes soul.

It's reddit - there's a sub-reddit for almost anything. In terms of cheep meals to make, /r/frugal /r/ukfrugal are good places to start, I'd imagine.

Right attitude / personality will go VERY far in the industry.

After that, all I can advise is tenacity, audacity, in-person approaches, telephone calls and talk to EVERYONE you can who works in the industry and who can give you advice. Take ANY role in an agency that does what you are interested in and work your way up from there.

I will stop here and deal with this. I don't know the person in question but I don't think their ignorance should be condoned. It shouldn't and I'm more concerned with the cultural racism that made blackface the image most of the Western world outside the U.S. received about black people rather than mincing words about whether a person either hately or subconsciously chose this as an acceptable form of costume. 

&gt; No-one here appears to be defending the ~~19th~~21st century institution, they're defending some guy who apparently wanted to dress up as a famous person they liked for a costume party. 

The word *appears* should be one you take care in making sure is actually the case. Please look up and down the thread and see a bunch of posters saying *well it may be racist but...xyz*, trying to excuse this type of behavior. I'm not British but I know that blackface was [used on British television](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_L9ocEcOm4) fairly recently. And again I have yet to be explained why a white person has to use any type of makeup to accurately portray a black person.

 &gt; would you condemn someone wearing a mask based on the likeness of someone of a different race, or is that different somehow?

Depends on who is wearing what mask. You'll have to give me a more specific example for me to give you a good answer.

It works so effectively at Barca because if you let Messi run at you, its a goal pretty much every time, so what do you do? A couple options. Either you lock a holding midfielder onto him. This usually doesn't work very well because he can just drift out of the hole and leave a massive space for your team to exploit. The other option is to have a CB step to him. Then you get one of your wide players to drift inside, and you get a 2v2 on one side of the field (for example their LB and remaining CB vs. your LW and pinched in RW who is now playing like a striker).

If your false 9 doesn't demand that you prevent him running at you, you can just treat him like a normal 9 who is playing out of position. This is what happened to Spain.

It's worth a read, because it shows how our attack and defence have been doing in relation to other Championship clubs.

By the way, if you're confused about the stat in the middle (and I'm saying this because I certainly was!), I believe that it's saying our defence is just on the right side of ""good but overworked"" (and slightly closer to being formidable at home), while our attack is ""languidly clinical"" (few chances but still scoring - we're the best at that in the league, apparently) and we create more chances at home, but score more efficiently away.

It seems to be true to me, at any rate. I am surprised that so many goals have come down our right side, though: if anything, I think that we have weaker defenders on our left side!

true,BlackSuperSonic,null,null,"&gt; Once again you're making assumptions... how do you know this person is ignorant of the historical institution of blackface?

Maybe I am giving too much credit that someone must not know about its history in order to be so tone deaf and ignorant. But that's just me.

&gt; How do you know, like me, they simply don't consider dressing up as a black person when you're not black to be the same thing, perhaps because saying ""only black people can dress up as black people"" has distinctively racist undertones in itself?

The problem with this statement is that black people are treated certain ways *because they are black*. The racism people like me have to deal with goes with us, however we dress. But a white person can put on some blackface and masquerade as being black without any of the consequences *actual* black people have to deal with. It is the epitome of white privilege. 

&gt; Because skin colour exists? Jesus, you might as well ask why someone portraying a vampire needs fangs, after-all, we wouldn't want to discriminate against the living-challenged. Are you denying that there are physical differences between people of different races that cause visual differences, or are you denying that the point of a fancy dress costume is to look like the thing you're dressing up as? Samuel L. Jackson clearly doesn't have pale, peach-coloured skin, so if you do and you want to look like him convincingly, you can't have it either, at least temporarily.

Where do I begin with this paragraph. Yes, people look different. I have never question that so let's throw that out. Samuel L. Jackson also has very quotable lines and a distinct character and way of talking. So my question is, **why can't white people who want to imitate stick to these plentiful methods and leave the blackface alone?** It is really that simple.

&gt; I'm sorry, but I find your attitude utterly ridiculous. You have the right to be offended by whatever you want, but other people have the right to think and call you an idiot if you're offended by completely non-malicious behaviour because of something other people did with completely different intent at the very least decades ago.

You have to right to call me ridiculous and I have the right to call your statement typical white privilege and ignorance. But make no mistake that this is not *completely non-malicious*. It fits well within the historically racist view of taking the image of black people from a white point of view and doing a shitty job of imitating black people. That is still being done to this day. I just gave you an example that was on BBC less than a decade ago.

&gt; Then why on earth are you able to be specific enough to condemn someone for racism based on a few lines in a forum post on the internet? 

Blackface was in use for more than a hundred years and started in Britain. The fact that I even need to have this conversation about why blackface is racist is dumdfounding. I explained this above.

However, I don't think that Peltier's one to talk about man-management, at least not in terms of getting the most out of your players. I have been rather disappointed with him, although I feel that we haven't seen the real him. His performance against Barnsley was probably up there with his best for Leeds: he looked strong against a team who play their best football down the side he was defending, only got properly beaten once (and pulled the guy's shirt to stop him) and actually got forward, which led to the penalty.

Getting forward is something I expected him to do constantly, as he always did that to good effect when playing against us, yet he has become lost while trying to get forward in previous games: the match against Blackburn is a prime example as we conceded two goals directly from him being out of position.

Curiously, he has looked better at centre half, prompting some people to liken him to a centre half playing as a full back.

No. At the time they didn't think they were being offensive. They thought that black people WERE stupid, WERE lazy. They thought they were telling the truth about the nature of black people.

Why do you want to ""dress as a black person"" at all? Is my ethnicity a costume to you? Do you put me on the same level as a pirate or a vampire? I am not a costume for white people to put on. I am a human being and I deserve to have my humanity respected, not mocked.

Nobody is saying anything about being ""allowed"". Go ahead if you want to. I'm just going to know that you're doing something racist. Like I said above, follow the link if you're actually interested. 

&gt;no one would consider it racist if he painted himself white

""Jean Luc Picard"" is not the same thing as ""generic black person"". Jean Luc Picard is a fictional character. Black people actually exist. You are making a false equivalence.

&gt;The Italian FA has confirmed on its website that the Liverpool striker Fabio Borini has suffered a fractured right foot.

&gt;Borini, who was training with the Under-21 side ahead of Friday's European Championship qualifier with Sweden, went for an MRI scan on Thursday which revealed the injury.

&gt;The news will be a major blow to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who only has one recognised senior striker in Luis Suárez.

&gt;With Andy Carroll on a season-long loan to West Ham, Rodgers is facing a striking dilemma ahead of Liverpool's next match, at home to Reading on 20 October.

&gt;Borini joined Liverpool from Roma in July for a fee of around £10.5m. He played under Rodgers in the Championship with Swansea in the closing stages of the 2010-11 season, helping them claim a place in the Premier League.

&gt;Swansea signed him on loan from Chelsea, who he rarely figured for after joining from Bologna in 2007.

AVB himself has never gotten around to explaining his side of the story either. 

I find it extremely funny/sad that the very 'Sun' that we so equivocally and vehemently disregard in this forum was the reason for a manager getting sacked.

Me, I like the guy. I like his work ethic. I liked his tactical approach. I was hoping he'd get to stick around. I was kinda bugged he went to the Spuds but, then again, if players can switch allegiances across rivalries, why not managers?

Bring up the cases of the other one too if you want, but why does it have to be a ""Yeah but what about X?"" tangent?

I note from your link that the Irish slaves are ""forgotten"". If they weren't forgotten, and there was a specific way of dressing (let's say a particular hat that Irish slaves were forced to wear) and someone dressed like that, for example in Belfast on St P's day, do you see that people might get irked? The gentlest way of phrasing it would be: ""Not very sensitive"".

Of course the appropriate reaction is required - I agree that the ""ARGH RACIST!"" reaction that some people might have isn't the best idea, particularly considering that other young black people aren't from 'the generation' (as it were) that would have been denigrated in this fashion.

You don't get upset by someone dressing up as a Leprechauns on St P's day: OK. Good. But why though do you think it's all about you, and how *you* feel? Of course your opinion matters, but just because you're not annoyed by it doesn't mean other Irish people aren't. Give me a short time and I imagine I can find some Irish people who get upset/offended by people dressing in green dungarees and ginger wigs. You can too, if you want, there's nothing stopping you. 

Then again, was dressing as a Leprechaun used to lampoon Irish people in the popular media while they were being oppressed etc.?

Last year I had a quiet celebration when it became mathematically impossible for us to be relegated - anything else would be a bonus.  In that context, Balotelli was the perfect player:  he was erratic, anarchic, hilarious, a stupid genius who was determined to have fun regardless of the outcome.  He was absolutely one of us.

As it happens, I sort of liked winning the league.  I'd really quite like to do it again.  Suddenly Balotelli looks less like the court jester and more like the potential spanner in the works.  But then he steps up and scores the coolest match-winning penalty you'll see until the next time he does it.  He's got swagger, and he wins with style or else he bursts into flames and takes everyone else with him.

true,DEADB33F,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Holy shit, I went to a cowboys &amp; indians party once and dressed as a red Indian (so did about half the people who attended actually).  
If we known we could have potentially all ended up in jail and had our names smeared across all the seedy tabloid papers we might have dressed up as something else.

The Sioux Indians et al were persecuted to fuck, yet I don't see any calls to have Indian outfits removed from costume stores and burned.

Out of interest, what choices does one have when asked to attend a Cowboys &amp; Indians party? I can only see two, one of which is seemingly deeply offensive as the outfit you're wearing would normally be donned by someone with a different skin pigmentation.

Getting offended over such harmless trivialities is patently ridiculous, no matter the nationality being portrayed.

Whilst living in France I once attended a fancy dress party dressed as a Frenchman complete with beret, stripey jumper and string of onions around my neck.  

Perhaps I should have been arrested that time as well?
Or at least made to do Community service or make a groveling apology. After all, we Brits persecuted the French for hundreds of years (although admittedly it was largely a two way street).

I even know someone who once dressed up as Micheal Jackson for a party.
That has to be the height of racism then, as he's impersonating a black guy who's impersonating a white guy. 
I think he hired an actual costume from a shop. Maybe they should be shut down for promoting racism...  I'd imagine they also had red Indian outfits, and maybe even leprechaun ones.

Family life is not sitting around watching X Factor. Homework gives me a chance to have some really interesting conversations with my kids.

She ended up learning about plate tectonics, continental drift, Japanese architecture, the British political system, the chemistry of carbon and a bit of Roman theology. It took 3 hours, 4 pints of cider and numerous requests (from her) that we get back on topic, but we did eventually come to the conclusion that the only noteworthy event on that date was in fact the birth of my daughter.

As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them.

As a result, the moderators of /r/DoctorWho have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker Media properties until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity. We thank you for your understanding.

true,penguinland,null,null,"The reboot (starting in 2005) can be enjoyed fully without seeing the old show. I've only watched seasons 1 and 16 of the old show, neither of which really drew me in. 

The tl/dr, as I have it: the Time Lords and the Daleks fought a Great Time War (sometime after season 16). Both sides ended up losing due to something done by a Time Lord called the Doctor. The war is somehow ""time locked,"" meaning we can't revisit it. The Doctor is the only surviving Time Lord (this is a simplifying lie).

Everything else is explained in Series 1 (from 2005), but if you want to start with Series 5, here's that summary: 

- The Doctor travels in a time machine/spaceship called the TARDIS, which looks from the outside like a blue phone booth, but is much bigger on the inside. 

- He has a sonic screwdriver that looks like a wand with a light on the end. Despite its name, it can lock and unlock doors, scan for interesting things, and other miscellaneous stuff. 

- He also has a piece of psychic paper. It can display credentials that let the Doctor talk his way into places he could not otherwise go. It can also sometimes receive messages from others.

- When the Doctor has been lethally wounded, he can regenerate into a new body with a new personality (this is how the show can change which actor plays the Doctor). It involves a lot of golden dust coming out of his hands and face. ~~When the Doctor regenerates, the TARDIS also rebuilds/reorganizes itself.~~ _edit: the TARDIS' rebuilding itself is independent of the Doctor's regeneration; my mistake._

- The Doctor picks up human companions from early 21st century Earth and goes on adventures with them. Just before Series 5 starts, the Doctor's previous companion permanently left him, and he regenerated into a new body/personality. That's why it's such a good place to start if you want to skip previous episodes.

- River Song is another time traveler, and she and the Doctor keep meeting in the wrong order. River usually knows about the Doctor's future, but refuses to talk about it. 

- The weeping angels are beings that, when you're looking at them, turn to stone through quantum-something. When you turn your back, though, they are deadly fast, and tend to zap people back in time.

- A handful of Daleks survived the Time War, and have been slowly rebuilding their empire.",0,1350015591,null,0,1350059222,0,c6l9ykv,t3_11cedu,t1_c6l9ykv,t1_c6l928e,null,1430127115,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

Somebody commented after the Norwich game that ""Assaidi was all like, 'Pass it to me!  To me!' and everybody else was like, 'Chill dude, we have won.'""  That for me is a great example of Assaidi's attitude.

Watching him play, I get the feeling that no matter the score- up 8-0, down 8-0, or deadlocked in a tie- Assaidi will want the ball, and will want to run and take defenders on, deliver crosses, take shots, find good passes.  That's the kind of player you want on your team.

Too much of this kind of aggressive hunger can be a bad thing: sometimes such a player can try to do too much.  But in Assaidi's case I get the impression that if he sees that it's not on to beat the man, he won't beat the man.  If the cross isn't on, he won't cross.

I know none of the other iconic British comedy series have been remade even after decades passing and Blackadder is hopefully no exception. Maybe a spin off or a show that heavily uses it as it's inspiration. 

And yes, all that was *really* wishful thinking because sadly there are many series (personally like Doc Martin for example) that have gone on for many, many seasons and sort of have passed their prime. I'm glad Blackadder is as long as it is now. We might have gotten a few more seasons/episodes/specials but if they were going to be bad then I wouldn't be inspired to even write about it all you know?

I like it that you described it all as beautiful harmony because I agree with you. It was indeed a beautiful time to be in television and those individuals were perfect and in a way in the right place at the right time. That's the nice type of feeling I got reading Stephen Fry's autobiographies anyway. I suspect comedy will never ever be as fine as it was then.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"I don't think I necessarily see the contradiction as you set it out above.    The individuals right to free speech should cover the right to be an obnoxious, offensive, aggravating wanker.  For the law to step in an imprison someone on this basis opens up a can of worms regarding the level of offense that is tolerable, whose offence is valid and whose isn't and many other imponderables.  What we have seen lately is a sentencing policy based on the judges interpretation of the hurt feelings of some real or imagined majority and it seems to be sailing dangerously close to the rule of the mob (literally, in the case of the man hounded for making a tasteless joke about a missing girl).  It is possible to hold this view without necessarily extrapolating it to say that all people should be free to say whatever they want ever.

It all comes down to proportionality - Individuals, certainly in the cases that have been reported recently, have limited reach and influence and no matter what they say it is unlikely to have much impact on wider society.  Newspapers, religious organisations and other business are capable of having a much broader reach with what they say and it is often broadcast in a very public sphere. In these cases, it may be right to have some codes and standards for what is considered appropriate discourse - I'm not sure I agree with that, but I certainly think it's possible to hold both positions and be consistent.  In fact, I would say that more contradiction exists in the current situation, where a relatively harmless individual can be deprived of their liberty, but organisations are all but immune to censure, save from the snapping of some toothless watchdog or regulator.

All argument around free speech fall into the trap of seeing it as a binary - either you're for free speech or you're against it.  Ultimately, the concept of truly unbounded Free Speech simply doesn't exist in any society, even those which refer to it constitutionally - Libel, hatespeech, the old canard of shouting fire in a theatre are all limits to free speech that everyone accepts.

We're in a recession. Jobs are in short supply. Is this a surprise to anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past three years?

&gt;You would think that most people would tell Subway to piss off.

Why would you think that? Most people have bills to pay and don't want to live on benefits until things 'get better'.

&gt;That people are competing for such low wages makes me wonder if the national minimum wage (and the living wage you quoted) are actually realistic.

People are competing for any wage. They have little choice to do so as this is a requirement to receive unemployment benefits (specifically JSA, which most are on). 
&gt;For example, that website you linked, states that the national living wage is calculated based on people's needs (the cost of living). i.e. the demand for labour.

How are you equating people's needs with the demand for labour? I still need to eat, sleep somewhere warm, wash, pay my bills etc. regardless.

There's an explanation on how the figure was calculated here;

Shocking comparison, I appreciate, but a valid one in enabling serious discussion on the issues raised. 
 
In the latter case, the conscience of the doctor is protected in law: the abortion act of 1967 carried a conscientious objection clause. The evidence from gay rights legislation so far is that such clauses are not included, and that individual conscience is not recognized in the implementation of such laws. 

As to the more general point raised, that the act of same sex marriage has ""no direct effect on anyone else"", that rather begs the question as to, why, if it's true, people are campaigning for a change in the law. It cannot be to merely confer legal rights, since they can already be granted in a civil partnership. Nor can it be merely for the sake of a ceremony, which same sex couples are already free to take part in, with no legal basis. The point of the proposed change is, in some measure, to change the perceptions of other people - the public at large.

The simple fact is that many British people do not want to be told what to think and believe by the state about such a fundamental issue.  Nor do they want their children to be educated (some would say indoctrinated) to subscribe to this particular view. It is to protect this right to think and act differently that some are arguing against the proposed redefinition of marriage in the UK.

&gt;How are you equating people's needs with the demand for labour? I still need to eat, sleep somewhere warm, wash, pay my bills etc. regardless.

I wouldn't say that I'm equating people's needs with labour. I think what I tried to say was that the degree to which an individuals needs are fulfilled depends upon the value of one's labour.

What we consider to be our needs, are entirely subjective based on our expectations of living standards. So for example, an unskilled worker in India may have his expected standard of living provided by a wage of £7.20 a day, in that it permits him to have food, water and a makeshift home, whereas an unskilled worker in the UK requires significantly more, because his expectation of living standards includes a three bed house for his family, a car, and a holiday abroad every year.

The problem is that, as the fulfillment of our needs depends on our wages, and our wages typically depend on our competitiveness with other local individuals, as well as the competitiveness of our employers in the global markets, the degree to which we can meet our needs is variable, and hence our expectations should be, which is why having a fixed wage based on estimated needs alone seems unrealistic.

Admittedly there's been some unrest recently, but there is zero possibility of another military coup. They will stay free and democratic no matter what, because of the larger structure they belong to.

It also rehabilitated central and eastern Europe. No less than nine former communist states have been persuaded to join and are now free and democratic. All the non-EU candidates (Ukraine, Russia) are not.

Turkey is far nicer place than it used be. The army stays out of politics these days. The Kurds and other minorities are being treated reasonably. All thanks to EU negotiators banging on about human rights during 30 years of talks.

NATO, on the other hand, was merely an anti-Soviet club. Anyone who didn't like the USSR could join. There's no North Atlantic Court of Human Rights, nor a requirement on NATO members to respect them.

These people either are being subsidised by the government or more likely their parents. 

They'll make (assuming 4 days a week at 8 hours a day as there has to be a release day every week) £4,810. A low estimate of the cost of a room in a shared house, a really low one actually if they were living independently, would be £70 p/w (someone under 35 without children has fuck all chance of getting social housing) which is about £3,600. That would leave approx £20 p/w for transport, food, heat and electricity. Not factoring in things like clothing, household items or any sort of social activity. Could you live on £20 a week, most weekly bus tickets are more than that.


 So unless his parents are subsidising him by giving him reduced board or the government is by giving him LHA there is no way someone can live on that money even if it is just to provide the absolute minimum of existence in this country.

I was doing work basically related to apprenticeships in an old job and I had to keep abreast of things and went to some National Apprenticeship Service conferences and the like and this value depreciation of apprenticeships was acknowledged as a huge problem and something I thought the government were looking to tackle. They clearly aren't.

You get an apprenticeship in engineering, or plumbing and so on and you are pretty much guaranteed it's a good one because you have to be able to do certain things, yet a level 2 customer service apprenticeship is technically worth the same as a level 2 engineering apprenticeship. Which is absurd.

Some others like certain IT and communications and a wide range of others are too variable and there is almost not control over quality and depend completely on the employer (and to a much less extent on the training provider). So you can get really first rate apprenticeships which will lead into established jobs at that company or as some people pointed out below complete shit jobs where they aren't teaching you anything and just getting you to paint walls while doing an IT apprenticeship.

Then there are the real pointless ones, the customer service ones, retail ones and  the whole range where there is no need for it as it can easily be done with a couple of days training and on the job training. There is no reason for an average shop worker to need an apprenticeship. 

It's costing the government money, giving people a useless qualification in return for lower wages and devalues apprenticeships completely.

Working class unemployment is a result of British business's inability to compete on a global scale. We can't compete because our workers expected living standards are above what the markets can provide them with, and as a result, they demand more renumeration than they are worth.

We actually do compete, it is a struggle but to suggest the UK isn't competative is wrong, what is right is that in like for like manufacturing jobs (although there aren't many of these) British mainly working class workers can't compete.

Working class unemployment isn't down to an uncompetitive. German and Scandanvian standards of living are just as high yet they compete very well. In the UK it is down to poor policies from Thatcher and her 'let them live on benefits' attitude onwards that have systematically made working class unemployment worse. A proper education and re-training culture would really help, improvements to benefit systems, and guaranteed work schemes and general financial stimulus to improve the economy. The problem is on this matter the government did not make hay while the sun shined.

Actually rising wages in China are literally now becoming important and due to the fact we have much higher productivity in a lot of areas due to and lots of production is coming back to the EU (inc the UK) and US in certain areas because technology and high foreign wages are making it cost effective to make here.


We are also incredibly competitive in certain areas but like all manufacturing in the western world, technology has removed the need for the vast swathes of workers. The car factory that employed over 30,000 workers in the early 80s now needs less than 5,000 and produces more kind of thing.

Also you forget the point that high standards of living and high wages/consumption is what is allowing China etc to grow. Without our high wages they don't have customers.

This is a good point, but there isn't enough demand for these sort of jobs to sort out the unemployment problem (unfortunately).

&gt;German and Scandanvian

Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Norway enjoy a high quality of life because they possess large amounts of natural resources while having low populations. Norway, for example, has 1% of the world's known oil reserves with just 0.0007% of the world's population.

Germany's economic growth is based on lending money to 'fringe' eurozone countries like Italy, Spain and Greece, who in turn buy cars and manufactured goods back from Germany. The German economy is going to get wiped out if the Euro collapses.

&gt;The car factory that employed over 30,000 workers in the early 80s now needs less than 5,000 and produces more kind of thing.

This is a catch-22. On the one hand, this means that automotive workers lost their jobs. On the other hand, reduced production costs (coupled with competition from other manufactuerers) reduced the price of cars, making them more available to workers in un-related sectors. This is actually a good thing.

&gt;Also you forget the point that high standards of living and high wages/consumption is what is allowing China etc to grow. Without our high wages they don't have customers. Which is why China went through a proper crisis a few years back and millions of unemployed were forced to return back to the country as thousands of factories shut down due to loack of US and European demand.

I think this is probably the best argument I've heard today. As a result of this, and the obvious fact that it's an unsustainable flow of wealth from West to East, Eventually there will be an 'equilibrium point' where wealth and standards of living are comparable between England and China, and this regional exploitation of price difference is infeasible.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; …  the institution is riddled with corrupt and lowlife cops, there are also plenty of good and moderate cops, … 

I'd believe the latter half of that statement, if the ""good"" and ""moderate"" cops were actually doing something about their bent colleagues.

From my personal experiences, and depending on how you count them, about 20% - 50% of police are bent or otherwise criminally complicit.

We certainly count the first cop who blatantly lied about the events, but it's really interesting that a copper who ""seemed really nice"" up until that point, how she opened her mouth, hesitated, cleared her throat and then backed up her buddy with another falsification. 

I think we should probably blame the booking sergeant, who could have separated the two officers and asked them to recount in just a little detail what exactly transpired. Had he done so it would have been impossible for him to conclude that the officers were telling the truth, because they had no opportunity to collude and they would have inevitably recounted differing fabrications. 

The same goes for the duty inspector, who walked out on the arrestee when he tried to ask for this kind of help, failing to uphold his duty of care for a member of the public, and  letting his officers get away with a crime. Because he refused to listen to a citizen in distress.

We can blame the court system, too, if you like, because a magistrate listening to a ""he said, she said"" talk involving a couple of police officers and a civilian, well, I think it's pretty evident who's guilty here. 

But we really shouldn't have to go that far up the tree.

Even if you want to pretend that my percentages are wrong - you want to argue the figure that 20% - 50% of cops are bent, because you claim that's ""anecdotal"" - well, you're going to have to conclude that at least 10% of cops are criminal, and that's a staggering proportion. I can't think of any other job or office in which 10% of the workers could get away with crimes.

Can you imagine an office in which 10% of the blokes thought it was OK for them to pinch the bums of their female colleagues? Can you imagine if 10% of your coworkers were stealing from your employer? Of course not! The idea is ridiculous, but that's the rate at which cops are falsifying evidence. 

It's simply not credible that some tiny minority of police officers are corrupt and they're prosecuted whenever they're found out. That is a fiction that perhaps suits some people, perhaps most of all those who have practically no contact with the police ever and who simply feel more comfortable with the idea that our cops are good and honest. Police officers see the crimes of their fellow officers on a daily basis, and ignore them. That is the fact of the matter, and I'd just have some respect for the institution if some of them were arresting their colleagues for their misdeeds.

If you doubt this, I can only suggest you befriend someone in the trade. Any defence solicitor will tell you what goes on - even a duty solicitor, assigned by the plod to their prisoners, will tell you ""yes, the police lie, and there's nothing you can do about it.

Scum who commit crimes ruthlessly and scum who accept that and cover their colleagues asses out of brotherhood.

&gt; But we really shouldn't have to go that far up the tree.

Agreed. This is a systemic failure to apply logic vs emotion to a criminal prosecution. Right the way through to the defending lawyer (if one was allotted) who should have recommended not guilty.

&gt; The idea is ridiculous, but that's the rate at which cops are falsifying evidence.

I'm not going to call out your logic for being forced to be anecdotal, i have personally experienced anecdotal evidence myself. But the nature of covert work means it remains anecdotal. I know for a fact the institution is rotten, and it seems the police service acknowledges its failure, covertly. But the culture prevails where its accepted as a necessary evil to the greater good. 

This doesn't placate me, i have a strong dislike for the institution, but i continue to respect the individuals who work for it, unless i encounter otherwise that percentage of scum who make themselves apparent. No offensive term for them does justice to the extent of crime they commit. Fucking filth, scum of the fucking earth.

That said, those two cops who died? I heard their epitaphs at their funerals, they sounded like real fucking Class-A stand up citizens and i know the force was proud of them. Couldn't think of two individuals who deserved that tragic injustice less. As Robert Peel said the police are the public and the public are the police.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The first success was rehabilitating Germany after the War. Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece all used to be military dictatorships. Now happy, prosperous, modern democratic states. Admittedly there's been some unrest recently, but there is zero possibility of another military coup. They will stay free and democratic no matter what, because of the larger structure they belong to.

You appear to be glossing over the fact that Greece is currently in the throes of economic collapse because it isn't allowed to leave the single currency system, and all because of political pride. I see what you did thurrr. Portugal is a hot bed for drug dealerships and criminals, and Barcelona currently wants independence from the rest of Spain *because* its citizens want to leave the EU.

&gt;It also rehabilitated central and eastern Europe. No less than nine former communist states have been persuaded to join and are now free and democratic. All the non-EU candidates (Ukraine, Russia) are not.

Yes. The people's republic of New Poland thank the members of the Eastern block for coming to our shores, and reminding us that it is neither logical nor correct to want to be so multicultural, or to want to be called the UK. We also thank Eastern Europe for the introduction of Krokidil onto our streets, an increase in gang related crime, and completely devaluing the job market by not *only* being willing to work exponentially cheaper than the average new polish citizen, but creating a negative economy by sending what little money they earn back home, and into the pocket of bent landlords. Eastern bloc, we salute you.

&gt;Turkey is far nicer place than it used be. The army stays out of politics these days. The Kurds and other minorities are being treated reasonably. All thanks to EU negotiators banging on about human rights during 30 years of talks.

Yes, it's a wonderful place if you ignore the fact that they still illegally occupy half of an island that's Greek sovereign territory, have an atrocious human rights record and zero tolerance for gender equality.

&gt;NATO, on the other hand, was merely an anti-Soviet club. Anyone who didn't like the USSR could join. There's no North Atlantic Court of Human Rights, nor a requirement on NATO members to respect them.

They not got any real quality control (employers are not happy about this and one reason why some are very reluctant about apprentices) and the incentives for businesses can be pretty perverse and are kind of in a 'we must do something, this is doing something, therefore we are doing what we must do' kind of attitude and ignoring all the evidence that shows what they are doing isn't working.

They think apprenticeships are good and that increasing the number of apprenticeships is good. It would be if a) the quality in the qualifications were there and it simply isnt in too many and b) the quality of the apprentices was better.

It's too often now seen as some panacea for who have failed in standard education whereas good apprenticeships should be for those who want to and can do the work. 

A woman I worked with who worked in employment and training for people social housing took an apprentice on and after 4 months or so she kept calling in sick and then went on persistent long term sick leave and it sounds harsh but she was clearly faking it, I left before it all got resolved but i think she got fired after as her doctor refused to keep signing her off sick. She'd inherited a culture of worklessness from her parents and getting up and getting to work she thought wasn't worth it despite the fact it would lead into a better job, a better general life. It was so annoying because it was an opportunity now with 4 months wasted when there were others who wouldn't have done that and deserved the chance better.

  I worked a lot with our construction subcontractors who had to hire apprentices as part of their contract as well as the local college business representatives and they all had similar stories. Apprentices just not showing up, behaving poorly on site etc and having to be fired after a few months wasting everybody's time. Lots of good stories as well but too many bad ones. 


Over 18 apprenticeships are increasing a bunch but after 18 employers are liable for half the cost of it. These are better apprentices, they are more reliable etc often people they employ and trust yet the business gets penalised with a £5k+ bill for employing them as an apprentice as opposed to a . There are too many shit 16-17 year olds who really sour lots of employers to apprenticeships.

--------------Allen----------Sahin----------------

---------------------Gerrard------------------------

---Suso----------------------------Sterling------

---------------------Suarez-------------------------

Keep in mind the midfield three are constantly rotating the triangle so starting position isn't a big indicator as to where Sahin/Gerrard will be. I believe Assiadi deserves a start and would love to see him in place of Suso.

Depending on the fitness of players returning from international I can see the back line having Johnson on the right and Enrique on the left.  Gerrards fitness for the game may also be up in the air after international duty.

How could I start in the middle of a show? 

But I took his word for it, and I was so glad that I did. Season 5 does a much better job at exposition. When you watch The Eleventh Hour, you do not necessarily get a sense of of *who* the Doctor is, but you *do* get a sense of what he is all about (protecting Earth, being crazy), and what the show is like. It sucked me in as a viewer and I couldn't stop watching. *Then* I revisted the RTD years (Season 1-4) and also enjoyed those, albeit a little less consistently (the quality seemed to waver up and down a lot more in those years).

The trouble with Season 1 is that--in my opinion--it doesn't do as good of a job at exposition or enrapturing the viewer like Season 5 does. And I think starting at Season 2 with Tennant is even more confusing. Narratively, Season 5 starts out fresh. It's very easy to understand what's happening.

That said, we should look at a player like Torres (although NOT Torres) for Suarez to play off of.

Borini can hopefully become that player in a few years, but right now I'm left wondering why we didn't buy Jackson Martinez. He was on our radar and went to Porto for only 7 million pounds.

true,dominicshaw,uk,London,"Truth is you'll never get a completely impartial point of view. Everyone has an agenda. Not sure what you want to know about the EU, but it is simply a trade agreement and has little meaning. Even if we were not in the ""EU"" we would still have free-trade agreements with the rest of Europe (Norway, for instance). It breaks down some of the bureaucracy, and is good by that measure, but it is used politically to justify all sorts of strange things.

The Euro is the most important issue in Europe today and the problem there is simply that they let too many (economically weak) countries join. When they started the idea of the euro, which was many decades ago, they came up with stringent entry criteria. However, because when it actually kicked off everything was in ""boom"", they decided to let weak countries (Greece, Slovenia, Iceland, etc, etc) in on the understanding that all countries were only going ""up"", and therefore if they can afford it now, they will always be able to (afterall, everything is going up!). 

Queue the financial collapse, spurred by ""subprime mortgages"" in America. This basically means that banks gave mortgages to people who couldn't afford them. This gets more complicated because when a bank grants a mortgage, it is regarded as safe debt, and therefore they can leverage against it - this means that they can lend money against the value of the mortgage - often more than the value of the mortgage since they can be fairly sure that ""not all mortgages will fail at once"" - but, you know, they kinda did.

So America's economy was badly hit, and we were doing the same, so so was ours, but mostly, trade with America was down so we got less cash. So now we are in trouble because of our own subprime mortgage crisis and lack of trade with America. Europe is pretty down because of the same, and far worse: they can't adjust their own currency to make themselves more attractive to investors / trade partners.

In the UK we have spent the last few years de-valuing our currency. This is bad for the individual in that our savings/salary are worth less, but it is better for business (the most important kind of business - international - that which brings money into the UK) - therefore, is good for the UK - even though it doesn't feel that way.

The EC can't do that - they are one currency - they have to all agree - imagine that - getting all the constituent states to agree to anything - having countries as different as Greece and Germany agree on anything on a fiscal level is quite unlikely.

I say all this because Europe is a) the biggest economy in the world and b) our biggest trade partner - it really matters what happens there.

For the UK - I think it is hard to make a rationale and impartial evaluation because we are in it, but I think that the conservative government tempered by the liberal democrats have come up with sensible fiscal and social policy designed to cut our debt and not halt growth (or at least not reverse it). I think the go too far in some social policy - too far to the right - but perhaps not far enough with some fiscal policy, but that is my own politics.

That's the way you use personally reddit, but it is by no means the only way, my last username was getting in the way of discussion, so I changed it. It doesnt matter what it was. You can delete posts, you can delete accounts. How you use this place is up to you.

US, Marshall plan. More to do with West Germany being in the Western spehere of influence after the war. As well as the brilliant work nation building after the war. Very little to do with the EU. Now has the EU continued to help Germany rebuild east germany, absoloutly. the EU has helped rehabilitating half of Germany but it's very much been built on the framework laid by (principally) the US in the aftermath of the war.

&gt;Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece all used to be military dictatorships. Now happy, prosperous, modern democratic states

Nothing to do with the EU (unless someone can teach me)

&gt;It also rehabilitated central and eastern Europe. No less than nine former communist states have been persuaded to join and are now free and democratic. All the non-EU candidates (Ukraine, Russia) are not.

More to do with the collapse of the soviet union than anything the EU, but the EU has had a role in their recovery. 

&gt;Turkey is far nicer place than it used be. The army stays out of politics these days. The Kurds and other minorities are being treated reasonably. All thanks to EU negotiators banging on about human rights during 30 years of talks.

Are you crediting the EU with the liberalisation of Turkey? It's always been more secular than it's neighbours, even as far as 1924 there was no state religion.And in 1981 they had a very modern constitution written guaranteeing peoples freedom.

Would just like to add while the EU didn't forge the peace, it will probably keep it. Consider NATO as the scaffolding that kept everything in place while the EU was being built. It's now strong enough to last without the scaffolding.

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"&gt; As to the more general point raised, that the act of same sex marriage has ""no direct effect on anyone else"", that rather begs the question as to, why, if it's true, people are campaigning for a change in the law. It cannot be to merely confer legal rights, since they can already be granted in a civil partnership. Nor can it be merely for the sake of a ceremony, which same sex couples are already free to take part in, with no legal basis. The point of the proposed change is, in some measure, to change the perceptions of other people - the public at large.

You might as well ask why, in the USA last century, were black people opposed to the segregation on public transport? Why care that white people sat at the front, and black people at the back, when they're both still riding the same bus? If it's really the same, why continue with the distinction?

&gt; The simple fact is that many British people do not want to be told what to think and believe by the state about such a fundamental issue. Nor do they want their children to be educated (some would say indoctrinated) to subscribe to this particular view. It is to protect this right to think and act differently that some are arguing against the proposed redefinition of marriage in the UK.

Again, with an example from living memory, many people were opposed to interracial marriages (some probably still are). Is it considered a result of indoctrination that most people now are accepting of it? Is it not also the case that to argue against gay marriage on religious grounds also stems from childhood indoctrination of the opposite view? I'm also British, and myself and most people I know are not opposed to this change. The ""indoctrination"" in this case seems to be a negative word thrown about when people don't like the change that's happening in society. Given that the past century has seen a tidal wave of change in society for equality for women and other races, different sexualities seem like a natural part of that change, and in no way some kind of forced indoctrination.",0,1350057548,null,0,false,0,c6lg771,t3_11avqk,t1_c6lg771,t1_c6lcwcs,null,1430130122,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

(We live in the middle of bloody nowhere by the way, and shrieking barn owls are quite common). Open door, shine torch - noise stops - no sign of cats in the garden or owls on the roof. Back inside. Noise re-starts. We listen for a bit. It's *close* - sounds like it's *right* outside the front door. Open door again, and we both emerge this time for a look round. Just before going inside I hear a rustle in the bushes beside the door &amp; shine the torch, in time to see a bloody great big rat disappearing into the bushes.

Remember that rape needs both the physical act, and the lack of consent to be proven. In Ched's case, proving lack of consent was trivial; they were able to show that he didn't even try and get her to consent. In the case of the footballer found innocent, there was reasonable doubt; he'd built a case that backed his assertion that he had waited until she consented, and, given that it was her word against his, and he'd got circumstantial evidence that he wasn't lying, the BRD position is that he might have obtained consent, so not rape.",0,1350058139,null,0,false,0,c6lgcou,t3_11brkz,t1_c6lgcou,t1_c6l4nl8,null,1430130198,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Start with *Yes Minister* and *Yes Prime Minister*. (Youtube; BBC Iplayer have recently been re-running the radio versions). IMO much of the bullshit they were lampooning is still applicable. Then *the thick of it* for an up-to-date version. I love the thick of it, but while it's spot on at nailing party politics, it has very little to say about *government* - the yes ministers were good at that. 

""Yes Minister"" (or it may be YPM) has a good episode about Europe being ""a game played for national interests"" which at the time was fairly revealing, as politicians, portrayed by Jim Hacker, liked to pretend they believed in ""the European Ideal"". This was actually always nonsense; these days we kind of know it without having it pointed out to us.

(I'm not knocking the EU by the way, I'm broadly speaking a supporter of it. But we should be realistic about what it is, and why we're in it).

Of course, you can actually *learn* more from Wikipedia or a decent textbook. But the satire will give you enough insight and cynicism to make some sense of what you subsequently read. For god's sake don't start with a studious work into the history of the labour party, you'll lose all interest in ever reading again.

EDIT: Even without the war, just having an inkling of future history in general would probably help. Wash a few dishes at a restaurant, invest the money in GM, profit.

Hi everyone,
I've been talking with a few people about a few ideas we have, and this is what we have so far:
1) The show is pretty much decided on being named 'The REDdit Podcast'
2) It will be recorded on a Google Hangout, then published to YouTube, as that has the widest audience, but it may be published to iTunes too, if possible.
3) We may or may not have video elements to the show eg. showing diagrams for suggested formations.
That's all for now, but it's still early days. I've also had an idea of letting everyone on the subreddit, that wants to be on, on as a guest at some point, to show that there's a sense of community in this, and that it's not just that we are the hosts, the 'Stars' if you would like, and you are the listeners, we want to show togetherness, like real Liverpool fans. Anyway, that's it for now, I'll report back in a few days :)

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"There's a bit by Joan Rivers which sticks in my head every time I hear about someone being offended by a joke. It's in the middle of the documentary on her, [A Piece of Work](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568150/). 

I've taken this from some subtitles I've found, so it might not be 100% accurate. She's in some club in Nowheresville, Idaho, and tells a joke that an audience member gets offended at:

- **Joan:** The only child that I think I would have liked ever was Helen Keller because she didn't talk.

- **Audience Member:** Not very funny.

- **Joan:** Yes it is. And if you don't think so, then leave.

- **Audience Member:** It's not very funny if you have a deaf son. 

- **Joan:** I happen to have a deaf mother. Oh, you stupid ass. Let me tell you what comedy is about.

- **Audience Member:** You go ahead and tell me what comedy's about.

- **Joan:** Oh please, you are so stupid. Comedy is to make everybody laugh at _everything_, and deal with things, you idiot. My mother is deaf, you stupid son of a bitch. Don't tell me.

- **Audience Member walks out**

- **Joan:** And just in case you can hear me in the hallway, I lived for nine years with a man with one leg. Okay, you asshole? And we're going to talk about what it's like to have a man with one leg who lost it in World War II and never went back to get it, because that's fucking littering. So don't you tell me what's funny. Comedy is to make us laugh. 9/11? If we didn't laugh, where the hell would we all be? Think about that. Where the hell would we all be?

There's something about this segment that strikes me as what comedy is all about: every single thing is a possible subject for comedy. It only matters if it's funny, that's all. Comedy is there to make us laugh for a little while, and forget that our lives are essentially short and difficult.

true,control_group,null,null,"&gt;The problem is - who decides what constitutes a grossly offensive statement? The government? the police? the media?.

Judges, though of course the public and police are also involved.

&gt;Why should we allow images of the prophet Mohamed when they are grossly offensive to some of our citizens?

The proportion is very small, I'd say not all Muslims are quite so offended as the most strident ones. Anyway, a good test to use might be whether something is universally offensive. I'd say insulting someone's recently murdered friends, relatives or colleagues or making jokes about their missing children would be offensive to *everyone* in society, whereas images of Mohammed wouldn't be.

&gt;What offends me is that the state has assumed the power of being the arbiter of what I should find offensive, so offensive that some young people's lives are being ruined for a moment of childish stupidity.

It's more what the ""common man"" would find offensive. I think most people would find the things outlined (jokes or insults about dead or missing friends or relatives) offensive.

&gt;This kind of draconian thought control is what you'd expect from some tin-pot dictatorship in a small undeveloped country, not from one of the world's oldest and most mature democracies.

I do agree it is a bit heavy handed. Please don't think I completely disagree with you. I think prison is excessive. I also think that although people are offended by things like this, they *shouldn't* be so offended. But they are, and therefore it affects them strongly, perhaps just as strongly as finding their house burgled might affect them. For some people the emotional shock of seeing someone joke about a missing child or murdered friend could be significant, I don't think we can just be totally dismissive of that.",0,1350063026,null,0,false,0,c6lhnj7,t3_11b59z,t1_c6lhnj7,t1_c6l31jh,null,1430130808,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You can either start at S1E1: ""Rose,"" **or** you can start at S5E1: ""The Eleventh Hour. ""

Starting at season one means you don't have to miss a thing. However, while season one is great television, and the 9th Doctor (portrayed by Christopher Eccleston) is absolutely fantastic, the production quality is very low compared to the later seasons, and there are quite a few stinker episodes that have dissuaded a lot of my friends from really getting into the series. 

Starting at season five is my personal choice when it comes to getting new people into Doctor Who. At the end of season four (more or less), the tenth Doctor (David Tennant) left, as did all of his previous companions. In addition, there was a huge mixup in the show's management - the head writer, Russell T. Davies, as well as the head producers left. Steven Moffat, who had written some of the best episodes of the previous seasons (and heads up the extremely fantastic *Sherlock*) took over, and we get Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor, who, at this point, is just as new to this as you are. 

I highly, highly recommend starting from season five of the revival series. You get a new Doctor, a new companion, a new storyline, and a new head writer -- and there is almost zero overlap with the previous seasons, so you're not missing too much lore at all. After you catch up, though, you should definitely go back and watch the 9th and 10th Doctor's stuff.

&gt;Back to Fielding, and he’s now in a narcissistic rage over the whole affair, continuing to repeatedly tweet about MissSpidey, advocating a namechange from “Twitter” to “Cunt Platform”, and talking about how he’s a “horrible boy who likes to pull the legs off spiders.” A fairly lame attempt at contrition is made, before he RT’s a supportive fan, then immediately goes back into “fuck em” mode. Then we get a spot of victim blaming for good measure before, finally, Fielding thanks his followers for the support.

&gt;The support was, as you can see from what he chose to retweet, abusive and insulting towards MissSpidey. She was repeatedly opened up to the hostility of 340,000 followers, many of whom are young girls who worship Fielding and his contrived, try-hard, drippy fucking surrealism. Fielding personally set the tone early on to one of personal abuse, using MissSpidey’s avatar picture to make unflattering remarks about her appearance. This thread was picked up by his followers, but they went further. Much further.

&gt;MissSpidey was swamped by hundreds of mentions, from hundreds of users. These tweets, as I’ve said, mocked her physical appearance as being “old” and “ugly” – in reality, she is neither. Then it took a more sinister turn, and MissSpidey found that her address had been tracked down and was being published by the “FieldMice”, who were also threatening violence. Then she started to receive death threats – Noel Fielding was, as you’d expect, copied in on much of this by the fans seeking his approval, so presumably knew what was going on. MissSpidey tried to counter the avalanche of hostility by using the official mechanisms in place for doing so: she started to block and report the users, eventually ending up suspended from Twitter for “aggressive blocking.” I know, isn’t it?

&gt;MissSpidey suffers from Cyclothymic disorder. Twitter was a vital support network for her. With that suddenly taken away – through no fault of her own – and with a continuing barrage of hateful, hurtful messages being continually delivered to her, MissSpidey lost hope. She tried to end her own life. ",0,1350066832,null,0,false,0,c6liode,t3_11d33c,t1_c6liode,t1_c6lih5y,null,1430131356,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

However, in Singapore, though a tweet or post may lead to outrage (see the recent NTUC racist Amy Cheong facebook post furore) it doesn't lead to a fucking arrest. They're not that stupid. It's also illegal to be gay, but they don't tend to enforce that one either.

Given that the material quality of life (including benefits like an HDB house from the government) is so much better in Singapore, I am now seriously considering that it is now definitively a better place to live than this shithole of a country.

We're alive and well, and... stuck. In New York, fifty years before I was born. We can't come home again. I won't ever see you again, and that breaks my heart. I'm so sorry, dad.  

I thought about this for years, and I realized there was one thing that I could do: I could write to you. Tell you everything about how we lived,   how, despite it all, we were happy.  

But before I do, I need you to know--you are the *best* dad any son could have had. And for all the times I drove you mad, and you drove me mad, all the times I snapped at you... I'm sorry. I miss everything about you. Especially our awkward hugs.  

I bought a trowel, we have a small yard, I garden. *Chuckle*  

But one more important bit of business: the man who delivered the letter, Anthony, be nice to him, because he's your grandson.  

We finally adopted in 1946. Anthony Brian Williams. He can tell you everything; he'll have the family albums. And I realize having a grandson whose older than you is far beyond weird, but, I'm sorry.

Gerrard pre 25 was known more for his power, both shooting and tackling wise (sure he could pass and he was very good at it but that wasnt what he was notorious for). 

It wasn't until around 25-26+ Gerrards passing game really came into force  with the help of Alonso (who I saw first hand drilling Stevie on his passing) and he developed an unmatched balance between his passing/crossing accuracy with his shooting making him a very dangerous player and making him one of the best attacking mids/all round players in the world.

Now Jonjo may not be world class (yet, early days) but he's a spot on mirror of how Gerrard progressed but on a much more developed level, he already has the shooting power, he has the shooting accuracy, he's a great tackler, we know he has good vision, he's can pass and cross well but im expecting him to get a lot better in years to come and more importantly he's fearless...

He's everything the world class Gerrard had and was but on a less experienced/developed level 

ONE MAJOR reason he's not held on the same level as Gerrard's importance yet is because only 21.. he hasn't had the big games to prove it yet, BR knows what he's capable of, wait 5 years and in my honest opinion i will be very shocked if Jonjo is not playing at or surpassed Gerrards level.

Those two seasons were when Captain Fantastic was 25-26 years old, and all stats aside, he dominated the pitch once Alonso came because that is when he was given the opportunity to play a more attacking role.

Literately just read my first comment and it sounds like im making the argument that Jonjo now is better than Gerrard in 05-06, NOT the case, there are few players who I would even dare to compare with Stevie then.

What I was trying to say was at Jonjo's current ability and age and at the rate he's developing (not to mention he's get Stevie showing him the ropes) if 21 year old Shelvey and 21 year old Gerrard were in the same team fighting for the same spot, Jonjo would take his place everytime (this is from somebody who remembers both their first games and what they played like vividly).

I remember Gerrard getting better in certain aspects of his game in stages, Jonjo seems to be getting better each game in all areas of his game (better coaching perhaps I dont know)

true,alshaw,null,null,"In another thread a few months back I wrote this about the comparison that is routinely made between gay so-called rights and racial rights. 

""The argument that gay rights should be regarded as being in the same category as racial or ethnic rights is one that is commonly made.

Against this view, however, the following points should be considered:

a) Homosexuality is undetectable apart from self-identification.

Whereas race can be visually verified (or through family ancestry), there is no external evidence that can confirm or deny a person's claims regarding sexual orientation. Their own self-identification is not subject to external or objective assessment.

Peter Thatchell has recently acknowledged that categories such as gay/bi-sexual are rather fluid and can change during the course of a person's lifetime. Not so with race.

This makes the attribution of rights to gay people legally problematic, if they are granted explicitly on the basis of self-identified sexual orientation.

b) Denying inter-racial couples the right to marry (which is the comparison you cite) is to deny them equal access to an institution that has been legally defined as a heterosexual institution for centuries.

Recognising the rights of an inter-racial couple to marry merely recognises their right to enter the same (heterosexual) union as any other couple.

By contrast, the current attempt to redefine the law is exactly that - a redefinition of the term ""marriage"". The government's consultation is quite explicit about that. At the heart of the debate, therefore, is not the issue of equal access to the same institution, but a legal re-defining of the institution to mean something it has never meant before.

c) Many categories of people are denied the right to marry at present, without such a denial representing a fundamental breach of their human rights.

These categories include children up to the age of 16, individuals who are already married, and close relatives.

Such people are legally discriminated against. That is, a distinction is made in law between them and others. Is such a distinction inherently unjust? Not if it merely defines the category of marriage, saying that it is one thing and not another.

These are some of the reasons that it might not be true to argue that ""gay is not the new black.""

I think it is worth distinguishing between the private and the public sphere of employment. An orthodox Jew would not, presumably, choose a career in a non-Kosher butchers.

It's also worth noting the different strands of religious commitment  - from ultra-conservative to extreme liberal. Those with a faith position tend to choose where to set their boundaries somewhere along the scale if and when they come into conflict with their core values or beliefs.  Pragmatism plays a part.

By the same token, it's worth asking why the irreligious should assume (hypothetically speaking) that their particular freedoms should be upheld in their entirety, when the religious have to make pragmatic and sometimes compromised choices.

We would expect civil servants who object to the idea of same sex marriage to do what they can to try and protect themselves and their jobs from the inevitable fallout that will land on them if this change is brought in. Any other member of society would do so, and no-one would bat an eyelid.

true,CopreaVonDedd,null,null,"I think when Amy and Rory left with the Doctor for their last adventures, they had already lived through that scene. We don't know what year the Doctor picked them up in, and just because they were in 2012 at the beginning of the episode, that doesn't mean that's what year they were from. Think about all the time skips in their last few episodes.

We know they got married in 2010, in the last episode of season 5. At the start of season 6, Amy had a line when she was talking to Canton that it had been a while since she had seen the Doctor, implying it had been at least a few months. And The Impossible Astronaut did take place in 2011.

Then, when the Doctor goes to Amy and Rory's house at the end of The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe, Amy says two years have passed since the last time they saw him. This puts the year at 2013.

Then Pond Life happens over the course of another 5 months, and at the end of Asylum of the Daleks, they go home again. In Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, Amy says that another 10 months had gone by since the last time they saw each other, which bumps us up to 2014. In The Power of Three, it took a full year for the Shakri to execute their plans, which means the year is now 2015.

The ending of PoT suggests that the Ponds traveled with the Doctor from that point until their departure at the end of The Angels Take Manhattan, but I don't believe this is the case. I think they continued travelling with him for a bit, then went home, and continued the pattern of on-again, off-again companions with their last adventure being New York in the 1930's. Here's why.

In The Power of Three, Amy told the Doctor that she had been travelling with him on and off for ten years. Not for the Doctor, and not for the earth, but for Amy and Rory, ten years had passed. Which means, since she started travelling with the Doctor when she was 21, she would now be biologically 31, regardless of the earth year. In The Angels Take Manhattan, she has to be older than 31 because of the age lines under her eyes. I think 31 seems a little young to have noticeable age lines, especially considering what fantastic health Amy is in. Also, she didn't have those lines in The Power of Three, and age lines don't just appear overnight, which means a great deal of time must have passed between those two episodes. I think Amy is probably closer to 40, if not in her 40's already at the time of Angels take Manhattan.

Also, one last point, at the time when Amy told the Doctor that it had been 10 months since she saw him, she also said ""each time you visit, more and more time passes. It's been 10 months this time."" This suggests that there were other adventures that we didn't see with the Doctor and the Ponds, and in between all of those times, there were several months that haven't been accounted for. Which means we don't know for sure what the year is in The Power of Three. My best guess is 2015, but that's only with the information we've been given directly. It could very likely be later than that.

Taking all of this into account, it's completely possible that by the time the Ponds left for their last adventure with the Doctor, they had already lived passed the point when they would have gone to wave at their past selves in The Hungry Earth. That's my theory.

**TL;DR** There are a lot of time skips between the Ponds' adventures with the Doctor, and when you add them all up, it's likely that they were already living in the year 2020 or later at the time of their last adventure.",0,1350075432,null,0,false,0,c6lkyzs,t3_117t20,t1_c6lkyzs,t3_117t20,null,1430132443,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Ha, I don't know if you've seen some of his tackles this season, but he's had his fair share of bad tackles so far. 

Also I think one major thing that seperates Jonjo and Gerrard, is Gerrard's explosiveness. Gerrard always made those surging/cutting runs through the heart of the defense to start the counter attacks and he used his explosiveness/speed to do it, something I don't think Jonjo has or ever will. I honestly think Jonjo is more like a young Lampard, than a young Gerrard(skill wise at least, I agree about the fire part).

I suspect O2 just aren't investing - network keeps collapsing (during the height of iPhone exclusivity there was at least one outage per month), total lack of 3G coverage outside the very inner cities, a shoddy network overall.

You shouldn't *need* to care about customer service if the service as a whole is good enough to begin with - O2 might have to have good customer service given their overall shoddiness.

I'm with EE (T-Mobile) and I have never had to call them for anything more complex than giving them a PAC code and switching off voicemail, both times they handled it fine. They certainly haven't had three or so major nationwide outages within a year, plus a multitude of smaller outages in the past. Personally I'd rather have a reliable network and usable 3G coverage while tolerating slightly worse customer service, which EE provide and O2 do not.

Given that O2 are about to offshore their customer services to South Africa (http://www.cwu.org/news/archive/o2-off-shoring-criticised-by-cwu.html), how long is the allegedly great customer service going to last?

&gt; Also their broadband is fantastic.

Over-rated IMO. Complaints about congestion, no plans for fibre, charge the earth for simple things like IP addresses - they're the trendy ISP for people who think they want better but don't want to pay to be with the real top tier ISPs (Xilo, Andrews and Arnold, Claranet, Bogons, Entanet, Goscomb and others).

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"&gt; a) Homosexuality is undetectable apart from self-identification.

While true, it's irrelevant. Allowing same sex marriages would also allow two straight individuals to marry. Marriage in its current state allows for that fluidity already through divorce.

&gt; This makes the attribution of rights to gay people legally problematic, if they are granted explicitly on the basis of self-identified sexual orientation.

You seem to see it as granting a specific group a right, while I see it as not denying anyone it.

&gt; By contrast, the current attempt to redefine the law is exactly that - a redefinition of the term ""marriage"". The government's consultation is quite explicit about that. At the heart of the debate, therefore, is not the issue of equal access to the same institution, but a legal re-defining of the institution to mean something it has never meant before.

If that's what it takes to not deny a section of humanity a right to that institution...

&gt; c) Many categories of people are denied the right to marry at present, without such a denial representing a fundamental breach of their human rights.

&gt; These categories include children up to the age of 16

Not a denial, a deferral until they reach an age at which they're capable of making such an important decision.

&gt; individuals who are already married

Not a problem in all cultures, and likely to be the next issue with which a Western idea of marriage may need to be redefined.

&gt; and close relatives.

Because it's still a serious taboo in modern society. I doubt it'll be in our lifetime, but one day it may be the case that this gets reconsidered too.

Also, saying ""We mustn't let X do this because we don't allow Y to do it"" is not an argument. The examples you mention have their origins and reasonings that are separate from the issue at hand.

Edit: I'd also like to add, referring back to your earlier arguments, ""conscience"" can be considered just as fluid and undetectable as sexuality. At what point can you clearly differentiate between someone objecting over conscience, and someone objecting because they just want to work fewer hours, for example, or out of pure prejudice?

If you have seen any of the old series Matt is a lot more like the original Doctors and my friend pointed this out to me as why that is: Eccleston's Doctor had just gotten out of creating the Time Lock, releasing The Moment so his Doctor, while still a bit zany, was more serious and to a point angry. Then David came along and he was still serious and angry at times but he was a lot more zany and wacky and funny and more enjoyable to be around it would seem, but he still had that dark side to him from The Time War; David was essentially the buffer between the new ""angry"" Doctor and the old school original Doctors.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"Other people have explained and linked to other things, but I'll have a go at explaining the problem with Greece in simple terms and why it effects us, simply because its the news all the time and is rarely explained properly. Please note this is a heavily simplified version, to write a fully detailed version would require several books, and I'm sure other redditors will fill in any gaps or mistakes.

 Basically all countries borrow money off each other every year. British banks lend money to French banks, Italian banks lend to Greek banks, everyone lends to everyone else. Now these loans have a rate of interest (just like with the loans you can go out and get). Now so long as the country that has borrowed the money is stable and doing well economically, the country which lent them money will charge them a very low rate of interest because it feels confident that the borrowing country's economy is doing well enough for it to pay them back securely. 

Greece essentially throughout the nineties borrowed vast sums of money every year. It was part of the EU, and being part of the EU at that time gave you a reputation as very stable and profitable, so other countries would charge a low rate of interest for them. However, the Greek economy was actually terrible, and it couldn't afford to pay back the loans (with which it had built large amounts of infrastructure and jobs). And when the time came to pay back the debt, it's economy wasn't actually strong enough to pay it back. So the government of Greece borrowed more money to pay back the loans of the money they had already borrowed. This happened again and again, the interest accumulating each year with the government borrowing more and more money to pay back more and more debt. 

This was combined with another problem Greece faces in that there is an informal national sport of not paying tax, or at least not paying very much of it. So essentially the government had a fraction of the money it should have, and even if it had all the money it still wouldn't be enough to pay back the ever increasing debt. You can see where this is going.

Now when it was the early 2000's and everyone's economy was doing fine, no one really cared. Money was flowing, no one wanted to hear words of caution. However, come to 2008 when the economic crash came, every country started getting scared and everyone started demanding money owed to them back - since no one was expecting an economic crash in 2008, very few countries had the money to pay back the loans at that point. 

So now everyone hiked up the rates of interest on the debts because they needed to get as much of their money back as they could before more economies started to crash and they'd lose all their money. Now for some countries like us, the US, Germany etc, this was painful but bearable (still ongoing but we haven't collapsed yet touchwood). But for Greece who already owed a huge amount of money, this was too much. They couldn't pay any of it back. 

Now because so much of their infrastructure, their jobs, their public services, were paid for with this borrowed money, suddenly everything ground to a halt and was cancelled. No more jobs, no more infrastructure. People suddenly realised how screwed Greece was and how it couldn't pay back its debt. This meant there was a huge rush to get all money out of Greece before its economy collapsed and it would be just lost, which meant taking even more money out of the country. 

So basically, no one is investing in Greece which means there are no jobs, there is a huge national debt with no way to pay it back (they owe over $30,000 dollars per citizen, over $300 billion total) and so there is very little future. So understandably, many Greeks are rather unhappy with their government. So when you see people rioting in Athens, that is why.

 This effects us because we lent large portions of money to Greece and if they can't pay it back, we just lose it and have to deal with it, which isn't exactly what we need considering we have our own national debt to repay. Hence why people talk about ""bailouts"" - give them money so they can pay back other countries, sort out their government and start over.

I think he mans up, and visits him one day, months into Brian being without Amy and Rory. He expects to walk in on a broken Brian, and he brings River with him for support. He breaks the news to Brian, that he lost them, that it was all his fault, that he's sorry and that there was nothing he could do. Then he introduces River to him, tells him that it's his granddaughter. 

After they meet, the Doctor suddenly notices two tea cups on the table. This is when Andrew steps forward from the other room. Brian then introduces Andrew to River, ""This is your brother."" he tells her. He then tells them about the letter he received from Rory.

true,WhoMouse,tardis,TARDIS,"Well, since the Doctor, Amy, Rory and River are all ""survivors"" and remember, maybe the Angel does too?  I like to think that it just randomly/habitually sent Rory back, but then 'heard' Amy's plea to be sent back with him and granted it.  Since the Angels created the problem in the first place, maybe they have no problem sending them back there, where the TARDIS travels differently, and the vortex manipulator is different from both.  

I don't know.  All I know is there are going to be holes in just about any of these stories if you pick it apart too far...which I tend to do.  Do the Angels have a hive mind of sorts or are they completely independent (my own opinion is that it's somewhere in-between)?  Since it's purely instinctual (I'm assuming), would they potentially understand/feel/sense time and whatnot better than the Time Lords, since the latter need some school and the schism viewing?  

As far as the Angels in Blink: they wanted the TARDIS, right?  Seeing as how they had the key at one point, then when Sally took it, they stole the TARDIS itself.  I have no idea what they would have done with it (could an Angel survive the energy at the heart?  Or even eat it?  Or would they just create a timey-wimey thing where they sent everyone back to the beginning of the universe and lived on the energy forever?), but they're just trying to send the Doctor, Martha, and that other guy back far enough that they're out of the way.  When it came to the first girl, that Angel was looking for a meal, so sending her back farther gives it more energy, maybe?  

I'm with you on the questions everywhere idea.  But unless we really get to know one on a personal level (which as far as I know would be impossible) I don't know that I want them answered, since any answers would take away the fun mystery.  As long as it can pass my initial suspension of disbelief, I'm *usually* fine with all the questions after.

You'd regret it.

Unless you spend absolutely all your time in high-density urban areas with *guaranteed* signal coverage, chances are you'll find 3 a bit underwhelming. 

It's got to the point where I'm considering keeping an O2 pay as you go SIM on hand for the at least twice-daily occasions where my 3 signal drops through the floor. 

Signal disappearing under bus shelters. Being unable to walk down the street without the stream I'm connected to/download I've got running being dropped. I've even had signal problems in the middle of central London. 

With O2, your phone might be dead two or three days out of the year. With Three, you stand a fair chance of having that distinct pleasure at the most awkward moment imaginable, every single day.

*Speaking purely from personal experience, and the experiences of the people in my life who're also on Three*, it's a godawful thing to chain yourself to for something as essential as a phone connection.

I honestly believe that Blackadder Goes Forth was one of the best bits of British television ever. Forget Fawlty Towers and Red Dwarf, and Spaced, even ignore the carry On movies; the fourth series of Blackadder was possibly the best thing you could ever see on TV.

As the article states, it was a mockery of the war but, yet, it was true to life. Fry was phenomenal as Melchett and McInnery put in a stellar performance as Darling. The 'bahs' and the 'Darling' jokes never got old. Baldrick became a real person that we cared about and Blackadder's quest to survive the war was something I felt we all rooted for.

I feel that one of the most powerful moments in cinematic history is the end of 'Saving Private Ryan' where he stands beside the grave wondering if he fulfilled the wish of 'earn it.' Having lost both Great GrandFathers in WWI and a GrandFather in WW2, it hits home. But, the ending of Blackadder Goes Forth where they pointlessly crest the trench into enemy fire hits home much harder.

As a Brit I have always worn a poppy on Remembrance Day. I have to admit that when I watch the last episode of Blackadder Goes Forth and it fades to a field of poppies that it has me balling like a child. Instant onions. Even though they make a mockery of the war, in that final instance they portray every slain soldier as the hero they were. You relate to every soldier who crested the trenches into a sealed fate. Even in my 40s, it's still probably the most powerful and humbling thing I have ever seen on TV.",0,1350102796,null,0,false,0,c6lqwdd,t3_11dzys,t1_c6lqwdd,t3_11dzys,null,1430135298,7,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,7
