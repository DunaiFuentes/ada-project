I've seen parts of London that only have muslim shops, sell muslim clothes, and apart from a couple of chicken shops only sell hallal food, usually of Bangladeshi origin.  Large parts of east london are like this for example.  It basically means to buy ordinary folks, non muslim women can't go to the market, as they will only sell burqas and niqabs, and other items culturally appropriate to muslims.
This is rather odd to say the least.

I'm not speaking of extremist muslims, I'm talking of moderate muslims.

People that call themselves muslim but don't live a muslim lifestyle I've no issue with. 

However, even most moderate muslims won't drink alcohol or eat pork, for example.  Freemixing (mixed boys and girls together) is frowned upon.  Arranged marriages are reasonably common, but no-one is forced to - morel like your cousin will introduce you to someone.

But - even these 'moderate' aspects are NOT things I won't introduced ANYWHERE in the UK.

Same with the attitude of moderate islam to homosexuality - yes a moderate muslim would be polite, but deep down he 'knows' homosexuality is wrong, a religious crime.

I don't have a problem with this, in fact I think it brings some useful advantages. If the monarchy were to dispose of a popular prime minister there would be an outcry and the movement to disestablish them would become unstoppable. That may not have been the case a couple of generations ago but it is now. 

If things at Westminster ever went ""bad"" with mass protests &amp; strikes the queen could step in and call an election. Used properly this is not a bad thing. I kinda like the idea of a ""political guardian"", someone who has no direct role in daily politics but can call ""shenanigans"" when appropriate.

Yes, you go on thinking it's moral to defer to people posher than you. The monarchy brings in fuck all money as far as tourism goes (more visitors to Legoland Windsor than to Windsor Castle) - moreover the deposed French royal family brings many visitors to Versailles and they're dead for over 200 years.

Let's assume for a moment that the Windsors do work hard, is this an argument for the monarchy? Should we appoint a head of state, MPs or other officials based on who works the most hours in the year?
Nurses, teachers, manual workers, police officers and even City bankers - these are people who work hard. To compare the royals' lifestyle with theirs is absurd. The royals are paid astronomic hourly rates for their ""work"" and yet accept none of the risks of redundancy or formal performance appraisals, and do not have the same chores and responsibilities the rest of us face at home.

The simple truth is that they do very little. Mark Bolland, former press officer for Prince Charles, was quoted in 2005 as saying ""the Windsors are very good at working three days a week, five months of a year and making it look as though they work hard"".

What happened at Inter was very much the exception not the rule - although granted, it was quite some fuck-up.

In short: the problem is his unpopularity because of what he said towards chelsea, but all managers, ESPECIALLY Rafa say things to get a rise. The problem is NOT his talent.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I believe we live in a country where, for the most part, common-sense, and common decency towards other people, prevails.

Point in case? Look at the kerfuffle that's been kicked up over the CoEs decision yesterday on the issue of Women Bishops.

&gt;I've seen parts of London that only have muslim shops, sell muslim clothes, and apart from a couple of chicken shops only sell hallal food, usually of Bangladeshi origin. Large parts of east london are like this for example. It basically means to buy ordinary folks, non muslim women can't go to the market, as they will only sell burqas and niqabs, and other items culturally appropriate to muslims. This is rather odd to say the least.

I'd imagine the area you're talking about has a large immigrant population. It's not uncommon, therefore, for businesses to start up that are geared to that population. I live in the West Midlands - over the last I'd say five years there have been an increase in shops that cater to newer immigrant workers, such as the Poles.

I don't personally see that as threatening. I see it as a chance to experience new culture, and broaden my horizons.

Why not go in those shops? On the route I take to / from work, a Muslim owned supermarket opened a few months ago. I'm now a regular, and have never once felt intimidated. Last time I went in I was wearing a coat no straight man would be seen dead in, with a Poppy attached to it. No one batted an eyelid. If I can't find something - or I don't know what something is? I ask.

The Tesco near where I work, for example, is geared up to serve a multi-cultural workforce, with a large Hallal meat counter. It's not my cup of tea, but to each his / her own.

&gt;However, even most moderate muslims won't drink alcohol or eat pork, for example. Freemixing (mixed boys and girls together) is frowned upon. Arranged marriages are reasonably common, but no-one is forced to - morel like your cousin will introduce you to someone.

I don't drink alcohol, or eat pork. I don't do that for any religious reasons, just because it's not my thing. People are free to chose what they wish to incorporate into their diet - I live on a self-imposed food budget of £40 per month, yet I wouldn't dream of enforcing that on other people.

As for arranged marriages -how do you know it's not a ""Modern"" arranged marriage, like the one my Hindu friend did for his daugher? She met her future husband, they dated for a few years, then he asked for permission to get married, and the father arranged it. It wasn't two people who'd never met being married off, it was two people who fell in love with each other, over a few years, and then the father arranged the ceremony [which was fascinating to be a part of.]

&gt;Same with the attitude of moderate islam to homosexuality - yes a moderate muslim would be polite, but deep down he 'knows' homosexuality is wrong, a religious crime. Do we want this religious idea to spread? Do we want integration to take some of these elements and form part of the broader UK culture.

Do you have the /usr/bin/get-iplayer-web-pvr file ?

If not perhaps the version in 12.04 doesn;t have it - also did you use a PPA or just normal repo?

On the Linux reddit someone also suggested it wasn't there and said use

Full disclosure: I'm an American from a US city with a fairly large Muslim population; two of my best friends were Egyptians when I was a child.

Bread and circuses. Keep doing what they tell you, pleb.

&gt; Don't want to elect the ceremonial head of state
So you're happy to passively accept one of our most prominent national symbols being a farce of inequality. Of course you are! Bread and circuses!

&gt;Proof please.
Of the top 20 tourist attractions in the UK only one royal residence makes it: Windsor Castle at number 17 (beaten comfortably by Windsor Legoland, in at number 7). Royal residences account for less than 1% of total tourist revenue. Indeed, the success of the Tower of London (number 6 in the list) suggests that tourism would benefit if Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle were vacated by the Windsor family.

The British tourist industry is successful and robust - castles and palaces would remain a part of our heritage regardless of whether or not we have a monarchy (look at Versailles in France). Other attractions, such as the London Eye, Trafalgar Square, the west end, Bath, Stonehenge, Britain's beautiful countryside and so on, will continue to attract tourists in the same numbers as they do today. The government body responsible for tourism, Visit Britain, hasn't even collated statistics on the monarchy as an attraction, which shows it is not a key factor in the promotion of the UK as a tourist destination.

The tourism argument has been dreamt up to distract people from the real issues. There is no evidence that the monarchy is good for tourism, in fact, there are good reasons why the opposite might be true. Imagine the potential for Buckingham Palace if it was fully opened up to tourists all year round, where visitors can explore every room and courtyard and see the grounds and the magnificent art collection. And of course popular ceremonies such as the changing of the guard can continue.

&gt;Proof? Where did you get this idea from, other than they have high standards demanded by the poshness of the job. And don't make this a circle, they dress up because they have money because they dress up is useless

Perhaps the problem is one of education.

The UK has a policy of allowing state-funded religious schools.  A group of muslims can setup an Islamic school to 'cater' to the local population.  It's unlikely non muslims are going to send their kids there as they want them to get a more regular education.   This only breeds segregation.

There are things we can look at to see that this is true like ""males MPs outnumber female MPs"". Now, the affirmative action route is to bias in favor of woman so that female MPs are roughly equal in number to male MPs. However having unequal number of MPs was not the problem, it was only evidence that a problem existed. What we wanted to fix was female representation in politics. The question of whether adjusting the ratio of MPs has been beneficial to woman's representation remains, or if we have merely skewed the measure of inequality. To answer this we need to look at some other, independent, way of measuring female representation, such as party membership or local involvement within a party.

If you want to convince people of something, don't tell them why you're right and they're wrong - tell them why they already agree with you. 

Your post is inherently confrontational. It's predicated on the assumption that a group of people who should be a potential pool of converts (CoE disestablishers who like the monarchy) are hypocrites. Even if that isn't your intention it is how it is being received. 

The post should be along the lines of 'Isn't the Church of England a great example of how unreformed, outdated and embarassing our constitution is?'

Once that premise is established show people how the same is true of other parts of the constitution - Lords, Monarchy (unitary government, majoritarian elections, asymmetric devolution, being uncodified, having so set procedure for appointing the prime minister or cabinate, etc etc etc).

Torres to start a few games one because he's a know variable to Benitez and Sturridge injury 

I expect only 2 of the 3 Hazard, Mata, Oscar to be playing in a game, Mata first choice then probably Hazard then Oscar. This will be done to sort out the defense 

I expect 3 midfielders Ramires, Mikel and this is the tough one, Lampard is injured, Romeu is still unconvincing maybe Oscar might play on instructions in a deeper role which I think might be his best position anyway he has a fantastic long shot and range of passing 

The defense should pick itself be interesting the RB selection Azpi or Iva and also be interesting if Luiz will be a first choice CB 

You can probably expect chelsea to play on the counter attack through ramires hazard mata torres

I doubt we will change to zonal marking the problem with defending corners in general is work ethic. If a player wants to get his head on the ball and is more hungry than the opposition he will do so. Look at Drogba the opposition knows its going to go to him probably but he works hard and is hungry for it and is helped by his physical attributes.

true,YeahBruvInit,uk,United Kingdom,"Thanks.  The sad thing is I hear from some moderate muslims that they are 'forced' into ghettos.

When on the internet I see muslims using student forums to find out 'where other muslims go to university' to ensure they are going somewhere with other muslims.  As if living alongside the average non-muslim would be impossible.

When I see areas of large muslim population there is inevitably a 'community centre'.   Look at the planning applications for these - there's a couple near to me.  Go inside one.  I did once, in a part of east london.  All muslim, 100%, getting stared at by everyone.  Now, this was not my local area, but I could see from just people walking about that it wasn't a 100% muslim area.  Why call something a 'community centre' if it's not intended for all the community?

When the bigger mosques are built, you will always see 'it will include a community centre - open for all the community'.  How often do you see folk using the facilities there.  Obviously you will hear 'well we can't force people', but, come on.  If you want to play some tennis, pool, or find a spare room to hold a meeting for a book-reading club, are you going to try the mosque first?

These organisations never actively PROMOTE their use as community centres outside their community.  And they should, but they choose not to.

Can a gay-rights group hold a meeting in a community centre like this I wonder?  Probably they'd choose not to, but again - if the possible use is not being promoted, if muslim groups don't reach out, then it's no wonder they just get demonised.

There's a similar directory that exists for Indian businesses, and for Jewish ones. I've also been to clubs that will promote gay friendly businesses. And organise boycotts of less friendly ones.

I actually agree with your point about community centres attached to Mosques. The local Muslim association just up the road from where I live have been trying for years to build a new Mosque, as the existing one is no longer fit for purpose.

Now personally I couldn't give a fuck what gets built. It's a dead town, used by thugs like the EDL for marches and little protests, and quite frankly the current land is a horrible eyesore. Build a sodding two mile high Mosque for all I care.

*With two caveats.*  No tax payers money should go towards it, and the Community centre attached to it - if it truly *is* a community centre, should be open to the entire local community, with no usage restrictions placed on it.

As someone who's followed Rafa at Valencia and Liverpool (probably saw 30% of his matches with the former and 90%+ with the latter) I thought I'd share a few things about him.  

~ As a reference-point, rather than Liverpool, [I think Valencia is the team you should look at](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/29/teams-of-the-decade-11-valencia-2001-04/). He implemented a somewhat-similar style at both clubs but I think the personnel he has at Chelsea more closely resemble what he had there - Liverpool involved a lot more specialisation in the roles of Masch and Xabi, and much more freedom for the Gerrard. Valencia, meanwhile, featured a bit more flair from the wide players behind the striker, a more dedicated creator in Aimar (with less tackling and tracking-back) and 2 all-rounder midfielders in Baraja and Albelda who were pretty comfortable winning the ball and carrying it forward, as well as passing. 

~ Torres: While the formations are ostensibly the same, the shape of Chelsea's 4-2-3-1 and Liverpool's is pretty different. What got the best out of Torres at 'Pool was the amount of space created for him to exploit - for all his strengths in terms of speed, power and finishing, what really made him world-class at Liverpool was the way he could always find that space and make good use of it. In matches where he was more static, he'd miss sitters if he was standing still; meanwhile, he was incredible when he was moving *to* an active ball. Chelsea's current formation has 3 (arguably 4, with Ramires or Lampard attacking the box) midfielders who are at their best probably just outside their opponents' box, which does mean that a lot of their best play involves inadvertently crowding Torres out of space - he doesn't dominate a box the way Drogba did or Falcao does. I know a lot of this probably isn't news to most of you, but I'm riffing a bit.

~ Working with those two points in mind, it's a little hard to predict what changes he'll make to the starting line-up. I'd expect to see Oscar move to the midfield 2, probably with Ramires, and Hazard to play slightly wider left, with Mata playing in (my favorite role for him) the 2nd-striker role behind Torres and Moses on the right (I have to confess, I don't know much about Marin or Piazon, or Lampard's fitness situation, this is just speculation).

~ Defensively, he'll either make a world-beater out of Luiz or make him cry and play him at reserve-LB, it's a bit of a toss-up. But I've heard a lot of talk (and observed it, to some extent) that Luiz could be a fantastic defender if he improved his concentration and positioning a bit, and if that's true, I think Benitez is capable of making that happen.

~ His choice of staff will be interesting. He's always been good at surrounding himself with good coaches and assistants, but not always the best at keeping them. After a couple seasons out of the game, I'm interested in seeing who he brings in, especially if it's officially an interim job. Wouldn't be surprised to see some of his ex-players brought along (although I really don't want to see Big Sami in your dugout).

No, I'm saying we shouldn't legislate in favour of religious doctrine. Big difference.

&gt; You think you can tell a church what their their beliefs should be?

The Church should be able to believe whatever they want. But they shouldn't be afforded special protection when, in practising their beliefs, they would otherwise violate employment law.

&gt; When women enter that church they need to realise that their religion says they can't be bishops. If they don't like it then they should find another church, preferably none at all.

I don't even know how these guides deal with equality legislation.

Same goes for Jewish business directories - in this case, unless it was actually for those business providing jewish religious services, perhaps marriage counselling, something where you need to understand Jewish faith... maybe Kosher food companies and so on.  But the truth is you will see the same as the Asian or Muslim business directory.  Just another way of discriminating against outsiders and not integrating, by their own choosing.

A lot of religions aren't gay-friendly correct.  Most have mainstream branches that tolerate it.  I've yet to see a mainstream branch of islam or even a single mosque (not even one), where homosexuality is tolerated.

Is there a single mosque on Earth where homosexuality is tolerated?  There is toleration of this and much more in every other major faith.  I've seen thousands of gay buddhists, even gay monks in Thailand.
I've seen whole congregations of Christians where homosexuality is more than tolerated, it's accepted.  The Anglican Church in the US has gay bishops and so on.  Hinduism doesn't have much to say about gays at all.

Looks like there's one mosque for gay folk, and it's opening today in Paris, France:

4. Loads. Join the Athletics Union (the sports club) and you'll have loads of chances to play football.

Do you complain that a ladies underwear shop doesn't sell male stuff like you're complaining there are Islamic markets?

I can see here that the thing that you are fearing isn't Islam but change.

Britain has been changing for hundreds of years and it will continue to change. I don't see many people complaining about the Anglo Saxons any more and that had a much bigger effect of British culture than I see Islam having in the long run.

As an Atheist I can tell you there are a lot of disagreeable things about all religions including Christianity and a lot of crappy beliefs being held by them but things that on the whole people don't agree with won't have a lasting effect on the culture.

There are a lot of great things from Asian communities being brought into British culture like the food an looking after your family and giving to charity ect.

true,sipos0,uk,London,"Yeah, I certainly don't think vigilante attacks on people thought to be paedophiles are a good thing. 

I guess I've always thought he seemed a bit off and irrational feelings about how he acts have always made me think at the back of my mind that he seems like he might be a paedophile. I know this is no reason to investigate someone and that such prejudices are unhelpful but, I am nevertheless surprised that it is only coming out now. If I was working with him, I think I would have (irrationally) been on the alert already for anything like that so, I guess I'm just surprised that nobody saw anything, reported it and a proper investigation wasn't started sooner. 

I'm not saying that it should have come out earlier because it was 'obvious' he was a paedophile or anything - accusing someone because you feel like there is something a bit off about them is no way to behave (though, it obviously should have come out earlier because of things like the bit in this autobiography that you mentioned). 

Irrational feelings are just that though so, perhaps it's just coincidence that I find him particularly creepy and, perhaps there is nothing to it and there is someone who feels like that about everyone. 

Edit: I agree about the importance of investigating it properly and finding out why it was allowed to happen instead of dismissing it now he's gone but, I do think that at this point, it looks unlikely that he is innocent (though that's no reason not to check properly).

The two aren't mutually exclusive. We can keep our values and freedoms, whilst in terms of religion, we could mutate into some kind of shonky post-pre-internet collage of superstitions.

Some bits of islam are archaic, as are some aspects of christianity and some aspects of buddhism, odinism, and pick-your-nose-and-eat-it-ism.

I'm more bothered by the complete lack of a *reason* why two different things happened at the same time in order to blow up time.

If you follow each character's personal point of view, they each arrive at that lake once, and only once. There's no second time for anyone where they can do things differently - just different camera angles.

It was ""blowing up time sounds cool, let's just say it happened"" without any logic. At least the previous times that the universe was blown up, there was the old-fashioned ""paradoxes are bad, mmmkay?"" explanation.

&gt;  but how could the robot 'regenerate'? Is it just a feature of the robot, did I miss something, or is it a plothole?

My theory is that Moffat was going with the ""flesh doctor doppleganger"" theory til it was too obvious, then threw in a different way to fake the Doctor's death when it proved to be too fucking obvious. Of course, we all knew it was being faked, anyway.

Sure, you can go for ""the robot also produced a light show"" theory. I used to think I was easily impressed, then I met Doctor Who fans.

I did like the preview for the Christmas special though:

Matt: Will the doctor be persuaded to save the day?  
Whats-her-face: Yes  
Matt: Way to ruin dramatic tension.

- Rafa signs an 18 month contract, with an opt out on both sides at the end of the season.

RTD: introduce psychic satellites and paradox machine at the start of the first episode, actually use them in the end of the second part.

The whole ""floaty"" thing? Why is ""psychically controlling seven billion people"" so much more realistic than ""small-scale telekinesis, powered by that psychic energy""? Really, would the episode have been *that* much better if they had filmed him standing up and walking down some steps? Overly dramatic, maybe. But hardly a bigger problem than ""psychic powers"".

Moffat: just have some paradoxes that mean nothing, end the two-parter by having a girl remember the universe back into existence.

While I'll agree that the special effects aren't *always* up to the standard I would expect from a multi-million dollar movie, the fact that it's a TV show episode on a BBC budget means I'll forgive the special effects if the story is acceptable.

On that standard, RTD is still better than Moffat.

Which is odd, because Moffat has proven many times that if you let him write a stand-alone episode, he can be one of the best writers the show has ever seen. I think he's got caught up in trying to out-do RTD with blowing-up-the-universe stories, and can't drop it yet - despite the whole ""the Doctor is going off the radar"" thing because he's set up this big battle that people will expect to see, now.

I know you guys (mostly) hate Rafa due to love lost back in the day, but I don't think you guys need to worry about him sticking around.

Rafa, like Hiddink, is extremely capable tactically (unlike RDM - sorry if you take offense to this but he hasn't been very pragmatic tactically and most teams look like the have Chelsea 'figured out' regardless of the unbelievable talent you guys have).  He will bring order and get the best out of Torres (*if* Torres is there come January).  He'll also pull things together defensively.  Look at the team we managed to win the CL with - let's face it - they weren't *that* great of a team.  We had some good players (Alonso, Gerrard in his prime, the Sami Hyypia-Carragher defensive partnership), but we also had some pretty average players (Harry Kewell, Djimi Traore, etc).  

I doubt any have read his book, or even Carragher's autobiography, but if you get a chance to flick through either you can really see he has an incredibly tactical mind.  He has some pretty good articles on his [blog](http://www.rafabenitez.com/web/index.php?act=mostrarBlog&amp;idioma=in&amp;ca=4) that give some insight into his managerial style.

Swansea beat Arsenal and Liverpool.  West Brom sits at fourth place this season.

It's not La Liga, where it's automatic for Real and Barca to win everytime, unless they play each other.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Solid analysis. As John touched on earlier, it's so predictable what Chelsea are going to do due to the chronic lack of width. Moses and Marin were signed but have yet to make any meaningful run of appearances while all three of Mata, Hazard and Oscar want to play a tight passing game in and around the 18 yard line with Torres looking disinterested as he lacks the kind of close control to make anything of a ball received in such a congested area. What RDM failed to do was implement a wide player in to the front 4, every team knew who they were going to face since our lineup became so predictable

I'll be looking to Rafa to change things up a bit. While Mikel offers defensive stability and Ramires is seemingly nuclear-powered, there is no creativity between them and neither can pick a pass. While we can't address the lack of midfield power right now, the creativity issue can be partially tackled. I wouldn't mind seeing a 4-3-3 implemented sometimes either, allowing Lampard a bit more time on the ball to pick a pass while our forward line would have more space to operate in. It would also allow Mikel to stay further back and help out defence instead of being caught too far upfield

David Luiz is a frustrating player to watch. Alongside JT he's better, it's almost as if he needs that guiding voice in his ear to keep him focused on his task. Alongside Cahill he looks lost and goes wandering. Maybe he'll mature, he's still young but it's a big 'if'

As for Torres, I don't think he's scored what you described as a 'static goal' for Chelsea. Most of what I recall was scored via pace or movement. Didier had the prowess to trap the ball, turn and still get a powerful shot off. Come to think of it, the goal against Arsenal was due to his technique and he didn't have to move all that much for it

As for Benitez's time away from the job, he's been keeping busy exploring cutting-edge techniques with regards to coaching/management. I believe there are some lectures he wrote on his personal website. Anyway, I too have rambled. I assume you know nothing of my opinions as to the squad but I've maintained for some time that we are lacking in two key areas; striker (clearly) and a midfield brutus. In an ideal world Roman will whip out the chequebook and sign up Fellaini and Falcao

Also, I don't like Rafa as a person. Here's one of his choice quotes which is apparently framed at Mellwood...

Torres needs to make runs into space that is what strikers are supposed to do, the reason other players are ""crowding his space"" as you call it is because he makes absolutely no runs for them to pass the ball behind defences to him.

I've lived for years now in a part of the world that has a huge Muslim population. Easily a quarter of my colleagues are Muslim. The representation of women to men in the workforce here that are Muslim, is roughly 50-50. Sure, some of the women wear headscarves to work - but I've no issue with it. Many Muslim women that I know do not veil, and some of them are even more daring in their style of dress than I.

Around where I live, it's not uncommon to find Muslim men sitting around with cans of beer in the evenings. While I suspect that these persons may be in the minority of very secular Muslims, the fact remains that they do exist. 

Not once have I been criticised for my beliefs or practices by any of my Muslim friends or colleagues. I should add that in my current office, there is at least one Muslim man who is a flaming *queen* (he has actually turned up to work dressed in female clothing before). None of the other Muslims in the office have batted an eyelid at him: in fact, he appears to be rather popular amongst them.

My point is simply this: there is as wide a spread of opinions and standards amongst Muslims as there is in any religion in the world. If the Dalai Lama can find it in himself to [justify his use of meat](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/dalailama/article/876530--the-dalai-lama-is-a-meat-eater) as a food article, why should one expect that Islam should not contain a plethora of views, within itself?

Do also remember that in places like Somalia, the Arab states and some of the more 'backward' areas of the world, the brand of Islam that is practised is *not* at all representative of that which more 'modern' Muslims adhere to.

Catholic schools exist. Children learn 'R.E.' (basically Jesus shoved down their throats) and I don't see 'Islamic Studies' being any different. Just two different turds from the same arsehole.

&gt;Would you be happy with your children attending a free islamic school (assuming it had a good academic rating). In West london they would be taking GCSE Urdu and Arabic

What a fucking bullshit strawman.

Also GCSE's in those language would be great, better than the boring options of French and German imo. 

But it doesn't matter, because that's never going to happen. You're lamenting the possible rise of Islamic schools and instead favouring catholic ones. I don't want my child attending either, I'd rather they learn about other cultures and faiths by being in the same class as people of other cultures and faiths.

&gt;They would be surrounded by muslims; and the culture would rub off on them. You'd be happy with this?

I don't really see anything wrong with moderate islam. I mean, look at moderate Christianity. Sexism is inherent in the beliefs and the system of religion, peadophilia runs rampant throughout the organized church, terrorist attacks have been committed in the name of christianity/catholicism.

true,aldhelm,null,null,"First of all let me point by saying I'm a Muslim and a Somali at that too. I thought most of the stuff you said was pretty reasonable and it avoided the Daily Mail type of outrage. However You are definently wrong in this post.

&gt;Most young muslims I've met deal with their faith by saying that non-muslim girls are for f***ing but when you get married you want a good muslim girl that would be faithful. 

Thats not the talk of a young muslim. That is the talk of a horny young man who wants to excuse his behaviour. Muslims **are not** allowed to have sex before marriage whether male or female. It doesn't even matter if the person they are having sex with is muslim or not. Sex before marriage is banned full stop. I know guys like these. They want to shag somebody but they don't want to feel like they are breaking the rules of the faith they have grown up. Thats why they come up with excuses to make it easier to deal with the fact that they know they are breaking their own belief system.

&gt; The basic idea is you can drink, play the field (but not with muslim girls),until you get married (so long as you don't embarrass your family), then once married you live a muslim life and have kids.

That is also wrong. Alcohol is always forbidden no excuses is allowed and the way your family feel about your action is not an indicator of anything. One of the things Muslims kids get drilled about when we're young is that pretending to be a good muslim or acting like a good muslim for appearances is a terrible sin. Religion isn't about pleasing,showing off or having pride. It's strictly about worshipping God and only Gods opinion matter. Also if someone drank and played the field and then settled down to a nice muslim lifestyle. It wouldn't abrogate their previous behaviour.



P.s. I would like to point out that the lady you talked to was highly likely to not be a third generation Somali. By thid generation I would assume that their grandparents came to the UK and  their parents were born and bred British Somali. The vast majority of Somalis like me came in to the UK in the last 24 years. So far the majority of Somalis are 1st generation immigrants, 1.5 generation like me who came to the UK as children and the 2nd generation are being born now.

There are Somalis who have lived in the UK before the 80s. However they have basically disappeared. They used to live in East London,Newport,Cardiff,Liverpool and other port areas. They intergrated and married White British and have basically melded into society. A great example would be the [punk rock singer Poly Styrene who was born in the 50s.](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;cp=7&amp;gs_id=43&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=poly+styrene&amp;safe=off&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=38897761&amp;biw=1025&amp;bih=415&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=9YmtUIiiGMfY0QWLrIHQAg)


Now for the current state of the Somalis who came recently. There is a massive difference emerging between people like my parents who came to the UK as adults and people like me who came as kids and grew up in the UK. I hear complaints of how we have become to British and that we are losing our language. Which is very true since most of us can barely speak our mother tongue and prefer to use English despite living in a 100% Somali Households. I can't even read or write Somali.

I'm on a mixed fence on this. On one hand you can't live in an another country without absorbing influences and eventually ending up like your neighbours. That isn't bad. The only time I have a problem is when Somalis end up living in bad neighbourhoods and the kids pick up the local ""gangsta"" culture. To many Somalis live in areas like these and they see the only solution to save their kids from bad influences is by stressing the life of a strict muslim. After all if you spend your time avoiding London gangs and in the Mosque. You won't end up in prison for drug charges.

From what I understand - speaking as someone with only a GCSE RS understanding of Islam and what I've learned from years of non-fic articles online - Islam is a many-faceted religion in much the same way as Christianity, with many conflicting interpretations of the texts upon which it's based. For this reason I'm not sure it's necessarily fair to say that ""Islam"" is in conflict with these principles in much the same way as it's not fair to lump all Christian denominations into the same group.

3. I know a few people who went there. In the end, it's what you are like personally - there's a great sense of family here, and everyone gets on and knows so many people due to how small the town is, whereas Durham is a bit bigger and might not be the same.

4. I play in a Sunday league, it's extremely laid back (I play with others from my hall, but anyone can play/ make a team) and I've got to know all of these people really well. There's also a six-a-side league on Thursdays, but I haven't tried it yet...

If you were rejecting any influence, you might as well say so long Socrates, piss off, Plato, and you're a total arse, Aristotle.

The numbers suggest there are roughly the same percentage of vegetarians in the UK as there are Muslims, yet loads of shops still sell meat. Being part of British culture is not a zero sum game, whatever rules a section of our society choose to follow does not necessitate *everyone* following those rules.

As for your last point, I'd be quite happy with that - the point a lot of people on this thread are making is that lots of different cultures have been integrated into this country over the last several thousand years, and you seem to be okay with the way that has turned out? That won't happen unless 'culture rubs off', which is a two way street. Taking GCSE Arabic or Farsi etc would be brilliant for British kids, learning another language is valuable and in an increasingly global community having those skills will be in great demand in the workplace.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Perhaps dreadful was too strong of language. I do not think the 10-11 Inter side was a strong squad by any means, though.

My point is that Mourinho worked wonders with that team, and while they had players who performed magnificently in the system Mourinho laid out, they have since shown that they are not the side they were cracked up to be. I don't think it is a coincidence that since Mou left, they have done next to nothing in any competition.

That is something I don't think can be pinned on Rafa-- he was coming into a side that was euphoric about winning it all, then distraught at losing Mourinho, and that proceeded to play with a lethargy and disinterest under Rafa and successors that (I think) should be chalked up more to losing an emotional leader than to anything Rafa did or didn't do. He was never going to perform under those circumstances because Mou's treble was an impossible act to follow. The team was built perfectly to play in the way Mourinho wanted them to play, and both tactically and emotionally, Rafa is simply not Mourinho.

So my main point is that I believe Rafa should be judged more in terms of his results with Liverpool and Valencia than his stint with Inter. He is a good manager, and he has had time off in which he has been studying the game. This is not the first time we have been linked with him, so I would assume he comes into the side with some strategies that he thinks will get the most out of our players.

Seriously though, he was Liverpool manager during the Mourinho years
and built up quite a rivalry between the two of them, which lead to him saying some rather disparaging things about the club, the players, and the fans which lots of people still remember. 

Plus during the Rafa years we just seemed to get Liverpool in every single knockout stage of every cup competition going (including 3 CL semi finals, 1 CL quarter final, an FA cup semi final, and a League Cup final) which again lead to even more animosity between us. 

It's going to be bizarre seeing him in our dugout, to say the very least. ",0,1353556123,null,0,false,0,c751o7z,t3_13lmon,t1_c751o7z,t3_13lmon,null,1430470040,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

You sort of introduced your overall theme by somewhat citing Howard's view of Australia and ~~their~~ his opinion on how people immigrating to Australia should accordingly act. I really haven't made the connection between that and the UK, but I'm assuming you're interested in the UK providing similarly profound statements. 

That said, you like the principle of equality; so you enjoy a system of belief or behaviour based on the foundational principle of equality. Equality being: having equality in status, freedoms, and opportunities. So you want, and believe in equality, but you think the UK shouldn't pick up cultural elements from Islam? 

Two questions then:

1. Why do you think that you should get to decide what the UK adopts into cultural norms? Isn't that the *very thing* you're attempting to block Islam from contributing towards? Simply, you like that the UK has the decency to give you the power to act how you want (to obvious extents) from the time you wake up to the time you fall asleep, but you want  the UK to be restricted in doing that very thing as well? Because Islam doesn't exactly align with the cultural norms that you, yourself have drawn out on your handkerchief? You're scared that Muslims are going to destroy Western life? **what?** I have a very small amount of friends who are Muslim, three I believe. My life is 927359874597234% better because of them. I have no proof that this stat makes sense, but it is how I feel.


2. Where are you basing your opinion that Muslim culture/ideals/opinions/attitudes is going to destroy, and not you know, say, improve the UK's culture? You've taken a look at one website (which I'm not even going to investigate) and dismissed a whole system of belief because a very small percentage (I'm assuming) are in the UK and don't want to assimilate with the UK's culture. What if you took this kind of thinking every time you watched a new cartoon, ate a new cereal, met a new kid on the playground, played **only** one game. Hint: Your life would suck, and it would suck super hard. 

I guess, you're not wrong. But you sure as fuck are not right. So really, I can empathize with your line of thinking, because as a Brit who lives in Toronto, Canada, I can walk for an hour and go through a dozen ""x-towns"". China Town, Little Italy, Greek Town. Would I prefer it if I could have a safe little bubble when the rain comes down hard? Somedays, admittedly yes. But shit, I see so many awesome things come from all different walks of life everyday that I can't help but think if I and everyone else thought this way, I wouldn't be able to walk ten minutes down the street and have the most bang-up curry from some of the most friendliest people. We'd miss out on a ton of other amazingly amazing things too, but I love curry, so I'm going with that. 

If you are concerned with Islam taking over your corner-pub or convenience store, you more than have the power as a citizen of the UK to move as far away as possible as you like. That's your goddamn right. 

Stop blaming discomfort. Please.

I'd be very surprised if Jose stays with Madrid past this season. Add to that the fact that he has always been very open about his desire to return to England, and his love for the club &amp; London. 

Then consider the positive reaction the club would get from the fans for bringing him back (especially needed after this Benitez debacle).

He's already been spotted house hunting in West London this year, plus I'm pretty sure I saw somewhere in the Spanish press that his daughter is starting college in London next year too.

Could be the perfect storm that carries the Special One home...

true,Adys,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"I've lived in France most of my life. Its situation is very different for a few reasons:

 - France is laic and tries to be at every possible level. From that angle, islam is left with a lot more freedom than it would be in the UK. So at a political level, they do not encounter as much resistance should they bring changes to *lifestyle* with them.
 - However, *political* changes cause a much stronger backlash than in the UK for that same reason. Back when I lived there, there was the whole drama about veils in school, which ended up being banned.
 - French people tend to be quite xenophobic (a lot more than brits anyway). This might give you an illusion that there is stronger tension than there really is.
 - Southern France has direct contact with Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Cities there end up with a lot of arabs; as with all immigration, a lot of those people end up with monetary issues. Failed integration results in crime, which means a lot of the crime there ends up being committed by arabs. This gives the usual illusion that ""most arabs are criminals"".

The UK is a popular destination for poorer countries due to its lifestyle and living costs. Yes, we are going to get our fair share of muslim immigrants, but compared to France it's next to nothing.

Every immigrant brings with them a bit of their lifestyle. As /u/safaridiscoclub mentioned, that part is evolution. It's slow, steady, and a good sign for a country. Countries that have stale communities become stuck in time and that eventually has repercussions on an economical level.

Now to answer your question:

 * ""is it wrong to fear the rise of islam"". By itself, no, it's not wrong. Several muslim countries are failed countries on some levels, so it's not wrong to be afraid of a *governing* islam.
 * ""... in the UK"". It's silly, not wrong, because it won't happen. If after my post you're still afraid of that, feel free to ask more detailed questions and I shall answer. 
 * ""is it wrong to fear ... islam"". Bit of a bonus question, because I think you're kind of asking that too. It's as wrong to fear islam as it is to fear christianity: it's in the eye of the beholder. As a religion, they both have pasts filled with good and bad elements. Islam gained quite a bad reputation lately but as a religion, it forbids most of the crap extremists pull in the first place. Just because someone does something ""in the name of &lt;insert word here&gt;"" does not mean said element condones it. After 9/11, islam has become an easy to blame target both for politicians and laymen. It's a religion, it's different, it's a minority and it has horrible people associated with it. Take what you will from that pot, I'm atheist and don't really care either way.

As for your tldr: I answered it above, the UK picking up elements from elsewhere is evolution and it's a good thing. There's some great stuff to acquire from those communities — food, religious diversity, self control are three elements that come to mind right away. Let's keep in mind that fear tends to exaggerate reality and bend the truth for you, something papers such as the Daily Mail prey on.

----

When it comes to the EU, people seem to think that it is an in/out institution, that the relationships within a Super-National Organisation which has power over 500 million people cannot be complex. This is obviously far from the truth.

Britain could repatriate powers, it could avoid levels of integration. I really do not see why this couldn't be the case! The problem is that EU currently doesn't have much of a mechanism for uneven participation, which often makes out relationship strained with it. This will can be rectified and probably will be: considering that Eurozone is already doing things unevenly with the rest of EU, it is not a big step for this to become apart of the very fabric of the European Union. An uneven relationship between a very divided continent.

I am optimistic about the UK's relationship with the EU. The mindless populism that *could* make us leave such a valuable institution is unlikely to get much ground: the PM is being pretty stern on not having an in/out referendum thank god. The UK is as valuable to the EU, as it is the other-way round (maybe even more so).

Southmead is to be avoided but Henbury has got really nice, cheap houses and flats and it's a good area although it's further away. Ditto Coombe Dingle.

Horfield might be good for you. It's cheaper and is next to Gloucester Road which is famous for having the most number of indie shops on one street in Britain.

Filton is close again but watch your choice of road because there's OK-Filton and then there's really-bad-Filton. There are loads of newly built houses around the top top of the hill on Filton Avenue that might do.

Frenchay and Stapleton are quite close to Filton and are nice communities especially the former. Frenchay is a village with a major hospital so there are lots of docs and nurses living there. Downend is nice and green as well if a little further away.

The two most obvious suggests for your price and location are Stoke Gifford and Bradley Stoke. Both are fairly anonymous sprawling estates, so far away from anything other than the M4 and M5 that they're much cheaper.

North of the M4 you've got the villages around Frampton Cotterell in South Gloucestershire. On the whole, they don't look like much but are cheaper. Thornbury is the biggest town there and is also worth a look.

And finally, you could rely on the ring road, which might be the end of you thanks to the congestion, and live in the east of the city in an area like Oldland Common and Emersons Green which are nice and cheaper than the West of the City.

It ""creates jobs"" (hate that phrase), and leads to the development of thousands of new technologies (you can't solve a hard problem without solving lots and lots of small problems) many of which will have applications outside of the core industry that developed them (warfare has given us some amazing peacetime medical advancements, NASA gave us velcro). Hopefully it's obvious that creating new, better solutions to problems is a good thing for the economy (and people in general, too!)

As I said this applies to any hard problem, and I would love to see us tackling more. Energy and transportation are two obvious ones. Space does have an extra advantage - it allows us to discover and understand more about the universe. In turn, gaining greater understanding of the building blocks of our universe allows us to create increasingly amazing technology closer to home (imagine you spent your whole life building things out of Duplo, and one day someone gave you Lego - suddenly you'd have way more options!)

Secondly, and this is the argument you're more likely to see from geeks online than from the man in the pub, there's a serious long-term component to this. Right now, close to 100% of humanity is on one single planet, and 100% exactly are totally dependent on that planet if they wish to survive. Given the number of extinction events that have occurred in the past, the volatile nature of the planet itself, and the vast number of known unknowns and unknown unknowns that could wipe us out without us even seeing it coming, that seems a little short-sighted. We effectively ""have all our eggs in one basket"" when it comes to the long-term survival of our race, and if we want to change that then we need to add redundancy - i.e. live on other planets!

You wake up at night with a stranger in your house, your adrenaline instantly spikes and you run on instinct.

Some people would shout, some would panic and hide some would go on the offensive.

If you come face to face with an intruder, you have no idea what's going to happen.  So if you chose to attack, the law should protect the victim (it should be investigated of course).  An intruder being in your home is a valid reason for self defence, they are a very serious threat.  

But should you kill someone when they're not a threat (running away) that's when the law will get more involved.  Although I can understand why someone would and could do something to an intruder that's technically not a threat, given the chemical reaction going on in your body at the time.  There's a lot of emotion flying around when you're home is invaded.

If someone was in my home at night.  The first thing I'd do is call the police then shout at the intruder.

true,emmytee,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I would say that you have worded your question pretty poorly.

I think there is room for concern about increasing fragmentation of British society along racial/religious lines (a result of bad immigration policy dumping Muslim immigrants in poor working class towns without the budget or jobs to support their integration, and creating areas with almost 100% Pakistani immigrants). I think that this gives extremism a breathing space in the disenfranchised and rejected youth and give older immigrants no reason to ever change as they see the local population as against them. 

I am aware that this sounds dumb, but one very interesting (and funny) account of the failed integration that leads to radicalism is in some parts of the film Four Lions. Particularly I thought that the scene in which the main characters devout brother tries to talk him out of committing the attack, only to be met with anger and even derision at his reading the Qur'an too much was bang on. The main characters radicalism comes not from his theology but from his sense of alienation from society and a need for meaning and an identity which he cannot find anywhere else. Chris Morris actually did a shitload of research for that film, including listening to surveillance tapes of actual terrorist cells in the UK. 

So I think we need to tread lightly when we attack British Muslims for disagreeing with us as these things do change in time, but there have to be very clear red lines that you do not cross with regards to how we expect people not to behave in our society. 

I am also still trying to figure out how immigration policy has been so badly botched in england that you have ended up with some cities having such a rapid demographic change. I am all for immigration but if I want to stay in Hong Kong I have to have a work visa or a study visa. I have to be a student or a skilled worker of some sort.

This leads to new technology in unmanned craft for capture new sources of materials for rare earth metals, (rhodium, palladium etc), and new types of materials science where specialist materials are manufactured in microgravity environments. So so far we have developed several new industries and possibly developed new of cheaper cleaner and lighter energy generation technologies. We then have to get over the issue of radiation damage which is again solved by either technological, materials or medical advances.

We used to send kids up chimneys. Babies used to be left in the gutter to die as unwanted. People would starve. Look at all the child abuse stuff that is coming out now.

This focus is on the nasty stuff, but what you should appreciate about our core values as you call them, is that they are in flux and always have been. What you perceive as these values is a mutable viewpoint frozen in time. What you think they might have been in the past is most often not the case.

So Muslim culture in the UK is part of our real core values. We welcome, integrate through slow cultural pressure, the immigrants adapt, and they adapt us. We are changed, as they are changed. There are no 'core values'.

Certain aspects of Muslim culture are reprehensible to our tastes and culture. There is no pressure for you to agree with them....but there is a pressure from our core values to appreciate that people have the right to belief and to have a cultural framework different from our own.

FYI I lived for many years in Kenya as part of the tail off from Colonial days. Did I learn Swahili and integrate? Did I fuck. I kept my weird imported beliefs and relied on the Kenyans to be understanding about my different culture.

Also, please be aware. You can no more label 'Muslims' as a coherent group than you can label 'Christians' and expect the little old lady who goes for the Christmas Carol service to be the same as some firebrand wanker who thinks gays cause hurricanes.

As part of a deeper-space exploration programme NASA are currently developing mechanical flywheel batteries that will **make power plants more efficient** by being able to actually store unused electricity from off-peak hours and pushing it back into the national grid at peak times, capability that doesn't yet exist. Given that power stations take days to turn on and off, it's one of the more promising solutions. Not more fuel efficient, I grant you, but using less fuel in the first place.

Fancy that.

Hurricanes like the recent Sandy are hugely less lethal because of meteorological satellite tracking of the developing storm, giving disaster planners warning of what was going to happen long before human eyes would have seen it. As a result, affected areas had early warning. Satellites can also detect unusual tidal activity such as tidal surges which can similarly devastate communities.

Similarly, climate change is better understood thanks to large satellite arrays giving climatologists the bigger perspective. And we all love our telecoms satellites, from Sky TV to transatlantic phone calls and internet. And modern motoring relies on GPS satellites developed by the USAF Space Command. Europe and Russia aren't a fan of the US military having so much influence over our driving, so are each putting up their own navigational positioning satellite fleets.

And how do these satellites get up there? A hint: They don't jump there. A space programme is required.

Currently the UK space industry supports 68,000 jobs and the UKSA's stated aim is to get that up to 100,000 jobs. A large government commitment helps.

Like it or not, everyone is subscribed to a social contract. When very visible numbers of any one social group start behaving in a way that attracts attention, *they* become the 'representation' of that group. This is entirely distinct from whether or not it's *fair* for the rest of the set that they belong to, to be viewed in the same light. And when you have persons who are outside the set 'looking in', so to speak, it's not the less-visible sectors of the population they will see first, foremost, and most frequently: it's those that constantly draw attention to themselves.

Thus it is that the significant (but highly-audible, highly-visible) minority of women who can't keep their knickers on get to become 'representative' of an **entire** class of their sisters, including those who do not share their fondness for drunken debauchery.",0,1353576376,null,0,false,0,c75541a,t3_13l7if,t1_c75541a,t1_c754x8p,null,1430471736,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I see you point but as an ex DWP employee you should never feel guilty about claiming benefits you are entitled to. You have paid into the system and that money could be used to help you get a new job. A new suit for interviews, bus fare and petrol to commute to them, a contribution for your parent for your upkeep. I think not claiming benefits can be admirable if your a millionaire and you don't claim your winter fuel allowance for example but that money was rightly yours to claim.

EDIT: BTW you would not have been able to claim Housing Benefit.

If you asked me if I fear the rise of Islam 5 years ago I would have scoffed and dismissed you as some nationalist but that's one of the problems here - if you're anything but welcoming and proud to live among muslims you're suddenly some EDL fascist.

Over the years I've been assaulted and forced to defend myself in the middle of Brick Lane for walking and talking with my mates during a Qur'an (sp?) reading by 'good'devout muslims, shouted at and chased away for defending my right to take photos of a Mosque in Southampton and spat on for the heinous crime of walking and holding hands with my girlfriend through *lovely* Woking. There are a few more, although less extreme incidents, I had the good fortune to experience but as you can probably imagine they had the collective effect of not making me feel all that welcomed by, or trusting of their faith.

This led me to do a bit of reading about their faith and that only led me to further question the nature of Islam. The whole ""voluntary submission to god"", total lack of women's rights and Mohammed paedophiling 9 year old Aisha thing didn't quite sit right with me and that was without the media's influence. 'Behead all those that insult Islam' - Gets quite hard to ignore...

I know there are good muslims out there and I have definitely met a few myself, I used to sell weed to a lot of them at uni and I did get the chance to have a smoke and a chat with a few who all seemed to be really nice guys. Probably because most of them didn't take their faith that seriously. The one serious muslim girl I did meet was regularly beaten (and quite severely) by her even more devout brother. Perhaps Islam will evolve to be a bit more liberal a bit further down the line, to fit in around traditional English values? Perhaps but I think not as I can't help but see Islam as a faith that works in absolutes. 

I don't *like* that I feel wary of a certain group of people, I feel strangely ashamed in typing this all out but it's just what circumstance has made me feel. The fact that most of my well-educated, morally-balanced, loving friends, family and general social circle feel almost the same way about Islam says a lot to me to. I don't want the UK to pick up any cultural elements from Islam either and I am wary of the fact it's on the rise, I just can't help but feel dirty for feeling this way.

Against Rafa

-You can't just take Gerrard off .. especially vs Everton.

-Look at how he lost Xabi Alonso.

-""I wouldn't give Rafa money because he will just go and buy a player like Voronin"" - Jamie Redknapp.



For Rafa

-You have to rest your players or they get burned out - everyone does this now so it doesn't matter.

-Liverpool 04-10 did a mix of both, most teams do. Mark the big players and the big areas.

-The system should come first ahead of a player, especially if the player is emotional.

-Not everyone will have Mourinho-like social skills. No player is bigger than the club.

-With the context of having to buy to sell he did really well. He was getting a bit of money each season up to 08/09 and you could see the season-on-season improvement.

Killing someone for an act of theft is not proportional, things can be replaced and restitution or insurance paid, killing someone while defending yourself or others from potentially lethal force is defensible in my opinion.

I'm probably one of the few English people who think it should be legal to own handguns and permissible to use them for self defense.

I don't want to sound like a dick, but your response is a typical popular response which fails to tell us anything. All you're saying is ""people re different"". Well, yes?

The fact of the matter is we have far more religion-specific issues with Islam than we do Christianity. 

What I've noticed, is that Islam doesn't seem to bothered by homosexuality. And that's interesting. I think, actually, Islam is less bothered by what non-Muslims do than Christianity is overall, they don't care so much of issues that don't effect them. I think there's a huge difference in responding to other people's sexuality choice, and other people depicting something of importance to you (muhammad). Not that it makes it okay to be so angry and violent against those who depict muhammad, but you see my point?

I think, the sort of things Muslims get angry about are actually sort of understandable.

However, If I woke up and found some in my house I think there is a good chance I would batter them until they couldn't get up with whatever came to hand.  Unfortunately this might cause the trespasser some actual harm and I guess might actually kill them accidentally in the process.  I have a feeling that I would not take a chance in wondering  what the trespassers motive was,  whether they might have a weapon of some description and if they would use it or not.  I’m certainly not going to stop attacking them until I believe they have ceased to be a threat to me.  Being honest if I had access to a shotgun (which could be likely as I live out in the sticks and have a rabbit problem) I’d probably use it first before making the trespasser aware that I was there.  If they were running away, I would probably discharge it at them to make sure they weren't going to come back to hurt me or the family.  In the dark I might hit them.

My own feelings are that as soon as you break into someone property you negate your rights to personal safety.  If you don’t like that sort of risk you should find a different hobby.  If you kill a trespasser on your property in a non pre-meditated manner, I don’t think you should automatically be charged with assault, manslaughter or murder.  However, unlike some of of my neighbours, I personally draw the line at capturing the trespassers, locking them in a barn, doing “weird shit” to them then burying the bodies out on the moor.

&gt;The answer to the failure of bailouts is more and more bailouts.

&gt;The answer to the failure of QE is more and more QE

&gt;The answer to the failure of Europe is more and more Europe.

Sorry the Euro currency was a terrible idea conjured up by plutocrats. Poorer countries like Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal would be able to devalue their currencies against stronger european countries (UK, France, Germany) and would be able to get out of their mess. As it stands they're left with a strong currency and a weak economy. 

Which means they'll be lining up for soup kitchens (like Greece is already).

All the while the German and dutch can export to them in a strong currency (effectively paying twice for exports as their exports wouldn't be as valuable if they had to trade in a devalued currency - to explain like your 5 if Germans had to trade with Greece in Greece's own currency their exports would not be worth as much - the markets would correct themselves). 

It is no wonder that Merkel wants a Europe locked into their currency and whilst we may pay higher prices for imports within the EU it at least would prevent catastrophic failures like that of 2008 to current. In short we wouldn't have booms and busts - especially ones of the altitude millions of pensioners get there pensions wiped out.

Until the EU is completely politically aligned (IE. you don't get into a situation where strong countries like Germany prey on the weaker countries) then it's something we should hold at arms length. 

And that will never happen because Europe is made up of countries thousands of years old with their own identities and cultures and therefore will always look out for number 1. 

There are a few things I love about the EU (consumer rights, decent human rights etc.) but without political alignment in a unified Europe each country will do as they have done - look out for no.1 at the cost of other countries. Not to mention the centralisation of power which is never a good thing.

No it doesn't. They can still be Christians if they want. They are still free to meet peacefully to practise their beliefs. All I am saying is that they should not be free to use their religion to establish organisations that (would otherwise) engage in illegal practices.

&gt; People know that bishops represent the apostles, of which all were male, and therefore the church's policy is that bishops' must be men. Women cannot complain when they join because it isn't the same as a business organisation; whereas in a business organisation it may be because of sexist practises, in a church it's just what their religion believes. 

If I, as the CEO of a business, truly believe that men make better managers than women, it's illegal if I act on my belief. What's the difference between this and a religious belief? I really don't understand what distinction you're trying to highlight.

&gt; Once you start telling them they can't believe that because it conflicts with the law, as you would do, it's a very slippery slope.

No one has said it should be illegal to believe but, rather, it should be illegal to act on your beliefs. It's not illegal to think racist thoughts, for example, but it is illegal to be racist.

Having said that, in Sheffield anyway, it would seem that Christianity is hitting back, with a number of churches being planted here. I'm not sure why religion is hitting back, but that's what I'd be worried about, as well as entering an age of ignorance, as America seems to have done. By this I'm not belittling Americans, but it is simply what I have seen from here: The amount of fact that is being beaten by opinion, the amount of opinion that is formed from misrepresentation is horrifying, especially as we're meant to be living in the information age. This kind of ignorance is creeping over here (dare I say it under the ever-watchful eye of Mr Murdoch).

Islam is nothing to be scared of. The worst thing you can do is shun those of a Muslim faith, that way the segregation we already appear to be experiencing will get worse. Talk to people, embrace your community. Learn things.

Lastly, don't believe what the cretinous EDL and BNP have to say on the matter. I'd rather have Muslims in this country than bigots.

All are broadly compelling arguments, but the biggest reason is more philosophical to me.  

We invest in space - along with *all* of pure science because, fundamentally we want to find out more about the world. As it is, television, computers, GPS and the likes are all happy side effects of what drive that. When Sir William Crookes invented the Cathode Ray tube in the 1870's was he *trying* to create the television in order to corner the market and make himself billions? No. He was basically doing what a lot of people would call ""pissing about with rarefied gases"", nevermind that J.J. Thomspon used similar apparatus 20 years later to discover the electron. 

When you 'invest in space', or even plain 'invest in science' you invest in people, not machines. It's a pretty big misconception in the public eye. - you aren't sticking money in a catapult and throwing it at mars or burying it in the ground in Switzerland - You're employing people. Incredibly skilled people who are very passionate about what they do. These people are generally employed (amongst other things) to solve problems that beset efforts to proceed with their objective - Generally problems that nobody has had to solve before. The money that they're paid doesn't go into some vault, it goes into housing them, feeding them, raising their families - *it all gets funneled back into the local economy*. That's not to say they'd be on the streets without govt. funding, but they'd likely be doing something without the challenges, without the network of peers and without the opportunity to let them satiate their deep need to know more about the world. There's only so much you can get from science in the shed in your back garden. Without these largely govt. &amp; university created sectors, these people simply wouldn't get trained to do what they do anywhere near as well as they do. The problems wouldn't get solved or the mechanisms wouldn't get discovered.

A good allegory is the problem of developing a country. You have a £500 million to help develop a developing country, your team has narrowed it down to two projects - massive road infrastructure investment creating a network of transport links across the entire country or the creation of a national airline?

What do you choose? The road because it will bring easy transport to all? Something everyone can see the benefit of? or the airline? Something that will only be used to jet-set the upper class of the country, creating a badge for the inequality you're trying to end?

The answer might be surprising - the best choice is the airline. The road's funds will get siphoned off by corrupt local government officials and to construction companies and without continuous investment for maintenance it falls into disrepair quite quickly. 

The airline can not be allowed to fall into disrepair. If even a single plane were to crash, there would be massive outcry towards the government as it's the friends and family of the industrialists and the celebrities who are going to be taking the flight. As maintenance can't be skimped on, this forces the employment and training of mechanics and engineers to maintain the complicated flight machinery - who need to be paid relatively well and therefore feed more money back into the local economy. This, among other things allows the beginning of a creation of a middle class in your chosen third world hell-hole. People who are educated enough to know which direction to push for reform in - people who are able to educate people themselves, causing a general increase in the quality of life.

1. ""5man stacking pub"" Well I mentioned in my post that I'll probably be playing with friends, and ""pubs"" are just about all people play these days given that IH leagues don't exist/aren't stable.

2. ""1-1-1 NS solo mid"" Well, I'm fairly sure that's not my score at the end of the game, nor really at any significant ""point"" in the game (e.g. end of first night) even though you didn't mention a particular time.

3. ""18/6 cs at 10 min"" Yes I can accept that this is quite bad, certainly by ""carry"" standards where 50 cs at 10 min is the ""norm"". So I missed a few last hits. I personally think for a melee hero, NS actually has quite a poor attack animation. And I was against a Morphling who CSs fairly well in lane. But anyway, these opinions aside, I should have done better in the first 6 minutes. Going into first night, I certainly stopped focusing on CS, as I believe is the norm with NS.

4. ""72 cs at 42"" Right, well, I don't even see how this is a valuable comment. Unless you are trying to imply that NS is meant to sit in a lane and farm through the game. I don't really agree with this.

Anyway. By no means is my play perfect, but the main point of the stream is that 1. I am a brit and the friends I play with are all brits, and 2. all (or almost all) of these games are going to be in the VH bracket (you can check in client if you want) where no matter how much you dislike the MM system in-game, is actually fairly accurate in terms of skill level.

 * Muslims make up &lt; 2.8% of the population of the UK, so really it will be a while before the muslim demographic rises to the point of ""danger"".
 * Kids, grandkids, etc WILL integrate.  Your friend can say what she wants and people can stand on their pulpit bashing away.  I have a lot of faith in the newer generations, especially their attitude to logical debate and adaptation.  I fully expect there will be tensions but integration will happen. 
 * I wouldn't get too wound up by a bunch of people on a bunch of forums.  By and large people are people and just want to get on and live their lives in peace and contentment.  Nobody wants more pain than is absolutely necessary so by sheer default people will integrate -- or leave if they feel so strongly about their views.
 * I think you're way too hung up on the ""muslim"" label.  Yes there are zealots but even in most overtly religious muslim countries religion is _part_ of people's identities -- not the core focus.
 * I would take with a grain of salt any argument about ""Christian values"" (or any religious foundation for that matter).  Not too long ago Christian values included burning witches at the stake, death to scientists who disagreed (with evidence) against theology and forceful conversions.  Even now Christian values are regularly lambasted as being hypocritical (c.f. attitude to homosexuality, sex abuse, wealth and taxation)
 * I find your argument that there is no pressure on Islam to be confusing.  What do we tolerate from them that we don't in our own society? As long as they're operating in the law I don't think there's more we could impose on them - that would undemocratic.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"Asteroid mining for starters. In one large metallic 1 km cubed asteroid, there are more precious metals than have been mined in the entire history of the Earth. Most valuable of these are the Platinum group metals, for which there are many uses, but for which supply is low.  

The reason for this is that as the Earth formed, the heavier elements mostly sank toward the core, rather than remaining in the crust. In the lighter asteroids and planetoids, the material is far less differentiated. Even the ""crap"" on the asteroid is useful. One tonne of iron ore in orbit is potentially worth far more than one tonne of iron ore on Earth - it represents a tonne of material you can use to build spacecraft *in situ* without first having to spend vast sums of money launching the mass of components into orbit. 

The research into LFTR Thorium reactor construction was originally done so that you could have aircraft (and thus spacecraft) with an on-board nuclear reactor. Once in orbit your ship doesn't have to worry about chemical fuel rockets any more, and the associated vast quantities of rocket fuel required to get anywhere interesting. Such reactors put planets such as Mars well within reach, to the extent that a ship equipped with one could get to Mars in a few weeks, rather than the months or years required with current technology.

&gt;The sentence was reduced to eight months, but due to 124 days already spent in custody, Filor was eligible for immediate release.

8 months for breach of a court order is hardly ""absolutely free"", serving half the time isn't uncommon, and more a problem for the entire justice system.

The real crazy parts are:

&gt;He was given an open-ended imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence last year, designed to keep him behind bars until considered safe for release.

&gt;The Court of Appeal in April ruled the sentence was 'unlawful' because he must be punished for what he did and not what he might do in the future.

a) Who in prison can decide if anybody will commit the same crime they've been previously committed? According to this [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19303878), citing a Commons Justice Committee report in August 2012: in the year 2011, 44% of all offenders had more than 14 convictions. Shouldn't they too be given IPPs?

b) So he gets 4 months for child pornography laws, but 8 months (serving 4) for breaching a court order?

You don't understand the mathematic foundation of confidence intervals of statistical sample sizes.  You don't understand that there is strong evidence for the accuracy of opinion polls with relatively small sample sizes.

You don't understand a linchpin of sociological research.  This extends far past healthy skepticism into blind ignorance.

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"No I don’t think I should be allowed to murder someone just for being on my property. Please read my original reply.   

From your comment,  am I to surmise you believe that people who commit burglary / rape / torture / murder on someone else’s property should enjoy the equivalent of Health and Safety legislation in their chosen career / hobby?  IE if they are protected by the law whist carrying out the action but then to be prosecuted for carrying it out (or is that OK too?)

If you read my original comment, what I oppose is being automatically arrested and prosecuted for hitting someone on the head with say a torch hard enough to incapacitate them and hypothetically kill them in the process.  I also see a similarity to some extent in my own personal circumstances with a real case a few years ago where a rural home owner used a shot gun against intruders.

By booby trapping your property to a lethal extent or buying either a legal or illegal firearm or other weapon (or storing an existing one in the bedroom perhaps) with the express intent of using it against an intruder, I see a level of pre-meditation to commit an act of violence against an intruder.  This I believe is wrong because it clearly shows a mindset along the lines of “Hmm, if I ever get burgled I’m going to act in a vigilante manner” 
 
A hypothetical situation.  If I have a lot of dogs which are not kept for guarding purposes, clearly marked signs saying “warning dogs” and someone breaks and enters my property at night and they get bitten – should I be prosecuted and my animals get destroyed?

Gloucester road has a great deal of shops, chains and independents, and loads of great places to eat and drink.

Clifton and Cotham are really nice areas but very expensive to live in. Filton and Lockleaze are ok in my opinion but there are some rough patches.

true,Galcius,null,null,"&gt;Many/most anthropologists would disagree with you. Anarchy Works by Gelderloos lists a substantial number of historical and contemporary societies run along anarchistic lines, indeed, historically speaking, Western style individualism has been the exception rather than the rule. Capitalism's dominance for the last several hundred years has tended to erase this reality, as is often the case with history written by the winners.

It is exactly this western dominance which seems to be a result of individualism. The vast amount of wealth generated allowed the European empires to rocket ahead in terms of development and power. I'm not claiming anarchism hasn't ""worked"" at all ever, I'm claiming that it does not provide the level of wealth and success that the western system(avoiding the word ""capitalism"" as we differ on definitions) has. 

&gt;I'm certainly using capitalism as a synonym for how capitalism operates in all places now, and has at all times during its history. If we're talking about some hypothetical capitalism drawn from a libertarian or anarcho-capitalist wet-dream, or from the pages of a theoretical text, then I fear there won't be much meeting of minds. I prefer to deal with reality, albeit you may view my ideology as utopian!

That's hilariously ironic, given your proposals are Chompsky's wet dream and nothing more. 

Any proposal I would make would be modifications of the current system, that seems far more achievable to me than any utopian wonderland populated by fully rational entities.

&gt;Buy why should people, especially ones who've taken the time to democratically agree some even-handed process, necessarily be any more (or less) emotional than a judge? Indeed, isn't it likely that the mean of a cross-section of opinion should be less partial and prone to strong emotion than that of a single judge, however highly regarded s/he may be, and whatever rarefied circles s/he moves in?

For that even handed process to work, authority has to be established and respected. That isn't mob justice, that's just going back to having a system of justice in place. If a system of even handed courts of law is permissable to you, then it's not a point we disagree on.

&gt;Are you ""easily mislead by rhetoric and emotional appeals""? If not, why do you consider that others are? Are you better than the unwashed masses? Indeed, if large numbers of people are vulnerable to this, how much more are small groups of so-called elites? If you don't trust the majority, how can you possibly trust a minority? And yet you do, and look how profoundly they've screwed things up trying to run everything for their own ends.

Yes, I am, as are you, as is everyone. I don't consider human beings to be more than partly rational, and in the main I believe that we are *rationalizing* rather than rational. In other words, I think we act mostly on instinct and emotion and quickly come up with excuses for our actions when challenged. Evolutionary Psychology backs me up on that one.

I don't consider the ""elites"" any better, they are acting on the same impulses and emotions as the rest of us, and I don't think they have any inherent or particular right to be elites. However, I also don't believe in any happy little rationalist utopias, at least, not for human beings anyway.

&gt;Anarchism is certainly about more than freeing people from constraints, it is also very much about equipping them with the means, education, social milieu, upbringing and confidence to take responsibility for their own lives and to work together in a mutual supportive manner to face challenges. It's about strengthening and trusting humanity, rather than weakening and fearing it.

Which all sounds nice but totally against our nature, I think it would require brainwashing on a massive scale to achieve.

&gt;In a participatory and consensus-based direct democracy or anarchist system, people would always have voice where they wished one

And I challenge the notion that people *want to* unless they possess narrow interests on the issue.

&gt;This I would dispute. In many of the most salient ways, our modern incarnation of capitalism looks a lot like the earlier mercantilist one which Adam Smith was revolting against, with intellectual property and so-called ""free-trade"" agreements in place of the tariffs that Smith so despised. I've said before, I've a lot of sympathy for Smith, as did Marx who rated him highly in his Theories of Surplus Value, and based his Capital in part on extending Smith's ideas and taking them to their logical conclusion, one which most classical economists feared and worked hard to obfuscate (i.e. socialism).

Then you're conflicting yourself. You say this is capitalism, and say I'm not speaking about it because you have a nice pejorative definition borrowed from Marx, and now say that this isn't capitalism but a mercantile system and therefore *real* capitalism doesn't look like this. Which I fully agree with; many of the current system's flaws are due to it's borrowing heavily from mercantile practices, and we should know better by now but apparently not.

&gt;This is where we most clearly diverge then. I don't see capitalism as a ""system designed to redirect selfishness to better ends"", I see it as a system designed to celebrate and reinforce selfishness. Without it, I believe humanity is destined for better things. I think we're better than capitalism, not the other way round.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;French law is islamophobic and getting more so, and I find it deeply objectionable.

Some people find parts of Islam deeply objectionable. I do not believe in complete and unlimited tolerance for the beliefs of others. Whether Islamic or not.

There seems to be a growing number of people who will not entertain the idea of criticizing certain groups of people and those that do get branded ignorant, racist or whatever without any further thought. This is dangerous in my opinion and it's only right that these issues are allowed to be discussed in an open and mature way.

Not defending the OP in this case because he seems to generally be xenophobic rather than making a specific point to which I could agree with.

That being said, I don't find it terribly clever to mock ignorant xenophobes. It's very easy for some people to feel that their country is changing and for them to feel scared about the direction it's changing.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Notice how the list of experts is compiled of people or aren't experts in anything and those more worried about what would happen to the EU than giving advice on would happen to the UK?

**Martin Schulz?**  

Sure he's president of the European Parliament but he's just a German MEP.  He didn't go to university or anything.  He used to run a bookshop.  That's not an expert unless the EU is going into the book selling business.

Next.

**Hervé Mariton.**  

This one did go to a polytechnic.  He's an engineer that got into regional politics at an early age (27) and if it's any consolation it was in the Alps so he is probably a half decent skier.  When it comes to trade, economics, constitutional law, political academia or anything else that might be useful he's the equivalent of a plumber in an operating theatre.

**Emma Bonino.**

Vice-president of Italian Senate.  A degree in linguisitcs and another career politician but she's been a mover and a shaker and has operated at the higher levels for some time so all is looking good, even putting aside that she describes herself as a radical and pushed for a nuclear energy ban,  but perhaps this expert has some experience.  She does.  She had to resign under allegations of corruption and fraud from the EU Santer Commission in which she was specifically named.  Our expert is an expert in lying to people.  And lo and behold some of her facts in the article are decidedly iffy with quite a few obvious omissions.

**Ulf Sverdrup.**  

Head of Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.   Finally.  He's not in the EU but this one might actually be worth something.  He's hardly a prophet of doom and gloom he just says the Norwegian solution is probably best suited for the UK and if they were to leave/negotiate then the UK would probably want to pursue a UK solution.  Fuck a duck.  The Director at the Institute of International Affairs and professor in political science may be onto something...

**Derk-Jan Eppink**

European and International Law, political journalist, published political author.  All good stuff.  Even his wife works at the UN so he lives and breathes it.  Now read what he says in the article again.  EU needs UK.  UK is asking the same questions as myself and I receive the same answers.  He does question whether the EU would give a trade deal to the UK and that they might act out of spite, but then he also says Holland needs the UK because without it economic liberalism would be dead on the continent.  Don't leave because we need your votes because the other guys aren't pragmatic.  He's not painting a great picture of the EU...

**Hugo Brady.**

Doesn't add anything even though he has studied and worked and reported on politics and the EU all his life.  He says Ireland tends to agree with the UK and their leaving would be bad for Ireland.  He adds nothing.  He might be a great expert but what's the point of having an expert if they only come out with stuff like 'burgers come from cows'?

**Radek Sikorski**

I like him because he starts with all the flattery flannel.  But again he says something really concerning that Amsterdam mentioned earlier.  We need Britain because it's ""an important guardian of liberal rules.""  It's like they're talking through the sides of their mouths and secretly whispering, ""Don't leave us alone with them!""  There's almost a confession there that at any moment it's going to turn into something much darker and dictatorial.  I like him, he studied PPE and has a broad and powerful CV, it's not entirely relevant but he used to be British when he took asylum so he has a deeper understanding of what's good for Britain.  He doesn't make any sort of a convincing case though: the US wants you to stay so you can control the EU from inside (2014 voting reform will put a stop to much of that) and that Iran sanctions were more powerful because the UK was a member.  So?  I'd also add that there was no international agreement on South African sanctions each country just did what it thought was right and they were damn effective sanctions.

&gt; and the increase in land prices this causes

'this' being the willingness of banks to advance credit to purchase (or lease) land, presumably?

&gt; There are two (non horrific) ways to do this

There are other ways, that you conveniently forgot. Limit families to one owning one dwelling. Convert luxury houses to social dwellings. Aggressively develop brownfield sites. allow some construction on greenfield sites. I'm sure there are others.

&gt; Do you think that if this ban were to happen, that the impact on our workforce would be negative?

Yes. They wouldn't be able to go out for authentic food, for one. Or know about the world. Foreign companies won't set up offices if they can't bring in trusted manager.

true,John84700,null,null,"&gt;This is ridiculous! Crowding Torres out of space?

I think this is exactly what's happening. I'm not very happy with Torres's runs or overall play.  I'm just trying to say there are additional factors beyond ""SHITTY TORRES"" that are hurting us on offense and hurting whoever our striker is, like our lack of width. When you look at the positioning and play choices of the 3 AM's (Mazacar), you can see exactly what I'm talking about. Mazacar invariably move the ball up to the 18 yard line and spend at least 3/4 of their time above that line and between the side lines of the box. Then it's just lateral movement and backheel city. This makes us predictable and easily defended against. 

&gt;Torres needs to make runs into space that is what strikers are supposed to do, the reason other players are ""crowding his space"" as you call it is because he makes absolutely no runs for them to pass the ball behind defences to him.

With this style of play, there are only two places for Torres or any striker to go: 1. Deeper into the already very congested box. 2. Diagonal runs from the box, out to the wings where there actually is space. The first option is nearly fruitless because keepers and CB's are now crowding the box and making it impossible to service our lone striker. Additionally, the small chip/dink passes that facilitate positioning and offense like this a la Barcelona or Spain, are not being made. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLAdTC7vyIg I think I've seen Torres get one good pass like that. Yeah, he botched it, but if you're lining the offense up to facilitate little passes like this and are not making the passes, the midfield needs to look at itself when wondering why we lack incisive movement. Torres is making the second type of run, out to the wing. We all know though that this isn't where we need him. He is at fault there for being out of position, but nothing is wrong with moving into space to provide your team with an open man if that's the only space there is.

Spreading the field wider and moving forward in an incisive way is how we need to play in general. It's not just what will help Torres. It will help our entire offense be more lethal. That or more forward passes need to be made. Think of Shaktar. They have great interplay but always seem to be simultaneously advancing forward. I'm not a Torres apologist.

After a quick scan of the actual source for the suicide bombing statistic, I found that the question asked specifically about attacks against *civilian targets*.  And indeed, 24% of British Muslims answered in the affirmative.  I see this as a clearly unconscionable and dangerous opinion, regardless of the location of the bomb blast.

http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=60

Another poll from the linked compendium sheds additional light:

- 12% of young Muslims in Britain (and 12% overall) believe that suicide attacks *against civilians in Britain* can be justified.

http://www.populuslimited.com/pdf/2006_02_07_times.pdf

You're right that the context of location presents different results.  ""Only"" 12 percent.  I still think that's cause for concern.

Regarding Muslim opinion of the proper punishment for apostasy, well, I don't find the poll results hard to believe considering that, as Wikipedia states:

&gt; The majority of Muslim scholars hold to the traditional view that apostasy is punishable by death or imprisonment until repentance, at least for adult men of sound mind.

I really don't want to seem like an Islamophobe, and I recognize that the majority of Muslims are relatively moderate.  But everything I've seen convinces me that, for horrifying percentages of adherents, Islam is a Stone-Age religion with barbaric values regarding violence, women, speech, etc.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"It's a grey area for several reasons. (Did you see Felon btw?)

First off, you are allowed to use ""reasonable force"" to defend yourself and your property. But reasonable force is only enough force to defend yourself, and killing a person is almost always too far. Someone will generally stop trying to rob or beat you while they're unconscious, or have a broken nose/arm/leg, so to actually go one step further and kill someone becomes murder (or manslaughter). If however you kill the person with a single blow with a lamp it would be up to a jury to decide whether reasonable or unreasonable force was used.

The second, and more important part of this grey area is that it would legalise murder and be open to abuse. ""My estranged wife attacked me so I beat her to death"", or ""The Jehovah's witness had a gun so I stabbed him!"" (come on, we'd all be tempted!). It would be easy to stage a fake robbery so by allowing such a large loophole, fewer genuine killers would be charged.

Murder is illegal (except when country leaders murder people in other countries), and rightly so. Individuals should (and are) let off in exceptional cases, but these should be exceptions to the rule and not the other way around. 

Each death needs to be treated properly. If it is proven you have killed another human being, you are guilty of murder or manslaughter, it is up to you to prove that death was the only way you could defend yourself and that a simple threat or wounding wouldn't have done. And of course that you made every effort to alert the police as soon as possible.",0,1353596896,null,0,false,0,c7576fk,t3_13lzif,t1_c7576fk,t3_13lzif,null,1430472703,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;With the ever increasing space issues we have in this country.

An absolute non-issue.

&gt;Do you think that if this ban were to happen, that the impact on our workforce would be negative? 

Yes. If we ban all immigration then we'd be left with a severe shortage of doctors and nurses, roles that have been historically (in the UK) been filled by immigrants on a large scale. The NHS is one of the largest employers in Europe, and provides a shit load of training (and benefits from the training) to international doctors. Immigrant doctors account for 30% of NHS staff and in London alone over 60,000 nurses (over a quarter) are foreigners.

I think an immigration ban works to solve a political problem, and not a practical one, and is an easy and cheap way to garner votes from many people, without necesarily having to hang around for the results of a ban to truly impact society.

&gt;With the population of Earth going from 3 - 7 Billion in 50ish years, and with this increase being compound, overpopulation is surely a much bigger threat to our planet than global warming.

Nope. Overpopulation is a myth and people suggest that the population will plateau with a number between 8 and 11 billion around 2050.

http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf [PDF warning]

&gt;In 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.

But look at it from another angle:

&gt;An estimated 5.5m British people live permanently abroad – almost one in 10 of the UK population. The emigration of British people has happened in cycles over 200 years. The trend is now rising again: some 2,000 British citizens moved permanently away from the UK every week in 2005.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/default.stm

What if every country adopted this scheme? What about all the British people who emigrate somewhere else? We can't really say we have a space problem (we don't) because it would allow other countries to claim the same, and if we banned free movement for members of European countries I can't really even imagine what the backlash from the EU would be. Would we be kicked out? Would all UK to Europe immigration also be banned? Restricting the flow of people from one country to another (especially in regards to skilled and needed workers like Doctors and Nurses) would only really cause problems. 

Regulate it? Sure.

Ban it? Eh, I don't think so.

For example, I have heard from quite a few work colleagues and friends that Britain is going to adopt Sharia Law. This is crazy nonsense, and almost certainly never going to happen. On of my least favourite things about Britain is our popular newspapers: the Mail, the Express and the Sun all seem to have a massive thing about spreading lies and fear about immigrants.

So my first response is: you're not wrong, because its not a threat to our way of life. Muslims constitute 3.3% of the population. (Sauce)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_England]  Its not a very scary perceantage.

You raise a great point about tolerating the intolerant though. I was going out with a sri lankan girl recently, and I couldn't meet her parents because it would be disgraceful for her to be going out with her. She was Buddhist: what you are talking about is not inherent just in Muslims; it probably includes the attitudes of some Hungarian Catholics as well etc etc etc. In one sense this isn't out and out prejudice: its not my white skin, but my cultural excesses that her pappy feared (and tbh, I did introduce her to a lot of the things he wanted her uncorrupted from, like smoking weed and drinking.) I still kind of think its bullshit, because the best way for people to be peaceful with each other is by fucking each other, so for communities to integrate this should happen. But its not an issue you can force. Integration is a natural process I think: boundaries erode over time. Soon Muslim women embrace our culture and have five kids by five different guys by the time they are seventeen. A better tomorrow lol.  

So anyway, we tolerate the intolerant we're tolerant I guess. Thats just how it works.

i think you are inferring a positive correlation there where one arguably doesnt actually exist. you have 2 unproven assumptions 1) ""ever increasing space issues"" - proof? citation? data? newspaper article? and 2)that the (unproven) notion that a decrease in the amount of ""space"" available for (presumably) housing, will lead to an increase in land prices. again, this is an argument that needs backing up

For example, i could argue that the building of housing is what actually increases land prices. my argument? increasing house prices! I shall explain: housing people buy a plot of land, they build a house on it, the price of the plot goes up to reflect the fact that there is now a house built upon it, I buy it, the price goes up because i live in the house, improve it with decorations, the market prices increase etc etc. Therefore if they hadn't built the house, the land would be cheaper. its a bullshit argument, that would fall to pieces if you tried to back it up with sensible data. but this is my point.",0,1353600951,null,0,false,0,c757w6h,t3_13mbqh,t1_c757w6h,t3_13mbqh,null,1430473039,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think Islam is not compatible with equality.  In the same way as beliving in equality in status freedoms and opportunity is not compatible with other ideas.  We can't tolerate 'everything'.  Should we tolerate the intolerent?  Why should we make allowances for beliefs that are not compatible with our own just because they are a religion? We should question everything and not assume a belief system should be tolerated just because it is a religion.

To your questions:

1. I don't think I alone should decide which influences affect UK cultural norms but of course I have an opinion.  It's pleased me seeing the progress that the UK has made against racism (still got a way to on on this).  I also like to see that the BNP have never made a true 'breakthrough' as they seek - it gives me faith in the tolerance of the UK.  I am not asking for 'restrictions', I'm merely asking whether the rise of islam is something we should be mindful of.  Is this a group of cultural norms that would benefit the UK?  I don't think it is.  Many would agree with me.

2. Muslims have been in the UK for a long time now.  I actually don't want any religion to have dominance over the UK.  Show me a local area that is 'heavily christian' and where peoples lives are effected by the church in a way that prevents them from going about their business.  There are plenty of parts of the uk where as you say, the influx of muslims has caused the nature of local business to change - pub closed down / nightclub closed down and so on.  You say 'i have the power to move as far away as possible'.

Why should I have to do that?

There seems to be path of integration failure:

Tiny minority = celebrated, nice restaurants, so small integration happens quickly

Small minority = celebrated, more restaurants, maybe a cool muslim area, a mini mosque, food from islamic countries'

medium sized minority - town begins to change, local schools change to reflect muslim population.  'community leaders' seek to reflect the local population by having muslim networking groups, ensuring that the population's character remains - look at how Brick Lane remains muslim bangladeshi.  Mayor of Tower hamlets is also a muslim, despite being kicked out of the Labour party for corruption (look it up).

It's at this point - when a minority gets to a certain size, that things start getting difficult.  Because if at this point people don't integrate, we have parallel communities.  We have one group, e.g. Islam having its own community centres, it won't join in and help promote gay rights, or womens rights.",0,1353601534,null,0,false,0,c7580bx,t3_13l7if,t1_c7580bx,t1_c752f0v,null,1430473093,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I disagree with the punishments laid down by Sharia law, but there's many countries in the world with capital punishment and it's not until relatively recently that they've moved away from more barbaric, entertainment and public-execution methods to nice, clean ones that we can hide in the corner of society and not really think about.

The apostasy thing is similar to the recent women bishops vote in the CoE. It's a hangover from the founding of the religion, but changing it goes against the religious texts, you can see why there's an issue. Religions are founded to be conservative and to resist change, but it makes them integrating with the modern world an issue, particularly when something goes against the law of the land. Discriminating against women isn't the same level, but it's the same principle.

I would say my issue is with silo'd immigrant communities that don't integrate. It does create areas that are uncomfortable and it allows things we as a society disagree with to exist in their own enclave, where the community is able to enforce something even though it's not part of the law. It's not an Islam specific issue, but an integration one.

The point is that these are ordinary people who have just been subject to an INCREDIBLY traumatic event, which will probably be with them for the rest of their lives, and what they are immediately forced to deal with is being held prisoner, and subjected to the fear that, on the whim of a prosecutor, they could be facing a charge of murder and lifelong imprisonment. That threat is then not lifted for several weeks. In terms of adding to the psychological damage of the incident the consequences of this are considerable.

There are ample different approaches that can be used for investigating victims of extreme trauma without using heavy handed custody or police bail.

 Given the INCREDIBLE rarity of actual prosecutions going forth in these situations there is really no need for the police to treat people like this as ordinary criminals. There is almost certainly going to be no prosecution, so the advantages of holding them in custody prior to interview are completely minimal compared to the added damage caused, and the denial of help and comfort to the victim in the period immediately after the trauma. 

They use this approach in the case of rape victims alleged to have used violence in self defense. They investigate first, THEN they arrest if the investigation bears fruit. There is little reason not to treat victims of a traumatic house invasion with similar sensitivity.

* **Increase in paving**

The proportion of impermeable ground in existing developments is increasing as people *build patios and pave over front gardens*

The reason you live in a community is because it confers benefits to your lifestyle. Unfortunately for some, it also requires you to act a legally-enforced co-operative way. Your house is a function of the area it sits in; you're not an island. 


My exaggerated points *are* relevant, because I'm outing the notion that ""I can do whatever I want with my property, externalities be damned"" is a poor attitude. It's a selfish and ignorant mindset, that doesn't hold up to the nature of the law today (you can't just pave existing lawns willy-nilly, they need to be permeable for the reason I mentioned), and the law from hundreds of years ago when the common law was first developed.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;But saying that, arrest is the primary mechanism for controlling a suspect and then professionally and dispassionately investigating a potential crime.

This is fair enough, but given the fact that a prosecution is staggeringly unlikely, would it not be reasonable to use alternative mechanisms, of which there are plenty?

Plenty of suspects of crimes are investigated under caution without use of the custody suite. Given these are likely to be people for whom absconding is unlikely, and further violence even less likely, the deployment of extremly traumatising mechanisms on an already traumatised victim of crime seems somewhat heavy handed and unnecessary.

I would add that using an alternative approach would surely be a better change than what is proposed. 

Because of public outrage at use of short term detention of people in these situations, there is clamour to change the law to allow disproportionate force, rather than reasonable. This means the few instances that WERE crimes now won't be, and both householders and invaders will be encouraged to use more violence, making things dangerous for everyone.

If the policy were to use other methods than immediate custody of the victim/suspect in these situations then the ""reasonable force"" policy would be acceptable to everyone: as there are so few actual prosecutions then there would be no harm being done to victims by heavy handed immediate custody, and accordingly no public outrage.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; Ah, I see, thanks. But I would've thought that we'd have had more than 1km cubed of these asteroids having hit earth in the last few billion years.

That's right. And in that time scale the Earths surface has largely replaced itself many times. So much of this material would be underground, or under the sea bed, or simply in solution in seawater. Never the less, some of our current mines are even at old asteroid impact sites, such as [this one](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/18/is-the-diamond-market-about-to-collapse-over-huge-russian-find/) in Siberia, although I think the asteroid was non-metallic. 

&gt; That would imply that a large percentage of surface precious metal deposits are from asteroids.

No, it wouldn't. In addition to the above, remember that smaller asteroids simply burn up in the Earths atmosphere - shooting stars, meaning the metals are dispersed very thinly over a wide area. Or if they hit over water - simply in solution. 

&gt; Is that thought to be the case, or is the 1 km figure hyperbole?

In what sense? In terms of mineral value? No. No one is arguing with the Planetary Resources guys over asteroid composition. They're arguing over mission practicality, and economics. 

In the extreme long run, even the 1 km asteroids are small potatoes. The [big guys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche), hundreds of kilometres across, contain more metals than our entire civilisation could use for many tens of thousands of years. 16-Psyche contains roughly 1.7×10 to the 19 kg of nickel–iron.

true,drwormtmbg,flair5,,"Seems like they move him around a bit.  I think they want to use him as a long term Xabi Alonso replacement (or at least compete with Sahin for it).  But, this season I've seen him deployed in all three central mid positions for them.  

Alongside Xabi, which means they both need to make a shade more tackles than they like, but as long as they aren't up against a robust midfield it doesn't seem to matter much.  They did this more, when Khedira was hurt.

Instead of Xabi, which I think we can all agree is where he excels.  Especially if he's playing with a good wall winning CM, like Khedira, Sandro, Essien, or Scotty P.  He really gets to fire quick passes to the wings, and feed Mesut.  (Oh, how I wish they would make bug eyed man love babies).

Or, as in this last game, as a CAM.  In front of Alonso and Khedira.  I thought when I saw the lineup that it was a plan to keep more possession.  But, in retrospect I think Mou chose to do it, and give up possession.  Modric will naturally sit deeper than Kaka or Ozil.  But, it gives the defense and Khedira another potentially dangerous quick out.  How many times have we all seen Sandro win possesion, pass to Modders, pass to Bale, cross to Crouch, goal.  

[Yesterday's goal](http://footyroom.com/manchester-city-1-1-real-madrid-2012-11/) came as a result of a dumb shot from di Maria, bounced back to Arbeloa, pass to Modders, quick wing di Maria, cross, Benzema easy finish.

Changing the law to allow disproportionate force is incredibly dangerous for obvious reasons. It is also unnecessary: the low number of prosecutions suggest the actual law is working as intended. Also, would it really change the arrest? The police are still dealing with a murder they have to investigate, why would they interview the suspect differently just because they have a slightly stronger defense?

Changing police policy on the other hand has NONE of the risks of changing the law, and completely ends both the trauma of the victim, and the public outrage, meaning there is no ongoing clamouring for a ""castle law"" or somesuch from the tabloids.

What should be born in mind is that, in the event of most murders, where the perpetrator is identified, a prosecution is almost always certain, even if not for murder.

In the event of this type of crime, a prosecution is incredibly unlikely.

They are very different circumstances in terms of management, risk and wellbeing of suspects, and likelihood of prosecution, and the police need to act accordingly.",0,1353603809,null,0,1353604043,0,c758h21,t3_13lzif,t1_c758h21,t1_c758cp1,null,1430473313,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If these points were brought up in your OPost I would have had more questions regarding integration, so bravo. 

I think Islam isn't compatible with equality, but is not completely incompatible with equality either. Example: City in Ontario Canada was rocked when a quadruple ""honour killing"" was unravelled and nobody knew what the hell to do until it went to court. This was a big discussion among some of my friends who were studying Political Science MA's in Toronto. They found them guilty, obviously, and the judge quoted ""that these were crimes stemming from a twisted concept of honour."" -- Does this send the right kind of message about Islamic faith integrating into Western cultural norms? There are much better minds in the Political Science department and religious theory than I, so hopefully one of them read it and educate me. Seriously, please. 

I agree, you shouldn't tolerate the intolerant. But they should be given every opportunity as someone in regards to their rights and freedoms in their country, as a citizen of the planet (see: UN declaration of human rights). Do Christians get to build a church if they buy some land and can pay for it? Yes. Then so should Muslims. I see where you are coming from, but just because the Christians/Catholics/Anglicans/Jewish/spaceinvaders were there first doesn't necessarily mean that everyone else is excluded. 

Some of their fundamentals, or beliefs, or values, or whatever clearly do not align with the UK's (and a lot of the Western world's) cultural norms^1 (traditional or otherwise). That said, I don't think *all* Muslim people go to *that* extent with their belief system. Evolution of though maybe, progression of society's influence. For all I know the UK could be a *good influence* ^2 on the Islamic faith. If that is so, then I hope that both play the teeter-totter game and find that balance. 

^1 *I'm actually not too educated on Islamic cultural norms, just the bare bones from general conversations with Muslims who I work with.
^2 I'm not claiming to know what is good and bad influence for the Islamic faith. Nor am I claiming that there should be influence, but I find it hard to argue that integration would not influence someone or something. 

I agree that religion shouldn't have dominance over the UK; I don't live in the UK anymore so I can't really comment on that basket. 

It seems silly religion has its hands in so many things. The problem there is obvious, and it has to do with rights and freedoms, and those things will always motivate people to think and act in a certain direction. -- How do we ensure not just Islamic, but Christian, Jewish and all other religions don't cut into people's lives? Kind of hard, honestly. Gays in a heavily christian area may have a hard time living in that area, being with their partner in that area, and practicing religion in that area. Religion affects even the people who are not in it, which supports your points. 

I understand your small minority and growing example. Toronto has this, and it is well established. I live on the border of GreekTown on the East end and some street signs are in Greek and English in this specific area. Sometimes, the English ones are missing. I don't know Greek. Influence on a non-speaking Greek city? Yes. Harmful? No. Do the greek sway our politics in the area? Of course. Do they clash with other ethnic neighbourhoods? Possibly, but I hate my white neighbour and his *insert a type of political ideology here* views. I'm a white neighbour with *insert a type of political ideology here* views. Parallel communities exist in Toronto, albeit they do blend together in some respect. But you clearly know when you're in a certain ethnic area. Everyone (to an extent) understands what their duties, rights, and responsibilities area as a member of Canadian society and as a citizen of Canada. 

Your problem to me seems to be the issue of religious ideologies melting with well established western cultural norms. Not parallel communities attempting to live on the border of each other. That is a different rock, and I'm glad you've brought it up. 


So among other things:
Ok yes, ""you have a right to move away"" was a bad attack. IOU one upvote the next time you say something silly in public. Even if you are pissed up, naked, and doing the worm. Your original argument sounded more like an attack on Muslims choosing to live in the UK and wanting to exercise their own beliefs (to some extent, obviously), but I think I interpreted it a little off.

Moderate Islam is quite different to our understanding of 'Moderate' Christianity.  In England a moderate/mainstream CoE person probably doesn't have a lot of religion in their lives.

true,p7r,null,null,"Right, so first things first, you're rarely going to go wrong with anything made by the BBC judging by your tastes. 

After that look for Channel 4, and then ITV (the latter has a variable commitment to quality drama, but they made Secret Diary of a Call Girl, and cynically I'd argue they did so mostly because they knew a naked Billie Pipe would get ratings). You can safely avoid anything made by any other UK channel (""five"", Sky, etc.), until you've exhausted those networks.

Also, like UK theatre, there's a pretty wide and varied mix. You seem to have honed in on predominantly Sci-Fi, fantasy and historical, but there's a lot more out there I think you'd like.

Comedy:

* Morecambe &amp; Wise Christmas shows - understand these, and you'll ""get"" British mainstream humour that isn't quite so Python-esque
* Blackadder (you can skip the first series, it only gets going from S2 onwards when they moved it to a studio format)
* Red Dwarf
* Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister
* The Thick Of It (only if you know something about Blair/Campbell)
* Fawlty Towers
* Anything with David Mitchell in it (Mitchell and Webb Look, etc.)
* Outnumbered
* The IT Crowd
* Father Ted
* Black Books

Drama Series:

* Downton Abbey
* Spooks
* Rome
* Being Human
* Shameless (strong Mancunian accents, try a few episodes before buying any box sets, etc.)
* Cracker
* Prime Suspect
* Anything made by Stephen Poliakoff (Shooting the Past is the best thing he ever did IMHO)
* Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - the TV series with Alec Guinness as Smiley knocks the film into a cocked hat.
* The Hour
* Talking Heads - a very experimental format, but widely considered some of the best writing to ever make it to TV
* House of Cards
* The Prisoner - now looks very dated, but still brilliant. Truly.

Films (for those Sunday afternoons where you want a 120-minute fix):

* The Ipcress File
* Gandhi
* The King's Speech
* All the Harry Potter films (apparently - I'm one of the few people alive in this fair isle to never have seen them, but they come highly recommended)
* In The Loop - but only if you liked The Thick Of It (it's a film version)
* Chariots of Fire
* The Italian Job (the original one)
* Anything made by Hitchcock
* If...
* Brief Encounter
* Trainspotting
* Pretty much every British film that got a nomination at the Oscars, ever... :-)

If you get through that lot, there are plenty of lists of great British films, dramas and comedies, but you'll have a sense of what most Brits consider to be the very best stuff to have come out of the UK in the last 20 years (and beyond in the case of the films), from getting into the above I reckon.

There's a wide variety of writing styles in that lot. You'll find yourself really being pulled to some over others, and you'll want to explore the writers/directors behind them. In the UK, unlike the US style of the ""writing room"", most comedies and dramas are produced by just one or two writers. It's why the series are much shorter, and why they have such a distinct and unique flavour (unlike US sitcoms which are the same format and characters re-worked with minor differences). 

This means that once you find a writer you like, you'll find it easier to discover other series they worked on, and you can dive into a back catalogue that could keep you entertained for a long, long time.

For example, if you love The Thick Of It, you'll want to explore other stuff Armando Ianucci did (including the Alan Partridge stuff, which might draw you towards Steve Coogan's other work, or take you off to Brass Eye which in turn might drag you into Chris Morris' other work, etc.).
 
If you really love Gandhi, you're going to be able to dive *deep* into a lot of other work in a similar vein. 

Love Blackadder? Well, you're going to be drawn to almost everything Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Richard Curtis, Ben Elton and others did in comedy series format.

British TV is good at that - there was even a series called Comedy Connections that showed how all of our comedy is interconnected by key talents behind the scenes, a bit like the Kevin Bacon game. You might want to find that online somewhere.

Hope all that helps! Good luck - I'm jealous of you being able to go out and discover so much good stuff for the first time, you're in for a great journey of discovery. Lucky, lucky sod... :-)

This is the best idea I've heard in a while. 

What the Guardian writers don't seem to understand is; you can't fix dysfunctional families just by tossing more money at them in benefits and council houses. It might make them marginally more comfortable, but its going to do nothing to break the depressive circles they find themselves in.

Inactivity quickly turns into lethargy; you sit on your arse for a few months and you loose a lot of motivation and self-esteem and end up with depression issues (I'm speaking from experience). It's not an easy thing then to change yourself, all the time while being judged by those around you for being 'lazy'.

Now I don't know anything about epilepsy, but maybe with some lifestyle help this guy could have learned to manage his illness better.

If we play amazing football then I can see him being offered a permanent role but they will still interview other candidates. If it's scrappy like last season then he will still get an interview/discussion but if Pep wants the job they will give it to him. 

As he's interim I think at the end of season the board will sit down draw up a shortlist of managers and meet/interview all of them then make a decision afterwards. Rafa doing badly or doing well will affect his chances accordingly, however I don't think they'd give him the job outright as they're able to look at their options which is the usual way to go about running a business in my mind.

So had all 4 changed in Feb, Front 2 got warning on MOT at beginning of month as down to 3mm tread, rear ones still going strong with 6mm tread.

So get them done, also got to do brakes ,MOT says fine but on 40K service before tires were done it was advised to change the Discs/pads, Sadly no-one can tell me how much it will be without taking the tires off first.... so lots of OT done last month, hope tires last to Feb for its 60K service and get them all done at once 


This time to Renault garage though! took it to my normal trusted garage, after 40K service engine kept cutting out, took it back and to dealers a few times, unable to clear due to CLIP code, so was told it was safe to drive, on M6 to Carlisle damn thing started doing crawl mode over 50mph, got it into Renault at Benfield Carlisle (top people, waited for me to arrive even though they were supposed to close at 12:30) and they checked it over on the Monday, Mechanic baffled as well until I mentioned the 40K service, took fuel filter to pieces, the crappy filter was wrong size, so the £11 part the garage installed cost me £107 to fix plus two days lost wages as stranded in Carlisle....

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Are you kidding me? Every stadium and team has it's own way of representing a symbol. Ours is the flag. You know the flags you might have seen being waved at every start/mid/end of the match? The flags that are hung inside Stamford Bridge, the flags which are raised before every match? The liquidator, pride of London ring a bell?

Every single team has their own way of representing their symbol. If ours is a flag then why does it bother people so much? It is no different than Barcelona, Real, Bayern forming their logos with the plastic cut outs given to every seat. Heck that is even more pathetic if you count this as pathetic because those are strips of plastic for every fan, these are genuine flags each representable on it's own, not some red piece of plastic paper.

I have been at the Bridge for most of the matches that the flags were handed out and let me tell you it was the best atmosphere and one of the proudest moment for me as a fan. Seeing a sea of flags waving and the crowd singing at the top of their voice under the flood lights at Stamford Bridge is a spectacular scene. That is the reason these try hard trolls (including you) try so hard to hate it, because it looks damn good unlike their cut outs (most clubs don't even bother for the cut outs which is causing this butt hurt behavior). 

So the hurr hurr plastic flags joke only makes you seem like an absolute joke. If the flags are plastic than Barcelona, Madrid, Bayern and every single top club in the world who do something like this are even more plastic compared to Chelsea. Just because you read this as a joke on a Twitter account, read it on /r/soccer or joined a facebook page called ""Teh Chel$ea hav plastic flags !! :b"" doesn't mean the point you are making has more value to it. If you still believe this then there are 50 other top clubs before Chelsea that pull off much worse than Chelsea so your point again becomes irrelevant. Also our flags were not even plastic, in addition here is a comparison with other teams that do the same, I guess we really are doing a much worse job :

true,bad-at-Reddit,null,null,"Honestly lads I think this one manager thing is way too cliché. Hear me out here..

Would you rather have Wenger for long term and the results as Arsenal or a 'crisis' at Chelsea with all the success that comes with it. Look at Arsenal, their top players leave over and over again like kidnappers are taking away kids with a truck load of candy. These players are the base of the club, a manger only directs them. A club can function with a new manager but replacing these players is much more difficult. Look at Chelsea and think about the last player we lost like Arsenal. The closest thing is Robben, the rest were nearly all made redundant. 

I think this one manager crap is just plain b.s. Sure if you have Fergie then it makes sense but what if you end up with someone like AVB? What is the guarantee that after the 15 years you will give him he will not take you lower than hell itself? Isn't it better to try 15 managers instead? That is what you do with players. They become shit and you change them, why not the same with the manager?. This way your fans will see so many different playing styles at the club and there will always be something happening. I honestly wouldn't trade our technique with the stability of United because I find it plain and boring where the manager is your lord and savior and you are supposed to worship him regardless. Yes SAF deserves most of that but that will not be the case 90% of the other times. EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the club should be equally accountable and stability for long term is not good if have to sacrifice so many years to achieve it. Lets say AVB fucks us up for 5-6 years then finally pops his cherry and wins the Premiership and F.A cup. Will it be worth it? There is no guarantee he will win the next year or the year after that, then he will become the same as the rest of the short term hires with others catching up. I would rather see Carlo, RDM, Guus manager the club 1-2 seasons at a time than go through that. Arsenal fans etcetera all try to laugh it off like they are doing so much better but they would castrate themselves to get the same success by going down the same road. 

That is why I do not for a moment buy this long term crap. Unless we find a man who can show enough promise to deserve 18 years at this club he is not getting them, we have too good of a team right now to let him fuck up for 5-6 years just to get a system started while all this talent rots on the benches. If we had a 6th place side then sure but we have a title winning side (bar the striker problems etc). So unless you are Jose Mourinho you are not getting 18 years at the club unless you show something to back up your demand. If not then Chelsea will still squeeze out all you have to offer to the club and replace you like they would replace any other player which even though is a controversial and harsh approach, it still works. 

All those teams talking about stability and laughing at us, talk to us when you can build up a staircase with your trophies high enough to talk to us face to face.

Other option is to get cable from Virgin Media. First you need to check they supply to wherever you'll be living. They'll give you proper internet like its supposed to be. They do student contracts of 9 months sometimes but you'll struggle to get less.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"I know it might annoy some of you but in my opinion /r/Soccer is one of the/if not worst Football communities I have come across both online and offline in terms of football knowledge. They have the numbers but it really is playing in all the wrong ways. I have been watching football all my life, played it from the time I could walk and never went two months without missing Chelsea at the Bridge. I have also been a mod of some major Chelsea communities online before this sub existed dating as far back as the shitty design haunted forums you come across every once in a while but never have I seen a place more pleb infested than that Subreddit. 

They just lack basic football knowledge and do not know what has been happening even in the last 10-20 years. Every single day I see fans with crests criticizing other clubs for something their club has done over and over again in the past. I cannot even fathom if they are being hypocrites or if it just plain sarcasm, unfortunately it is the former. Someone posts about basic football rules and they google and copy paste the wrong UEFA/FIFA rules and take them completely out of context, things you are supposed to know just off the top of your head by watching football like why a player was not red carded if the keeper tackled him but he scored. They start getting into such idiotic arguments over a rule that is imposed for a reason and when you prove them wrong their last contribution is that it is just a plain wrong rule and should be changed because it does not satisfy their newly found perspective. Then there is all the crest down voting/upvoting, circle jerking, irrelevant posts about beating on a dead horse etcetera. The front page contains 90% gifs and videos with the quality of goal less important than the popularity of the player and team. I don't even want to get into the really deep details that just make me plainly cringe.

This is why I have stopped taking the bait and getting into arguments. Though when someone posts similar things here I just cannot resist. There is not way I'm letting this place go down the same road. Let me just put it this way, it is extremely easy for any decent football fan for a couple of years to look like a football fanatic on that Sub. That is the level they are at.

true,listyraesder,null,null,"Sorry, but **Gavin and Stacey** started on BBC Three, then moved to BBC Two, and finally to BBC One. 

**Torchwood** originated on Three, then Two and finally to One in co-production with Starz in the US.

**Little Britain** transferred from Radio 4 to BBC Three, then got a bit repetitive and moved to BBC One for its 3rd year. It spawned ~~Satan~~ a highly successful international stage show and a HBO follow-up series.

**Being Human** has found critical acclaim, as has **The Mighty Boosh**, which started on BBC Radio London, then R4, BBC7, BBC Three and a slightly edited version on BBC Two and was later sold to Adult Swim in the US.

**Snuff Box** and **Monkey Dust** (later shown on BBC Two) pushed BBC's comedy to the edges of good taste, and was all the better for it, MD in particular seemed to be atonement for passing on Brass Eye, while **Mongrels** tried something a bit different - an adult-themed comedy with puppets.

As we can infer, BBC Three is a rather effective incubator for programmes and talent entering BBC Vision, especially when transferring across from BBC Radio and when trying something a little out of the BBC's comfort zone. Once an audience is built or the concept is finessed, it can move on to larger audiences on the senior channels, in the same way BBC Four has done.

There's nothing dishonest or misleading about that statement. It would only be confusing that the cost ^((negative outcome)^) of a decision could be a cost ^((an amount of money)^) to a non-native english speaker.

&gt;Implying that money not taxed by the government is a 'cost'. What's the 'cost' to the Government of that journalist taking home his salary?

They aren't implying that all untaxed money is a cost to the government; they're (correctly) calling them out on how much it costs us by not taxing them the correct amount and allowing them to evade tax.

Most of it has to do with the voting system as it allows users to dictate the content. It's almost like a forum where everyone has moderator privileges. If ever there's more people on one side of an argument than on another, the effect is hugely exacerbated by the fact that it takes so very little to downvote something into censorship. They can downvote anonymously without even having to comment, so a lot of users just take to mass-downvoting out of spite. As a result, usually only one side of the narrative is heard.

It takes a mere -5 score for a comment to go below the threshold and be censored, and if a new thread gets just a few downvotes off the bat, it'll probably never see the front page.

I don't really consider the welfare of the food I eat if I'm being honest, and I have a feeling a lot of people who criticise halal don't really give much of a shit either...

1. It's great to see Reina back, even though I man-love Brad Jones too.

2. We need Lucas to give us a bit more composure at the back.

3. Sahin needs the ball more - we almost seem reluctant to give it to him, but when he gets it he makes it work for him and his class is evident.

4. Sahin has lovely hair, even when it's not gelled.

5. Henderson sometimes seems more concerned by his hair than the game.  It is nice though.

6. Wisdom must have been struggling from the get go because he looked like he'd just got out of bed before going off.

7. Assaidi looks great running at people but lacks compsure to make the right decisions at the moment - Suarez evidently annoyed at not receiving a pass at one point.

8. I get a fuzzy feeling when we introduce Suarez. A bit like how the Americans must feel when they decide it's time for the F-22 Raptor to come out of its hangar.  He also provided a focal point which we'd lacked until then.

Both of the major outages affected O2 and giffgaff - since it was the same piece of core network equipment. Giffgaff has had porting issues of its own, data outages (not O2's - and I know this as I was temporarily with GG at the time), payment issues, etc. 

&gt; The 3G coverage where I live is very good, I don't really give a fuck if it's not so great in the back ends of dorset or whatever. Some providers prioritise coverage by area and others prioritise by population.

If you think it's good enough then good for you. I am speaking generally, across the country. O2 are probably the lowest (they just announced 90% 3G coverage, a figure that 3 hit in 2007- I suspect Vodafone are higher, and 3 and EE are at 98% with plans to move to 99% soon). 

It's not the ""back ends of Dorset"", it's just about anywhere that isn't extra-urban. This is based on my experiences of O2 in the South West, plus in the Berkshire area.

Even if you take all [the money we pay](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-interactive-money) into the EU you get 31 million a day and if you include the money we get back from the EU its 13 million.

In fact HMRC estimates that tax avoidance costs us [10.2 billion pounds](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20423195). If these schemes and avoidance measures were shut down they would be getting an extra 28 million a day which would pay for the EU nearly 6 time over. The whole money argument is flawed.

Allen has seemed a bit slow lately, but I think the reason for this is because he has played too many games in a row. 

As of now I do not see Gerrard working well in this system, but that may be because he is told not to play too far in the attacking play. Maybe it will work out if and when Lucas is played CDM, Allen CM and Gerrard can focus more on the CAM-role, but that solely relies on him taking the shot.

true,cobrophy,null,null,"Hey,

I watched the first 20 minutes or so of the video. Here are some thoughts/notes:

- Introduce the players at the start of the game. Even if it's just a pub, you should treat the players with respect try and elevate them in the eyes of the viewers. It's also a good habit to get into should you cast pro team games. Also use the player names through the game, if only for variety  so you don't have to keep saying pudge, or bounty hunter etc.

- It's obviously hard when you're talking constantly for up to an hour, but try to avoid meaningless statements like ""no apparent comments on that"". Also adjectives are your friend. There's a huge difference between ""There's a hook from pudge on the slark"" and ""there's a _beautiful_ hook from pudge on the slark"". Even if it's not particularly beautiful, it injects excitement and broadens the vocabulary of the cast from just items, abilities and heroes.

- Work on your camera control, this should get better with practice. Occasionally you clicked on the minimap and jumped to a shot of the woods, particularly when you're rushed as in the first blood. Also if you're not sure read the text across the top or if you miss that, hit enter and read the text on the chat log. You're always going to miss kills but just managing how you react is important. Also make sure your mouse sensitivity and pan speed are both at the lowest possible setting when you cast (but not when you play). This will make scrolling feel much smoother. Also make use of the middle mouse button to scroll and drag the screen if you're not already.

- You spent _way_ to much time focusing on items and item builds. While this is an easy thing to resort to it's a bit dull when it's just rotating through everyone talking about their items. Also if you're not sure avoid trying to predict item builds, and opening the shop to see when an item can build into. Mention big items or unusual choices. Instead try and give a better context of the flow of the game and the bigger picture. Which lanes are winning, which are losing, who's getting lots of CS (while some casters might be criticised for overemphasising this stat, you didn't mention it once in those 20 mins), who's getting kills, who's getting targeted by the other team for ganks, which carries are going to get scary late game. 

- On a related note use the QWERTY stats, the Gold and XP graphs.

- Think about who the audience is for your cast and tailor what you're saying appropriately. If it's for new players learning the game (like say Purge) then explaining why they warded the pull camp makes sense. If it's for seasoned viewers into the pro scene (like Tobi) then that information seems a bit redundant.

I hope that's helpful, and doesn't come across as overly critical. Overall, I enjoyed your cast. I think you've got a really nice style, cadence, intonation, and inflection (and a nice Scottish accent) in how you speak. There's room for a bit more hype and excitement. This might seem a bit weird and odd when you're alone in your room or whatever. But it's a bit like being on stage where you need to exaggerate your actions, speech and gestures for the audience. 

The best thing you can do is practice relentlessly. You wouldn't go into any new job and expect to be great in your first day, week, or month (perhaps even year for some jobs). Yet sometimes people have this idea about casting that they will just be able to do it cause its basically just speaking and i can do that. The people who I've seen get a lot better (people like Sheever who has improved loads, or Purge) spend a lot of time casting. Also watch your own casts and get used to listening to yourself speak (even if it's a bit hard at first). I'm sure you would have picked up many of my points, and more, yourself.

OK, not sure how this turned into such a monster post. Keep it up and best of luck.",0,1353662573,null,0,false,0,c75jvr8,t3_13muz3,t1_c75jvr8,t3_13muz3,null,1430478841,5,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,5

The only thing that stopped there being women bishops is the house of laity.  These people are 'elected' by the congregation (if I understand the system correctly - although I don't know if elected should be 'appointed').  So really the vote against women bishops isn't by the church (as we tend to understand the term) but by the congregation.

Those therefore decrying the Lords (and particularly the Bishops place in it) as being un-democratic are also the ones decrying the decision of 'democratic' process (even if two thirds of the vote isn't democratic).

As an aside - I think that if you are going to have a House of Lords you need a representation of all sorts of different types of people in it and having (in theory) politically neutral religious leaders isn't necessarily a bad thing.

true,LeoKhenir,lfc92,,"Yeah, Carra seems to work better with Coates for some reason. Here's my thoughts of why:

Coates is quite unexperienced. Thus, he doesn't take many risks while playing, always being defensive-minded, and lies quite deep. This means he quite often be second defender/covering defender when Carra closes down opponents. 

Agger and Skrtel on the other hand, have much more experience and are also more attack-minded. They both are quite keen to start an attack from behind, often taking the ball with them upfield and into the opposing half (and both have enough experience to know that one of them will hang back if the other one runs). This means Carra gets left behind, no-one to cover him, since we often also attack with fullbacks. We have seen Wisdom lying quite deep, most likely because of inexperience, much the same as with Coates, not enough confidence, but it seems Rodgers has told him to push up more, he was quite deep in opposing half with crosses at times yesterday. 

Back on track:

When Carra is paired with Coates, the latter's inexperience and defensive-minded attitude makes him a natural covering defender for Carra's closing down. Agger or Skrtel will however push up the field, leaving Carragher as the covering defender, something he no longer possesses the agility and speed to do.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"The adoption issue was over whether organisations are allowed to engage in commercial and public services while engaging in unlawful discrimination.

That's illegal, and it has nothing to do with faiths. When organisations of any sort act as services they are not allowed to discriminate for certain categories. Whether its because they are facists, or racists, or mysoginists. One is perfectly free to act according to ones faith in ones own organisation, but if you chose to occupy the capacity for certain public services that are legally mandated to be available to everyone you have to follow the regulations governing that practice.

No one was demanding the rc church changed their dotrinal position. Merely that they could not operate a public service in violation of the rules everyone else has to follow.

The point is that the church both wishes to remain established, and, more importantly use its rights as an established church constantly. It uses its votes and position in the lords, and it places great importance in its public role. It could voluntarily elect not to use these rights, and both impose itself on the public and make demands of the public will and the public purse. It could acknowledge how little it represents the public and that there was no legitimacy whatsoever in it wielding 4% of the votes in the upper chamber, and more in real terms given that the bishops attend more intently on certain votes.

It does not do so. Therefore the public has a considerable stake, and a compelling interest.

""Atletico Madrid are yet to make a move for Napoli striker Edinson Cavani, according to the player's agent.

There has been claims Atletico are sizing up the Uruguayan as a replacement for their sought-after striker Radamel Falcao.

Falcao has been at the centre of much transfer speculation with European champions Chelsea reportedly keen to bring the prolific frontman to Stamford Bridge.

That has prompted speculation that Atleti have already begun their search for a replacement, with Napoli striker Cavani apparently high on their wish-list.

But Cavani's agent, Pierpaolo Triulzi, has denied any contact has yet been received from the Spanish high-flyers.

""If Atletico Madrid want to pay his **62m euros** release fee then they can have their say, but there has been no contact and we don't know if they want to buy him,"" he told Marca.

""We don't know what will happen in the future, but the player is very happy where he finds himself right now.

""There have been a lot of offers for him in the past, but Napoli didn't want to let him go and got him to sign a contract extension instead.""

to say that arsenal is more prestigious and successful than liverpool right now is a bit disingenuous. arsenal does have cl over liverpool, but are also on a 7-8 trophy drought, while losing their top players season after season stating that the club ""lacks ambition"". losing players like nasri, clichy, fabregas, song, and van persie in consecutive seasons does not go unnoticed by the rest of the footballing world, and while i'd agree that arsenal are a bit better off than liverpool right now, the separation isn't as much as you would like to believe.

Most of it relates to DEFRA and DTI regulations. If we want to continue trading with the EU after independence, I suspect that we will need to retain most of it anyway to be compliant with EU trade policy.

As for the original link, I agree that it overstates the ""old Empire"" line. However, the Eurosceptic argument depends on the UK being able to be independently successful in the current global market place, and that has been unrealistic since the 1960s IMHO and is increasingly so. We would need a huge expansion of manufacturing and agriculture which would take decades to create and which all the time would need to compete with cheaper competition worldwide.

true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;How when there is no public outrage for non-established churches discriminating, but widespread media and political response for an established one, be that the difference is not established.

Because there are more differences between them than mere establishment.  The fact that this is a difference between the two does not meant that this is the particular difference that is causing annoyance.  Claiming otherwise is a fallacy.

&gt;The only difference between the different churches is establishment.

Obviously, this is false.  Putting aside the range of theological differences, there is a significant cultural one.  The C of E is part of this country's identity, in a small, irritating way.  Catholicism isn't quite *british* in the way anglicanism is.  It's why many think a church is a ""proper"" place for a wedding.  Why people otherwise inexplicably still think baptising their children is the ""proper thing to do"".  Why carols by candelight feels traditional.  It's part of our history.  

Establishment is a symptom of that big factor.

&gt;The article ignores this obvious causal factor

You asserting it as causal does not make it causal.  The only actual reason you've supplied is that it is the only distinguishing factor between the anglicans and the catholics.

&gt;instead proposes alll sorts of nonsense vague emotive reasons for which it provides no evididence

Emotive doesn't mean false.  The people of britain have a diminishing, but present cultural/emotional attachment to the church of england, in a way they do not with other denominations or churches.  This was originally caused by the establishment of the church, but would not disappear if the church was disestablished, because it is a separate effect.

If you are living with someone as a couple look at tax credits. If you're already claiming tax credits notify them of the change of circumstances - the lower income should trigger a rise.

In answer to your question, there are two types of benefits - and these types are NOT made clear. ""Contributions based"", which is what they put you on if you have made enough NI contributions, and ""Income Based"" - which is where they assess you on the money you have (from *any* source - partner, savings, anything).

Income based is a lot more intrusive (they can invite themselves into your home to check you're not living with a partner, etc) but you get extra 'perks' such as free prescriptions.

Since you don't qualify for Contributions Based support, you should ask them to assess you for Income Based support. AFAIK they are paid at the same rate.

Untrue. If you want to define it such strict terms, the EU as it stands today, **didn't exist before the Lisbon Treaty**. It only got legal personality with the Lisbon Treaty. So you are absolutely wrong here.

&gt;Before that we had the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) which turned into the European Economic Community (EEC).

Actually... The ECSC never turned into the EEC, they were different communities built in a similar way that were then united under the term ""European Community"" or ""European Communities"" or EC. Notice the ""Communities"", that's because the EC didn't have legal standing, it was merely a way of getting all these individual European Communities under one roof (those still include the ECSC, the EEC, Euratom etc.)

In 1993 with Maastricht, the EU was created, but did not have legal personality. That means the ""pillar system"", where the old European Communities were defined as the ""pillars"" of the new EU, was intact until 2009 and Lisbon. So in fact, the old communities were intact as part of the EC (which was the first pillar of the EU), until Lisbon. The ECSC expired in 2002, and its duties were absorbed by the rest of the first EU pillar.

We might see an emphasis on tracking back from our front 3. Hazard Oscar and even Mata aren't bad defenders, they are just a little bit lazy at getting back. When we transition to defence those guys need to put in more effort to stop damage from happening. That also applies to Ramires and Mikel when they roam forwards (as has been happening frequently).

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Of course, as someone familiar with London it's our biggest challenge to find a new site for a stadium. If Earl's Court doesn't work out and Battersea seemingly out of contention, we're left with Old Oak Common in Harlesden. This is the last chance Chelsea will have to move to a site that keeps everyone happy and I think it's a symptom of demographics here that it has received such little attention so far, this is literally Chelsea as a club looking to become financially competitive and stay that way for the next 50 years. By taking control of C&amp;C there'd also be a named and designated site for the CPO and the SayNo clowns to consider, you'd see the 75% majority easily in any such vote as it's too good to turn down

I might have to do some digging this weekend and see if I can speak to someone who knows anyone involved in this deal. I have some acquaintances at Deutsche so it's not out of the realms of possibility. So much more potential here than any sharing situation with the Malaysians, if Roman purchasing the club is the single most important event in Chelsea history, this may well be in second place

Edit: The 75% is crucial in easily moving Chelsea as an entity from Stamford Bridge to Earls Court, but it also allows Roman the financial flexibility to plan for future income from Stamford Bridge redevelopment when measuring the costs of any new build at EC. I'd be hoping they go the full hog and build a 60,000 seater stadium that is cutting edge in technology, infrastructure and facilities. Considering what they were willing to spend on Battersea, you can now add in the savings of not having to restore and maintain a decrepit building and the savings from not having to majorly contribute to a Northern Line extension as was a provision in any Battersea negotiation, plus the offer for Battersea was made with no Stamford Bridge contingency income (£4-500m). All told, should Roman secure C&amp;C and with the pieces that would fall in to place thereafter, he'd be approaching the new stadium build with around £6-700m more than he briefed the architects who did the Battersea impressions. Not suggesting he'd spend even half that amount in addition to what he planned for Battersea, but it's certainly a much stronger position to be in.

1. Why assume a new stadium will be soulless? Sure, Arsenal fucked their new stadium up, but that doesn't mean we will.

2. I find it extremely unlikely that the FA (or whoever would be in charge of arranging our temp stadium) would give us permission to use Wembley as home.  It's a monumental, neutral ground meant to host large national and international spectacles, allowing a team to play their normal season there would reduce the spectacle of getting to play at that stadium.

3. You ask the difference between 55000 at SB v 60000 in a new stadium.  EnglishMD already brought up an excellent point regarding emergency egress.  
Also, we're struggling to find ways to increase the bridge's capacity by a few thousand.  If we were to expand the bridge it would be the absolute last time that was possible.  The stadium would essentially permanently capped at 55000.

Ahem. Can't really add anything that hasn't already been said. Definitely take the time to spouse up your CV - have a nice generic one that you can adapt / tailor to fit future job opportunities. Register with some employment / recruitment sites whilst you're at it, and upload your CV.

If the worst comes to the worst on Wednesday, ask them why they're letting you go. I doubt they're under any obligation, but if you're finishing at that point, you might as well push them for an honest answer.

If you can put your hands on proof that you've been exceeding any minimum targets you were set, do so, as if they try to go down that route, it'll at least make you feel better knowing they're full of crap.

2. This one I'm a bit torn on because you're definitely right in that Wembley sits empty most of the time and so could easily be scheduled to hold a team's games.  On the other hand I can see the FA wanting to keep the sense of awe the stadium imposes, which could be lost a bit if games are\ being held there every week or so.
3.  The issue of emergency egress doesn't have to do with the grounds the stadium is on.  It has to do with the size of hallways, doors, stairwells.  These sizes also depend on how many levels there are in the building.  As stands/seats are added the existing dimensions may no longer be adequate for the increased human traffic flow.  I'm not arguing that this is a major concern, just one that would definitely need to be considered and is not immediately obvious to many people.

And currently a 55000 seat stadium would be perfect for Chelsea and in theory SB can be made to fit this.  But what about Chelsea in 10 years? If the club continues to expand what happens when we need a stadium that holds 75000? we'll be right back where we are now.  The other option is to build a new stadium that holds our current need of 55000 but could also be easily expanded to meet the club's future needs.

Is that just conjecture? From what I understand of the situation we made an enquiry and were Sahin's preferred choice (he passed a medical at Arsenal) but then Liverpool came in with a larger offer. We could easily have matched your offer if we wanted to, but decided that he wasn't worth the expense for what would ultimately be a bit-part player in our squad.

He would be down the pecking order at Arsenal, certainly behind Arteta, Diaby, Wilshere, Cazorla, and Rosicky, so we had no incentive to pay him a huge sum to sit on the bench every week. 

I should re-iterate now that we have just signed a £30M a year deal with Emirates which will come into play in 2014/2015 that gives us an extra £24.5M to spend on wages. Combine that with a new estimated £25M per annum deal with Adidas that is is going to be announced shortly and we could blow Liverpool out of the water on wages if we wanted.

I've read that Amy was the first weapon the Silence used against the Doctor. When this failed (I'm not sure how or when), they simply came up with the idea of using River Song. 

Again, though, this is just a fan theory. 

&gt;it could be accomplished with new footage of a Silent and some clever CGI.

Certainly possible, although the inability to get Karen Gillan in for one more scene would likely hamper such plans. Whatever role Amy played for the Silence, it was still vital enough that attempting create new scenes in the context of past events *could* easily be done with clever CGI or simply having a Silent in the background, but may end up simply being unnecessarily time consuming.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Well, I'm at a crossroads here. If the takeover (and/or loan signings) didn't happen, it would be an absolute pasting courtesy of Crystal Palace. And yet, I'm feeling this strange surge of optimism - as though Leeds could possibly get something from the match. In Thomas we finally have the top drawer winger we've been crying out for, which gives us a fighting chance, while Tate slotting into central defence should make us more balanced at the back. The problem is, Palace have pace to burn - and that's one aspect our defence is sorely lacking. Tate won't particularly help that - he's slow but has good strength and positioning, just like Pearce.

So, my head says no but my heart says yes. The only way to settle this is, surely, to go with a draw and no doubt get the result completely wrong. But, my surprise correct prediction against Millwall has allowed me to afford that luxury!

**1-1** - I can see Leeds nicking a goal at the death, allowing all the fans to leave with a warm, fuzzy feeling that will only get fuzzier with more drink.

Here's the line-up I think Warnock will go with:

---------------Kenny

Peltier---Lees---Tate---Drury

Byram---Brown---Tonge---Thomas

---------------Diouf

---------------Becchio

Subs: Ashdown, Pugh, Green, Norris, White, Hall, Poleon.

There are parts of the team, like three of the defenders, the wingers and the forwards that I'm absolutely certain about. However, question marks are over the likes of Drury - who **should** play, considering there's been no midweek game, but Warnock seems reluctant to give him a run in the team - and the central midfielders. I have a feeling that he'll drop Green, who was lacklustre against Millwall, but keep Tonge, who was even worse against Millwall. The question mark is whether he'll be really positive and go for Norris, or make the midfield more combative by opting for Brown. I suspect he'll choose the latter.

Here's hoping for a great game to commemorate the takeover, anyway!",0,1353713573,null,0,false,0,c75sik9,t3_13o608,t1_c75sik9,t3_13o608,null,1430482995,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

At NYRB he would try to take on 3 defenders at a time and fail each time. Also would go down way to easily. Like he would just lose his footing. When he was paired with Henry his timing was off. Henry would serve him perfect balls but wouldn't be there for them. There was a lot of hype about him when he played for the USMNT.

And let's get another thing straight, it's not like roman is sitting on a throne dishing out these decisions, as much as the deluded fools over on r/soccer would like you to believe. There is a board, chairman, chief executive, and a slew of back room staff that are involved in these decisions. 

The club showed its loyalty to RDM by giving him the managerial position after last season. Am I happy he was let go?  Of course not. He's always been a fan favorite as a player. But the truth is, long term, RDM isn't the best option to take this club forward, from top to bottom. He's a victim of circumstance in that he was only supposed to be the interim manager, but because he won the CL we HAD to give him the job. 

As much as I may feel a sense of loss, I would NEVER reconsider supporting the club. It's not like we're moving to another part of the country.
