Personally, I'll have mixed feelings about it. Yeah, skipping to the front of the line using the power of money would be lovely, but Spurs have gotten to where they are being relatively self-sustaining and financially sound, and that's something I'm extremely proud that they're able to do. If the club gets bought out by a Kuwaiti family, as you said, I'd follow the team regardless and celebrate every victory as I have before. I'm a fan of the club, not the owners, but that doesn't mean I still won't criticize the effect that massive amounts of investment has on the transfer market and other teams who are trying to work their way up by more conventional means. But everything I've seen has 200m as a figure and investment rather than buyout, and combined with the fact that Levy's been itching to get a new stadium going, I don't think much of that will go into transfers (wage budget, maybe, if the Bale deal is any indication).

The point is, the new stuff doesn't overwrite the old stuff, and it doesn't need to either, because there's always a way to reconcile it.

You should have a day up to the north coast to see the [Giant's Causeway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant's_Causeway) (we apologise for the small amount of creationism that is currently shoehorned in, we're trying to sort that), [Carrick-a-Rede](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrick-a-Rede) rope bridge and the [Bushmills distillery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmills_Distillery). 

Spend a day looking at some of the beautiful buildings we have, including [St Anne's Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anne%27s_Cathedral,_Belfast), [Queen's University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_University_Belfast), [Grand Opera House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Opera_House,_Belfast) and the aforementioned Merchant Hotel.

The [Ulster Museum](http://www.nmni.com/um) is excellent and free entry.

There are many [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/local-to-you/northern-ireland/) attractions around Northern Ireland if you don't mind getting out of the city a bit. 

Again, if you don't mind getting a bit away, the [Marble Arch Caves](http://www.marblearchcavesgeopark.com/) are a world class example of limestone caves and worth seeing.

Northern Ireland is pretty tiny, so there's nothing that's really more than a couple of hours drive from Belfast. In fact, you could even get to Dublin for a day which is also a beautiful city.

It all depends on what you are interested in. Belfast has a vibrant night life with plenty of bars if you just want a bit of ""the craic"". I'm not much of a bar dweller, but I'm sure some others could give you advice about this.

On one hand it's amazing to see the outpouring of love this guy is getting, but on the other it's almost tragic that they are so used to seeing their best players leave that they just sort of accept it and move on. 

I feel almost bittersweet about it and I don't even care about Ajax. I imagine it's very emotional for Jan. I just hope he works out here, settles in, gets along with the squad and coach, and most of all I hope our fans support the hell out of him.

In regards to the alternate Doctor Who media my theory is: it's canon until the TV show contradicts it. In which case, it's up to us to come up with a reason to explain it rationally. Somehow.

The only problem with throwing away canon is that a certain degree of it allows us to keep a continuity in the Whoniverse.

I just think in my head, ""Somewhere, somewhen, it was explained.""

If someone asks me a more explicit contradiction like the Doctor having a family in new Who, being half human in '96, and having looms in classic novel range, then I'll work on a theory. (and I do have one for that).

Anywho, I'm going to keep operating on those assumptions, the only difference being, I'm lending no credence or sense of authority to the word canon. I mean obviously things like fanfic aren't canon (or continuity), or stories that are explicitly stated as alternate continuity (Auld Mortality), but I just don't even want to deal with this word.

true,Phoolf,null,null,"Actually no, I didn't want to go to a redbrick. After spending so many years supporting myself (I only finished my A Levels at the age of 19) and so living with more older and more mature people the idea of going to a university with people who were going through something I had done 3 years ago would have been a step back for me. Sometimes I feel like it would have been much easier to study full time and live the uni lifestyle but actually I was over all that (partying, drinking etc) by the time I turned 18 so most likely I would have hated it. 

I think the whole education system needs to be shaken up. If its not of benefit financially go to university then really it shouldnt be a degree, so many people in the past decade went to uni because it was the done thing to do, they took our loans and when they finished they had no interest in their degree area. I cant think of any of my friends who have started to pay back even a fraction of their loans, and none are in the area they studied for 4 years. That's a massive waste if you ask me. I dont think it should be a requirement for everyone to have a degree, I dont think everyone is suited to it and I think its been a factor in why so many people cant get job anymore. The labour government (despite being a labour voter myself) have a lot to answer for, their whole equality and leaving no child behind was a bit short sighted if you ask me, there's nothing wrong with doing a trade or working, academia should be for people with a passion for it. I dont agree with the tuition hike, but equally I think if you choose to do a degree which has no future in it or you end up hating then you shouldnt have chosen it in the first place.

As for being able to afford the OU at the new rate no, but I would be happy to take out loans because I plan on using my degree for my life long career at the end, so I would be able to pay back the loan. If it was something I wasnt too fussed about then I wouldnt bother, but then why should I be using up money with no intention of paying it back?

As to your last lot of questions no. It's a shame we suffer with mental health problems but I think it enriches me as a person, its made me much more compassionate and as for working so hard I think that makes me stronger too so while life may be shitty at times and it is a struggle Im glad, it makes me what I am and I love what I am.  :) I'd in no way say I was exceptional, I often think Im pretty shitty and useless, and I know not a lot of people could do the same in my situation so Im not setting myself up as a poster girl for having a hard life and overcoming it, many are much worse off than me, and I think people should have a chance, but Im not sure this is entirely the right way to do it.

The church only supported science with a view to understand 'gods world', and was a remnant of the roman catholic interest in science. The church was also one of the biggest publishers of work, so in order to have papers published scientists needed to produce work that fitted in with the religious understanding of the world. When that focus shifted, and observations were explained purely by science, the church shifted it stance and began to condemn the research as work of the devil. 

On the other hand, the Islamic religion has had a massively positive effect on scientist, which some of the best scholars coming from the Islamic background and some of the most fundamental discoveries coming from Muslim scientists.

true,Education_throwaway,null,null,"Hi, as this has just become a hijacked thread can I just ask people to consider the article and make up their own mind, some valid points are made in the comments but I should stress that you should be sceptical of some of the statements. I would feel better is some of my own figures and assertions had been challenged. 

A few points though, the increase in university fees have resulted in a drop in university applications (8%)but course that are NHS funded (the fees are paid for by the NHS, for now) are heavy oversubscribed with applications going up by 25% every year . I consider this a firm indication that taking on a debt is a barrier to higher education. 

Many professional roles require that the person attend a university I would not want to be treated by a Doctor that did a distance learning course, Access is a way for poor people to get into good universities that are dominated by people for the middle classes. 

It is also cost effective, £3 700 is a lot of money but not is it means you get a person off housing and council tax benefit for the rest of their lives and into a role where they can pay tax, The work programme pays companies up to £13 000 a person and puts them in roles that are short hours and low pay meaning they still need benefits just to live and are below the tax threshold. Also Access works, the vast majority (75%-94%) go onto university from courses across the country but the work programme cannot even hit 36% into work. 

We have a rising level of inequality in this country and that is wrong, I want everyone to have a chance at a decent life and the ability to contribute to our society.  

So please consider if this is worth a few minutes of your day to email your MP, local paper or the nationals and just raise awareness, as I do not higher education in the UK dominated by the middle classes any more that it is.

And if you do consider it a case of “they should have worked harder at school” then please go and look into this issue as you will find it is not that simple.

The people you should be scared of are the ones that think they do know best they end up favouring noisy extroverts.

A great deal of being a senior Academic scientist is the organisation of junior staff in ways that you don't get in businesses. It involves traveling conferences and reading fuck loads of material, reviewing/editing journals, reviewing journals, writing references, winning grants and progress your department in the right direction and that takes a spark that less than 5% of people with PhDs are even *capable* of possessing and less than 1% are actually good at it. This doesn't even mention attempting to teach undergrads, something like 20% of whom don't care about science they just took a BSc because mummy and daddy told them it would get them a job, in the mean time they're going to get fucked off their faces for 3 years.

The PhD students and post docs operate with a lot of freedom but someone like Brian Cox will be there directing their moves along the way. From this perspective I'd imagine a senior scientist would be pretty good at running a ministry; they're also less likely to blame civil servants for their own incompetence.

As for the reversing thing, its just something you get used to. Its a skill yes, but then some people can programme computers, some people can build a house, some people can fly a plane and on and on.  As for the BMW driver, I enjoy pissing him off so I'll just go a bit slower when he starts honking his horn. Just have to keep an eye out for people like that though in case they do do something silly. Eventually making the lorry go where you want becomes pretty automatic so you can concentrate on everything else that is happening.

The little day glow things are called pointers or indicators. Because a lorry generates a lot more torque and rattles around a lot the wheel nuts have a habit of coming undone much sooner than they would on a car. The pointers are set to point at one another. If after a journey they are no longer pointing at each other its a good indication that the wheel nut has started coming loose.

So I think I'd appreciate one or two recommendations, then maybe advise around which subscription(s) to purchase.

Were they all made at the same time, or is there a listening order? For example, if I start off at the begining of the monthly range will I end up listening to the forth and eighth doctor ranges within the monthly range?

Why would hand picking a recommendation make a subsciption more difficult? It seems that with subscriptions, you can pick what ever stories you'd like.

Leeds is also decent, and takes about 30min on the train.

Bradford is a Ghetto. They can make it look nice in the city center (I note, its always areas that can be seen from the town hall windows) - but the rest of Bradford isnt so nice. Some areas are so run down and poor they look like slums, and I guess that makes them slums, in 2012.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Trust me it's going to get really expensive. If you buy all the DW dramas it'll cost you way over 1000 USD. Maybe even 2000. There are at least 300 Doctor Who radio dramas in total. Not to mention the bonus stuff.

Now about the order. The monthly/main range is a mish-mash of Doctors 5-8. Story number one could be a 6th Doctor story and the one after that could be a 8th Doctor story. But then the story after *that* could be a 6th Doctor story again. In this case, the two 6th Doctor stories would be connected. That's how all of the Doctors ""runs"" are managed in the monthly range. Now, since the stories aren't very arc heavy you don't have to skip around the monthly range and listen to all the 5th Doctor stuff first then all the 6th Doctor stuff, etc. etc. You could if you wanted to. It's only the 8th Doctor whose range is the most arc heavy.

Now the 8th Doctor Adventures (separate from the main range) are another side series. This series ran for a few years when McGann didn't do any stories in the main range itself. It has a different companion and different arc. You don't need to hop between the 8th Dr Adventures and the 8th Doctor stories that are in the monthly range.

The 4th Doctor isn't in the monthly range- he has his own side series like 8. They are separate.

Why would hand picking recommendations make subscription difficult? Because you can choose where you want your subscription to *start*. You pick the starting point for 6 or 12 *consecutive* stories. That's the rub. You can't pick and choose a random 6 or 12 out of the entire range. Which means that if you buy story number 12 in the main range, you don't want to start a 12-story subscription at number 1. Because you'll end up buying a subscription for stories number 1-12. You'd basically be re-buying story number 12.

It's a nightmare, I know. Had I known this, I wouldn't have cherry picked so many stories. I would've saved myself over 100 USD. Because, if you use the subscription system you get bonus stories and bonus special features material.

So, when you buy subscriptions, you want to do it in 12s (6s work too but less bonus material and no free story). So your subscriptions would go like 1-12, 13-24, 25-36, etc... That's the most cost-efficient method.

I'm telling you right now. You're lucky you're just now getting into Big Finish because they recently revamped their website- which used to be a train wreck and travesty of a website. But the way they run their sales and money is still just as confusing. Now... recommendations:

-------------------

Scherzo (8th) is a story in which the Doctor and Charley end up in a new universe. They don't know if sight even exists or water... It's amazing. Traumatizing, scary. It's an excellent dialogue that utilizes the radio medium to its fullest and explores the romantic Doctor-companion relationship. One of the best done as well. The Natural History of Fear is also good but in the middle of 8's Divergent arc. edit: Actually Scherzo is also in that arc but nothing very confusing/spoilery.

Jubilee (6th) is what Dalek was based off of. Jubilee is different. It somehow manages to shed a new perspective on the Daleks and really shows them in a pure light. (not necessarily a positive one) Totally stomps on Dalek. Can't be blamed- you get 2 hrs for this story instead of 45 min. The way the Daleks are portrayed is different in Jubilee and more sophisticated- less of this 'suddenly got emotions'.

Omega (5th), Master (7th) and Davros (6th). Part of a special villain trilogy which goes in depth for each of the three major villains. For a fan of any of these three, it's a total geek fest of awesomeness. If you don't care for them, you'll start to. They're just plain excellent. I never cared for Omega but now he's such a 3 dimensional character.

Flip-Flop (7) and Holy Terror (6) are also a couple of very good stories. Flip Flop is timey wimey and 6's is..well I can't spoil it.

The Fires of Vulcan (7) I found particularly good. It's a pure historical (no aliens or anything!) and set in Pompeii (I know, you're thinking 'oh not again') but trust me, it's great.

And the I, Davros special series which is an origin story outlining Davros's life from a child up to Genesis. One of the most culturally layered stories and brilliant with great tie ins and references. This series is what gave me confidence in Big Finish. I didn't realize how spoiled I was. It can be a little tough to get all the characters in your head at first (there are many) but it's wonderful.

And Spare Parts (http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/r36yg/i_learned_some_neat_stuff_about_cybermen_origins/ minor spoilers) which is kind of like I, Davros in that you see the society the Cybermen came from before they were Cybermen. Also interesting tie-ins here and I love that they used the original sing-song Cybermen voice from The Tenth Planet. My favorite.

Doctor Who and the Pirates is also a very good 6th Doctor story. It sounds bad and comes off weird in the first half, but it is worth it. The Klein/7th Doctor trilogy is phenomenal- when Klein, a Nazi, is the Doctor's unwilling companion and lots of crazy ensues (http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/uf447/klein_trilogy_discussionpromotion/). Or the Jamie/6th Doctor trilogy, same deal. Or the Dalek Empire quadrilogy- Genocide Machine, Apocalypse Element, Mutant Phase and then Time of the Daleks.

And Loups-Garoux with 5 is really good. And *Auld Mortality* and *Full Fathom Five* are two amazing alternate continuity stories part of the Unbound Doctor Who mini-series  (http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/ppyqu/i_just_discovered_the_unbound_what_if_series_for/). I never stop raving about *Auld Mortality*- all those links I've given you are me raving about dramas. But Auld Mortality has this guy, Geoffrey Bayldon playing the first Doctor and he's spot on! This drama is also written by Marc Platt- the writer of Lungbarrow so I get lots of cool nostalgia feels too.

And Full Fathom Five is: What if the Doctor believed the ends justified the means? Amazing and played by David Collings- a great actor who played the Voc guy in *Robots of Death* with the 4th Doctor. The ending leaves you shivering.

You should probably use this Wiki list to help guide you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_audio_plays_by_Big_Finish

Which means there are pretty fan servicey stories out there- but the good news is, they're very good fan servicey stories.

Benhayman probably said it less confusingly than I did about re-buying stories and the order the monthly dramas are arranged in. The Companion Chronicles are a weird thing that you should ponder on a bit. They're a bit different from normal drama stories. Like partial narration and partial voice acting.

The dramas are like a middle ground between new Who and classic. More modern style pacing and quality of plots with a classic Who episode format and more abstract heavy-sci-fi concepts like classic Who. Very good stuff.

Now I know that 1-2 is really tedious. You won't miss anything crucial. You'll just miss a lot of cool stuff. And if you jump forward you'll spoil yourself with the good stories and production values. If you chug through 1 and then 2's run, your standards will adjust to those of the 60s. And then the show will get slowly better and better the farther along you get until you're in the clear with color tv in 1970 with the 3rd Doctor.

Here's my advice:  Don't bother.

Wait a few years, or you have no choice to spunk many thousands just on insurance.  Never mind the cost of the car, fuel, tax and repair.

When I was 17 I was angry I had to pony up £800 a year for a bog standard Fiat Uno.  Seeing the cost you lot have to pay nowadays, I just wouldn't bother.  I'd wait until after university age, because other wise the amount you pay for your insurance from 17 - 21+ could have bought you a second hand monster of a car.

Or you could put all that money into savings / something useful.  Rather than spunking it away on a motor.

Get a 50cc / 125cc bike.

From that I have learnt to not be a knobhead driver after seeing them damage their cars (recently one of them mounted a kerb at 30mph and blew a hole in this tyre). I just wish there was a way to determine the idiots from the rest, I plan to drive carefully and not speed around, not just for safety etc but I can't afford to ruin my car and all the extra fuel. 

I got this car at an auction for about £1100 and it is valued at around £2000 and seen the exact same car in a lot worse condition being sold for around that. I recently MOT'd and serviced it, had a good valet and worked out all the scratches on it. I obviously don't want to throw all that away now, but seems the only road ahead for me...

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;money can't buy you happiness

Of course it can.  It most certainly staves off the misery that more often than not accompanies comparative poverty.  That's the sort of thing mothers tell their children and which poor people repeat to themselves as though temporary happiness is some sort of compensation.

The idea that the wealthiest not paying enough tax is the cause for a £150bn annual deficit is ludicrous.  It's so ignorant the statement itself stands alone.  If the wealthiest paid a £150bn a year there wouldn't be any wealthy, or industry either.  Seriously, the idea that it's because of the wealthy not paying enough tax for why Labour overspent year on year from 2001 onwards without having much to show for it is childishly naive.  Besides you don't know what austerity means for the rich; record low interest rates so their savings aren't paying off, their pension pots are collapsing, capital gains tax has been increased by 50%.  There's a new bank levy and GAAR is being pushed through for the next financial year.  The idea that the only people suffering are the poor and middle class is frustratingly uninformed.  

And all this sensationalism from a man that was going to lose his job anyway over primary care trusts, that themselves have only been around 10 years and were roundly acknowledged by all the main political parties as being a clusterfuck since conception.  Lib Dems ran on a platform for the General Election of replacing PCTs, so did the Conservatives, and when Labour first introduced them it was only a couple of years until they were announcing plans to halve their numbers.",0,1341674437,null,0,1341681690,0,c5ao9wx,t3_w4ynn,t1_c5ao9wx,t1_c5anbxf,null,1429318231,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Effectively we are in a situation where roads are crowded, cars are designed to crumple and tend to cost more to repair, councils are better at charging the insurance companies for damage caused by accidents and legal/medical costs are increasing.

Everyone has been hit by massive price rises in insurance and the insurance companies with their vast statistical experience believe you'll be expensive and likely to claim. The cost of your car has very little to do with your insurance price (until you get very expensive or powerful cars) because in a £500 shed on wheels you can still prang a 40K car.

Put your pitchforks away people, it isnt as bad as it sounds.

&gt;During an interactive audio exhibition, the **historical** figures of the rector of Clonfeacle Reverend Doctor William Richardson and geologist James Hutton debate the formation of the Causeway.

&gt;""I am a keen naturalist, so I have every sympathy for open-minded scientific enquiry. But as I say, I am deeply concerned that Mr. Hutton may mislead you with his theories on the age of the Earth,"" the rector is heard to say.

&gt;""We know from the Bible that the Earth is 6,000 years old - one has merely to count the generations between Adam and the birth of Our Lord.

&gt;""And for all his eminence as a geologist, and his standing with the Royal Society in Edinburgh, that makes Mr. Hutton's theory nonsense!""

&gt;Mr Hutton responds: ""Now, now, Dr. Richardson - I am well aware that my theory is challenging, upsetting to many. I myself find it dizzying.

&gt;""Yet when I look at the evidence, at the slow and steady volcanic formation of rocks - occurring even as we speak - I am driven to believe that 6,000 years is a mere blink in the life of the Earth.

&gt;""I see no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end!""

""All of the information presented to visitors in relation to how the Giant’s Causeway was formed, and how old it is, clearly reflects mainstream scientific understanding that the Causeway stones were formed 60 million years ago. ""

That said in my mind (and from what i have seen of others) Brad is aging and we need to find a potential replacement.  I think we can get one more season out of Brad which would allow us to make a move for someone like Butland.  But i have also seen Patricio, Vorm, Krul, Viviano, Mihaylov, Handanovic and obviously Lloris.

I would love to get Lloris, as i am sure you would as well but i think it is possible for us to pick up a younger goalie to bring along for part of the season behind Friedel without much issue if it comes to that.

Friedell isn't great playing out of the back, but he does organize the defense and make the plays he needs to. At this point in his career its unlikely to think he will suddenly be come brilliant and develop into Pepe Reina in terms of playing the ball out from the back, but i think he could be more than serviceable and get us through one more season.

I would like Lloris, i would prefer we don't spend a fuckload to get him as we have other needs.  If we can't get Lloris, i would like to see us get a younger goalie who can push Brad and develop into what AVB needs in his system.

The Roman Empire rose as a brutal, expansionist, pagan, military power it persisted for 1000 years in the west 2000 in the East. Slavery, including sexual slavery was taken for granted, for much of that time slaves fought to the death for people's amusement. In each case when the empire finally fell in both the West and the East Christianity had become the official religion.

As such I'd like to hear the Bishop expand upon this point and explain how come this god of his let the Roman Empire (which so far as I can tell always seemed pretty damn immoral) expand and prosper for so long. At what point did Roman morality incur the wrath of the Bishop's sky pixie and why did he confusingly allow them to rise as pagan powers then kill them off when they embraced Christianity?

If I go to the Olympics I want to see sport. 
If I watch the Olympics on TV I want to see sport. 
If I am taking part in the Olympics, I expect sport all around me. 

At *no point* am I looking to see political or religious commentary. It has no place in a sporting event. 

To give you some further food for thought: The Westboro Baptist Church are well know for picketing military funeral services and are widely regarded as a [hate group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church). By your rational, they should be allowed to picket the Olympic arena / chant / sing / wave banners that entirely disrupt the enjoyment of others at the event. That is - after all - their right due to free speech. 

But (and I don't think I'm alone here) I would sooner ban them from the event for any one of the above reasons than worry about their right to free speech. They've spoiled events in the past and they would spoil this one if they attended and were vocal. By your rational - that would have to be allowed due to the Human Rights act etc. etc. 

But before you start harping on about ""but where does it end?!"", please put down your tinfoil hat and consider that the Olympics are a huge celebration of sporting ability, intended as a competition between countries in good faith. They should *not* be anyone's personal political or religious soap box. Who are you (or they) to decide that their views are more important than the enjoyment *and purpose* of the event overall? 

For the same reason I would not want an extremist group spoiling the funeral of a loved one - I would not want an extremist group spoiling a public event that is not by or for them. The reasoning behind this is the same reasoning that means a teaching will tell a disobedient kid to shut up when they stand up and start singing during a school event. 

It's not the time or place. 

So please, hop off the high horse and consider what the Olympics is really all about. It is not about your views on religion or politics, both should be left at the door.

I think someone 18 who lives at home with a full time job could afford to run a car, but it would consume a fair bit of income. What needs to be more affordable is for a way of having a group of young people be able to own and insure a car between them and spread the costs that way. In the same way it is unlikely an 18 year old could afford to live alone and as a result flat shares are common amongst that age/income range.

true,captain_ramshackle,uk,Kingston Upon Thames,"A cheaper car will make almost no difference as what really puts the cost of insurance up is the value of everything else you can hit. It's the reason why fully comp insurance for my £1000 car is only £10 a year more than 3rd party fire &amp; theft. The insurance company believes that the cost of replacing my car is negligible when compared to the total cost of an accident.

Think about this reasonably basic scenario.

£800 Fiat Uno pulls out of a t-junction without clearing checking for oncoming traffic and is hit by a car worth approximately £15K, the fiat is knocked across the road hitting a parked car worth £9K before bouncing into a lamppost.

There are two occupants of the Uno who are injured, the driver and passenger of the other car also receive minor injuries.

So we now have

* 15K written off
* 3K of damages to the parked car
* 15 days of hire car charges resulting in 1K charges
* 7K for the emergency repairs to the lamppost

So before the passengers of the Uno sue the driver for negligence and the other cars passengers do likewise 26K worth of damage has been incurred. The cost of the uno is negligible.

I'd also point out that as the Uno's insurance policy would be paying out it make perfect sense for the passengers to sue the driver if they have a legitimate case.

O MY GOD SHUT UP YOU FUCKING COCK

I'm not even going to get in to the whole attention is a precious resource thing here. At least at first. 

I think this all boils down to jealously. I almost NEVER see it stated, but I've pushed it in irc, PMs, aim etc in the old days with assholes. 

This is all about how you think it's ""not fair"" that she's getting upvoted just for being a girl. As in, she can take any excuse to upload a picture of her doing basically anything and get upvoted. The problem is...

* people like you hate it, and there are a LOT of people like you on every site. This type of thing is always the top/first/most replied to comment if not super close. Are you upvoting it so other people will see how much you disapprove? What? I don't believe the ""white knight"" ratio outdoes your group because you're always, perpetually at the top. 

* do you realize how pathetic you sound. Seriously. You sound like a little kid annoyed that their sister got attention for something they didn't. *get over it*. This is the absolute Most immature thing I regularly see go down on the Internet. Seriously. *what the fuck*. You think you're so clever making some snarky remark about it. 

* similarly, you're alienating women who like the nerdy, dorky things you like. This is why women who like these things mostly only talk about it with their close friends irl. Every fucking site you go on unless it's a well moderated message board for that one thing is usually shit, and *even then* it sometimes is. I thought you liked women? I thought you wanted lady friends(or more) who liked the nerdy things you liked? Think about your actions. 

* again, similarly. You are contributing to this little corner of this site, and the rest of the internet at large, being shit. By perpetuating this attitude and these sentiments you are seriously driving away both women, and people who aren't absolute sacks of crap, or in the process of being filled up to be those sacks. There will never be no girls on the Internet, but if you keep it up there will only be the ""I'm not like other girls, I'm one of the guys!"" type women here who just chant the battle cries along with you. Do you really want that? Pretty sure you guys stated you didn't like women like that, and special snowflakes are irritating. If this isn't an all inclusive community it will slowly become like 95% asshole guys and nothing else.

* are women not allowed to like nerdy things too? I sure see a hell of a lot of them at PAX and anime conventions with intricate handmade costumes, but moreso *playing the games*. Including tabletop, serious fighters, etc. the ""dude"" stuff. Most of the women i know who like stuff like dr who or star trek have seen the entire Collections of series'. Sure a lot of effort to go through for attention. 

* suppose what you and your friends state is true. That pathetic basement nerds upvote this for the ""wrong reasons"". That people really do upvote women just for being women and contribute to them *just dojng things for attention*. Who cares? Supposing attention ""whores"" are real, the best thing to do would be ignore them and downvote them thereby depriving them of attention. Right? You cant delete everyone else's comments and votes, and you're not singing a battle hymn that will start a ""hey, she's a big fat phoney!"" realization and downvote wave. Someone says this in every thread and it never changes shit. If you alls policy was just to downvote and move on the threads would die.

And do you really want the threads to die? Just suppose for a minute they're only saying ""hey, look! I like what you guys like too. Isn't this thing cool?"" *completely sincerely*. Is driving off a few outliers who continue that sentence in their heads supposedly with ""upvote me and validate my existence!"" worth driving off the women who genuinely like the things you like and would be cool to talk to? I don't think so. 

Every woman I know who is really nerdy, which is most of them, hates this shit. They avoid posting online on places like this because of it. They think a lot of people on sites like this are shitheads because of people *like you*. And every time I see something like this I start to believe them more. It doesn't matter whether they'd make a post like this or not, or what they think about it. It's your response that drives them away.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;The church only supported science with a view to understand 'gods world', and was a remnant of the roman catholic interest in science.

That is not really true at all. There was next to no censorship of scientific discoveries; 99.99% of discoveries were completely compatable with scripture and passed without remark. The only cases I know of where what could be called censorship occured were Galileo's discovery of a non-heliocentric solarsystem and Darwin's theory of the Origin of Species (and even then it was only loudly dismissed and laughed at - not suppressed).

&gt;We can debate this all day if you like, but pound for pound the catholic/protestant religions have had more of a negative effect on science than a positive.

Pound for pound you're dead wrong. I'm not a fan of either church and I'm quite happy to go on a rant bashing them for all of their flaws, but I give credit where credit is due: they did more good for science than negative. There are a few high profile cases where they were negative, but their impact was small in the long run and certainly tiny when compared to all of the positive effects.

true,NotMud,null,null,"Putting your mother down as the main driver is insurance fraud and will cost far more in the long run if/when you get found out. You won't actually be covered so you're just pissing your cash away.

In addition to that huge risk, it sounds like you're missing out on a no-claims bonus of your own at the same time. That means that you won't benefit from cheaper insurance a few years down the line.

If you're going to fork out for insurance, you might as well do it properly. That means not putting your mum down as the main driver, and making sure you get your own no claims. Otherwise it's a waste of everybody's time and money - mostly yours.

Insurance is expensive when you're seventeen. That's partly because insurance companies know they have you by the short and curlies, and partly because young drivers are more keen on driving like twats. If you can't afford it then don't buy a car - is it worth burning a fiver a day just on insurance? 

As beard-maketh-the-man says, put the money into savings/something useful. It's important to remember that you'll also be spending many hundreds of pounds on fuel every year, plus repair costs when it goes wrong and all sorts which will easily come to £1k a year on top of that. Now take that £1k a year, the £1,500+ on insurance, and the price of the car. That's £4,000 you could be putting into savings in the first year. 

There are a few things you can do to keep insurance prices down:

**Don't use insurance comparison websites** because they are **shite**. They are especially useless for young people. Try specialist companies like Adrian Flux - they saved me many hundreds when I was your age.

**Take your Pass Plus.** It counts for a lot and it teaches you more in a day than you'll learn in a week's worth of lessons, including important stuff about motorways.

**Take out a limited-hours policy.** Rather than monitoring your driving, this just means you can't drive your car between the hours of 11pm and 5am. This can make a huge dent in your premium while still allowing you to get to school and back (or whatever).

**Get a low-insurance car.** If your car's engine is bigger than 1.2l, you're going to have issues. There are other factors at play but this is the ballpark figure for when things get pricey for young drivers.

**Add your mother as a named driver.** It'll usually take a few quid off at least, and it might come in handy anyway.",0,1341693158,null,0,false,0,c5as5p3,t3_w6clv,t1_c5as5p3,t3_w6clv,null,1429320060,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Only downside is you have to wait up to 5 business days for Chelsea TV to process your membership and get your access codes to watch the online content. So if you're thinking about getting it before the pre-season tour of the United States that starts in 11 days, consider acting about a week before July 18th just to make sure you have access.

All in all, considering I spend around £100 at the Megastore each year and want to watch all the Reserve and U18 fixtures, I think it'll pay for itself this season. That's not to mention trying to book a flight to London and snag a ticket to see a Champions League match this Fall for my birthday.

I like to think that The Doctor's 10th incarnation became sort of mentally ill near the end, dealing with so much stress and anxiety. He pushed himself to believe that if he regenerated, that he would die for good. This is why he's so excited right after he regenerates. The regeneration gave him a bit of a 'reboot' that helped put his brain back into place, and wipe out all the anxiety, stress, and depression that had accumulated in his mind in his 10th incarnation.

Well, enough of my rant, go forth and enjoy season 5! I won't ruin anything, but I will say it's by far my favorite of the reboot series.

Student life has much to offer depending what you like and where you go. If you are an arty person you might hang out in bedminster, if you like loads of clubs its center for you.

Bristol is a beautiful city, and you'll love it there. I've been here for two years now and I love the place. The university itself is fantastic, quality teaching and great facilities for the most part. It depends on what you're studying (I'm studying Chemistry with fairly new labs etc..) but I think they're mostly good. Although, I personally find the Students Union a bit lacking.

As far as residences are concerned, it depends on what you're looking for. Self Catered vs Catered, and how close you wish to be.

I chose Hiatt Baker in stoke Bishop (no-one chooses that usually) because the rooms were a good size with a basin and it was catered and in stoke bishop.

Anyway, here's a breakdown:

Stoke Bishop has many advantages, most of the first year students are there so its easy to meet a lot of new people. It's close to the downs and sort of has its own student campus like area. Major disadvantages: 45 minute walk to university or a bus that gets stuck in traffic. Buy a bike.

Clifton Halls vary a lot, they are a lot closer to the university but you are likely to only meet people from your hall or from your subject. Which isn't the end of the world. Generally have stepped up security measures.

Catered vs Self-Catered is a fairly self explanatory debate. Self-Catered will likely be cheaper but you might end up eating unhealthily or worse, you might get some really untidy flatmates! (Seriously, some people are just allergic to washing up apparently).

Shared Bathroom vs En-Suite. This really is a matter of preference. En-Suite is obviously your own bathroom but they're usually pretty small and are more what I would call washrooms. Shared bathrooms tend to have more powerful showers and tbh, I rarely had to wait at Hiatt Baker.

Now, I'll be more specific:

Hiatt Baker: Catered in Stoke Bishop. Huge Hall, you won't meet everyone there. Fantastic Bar. Free Pool, Snooker and table football etc. Good mix of People. Large Rooms, with basins (very useful). Good Security.

University Hall: Also called poverty hall. Small rooms and flats. Some upgrade en-suite available. Nice bar, great atmosphere. Generally some really down to earth people here.

Badock: Apparently everyone wants to be here. Its alright I guess.

Churchill: Fairly posh. Large rooms, decent bar.

Wills: Are you posh? If yes, go here. I know its a stereotype but it does seem to fit. But seriously, lovely hall.

Goldney: Really nice place, good kitchen, decent sized rooms and nice atmosphere generally.

Clifton Hill House: Only been here once, got lost on the way out, can't remember much of it.


All in all the most important thing to remember is that you will end up loving wherever you pick and it will be the time of a lifetime.

Apart from that [this thread](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=81178) probably has some useful information on halls.

Older players always have higher wages than younger players. Yes he'll be 30 before next season's end so he's not a long-term solution, but could he improve the team over the next 2 seasons of challenging for a CL place? I'd say yes. FSG don't exclusively sign youngsters, else Bellamy wouldn't have been brought in.

As for where to play him - cutting in from one flank, which Rodgers quite likes. Alternatively, his attacking movement is intelligent enough to be a backup as the main striker and bring others into play while scoring goals himself.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Canon is a standard people use in a franchise to describe what ""actually happens"" in a story. Fanfiction, alternate continuities, etc. aren't canon. In Star Wars canon is defined in tiers of G-Canon, T-Canon, where G-Canon is the movies and T-Canon is something ""lesser"" like the books. And if facts between those two contradict, G-Canon wins and that's the ""official"" fact.

Star Trek has it so that the tv series and the movies are canon.

Doctor Who has never had a canon officially ruled by any showrunner or the BBC. But the BBC treats the actual tv show like canon (and excludes expanded universe stuff like comics from ""official"" guides) so you can kind of infer that it's a sort of canon.

In the Doctor Who franchise fans fight like wild dogs over canon. People always have their own versions and opinions on it because nobody bothered to establish how it works in the Whoniverse (since Doctor Who started before the term meant what it does now).

Personally I think canon is a pain in the butt and a waste of time. Who cares if the books aren't canon? They're just as ""real"" to me.

I chose the U.K. for a Master's program for multiple reasons. It's a one year program which would put me on pace to graduate only a couple of months after someone from my class who did a two-year Master's at another university (I took a gap year to figure out precisely what I'm writing here).  Another reason was that it's an English-speaking country.  I realize they have cheaper English-taught programs in non-English countries, but I figured it would take some of that strain of the initial adjustment out of it.  Also, I've been lucky to have been to 13 different countries, but the U.K. is not one of them.  Last, no GRE score.

As far as choosing Bristol, it's a major city, a leading green city (good for someone in a Water and Environmental Management program), and a bicycle friendly city (which I typically associate with being friendly to younger people).  It's also extremely close to Bath, and a bus trip away from a variety of other places I would love to see.  The University of Bristol was the only school I ended up applying to.

Justifying the cost is kind of a bigger beast.  Living expenses and tuition for the year, I'm looking at 40,000ish USD (25,000ish GBP), putting me in the neighborhood of 50-60 thousand USD in debt when it's all said and done.  Still scares the shit out of me when I write that down.  As a 23 year old, I've never had to deal with numbers that big that have non-hypothetical dollar signs attached to them.  That said, the time to take chances, financially speaking, should be done when you're young.  If this is a mistake, I have the rest of my life to fix shit.

Please don't put your mum as the main driver if she isn't. That's called fronting and it's illegal and voids your policy, which can turn out to be *very* expensive. Adding her as a *second* driver might bring your premiums down though, especially if she's got a good no claims history.

Other than that, insurance for young drivers is so expensive because, on average, they have more accidents than older drivers. There's not a lot you can do about that. That's why I'm only just thinking of learning to drive at 24, though I appreciate that I live much closer to local amenities than you.

You may also find that a car of a different make and model is cheaper to insure, so consider selling your current car and buying something else.

There's only a few reasons ever given for disliking andy Murray:

* Media hype. Everybody else likes him or goes on about him, but I'm above the fray. Not so above the fray that I'lll just STFU of course - I still must let everybody else know how superior I am for not caring for Andy Murray. 

* Grumpiness. Andy Murray doesn't behave like a stand up comedian. His sense of humour in interviews is too dry for me or goes over my head. He's far too genuine - I want someone who is pretends to be Mr Happy and never scowls when he loses a point or a match.

* Scottishness. Often tied in with the last point. He once made a joke about ""anyone but England"" after tim Henman humourously goaded him about Scotland. I'll forget all context and hate him forever because he isn't a Tim Henman clone.

* He's a loser. Andy Murray isn't the absolute best number one tennis player in the world. He's usually only third or fourth best in the world - therefore he's a mediocre choking loser because I only support the best there is.

&gt; CF and CC are also bringing legal claims against the Government, claiming that British agents were complicit in torturing them in a Somali prison.

&gt; Their lawyers claim the two men were assaulted and subjected to “mock executions” before being illegally deported back to Britain, which they say was “unlawful rendition”.

&gt; Danny Friedman, the barrister representing CF, told the High Court last week that “at least one, if not more, UK agents participated in unlawful conduct” including “hooding, assaults, mock execution and humiliation” when the men were first detained.

&gt; When visited by a British consular representative one month later, CF and CC complained of being ill-treated and said they suspected some of the perpetrators were British, but no action was taken, according to court papers.

&gt; CF also endured sleep deprivation and “forced standing” in Hargeisa prison in Somaliland, where he was held for 50 days without access to a court, Mr Friedman said.
Timothy Otty QC, the barrister representing CC, claimed there was “serious wrongful conduct on the part of the security services or other agents of the UK overseas”.

But yea, **FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR!!**

He's not going anywhere, and he's never reacted to regeneration like this. The closest is with the 2nd Doctor, but that was because the high council was forcing him to regenerate and exiling him to Earth. And he wasn't sad or upset that he 'had to go', but was purely angry with the high council that what they were doing to him was unjust.

It would have been good if it were anyone else, Hell, even Jack Harkness! But not The Doctor. It was just so uncharacteristic of him. Even his whole 'Time Lord Victorious' speech was just so pompous, and befitting more a character like The Master.

The only way any of this makes sense to me, within the context of Doctor Who, is that The Doctor was simply having a nervous breakdown near the end of his incarnation. After losing everyone in the Time War, and trying harder than ever to try and connect with humans, only to fail every time(Rose being sent to another Universe, Martha telling him to basically fuck off, and Donna being memory wiped, among others in individual episodes), that he was just having the greatest mental breakdown in the history of breakdowns, feeling more than ever that he was alone in the Universe.

Which, as I said, was all wiped clean as he got a clean slate after regeneration. Being of a more sound mind, I like to think he realizes just how dramatic he got, and has been able to move on much easier. That's why we're back to The Doctor that accepts regeneration with open arms, doesn't try and have love relationships with humans, and is more keen on going on adventures.

""The members of the jury were directed that they had to reach their verdict on the evidence which they had heard and on nothing else. They were not to speculate. These directions are of a familiar kind, but the judge stressed that, where the defendants were unrepresented, it was particularly important for the jury not to speculate. They were also told, specifically, that they must not speculate as to the reasons for the defendants' absence and that they should not assume that the defendants' failure to attend court in any way at all established that either or both of them were guilty. The jury should carefully assess the evidence as they would have done if the defendants had been present and had been represented by counsel. The judge also told the jury not to assume that the fact that the defendants had not been there to give evidence in any way at all helped the prosecution to prove their case.

His whole 'Another man saunters off' speech. I sometimes even have a hard time believing it was written as I have described it, especially knowing how RTD can be.

And I'm saying it's more unlike The Doctor, rather than like a Time Lord. Well, the complaining about regenerations is un-Time Lord like, but everything else is actually pretty fitting. I think I'd be more accepting of his behavior if, during the End of Time, there was a stronger theme of,""The Doctor has become what he most despises, his own race."" The Time Lords always felt like they could meddle in the affairs of the Universe as they saw fit, change things to suit themselves, and weren't afraid of consequences. Exactly what The Doctor became during the final specials.

As for 11, I would never expect The Doctor to completely avoid humans. By his 4th incarnation he absolutely adored them. I think his obsession as 10, though, borderlined on the creepy as he tried to get romantically involved.

I think the TARDIS herself put it best when she said,""You're always bringing in strays,"" in reference to companions, because that's what they've always been. They're almost like pets to The Doctor. Someone he can bring along to keep him company, and wag their tails in excitement as he does something amazing.

These aren't the actions of a government worried about money.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"-____-. Okay, here goes nothing.

&gt; If I go to the Olympics I want to see sport. If I watch the Olympics on TV I want to see sport. If I am taking part in the Olympics, I expect sport all around me.

&gt;At no point am I looking to see political or religious commentary.

What you want is all well and good but has no bearing on what other people want. Muslim sportspeople, for instance, might not want to compete during one of the times of day in which they should be praying. Anticorporatist sportspeople may take considerable umbrage at the proliferation of advertisements. Racists might only want white people to compete. There are a myriad of factors in putting on an event like this and a thousand reasons people from any group might object to the choices made.

&gt;It has no place in a sporting event. 

Here you're transforming your previously stated opinions about what *you* want to see at the Olympics into ostensible fact.

&gt;To give you some further food for thought: The Westboro Baptist Church are well know for picketing military funeral services and are widely regarded as a hate group. By your rational, they should be allowed to picket the Olympic arena / chant / sing / wave banners that entirely disrupt the enjoyment of others at the event. That is - after all - their right due to free speech.

&gt;But (and I don't think I'm alone here) I would sooner ban them from the event for any one of the above reasons than worry about their right to free speech. They've spoiled events in the past and they would spoil this one if they attended and were vocal. By your rational - that would have to be allowed due to the Human Rights act etc. etc. 

Believe me, I know all about the WBC. In what sense have they actually *spoiled* anything? They've said things that people disagree with, just as we are doing now. If my opinions annoy you, or your opinions annoy me, does that give either of us the right to have the other legally exiled from the discussion? I strongly hope you don't think so.

Deluded and horrible though they are, what they do takes place in public spaces which they as taxpayers are entitled access to. This is an important point. The Olympics, too, have received huge amounts of public money. If taxes are spent on something from which the taxpayer is forbidden from benefiting, that's called taxation without representation and as I am sure you are aware has in the past been a rather big deal on a few notable occasions. 

&gt; But before you start harping on about ""but where does it end?!"", please put down your tinfoil hat and consider that the Olympics are a huge celebration of sporting ability, intended as a competition between countries in good faith. They should not be anyone's personal political or religious soap box. Who are you (or they) to decide that their views are more important than the enjoyment and purpose of the event overall?

Don't patronize me. It's petty and frankly makes me not want to bother replying to you.

I'd like to focus mostly on the latter couple of sentences because your 'celebration of sporting ability' talk is pretty much in line with the bunkum the government has churned out.

&gt; They should not be anyone's personal political or religious soap box. Who are you (or they) to decide that their views are more important than the enjoyment and purpose of the event overall?

Again you're imposing your opinions on others. WHY should people not use the Olympics to attempt to disseminate their views? In what sense is it different to standing on Speakers' Corner? No-one is obliged to pay attention and no media organization is obliged to disseminate their opinions. If people ignore whichever hypothetical protesters we are talking about, they will likely give up and go home. Limiting peoples' ability to speak freely in public spaces is strongly symptomatic of authoritarianism because it puts nebulous qualities like 'enjoyment' or 'preserving dignity' ahead of inalienable human rights. I and the writers of the US Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and dozens of other constitutional documents all agree on this.

&gt;For the same reason I would not want an extremist group spoiling the funeral of a loved one - I would not want an extremist group spoiling a public event that is not by or for them. The reasoning behind this is the same reasoning that means a teaching will tell a disobedient kid to shut up when they stand up and start singing during a school event. 

A funeral is generally an invitation-only private event hosted by a private family in a private graveyard.
The Olympics are a public event to which anyone was invited to buy tickets. And, again, you're enforcing your own idea of 'spoiling'.

The officer committed an assault, but he has a total defence in lawful excuse if he honestly (even if mistakenly) believed he was acting to prevent a crime.

In your scenario, if you pushed jamierc because you thought that you were pushing him out of the way of the car (for example), you'd have the same defence.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Well when I judge Torres I block out the whole style of play thing since that is a valid, if necessary problem of last season. I judge him on the chances he does have and what he does with them, over the last 18 months he has not impressed more than a few times, a decline which begain in his last 18 months at Liverpool. What we have now is a player who hasn't set the world on fire for 3 years, at least. He may have won the Golden Boot at Euro 2012 and did look slightly better, though he still frustrated with the best and most creative support players possible behind him

We can't go in to our toughest ever season with just him and Sturridge. City have Aguero, Balotelli, Dzeko and Tevez, using 2 from 4 usually and the strongest striking line up in the world. United have Rooney, Chicharito, Welbeck and Berbatov. RvP took control of games and fired Arsenal to 3rd even without a world-class supply line, he made a lot of his chances himself and put a monumental shift in, so having the likes of Hazard and Mata feeding him passes will only be a step up

We lacked goals last season, we just can't go in to this one hoping that Torres comes good (again), Sturridge changes his attitude and starts playing well, Lukaku explodes on to the scene. All those things would need to happen before we could understand not bringing in an on-form striker, otherwise we'll most likely be offering anything for whoever we can get our hands on in January, like the £40m we offered last Jan for Higuain, after it became clear Drogba wasn't at his best and Nando couldn't hit a barn door

true,TheJizzard,null,null,"It's easy to judge when you're not in a position when that's you're only option.  I have friends who do it because they are students and i've even done it myself.  Door to door sales are usually under a lot of pressure themselves because if they perform poorley, they don't get paid, meaning they've just spent a twelve hour workday doing a shitty job for no money.  And yes, people are going to be mad at us.  We know they are going to be mad at us.  Personally, I never resent customers for being angry, pissed off or even just politely declining because I probably would too.  But the economic climate leaves many people in a position where it's either a shitty job or no job.  If anything it's just symptomatic of how bad things are economically, because if there were more jobs around there wouldn't be as many people who need to do shit ones to get by.  It's just a miserable situation for everyone involved, so we might as well just deal with it until things are looking better.

However, as I understand no one like cold callers, here's a tip which will make them go away quickly, politely and in a manner that makes no one feel bad.  TAKE HEED **If a door to door sales person knocks on your door, whatever it is they are selling, say you already have one, the door to door salesperson will shortly leave**.

Oh, and one more thing **If a salesperson curses at you when you close the door, please give him shit for it.  Don't let him get away with it, try and get his ID** If we're going to be bothering people in their own homes, it should at least be done with some sense of professionalism.  If you feel it's worthy of complaint, complain about it and stands up for your rights as a consumer, a homeowner and a person who just doesn't want to be bothered whilst they're trying to put the kids to sleep.

Also, generally there are plenty of salesmen who are on the level, but there are always some so desperate to perform well that they will resort to really dishonest methods to get sales.  Here's some i've known to have happened (and they are usually from the ones who get the most sales per week)

1)  If a cold caller tells you anything is free, they are lying.  Report them immediately.  I once worked with a guy who would tell people that the lovefilm subs he was selling were 100% FREE, instead of buying one month and getting another 2 free.  He got sacked, you'll be pleased to know.  I never liked him, he looked like draco malfoy and had an american psycho vibe about him.

2)  If they knock after 8pm, call the cops on them (or at least complain).  It's unsociable hours and they shouldn't be.  It's actively encouraged by the office, so PLEASE report this behaviour so it gets stopped.  It sucks for you and it sucks for the salesmen who have to stay out till late because they office is giving them shit.

**tl;dr**

People hate salesmen, and salesmen hate being salesmen.

His wife has said numerous times she doesn't want to leave the city and his kids are happy too

RvP won't go for £10m, but at £20m say, Arsenal would cut their losses and cash in. Fee plus salary means Arsenal would be £25m better off on a 29 year old player leaving in a year for free. If we wanted Cavani he would cost £35m, easily, and be on £125k a week roughly. RvP would earn more, probably alongside the top earners at £180k but that 50k a week extra is only £2.5m a year.

Even [no cold calling](http://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/content/no-cold-caller-zones) zones are still ok for these to operate in.

I know people who do this and earn good money from it, preying on the elderly. I know people who work for charities and take the best donations for themselves (dead folks TV's, computers etc).

It is nice to give things to charity, and I am in no way saying that it is a bad thing to give to charity - perceptions have shifted maybe and the person giving gets the emotional feedback of donating, but they should really know what their donation actually accomplishes, in most cases it is nothing more than a worker getting your old telly or hi-fi - if they have too much gear they put it on ebay for themselves.

edit: I hope some people see this and realise what charities are in the UK - sure there are some good ones,  but it really is a big fucking con, it is modern flagellation.

So an independent Scottish military would be far smaller, and far closer to the armed forces Iceland has than to the existing British military.

While some have been pragmatic and understood his decision, most are extremely pissed off. At this stage, what does he care what they think? He'll be looking for the best deal for himself. As my Arsenal friend says, ""He's gone anyway, sell him to whoever pays the most. City, Chelsea or Anzhi."" If City don't step up, Chelsea should certainly seize the opportunity. The more RvP talks, the less fans will give a shit where he goes so long as the club gets a good deal

The act of wanting to leave and making that desire public shows he doesn't really care about the Arsenal fans, otherwise he would have kept it private and let the club accept an offer before saying he's ready to leave. The wording of his letter makes me think he's trying to weaken Arsenal's position at the bargaining table, so if a club they don't want to sell to comes up with the money, there's less chance of them rejecting it out of hand

I think Sturridge would be used as a makeweight in the deal. Similar to the Modric situation, both RvP and Luka are players we want/need at teams who could definitely use Sturridge and give him the game time he wants

As for Ashley, for all the hate the Arsenal fans have for him, the self-satisfied look and his comments after winning the Champions League were the perfect response. We're an attractive proposition to any player, have the money to pull off almost any transfer and are situated in the most desirable city to live in

The experience vs. potential debate varies with each case I'd say. In terms of goalkeeper, we have a very experienced operator there so can afford to experiment with a young starlet, Cech is insurance and it's up to the starlet to dethrone him on merit

Same could apply to centre back, left back, possibly right back

Up front, I would not call Torres a safe bet, far from it in fact. If it takes Schurrle a season to get going we're still no better off in 2012-2013. RvP could  be banging them in for us while Torres continues to improve, we have 2 games every week for the first few months of the season on average so plenty to go around too

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"We haven't been on a spending spree so much as a borrowing spree. Plenty of countries with successful economies have a bigger public sector than ours, but they are financed by taxation, not by borrowing. 

Their public sectors tend to be more efficient than ours as well. They haven't wasted money on things like PFI and Tony Blair's wars.

Government borrowing is only part of the story. Artificially cheap credit has led to unsustainable household and business borrowing as well.

Even more significant than the borrowing is the financial crash and subsequent bailout. Even if previous governments had paid down the national debt, we'd still be in quite a lot of trouble.

The debt is a problem, it's unsustainable, and even if our credit rating stays good we're paying too much interest. In the long term it desperately needs to be addressed. This is different from saying that we have no money though. 

Now for the detail:

&gt;I don't know anything about SSNs,

The coalition agreement says that renewal of Trident is up for discussion. Pre-empting this, the government has ordered the propulsion units for the new SSNs at a cost of a billion pounds. This could easily have been postponed if we were really that short of money.

&gt;50% tax rate cut really isn't a factor in the economy. It's 99% only a political point.

A billion here, a billion there, eventually it all adds up to serious money, especially if we really did have no money left. The political bit is important too though: it's important that the burden of any cuts don't fall on the poorest.

&gt;The re-organisation of the NHS is designed to save money in the long term.

The NHS reorganisation will make things worse. Even if you don't agree, such longer term planning has no place if there really is no money left.

PFI is a scam. Why don't the government pay a top firm of lawyers to go through the contracts with a fine toothcomb and see if we can weasel out of them? One reason might be because the government are still signing massive new PFI contracts. 

&gt;And also Jimmy Carr, Vodafone and other high-profile cases have come out.

They have come out but they haven't been dealt with. The tax code needs to be reformed root and branch, and in many ways it could be made simpler. Some of the complexity is to open loopholes lobbied for by special interests. Then some further complexity is to somewhat close those loophole. And so on.

Instead of trying to drag him AWAY from the risk, he slams into the kid, spins him into the line of oncoming traffic, chokeholds the kid off the bmx, the kid attempts to recover balance whilst being chokeheld and the bike falling from under him.. which you then see almost, if not actually just going under the chase car's nose.

The only reason the kid's legs aren't wrapped up in the bike at the time and possibly dragged to under the chase car is the ""olympic guardian"" idiot trips over the bike, and the kid goes flying. His own legs are just missed being entangled as well.

That's a horribly dangerous tackle, and honestly, based on the context of the video, I'm not sure whether to call it that the kid got too close whilst avoiding the crowd, aggressive mis-handling, or they really believed the kid was going for it. 

We'd need to see more footage.. 

There's a longer version here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOADzgjO8GI

This version shows the kid speeding up, so it could be a legit stop, but the way he's looking, I'm not certain if he's just trying to avoid hitting someone in front of him. The more I watch it, the more it almost seems he's moving into the ""Bubble"" to dodge the person who appears to have just jumped out at him.

After graduating and getting left out in the cold from a graduate scheme that ran out of money, I had to go back to my part time job in retail for the guts of a year before finding myself a job. I must have used every recruitment centre in Belfast. I have to say, my general opinion of them is that at face value, they seem like places who will do their utmost for you, continually calling you about positions upcoming, and what areas you can explore, but after a while, it feels like they are just throwing people into any position. In all my experience Abacus where probably the best. Theres a guy in there called Stuart John, who took me in for an initial interview (just a chat) and he really tried his utmost to get me into a position I wanted to be in. Unfortunatley out of the 6 interviews he set me up for, they may have been above my current skill and experience level, but I was surprised at the calibre of roles he was putting me in for.

Other places like Lynn Recruitment, Van Rath etc where sending me out vacancies for office cleaning etc, which was a bit of a joke. After a while I just considered going into clerical or admin work, which a lot of the agencies seemed to cater for, but even within admin, a lot of the positions where barely more than part time work.

All I can say about these agencies are, go in with a bit of a broad mind, dont narrow yourself down like I did in the start. I may have wasted a full year looking for my ideal graduate job when I could have been out getting basic experience as a foot up. Thankfully now I am in a half decent position getting some actual good experience that will lend me in good stead for the grad jobs im still applying for.

Most see Fear Her as shit. Love &amp; Monsters close behind. Not many like the 2010+ new Daleks. People love the weeping angels and the Silence but people are sick of others posting about them 24/7. Most people love Blink and rate it as the best episode/the one to show a newbie. Most don't like the Movie but watch it anyway.

While most don't mind her that much, at least some are sick of Rose. Most people love 10 with 11 then 4 being close behind. Most people think 9 is underrated while others think the rest are underrated because of that. A fair few people do not like the way Moff is turning the show into ""The Ponds"" (that is a matter of opinion in itself). Most people loved Doctor's Daughter and want her back but sick of people constantly voicing that and partially want her back just to shut them up.

RTD lovers/Moffat Haters tend to start arguments about RTD vs Moffat (Sorry...but they do!) where generally, Moffat wins out (but only just to be fair). Probably because people like me are sick of people hating on Moffat. Give him a chance at least. I don't recall people hating on RTD the same way just two and a bit seasons in.

I'm sure I could remember other stuff if prompted.

No, I said *some* people stereotype *Conservatives* like that not English people. 

&gt;victim complex

How did you get from my ""I'm not saying its something people are very angry about...its only small"" to a victim complex and then you imply I said that this victim complex was ""what really matters"". I specifically said it was not what really matters and in fact is not even a voting issue, its just a feeling with no connections with nationalism. 

&gt;the majority of people didn't vote for the conservatives

Once again, not true. [I'll link you again to the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/region/48.stm) with the 2010 election results for England where the vast majority of seats were voted Conservative. Now they won with 40% meaning 60% didn't want them but that unrepresentative result is because of our useless voting system which almost never guarantees an absolute majority in an election but the British public categorically rejected a system that would in 2011 so clearly people are OK with the 2010 result. 

&gt;English people are so unpatriotic...many Scottish people are absurdly nationalistic

You seem to be incredibly upset that English people are not patriotic and yet completely disgusted (your words) by Scottish patriotism. I want to call that a double standard but its such an understatement it might not be worth it.

&gt;if Scottish MPs could not vote in English matters, which of course they shouldn't be able to, English tuition fees would not have been tripled.

I have no idea where you got this. [Here is a chart of who voted on the tuition fees bill.](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2010-12-09&amp;number=151&amp;sort=party). You will see that of the 41 Labour constituencies in Scotland all voted against the bill. Of the Lib Dem ones, 7 voted for - 4 voted against, of the Conservatives, 1 voted yes and the SNP, all 6 voted against making a whopping 13.6% of Scottish MPs were for and 86.4% of Scottish MPs voting against, 8 for - 51 against. 
As for England you will see that 296 Conservatives voted yes, 26 Lib Dems voted yes making 40.3% voting against and 59.7% voting for. Clearly Scotland was a bastion against the change in tuition fees **much** more so than England and even if all Scottish MPs voted against it would have made no difference. 

&gt;the Barnett formula which gives the Scottish significantly more money per head than any other nationality within the UK.

Incorrect. [England gets 79% of all the money given out (Chart 9.1) and Northern Ireland gets most per head (Chart 9.2, look at the tabs at the bottom to change the chart numbers).](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/pesa2011_chapter9.xlsx) However, its true that all the devolved areas including Scotland gets more than England per head but it then seems strange that after complaining of this unfairness you find Scottish independence so objectionable. If you don't want to over-fund Scotland would it not be even better if we didn't fund them at all?

&gt;more rights than anyone else

 &lt;Citation needed&gt; If there are any difference in rights i'm not aware of them

&gt;image of big bad oppressive Englishmen controlling them

Again, and to conclude, your misinterpreting me. I said it was a small feeling not oppression. Clearly if someone thinks it is oppression they are wrong but that's nowhere near what I said.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"For starters, yes, The Doctor is unique in what he does. Most Time Lords keep to themselves on Gallifrey. In fact, when the Time Lord high council wanted some dirty work, they would usually find some way to blackmail The Doctor into doing it for them.

That being said, I'll move onto the time lock. The Doctor, during his 8th regeneration, got ahold of what's called The Great Key of Rassilon. Normally this key would be used to power what's called a De-Mat gun. This gun could erase individuals from all of time and space, exactly like the cracks in time. However, this wasn't good enough for the war, as it could only do this to one person/item at a time. So The Doctor fashioned what became to be known as The Moment that had similar properties, but worked on a much grander scale. This is what he used to wipe out both sides of the time war, and time lock everyone. So, essentially, he wiped everyone out from time and space, and then time locked it so nobody could change what he did. This is why he never runs into Time Lords, because he erased their entire history.",0,1341783470,null,0,false,0,c5b74yw,t3_w8ity,t1_c5b74yw,t3_w8ity,null,1429327252,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12
true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"No, Time Lord society is very isolationist, bureaucratic, corrupt, xenophobic, and superior. It is a general rule that Time Lords do not leave Gallifrey to go off galavanting with lesser races. The Doctor is an exile and a reprobate. He is very unusual. Other adventuring Time Lords include the Master, the Rani, the Monk, the Corsair and Drax. There's the evil Valeyard.

Time Lords also don't travel within Gallifrey's history because of the transduction barriers that protect the planet temporally. They also prevent Time Lords from meeting each other in the wrong order.

All Time Lords are Gallifreyan but not all Gallifreyans are Time Lords. There are Time Lords, those living in mid town, and those living in low town who particularly dislike the higher up ""Timeys"", as they're called.

The Doctor is said to have used ""the Moment"" to Time Lock the time war and remove it/displace it from time. Putting it in its own pocket- in the Void.

I'm sure this has been addressed, though I can't recall it.  Wouldn't the removal of all Time Lords from all of everything cause a paradox?  Or does the super-duper De-Mat gun contain a paradox-hold-y thing?  The obvious paradox being if all Time Lords and(?) Gallifreyans are removed from existence then (presumably) one or more of The Doctor's parents would never exist.  This, of course, would make it rather difficult for The Doctor to use his Time Lock thingamajig.

I apologize, I feel like I'm being difficult but I swear that's not my intention.  I only saw the old Doctor Who episodes when I was quite young.  I am nearly certain I did not see all of them and those I did see were almost certainly not in the correct order.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Current Masters student also from the Department of Engineering here, the uni itself is fantastic, it's a proper old English university with some amazing architecture and great history to it (Sir Winston Churchill was the chancellor!). As you are probably aware, the uni has a great reputation and in my opinion it definitely lives up to it, I did my undergraduate degree at a pretty average UK university and the difference is like night and day, the lecturers here are not only true experts in their field but they are passionate and engaging when giving lecturers too.


The Uni is ranked in the top 10 in the UK in most fields and it's in the top 5 for a few (including my field). The facilities are good, the libraries are well stocked. If I was to raise a downside, it's that because the uni is quite large (some of my units have around 100 students registered to them) and because the lecturers are very busy, you may not get as much personal tuition and feedback as you would like. In a similar vein, you may find it difficult to get in contact with lecturers or your personal tutor, some flat-out refuse to answer emails and have a very small window for personal contact (if they have a window for it at all). None of this bothers me because I prefer to work/study on my own but some people in my year have raised it as an issue.


Bristol is good city, some great pubs/restaurants, not too big so you can generally walk everywhere, some interesting landmarks, friendly people. To be honest, I'm  not *as* impressed with Bristol as everyone else seems to be (sorry /r/Bristol, I mean no disrespect!) but that's just my personal opinion, the majority of people I know absolutely love Bristol and many of my friends have moved here permanently. I'm sure you will enjoy it here.


I've only visited Dean's Court but it seems nice, it looks good and there seems to be quite a few international students so you won't be the only non-Brit. It's just down the road from the main campus so there's no excuse for being late to lectures!


One last thing, I know this probably goes without saying but if your course is anything like mine then be prepared to work your ass off, the workload makes the final year of my UG degree seem like a joke and quite a few people on my course have struggled with the amount of work.

true,TLKv3,null,null,"The difference is that the whole mystery and allure to River Song initially was the fact that she seemed like she would only appear every so often in the future as a ""pleasant surprise cameo"" character. But then she proceeded to show up again, and again, and again, and again, and then had an entire Series plot surrounding her with no suspense whatsoever. We all called who River Song would inevitably turn out to be and Moffat didn't even try to swerve us with a surprise to give us something to speculate more on. Instead he gave us the sappy cop-out cliche of ""oh they love each other and are married, you're welcome.""

The difference with the taking down of the Daleks was that whole story took an entire series before we found out what the end game actually was. When River showed up the first time the show became all about her. Not to mention the countless plotholes to the ""Cracks In The Wall"" that got brushed under the rug with that horrible ""reboot the universe to fix it!"" ending. What an uncreative and hack way of solving it. Especially in the next Series... they do it AGAIN!

The Doctor can have relationships. I'm fine with that. But the difference between The Doctor/Rose and Doctor/River is that The Doctor/Rose developed over time and wasn't just immediately ""HEY EVERYONE, ITS CLEAR WE'RE FLIRTING AND IN LOVE!"" Doctor/Rose had actual development leading up to the fact that they had feelings for each other. And the worst part? Rose isn't even brought up when Eleven decides to basically jump ship to River. 4 Series of character development again brushed under the rug for the sake of Eleven falling for River because it was convenient.

And the fact she's given so much screen time is exactly why it's become The River Song Show. She has taken center stage over The Doctor which should never be the case to begin with.

All those questions all lead to yet another hack job cop-out ending of a ""reboot the universe!""",0,1341793684,null,0,false,0,c5b9afg,t3_w8e3r,t1_c5b9afg,t1_c5b94xw,null,1429328266,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The Doctor always changes dramatically like that. Since 1965 when Hartnell quit. It takes a while, but as you see more incarnations, you'll either think he's more and more different or you'll see trends that carry across all 11 (and alt. continuity).

When I watched the first Doctor for the first time I thought he was a real jerk. But when he left and 2 came along I missed his grandfatherly and curmudgeonly attitude. Who was this silly cosmic hobo? But I liked number 2 fast. And I was very sad to see him go. Especially when replaced by the super serious and boring 3. But now three is my second favorite Doctor. And despite going on to 4, I still missed three a lot. And I had a ton of fun with 4's run, but after 7 whole seasons i was ready for 5 who was a huge change. I found 5 kind of bland (until the radio dramas changed my mind) and I was very happy for 6 to come along with his totally opposite loud and flamboyant attitude. And happiest most of all was I to see the 7th Doctor come around. The dark yet funny and mysterious Time's Champion. And I was bummed to see 7 change into 8 but 8 has such a love for life and beauty ( a real Casanova with that hair) that you can't *not* like 8. And of new Who i love 9's personality the most and 10 and 11's runs are tied despite series 1 having the strongest series arc *structurally*.

That's me rambling. The more Who you see, the more and more your view of the doctor changes. I watched new Who out of order for the first time so i never had one particular incarnation solidified as THE incarnation for me.

2) are primarily a provider but have a horrible left/right foot (think Stewart Downing, cue laugh track).

Players like Hazard, Marin, Schurrle, etc. have skill on the ball, pace, and ability with both feet. None of the three are heavily dependent on one foot over the other, though they do of course have favorites. None of them are extremely keyed in as providers, nor as shooters in the Sturridge/Hulk mold.

I'd say we will probably give Hazard his preferred position on the left side of the attack, but why not play Marin/Schurrle on the right? And for that matter, what is wrong with playing Ramires on the right?

I know playing the inverted winger is en vogue lately (Robben, Hulk, Sturridge, Ronaldo), but it is not like we are desperate for specifically a right-sided winger and are screwed if we do not find one.

Essentially, The Master had ran out of regenerations, but had found an alternative way of sustaining life. During this time in his life, staying low from the Time Lords(Who presumed him dead), he had joined forces with The Daleks.

Of course, this being The Master, he wasn't able to *NOT* double cross them. As soon as The Daleks found out that he was double crossing him, they had him exterminated. I believe the 'trial' they refer to is more of the Daleks discussing whether or not he was actually double crossing them.

So, before being exterminated, The Master sends out a psychic distress call to The Doctor, informing him of his immanent death. The Master requests that The Doctor come to grab his remains and bring them back to Gallifrey as a dying wish.  The Doctor decides that he can't refuse a man's dying wish, let alone a man who he was able to once call his best friend.

Berbatov's best in a league season was 15. Keane's was 16. Defoe's is 18, and that included a freak 5 goals in a single match against Wigan which makes it look better than it was. Kanoute scored 14 in his two seasons; Crouch scored 12 in his two and he barely missed a match. Pavlyuchenko's best was 10, Bent's was 12, Mido's was 11 and Rebrov hit 9. 

Adebayor got 17 at his first attempt, coming into the team cold having completely missed preseason; if he'd not had those three goals wrongly ruled out around Christmas, he would have hit 20. Nobody's done that for us since Klinsmann almost 20 years ago. And that's without mentioning Adebayor's 11 assists.

No he's not been perfect, but he's been very good and there's every chance of him pushing on and improving on his form from his first year with the club.

Classic DW featured a TARDIS that was innacurate and broken; it rarely worked. The TARDIS would arrive at the beginning of the adventure and leave at the end, eventually landing at the next accidental destination for another unplanned adventure. There weren't too many side trips within a story like there is now (eg. the TARDIS being used to transport a character between two places within one story, or moving back and forth within a timeline in the same episode).

The third Doctor had much TARDIS knowledge deliberately ""blocked"" from his mind by the Time Lords, only travelling from location to location on Earth with no time travel. He eventually earned the right to have this knowledge restored.

In the fourth Doctor's run he implemented a randomiser when eluding the Black Guardian. This meant even the Doctor had no idea where the TARDIS would land.

I'll try to adress your argument and not your example though. i think what you're saying is that Paul McGann is a better actor than the movie makes him appear, and he could have done a good job as a doctor, but we only saw him in one movie because that movie was made in the 90s and the 90s couldn't handle that kind of script.
