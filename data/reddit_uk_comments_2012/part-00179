That kind of sums up how bizarre the match was. We were outstanding for 20 minutes or so, dropped off a bit, the goal went in and our heads went. In the second half we stopped playing our football and played right into Villa's hands.

I haven't watched replays but to me all three goals seem like Lucas was absent. No one to close down the shot from 25 yards, no one to cut out the obvious cut back, no one to clear up for Joe Cole's fuck up.

Where the hell was Suso? He should be ahead of Joe Cole who was poor at West Ham apart from the finish, and was poor again today.

Sahin can be a great player for us but in order to really get the best out of him he needs lots of time playing with theses guys, something Rodgers is weary of.
The other issue is who he can replace - Allen is not going to move because he happens to be Rodgers' preferred midfield general, this basically leaves a resurgent Lucas and Steven Gerrard himself.

Neither would most Christians if truth be told. Take incredibly dangerous risks? Certainly. But always with the expectation and hope, however remote, that they *might* survive. 

That is why the prospect of facing a foe that embraces suicide attacks willingly is so horrifying. People with such zeal and conviction are an especially frightening prospect, as everyone knows that performing the ultimate sacrifice goes against human nature. And the fact is it's a tactic that's used even when it may be unnecessary. Irish terrorists showed it was always possible to cause devastation using explosives packed vehicles alone. Islamic terrorists know that having it done by a suicide bomber adds significantly to the psychological impact on the target group.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"&gt; The majority of people who are going in to buy 3 litres of Frosty Jacks are poor alcoholics *[citation needed]*.

I say this as someone who drinks some very expensive drinks, but also some cheap ones too. Heck, I wrote a series on cocktails you can make with Buckfast tonic wine earlier this year.

&gt; offering them it at a cheaper price is encouraging them to buy 6 litres of cider which most will consume a lot sooner than if they bought 2x3 litres on two separate occasions, meaning they'll be doing their wallets and health damage.

Alcoholics will get whatever alcohol they need when they need to. If they can't get enough to get their buzz from the supermarket in the booze section they'll get it from hand cleaner or something else. I think it's naive to automatically associate a 2 for £6 deal with an increase in alcoholic damage. Seriously, I can get 3 bottles of wine for £10 in Sainsbury's or supermarket own vodka at under £8 round my way.

&gt; I think there should be regulation on these sort of ""deals"" by supermarkets, some people aren't intelligent enough to know they're being screwed.

There should be, but minimum pricing isn't where it should be. Increasing duty on certain classes of drinks would work and could be used to raised funds to provide support to alcoholics, or alternatively changing the way alcohol duty is charged (which would be great as it's been screwed with by multiple chancellors with different priorities) to reflect social and personal harm would be great too. At the end of the day it's not about people being screwed or smart enough, it's about responsible drinking and providing the right combination of care, support and help in the community for those dealing with alcoholism and those around them while not penalising the poor.

&gt; It isn't at all compatible to people buying a bottle of gin.

I'd say it's definitely comparable, although [vodka](http://www.supermarketownbrandguide.co.uk/search.php?SearchString=vodka&amp;Search.x=0&amp;Search.y=0&amp;score=&amp;price=0&amp;pricevalue=0.00) gets you a better deal (check the Aldi Tamova).

However 'faith' is not required when studying **any** branch of science. You don't need it at any point.

Graduates who are not aware of the theory of evolution should not be at University studying any subject. It is primary or secondary school level stuff. GCSE Level.

The Muslims protesting were completely aware of evolution and the threat it poses to their religious beliefs. It proposes that humanity developed over a long period of time through the process of evolution. This is in contrast to Allah creating the Universe and everything in it.

You simply cannot hold both beliefs in your mind at the same time and accept both. 

No matter what course they are studying, they have a system of values. Science or religion. Each needs to be studied separately. Mixing the two does not work, because they are contrasting systems.

**TL;DR:** 

&gt; Unlike driving, most cycling takes place in areas of high pedestrian activity, but 
it poses far less risk to pedestrians than motor vehicles. This is the case even for 
pavement cycling and red light jumping, neither of which CTC condones.

&gt; According a Freedom of Information (FoI) request made in 2008, in London, where cycle and 
pedestrian flows are high and signalled junctions ubiquitous: 

&gt;**No pedestrian was killed in collision with a cyclist going through a red light between 1998-2007

true,Tven0,english,Warwickshire,"No, but you did suggest that by studying other subjects these students would be ignorant of the theory of evolution. I would argue that they aren't ignorant of it. They are aware of it, and have chosen to accept their belief instead of embracing science. However, in day to day life, they have chosen to study how real world machinery, physics or biology operates. 

I am aware that people who are religious do indeed study science. **However, I think it is a hindrance.** You're willing to accept blind faith on one matter, and then require absolute proof on another. The vast majority of people would find that incredibly difficult.

To go back to my original point: Islam is not compatible with science. Sadly, in the end, you have to choose. Islam accepts no criticism, so it can be dismissed without criticism. You cannot debate it scientifically, so it needs to be kept separate from science. They operate in different spheres of discussion. I'm not saying either one is correct, I am just saying you need to discuss each one on it's own.

Islam is spiritual and Science is factual. I would support the protestors! They have no place together and so should not be debated together. They were quite within their right to protest against it.

I think itd be interesting if Morganna purposefully sent the girl to Camelot because she knew Mordred cared about her and Arthur would execute her. 

EDIT: did anyone notice how similar the scene when Arthur found Mordred with cara behind the tree with the scene in season 3 when Uther caught Gwen and Arthur together? When Arthur and Mordred got caught they both said that they will leave Camelot and never come back just so their Gwen/cara don't get executed. In fact, I think they said the exact same line. It looks like they both have strong emotions for the women they love. I wonder if arthur would've reacted the same way if Gwen died. Both arthur and uther showed no mercy. I think they wanted to show that Arthur may in fact be just like his father. However, we see at the end that he isn't the same because he gave her another chance to repent.

Very true, but the problem is that the two accidents could have easily been avoided if a) the lorry driver was driving legally, paying attention to the road and not his phone and b) if the chap getting out out of the car looked around him before getting out.

Saying that, the second is a genuine accident, and I'd say the cyclist deserves a little blame for riding within a car doors width of parked cars. Yes it may get drivers behind you angry and you will get honked and swore at, but if you take the lane and ride well out of reach of a car door, you cannot be hit, as well as forcing those behind you to only be able to overtake if it is safe and not try and squeeze you out.",0,1355614725,null,0,false,0,c7h6ijw,t3_14w5ab,t1_c7h6ijw,t1_c7h5oky,null,1430684110,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I started off feeling that Mordred was a good person with only good intentions.. Worried about Merlin turning Mordred against Arthur because of his fear of him.. and hated Arthur for showing no mercy.  By the end, I felt sorry for Merlin and Arthur because they tried to come to a peaceful conclusion in the end, but Morganna had her nasty little fingers wrapped around her so tightly that even in the face of death she stood her ground directly opposing Arthur.  I even wanted Mordred to bust out of his cell and save her in some feat of magical prowess that has yet to be seen on the show.. And I understood how his anger propelled him toward Morganna.

Still, lol.. I think something I hope for in every episode is Merlin revealing he has magic.  When Mordred was standing against the Knights and Arthur about to use his magic I thought Merlin might jump in the way and stop the attack with his own magic.  When Percival knocked Mordred out.. gah!

Can't wait for the next two episodes.. I hope he overtly attempts to use magic in front of Arthur and just looks silly, but as the danger nears and Merlin tries harder.. his magic bursts out.

true,anotherface,ni,Northern Ireland,"As a member of the public who has an intimate knowledge of the Jobcentre and its workings, I agree with almost everything you say.

My one critique of your post in defence of Jobcentre employees is your belief that the minority of call centre workers are complete shitheads.

Each Jobcentre differs due to the staff employed at the top, and unfortunately this attitude permeates down to the people they employ.

The number of people who care about the well-being of those signing on is next to none in all the Jobcentres I have encountered. It was easy to tell when an employee was new, they'd be in their early 20's and have that bright-eyed and helpful look about them. This would gradually be replaced over the next few weeks with a dead-eyed administrative gaze, usually followed by their permanent removal.

The only staff remaining in my local Jobcentre when last I was there were split into two groups: those who were efficient and clinical in their detachment from the latest number called to their desk and those who treated each person with open disdain.

Whilst the ire you suffer is not warranted, some of the aggression that you face is a knock-on effect from people who have been treated poorly in the past by Jobcentres. When failure is reinforced every fortnight by a petty idiot with a confirmation bias it is understandable that people would eventually get angered. As a result, it just doesn't come into some people's heads that you would care at all.

Had I met you when I was unemployed I would have been courteous and respectful, but I would not have expected you to care in the slightest because that was what I was used to.

Last but not least, the current unemployment rate is in part the fault of governments past and present, so inadvertently within your caps-lock lampooning there is a kernel of truth.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that unless you've worked up and down the country, your experience is only of one Jobcentre. There are many which have a far worse environment.

Hoolahan's new contract is phenominal news - he is ghe creative heart of our midfield, and right niw we don't have anything else like him. Butterfield certainly has potential though, and in a few years time, with the right training etc. he could turn into a worthy replacement.
Best players today were hoolahan and pilkington. Nice to see pilkington getting a good game, previously this season he has certainly not lived up to the heights he reached last year, and i think he still needs to work on his deliveries into the box. He could have easily scored 2 if it wasn't for al-habsi's wonder save in the second half.
Holt's injury sounds like ljttle more than a pulled/strained muscle, so at worst we are probably looking at 2 games out, mabye 3. For me, steve morrison seems like the obvious replacement - he seems to be working much harder this season than he was last, and showed that he can finish when given enough opportunitues against aston villa on tuesday.

What sick depraved planet are _you_ from? Do you think that there are no gay children? No pedophile children? Most pedophiles find about their sexual orientation between 12 and 15 years old http://www.b4uact.org/science/survey/01.htm.

The inmense taboo censors their voices but slowly there are more news story about them: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2012/09/stop_childhood_sexual_abuse_how_to_treat_pedophilia_.html Slate made a good report about a 14 year old pedophile and in Sarah D. Goode's book ""Understanding and addressing adult sexual attraction to children"" the story of David, a 15 year old pedophile. Or in B4UACT, about a 13 year old pedophile www.b4uact.org/matthew.htm.


So yes, just like there are gay kids and straight kids, there are pedo kids. 


Again, its you who need to get help. This children, pedophile or gay, deserve to be respected and cherished, not discriminated for not being straight. No one deserves to be discriminated for having a different sexual orientation, even less a 14 year old kid who discover that he/she is a pedo/gay.


&gt;I worked for several years with a gay rights organisation and they would be disgusted and upset by your words

If anything that only shows their bigotry against sexual minorities.

May be bench him for the next game and play Sahin instead (can a broken nose really keep a player out? Can't he just wear one of the face things?). I know Stevie is the face of LFC, and I couldn't love him more than I do, but when he doesn't play the way we know he can, then BR should be confident enough to sub him.

After Henderson's improved performance in the past few weeks, I feel like he has earned a starting spot. Not sure why Suso has stopped featuring now, and Joe Cole is getting more of a chance. I wasn't impressed with Cole today.

TL;DR - I love Rodgers and his managing style, just feel that he needs to be a bit more bold with the team selection. No player is untouchable, including Allen and our Gerrard. Sorry Stevie &lt;3.

Then I remembered that the show's called MERLIN, and had a sad.

It's way too much, way too fast, for Mordred to go from the most adorable knight in the kingdom to ready to kill Arthur and ally himself with someone responsible for the death of a friend of his (anyone in Camelot still remember Elyan?) 

And Morgana's reaction at the end . . . . . . to be fair, I wasn't going to be happy with anything other than ""Really, him?"" or ""I fucking knew it!"" and no way were we going to get either of those so . . . . .

I didn't really like the plot of the episode too much... As predicted from the preview, Mordred betrays Camelot for a girl. But what's worse, she entirely brought it on herself. Arthur went to help her; she tried to stab him. Arthur offered her a repeal of her sentence (which she clearly didn't deserve); she told him to go to hell.

Mordred even saw her stab at least one person (and knew she'd killed others) who hadn't really done anything to her... Is that really a reason to betray Arthur and especially Merlin?

Ah well. At least Morgana finally knows Emrys' identity... It'll certainly make things interesting. And yeah, I'm guessing Arthur won't find out until the very end...

The last episode better be as awesome as we're hoping.

&gt;but when it's not your normal position you sometimes lose something. He is a great player and a strong character who can only get better for this club. 

Anyone who saw Mikel play CAM during the under 20 World Cup will tell you he had something special. That was the reason United sign him. After he joined us Mourinho changed his position to a CDM and as the season progress he was told to stay back and roam the free space in front the back four. Causing him to lose his flair, I think he doesnt want the same to happen to Luiz. Plus you cannot automatically think Luiz will have that same performance against Top or Even average European sides. You cannot judge his performance based on the Monterrey game. Monterrey were horrible in that game. Lets wait till we played Aston Villa, Norwich or Everton.

Mikel at U20 World Cup was an attacking midfielder now he's a defensive midfielder who job is not to worry about the offense. since he joined Chelsea he have never played his original position.

I'm inclined to believe that Rodgers is actually being pragmatic (rather than a misty-eyed optimist) when he speaks about the positions we could be in. We know that we don't deserve to be in the top four, but a top four position is not out of reach for us. By comparison, if we had continued our early season form and results, we would have a relegation battle on our hands.

It really is just Rodgers' way of asking for patience and building hope for the future. Consider Arsenal of last year. Sometimes just anything can happen.

&gt;In 2010/11, the report estimates that a total tax contribution of **£63bn** was made by the financial services sector, accounting for 12.1% of the total UK tax take. This figure represents a rise in the figure of £53.4bn (11.2% of tax receipts) reported for the 2010 study; a rise attributed to higher figures for corporation tax paid, irrecoverable value added tax, and employment taxes borne and collected.

To put that figure into context, for the same financial year, that £63bn was more than two thirds of the cost of the entire national NHS budget, or in other terms, more than what was spent on our entire education budget.

Most of my childhood was spent being alone, kept in my room by my mother who decided that it was some great sin to allow me to socialize or play with the neighborhood kids, causing me to spend my childhood being alone. Then add in the fact that a large bit of my late childhood and teenage years was spent moving from place to place to the point where I realized that I enjoyed traveling and I didn't mind being uprooted because I was always excited about meeting new people. Oh and to really further things worse, by the time I reached my twenty-first birthday, I was convinced that it was dangerous to my own emotional well-being to get attached to people because they always leave (friendships dissipated during and after high school, my mom walking out on my dad and I when I was ten, my father's death right before Christmas when I was twenty...).
I yearn to travel, see everything there is to be seen, but my health issues and lack of funds make such a thing an impossibility. But in the years since my darkest phase, I've learned to see that I do have a family in my group of friends and that I know that I'm never alone if I don't want to be.

TL;DR: I enjoy Doctor Who due to wish fulfillment of traveling plus being able to actually relate to The Doctor of all people, especially the later bit of the Tenth.

9's last words to Rose (no crying but caused me to feel a bit bittersweet about it)
10's farewell to Rose in Doomsday (the music used throughout the two parter wasn't helping any)

true,listyraesder,null,null,"48fps 3D exhibition IS the very limit of our current technological ability. When projecting at 24fps, digital projectors must flash each frame two times in order to cut down on flicker. (If you've ever looked down the viewfinder of a film camera while shooting 24fps you'll see that at least 50% of the time there is no image; this is what the double-flash eliminates.)

Now, with almost all 3D systems in use, a similar thing needs to occur between Left Eye and Right Eye. Because almost every system (except IMAX) relies on a single projector alternating between left and right eye images there will be a sort of flicker, but instead of image-blank-image, it would be a flicker between eyes. This is remedied by projecting a triple-flash so each ""frame"" is projected like this: L-R-L-R-L-R. Each eye being projected 3 times per frame. So for 24fps that's 144 flashes per second.

At 48fps it needs to be 288 flashes per second. Why is it important? Because the fact that you never see both Left and Right images at the same exact time (as there is only one projector, alternating L+R) means the 3D effect is always slightly out of sync, meaning that without the flashing, an object moving Left to right across the screen would appear to be moving out towards you, and vice versa. The illusion would be broken.

Here's the thing. Many of the cinemas showing the HFR Hobbit release aren't capable of the 288 flashes per second required to show the film correctly, because most projectors can't do it either. So they have to show it with double flashing instead (L-R-L-R for each frame). 192 flashes per second. In these cases, you are watching out of sync 3D 25% of the time you're in that cinema screen.

So 48fps is really plenty to be catching up to for now.",0,1355643289,null,0,1355643548,0,c7hcihb,t3_14u73l,t1_c7hcihb,t1_c7ggq3e,null,1430687015,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I made him watch Blink over a year ago, and while he liked it he always said he wasn't interested in watching the whole series. Over the course of the year he saw a few clips here and there as I made my way through, but he swore up and down he wouldn't like it. 

Then a few weeks ago I made him sit down and watch the first episode of series 5. My thought process was that it would contain the least amount of backstory for me to explain. Really, the only thing I would have to fill him in on was River. Plus it has the best production value. At the end of the first episode he just looked at me, eyes wide and said ""play the next one"". I knew I had him. By the time he had caught up to the current episode he loved it and had no problem dealing with the slow parts of season 1.

No, you are ignoring the thousands of servicemen who gave their lives in war for their nation, countrymen, family and friends. You think those that fell in suicide charges over the trenches in WW1 did so because of the promise of eternal life? 

Almost any parent would ""willingly and intentionally"" sacrifice their own life if it was necessary to save their child. 

&gt; That is why the prospect of facing a foe that embraces suicide attacks willingly is so horrifying.

More so than someone who walks into a school and executes twenty 6-year-olds? If anything this is far worse, with a suicide bomb it's a single action with only one moment for backing out. 

Note also that *every* school shooter has an expectation of death. Are they also expecting ""eternal life"" for their deeds?

true,Skitrel,null,null,"No, they're anti legislation that isn't backed up by consistent evidence. Policy making should not be made on assumptions, whims, or concepts without evidence supporting the policy making backed up by meta analysis of the research.

The fact of the matter is that piracy and the effects have widely inconclusive research that shouldn't be used to create kneejerk policies.

There's, I think, a difference between pro-piracy and anti-anti-piracy. Pirate party, myself, and many redditors are anti-anti-piracy, because honestly there's never been any conclusive research to suggest piracy is bad in anyway other than that performed by agenda driven corporations with large methodology flaws in order to get the results they want. While on the other hand everyday heavy internet users see piracy having positive effects and technologies such as torrenting having perfectly legitimate uses.

Adobe for example, though they'll never admit it, owe the success and saturation of photoshop in the marketplace to piracy. As do many pieces of software. And piracy itself has spawned many good things, new ways of doing business that are better than old ways, video/movie streaming subscription sites being largely successful for example, a business type that is successful based on it being a legitimately easier and fairly cheap way for what may have been pirates otherwise to get the content they want.

The reality is, corporations will do anything to avoid innovating to solve a problem they perceive, instead they'd rather legislate away a problem caused by new tech as opposed to solving it.

We were outplayed all game, looked lethargic in every move we made, as if we really couldn't care less about the result, and deserved nothing more than a loss. The best players in blue were Ramires, Moses (God knows why he was subbed off) *(Edit: People commenting on my opinion on Moses. I thought he was always working whilst he was on compared to the others)* and especially Luiz (MOTFM) simply because they were the only players who gave a shit. 

I realise this wasn't the most important trophy of the season but we really can't be choosers when we keep getting knocked out of stuff. We've now lost the Charity Shield, Supercup and CWC, as well as getting knocked out of the CL. I fear for our game against Leeds, I really do. At this rate we'll probably kick the ball twice and let them walk all over us.

Torres has once again proven he doesn't deserve a Chelsea shirt by yet again giving an appalling performance. He had three games of trying and has now settled back down to walking and giving away the ball every time he gets a chance.

This plan requires two supermarkets. A pocket full of tissues or serviettes. A small bottle of drink. A mobile phone with camera. Once you have these you are ready to commence plan ""Saucy Attack!""

First pick two supermarkets, the one you normally shop in and some alien one preferably some distance away from your house. Armed with your items i warned you about earlier walk into the supermarket that is the longest distance away from your house.

Once inside locate the isle with the sauces. Now the biggest dilemma with sauces is you cant try before you buy. This is wrong, but in a strange supermarket and with little security, just dig in. Open bottles, jars and anything that takes your fancy. Just act quickly. Remember to drink frequently so flavours don't mix. You have tissues to gag that horrid sauces into. These will make get bombs to chuck at anyone trying to stop you on your mission. The sauces you like, take a quick snap on your camera phone for later use. 

This idea also generates a free and nutritious meal too. See its just wonderful, no need to thank me. 

Once you have tried the sauces, and possibly some jobs worth has come to move you on. Throw some of your tissues full of gooey saliva mixed with the unpleasant sauces. This is not an act of violence, you are simply showing the staff what sauces are horrible so they can refuse to stock them at a later date. Staff may not notice this at first, but will thank you later for helping them improve their stock.

Once outside proceed to your usual supermarket and shop as normal. Once at the isle with sauces, check on your camera phone for what ones you enjoyed.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Alright, basic background.

Every football club plays in a few tournaments simultaneously; there's your domestic league (the Premier League), domestic cups (FA Cup and Capitol One Cup), and for some teams who qualify, European competitions (Champions League and the Europa League). In the league, you play every other team twice, get points, and the team at the top of the table at the end of the season wins. In the domestic cups, it's a knockout tournament. In Europe, it's like the World Cup - group stages with points, then knockout rounds.

**Now, onto Liverpool.**

Historically, we were the best fucking club in the country, especially in the 70's and the 80's. In those 2 decades, we won the English top division (now the Premier League) 11 times, and the European Cup (now the Champions League) 4 times. Winning the European Cup is essentially considered the biggest prize a European club can achieve, and doing it 4 times in 2 decades is no mean feat. We won our fair share of domestic trophies as well. Until recently, we held the record of 18 English top division titles (now broken by Manchester United, our biggest rivals); but we're still the most successful English team in Europe, having won the European Cup (aka Champions League) 5 times.

There's plenty more history, but you can find out a lot about that yourself - Wikipedia covers it, as does the [official website](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history)

**Liverpool now:**

We're a long way from where we used to be :( We haven't won the English top division since 1990, and unfortunately, we haven't even challenged for it on a regular basis - the closest we've come is 2008-09, when we came 2nd. Since then, in our past 3 seasons, we've finished 7th, 6th, and 8th - well below where we should be. Also, since only the top 4 teams in England qualify for the Champions League, we haven't been in the Champions League for 3 years either. That's a big deal, because being in the Champions League earns you a *lot* of money, which lets you sign quality players. Quality players also tend to want to play for Champions League clubs. 

So, right now, our aim is to work our way back into the top 4, and only then can we start thinking about maybe challenging for a title again. Some fans are hopeful we can break into the top 4 this season, but more realistically, we should be aiming to make it back in next season.

That's a start, I'll add more in about the manager and the team when I can. Let me know if I'm rambling too much, I do that.

Mindset/Cultural aspect of what these firearms mean to a lot of people is so different to what we are use to here than unless you factor that into your debate then its just missing out an extremely important aspect making the debate somewhat pointless. The idea of ""collective safety"" (I'm sure there is probably a technical term, some call it ""nanny state"") is somewhat understood here. But to many gun owners i've spoken to personal liberty is the utmost and trumps ""collective safety"" , they accept the perceived (Its debatable) danger for the increase in personal liberty. The famous quote from Benjamin Franklin highlights this greatly I feel:

&gt;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.

You might not agree with this mindset, or fully understand it, But if you don't factor it in when thinking about this you wont get anywhere as it somewhat makes the following paragraph about statistics irrelevant. 



The above is extremely important (And i find usually missed out) And this is before you even get into the typical statistics than are usually thrown about supporting both sides. I'm no statician but these stats, Like all crime stats are usually thrown around without any context what-so ever and a complete disregard to the immense amount of factors that contribute to them. Then the argument normally falls into both sides pulling out ever increasingly impossible theoretical imaginary scenarios out of their ass like this somehow proves their side of the argument.  



I feel I'm rambling so to sum up I feel both sides of the argument, At least on Reddit, Just don't line up and will never understand each other (Making the debate a big waste of time) because there is so much to it which people disregard that its just damn near impossible to fully understand it all and factor it into your debate.

Champions league is the pinnacle of club football, it takes the top 3 or 4 from the top leagues in Europe so you can matches such as Man United (English) vs Barcelona. (Spanish) or Inter Milan (Italian) vs Bayern Munich (German) etc. This competiton runs in tandem with the league fixtures. Europa league is similar, but has worse teams and worse rewards, finish 5th/6th or win a cup competition to qualify for Europa but it's nothing special really. You can't really call the winner world champion since only EU teams are in it but EU teams are generally the strongest so i guess you could say whoever wins the CL is the best. Although that's clearly not true because Chelsea are current winners and they're far far worse than many other teams in the world.

Lionel Messi is the best player in the world. He's fucking magical. He plays in the Spanish league for Barcelona. Go youtube him. Cristiano Ronaldo is 2nd best and plays for Real Madrid in Spanish league, also an amazing player. Go look for videos on them both.

true,EJR94,lfcflame,,"Here's a guide to some of our players:

**Jose Reina**, Spanish, Goalkeeper. Known as Pepe to most fans, Reina has been a top keeper since joining 6 years ago. At 30 he's reaching his peak years and has become one of the leading goalkeepers in the league. His control on the ball and composure has led him to becoming a vital part of the way we play. He has had a bad start this season, but he's still regarded as one of the best we have had ever. He's also quite a comical guy, always playing jokes on other team mates.

**Glen Johnson**, English, Right fullback. We bought him from Portsmouth three years ago and has had his critics over the time, oftening slating his lack of defensive play. He plays more like a winger, but has shown this season he's got what it takes to defend whilst still attacking with the team. He's been rated as the best player in his position in the league this season so far.

**Martin Skrtel**, Slovakian, Centre back. Skrtel is a moving brick wall. He will tackle you and he will leave you on the floor. Him and Agger have formed a partnership which has seen them become two of the better defenders in the league. He joined 4 years ago and started to show a lot of promise

**Daniel Agger**, Danish Centre back. He is our technical defender. Good on the ball and will occasionally run forward. He is also quite strong but more often intercepts the ball rather than lunging in for a taclke. He is still quite capable in the air and can pass a ball with decent accuracy. Him and Skrtel were linked with moves away for high prices (&lt;£20m each) but both reassured fans that they were devoted to the club. Both are heavily tattoed.

**Jose Enrique**, Spanish, Left fullback. He is a strong full back who likes to attack. He joined a season and a half ago, filling a position which Liverpool have been weak in for a long time. He has also played further up the pitch this season due to a lack of attacking players at the club and has done reasonably well. His form has recently improved and has become part of our very attack minded defence.

**Lucas Leiva**, Brazilian Centre defensive midfielder. Lucas covers the back four and will apply pressure to players attempting to run at us. He marks players and intercepts a lot of passes. Initially disliked by the fans upon arrival 5 years ago, when he was quite young, as he wasn't very good. Lucas matured into a world class player eventually and was sorely missed when he was injured for the majority of last season. He got another injury this season which has seen him only just recover. He is held in high regard by almost all Liverpool fans

**Joe Allen**, Welsh, Central Midfielder. Joe Allen joined in the summer from Swansea. A recent arrival who played well in his first couple of games. Very capable passer and likes to keep the ball. He will press the opposition all game and, despite his height, will cope against physical teams. Some fans believe our manager is overworking him as in recent games he has looked tired.

**Steven Gerrard**, English, Central Midfielder. Gerrard and Liverpool are the same thing. He's a player which came out of the youth academy and has spent his whole career at the club. A few years ago he was regarded as one of the best players on the planet and has carried Liverpool for many years. Now entering his final years at the top level, Gerrard is still one of our best players. At times he looks a mere shadow of his former self, but will then launched a ball with pin point accuracy over 100 yards. He is a complete player. He can shoot, he can pass, he can run, he can tackle, he can jump. He can do almost everything. The problem now is he's aging. He can't keep up with doing everything, and he has started to show his age very much this season. In my opinion, Liverpools greatest player ever and it may only be after he retires before that is the general opinion. 

**Raheem Sterling**, English, Winger. He made his debut last season, at just seventeen years old. Due to a lack of players coming in this summer, he's had to play first team football nearly every week. Whilst it isn't ideal to rely so heavily upon him, he has risen to the challenge and caught the eye of the footballing world. Quick with both his feet and his mind, he can leave a defender scratching their head. No doubt that in a few years time he'll be up there as one of the best players in the world, but right now he's still just a kid. An exciting player to watch, but still prone to mistakes. 

**Stewart Downing**, English, Winger/Left fullback. Over a year ago we payed £20m for Stewart Downing, a price that has proven to be very excessive. He is expected to leave soon, with many fans pleased that he will be. He used to be fast and able to cross a ball perfectly. He has scored a few good goals in other competitions but nothing in the league so far. He rarely starts on the wing anymore with other players preferred there, with the manager converting him to a Left back. He has improved this season but most fans would prefer to see him go. Some of the bench players normally play over him.

**Luis Suarez**, Uruguayain(?), Striker. One of the best players in the world. Luis can make entire defences to look stupid and often takes on 4-5 players at once. Critised last season for missing many chances, this season has seen him become one of the highest scorers. He could walk into any team in the world right now. The best player at the club and possibly the best player in the league. The downside of Suarez is his temper. He gets angry quite quickly and this has led to him getting numerous yellow cards. He is also quite controversial and missed 8 games last season due to a him *suposedly* making a racial comment at a Manchester United player. 




That's our first team, its not always that and a few other players often play instead of others. Here's a few

**Brad Jones**, Australian, Goalkeeper. Our back up keeper, Jones has had to play a couple of times over the last year. It can be tough when you're not playing regularly as a goalkeeper, but Jones proved he was prepared when called upon. Good man and has never complained with the role he's been given.

**Jamie Carragher**, English, Central defender. Once the first choice Centreback, Carragher has enjoyed a career which has seen him rise through the youth to become one of our most capped players (cap=appearance for the club). He is now old and he's aged to a point where nearly everyone can outpace him. Despite the physical disadvantages, he reads the game so well he can be at the exact right place at exactly the right time. It looks as if he will be making the step up to becoming a coach and tutoring the younger Liverpool defenders.

**Martin Kelly**, English, Right/Centre back. Unfortunatly, Kelly is quite injury prone. Having back problems has hindered his playing time and has rarely played this season. Whilst playing though, he has many qualities. He's strong, quick and tall, which makes him a threat from set pieces. He can also run up and down the pitch all game long, he never looks tired. Seen as a more defensive Right back as oposed to Johnson, he still isn't bad at attacking.

**Sebastian Coates**, Uruguayian(?), Centre back. Strong and tall, Coates is a young defender who arrived after being named the best young player in South America. He doesn't play much due too him still being young but most fans believe he should be played more. He also isn't bad with his feet and scored a decent goal not too long ago

**Jordan Henderson**, English, Central Midfielder. The England U21 captain has improving this season, many fans often label him as useless. After a poor initial season, Henderson has found himself coming off the bench to try and change games recently. Many are unsure if he is worth the £16m we paid for him, but at a young age only time will tell if he's good enough for Liverpool. Personally he's my favourite player and I hope he can show the rest of our fans just what he can do.

**Jonjo Shelvey**, English, Centre attacking Midfielder. Jonjo is still a young player but has shown just what he can do in the Europa league. He's of a similar mold to Gerrard and has scored a few goals this season. He can often be rash and prefers to shoot over passing, but given enough time he'll be great. 

**Suso**, Spanish, Winger/Centre attacking midfielder. Suso is another young player who has just come out of the academy this season. He has shown great skill in getting the ball past players and has shown skills similar to Iniesta and David Silva. The ball appears to be glued to his feet at times and has been able to perfectly pass the ball on occasion. He's still young and over the next couple of years he should flourish into a top class player.

**Joe Cole**, English, Everywhere. Joe Cole. That's all you need to know. It is recommended that every Liverpool fan have a poster of him above where they sleep, to which you pray infront of for 5 minutes before every game.


There are a couple more players that I'm sure other people will tell you about, but those are the ones that mostly player for us.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; why did we go from 2nd to 6th, 7th and 8th that seems like a big drop

At the time that we came 2nd, our club's American owners, Hicks &amp; Gillette, were dragging the club into a financial mess - they took out loans to buy the club in the first place, and tried to repay these loans using revenue from the club; money we would otherwise have spent on players. So really, coming 2nd was a huge achievement that happened despite our financial situation - but eventually, the financial situation began to catch up on us.

At the same time that we declined, two other teams, Man City and Tottenham (aka Spurs), began to challenge for the top 4 - Spurs by spending a lot of money and sacking an underperforming manager, and City by spending even more money - I'm talking a huge fuckton of money, after being bought by rich Arab owners. So that also answers your question about why is getting into the top 4 so hard - because whereas earlier there was usually only 4 teams challenging for it - Man United, Arsenal, us, and Chelsea - now there's also Tottenham and Man City, while a couple of other teams, Newcastle and Everton (our local rivals) have upped their game and tried to challenge for it as well.

Also, there was a lot of instability on the managerial front - the manager who got us to 2nd, Rafa Benitez, was embroiled in political arguments with the owners about the damage they were doing to the club; when he finished 7th the next season, they had their excuse to sack him. His replacement, Roy Hodgson, wasn't good enough, and was sacked half a season into the job with Liverpool sitting 12th. He was replaced by club legend 'King' Kenny Dalglish - the best ever player for Liverpool, and former manager, the last person to win the league title with Liverpool. His first six months were great, as he lifted us from 12th to 6th - by now we also had new owners, current American owners FSG, who wiped out our major debt problems. But last season, he made bad decisions in buying players, overspending on players who weren't good enough or weren't ready for Liverpool or both. That, and a lot of bad shooting, meant we bossed games without scoring, and ended up in 8th, despite having spent almost 100m on new players. Because of that, FSG sacked him, even though many fans would have liked to see him get another season at least to make things right.

&gt; the champions league is a tournament right? so is the winner like the best in the world? and are the winners called world champions like in some american sports?

Not the best in the world, but the best in Europe. But really, for some people that's synonymous with being the best in the world - the only other continent where the football is of comparable quality to Europe is South America. You're not called world champions, but you are European Champions.

&gt; who is liverpools best player and who is the best player in the world?

Luis Suarez, our striker. He's a very inventive and creative striker, very hard-working, scores some brilliant goals and is tricky as hell with the ball at his feet. The only criticism of him is that he can be very wasteful as well, and often misses some easy goalscoring chances. 

(Steven Gerrard, our captain and midfielder, used to be our best but he's getting older so he's not as good as he used to be.)

The best in the world is Leo Messi, who is of a similar style to Suarez but, well, better. :P He's definitely not wasteful in front of goal, as well. 

&gt; I think the manager is from spain but not sure.

Our former manager Rafa Benitez was Spanish. Our current manager is Brendan Rodgers, and he's from Nor'n Ireland. He's young (only 39), and was hired to replace Kenny Dalglish after he led newly promoted Swansea to 11th in the Premier League last season while playing some beautiful passing football similar to that of Barcelona (regarded as one of, if not **the**, best teams in the world).

&gt; does everybody on the liverpool page know each other, everybody talks like they are friends

I don't know any of these sorry bastards in real life :P But we're nice to each other because, well, if we don't have each other, then what do we have, really? :P

&gt; is it ok to call it soccer or is football insisted?

UEFA Champions League (CL) is considered the best club football tournament mainly because it allows some of the highest profile teams in Europe to have a crack at one another. And as a continent - wide tournament you can imagine the amount of loyalties and attention that kind of thing can receive.

Current manager is Brendan Rodgers, you're thinking of Rafa Benitez he was manager from 2004-2010.

true,inquisitivinatorer,lfc99,,"why did we go from 2nd to 6th, 7th and 8th that seems like a big drop:

The main reason being the previous owners Hicks &amp; Gillette, they almost bankrupt the club through major mismanagement and they were forced to sell the club on the day we would have been put into administration. As they were managing the club poorly, we were forced to sell players in order to buy players we needed for certain positions which meant that we couldn't afford to keep a decent, settled squad. Since the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group we have had to do a lot of rebuilding throughout the whole team from sponsorships, playing staff and backroom staff. Although the new owners are a lot better (under exaggeration) than the previous owners, there have been a few mistakes on their part which that have admitted too which has caused their plans to go a little slower than they would have liked. 

All of this has lead to us declining in our yearly league position, but we are seemingly back on the up. Hopefully the owners will support the manager and give him money in January to buy some players to improve the squad. 

 the champions league is a tournament right? so is the winner like the best in the world? and are the winners called world champions like in some american sports?

The Champions League (European Cup) is a tournament, but as it only includes European teams you can't really say the team is the best in the world, although the tournament is regarded as the highest prize in club football. When a team wins the Champs League they get to play against teams in a tournament called the Club World Cup which is usually played in Asia against all the other winners of the tournaments equivalent to the Champs League from the different continents, but this trophy isn't held in as high esteem with European teams. 

why is getting in the top 4 so hard?

It is so hard simply because other than winning the league. that is the main goal for every team in the league every year. Teams that are in the Champions League, (which is achieved by getting top 4), earn a lot of money just for entering the tournament which leads on to that team being able to afford better players and attract them with the chance of playing in the tournament. Every year that a team is out of the Champions League is another year of being disadvantaged in terms of the players and money available to you, unless you can get a 'sugar daddy' owner such as Chelsea and more recently Man City. 

 who is liverpools best player and who is the best player in the world?

Currently, Liverpools best player is Luis Suarez, but there are other notable players such as Steven Gerrard, who is (in my opinion at least) Liverpools biggest legend, Lucas Leiva and Daniel Agger. The topic of best player in the world is sort of a hot topic right now, in my opinion it is Lionel Messi of Barcelona but a lot of people would say Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid. 

I think the manager is from spain but not sure.

Our current manager is Brendan Rodgers, a Northern Irishman that we got him from a team called Swansea from Wales. 

does everybody on the liverpool page know each other, everybody talks like they are friends.

I don't know about this as this is one of my first posts on this board I think so maybe someone else can answer? 

is it ok to call it soccer or is football insisted?

In England at least it is called football, but you can call it what you want, either way people will know what you are talking about. 

I hope this helps, if you have any more questions please feel free to ask. If anyone else has something to say regarding any of the things that I have said then I will be interested to hear what you have to say.

true,sickgrof,num10-away,,"I usually write out my own, but there's already a few so I guess I'll just put it in here...

1) Super Jan back centrally...clean sheet and he scores...not a coincidence

2) Said it in the match thread...Defoe was piss poor today...if he was in his form from 2 weeks ago, he has a hat trick today, easy

3) I think we actually looked much better when we only had one striker up top

4) Townsend was a tremendous sub...led to the only goal...talk about a blessing in disguise

5) Thought Dembele was great today, but just a little bit off his typical form...lost a few balls in possession that he normally wouldn't

6) We really need to figure out our defense/goalkeeper communication problems...Gallas headed out a ball in the 93rd minute for a corner that was basically in Hugo's chest

7) If I was in the net and Walker kicked a ball at me, I'd probably shit my pants

8) Lennon needs to continue working on his abilities in the box...had at least 2 chances to put one in today...not the best finisher

9) Hugo comes off his line as well as any keeper in the world...pure brilliance from him

The academy is where Liverpool get the next up and coming players. Some players join very young (at 8-9 years old, they are mostly kids who are local to the area and don't have to move) and they are trained by Liverpools Academy staff. You play in U20 (under 20 years old) games against other teams academies. I believe they still attend normal schools. They aren't graded as such, but if they perform well enough they'll get called up to the first team squad. When they get to play first team football, its their chance to show the manager what they can do. Football is a team sport but an individual can easily stand out. Sterling has been held in high regard since he joined the academy at 15 from Queens park Rangers. He made his debut last season against Wigan, coming off the bench for the last couple of minutes. He has come fully out of the academy and is part of the first team squad fully now, it is rare for a player to do this before they're 20 and only top quality players do this. 

It doesn't mean that you have to leave the academy early to become a great first team player, as different players mature at different rates. It isn't a good idea to play a young player against much older and physically stronger oppenents as it may results in an injury to the player.

Out of all the academies, Liverpools is regarded as one of the best in the world which was shown as our U20 performed very well against other European U20 teams in the NextGen competition.

A defensive midfielder is someone who plays in the middle of the pitch, behind the centre mids and infront of the defence.

Or when I was in hospital recovering from a broken skull, having had the shit kicked out of me coming out of a night club.

Or perhaps the time I had to go through an ugly disciplinary procedure at a previous job, because a Muslim colleague tried to have me fired, for having a picture of my boyfriend as my PC desktop. And then alleged that I and the company were acting in a discriminatory, and racist manner, when it didn't happen.

&gt;""What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead.

&gt;This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs – to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.

&gt;In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and re-inscribed exactly as often as was necessary.""

true,victor_foxtrot,lfc99,,"&gt; whats a defencive midfielder

Also called a ""holder"" or ""holding midfielder"", a defensive mid serves a number of purposes:

* serves as the link between the defenders and the midfielders higher up the pitch
* covers for defenders that have strayed out of position
* receives back passes from central midfielders to recycle/maintain possession of the ball
* makes tackles and intercepts passes in the area just prior to the final third of our own side of the field
* Etc.

The Lucas Leiva cat that EJR mentions above is one of the finest holding midfielders in the world.  His presence significantly settles the team defensively and also allows other midfielders to take on other roles they're more suited for - almost like how in baseball when a closer returns to a team's bullpen after injury, it not only locks down the 9th inning much more effectively but also allows the other relievers to take on roles further down the long.

The Champions League is the most prestigious soccer competition in the world - players who are in it aren't going to want to get out of it, and players that aren't in it want to play for teams that are in it.  This is a big reason why it'd be beyond massive for LFC to finish in the top 4 of the premier league.

&gt; is the spanish league the best in the world?

You can argue Premier League vs La Liga until you're blue in the face, but I think most people would rate the PL ahead of La Liga.  Spain's two best teams (Real Madrid and Barcelona) are pretty materially better than any teams in England, but La Liga is incredibly top-heavy.  The PL is much deeper.

It's also not like Henry doesn't have money to spend on the team - when he bought the club he splashed out a good amount of money on players, they just made some bad decisions on who to buy.",0,1355675735,null,0,false,0,c7hgk4t,t3_14xvuy,t1_c7hgk4t,t1_c7hgdkc,null,1430688912,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

But: ""My advice is as follows - stop listening to the media portrayal of the Jobcentre on the news//We're here to help you"". No. It's not from a portrayal anywhere that we form our opinions, it's from experience dealing with what is possibly the most shambolic of large organisations in the country.

I've never come across an organisation that knows less about what it's actually doing, and from there I think a lot of the frustration stems.

Ba - Good player, but I don't think Alan Pardew will let him go, with Cisse not showing his brilliant performances that he did show last season. Even if he does decide to leave, I (for some reason) just don't see him coming to Liverpool. 

Huntelaar - I really want him to come, but it seems like a lot of transfer talk of him coming has died down, and moved to Sturridge. I don't think he would be all that expensive, and he's a phenomenal player that will give us a few good years. Apparently Inter are after him as well now...

Gaius: When there's been something like 3 separate sources/prophesies on how Mordred is going to be Arthur's downfall, you're seriously saying ""nah dude, it's chill they're bros."" Like seriously? You know who else was pretty loyal and loved Arthur? Morgana.

Merlin: Yeah, really? You're going to try to keep Mordred from killing Arthur by keeping Cara alive? If he keeps Cara alive, fine Mordred won't be betrayed. But remember how Cara tried to kill Arthur? That wasn't just a ""oh yeah I'm young and dumb"" thing. You know what else keeps Mordred from killing Arthur? Killing Mordred. Merlin is completely illogical on this Mordred plotline.

Mordred: So basically we're meant to think ""Oh he loves this girl, this is why he's being crazy."" But crazy enough to forget/forgive that a girl he hasn't seen in years just tried to kill his best friend and king? Also crazy enough to sort of just wave it off when she kills a guard in cold blood and then tells him to kill his friends?

Because previously when people came to Britain, they learned the language and added our culture to theirs and contributed theirs to ours.

Fast forward to today. There is a guy on BBC News on a story about immigration saying his mother came to the UK 50 years ago yet still can't speak english, councils and public services produce literature and signage in several languages and in the last several years you have certain muslim groups demanding Sharia courts and a separate parliament. In short they're not interested in learning our language and want to force their culture on to ours to the point that they basically want to set up a little bit of the shithole country they came from in ours complete with their own set of rules and laws that superceed those of the UK.

To put it differently, while my evidence is anecdotal, i think your video is as bad if not worse, and your own comment proves it, let me explain why.

Is it your assertion that no cyclist ever jumps a red light? and that most cars do at every red light? If the answer is yes, then you are an idiot and there is no point discussing with you further.

If not then the only assumption can be that there is something wrong with your data.

1. The kind of cyclist who is going to have a helmet cam to prove that cyclists don't jump red lights is not likely to be the same kind of cyclist who jumps red lights.

2. Where in that video were all the times cars didn't jump red lights (unless you claim that is as rare as that video implies)

That is a video specifically compiled to make the point you are making, and this is precisely why it fails to do so.

Have I denied cars jump red lights? No.

Cars as ""Amber gamblers"" seems to be pretty standard at the moment, and should end. 

However, I have never heard people defend those car drivers that do jump red lights anywhere near as much as I have heard cyclist defend cyclists who do in this thread. ""I am turning left its fine"" ""It is less likely to kill people its fine"".

In my experience (and I will repeat, cyclists seem the behave better in cities and more cycle friendly places  - possibly because they are accommodated to better -  I live in a working class town) a cyclists attitude to a red light is similar to that of a driver to the speed limit on the motorway. ""It is okay because..."" 

I know several shit drivers (I am of the opinion that 90% of the population should have their licence removed, the expectation of being able to drive has lowered the standard of driving well beyond what it should be), the kind of drivers that do 50mph IN TOWN, the kind that don't indicate at all (something else that pisses me off) yet they all stop for a red light if they see one, even if there is no real reason for a light to be red.

Suarez makes up the majority of our attacking threat, he also provides the majority of the goals, the majority of the assists and creates the majority of our chances and some games he does more running then the team combined. 

He's the type of player you build teams around, right now we have good players but they struggle trying to keep up with him, prime example was against villa when he out of nowhere gifted shelvey a chance and it caught him by surprise, or that through ball to Gerrard, or that pass through to sterling and that was just the first 15 minutes..

the reason F, M and R score consistently other than being very good goal scorers is because they have a team of players around them that can perform and work at a level similar to them and they know the players around them should know what there capable of. Many times ive heard people on this subreddit complain that Suarez is selfish but lets be honest the amount of times he gifts opportunities to players that they blow or when he's in a goal scoring opportunity and the other players dont pass it, no wonder he's frustrated and keeps it and so he should. 

surround him with players that dont need a second chance and watch him flourish.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The British political system was based around the idea of Labour vs Tory + a 3rd party one can place protest votes with. The LibDems used to fill that spaces by managing to campaign as an alternative to Labour in some areas, and an alternative to the Tories in others. Which was fine when they were 3rd, but a strategy that fell apart the second they had to ""choose"" which side of the coin they would come down on, thus actually making their position clear. So now the UK needs a new protest party,  and this is why both the greens and UKIP are making progress, but neither have the same universal appeal which attracts voters from both sides of the political spectrum.

The situation is also compounded by the fact that both the Tories and Labour have figured out that the UK is primarily interested in a very narrow band of political ideology, a centrist platform of free market economics + welfare state in a socially liberal culture, and are mostly going after this vote (but from different starting points). This opens up the floor to people with less centrist views as they no longer feel they can support Labour or the Tories due to being to left or right, and look for parties with more defined policies.

And finally, immigration is a real issue to a lot of people in the UK. Not because they are racists who hate foreigners, but because there are genuine issues with multiculturalism. 

A very general overview, but I would expect the UKIP vote to drop back down once Labour and the Tories take stronger stances on alternatives to multiculturalism (which they are starting to do). And I expect the LibDems to lose support, and instead of a 3rd protest party there will be loads of them, some national and some regional.

You can go through lights on amber *if* you do not have time to stop. 

This has in recent times turned into you can go through on amber if you can get there in time, which has lead to drivers putting their foot down to get to the light on amber, failing and ending up going through on red. Again I will say **This is wrong and I am not defending it, just explaining my categorising**. 

This is what I am calling an amber gambler they are gambling they can get through on amber, and end up going through on red when they lost that gamble. You will notice in most of those (assuming there was a vehicle behind them) it would actually have also been dangerous for them to stop by the point the light turns red because the speed they had built up would have prevented them doing so reasonably **again, still wrong just explaining**

So you have all the ones going though on amber, with one or two (or three or four) on red tagging on. **Again, they shouldn't**

The incident at 1.48 is precisely what I am talking about. That light had been red for long enough for him to know full well he was going to hit it on red. There was clearly nothing behind him for him to worry about hitting him. And most importantly, traffic which was on green at the time could quite easily be moving (there is a delay between one light turning red and another turning green, on most of the other incidents, they probably weren't going through when other traffic was moving - again doesn't make it okay, just pointing out why I would put most of those incidents at tagging on)

In the video I posted, everyone except that single bike stopped for that red, there was no pushing the edge, that was just blatantly ignoring (or missing). These are the incidents that I see bikes doing relatively often compared to cars.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Depends on your tastes, there are two basic types of bean, robusta and arabica ([actually more](http://coffee-ucc.com/en/about_coffee/coffee_types/), but these are the most common), normally for most people, you want a blend which is high in arabica content, or 100% arabica.  Arabica is more mild and aromatic, robusta is strong and bitter.  Personally, I like some robusta, but most people don't want too much (although a lot of it ends up in instant coffee, which is one reason ""proper"" coffee tastes better).  Producer countries have some unique characteristics, with different blends and different beans from different geographical regions which vary in quality and taste.  Coffee is actually quite a picky plant, and only really grows well in certain micro-climates, and at certain elevations (think grapes).  In fact, the variety and complexity of taste in coffee is every bit as diverse as tea, wine, beer, cheese, etc.

Aside from country, region, proportion of arabica (and obviously things like processing quality), there are a few other factors like roasting time which have a significant impact on flavour - longer roasting times mean stronger flavour, shorter times mean milder more delicate flavour.  This is normally expressed as ""dark"" or ""long"" roasted.

The biggest producer countries are [Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_production), and all of these produce some excellent beans/coffees. In fact, I live in Vietnam (which mostly produces robusta), and some of the local coffee is astonishingly good (there are also some very odd coffees where the beans have to first be eaten and partly digested by civet cats, but I don't recommend these!)   Indonesia, for example, is quite famous for it's strong early-morning-kick-starting Java coffees.  However, the smaller producer countries also produce some great coffees - perhaps the most famous in the world of which is Jamaican Blue Mountain, which only grows in a very small geographical area, and is consequently pretty expensive.  Personally, I find it too perfume-y and delicate flavoured, but it is to coffee like champagne is to wine or Darjeeling is to tea.

I now have 80Mbit/s VDSL2 (connects at only 71Mbit unfortunately) and it's fine.

&gt; We are such a tiny island it should be a very fast process to get high speed internet to almost everyone and yet we are decades away from that....its a fucking disgrace.

The size of the island is irrelevant. It's all about how the population is spread out, and it's incredibly expensive to roll out services to rural areas. For ADSL it has been easier because all you have to do is plonk a (fairly cheap for a company like BT) DSLAM in the exchange and connect it to a network. ADSL however has distance limits and it's not great for everyone.

Anything better requires a lot more thinking and investment. If you are the only house for miles around BT is not going to pay the tens of thousands to give you FTTC or FTTP, and I would suspect if BT were nationalised it'd do the same (it'd still be a for profit enterprise that thinks about return on investment, just that the profits go to the state. Like Network Rail or Royal Mail or the Ordnance Survey or the Met Office. The main rail line down here is shit, despite the state involvement).

true,CTypo,silence,Silence,"**Spoilers ahead :)**

There are two routes you could go. You could have them start with Rose and just watch in in linear order, or if you want to ease them into it, have them watch various episodes that don't really develop anything plot related. If it's an episode with very little necessary backstory and very little plot development, it's a good episode to ease them into it. The episodes in which the Doctor is without a companion are good in this area.

1. Rose. I said it before but it's still good. It's the start of the series, it doesn't assume you know anything, and it teaches you as you go along with Rose. It's a very good starting point IMO, if you can get past the complete difference between 9th and 10th/11th.

2. The Eleventh Hour. Suggested by many people here, this is also a good point to start at. The Doctor meets Amy for the first time as a child. Very good episode.

3. Midnight. This one's definitely freaky, but the Doctor is away from Donna for pretty much all of it and is doing his own adventures. He's alone so it's assumed that nobody around him knows anything about him, therefore he's not going to talk about much we won't understand. Other than Rose appearing on the television screen and the names he speaks to the repeating creature there isn't much unexplained backstory in this episode.

4. The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe. The Doctor's alone again, it's a Christmas special, lots of the mystery is explained to the children like...well, they're children, so it's easy to take in. It might get weird near the end with the sudden time vortex and all that, but it really doesn't make much more sense as a seasoned Whovian anyways so that's okay. You may wanna cut off the episode at the last five minutes after everyone is reunited though. Right before he goes upstairs to the TARDIS. Spoilers are after that and it ends happily anyways. 

4. A Christmas Carol. Familiar story with a sci-fi/Doctor twist. Amy and Rory don't play too big a part in this one. The Doctor plays a time travelling guardian angel which I think was explained all by itself fairly well.

5. Planet of the Dead. A Tennant episode where he's alone, shortly before ""The End of Time"". This is the one where he goes on the bus with the jewel thief. New (temporary) companion, all new characters, and new adventures. The only group with any backstory is UNIT and they don't need much explaining as there are no reoccurring characters.

7. The Lodger. This episode was just completely awesome. Another episode where Amy doesn't exactly have a large role, so it's easy to explain what's going on here. Craig is awesome and the Doctor is hilarious in here. It has a small sci-fi twist but most of this one is just interactions between the characters, which is great for easing someone into the show. You might have to explain some parts of this one with your friend but it won't be that much.

8. Closing Time. The second Craig episode. Another one to cut off the ending at the very end after the climax of the story, because it starts delving into spoilers/preparations for the following episode. But other than that and explaining what a Cyberman is, I think this is a great episode. It helps bring the person into the world of the Doctor before exposing them to *too much* of the strange alien-infested world.

However, when drivers talk about you as a group running red lights that incident is precisely what they are talking about.

true,CandleJakk,null,null,"Look at it this way: Arshavin's career at Arsenal is over given they have one of the strongest midfield's in the league - and he is still a pretty good player when he gets regular action, couple that with his Premier League experience, and striking ability, he could prove to prove to be a huge asset to our team - and he wouldn't have the pressure of being compared to Arteta, Cazorla, Wilshere, Ramsey, Walcott and AOC.

We've got enough depth in our forward play that we could play a 4-5-1/4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3 and switch easily enough between the two and a 4-4-2 without much difficulty.

           --------McCarthy---------
     Shorey---Pearce---Morrison---Gunter
           Karacan ----- Leigertwood
     Kebé ------- Guthrie ------- McAnuff
                   Alfie

Take the above, for example. You could easily enough switch out Guthrie for Alfie and Alfie for anyone of our other strikers. I reckon Pogrebnyak works better as a lone striker. Alfie &amp; Hunt would have plenty of support for their runs behind the defense. Roberts, like Pavel could muscle through most defenses easy enough. Similar to MUFC, playing a second striker in a high(ish) CAM position can yield some great results, if they're switched on enough, like Rooney &amp; RVP.

If you want to keep Guthrie on for his experience, switch him into Leigertwood's place, and (hypothetically) slot Arshavin into the CAM role, or HRK. We user our wing play well as it is, but I think it over streches our defensive midfield, and exposes a sometimes clumsy and inexperienced back four.

If you got with a 433, you could field:

        ---------McCarthy--------
    Shorey -- Pearce -- Morrison -- Gunter
      Kebé --- Arshavin/Guthrie --- McAnuff
         Hunt --- Pogrebnyak --- HRK/McCleary

This is again useful enough to divert to a similar 4231 I showed earlier, or our standard 442 in either a flat or diamond format.

Certainly, our defense is the first thing that needs bolstering, and Federici's confidence to come back, but someone with Arshavin's ability and experience shouldn't be underestimated or seen as a bad thing - should we pursue him fully.

I'm not SO left wing. A point I often make when people start complaining how /r/uk is a Trotskyist circlejerk or whatever, is that /r/uk isn't left wing. The political spectrum is all to the right. The Labour party is to the right. It appears to me that people whom I consider far-right are imagining the Labour party to be on the left. They aren't. I am. But I don't think I'm far left. I'm pretty sure there are many further left people than me. But they aren't on /r/uk because everyone on /r/uk is on the right except for me and a couple of other commenters. 

You just think that /r/uk is saturated with lefties because you think that anyone who reads the Grauniad or supports Labour is a leftist. 

Everyone to the left of George Osbourne is not a leftist. 

I'm sorry I don't know how to say this in a succinct way, your political calibration is squiffy. You centre is very right. Your left is moderately right. Your right is far right. I think that applies to a lot of people.

The education system does not educate and the media does not inform. You are experiencing  a delusion of sorts. I am as well but it's different so I can see some stuff you can't yet.  

&gt;banging on about how capitalism is bad and deluded into thinking people will work anyway if money wasnt a thing...

Of course people will do stuff if money wasn't a thing. How do you think anyone did stuff before money was invented. You are aware it's an invention, right? 

Money makes people do stuff they don't want to do. Whether by design or convenient accident, money has allowed a small group of people to coerce everyone else into doing something shit &amp; pointless that they don't want to do. Without money we'd do stuff that was important to us. I'd still be doing what I am now plus some gardening and helping remove the rubbish and look after the elderly or something. 

Money forces destitute Africans to mine for shit to make mobile phones with or starve or be shot or otherwise abused so that we, the privileged, can enjoy cheap technology. 

Here's something to imagine - lets assume that EVERYONE was more or less happy doing whatever their job is now. Let's assume it gives them enough satisfaction that they would do it just because it's good and worthwhile. 

Now remove money from the equation, what happens? 

Now imagine 80% of the workforce hated what they do for a job. Now remove money. How would you get the rubbish removed? How would you mine for shit? Would you volunteer? 

Are you happy knowing that people remove the rubbish and work in mines because we accept a system which coerces them with the threat of destitution and starvation? 

&gt;I just wanna understand why, because theres a few of you here who share the same utterly bizarre fundamental belief systems, thats why i'd enjoy it if you did an AMA.

That's great. I am not the person to do an AMA. There are many others who would do better at explaining stuff. But you can also look at http://www.reddit.com/r/anarchy101 which has some very good starter material. 

This essay was very strong for me when I was a kid:

Other stuff that got me thinking about the general nature of the reality in which we find ourselves and why we think what we do include the writings of Robert Pirsig, Philip K Dick, Doris Lessing and Kurt Vonnegut. 

Ummm, watch the Adam Curtis stuff (east to find on Youtube) if you're not the reader. Look for End:Civ if you need a quick pick-me-up. Umm even David Icke is good, although he's a total lunatic.

Actually, sometimes they are and I *have* got my MP involved.

The last time I was unemployed I did not have suitable interview clothing as my previous employment was a casual dress office. 

I considered that as the Advisor's Discretionary Fund was there to remove barriers to employment, it would be reasonable to ask for assistance towards the cost of buying a suit to wear to interviews as nobody would take me seriously if I rocked up wearing jeans and a tshirt.

My advisor in the Job Centre flat out refused to even discuss the ADF with me and told me that it was only there to help AFTER employment was secured and if you needed help with - for example - a bus pass. This was complete bullshit and the utter opposite of what was on the Job Centre and DWP websites, but the advisor refused to even discuss it with me and when I appealed to the centre manager I received a written reply full of factual inaccuracies.

I went along to my MP's surgery and asked him to write to the DWP regarding the issue and surprise surprise - the centre manager had ""re-examined my case"" and discovered that they had indeed misadvised me and had stated some factual inaccuracies in the response they gave me.

I went back in and met with another advisor who re-assessed me for the ADF, found that I was indeed entitled to assistance and reimbursed me £150 towards my suit and shoes.

I accept that the OP might personally be doing a good job, but when some of their colleagues flat out lie to customers because they can't be arsed doing their job then it really doesn't help the public perception of the Job Centre.",0,1355698222,null,0,false,0,c7hmkpr,t3_14x0t8,t1_c7hmkpr,t3_14x0t8,null,1430691818,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,entinthemountains,lfc12,,"I went to a boarding school in the US (college prep not for discipline, as an alternative to crappy public schools). I had roommates from all over the globe, but one in particular was (at the time) a member of a Spanish Primera Liga youth team...kid was amazing and All-state first team central mid in soccer. 

Eventually we discussed as an American I don't know much about soccer but wanted to learn more. He said, you gotta have a team!! So my selection process started. I remember reading an ESPN soccernet story about picking an English team, and drew inspiration from that...

So in 2006, I picked Liverpool after months of reading about clubs and players...I didn't want to be a bandwagonner. I didn't want to pick the best just because they are the best and I know no history. I liked that Liverpool was a team who historically were good, and the players had passion, and the supporters were the envy of the league (for cheers and songs). The stadium was good and old, not new and flashy. Thoughts about Liverpool just stated to feel right. 

So for the 2006-2007 season, I became a Liverpool fan, and was overjoyed when we got to the champs league final. I felt like a fan when I got goosebumps and tears in the same match. 

Since that fateful season, I've met Liverpudlians in college who I've watched matches with, but never been to the stadium, just cheered the Reds from thousands of miles away. I've watched the team get dangerously close in those fine gray uniforms to win the league in 2009, and nearly lose the plot last season. Throughout it all, to the beat of YNWA I have been marching.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're absolutely right, and a big part of why Starbucks entered **voluntary** negotiations with HM Revenue and Customs was because the writing would be on the wall at the next re-tooling of statute.

In Starbucks' case, the issue was relatively easy to 'fix' with legislation. This is principally because the goods (coffee, etc) are bought in the UK. 

The problem comes with online entities such as Amazon, or Google. Because the transaction is, legally speaking, a payment to a foreign-based company, it becomes incredibly difficult to legally close the loophole without interfering with other valid decisions. 

In fact it becomes even harder due to a very old (19th century) treaty which the UK agrees with other signatories not to tax payments in another jurisdiction. Even though Amazon has a huge operation in the UK, because the payment is made to a foreign branch of the firm, any attempt to tax the money at that point would fall foul of the treaty. A problem with applying commercial tax policy designed in a pre-internet world to modern circumstances. 

The easiest remedy for the UK is some circumstances is to levy a duty on the goods, but that would result in a price markup for the consumer, and would not be possible against other EU member states. 

Another remedy would be to require that sales within the UK are attached to a UK company. This would be possible to a degree, but would mean that a lot of companies that do pay tax fairly would choose not to operate in the UK at all.

When I heard about Saturday's event in which members joined hands and prayed, I shook my head in disbelief.  Is this all the middle class can manage?  Yes.  Why?  Because it's middle and working-class, non-affiliated citizens who wish it will go away yet not engage in motivating whoever is in power to reform how people are educated on our history, whether they deem it important or not.  In our schools, we're taught about WWII, Vietnam, the early settlements of Vikings, there's nothing about the United Irishmen, The Fenian Brotherhood, the origins of the UVF, none of it.  The elephant in the fucking room is EDUCATION.  We need to let people know, that if they choose an affiliation, they have to know the full story of either side, and maybe they'll then see why such madness that has occurred is pointless and without due reason.

God forbid we have an educated working class who can think for themselves and finally establish that Stormont is nothing short of being an ouroboros, designed to keep our representatives in the money and make it look like they're doing something.  They are happy to see N.I. cough and splutter until it turns yellow on its deathbed and rots away.  West Belfast is 9th highest in the UK for unemployment.  East Belfast is covered in cardboard shop fronts with painted pictures to make it look like there is business.  There's nothing.  The likes of the Newtownards road is dead.  Working class problems are jobs, housing, benefits, education, drugs, alcohol abuse, neglectful parents, I have lived amongst it and seen the lot.  The issue about the flag should be on the back burner, not the fucking forefront, and the council members shouldn't be pushing this agenda.

Our approach to violence now is to simply take it, hide indoors, and hope it goes away.  One person on Sunday's protest, had a sign saying he was standing with the brave of Belfast.  Brave?  A Sunday morning with the shops closed, police nearby, and a crowd of 1000, in a city center, with little to no chance of bloodshed occurring.  Brave?  Really?

To quote the BBC:"" On Sunday, a bigger crowd clapped, cheered, blew horns and banged drums for five minutes.

They said they were making ""a big noise"" to call for an end to violence.""

If our approach to contesting what is wrong with this region is to rant and rave and do the equivalent of a street party, then of course nothing will change.

On Meddle is the song ""Fearless."" It is a great song and it features the KOP singing YNWA at various points, and its prominent at the end. 

The energy from whatever crowd was singing whatever they were singing was so incredible that I had to look it up because I wanted to be a part of that. To be that.

So, I looked it up and that was it. Wasn't even a fan of football before that.

I have since saved money and made the trip to Anfield this past October from the US and saw them win 1-0 vs Reading. I also saw a few other matches there and played the song Fearless on my Ipod during halftime at one of the games, while standing and staring out. Needless to say, one of the best moments of my young life (I'm 23).

TL;DR : Pink Floyd song Fearless features KOP singing YNWA, the energy of which led me to LFC.

I did as told and was amazed by the skill and speed he showed, particularly a move involving poking the ball between two players and running around them to get in the oppositions box. 

I started to watch more and came to idolise Becks, who was good at what I was good at; Crossing, long distance passing, and generally set pieces. I followed him and united for two seasons, until becks left and went to real. The thing was I didn't care for the rest of the team really and my hero moved on. It was at this point that my best friend, a Huge liverpool fan, convinced me to watch some games with him. 

In no time I began following them and always made time to watch the games.

So when you go to the store to buy batteries, just get whatever is cheapest with the exception of heavy duties. Also I would stay away from buying batteries from smaller places as there is a good chance their batteries are old and may have lost a good amount of their juice.

Another interesting fact; Rayovac Infinity Gold and Ultra Pro are the exact same batteries as a normal Rayovac alkaline. The Ultra Pros are marketed more for Industrial use.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A bunch of friends and I played on the same U10 soccer team in 2002, right around the same time as the WC. We all got these WC sticker books and a few packs of stickers and from there we all picked our favourite teams based on family ancestry or whatever reason (this is in Canada where soccer isn't as popular). I picked England, because they were a relatively big team like the others and none of my other friends liked them so they became my go-to national team. Michael Owen became my ""favourite player"" because he seemed pretty good and Beckham was too mainstream, and Owen played for Liverpool at the time so I chose them as my club team, and from there I bought some merch over the years (Steve Gerrard jersey keychain etc.) and I found it pretty cool that they won the CL in 05. My dad likes most sports and he would turn on EPL most Saturday mornings, and he always knew I was a Liverpool fan so I got a shirt for xmas in 07 (the white away with the green Carlsberg logo). I only knew a few players around that time, mainly Gerrard, Torres, and Reina. Wore the jersey more and more over the years, but my main interactions with watching soccer were mainly England games at the WC.

Fast forward to last season where I started getting into it more on Saturday mornings before Hockey Night in Canada was on, wearing my Liverpool toque every day. I had always loved Gerrard and considered him to be my favourite (the Owen love was relatively short-lived ;) ), but I really started to enjoy Luis Suarez. One of my friends that I met last year in uni was a big soccer fan so we'd talk about it alot even though he was a Chelsea fan. 

Then this past May,  my cousin takes me out to the bar with his wife and one his friends to watch the FA Cup, and it was quite honestly my first time watching a full LFC game. The bar was 90% Reds and it was really an amazing experience getting drunk at 11Am with a bunch of rowdy Liverpool fans. The 'Fuck Off Chelsea FC' chant even made its rounds at the table next to us. I loved it, I was hooked.

i got into footy more over the summer with Euro and all, and then BOOM NHL LOCKOUT, and i was already prepared to sell my soul to Liverpool FC. I'm in love with the sport and the team. I think I'm in for good.

Abbey has not had anywhere near enough development yet to make anyone give a shit about her, so they should take as much opportunity as they can to develop her character, yet they decided to make this primarily a Rudy episode.

To that end, I felt nothing when Nun-girl died, because she was barely in 3 episodes. Aside from that, Rudy has, and will always be a joke character, a Nathan replacement, and so I can't take him seriously. It was nothing like the impact last season's finale had on me when Alisha was killed, because I knew Simon's grief was real.

I'm not criticising the actor who plays Rudy because I think he's great at playing the part written for him, but he's a joke character, in there for the humour, and serious storylines for him that are shoehorned into barely 2 episodes just seem out of place and aren't going to make me reconsider that opinion.

Aside from that, Alex needed to die and stay dead. Related: The fact that they got Nikki's cause of death mixed up in the wrong timeline means these writers really don't know what they're doing. I love one poster in these comments trying to justify it with the ""unreliable narrator"" excuse, but it's just lazy research. Hell, actors don't even watch the shows they're in; do you think writers do?

I was expecting some big reveal in either the four horsemen being four characters we know, or the probation worker having a power and becoming the fifth Misfit. Anyone but Alex...

All in all, congrats E4.

I personally don't think we can justify NOT keeping our scanners running 7/7 - they cost millions of £ and we have robust repair contracts in case things go wrong.  I'd only advocate this being done for routine outpatient stuff which doesn't require an immediate report.  I should add, we already do work regular nights/weekends in which we provide a good emergency service for any patient needing it. 

However, many procedures can't safely be done at the weekend due to the large numbers of people required in support.  A shift to 7/7 working will require either more staff or more pay.  I can't really see it happening.  You can't sustain a high intensity role in medicine without regular rest periods and routine working patterns and I doubt that the consultant body would consent to such a large-scale renegotiation of their job plans.  

The ""top comments"" in that BBC article are infuriating.  Seem to be a lot of feckless idiots who think they should be able to see their GP at any hour of the day or night.  There is a lot of hate out there for the medical profession.  The most down-voted comment is a part-time GP standing up for her rights as a mother to look after her children.  With that kind of opprobrium levelled at the medical profession by the general public and media, it's not surprising that a large number of UK-trained doctors emigrate to other countries, taking their training, expertise, tax payments and student loans with them. 

My partner is a GP and she says most of her patients at this time of year come in with the common cold or similar.  I think better education of patients as to when to seek help could go a long way.

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"&gt; Most people in rural areas don't work in agriculture, and the issues they face are bar a few bits and bobs similar to workers in urban environs.

The issues faced by rural workers are quite different to urban ones. For example, the public transport infrastructure is much worse in rural areas, making it harder for people to get to work. This limits the area that can search for jobs in, meaning that they might have to move far from family (which they can't them visit easily due to poor public transport), or become reliant on a car which they may not be able to afford.

There's also issues with education. Working class people in rural areas have no choice but to sent their kids to the local school, for which free transport is provided. It doesn't matter whether it's a good school or a bad one, or what its specialization is, there is not the means to send your kids anywhere else. They can't hop on a non-existent bus or walk 5 miles every morning. But most education policy in this country completely fails to take this into account. It acts as if all parents are city parents (or rich parents), with a choice of schools that are equally accessible.

&gt; Besides we vote on social issues as much as we vote on economic ones.

That's probably why these working class people vote tory. They think the tories are more sensitive to the needs of rural society than Labour or the Lib Dems. But there's no need to make them choose to vote on social issues OR economic ones.

Remember to get lots of pictures of fans on the streets and in the pubs as well, rather than just at the game.

There's a few little stalls outside the ground which sells all kinds of Chelsea stuff. Although they're not really my kind of thing, you should definitely check out the one which sells lots of little pin badges and stuff, there's loads to choose from and it might be a nice thing to take home as I can't imagine you can get them in Canada.

Make sure you check out the Megastore as well. Might be a good time to buy a shirt (jersey) as it's probably a lot cheaper than it is to buy one in Canada.

Try and get into the ground about 30-40 minutes before kick off so you can soak it all up, see the teams warming up before the match and watch as the stadium slowly fills up before kick off. Again, get loads of photos.

Stamford the Lion will be doing the rounds around the edge of the pitch so keep an eye out and if you're close enough go right down to the front as he passes and get a photo taken with him.

Take your seat, and enjoy! As for chanting, you'll hear them clear enough that you'll work out the words pretty quickly and can join in. Before the match this song will play - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZilLLobA3U#t=2m10s

It's simple enough to join in, wait until the high notes and afterwards you clap clap clap clap, then hands in the air and shout ""CHELSEA"" as loud as you can.

Americans can choose to amend the Constitution so that the right for a militia to carry weapons is no longer legal.

Certainly when the law was originally passed it was sensible, but the law should reflect life in the 21st century, not the 18th. Do Americans really need militias any more?

As to availability - certainly on day 1 of the new law banning ownership, gun crime will still be rampant. But guns wear out, are scrapped and not replaced.

Over time the USA will become a safer country because it will see the number of guns in casual circulation shrink from the 300 million they currently have.

...of course, this all requires a major change in attitudes.

One of the key differences between the USA and the rest of the world is individualism. In the USA, the debate isn't about whether a home owner should be allowed to kill a burglar, but how fast.

The rest of the world would prefer calling the police to be the default option, with the use of lethal force in self-defence limited to when absolutely necessary.

This is a fundamental difference between the cultures - and for Americans to cede gun ownership means they have to accept that the judicial system has some level of primacy over their actions.

In a country which is oddly tied up with lawyers and a police force that is more of a paramilitary organisation - the individuals are surprisingly reluctant to cede that control for the benefit of society in general.",0,1355741110,null,0,false,0,c7hwj02,t3_14zkry,t1_c7hwj02,t1_c7hwd8v,null,1430696576,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Crazy people who attack children need to seek help, but it's the role of regulation to prevent the guns getting into the hands of the insane *in the case* that  psychological treatment has broken down or failed the patient. Psychological assessments and waiting periods should become the norm, not the exception when it comes to buying firearms. 

I consider that regulated and limited firearm sales is the last, best hope for preventing these kind of crimes in addition to a blanket ban on fully- or semi-automatic rifles, pistols, extended magazines, semi-automatic shotguns, etc. Anything which makes it easier to kill a person should be criminalized.

I have no doubt we'll go down this season, but I don't mind. Everybody seems to believe that achieving stability within the Premier League is an immediate thing.

We could spend in January, giving ourselves no guarantee of survival, crash back down into the Championship, lose all our players due the relegation clauses on their contracts, and be skint. Or, we could buy ourselves decent prospects, as we've always done, crash down with a team committed to Reading, and have enough money to rebuild for another promotion push. And in five years, who knows - we could be doing a Portsmouth, or we could be doing a West Brom.

In lisburn I've seen a growth of people putting up flags, saw a few putting them up on Saturday.  The day after that shooting in america, instead of hugging their kids these guys are out giving two fingers to any peaceful protest and saying f**k you to anyone who dares to challenge them.

The reason there is such a silent majority in this country is that people are afraid that they'll get their houses burnt or shot or whatever at the hands of these mindless thugs, and fair enough its not worth it for me to complain if I risk getting my home burned.

The fact that they're out putting up flags in december to say f**k you to anyone who wants peace just goes to show that it will achieve nothing.

There we have alliance councilours in Larne and further afield being given death threats? why?? I have no idea, but it goes to reinforce the point.

Personally, I dont understand what the politicans in this country are doing.  Why do they always play to the lowest common denominator?  Why cant someone suggest that these people are infact idiots? why do they reinforce the small world view of these fools?



In my mind, a flag on a building in belfast means fuck all to me, if it was democratically taken by the people of that city then thats their problem.

Having read a lot into American style ownership (Being a firearm owner myself and finding it fascinating) I find that the... How can I put this ... Mindset/Cultural aspect of what these firearms mean to a lot of people is so different to what we are use to here than unless you factor that into your debate then its just missing out an extremely important aspect making the debate somewhat pointless. The idea of ""collective safety"" (I'm sure there is probably a technical term, some call it ""nanny state"") is somewhat understood here. But to many gun owners i've spoken to personal liberty is the utmost and trumps ""collective safety"" , they accept the perceived (Its debatable) danger for the increase in personal liberty. The famous quote from Benjamin Franklin highlights this greatly I feel:

&gt;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.

You might not agree with this mindset, or fully understand it, But if you don't factor it in when thinking about this you wont get anywhere as it somewhat makes the following paragraph about statistics irrelevant. 



The above is extremely important (And i find usually missed out) And this is before you even get into the typical statistics than are usually thrown about supporting both sides. I'm no statician but these stats, Like all crime stats are usually thrown around without any context what-so ever and a complete disregard to the immense amount of factors that contribute to them. Then the argument normally falls into both sides pulling out ever increasingly impossible theoretical imaginary scenarios out of their ass like this somehow proves their side of the argument.  



I feel I'm rambling so to sum up I feel both sides of the argument, At least on Reddit, Just don't line up and will never understand each other (Making the debate a big waste of time) because there is so much to it which people disregard that its just damn near impossible to fully understand it all and factor it into your debate.

Elsewhere on his blog, commenters are saying the police should be armed routinely. What happened to Jean Charles De Menezes tells me that arming more police would be a really bad idea.

The whole ""it could be worse"" argument doesn't sit very easily with me. So Police are shit elsewhere so we should accept a slightly less shit standard here?

&gt;So, in order to comply with the legal requirements for licence-free TV use and satisfy the TV Licensing authority, it makes sense to take some practical steps to ensure that a live TV signal cannot be received.

&gt;For this, the TV Licensing authority suggests disconnecting the TV aerial from the TV or set-top box and sealing the input socket with tape, but it’s also prudent to ‘de-tune’ the TV to prevent the accidental reception of channels.

&gt;With most modern TVs, you just need to retune (the option may be labelled ‘Search for new channels’ or similar) with the TV aerial unplugged: the TV will find no channels, so will be unable later to accidentally tune into one. Any other equipment whose sole purpose is to receive a live TV signal, such as a Freeview set-top box or standard satellite receiver, should be removed from the setup.

&gt;Any satellite or cable TV subscriptions should be cancelled. If there are recordings still to be watched on a DVR, its TV input should also be disconnected. Both satellite and cable TV services still require a TV licence, even if only ever used for premium subscription channels.

Exxageration much? Sure there are bad eggs and some of them have done some fucked up things and the MET isn't the shining beacon it should be. That said it frankly isn't that bad.

&gt; Many of the worst of humanity they are encountering are there working right beside them.

You really dont like the police do you?

&gt; He is saying that this kind of thing (mass shootings on a regular basis) doesn't happen here because people don't have firearms.

Hard to disprove, but I'd believe there is an element of truth to it.

&gt; Elsewhere on his blog, commenters are saying the police should be armed routinely. 

You're holding up commenters as a representation of his views? Shall we do the same with other sites? 

&gt; What happened to Jean Charles De Menezes tells me that arming more police would be a really bad idea.

Police make mistakes too, in this case tragically so. However, in defence of the police this came shortly after a major terrorist attack and on balance one death against hundreds well, sometimes you make a call and take the one death. Scant comfort to his family and friends - and the police did have a lot of blame to take for it.

&gt; The whole ""it could be worse"" argument doesn't sit very easily with me. So Police are shit elsewhere so we should accept a slightly less shit standard here? 

We shouldn't accept it but we should realise that our system is overall doing a reasonable job.

&gt; At the point you are paying people to enforce the law and giving them lots of power over their fellow citizens, those people should be held to the very highest standards. And by and large, they are not.

You can say the same for every single public sector employee.

&gt; It is this sentence: ""I say this in light of my experience of the rage, anger, strange moral compass and general mind altering substance abuse of the kind of people we deal with,"" that makes me think the author is a hypocrite, because he is describing many of the Police strutting around the streets of our country. For example PC Simon Harwood.

Certainly fits the bill - with a playmaker, proper DM and a dribbler. The assumption I'm making is that he wants to have a similar setup, which he might not.

Well, Hillsborough tells me that whole forces are colluding in criminal behaviour. Obviously not all police are criminals.

""You're holding up commenters as a representation of his views?""

Forgot to add him into that sentence. He also supports the routine arming of all police. http://inspectorgadget.wordpress.com/category/inspector-gadget-supports-the-routine-arming-of-all-uk-frontline-police-officers-and-is-against-the-single-crew-policy-for-response-police/

""Police make mistakes too, in this case tragically so. However, in defence of the police this came shortly after a major terrorist attack and on balance one death against hundreds well, sometimes you make a call and take the one death. Scant comfort to his family and friends - and the police did have a lot of blame to take for it.""

Yes, this mistake was entirely preventable. They took blame, but not any punishment. It occurred because one of the surveillance officers was on the toilet. After which they followed the wrong man and allowed him onto two different forms of public transport before executing him by repeatedly firing rounds into his body in an enclosed space surrounded by members of the public. That is a whole series of really stupid mistakes. And no one was punished. 

Bit like the manslaughter of Ian Tomlinson, where, once again no one was punished. Bit like all those deaths in the article I posted above, where, once again, no one was punished. 

Obviously, measuring what a reasonable job looks like for a police force is going to be tough. I would argue that they are doing a less than reasonable job in a number of areas. Most inner city young people, who are most likely to be victims as well as perpetrators of crimes, would rather not turn to police due to repeated harassment. The way police deal with rape in this country would be laughable if the effects were not so tragic. As I explained, for people who are supposed to have moral authority over me, stuff like Hillsborough and the subsequent cover up should just not be happening ever.

""You can say the same for every single public sector employee.""
1) No you can't. A bin man or a fire man cannot enforce the law against you except in the form of a citizens arrest.
2) Nurses, Drs, Social Workers etc are regularly prosecuted for misdeeds committed on the job.
3) None of those public sector employees except the police can legally choose to take your freedom away for arbitrary reasons at their whim. Or destroy your property. Or assault you. 

""In which case you are no better than the blogger since you're making sweeping generalisations bvased on the evidence of a handful of officers. So congratulations - you too are a hypocrit! :)""

Any hypothetical government of the US that might turn its guns on the population isn't going to happen overnight and it isn't going to happen without popular support. If they have popular support they can quite easily turn the majority against some target minority and the minority being armed becomes irrelevant.

Afghanistan is a case in point. There we see a non-tyrannical government trying to occupy land, and it's a complete mess. A tyrannical one could simply carpet bomb entire towns into obeisance.

My broad point, this sort of thing would only be effective against a non-tyrannical government, the plausible sort of tyrannical government that might arise in the US would not have a problem with it. Look at Nazi Germany, do you imagine that had the Jews been armed things would have gone better for them?

There is nothing I could do to a normal bobby that would end my life, and this means I'm not afraid to ask a police officer for directions or to help them. 

The fact that law abiding citizens have nothing to fear from the police is  something I would sorely miss if I went to america. Even if I was just minding my own business and the police opened fire on a criminal, what is to say a stray bullet wouldnt hit me? (although the police use hollow points so that bullets do not travel beyond the target and cause further damage to bystanders)

the risk of death is one of the risks taken on by police officers, they know they are targets, but the equipment they currently have is enough to protect themselves. i have seen more and more officers with tasers around recently, and while this is a step in the wrong direction, as long as it goes no further I have no problem with it.
